 The bulk of the volume is made up of writings in which Lenin analyses the socio-economic and political causes of the growth of a new revolution in Russia, elaborates thetactics to be followed by the Bolshevik Party in the condi-tions of the new revolutionary upswing, and exposes thecounter-revolutionary nature of the liberal bourgeoisie andthe treacherous part played by the Menshevik liquidators, Trotskyists and Vperyodists in the working-class move-ment. 
 Among them are the articles “The RevolutionaryUpswing” and “Political Parties in Russia”, the pamphletThe Present Situation in the R.

 THE FOURTH DUMA ELECTION CAMPAIGN AND THE TASKS OF THE REVOLUTIONARY SOCIAL -DEMOCRATS The political strikes and the first demonstrations over the Lena shootings1 show that the revolutionary movement among the masses of workers in Russia is growing. 
 Thisthickening of the revolutionary atmosphere casts a vividlight on the tasks of the Party and its role in the electioncampaign. 
 The crisis is growing in a new situation. 
 The reactionary Duma, 2 a which provides the landlords with power, the bourgeoisie with an arena for making deals, and the proletar-iat with a small platform, is a necessary factor in this situa-tion. 
 We need this platform, we need the election campaign,for our revolutionary work among the masses. 
 We need the illegal Party to direct all this work as a whole—in the Taurida Palace, as well as in Kazanskaya Square, 3 at work-ers’ mass meetings, during strikes, at district meetings ofworker Social-Democrats, and at open trade union meet-ings. 
 Only the hopelessly blind can fail even now to see theutter absurdity and perniciousness for the working classof otzovism and liquidationism, 4 those products of decay and disintegration during the period of the triumph of coun-ter-revolution. 
 The example of the Narodniks has shown usclearly the scandalous zero one gets as the result of adding the liquidationism of the “Trudoviks”, as well as of the legally functioning writers of Russkoye Bogatstvo 5 a nd Sov-remennik ,6 to the otzovism of the Socialist-Revolutionary “party”. 
 Let us now sum up the facts brought to light during the pre-election mobilisation of political forces. 
 Three camps stand out clearly: (1) The Rights —from Purishkevich to Guchkov—are pro-government. 
 The Black-Hundred7 land-lord and the conservative merchant are heart and soul for the government. 
 (2) The liberal bourgeois—the “Progress-ists” and the Cadets, along with groups of various non-Russians—are against the government and against the revolution. 
 The counter-revolutionary nature of the liberalsis one of the main features of the present historical juncture. 
 Whoever does not see this counter-revolutionary nature of the “cultured” bourgeoisie has forgotten everything andlearned nothing, and takes the name of democrat, to saynothing of socialist, in vain. 
 As it happens, the Trudoviksand “our” liquidators see poorly and understand thingspoorly! (3) The democratic camp, in which only the revo-lutionary Social-Democrats, the anti-liquidationists, united and organised, have firmly and clearly unfurled their own banner, the banner of revolution. 
 The Trudoviks and ourliquidators are vacillating between the liberals and the democrats, between legal opposition and revolution. 
 The class roots which brought about the division between the first two camps are clear. 
 But the liberals have succeededin leading astray many people, from Vodovozov to Dan, asto the class roots which divided the second camp from thethird. 
 The liberal “strategy”, naïvely blurted out by Blankin Zaprosy Zhizni , 8 is very simple: the Cadets are the centre of the opposition, the thill-horse; the outrunners (the “flanks”) are the Progressists on the right, and the Trudoviks and the liquidators on the left. 
 It is on this “troika” that the Milyu-kovs, in their role of “responsible opposition”, hope to“ride” to triumph. 
 The hegemony of the liberals in the Russian emancipation movement has always meant, and will always mean, defeat for this movement. 
 The liberals manoeuvre between themonarchy of the Purishkeviches and the revolution of theworkers and peasants, betraying the latter at every serious juncture. 
 The task of the revolution is to use the liberals’ fight against the government and to neutralise their vacilla-tions and treachery. 
 The policy of the liberals is to scare Purishkevich and Romanov a little with the prospect of revolution, in order toshare power with them and jointly suppress the revolution. 
 And it is the class position of the bourgeoisie that deter-mines this policy. 
 Hence the Cadets’ cheap “democracy” and their actual fusion with the most moderate “Progress-ists” of the type of Yefremov, Lvov, Ryabushinsky and Co. 
 The tactics of the proletarian Party should be to use the fight between the liberals and the Purishkeviches over the division of power—without in any way allowing “faith” in the liberals to take hold among the people—in order to develop, intensify and reinforce the revolutionary onslaught of the masses, which overthrows the monarchy and entirelywipes out the Purishkeviches and Romanovs. 
 At the elec-tions, its tactics should be to unite the democrats against the Rights and against the Cadets by “using” the liberals’ fight against the Rights in cases of a second ballot, in the press and at meetings. 
 Hence the necessity for a revolution-ary platform that even now goes beyond the bounds of“legality”. 
 Hence the slogan of a republic—as against theliberals ’ “constitutional ” slogans, slogans of a “Rasputin-Treshchenkov constitution ”. 
 9 Our task is to train an army of champions of the revolution everywhere, always, in all forms of work, in every field of activity, at every turn of events which may be forced on us by a victory ofreaction, the treachery of the liberals, the protraction ofthe crisis, etc. 
 Look at the Trudoviks. 
 They are Narodnik liquidators sans phrases . 
 “We are revolutionaries,” Mr. 
 Vodovozov “hints”, “ but—we can’t go against Article 129, 10” he adds. 
 A hundred years after Herzen’s birth, the “party” of thepeasant millions is unable to publish even a sheet—even ahectographed one!—in defiance of Article 129!! While grav-itating towards a bloc “first of all” with the Social-Demo-crats, the Trudoviks are unable to say clearly that the Cadets are counter-revolutionary, to lay the foundations for a republican peasant party. 
 Yet that is exactly how the ques-tion stands after the lessons of 1905-07 and 1908-11: eitherfight for a republic, or lick the boots of Purishkevich andgrovel under the whips of Markov and Romanov. 
 There isno other choice for the peasants. 
 Look at the liquidators. 
 No matter how much the Marty-novs, Martovs and Co. 
 shift and shuffle, any conscientious and sensible reader will recognise that R—kov 11 summed up their views when he said: “Let there be no illusion. 
 What is in the making is the triumph of a very moderate bourgeois progressism. 
 ” The objectiv e meaning of this winged phrase is the following: revolution is an illusion, the real thing is to support the “Progressists”. 
 Surely anyone who does not de-liberately close his eyes must see now that it is precisely this that the Dans and Martovs are saying, in slightly differentwords, when they issue the slogan: “Wrest the Duma [the Fourth Duma, a landlord-ridden Duma!] * from the hands of the reactionaries”? Or when they make, again and again, the slip of referring to two camps? Or when they shout, “Do notfrustrate” the progressive work of the liberal bourgeois?Or when they fight against a “Left bloc”? Or when, writingin Zhivoye Dyelo , 12 they smugly snap their fingers at “the literature published abroad which nobody reads”? Or whenthey actually content themselves with a legal platform and legal attempts at organisation? Or when they form “ini-tiating groups” 13 of liquidators, thus breaking with the revolutionary R.

P. 
? Is it not clear that this is alsothe tune sung by the Levitskys, who are lending philosophi-cal depth to the liberal ideas about the struggle for right, by the Nevedomskys, who have lately “revised” Dobrolyu-bov’s 14 ideas backwards— from democracy to liberalism—and by the Smirnovs, who are making eyes at “progressism”, andby all the other knights of Nasha Zarya 15 and Zhivoye Dyelo ? Actually the democrats and the Social-Democrats, even if they had wanted to, would never have been able to “frus-trate” a victory of the “Progressists” among the landlordsand bourgeois! All this is nothing but idle talk. 
 This is notwhere the serious differences lie. 
 Nor is this what consti-tutes the distinction between a liberal and a Social-Democ-ratic labour policy. 
 To “support” the Progressists on the ground that their “victories” “bring the cultured bourgeoisnearer to power” is a liberal labour policy. 
 We Social-Democrats regard a “victory” of the Progress-ists as an indirect expression of a democratic upswing. 
 It is necessary to use the skirmishes between the Progressists and *Interpolations in square brackets (within passages quoted by Lenin) have been introduced by Lenin, unless otherwise indicated. 
— Ed. 
 the Rights—the mere slogan of support for the Progressists is no good. 
 Our job is to promote the democratic upswing, to foster the new revolutionary democracy that is growing in a new way in the new Russia. 
 Unless it succeeds ingathering strength and winning in spite of the liberals, no “triumph” of the Progressists and the Cadets in the electionswill bring about any serious change in the actual situationin Russia. 
 The democratic upswing is an indisputable fact now. 
 It is progressing with greater difficulty, at a slower pace andalong a more arduous path than we should like, but it isprogressing nonetheless. 
 It is this that we must “support” and promote by our election work and every other kind ofactivity. 
 Our task is to organise the revolutionary demo-crats—by ruthless criticism of Narodnik liquidationism and Narodnik otzovism to forge a republican peasant party—but first of all and above all else to clean “our own house”of liquidationism and otzovism, intensify our revolutionarySocial-Democratic work among the proletariat and strength-en the illegal Social-Democratic Labour Party. 
 The out-come of the growing revolutionary crisis does not depend on us; it depends on a thousand different causes, on the revo-lution in Asia and on socialism in Europe. 
 But it does dependon us to conduct consistent and steady work among themasses in the spirit of Marxism, and only this kind of workis never done in vain. 
 Sotsial-Demokrat No. 
 26, Published according May 8 (April 25), 1912 to the text in Sotsial-Demokrat THE LIQUIDATORS AGAINST THE PARTY The liquidators of all shades, writing in the legal Russia press, are conducting a campaign of slander against the Par-ty Conference16 with an easy shamelessness which might well be envied by the Bulgarins and Burenins. 
17 The articles in Zhivoye Dyelo , which openly question the delegates as to who sent them and, under the protection of the censor-ship, attack what cannot be defended in the legal press,exemplify such disregard for the elementary rules of literary decency that they are bound not only to evoke protests from the adherents of the Conference, but also to disgustany fair-minded political leader. 
 As for the articles of theanonymous informer of Vorwärts , 18 they reek of shameless braggadocio and florid lying so overpoweringly as not topermit of any doubt that the liquidators’ order for them found itself in experienced hands. 
 * Driven into a corner, the groups and circles of liquidators do not confine themselves, however, to a campaign of slan-der against the Party. 
 They are trying to convene a confer-ence of their own. 
 Every measure has been taken, of course,to lend the Organising Committee, 19 which is to convene this conference, the semblance of a “pro-Party”, “non-factional”, “unity” body. 
 After all, these are such convenient words—when the liquidators want to hook all those who for somereason are dissatisfied with the Party Conference.

 And he did sing them—in every variety of type his Vienna printer could find: “The support-ers of Vperyod and Golos , pro-Party Bolsheviks, pro-Party Mensheviks, 20 so-called liquidators and non-factionalists— in Russia and abroad—are firmly supporting the work...” of the Organising Committee.

 The bloc under the hegemony of the liquidators,which was being prepared in opposition to the Conferenceof 1912 with so much fuss, is now bursting at the seams andthe reason is that the liquidators have shown their hand too openly. 
 The Poles refused to take part in the Organising Committee. 
 Plekhanov, through correspondence with arepresentative of the Committee, established several interest-ing details, to wit: (1) that what is planned is a “constitu-ent” conference, i. 
e. 
, not a conference of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
,but of some new party; (2) that it is being convened on “anar-chical” lines; (3) that the “conference is being convened by the liquidators”. 
 After these circumstances had beenrevealed by Comrade Plekhanov, there was nothing surpris-ing to us in the fact that the so-called Bolshevik (?!) conci-liators plucked up courage and resolved to convict Trotskyof—having told a lie by listing them among the supporters of the Organising Committee. 
 “This Organising Committee, as it is now constituted, with its obvious tendency to im-pose upon the whole Party its own attitude to the liquida-tors, and with the principles of organisational anarchy whichit has made the basis for increasing its membership, doesnot provide the least guarantee that a really general Party conference will be convened. 
” That is how our emboldened “pro-Party” people comment on the Organising Committeetoday. 
 We do not know where the most Leftist of our Left—the Vperyod group, who at one time hastened to signify its sympathy with the Organising Committee—stand today. 
Nor is this of any importance. 
 The important thing is that the liquidationist character of the conference to be held by the Organising Committee has been established by Ple-khanov with irrefutable clarity, and that the statesmanlike minds of the “conciliators” had to bow to this fact. 
 Who remains, then? The open liquidators and Trotsky. 
 The basis of this bloc is obvious: the liquidators enjoy full freedom to pursue their line in Zhivoye Dyelo and Nasha Zarya “as before”, while Trotsky, operating abroad, screens them with r-r-revolutionary phrases, which cost himnothing and do not bind them in any way. 
 There is one little lesson to be drawn from this affair by those abroad who are sighing for unity, and who recently hatched the sheet Za Partiyu 22 in Paris. 
 To build up a party, it is not enough to be able to shout “unity”; it isalso necessary to have a political programme, a programme of political action. 
 The bloc comprising the liquidators,Trotsky, the Vperyod group, the Poles, the pro-Party Bol-sheviks (?), the Paris Mensheviks, and so on and so forth, was foredoomed to ignominious failure, because it wasbased on an unprincipled approach, on hypocrisy and hol-low phrases. 
 As for those who sigh, it would not be amissif they finally made up their minds on that extremely com-plicated and difficult question: With whom do they want to have unity? If it is with the liquidators, why not say so without mincing? But if they are against unity with theliquidators, then what sort of unity are they sighing for? The January Conference and the bodies it elected are the only thing that actually unites all the R.

 functiona-ries in Russia today. 
 Apart from the Conference there is only the promise of the Bundists 23 and Trotsky to convene the liquidationist conference of the Organising Committee, andthe “conciliators” who are experiencing their liquidation-ist hang-over. 
 Sotsial-Demokrat No. 
 26, Published according May 8 (April 25), 1912 to the text in Sotsial-Demokrat IN MEMORY OF HERZEN One hundred years have elapsed since Herzen’s birth. 
 The whole of liberal Russia is paying homage to him, studiouslyevading, however, the serious questions of socialism, andtaking pains to conceal that which distinguished Herzen the revolutionary from a liberal. 
 The Right-wing press, too, is commemorating the Herzen centenary, falsely asserting thatin his last years Herzen renounced revolution. 
 And in theorations on Herzen that are made by the liberals and Narod-niks abroad, phrase-mongering reigns supreme. 
 The working-class party should commemorate the Herzen centenary, not for the sake of philistine glorification, but for the purpose of making clear its own tasks and ascer-taining the place actually held in history by this writer whoplayed a great part in paving the way for the Russian revo-lution. 
 Herzen belonged to the generation of revolutionaries among the nobility and landlords of the first half of the last century. 
 The nobility gave Russia the Birons and Arakche-yevs, 24 innumerable “drunken officers, bullies, gamblers, heroes of fairs, masters of hounds, roisterers, floggers,pimps”, as well as amiable Manilovs. 
 25 “But,” wrote Her-zen, “among them developed the men of December 14,26 a phalanx of heroes reared, like Romulus and Remus, onthe milk of a wild beast .... 
 They were veritable titans, hammered out of pure steel from head to foot, comrades-in-arms who deliberately went to certain death in order toawaken the young generation to a new life and to purify thechildren born in an environment of tyranny and servility. 
” 27 Herzen was one of those children. 
 The uprising of the Decembrists awakened and “purified” him. 
 In the feudalRussia of the forties of the nineteenth century, he rose to a height which placed him on a level with the greatest think-ers of his time. 
 He assimilated Hegel’s dialectics. 
 He realised that it was “the algebra of revolution”. 
 He went further than Hegel, following Feuerbach to materialism. 
 The first ofhis Letters on the Study of Nature , “Empiricism and Ideal-ism”, written in 1844, reveals to us a thinker who even nowstands head and shoulders above the multitude of modernempiricist natural scientists and the host of present-day idealist and semi-idealist philosophers. 
 Herzen came right up to dialectical materialism, and halted—before historicalmaterialism. 
 It was this “halt” that caused Herzen’s spiritual ship-wreck after the defeat of the revolution of 1848. 
 Herzen hadleft Russia, and observed this revolution at close range. 
 He was at that time a democrat, a revolutionary, a socialist. 
 But his “socialism” was one of the countless forms and va-rieties of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois socialism of the periodof 1848, which were dealt their death-blow in the June daysof that year. 
 In point of fact, it was not socialism at all, butso many sentimental phrases, benevolent visions, which were the expression at that time of the revolutionary character of the bourgeois democrats, as well as of the proletariat, whichhad not yet freed itself from the influence of those democrats. 
 Herzen’s spiritual shipwreck, his deep scepticism and pessimism after 1848, was a shipwreck of the bourgeois illusions of socialism. 
 Herzen’s spiritual drama was a pro-duct and reflection of that epoch in world history when the revolutionary character of the bourgeois democrats wasalready passing away (in Europe), while the revolutionary character of the socialist proletariat had not yet matured. 
 This is something the Russian knights of liberal verbiage,who are now covering up their counter-revolutionary nature by florid phrases about Herzen’s scepticism, did not and could not understand. 
 With these knights, who betrayed theRussian revolution of 1905, and have even forgotten to thinkof the great name of revolutionary , scepticism is a form of transition from democracy to liberalism, to that toadying,vile, foul and brutal liberalism which shot down the workers in 1848, restored the shattered thrones and applauded Napo-leon III, and which Herzen cursed , unable to understand its class nature. 
 With Herzen, scepticism was a form of transition from the illusion of a bourgeois democracy that is “above classes” to the grim, inexorable and invincible class struggle of the proletariat. 
 The proof: the Letters to an Old Comrade — to Bakunin—written by Herzen in 1869, a year before hisdeath. 
 In them Herzen breaks with the anarchist Bakunin. 
True, Herzen still sees this break as a mere disagreementon tactics and not as a gulf between the world outlook of the proletarian who is confident of the victory of his class and that of the petty bourgeois who has despaired of his salva-tion. 
 True enough, in these letters as well, Herzen repeatsthe old bourgeois-democratic phrases to the effect that social-ism must preach “a sermon addressed equally to workmanand master, to farmer and townsman”. 
 Nevertheless, in breaking with Bakunin, Herzen turned his gaze, not to liberalism, but to the International —to the International led by Marx, to the International which had begun to“rally the legions ” of the proletariat, to unite “ the world of labour ”, which is “abandoning the world of those who enjoy without working”. 
 28 Failing as he did to understand the bourgeois-democratic character of the entire movement of 1848 and of all the formsof pre-Marxian socialism, Herzen was still less able to un-derstand the bourgeois nature of the Russian revolution. 
 Herzen is the founder of “Russian” socialism, of “Naro-dism”. 
 He saw “socialism” in the emancipation of thepeasants with land , in community land tenure 29 and in the peasant idea of “the right to land”. 
 He set forth his petideas on this subject an untold number of times. 
 Actually, there is not a grain of socialism in this doctrine of Herzen’s, as, indeed, in the whole of Russian Narodism, including the faded Narodism of the present-day Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
 Like the various forms of “the socialism of1848” in the West, this is the same sort of sentimentalphrases, of benevolent visions, in which is expressed therevolutionism of the bourgeois peasant democracy in Rus-sia. 
 The more land the peasants would have received in 1861 30 and the less they would have had to pay for it, the more would the power of the feudal landlords have been undermined and the more rapidly, freely and widely would capitalism have developed in Russia. 
 The idea of the “right to land” and of “equalised division of the land” is nothing but a formulation of the revolutionary aspiration for equali-ty cherished by the peasants who are fighting for the com-plete overthrow of the power of the landlords, for the com-plete abolition of landlordism. 
 This was fully proved by the revolution of 1905: on the one hand, the proletariat came out quite independently at the head of the revolutionary struggle, having founded theSocial-Democratic Labour Party; on the other hand, therevolutionary peasants (the Trudoviks and the PeasantUnion 31), who fought for every form of the abolition of land-lordism even to “the abolition of private landownership”, fought precisely as proprietors, as small entrepreneurs. 
 Today, the controversy over the “socialist nature” of the right to land, and so on, serves only to obscure and cover up the really important and serious historical question concern-ing the difference of interests of the liberal bourgeoisie and the revolutionary peasantry in the Russian bourgeois revolu-tion; in other words, the question of the liberal and the dem-ocratic, the “compromising” (monarchist) and the repub-lican trends manifested in that revolution. 
 This is exactlythe question posed by Herzen’s Kolokol , 32 if we turn our attention to the essence of the matter and not to the words,if we investigate the class struggle as the basis of “theories” and doctrines and not vice versa. 
 Herzen founded a free Russian press abroad, and that is the great service rendered by him. 
 Polyarnaya Zvezda 33 took up the tradition of the Decembrists. 
 Kolokol (1857-67) cham-pioned the emancipation of the peasants with might andmain. 
 The slavish silence was broken. 
 But Herzen came from a landlord, aristocratic milieu. 
 He had left Russia in 1847; he had not seen the revolutionarypeople and could have no faith in it. 
 Hence his liberalappeal to the “upper ranks”. 
 Hence his innumerable sugaryletters in Kolokol addressed to Alexander II the Hangman, which today one cannot read without revulsion. 
 Chernyshev-sky, Dobrolyubov and Serno-Solovyevich, who represented the new generation of revolutionary raznochintsi, 34 were a thousand times right when they reproached Herzen for these departures from democracy to liberalism. 
 However, it must be said in fairness to Herzen that, much as he vacillated between democracy and liberalism, the democrat in him gained the upper hand nonetheless. 
 When Kavelin, one of the most repulsive exponents of liberal servility—who at one time was enthusiastic aboutKolokol precisely because of its liberal tendencies—rose in arms against a constitution, attacked revolutionary agi-tation, rose against “violence” and appeals for it, and began to preach tolerance, Herzen broke with that liberal sage. 
 Herzen turned upon Kavelin’s “meagre, absurd, harmfulpamphlet” written “for the private guidance of a govern-ment pretending to be liberal”; he denounced Kavelin’s“sentimental political maxims” which represented “the Rus-sian people as cattle and the government as an embodiment of intelligence”. 
 Kolokol printed an article entitled “Epi-taph”, which lashed out against “professors weaving the rot-ten cobweb of their superciliously paltry ideas, ex-profes-sors, once open-hearted and subsequently embittered becausethey saw that the healthy youth could not sympathise with their scrofulous thinking”. 
 Kavelin at once recognised him-self in this portrait. 
 When Chernyshevsky was arrested, the vile liberal Kave-lin wrote: “I see nothing shocking in the arrests ... the revo-lutionary party considers all means fair to overthrow thegovernment, and the latter defends itself by its own means. 
” As if in retort to this Cadet, Herzen wrote concerning Cher-nyshevsky’s trial: “And here are wretches, weed-like people,jellyfish, who say that we must not reprove the gang of rob-bers and scoundrels that is governing us. 
” When the liberal Turgenev 35 wrote a private letter to Alexander II assuring him of his loyalty, and donated two goldpieces for the soldiers wounded during the suppression of the Polish insurrection, Kolokol wrote of “the grey-haired Magdalen (of the masculine gender) who wrote to the tsarto tell him that she knew no sleep because she was tormentedby the thought that the tsar was not aware of the repentancethat had overcome her”. 
 And Turgenev at once recognised himself. 
 When the whole band of Russian liberals scurried away from Herzen for his defence of Poland, when the whole of “educated society” turned its back on Kolokol , Herzen was not dismayed. 
 He went on championing the freedom of Po-land and lashing the suppressors, the butchers, the hangmen in the service of Alexander II. 
 Herzen saved the honour ofRussian democracy. 
 “We have saved the honour of the Rus-sian name,” he wrote to Turgenev, “and for doing so we havesuffered at the hands of the slavish majority. 
 ” When it was reported that a serf peasant had killed a landlord for an attempt to dishonour the serf’s betrothed, Herzen commented in Kolokol : “Well done!” When it was reported that army officers would be appointed to supervisethe “peaceable” progress of “emancipation”, Herzen wrote:“The first wise colonel who with his unit joins the peasantsinstead of crushing them, will ascend the throne of the Ro-manovs. 
” When Colonel Reitern shot himself in Warsaw (1860) because he did not want to be a helper of hangmen,Herzen wrote: “If there is to be any shooting, the ones to beshot should be the generals who give orders to fire uponunarmed people. 
” When fifty peasants were massacred inBezdna, and their leader, Anton Petrov, was executed (April 12, 1861), Herzen wrote in Kolokol : “If only my words could reach you, toiler and sufferer of the land of Russia !... How w ell I would teach you to despise your spiri-tual shepherds, placed over you by the St. 
 Petersburg Synod and a German tsar .... 
 You hate the landlord, you hate the official, you fear them, and rightly so; but you still believe in the tsar and thebishop ... do not believe them. 
 The tsar is with them, and they arehis men. 
 It is him you now see—you, the father of a youth murderedin Bezdna, and you, the son of a father murdered in Penza .... 
 Your shepherds are as ignorant as you, and as poor .... 
 S uch was another Anthony (not Bishop Anthony, but Anton of Bezdna) who suffered for you in Kazan .... 
 The dead bodies of your martyrs will not per-form forty-eight miracles, and praying to them will not cure a tooth-ache; but their living memory may produce one miracle—youremancipation. 
” This shows how infamously and vilely Herzen is being slandered by our liberals entrenched in the slavish “legal”press, who magnify Herzen’s weak points and say nothing about his strong points. 
 It was not Herzen’s fault but his misfortune that he could not see the revolutionary peoplein Russia itself in the 1840s. 
 When in the sixties he came to see the revolutionary people, he sided fearlessly with therevolutionary democracy against liberalism. 
 He fought for a victory of the people over tsarism, not for a deal between the liberal bourgeoisie and the landlords’ tsar. 
 He raised aloft the banner of revolution. 
 In commemorating Herzen, we clearly see the three gen-erations, the three classes, that were active in the Russianrevolution. 
 At first it was nobles and landlords, the Decem-brists and Herzen. 
 These revolutionaries formed but a nar-row group. 
 They were very far removed from the people. 
But their effort was not in vain. 
 The Decembrists awakenedHerzen. 
 Herzen began the work of revolutionary agitation. 
 This work was taken up, extended, strengthened, and tempered by the revolutionary raznochintsi—from Cherny-shevsky to the heroes of Narodnaya Volya. 
 36 The range of fighters widened; their contact with the people became closer. 
“The young helmsmen of the gathering storm” is what Herz-en called them. 
 But it was not yet the storm itself. 
 The storm is the movement of the masses themselves. 
 The proletariat, the only class that is thoroughly revolutionary, rose at the head of the masses and for the first time aroused millions of peasants to open revolutionary struggle. 
 Thefirst onslaught in this storm took place in 1905. 
 The nextis beginning to develop under our very eyes. 
 In commemorating Herzen, the proletariat is learning from his example to appreciate the great importance of rev-olutionary theory. 
 It is learning that selfless devotion to the revolution and revolutionary propaganda among the peopleare not wasted even if long decades divide the sowing fromthe harvest. 
 It is learning to ascertain the role of the variousclasses in the Russian and in the international revolution. 
Enriched by these lessons, the proletariat will fight its way to a free alliance with the socialist workers of all lands, having crushed that loathsome monster, the tsarist mon-archy, against which Herzen was the first to raise the greatbanner of struggle by addressing his free Russian word to the masses. 
 Sotsial-Demokrat No. 
 26, Published according May 8 (April 25), 1912 to the text in Sotsial-Demokrat LANDOWNERSHIP IN EUROPEAN RUSSIA The famine that has affected thirty million peasants has again revived the question of the condition of the peasantryin Russia. 
 In discussing this question people usually over-look the main point, namely, the interrelation between the existence of large landed estates, primarily in the handsof the nobility, and the condition of the peasantry. 
 It isto this main point that we wish to draw the attention of thereader. 
 In 1907, the Ministry of the Interior published a volume of Statistics of Landownership in 1905 . 
 From these official data, which can under no circumstances be suspected of par-tiality for the peasants, we can obtain a fairly accurate ideaof one of the main causes of the famines. 
 The government statistics put the amount of land in the fifty gubernias of European Russia at 395 million dessia-tines. 
 But this figure does not represent the real state of af-fairs, since it includes more than 100 million dessiatines ofstate land in the far north, in the Archangel, Olonets andVologda gubernias. 
 Most of this land is unsuitable for farm-ing, being the tundra and forests of the far north. 
 Referenceto this land is usually made for the sole purpose of obscuring the actual distribution of the cultivable land. 
 If we deduct this land, we obtain a total of 280 million dessiatines (in round figures) of usable land. 
 Out of this total101 million dessiatines are listed as privately owned, and139 million dessiatines as allotment land. 
 It is necessary todistinguish between the land in the possession of the big landlords and that owned by small peasants. 
 As regards the large estates, government statistics provide the following data: Privately-Owned Land in European Russia NumberAverage Size of estates ofTotal land per estate estates(dessiatines) (dessia-tines) Over 500 to 2,000 dessiatines 21,748 20,590,708 947 Over 2,000 to 10,000 dessia-tines . 
 ....... 
 5,386 20,602,109 3,825 Over 10,000 dessiatines ... 699 20,798,504 29,754 Total ....... 
 27,833 61,991,321 2,227 These figures are incomplete, because they do not include the lands belonging to the crown, to big commercial com-panies, etc. 
 Nevertheless, these figures give us an idea of themain feature of Russian landlordism. 
 Seven hundred land-lords own 21 million dessiatines, i. 
e. 
, nearly thirty thousand dessiatines each . 
 Less than 28 thousand landlords own 62 million dessia-tines of land, i. 
e. 
, an average of 2,200 dessiatines per estate . 
 To this should be added the crown lands—their total isestimated to exceed five million dessiatines—and more than three and a half million dessiatines belonging to 272 “com-mercial, industrial, factory and other” companies. 
 The lat-ter are undoubtedly big estates, most of them in Perm Gu-bernia, where nine such companies own nearly one and a half million dessiatines of land (the exact figure is 1,448,902). 
 Consequently, the total land area in the hands of the big-gest owners is certainly not less, and most likely more, than 70 million dessiatines. 
 The number of such big landlords is less than 30 thousand . 
 Now take the land owned by the peasants. 
 According to government statistics, the peasants with the smallestallotments had the following amounts of land: Allotment Land Average per Size of allotmentsNumber of Total landhousehold(dessiatines) households(dessiatines) Less than 5 dessiatines 2,857,650 9,030,333 3.

7 Total .... 
 10,107,736 72,919,806 7. 
0 Consequently, ten million peasant families, out of a total of about 13 million, own 73 million dessiatines of land . 
 The average per household is seven dessiatines. 
 To this should be added the small privately-owned estates. 
 Thenumber of owners of farms of less than 10 dessiatines eachis placed at 409,864, and they own a total of 1,625,226 des-siatines of land, i. 
e. 
, less than four dessiatines per house-hold. 
 Consequently, we have a total of approximately ten and a half million peasant families with 75 million dessia-tines of land. 
 Now we can place side by side these principal figures, which are very often forgotten or misrepresented in argu-ments about the peasant problem: Large landed estates— 30 thousand owners, 70 million dessiatines of land. 
 Small peasant farms— ten and a half million owners, 75 million dessiatines of land. 
 To be sure, these are the gross figures. 
 For a more detailed study of the condition of the peasants and the role of the bigestates, it is necessary to take the figures for the various regions or districts, sometimes even for the individual gu-bernias. 
 But the economists of the government, the liberaland even, to a certain extent, the Narodnik camps very oftenobscure the essence of the land problem by referring to indi-vidual regions or to particular aspects of the problem. 
 Toget at the root of the land problem and of the condition of the peasants, we must not lose sight of the main figures cited above; we must not allow the main point to be obscuredby particulars. 
 In our next article, * we shall cite instances of this kind of obscuring. 
 For the present, we will make the first fundamen-tal summary. 
 The land in European Russia is so distributed that the big landlords, those owning more than 500 dessiatines each,hold 70 million dessiatines, and the number of such landlordsis less than 30 thousand. 
 On the other hand, the vast majority of the peasants, namely, ten and a half million families out of 13 million peasant families, own 75 million dessiatines of land. 
 *See pp. 
 73-77 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 The average large landed estate is 2,200 dessiatines . 
 The average size of a small peasant farm is seven dessiatines. 
 If the land of the thirty thousand big landlords were transferred to ten million peasant households, the land heldby these households would be nearly doubled . 
 In our next article, we shall discuss the economic rela-tions between the landlords and the peasants resulting fromthis distribution of the land.

 3, Published according May 6, 1912 to the text in Nevskaya Zvezda Signed: R. 
 Silin THE TRUDOVIKS AND THE WORKER DEMOCRATS The Fourth Duma election campaign has brought about some little revival of activity and has increased the interestin political issues. 
 The broad movement stirred up by theevents in the Lena gold-fields has lent importance to this revival and made this interest particularly urgent. 
 More than ever, it is now appropriate to discuss the question of theattitude of the Trudoviks, i. 
e. 
, of the peasant democrats, tothe worker democrats. 
 In an article entitled “The Trudovik Group and the Workers’ Party” ( Zaprosy Zhizni No. 
 17), Mr. 
 V. 
 Vodovozov, answering my articles—”Liberalism and Democracy” * —in Zvezda ,37 sets forth the Trudovik view on this question. 
 The controversy bears on the very essence of twopolitical trends which express the interests of nine-tenths o f Russia’s population. 
 It is therefore the duty of everydemocrat to pay the closest attention to the subject of the controversy. 
 I The standpoint of the working-class democracy is the class struggle. 
 The wage-workers constitute a definite class in modern society. 
 The position of this class is radically dif-ferent from that of the class of small proprietors, the peas-ants. 
 That is why their association in one party is out ofthe question. 
 The aim of the workers is to abolish wage slavery by elim-inating the rule of the bourgeoisie. 
 The peasants’ aim lies in democratic demands that could abolish serfdom, with all *See present edition, Vol. 
 17, pp. 
 569-77. 
— Ed. 
 its social roots and in all its manifestations, but which could not even slightly affect the rule of the bourgeoisie. 
 In Russia today, the tasks which the workers and the peasants have in common are drawing the working-classdemocracy and the peasant democracy closer together. 
While necessarily following different paths, the two democ-racies can, and for the purpose of achieving success should,act jointly against all that is contrary to democracy. 
 Unless there is such joint or common action, unless the peasant dem-ocrats get rid of the tutelage of the liberals (Cadets), anyserious democratic reforms in Russia will be out of the ques-tion. 
 Those are the views of the working-class democrats, the Marxists, which I have developed in the two articles entitled “Liberalism and Democracy”. 
 The Trudoviks, whose views are expounded by Mr. 
 Vodo-vozov, want to be a party standing “above classes”. 
 Theyare convinced that one party “could fully take care of theinterests of three classes of society”: the peasantry, the work-ing class and the “working intelligentsia”. 
 I said that this “conviction” contradicted (1) all the facts of economic science, (2) the entire experience of countrieswhich went through epochs similar to the present epoch inRussia, and (3) Russia’s experience during a particularlyimportant and crucial period of her history, the year 1905. 
I derided the truly Cadet claim to “embrace” different classes, and recalled the fact that the Cadets describe the Maklakovs as “working intelligentsia”. 
 Mr. 
 Vodovozov, without citing these arguments of mine fully and coherently, seeks to disprove them by disjointedstatements. 
 In reply to the first argument, for instance, hesays: “The peasantry is a mass of people living by their own labour, its interests are the interests of labour, and therefore it represents one contingent of the great army of labour,just as the workers represent another contingent of thatarmy. 
” This is not Marxist, but bourgeois economic science: the phrase about the interests of labour here obscures the fun-damental difference between the position of the small propri-etor and that of the wage-worker. 
 The worker owns no meansof production and sells himself, his hands, his labour-power . 
 The peasant does own means of production—imple-ments, livestock, and his own or rented land—and sells the products of his farming, being a small proprietor, a small entrepreneur, a petty bourgeois. 
 Even today in Russia peasants hire no less than two million agricultural wage-labourers to work on their farms. 
 And if all the landed estates were transferred, without com-pensation, to the peasants, the latter would employ a much greater number of labourers. 
 Such a transfer of the land to the peasants is a common interest of the entire peasantry, of all wage-workers, of alldemocrats, because landlordism is the foundation of the land-lords’ political power of the type with which Purishkevich,followed by Markov the Second and other “men of the Third Duma”—nationalists, Octobrists, etc. 
—have made Russia so very familiar. 
 This shows that the common aim now before the peasants and the workers has absolutely nothing of socialism, despitethe opinion of ignorant reactionaries, and sometimes ofliberals. 
 That aim is purely democratic. 
 Its achievement would mean the achievement of freedom for Russia, but it would not at all mean the abolition of wage slavery. 
 If we want to put the joint action of different classes on a sound basis, and if we want to ensure the real anddurable success of such action, we must be clear as to thepoints on which the interests of these classes converge and those on which they diverge. 
 All delusions and “misconcep-tions” on this score, and any obscuring of the matter withmeaningless phrases are bound to have the most ruinouseffect, are bound to undermine success. 
 II “Agricultural work is different from work in a factory; but then the work of a factory worker is different from that of a shop-assistant, yet Zvezda assiduously tries to prove to the shop-assistants that they belong to the same class as the workers, and that therefore they mustregard Social-Democrats as their representatives.... 
” That is how Mr. 
 Vodovozov tries to disprove the argu-ments regarding the profound class distinction between smallproprietors and wage-workers! In this case too, Mr. 
 Vodo-vozov’s arguments are permeated with the usual spirit of bourgeois political economy. 
 The small proprietor who is a farmer belongs to the same class as the manufacturer, or the small proprietor who is an artisan, and as the small pro-prietor who is a shopkeeper; there is no class distinctionbetween them, they are distinguished only by their occupa-tions . 
 The wage-worker in agriculture belongs to the same class as the wage -worker in a factory or in a commercial establishment. 
 These are all elementary truths in terms of Marxism. 
 And Mr. 
 Vodovozov is mistaken if he thinks that by describing“my” Marxism as “extremely oversimplified” he can con-ceal the essence of the matter , namely, that the Trudoviks are constantly slipping from Marxist to bourgeois political econ-omy. 
 Mr. 
 Vodovozov slips into the same error, and along the same lines, when, in dealing with my reference to the pro-found class distinction between small proprietors and wage-workers as proved by the experience of all countries and bythat of Russia, he tries to refute me by pointing out that sometimes one class is represented by several parties, and vice versa. 
 In Europe the workers sometimes follow theliberals, the anarchists, the clericals, etc. 
 The landlords aresometimes divided among several parties. 
 What do these facts prove? Only that, in addition to class distinctions, there are other distinctions, such as religious, national, etc. 
, that affect the formation of parties. 
 That is true, but what has it got to do with our controver-sy? Does Mr. 
 Vodovozov point to the existence in Russia ofspecific historical conditions—religious, national and other-wise—that add themselves in the present instance to the class distinctions? Mr. 
 Vodovozov did not, and could not, point to any such conditions at all. 
 Our controversy turned entirely on wheth-er it is possible to have in Russia a party “standing aboveclasses”, one “serving the interests of three classes”. 
 (Inci-dentally, it is ridiculous to call the “working intelligentsia”a class. 
) Theory gives a clear answer to this question: it is impossi-ble! An equally clear answer is provided by the experience of1905, when all the class, group, national, and other distinc-tions stood out in bold relief in the most open and most massive actions at a highly important turning-point in Rus-sian history. 
 The Marxist theory was confirmed by the ex-perience of 1905, which showed that a single party ofpeasants and workers is impossible in Russia. 
 All three Dumas have shown the same thing. 
Why refer, then, to the fact that in various countries of Europe there have been instances of one class divided into several parties or of several classes united under the leader-ship of a single party? This reference is quite beside thepoint. 
 By this reference Mr. 
 Vodovozov is merely deviating—and trying to divert the reader—from the point at issue. 
 If the Russian democracy is to attain success, it is very important for it to know its own strength, to take a sober view of the state of affairs, and to realise clearly which classes it can count upon. 
 It would be exceedingly harmful for it to cherish illusions, to cover up class distinctionswith empty phrases, or to dismiss them with good wishes. 
 We must plainly recognise the profound class distinction between the peasants and the workers of Russia, a distinc-tion which cannot be eliminated within the framework of capi-talist society, within the framework of domination by themarket. 
 We must plainly recognise the points on which theirinterests coincide at present . 
 We must unite each of these classes, cement its forces, develop its political consciousnessand define the common task of both. 
 A “radical” (to use Mr. 
 Vodovozov’s term, although I do not think it a fortunate one) peasant party is usefuland indispensable. 
 All attempts to found a party standing “above classes”, to unite the peasants and the workers in one party, to repre-sent a non-existent “working intelligentsia” as a class by itself, are extremely harmful and ruinous to the cause of Russian freedom, since such attempts can bring nothing but disillusionment, a waste of strength, and confusion inpeople’s minds. 
 While fully sympathising with the formation of a consist-ently democratic peasant party, we are obliged to combat the above-mentioned attempts. 
 The workers must also combat the influence of the liberals upon the democratic peasant-ry. 
 III Concerning the attitude of the liberals towards the bour-geois democracy, and of the Cadets towards the Trudoviks,the conference of the latter said nothing clear and definite. 
 38 The Trudoviks do not seem to realise that it was the depend-ence of the democratic peasantry upon the liberals that wasone of the principal causes of the failure of the emancipation movement in 1905-06, and that this movement cannot b e successful so long as wide and leading sections of thepeasantry are unaware of the difference between democracyand liberalism, and do not free themselves from the tute-lage and domination of the liberals. 
 Mr. 
 Vodovozov touched upon this question of cardinal importance in an extremely cursory and unsatisfactory man-ner. 
 He says that “the Cadet Party serves primarily the in-terests of the urban population”. 
 This is not true. 
 Thisdefinition of the class roots and political role of the CadetParty is utterly worthless. 
 The Cadet Party is the party of the liberal-monarchist bourgeoisie. 
 The social basis of this party (as well as of the “Progressists”) is the economically more progressive (ascompared with the Octobrists) sections of the bourgeoisie,but above all the bourgeois intelligentsia. 
 However, a sec-tion of the urban and rural petty bourgeoisie still followsthe Cadets only by tradition (i. 
e. 
, by mere habit, blind repetition of what was done yesterday), and because they are simply deceived by the liberals. 
 By calling themselves democrats, the Cadets are deceiv-ing themselves and the people. 
 Actually the Cadets arecounter-revolutionary liberals. 
 This has been fully proved by the entire history of Russia, particularly in the twentieth century, and above all in 1905-06. 
 And the publication Vekhi 39 demonstrated it, exposed it, particularly clearly and completely. 
 Nor can any “reserva-tions” of the Cadet diplomats in regard to Vekhi alter this fact. 
 The first phase of the liberation movement in Russia, the first decade of the twentieth century, revealed that the mass of the population, while gravitating towards democ-racy, is not sufficiently class-conscious, cannot distinguish between liberalism and democracy, and submits to the lead-ership of the liberals. 
 So long and insofar as there is no change in this respect, all talk of democratic reform in Rus-sia is pointless. 
 It would be just idle talk. 
 How does Mr. 
 Vodovozov counter these premises, on which I based my article? “In the present conditions,” he writes,“the Trudoviks consider it extremely tactless [!!] to say toomuch about the counter-revolutionary nature of the Ca-dets.... 
” Well, well! What has “tact” got to do with it? And why “too much”? If it is true that the Cadets are counter-revolu-tionary liberals, this truth must be told. 
 Whether we shouldsay a lot or only a little about the counter-revolutionaryRights and the counter-revolutionary liberals is not a seri-ous question at all. 
 Whenever a publicist speaks of the Rights, and whenever he speaks of the liberals, he must tellthe truth. 
 The Trudoviks told the truth about the Rights. 
We praise them for this. 
 As regards the liberals, the Trudo-viks themselves began to speak of them, but they did not speak the whole truth ! That is the only thing for which we reproach the Trudo-viks. 
 “Too much” or too little—that is quite beside the point. 
 Let the Trudoviks devote a thousand lines to the Rights andfive lines to the liberals—we shall have no objections tothat. 
 That is not the reason for our objections to the Tru-doviks. 
 What we objected to is that in those “five lines” (you must blame yourself, Mr. 
 Vodovozov, for bringing intothe controversy your unfortunate expression “too much”!)the truth about the liberals was not told. 
 Mr. 
 Vodovozov avoided answering the real question: are the Cadets counter-revolutionary or not? It is a big mistake on the part of the Trudoviks to evade this question, for that implies in fact that a section of the democrats and a section of the former Marxists are de-pendent on the liberals. 
 This question is inexorably posed by the entire history of the first decade of the twentieth century. 
 In Russia today, new democratic elements are growing up everywhere, among the most diverse sections of the popula-tion. 
 That is a fact. 
 As they grow these democratic elements must be educated in the spirit of consistent democracy. 
 Such education will be impossible unless we explain the true nature of the liberals, who have at their disposal hun-dreds of press organs and a hundred seats in the Duma, thusconstantly exerting an influence along falsely democratic lines upon an incomparably greater number of people thanwe can reach with our propaganda. 
 The democrats must rally their forces. 
 We shall always praise the Trudoviks for their democratic speeches about the Rights. 
 But theirs will be an inconsistent democracy if,when they speak of the liberals, they do so in liberal fashion , instead of using a language worthy of democrats. 
 It is not two, but three camps that are contending in the elections. 
 Do not lump the second camp (the liberals) with the third camp (the democrats), Trudovik gentlemen. 
 Do not obscure the distinction between them—the liberals aredoing “ too much ” as it is towards that objectionable end.

 POLITICAL PARTIES IN RUSSIA The Duma elections are compelling all the parties to inten-sify their agitation and rally their forces, so that they mayreturn the greatest possible number of deputies of “theirown” party. 
 In Russia, as in all other countries, the election campaign is attended by the most brazen self-advertisement. 
 All thebourgeois parties, that is, those which uphold the econom-ic privileges of the capitalists, are advertising themselvesin the same way as individual capitalists advertise theirgoods. 
 Look at the commercial advertisements in any news-paper—you will see that the capitalists think up the most “striking”, bombastic and fashionable names for their mer-chandise, which they praise in the most unrestrained man-ner, stopping at no lie or invention whatever. 
 The general public—at any rate in the big cities and trade centres—has long since become used to commercial adver-tisement and knows its worth. 
 Unfortunately, political advertisement misleads an incomparably greater number ofpeople; it is much harder to expose and its deception muchmore lasting. 
 The names of some parties, both in Europe andin Russia, are chosen with a direct eye to advertisement,and their “programmes” are quite often written for the sole purpose of hoodwinking the public. 
 The greater the degree of political liberty in a capitalist country and the moredemocracy there is, i. 
e. 
, the greater the power of the peopleand of their representatives, the more shameless, in manycases, is the self-advertisement of parties. 
 That being so, how is one to see what is what in the fight between the various parties? Does not this fight, with its fraud and advertising, indicate that representative insti-tutions, parliaments, assemblies of people’s representa-tives, are in general useless and even harmful, as rabid reac-tionaries, the enemies of parliamentarism make out? No. 
 In the absence of representative institutions there is much more deception, political lying and fraudulent trickery of allkinds, and the people have much fewer means of exposingthe deception and finding out the truth. 
 To see what is what in the fight between the parties, one must not take words at their face value but must study the actual history of the parties, must study not so much what they say about themselves as their deeds , the way in which they go about solving various political problems, and theirbehaviour in matters affecting the vital interests of the vari-ous classes of society—landlords, capitalists, peasants, work-ers, etc. 
 The greater the degree of political liberty in a country and the more stable and democratic its representative insti-tutions, the easier it is for the mass of the people to findits bearings in the fight between the parties and to learn politics , i. 
e. 
, to expose the deception and find out the truth. 
 The division of any society into different political parties is revealed most clearly of all in times of profound crises shaking the whole country. 
 For at such times governmentsare compelled to seek support among the various classes ofsociety; all phrase-mongering, all that is petty and extra-neous, is brushed aside by the gravity of the struggle; theparties strain every nerve and appeal to the masses , and the masses, guided by their unerring instinct and enlightened by the experience of an open struggle, follow the partiesthat represent the interests of a particular class. 
 The epochs of such crises always determine the party alignment of the social forces of the country concerned formany years or even decades ahead. 
 In Germany, for instance, such crises were the wars of 1866 and 1870 40; in Russia, the events of 1905. 
 We cannot understand the essence of ourpolitical parties, nor gain a clear idea as to which classes a particular party in Russia represents, unless we go backto the events of that year. 
 Let us begin our brief survey of the political parties in Russia with the parties of the extreme Right. 
 On the extreme right flank, we find the Union of the Rus-sian People. 
 The programme of this party is set forth as follows in Russkoye Znamya , the Union’s newspaper published by A. 
 I. 
 Dubrovin: “The Union of the Russian People, which on June 3, 1907, was accorded the honour of being called upon from the height of the Tsar’sthrone to be its reliable bulwark, and to serve as an example of law and order to all and in everything, proclaims that the will of the Tsar can only be exercised: (1) if the Tsar’s autocratic power, whichis indissolubly and vitally bound up with the Russian OrthodoxChurch, canonically established, manifests itself in full measure;(2) if the Russian nationality is dominant not only in the inner guber-nias, but also in the border regions; (3) if there is a Duma, composed exclusively of Russians, as the main assistant of the monarch in his work for building up the state; (4) if the principles of the Union ofthe Russian People with regard to the Jews are fully observed; and(5) if all officials who are opposed to the Tsar’s autocratic powerare removed from government service. 
” We have faithfully copied this solemn declaration of the Rights , on the one hand, so that the reader may be directly acquainted with the original and, on the other, because thefundamental motives stated in it are valid for all the parties of the majority in the Third Duma, i. 
e. 
, for the nationalists and the Octobrists as well. 
 This will be seen from what wesay further on. 
 The programme of the Union of the Russian People in effect repeats the old slogan of the days of serfdom, that is,Orthodoxy, Autocracy, Nationhood. 
 In regard to the ques-tion on which the Union is generally set apart from other kindred parties—namely, recognition or rejection of “con-stitutional” principles in the Russian political system—itis particularly important to note that the Union is by no means opposed to representative institutions in general. 
 It is evident from the programme quoted above that the Union favours a Duma that will play the part of “assistant”. 
 Moreover, the specific feature of the Russian Constitu-tion—if we may call it that—is expressed by the Dubrovin-ite correctly, i. 
e. 
, in keeping with the actual state of affairs. 
It is this stand that is taken by both the nationalistsand the Octobrists in their practical policies. 
 The controver-sy between these parties over the “Constitution” is largely a fight over words. 
 The Rights are not opposed to a Duma;they only stress with particular zeal that it must be an /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR “assistant”, without specifying its powers in any way. 
 The nationalists and the Octobrists, for their part, do not insist on any clearly specified powers of the Duma, let alone on real guarantees of its powers. 
 The Octobrist “constitu-tionalists” fully agree with the “opponents of Constitution”on the basis of the June Third Constitution. 
 The programme of the Black Hundreds is straightforward, clear and outspoken on the point of persecuting non-Rus-sians in general and the Jews in particular. 
 As always, they bring out more rudely, brazenly and incitingly whatthe other government parties more or less “bashfully” ordiplomatically keep to themselves. 
 In reality, both the nationalists and the Octobrists have a hand in the persecution of non-Russians, as is well known to anyone who is at all familiar with the activity of the Third Duma or with such press organs as Novoye Vremya , Svet, Golos Moskvy41 and the like. 
 The question is: What is the social basis of the party of the Rights? What class does it represent? What class does itserve? That party’s reversion to the slogans of serfdom, its up-holding of all that is outdated, of all that is medieval inRussian life, its complete satisfaction with the June ThirdConstitution—the landlords ’ Constitution—and its defence of the privileges of the nobility and officialdom all providea clear answer to our question. 
 The Rights are the party of the semi-feudal landlords, of the Council of the United No-bility. 
 42 Not for nothing did that Council play such a promi-nent, indeed a leading, role in the dispersal of the SecondDuma, the change of the electoral law and the coup d’état ofJune 3. 
 43 To give an idea of the economic strength of this class in Russia, it is sufficient to cite the following basic fact, proved by the data of the government statistics of landownership in 1905, published by the Ministry of the Interior. 
 Less than 30,000 landlords in European Russia own 70,000,000 dessiatines of land; the same amount of land is owned by 10,000,000 peasant households with the smallest allotments. 
 This makes an average of about 2,300 dessiatines per big landlord, and, in the case of the poor peasants, anaverage of 7 dessiatines per family, per household. 
 It is quite natural and inevitable that the peasant cannot live on such an “allotment” but can only die a slow death. 
 The recurrent famines which affect millions, such as this year’s famine, continue to dislocate peasant farming in Rus-sia following each crop failure. 
 The peasants are compelledto rent land from the landlords, paying for it by variousforms of labour service . 
 To pay for the use of the land, the peasant works for the landlord with his horse and his imple-ments. 
 This is nothing short of corvée, except that it is not officially called serfdom. 
 With 2,300 dessiatines of land attheir disposal, most of the landlords can run their estatesonly by keeping the peasants in bondage, by resorting tolabour service, that is, the corvée system. 
 They cultivateonly part of these huge estates with the help of wage-labourers. 
 Further, that same class of the landed nobility supplies the state with the overwhelming majority of all higher andmiddle-ranking civil servants. 
 The privileges of officialdomin Russia represent another side of the privileges and agrar-ian power of the landed nobility. 
 It is therefore natural thatthe Council of the United Nobility and the “Right” parties should uphold the policy of adhering to the old feudal traditions not by accident, but because it is inevitable,and not because of the “ill will” of individuals, but underthe pressure of the interests of a tremendously powerful class . 
 The old ruling class, the survivals of landlordism, who remain the ruling class as in the past, has created for itself an appropriate party—the Union of the Russian People or the “Rights” in the Duma and in the Council of State. 
 44 But, since there exist representative institutions, and since the masses have already come out openly in the politi-cal arena, as they did in our country in 1905, each partymust necessarily appeal to the people, within certain limits. 
 Now what can the Right parties appeal to the people about? Of course, they cannot speak plainly in defence of the interests of the landlords. 
 What they do speak of is preserv-ing the old traditions in general, and they spare no efforts tofoment distrust towards non-Russians, particularly towardsthe Jews, to incite the utterly ignorant, the utterly benight-ed, to pogroms, to “Yid”-baiting. 
 They seek to conceal the privileges of the nobility, the bureaucrats and the landlordswith talk about the “oppression” of Russians by non-Russians. 
 Such is the party of the “Rights”. 
 One of its members, Purishkevich, the most prominent spokesman of the Rights in the Third Duma, has worked a good deal, and successful-ly, to show the people what the Rights want, how they act, and whom they serve. 
 Purishkevich is a gifted agitator. 
 Next to the “Rights”, who have forty-six seats in the Third Duma, are the “ nationalists ” with ninety-one seats. 
 There is hardly a shade of difference between them and the Rights. 
 In fact, these are not two parties, but one party which has effected a division of “labour” in persecuting non-Russians, “Cadets” (liberals), democrats, etc. 
 One lot actsmore crudely, the other more subtly, but both are doing t he same thing. 
 Indeed, it is to the government’s advantage to have the “extreme” Rights—who are capable of any sort of scandal, riot, the murder of people like Herzenstein, Yol-los, Karavayev—standing somewhat apart, as if they were “criticising” the government from the right .... 
 The distinc-tion between the Rights and the nationalists cannot be ofany serious importance. 
 The Octobrists in the Third Duma are 131 strong, includ-ing, of course, the “Right Octobrists”. 
 Essentially there is nothing in the present policy of the Octobrists to distinguishthem from the Rights, except that the Octobrist Party servesnot only the landlords, but also the big capitalists, the con-servative merchants, and the bourgeoisie, which was so ter-rified by the awakening of the workers, and then also of the peasants, to independent political life, that it made a volte-face towards defence of the old order. 
 There are capitalists in Russia—quite a few, indeed—who treat the workers not abit better than the landlords treated the serfs of old; theylook on workers and clerks as their menials, as servants. 
Nobody is better fitted to defend this old order than the Right parties, the nationalists and the Octobrists. 
 There are also capitalists who at the Zemstvo 45 and municipal con-gresses in 1904 and 1905 demanded a “constitution”, butare quite willing to make peace on the basis of the JuneThird Constitution to oppose the workers. 
 The Octobrist Party is the chief counter-revolutionary par-ty of the landlords and the capitalists. 
 It is the leading party in the Third Duma: the 131 Octobrists with the 137 Rights andnationalists constitute a solid majority in the Third Duma. 
 The electoral law of June 3, 1907, guaranteed the land-lords and the big capitalists a majority: the landlords and electors of the first urban curia (i. 
e. 
, the big capitalist curia) have a majority in all the gubernia assemblies electing deputies to the Duma. 
 In twenty-eight gubernias the land-owners even by themselves have a majority in the electionassemblies. 
 The entire policy of the June Third Governmenthas been carried out with the aid of the Octobrist Party, and this party bears the responsibility for all the sins and crimes committed by the Third Duma. 
 In words, in their programme, the Octobrists uphold a “constitution”, and even liberties! In reality, this partysupported all the measures taken against the workers (theInsurance Bill, for example—recall the conduct of the Chairman of the Duma Committee on Labour, Baron Tiesen-hausen!), against the peasants, and against any mitigationof tyranny and lack of rights. 
 The Octobrists are just asmuch a government party as the nationalists. 
 This situationis not in the least altered by the fact that from time to time—particularly on the eve of elections!— the Octobrists deliv-er “opposition” speeches. 
 In all countries that have parlia-ments, the bourgeois parties have long been known to indulgein this playing at opposition —a harmless game as far as they are concerned, because no government takes it serious-ly, and a game which occasionally proves useful as a meansof “soothing” the voter by a show of opposition. 
 However, the greatest expert, the virtuoso, at the game of opposition is the chief opposition party in the Third Duma—the Cadets, Constitutional-“Democrats ”, the party of “peo-ple’s freedom”. 
 The very name of this party is part of the game, for in fact it is not at all a democratic party, and by no means a people’s party; it is a party, not of freedom, but of half-freedom, if not of quarter-freedom. 
 In fact, it is the party of the liberal-monarchist bourgeoi-sie, which dreads the popular movement far more thanreaction. 
 The democrat has faith in the people, in the movement of the masses, and he helps this movement in every way, although he fairly often has (as have the bourgeois demo-crats, the Trudoviks) a wrong notion about the significance of this movement within the framework of the capitalist system. 
 The democrat sincerely strives to put an end to all medievalism. 
 The liberal is afraid of the movement of the masses; he tries to check it, and deliberately defends certain institu-tions of medievalism—in fact, the most important of them—as a bulwark against the masses, particularly the workers. 
What the liberals want is by no means to destroy all the foundations of the power of the Purishkeviches, but to share power with them. 
 The democratic petty bourgeois (hence alsothe peasant and the Trudovik) says: everything for the peo-ple and through the people. 
 He sincerely-strives to uprootall the foundations of Purishkevichism, though he does notunderstand the significance of the wage-workers’ struggle against capital. 
 The real aim of the liberal-monarchist bour-geoisie, on the other hand, is to share power with Purishke-vich and rule with him over the workers and over the small proprietors. 
 In the First and the Second Dumas, the Cadets had a major-ity or occupied a leading position. 
 They used it for a sense-less and inglorious game : when facing the Right, they played at loyalty and ability to serve as ministers (as if to say thatthey could solve all the contradictions by peaceful meanswithout spoiling the muzhik or offending Purishkevich);when facing the Left, they played at democracy. 
 The resultof this game was that in the end the Cadets got a kick from the right. 
 And on the left they earned the just title of be-trayers of people’s freedom. 
 In both the First and the SecondDumas, they fought all the time not only against the working-class democrats, but against the Trudoviks as well. 
 We needonly recall the fact that the Cadets defeated the plan for local land committees proposed by the Trudoviks (in the First Duma), a plan based on the elementary requirements of democracy, on the ABC of democracy. 
 The Cadets thusupheld the supremacy of the landlords and the bureaucrats over the peasants in the land committees! In the Third Duma the Cadets have been playing at a “responsible opposition”, an opposition in the possessive case. 
 46 As such, they voted time and again for the govern-ment budgets (“democrats”!), explained to the Octobriststhat there was nothing dangerous or harmful in their plan of “compulsory” redemption payments (compulsory for the peas-ants)—remember Berezovsky the First; they sent Karaulov to deliver “pious” speeches from the rostrum, renounced the movement of the masses, appealed to the “upper strata”,and silenced the lower strata (the Cadets’ fight against the workers’ deputies over workers’ insurance), and so onand so forth. 
 The Cadets are the party of counter-revolutionary liberal-ism. 
 By their claim to the role of a “responsible opposition”, i. 
e. 
, a recognised, lawful opposition permitted to compete with the Octobrists, an opposition not to, but of the JuneThird regime—the Cadets have committed suicide as “demo-crats”. 
 The shameless Vekhi propaganda of the Cadet ideolo-gists—Struve, Izgoyev and Co. 
, smothered with kisses by Rozanov and Anthony of Volhynia—and the role of a “responsible opposition” in the Third Duma, are two sides ofthe same medal. 
 The liberal-monarchist bourgeoisie, tolerat-ed by the Purishkeviches, wants to seat itself by the sideof Purishkevich. 
 The bloc of the Cadets and the “Progressists” at the pres-ent time, for the elections to the Fourth Duma, has provided additional proof of the profoundly counter-revolutionarynature of the Cadets. 
 The Progressists do not at all claim tobe democrats, they do not say a word about fighting theentire June Third regime, and are far from so much asdreaming of “universal suffrage”. 
 They are moderate liberals who do not make a secret of their kinship with the Octo-brists. 
 The alliance of the Cadets and the Progressists shouldopen the eyes of even the blindest “yes-men of the Cadets”to the true nature of that party. 
 The democratic bourgeoisie of Russia is represented by the Narodniks of all shades, from the most Left Socialist-Revolu-tionaries to the Popular Socialists and Trudoviks. 
 They all readily mouth “socialist” phrases, but it would be impermis-sible for a class-conscious worker to be deceived as to the realmeaning of those phrases. 
 Actually there is not a grain of socialism in the “right to land”, “equalised division” ofthe land, or “socialisation of the land”. 
 This should be clear to anyone who knows that the abolition of private landown-ership, and a new, even the “fairest” possible, division ofthe land, far from affecting commodity production and the power of the market, of money and capital, leads to their expansion. 
 However, the phrases about “the labour principle” and “Narodnik socialism” express the democrat’s deep faith inthe possibility and indispensability of destroying all medie-valism in landownership and, at the same time, in the po-litical system as well (just as they express his sincere desireto achieve this). 
 Whereas the liberals (the Cadets) seek to share political power and political privileges with the Purishkeviches, the Narodniks are democrats preciselybecause they are striving, and are bound to strive at present,to abolish all the privileges of landed property and all privileges in politics. 
 The position of the great bulk of the Russian peasants is such that they cannot even dream of any compromise with the Purishkeviches (something quite possible, attainableand near and dear to the liberal). 
 That is why the democracy of the petty bourgeoisie will have roots among the massesin Russia for a fairly long time to come, whereas Stolypin’sagrarian reform, 47 an expression of the Purishkeviches’ bourgeois policy against the muzhik, has so far produced nothing durable but—the starvation of thirty millionpeasants! The millions of starving small proprietors cannot help striving for a different kind of agrarian reform, a democratic one, which cannot break out of the bounds of capitalism or abolish wage slavery, but can sweep medievalism from the face of the Russian land. 
 The Trudoviks are an extremely weak group in the Third Duma, but they represent the masses . 
 The vacillation of the Trudoviks between the Cadets and the worker democrats isan inevitable result of the class position of the small pro-prietors, and the fact that it is particularly difficult to rally, organise and enlighten them accounts for the extreme-ly indeterminate and amorphous character of the Tru-doviks as a party. 
 That is why the Trudoviks, with the aidof the stupid “otzovism” of the Left Narodniks, present thesad picture of a liquidated party. 
 The difference between the Trudoviks and our own near-Marxist liquidators is that the former are liquidators out ofweakness, while the latter are liquidators out of malice. 
 The task of the working-class democracy is to help the weak petty-bourgeois democrats, wrest them from the liberals, and rally the democratic camp against the counter-revolu-tionary Cadets and not merely against the Rights. 
 Concerning the working-class democracy, which had its group in the Third Duma, we can say but little here. 
 Everywhere in Europe, the parties of the working class took shape by casting off the influence of general democratic ideology and learning to distinguish between the struggle of the wage-workers against capital and the struggle againstfeudalism, which they did, incidentally, in order to strength-en the latter struggle, to rid it of all wavering and timidity. 
In Russia, the working-class democracy completely dis-sociated itself both from liberalism and from bourgeois democracy (Trudovikism), to the great advantage of the democratic cause in general. 
 The liquidationist trend among the working-class demo-crats ( Nasha Zarya and Zhivoye Dyelo ) shares the weakness of Trudoviks, glorifies amorphousness, longs for the statusof a “tolerated” opposition, rejects the hegemony of the workers, confines itself to words about an “open” organisa-tion (while inveighing against the organisation that is notopen), and advocates a liberal labour policy. 
 The connectionbetween this trend and the disintegration and decadenceof the period of counter-revolution is evident, and itsfalling-away from the working-class democracy is becoming obvious. 
 The class-conscious workers, who are not liquidating any-thing and are rallying their ranks in opposition to liberalinfluences, organising as a class and developing all forms oftrade union and other unity, are coming forward both asrepresentatives of wage -labour against capital and as repre-sentatives of consistent democracy against the entire old regime in Russia and against any concessions to it. 
 By way of illustration, we give below the figures relating to the strength of the various parties in the Third Duma, which we borrow from the official Duma Handbook for 1912.

 Ilyin A QUESTIONNAIR E ON THE ORGANISATIONS OF BIG CAPITA L48 The Industry and Economics Department of the Imperial Russian Technical Society sent out a questionnaire on “pub-lic organisations of the commercial and industrial class in Russian”, or rather on the organisations of big capital. 
 The results of the questionnaire are now set forth in Mr. 
 Gush-ka’s 49 book Representative Organisations of the Commercial and Industrial Class in Russia (St. 
 Petersburg, 1912). 
 Both the material contained in the book and the conclusions,which the author indicates in fairly definite terms, deserve serious attention. 
 I As a matter of fact, the questionnaire of the Technical Society dealt with the “representative” organisations ofcapitalists, which make up approximately 80 per cent of all the organisations. 
 About 15 per cent of the organisationsare cartels, trusts and syndicates, nearly 5 per cent areassociations of employers, and the rest are stock-exchangecommittees, boards of congresses, etc. 
 These latter organisa-tions are very fond of calling themselves “representative”. 
 Their job is to influence government bodies. 
 The employers’ associations, in Mr. 
 Gushka’s opinion, conduct a “direct” class struggle against the wage-workers, whereas the representative organisations conduct an “indi-rect” class struggle—a “struggle against other classes byexerting pressure on the state power and on public opinion”. 
 That terminology is wrong, of course. 
 It at once betrays one of the principal defects which Mr. 
 Gushka has in commonwith most representatives of “professorial”, bourgeois politi-cal economy. 
 On the face of it, he accepts the concept of the class struggle; on the face of it, the class struggle serves as the basis of his investigation. 
 Actually, however, that con-cept is narrowed down and distorted. 
 Indeed, from whatMr. 
 Gushka says, the struggle of the capitalists against thewage-workers within the framework of a given political systemis a “direct” class struggle, while the struggle for the poli-tical system itself is an “ indirect ” class struggle! What about the struggle for “state power” itself—where does that belong? But we shall have occasion to deal with this fundamental fault of Mr. 
 Gushka’s “world outlook” in the proper place. 
The value of his work is not in its theory, but in the summaryof facts it offers. 
 The data on organisations of the prepon-derant type are at any rate of considerable interest. 
 The total number of “representative” organisations of big capital in Russia in 1910 is given as 143. 
 Seventy-one ofthem were stock-exchange societies with their committees. 
Then came 14 committees of commerce and manufacture,three merchants’ boards, 51 organisations in the “combined”group (congresses and their boards, advisory bureaus, etc. 
), and four organisations of an indefinite type. 
 The question-naire was answered by only 62 organisations, or less thanhalf the total. 
 Out of the 51 organisations in the “com-bined” group, which is the most interesting, 22 answered thequestionnaire. 
 The data on the time the organisations were founded are characteristic. 
 Of the 32 stock-exchange committees which answered the questionnaire, 9 were founded in the last century,from 1800 to 1900, 5 in the four years 1901-04, 9 in the two years of revolution —1905-06—and 9 in the period 1907 to 1910. 
 “Here,” writes Mr. 
 Gushka, “we clearly see the effect of the impetus which the social movement of the stormy year 1905 lentthe process of the self-organisation of the representatives of capital. 
” Of the 22 organisations in the combined group, only 7 came into being during the period 1870 to 1900, 2 from 1901to 1904, 8 in the two years of revolution —1905-06—and 5 from 1907 to 1910. 
 All those “congress boards” of represent-atives of industry in general—mine owners, oil industrial-ists, and so on and so forth—are a product chiefly of theperiod of revolution and counter-revolution. 
 The organisations are divided according to industries as follows. 
 The group of stock-exchange committees is predomi-nantly mixed: these committees usually unite all the branches of industry and commerce of the area concerned. 
In the group of committees of commerce and manufacture,the textile industry is in the forefront. 
 In the main, combined,group, almost half the organisations represent not commerce,but industry—mining and metallurgy, to be specific. 
 “It is this group of industries (mining and metallurgy) that constitutes the economic basis of the organisationsof Russia’s modern industrial ‘guard’,” writes Mr. 
 Gushka,who has a slight weakness for using a “lofty style” in speak-ing of the subject of his investigation. 
 Only in the case of a part of the organisations was it pos-sible to establish the total turnover or output for the entire branch of commerce or industry to which the organisationin question belongs. 
 The total thus obtained is 1,570 millionrubles, of which 1,319 million rubles belongs to members ofthe organisations. 
 Consequently, the organised represent 84per cent of the total. 
 The turnover of 3,134 members of organisations amounted to 1,121 million rubles, or an aver-age of 358,000 rubles per member. 
 The number of workersemployed by 685 members of organisations is approximately219,000 (on p. 
 111, the author mistakenly puts it at 319,000),or an average of more than 300 workers per member. 
 It is clear that we are dealing here with organisations of big capital, or even the biggest capital, to be exact. 
 Mr. 
 Gushka is fully aware of this, for he points out, forinstance, that only the really big and biggest merchants andindustrialists are admitted as members into the stock-ex-change committees and the committees of commerce andmanufacture, and that the congresses of representatives of industry and commerce are made up of the “biggest” capi-talist undertakings. 
 That is why the author is wrong when he refers, in the title of his book, to organisations “of the commercial andindustrial class in Russia”. 
 That is incorrect. 
 Here again the author narrows down the concept of class. 
 Actually, Mr. 
 Gushka is dealing with a stratum , not with a class. 
 Sure enough, the stratum of the biggest capitalists economi-cally dominates all the other strata, which it unquestion-ably overwhelms by the size of its turnover. 
 This is beyond doubt. 
 Nevertheless, it is a stratum, and not a class. 
 Thus, for instance, there is a vast distance between the political role of the representative organisations of this stratum andits political domination, as well as between its politicaldomination and that of the commercial and industrial class. 
 In this connection, we must point out the following argument of Mr. 
 Gushka’s: “We in Russia,” he writes, “are accustomed to applying a very large scale to define what is called a big or a small undertaking, in view of the wellknown extraordinary concentration of capital in our country,surpassing the concentration of capital even in Germany.... 
” The comparison with Germany is wrong. 
 For instance, in the Urals there are very few small undertakings, if any, in the mining and metallurgical industries for reasons of an entirely distinctive nature—due to the absence of fullfreedom for industry and to the survivals of medievalism. 
And our official (or, what is the same thing, our Narodnik)distinction between factory and “handicraft” industries—does it not make our industrial statistics incomparable with the German statistics? Does it not very often mislead the observer by speaking of “extraordinary concentration” inRussia and obscuring the “extraordinarily” scattered charac-ter of the countless small peasant undertakings? II It is interesting to note some of the data provided by the questionnaire on the activity of the representative organisa-tions of the biggest capital. 
 For instance, the author gives asummary of the information about their budgets. 
 The bud-gets of the 22 organisations in the combined group show a total income of 3,950,000 rubles, and the total income of allthe organisations is 7. 
25 million rubles. 
 “This annual budgetof our 56 organisations,” writes Mr. 
 Gushka, “amounting to7. 
25 million rubles, would probably be 50 or 100 per centhigher if the financial reports of the other organisations, those not covered by our questionnaire, were included. 
” However, more than a half of this budget, namely, 4. 
5 million rubles, is spent on business and on charity. 
 On purely representational functions, the 56 organisations spend 2. 
7 million rubles. 
 “Most of the answers or financial reports put at the head of this expenditure on representation the salaries of the personnel, then the renting of premises. 
 In64. 
4 per cent of the organisations, the greatest part of theexpenditure goes for maintenance of personnel, and in 26. 
7per cent of them it goes for premises. 
” These figures, in view of the turnover of 1,319 million rubles in the capitalist associations covered by the investi-gation, show that the expenditure is very modest, so thatMr. 
 Gushka’s pompous conclusion that the budget of expend-iture is an “ index of the financial might [author’s italics] of the representative organisations of the commercial andindustrial bourgeoisie in Russia” again betrays his inordi-nate fondness for big words. 
 The author devotes Chapter IX of his book to the “third element”, i. 
e. 
, the intelligentsia in the service of the capi-talist associations. 
 It appears that 29 stock-exchange com-mittees listed 77 representatives of the third element astheir employees; the 22 organisations in the combined group listed 180 such employees. 
 Most of the answers speak of 2 to 4 representatives of the third element per organisation. 
Since capitalist associations often understate this kind ofdata, the author thinks it probable that “the representativeorganisations of capital have in their service, holding keyposts, a host [!!] of intellectuals numbering at least a thou-sand persons ”—secretaries, accountants, statisticians, legal advisers, etc. 
 Really, it does not take much to set Mr. 
 Gushka talking about a “host”. 
 The publishing activity of the capitalist associations is characterised by the following figures. 
 In addition to the answers to the questionnaire, there accumulated a small library of 288 volumes—the proceedings of congresses, re-ports, statutes and memoranda—which have never been onsale. 
 Nine organisations publish periodicals: Mining and Smelting , Oil, Industry and Commerce , Bulletin of the Rus-sian Association of Distillery Owners , etc. 
 The author gives the total number of issues of these publications as 2,624“volumes”, to which he adds 452 volumes of “proceedings”, annual reports, etc. 
, as well as 333 volumes of non-periodical publications. 
 Mr. 
 Gushka puts the total at 3,409 “volumes”, which he describes as “impressive”. 
 The total number of publications probably amounts to 4,000-5,000 volumes. 
 “It may be said without exaggeration that a veritable treasure lies buried in that library,” exclaims Mr. 
 Gushka, “a wealth ofmaterial for the study of the anatomy and physiology, if we maysay so, of the big bourgeoisie in Russia .... 
 U nless we study this valua-ble material, we cannot form a proper idea of the balance of the domi-nant social forces in Russia, and more particularly of the social nature and role of Russian state power both before and after 1905. 
” Mr. 
 Gushka makes very frequent excursions of this kind into the sphere of the social nature and role of Russianstate power. 
 They merit special consideration because of the importance of the question, and because it is misrepre-sented by the author, who exaggerates things beyond measureand for that very reason vows in passing that he speaks“without exaggeration”. 
 III “The centre of gravity of the activity of the organisations under survey,” writes Mr. 
 Gushka, “as representative organisations, i. 
e. 
,organisations devoted to representing the interests of the industrialand commercial class, is naturally in the sphere of formulating the position of the representatives of this class on various questions con-cerning its interests, and of defending this position by various means. 
” Undoubtedly, that is exactly where the “centre of gravity” lies. 
 The questionnaire allots much space to questions aboutthe items discussed by the organisations of the capitalistsand to the petitions they filed. 
 In summarising the informa-tion obtained, the author singles out a long list of what, in his opinion, are “questions of a general nature”. 
 The most important questions are grouped as follows: (a) work-ers’ insurance, public holidays, etc. 
; (b) income tax, taxeson enterprises, etc. 
; (c) tariff policy; (d) transport; (e) joint-stock companies, credit, etc. 
; (f) consulates abroad, statis-tics, the organisation of a mining department; (g) participa-tion of the merchant class in the Zemstvo institutions, in the Council of State, in the preliminary discussion of govern-ment Bills, etc. 
 In this connection, Mr. 
 Gushka draws the following conclusion: “In any event, as may be gathered from the enumerated groups of questions and petitions, our organisa-tions have a very wide sphere of activity .... 
” On reading such a conclusion, one cannot help stopping to see whetherby any chance the word not has been omitted. 
 For it is obvious that the sphere of activity indicated by the authoris not wide at all. 
 But it is certainly not a slip of the pen we have here; the trouble comes from the essential “pattern” of the author’s mentality. 
 “It would be difficult to name anymore or less important field of the social and political lifeof the country that is outside the sphere of activity of therepresentative organisations of capital,” he maintains. 
 Incredible, but true: Mr. 
 Gushka in all seriousness presents us with this flagrant untruth, which he repeats in a dozen different ways! “It would be difficult to name .... 
” What about the elec-toral law? Or the agrarian question? Is it possible that theseare not “important fields of the social and political life ofthe country”? Mr. 
 Gushka looks at “social and political life” from the narrow peep-hole of a merchant ’s standpoint. 
 He cannot for the life of him understand that his absolute statementstestify to narrowness, and certainly not to breadth. 
 Thequestions raised by the merchants are narrow because theyconcern only the merchants. 
 The capitalists do not rise to questions of general political importance. 
 “Admission of representatives of industry and commerce” into local orcentral institutions of one sort or another is the limit ofthe “courage” they show in their petitions. 
 As to how theseinstitutions are to be organised in general , that is something they are unable to think of. 
 They accept the institutions which have taken shape at someone else’s bidding, and beg for a place in them. 
 They slavishly accept the politicalbasis created by some other class, and on this basis “peti-tion” for the interests of their social-estate, their group, their stratum, unable even in this sphere to rise to a broad under-standing of the interests of the whole of their class . 
 Mr. 
 Gushka, who glaringly distorts the facts, slips into a tone of sheer praise. 
 “The energetic and insistent pressurebrought to bear upon government bodies,” he writes. 
 “Our organisations” “perfectly [!!] understand this themselves. 
” ... “The organisations of big capital have developed into a regular lobby which actually exerts perhaps a greater in-fluence upon legislation than the Duma, the more so”—theauthor tries to be witty—“as Article 87 50 does not apply to the capitalist parliament, and the organisations of capital havenever been purposely dissolved for three days. 
”... This witticism is an obvious indication of the boundless conceited narrow-mindedness of the big-wigs of industry and of their eulogist, Gushka. 
 A minor detail, a mere trifle,has been overlooked: the Duma raises questions concerningthe entire state administration and all classes, being aninstitution of the whole state, while the organisations of themerchant big-wigs consider it courageous to raise questions con-cerning only the merchants, only the rights of the merchants. 
 Mr. 
 Gushka goes to the length of quoting the statement, made by the Ufa Stock-Exchange Committee in its reportfor 1905-06, that “the government itself, by a series offundamental measures to reform the stock-exchange institu-tions, is selecting ... worthy assistants for itself ”, and he calls this statement “correct”, puts the last phrase in italics, and speaks of “real and active co-operation with the government”. 
 On reading such stuff one cannot help thinking of the German word Lobhudelei —grovelling adulation, or adula-tory grovelling. 
 To speak with a smug countenance—in1905-06—of “fundamental measures to reform—the stock-exchange institutions”! Why, this is the viewpoint of a flunkey whom the master has permitted to “consult” withthe cook about arrangements for dinner, etc. 
, calling thetwo of them his “worthy assistants”. 
 How close Mr. 
 Gushka is to this point of view can be seen from that subsection of Chapter XV dealing with the results of the petitions of the organisations, which he has entitled “Losing Positions”. 
 “It cannot be denied,” we read there,“that there are several fields in which the petitions and demands of the representatives of capital do come up againstgovernment resistance. 
” Then follow examples in this se-quence: (1) state-owned forests—the state is itself engaged in the timber industry; (2) railway tariffs—the railways are run by the state itself; (3) the question of representation inthe Zemstvos; and (4) the question of representation in the Duma and in the Council of State. 
 “In both cases,” says the author, referring to the last two questions, “the effect of the close ties between the bureaucracy and the other ruling class—the big landowners—makes itself felt, of course. 
” “But if we leave out the few above-mentioned questions,” con-tinues the happy Mr. 
 Gushka, “then it must be admitted that in all the other fields ... the data furnished by our questionnaire show the position of the commercial and industrial class to be a winning one. 
” Is this not a real gem? The losing position is the timber business, railways, the Zemstvos and parliament. 
 But “if we leave out the few above-mentioned questions”, we shall have a winning position! And in the “conclusion” of his book, where he takes up the cudgels against the “traditional prejudice” about thelowliness and lack of rights of the commercial and indus-trial class, Mr. 
 Gushka rises to what may be called pathetic Lobhudelei : “It is not as a lowly class lacking rights that the commercial and industrial bourgeoisie sits at the table of Russian statehood, but as a welcome guest and collaborator, as a ‘worthy assistant’ ofthe state power, occupying a prominent place both by establishedcustom and by law, by recorded right. 
 Nor is it since yesterday thatit has occupied this place. 
” This would fit perfectly into an official speech delivered by a Krestovnikov, an Avdakov, a Tiesenhausen or their likeat a dinner given by a Minister. 
 It is this kind of speeches,written exactly in this kind of language, that are familiar to every Russian. 
 The only question that arises is: how are we to describe a “scientist” who, while laying claim toa “scientific” analysis of a serious questionnaire, introducesinto his writings the after-dinner speeches of servile mer-chants as “the conclusion to be drawn from the questionnaire”? “We have inherited from the ‘good old times’,” continues Mr. 
 Gushka, “a view which has acquired the stability of a prejudice,namely, that capitalist Russia is characterised by the contradictionthat the big bourgeoisie, while dominating economically , remains enslaved politically . 
 The whole of the evidence supplied by our ques-tionnaire deals a telling blow at this traditional notion. 
” It requires unbounded vulgarisation of Marxism, whose terminology Mr. 
 Gushka makes a show of using, to regard a questionnaire on the organisations of capitalists as capable the bourgeoisie by the autocracy and the landlords. 
 The author hardly touches on the material which supplies the real answer to this question, nor could he have touched on it so long as he kept within the limits of the questionnaire. 
 The questionnaire, which touches on one aspect of the life of our bourgeoisie, confirms , in fact, that the latter is politically enslaved. 
 It shows that the bourgeoisie ismaking economic progress, that certain particular rights of the bourgeoisie are being extended, that it is becoming ever more organised as a class and is playing an increasingrole in political life. 
 But the very fact that these changesare taking place makes still more profound the contradiction between the retention of 0. 
99 of the political power by theautocracy and the landlords, on the one hand, and the grow-ing economic might of the bourgeoisie, on the other. 
 Mr. 
 Gushka, who makes a show of using Marxist terminol-ogy, actually shares the standpoint of an ordinary social-liberal. 
 It is one of Russia’s specific features, or maladies ifyou will, that this liberalism is embellished with Marxistphrases. 
 Adopting the standpoint of liberalism, Mr. 
 Gushka came up against the question of the social nature of the state power in Russia. 
 But he did not appreciate, even approxi-mately, the vast scope and significance of this question. 
 The class nature of the state power in Russia has under-gone a serious change since 1905. 
 That change has been ina bourgeois direction. 
 The Third Duma, Vekhi liberalism, and a number of other signs are evidence of a new “step in the transformation” of our old state power “into a bour-geois monarchy”. 
 But while taking one more step along thisnew path, it remains the old power , and this only goes to increase the sum total of political contradictions. 
 Mr. 
Gushka, who came up against a serious question, revealed his inability to deal with it. 
 IV In analysing the material of a rather special questionnaire, Mr. 
 Gushka touched on another highly important question of principle, which is worth dwelling on specially. 
 It is thequestion of “The Role of 1905”, as the title of a subsection Question 41 of the questionnaire, referring to the number of meetings of the executive body of each organisation during each of the past five years, was intended to ascertain the extent to which the activities of the organisationsincreased in 1905. 
 The material provided by the answers tothe questionnaire “has not”—to quote Mr. 
 Gushka—“re-vealed any such phenomenon in the life of our organisations”,that is, any appreciable increase in activity. 
 “And that is understandable,” Mr. 
 Gushka comments. 
 Well, how does he explain this phenomenon?The “employers’” associations, he argues, were bound to have increased their activity in 1905, in view of the in-creased strike movement. 
 “The organisations of a purely representative type, however,” continues Mr. 
 Gushka, “were, to a certain extent, in an entirely different position: their chief contractor, the government, was on thedefensive throughout 1905; it had very little faith in itself and in-spired hardly any confidence in others. 
 In that ‘crazy’ year, ‘whenthe authorities withdrew’, it seemed to all, including the industrialists(particularly at the end of the year), that the old ‘authorities’ would never come back. 
 “That is why the representative organisations of capital had no reason in those days for intensifying their activity as representativebodies in dealing with the government authorities. 
” This explanation won’t hold water. 
 If the “authorities” had really “withdrawn”, the withdrawal of the old politi-cal authorities would inevitably have resulted in the new economic authorities increasing their activity and becomingnew political authorities. 
 If the government was mainly onthe defensive, how could the “collaborator and worthy assist-ant” of that government (as Mr. 
 Gushka describes thecommercial and industrial bourgeoisie) help increasing its activity to defend that government and itself? Our author has not at all thought out what he was saying. 
 He confineshimself to a mere collection of words—the most currentand customary ones. 
 Perhaps he feels that the question atissue is an extremely important one on the answer to whichdepends, or with the answer to which is closely linked, the answer to the more general question of the political role of the bourgeoisie, and he shrank from tackling an importantquestion in earnest—fled from it, as it were. 
 Reflect on the following statement of the author on the same point—about the role of 1905: “Neither did the organisations of capital feel inclined to meet often in order to formulate their attitude towards the social and political problems that preoccupied the whole country at the time. 
Pushed into the background by the sweeping tide of the popularmovement, they preferred to bide their time, to wait for the resultsof the struggle seething around them. 
 Towards the end, when the‘authorities’ unmistakably revealed their inclination to ‘come back’, the organisations of the commercial and industrial class likewise began gradually to resume their representative activity in its usualform and degree of intensity. 
” “The organisations of capital” were “pushed into the back-ground by the sweeping tide of the popular movement”. 
 Very well! Only, Mr. 
 Gushka is again giving no thought towhat he is saying. 
 Against whom was the sweeping tide ofthe popular movement directed? Against the old regime. 
How then was it possible for the “collaborator and worthyassistant” of that regime to be pushed into the back ground? If it really were a collaborator and worthy assistant, then the greater its economic strength, which was independent ofthe old organisation of political power, the more vigorouslyit should have pushed into the foreground. 
 How was it possible for the “collaborator and worthy as-sistant” of the old regime to find itself in a position where it “preferred to bide its time”? Mr. 
 Gushka set out to battle against the theory of the political enslavement of the economically dominating bour-geoisie, and got into a muddle the moment he tackled thejob! Contrary to his view, the “theory” which he promisedto demolish is reinforced by the course of events in 1905. 
 Both big commercial and industrial capital and the Rus-sian bourgeois liberals, far from “biding their time” in1905, took up a very definite counter-revolutionary position. 
The facts testifying to this are too well known. 
 But there isno doubt that, compared with the forces of absolutism andthe landlord class, the very big capital was to a certain extent “ pushed into the background ”. 
 But how could it happen that in a bourgeois revolution the peak of “the sweeping tide of the popular movement”pushed the bourgeoisie into the background more than anyother class? It happened because only by completely distorting the concept of “bourgeois revolution” can one arrive at the view that the latter declines when the bourgeoisie recoils from it. 
 It was bound to happen, because the chief drivingforce of the bourgeois revolution in Russia is the proletariatand the peasantry, with the bourgeoisie vacillating. 
 Beingpolitically enslaved by the landlords and absolutism, thebourgeoisie, on the other hand, takes a counter-revolu-tionary stand when the working-class movement grows in intensity. 
 Hence its vacillations and its retreat into the“background”. 
 It is both against and for the old order. 
It is willing to help the old regime against the workers,but it is perfectly capable of “establishing” itself, and evenof strengthening and expanding its domination without any landlords and without any remnants of the old political regime. 
 This is clearly shown by the experience of Americaand other countries. 
 It is easy to understand, therefore, why the peak of “the sweeping tide of the popular movement” and the greatestweakening of the old regime can cause the commercial and industrial bourgeoisie to retreat hurriedly into the “back-ground”. 
 This bourgeoisie is precisely the class which can beneutralised in the struggle between the new and the old,between democracy and medievalism; for, while it feelsmore at home, at ease and comfortable by the side of the old,this class can also exercise its rule in the event of the most complete victory of the new. 
 V In speaking of the questionnaire of the Imperial Russian Technical Society, we cannot pass over in silence an article by Mr. 
 A. 
 Yermansky in Nos. 
 1-2 and 3 of the liquidationist Nasha Zarya . 
 Mr. 
 Yermansky gives a most detailed account of Mr. 
 Gushka’s book, but not once does he indicate that hedisagrees with him! As if a man who considers himself aMarxist could identify himself with the wishy-washy liberal-ism of a praiser of the commercial and industrial big-wigs! Mr. 
 Yermansky goes even further than Mr. 
 Gushka in the direction of social-liberalism à la Brentano and Sombart, 51 slightly touched up to look like Marxism. 
 “The organisations of the representative type,” writes Mr. 
 Yermansky, “are organisations of class struggle in its full scope and on a national (partly even international) scale. 
 The material provided by the questionnaire produces apicture of a practically boundless range of questions dis-cussed by the organisations. 
 The activity of our organi-sations extends to almost all problems of state importance,as was justly stated by the Yekaterinoslav Stock-Exchange Committee. 
” That is how Mr. 
 Yermansky talks in a magazine that claims to be Marxist! This talk is blatantly false frombeginning to end. 
 It substitutes the liberal concept of class struggle for that of the class struggle in the Marxian sense. 
It proclaims as being of national and state importance thevery thing which lacks the main feature of what concerns the whole nation and the whole state: the organisation of state power and the entire sphere of “state” administration,state policy, etc. 
 See the lengths to which Mr. 
 Yermansky goes in his misguided zeal. 
 In disputing the view that “the capitalistbourgeoisie in Russia” (he means the big commercial and industrial bourgeoisie) is flabby, underdeveloped, and so on, he seeks a “contemporary formula” that would express“the actual position of the big bourgeoisie in Russia ”. 
 And what happens? It turns out that Mr. 
 Yermansky sees this formula in the words uttered by Avdakov in theBoard of Mining during a debate (mark this!) on the adop-tion of a new organisation of mining congresses with an elected chairman . 
 The practice (in Russia) has been such, said Avdakov, “that so far no one has ever hampered usin anything”. 
 “That,” writes Mr. 
 Yermansky, “is a formula which fits contem-porary conditions to a T. 
” We should think so! As far as the organisation of mining congresses is concerned, no one has hampered the dull-wit-ted merchants who are submissively bearing the yoke of thepolitical privileges of the landlords! Instead of ridiculing thebombastic Kit Kitych 52 Avdakov, Mr. 
 Yermansky strains every nerve in his zeal to assure people that Avdakov is not a Kit Kitych, that he has given a “contemporaryformula” which expresses “the actual position of the big bourgeoisie in Russia”! As for Kit Kitych Avdakov, he is the perfect image of a portly butler who never dared even to think of becoming full master in place of his lord and who is touched by the fact that his lord permits him to conferin the servants’ hall with the chambermaid, the cook, etc. 
 The following tirade in Mr. 
 Yermansky’s article shows that it is this difference between the status of the butlerand the master that he refuses to understand: “Here again,” he writes, “it will not be superfluous to make one comparison. 
 Everybody remembers how emphatically and with how much publicity, so to speak, the aspirations of the Zemstvo members‘to take part in the affairs of internal administration’ were describedas ‘absurd dreams’. 
 On the other hand, the St. 
 Petersburg Stock-Exchange Committee, which declared, as early as the pre-constitu-tion period, that it was necessary ‘to extend as far as possible the right of the stock-exchange societies [note this!] to take part in admin-istrative affairs’, was fully justified in adding: ‘Such a right of thestock-exchange societies would not constitute any innovation, forthe stock-exchange societies already enjoy it in part. 
’ That was‘an absurd dream’ in the case of others, was no dream, but reality,an element of a real constitution, in the case of the representatives of big capital. 
” “Was”, but not quite, Mr. 
 Yermansky! Your “compari-son” betrays your inability or unwillingness to distinguishbetween the aspiration (of the landlord class) to become full master itself and the aspiration (of the village elder who hasgrown rich) to consult with the master’s other servants . 
 here is a world of difference between the two. 
 It is only natural that Mr. 
 Yermansky should arrive at conclusions entirely in the spirit of Larin. 
 The representa-tives of big capital in Russia, says Mr. 
 Yermansky, “longago won the position of a ruling class in the full sense ofthe term”. 
 This is false from beginning to end. 
 Mr. 
 Yermansky has forgotten both the autocracy and the fact that power and revenues are still in the hands of the feudal landlords. 
He is wrong in thinking that “ only in the late nineteenth and the early twentieth century” did our autocracy “ceaseto be exclusively feudal”. 
 This “exclusiveness” no longer existed as far back as the epoch of Alexander II, compared with the epoch of Nicholas I. 
 But it is absolutely impermis-sible to confuse a feudal regime which is shedding the quali-ties that make it exclusively feudal, and which is taking steps towards a bourgeois monarchy, with “the complete domination of the representatives of big capital”. 
 VI The editors of Nasha Zarya , as usual, added a little “reservation” to Mr. 
 Yermansky’s article, saying that the au-thor “underestimates the importance which direct partici-pation in the exercise of political power has for it” (the bigbourgeoisie). 
 The method of making little reservations has firmly established itself among the liquidators. 
 In a series ofarticles, Yermansky expounds in great detail views on the class struggle that are inspired by liberalism. 
 What the magazine preaches is liberalism. 
 As for the “reminiscencesof the glorious days” of Marxism, they are squeezed into twolines of a footnote! The readers of Nasha Zarya are being brought up in the spirit of liberalism, which is substitutedfor Marxism, and the editors wash their hands of it—by a little reservation, in just the same way as in the Cadet Rech . 
 53 The point is not only that Mr. 
 Yermansky “underesti-mates” a certain aspect of the issue. 
 The point is that hisview on the class struggle is wrong from beginning to end. 
The point is that he makes a fundamental mistake in apprais-ing the social organisation of the autocracy. 
 We pointed out long ago, and shall not cease to point out, that this question cannot be evaded by ridiculing “the answers of 1908” (or 1912), etc. 
 This question cannot be evaded in any political writing that is at all serious. 
 The difference of opinion between Yermansky and Larin, on the one hand, and the editors of Nasha Zarya , on the other, is a difference between frank and, in their own way,honest liquidators and the diplomats of liquidationism. 
 Weshould have no illusions on this score. 
 Larin wrote that the state power in our country has already become bourgeois. 
 Therefore the workers must organise, not in expectation of a revolution (and not “for revolution”, he added), but for taking part in the constitutional renova-tion of the country. 
 Yermansky, who approaches the question from a different angle, repeats in substance Larin’s first premise; but he only hints at the conclusions, without stating them plainly. 
 Martov “corrected” Larin in the same way as the editors of Nasha Zarya are correcting Yermansky, saying that the state power is not bourgeois as yet, and it will be “enough”for the workers to seize on the contradiction between consti-tutionalism and absolutism. 
 Thus the result is agreement between Martov (plus the editors of Nasha Zarya ) and Larin-Yermansky as regards the conclusions, which is quite natural considering theiragreement on the fundamental premises of the liberal viewon labour policy. 
 We, however, still believe this view to be fundamentally wrong. 
 The point is not whether Yermansky “underesti-mates” or Martov “overestimates” the “leftward trend” ofthe Guchkovs, Ryabushinskys and Co. 
 It is not whetherYermansky “underestimates” or Martov “overestimates” the“importance which direct participation in the exercise ofpolitical power has for the bourgeoisie ”. 
 The point is that both of them not only “underestimate”, but simply do not appreciate the importance which “direct participation in the exercise of political power” has for the working class , and for the bourgeois democracy that is following its lead and isfree from the present-day waverings of the liberals! Both ofthem have in mind only one “political power” and forget about the other . 
 Both of them are looking up to the top and do not see the lower ranks. 
 But if a dozen Ryabushinskys and a hundredMilyukovs are grumbling and giving vent to liberal indigna-tion, that means that tens of millions of petty bourgeois and of “small folk” in all walks of life feel that their condition is unbearable. 
 And these millions, too, are a potential source of “political power”. 
 Only the rallying of such democrat-ic elements against the Rights and regardless of the vacilla-tion of the liberals can “solve” the problems with whichhistory has confronted Russia since the beginning of thetwentieth century.

 Ilyin THE ESSENCE OF “THE AGRARIAN PROBLEM IN RUSSIA ” An “agrarian problem”—to use this common and accepted term—exists in all capitalist countries. 
 In Russia, however,there exists, alongside the general capitalist agrarian prob-lem, another , “truly Russian” agrarian problem. 
 As a brief indication of the difference between the two agrarian prob-lems, we may point out that no civilised capitalist countryhas any widespread democratic movement of small landown-ers for the transfer of big landed estates into their hands. 
 In Russia there is such a movement. 
 Accordingly, in no European country, except Russia, do the Marxists put forward or support the demand for the transfer of the landto the small landowners. 
 An inevitable effect of the agrarianproblem in Russia is that all Marxists recognise this demand, despite disagreements over the manner in which tenure and disposal of the transferred land should be organised (divi-sion, municipalisation, nationalisation). 
 Why the difference between “Europe” and Russia? Is it due to the distinctive character of Russia’s development,to the absence of capitalism in Russia, or to the specialhopelessness and irremediability of our capitalism? Thatis what the Narodniks of various shades think. 
 But this view is radically wrong, and events disproved it long ago. 
 The difference between “Europe” and Russia stems from Russia’s extreme backwardness. 
 In the West, the bourgeoisagrarian system is fully established, feudalism was sweptaway long ago, and its survivals are negligible and play noserious role. 
 The predominant type of social relationship in Western agriculture is that between the wage-labourer and the employer, the farmer or landowner. 
 The small cul-tivators occupy an intermediary position, some of them passing into the class of those who hire themselves out, who sell their labour-power (the numerous forms of the peasant’s so-called auxiliary work or subsidiary earnings), while others pass into the class of those who hire (the number oflabourers hired by small cultivators is much greater than isgenerally believed). 
 Undoubtedly, a system of agriculture just as capitalist has already become firmly established and is steadily devel-oping in Russia. 
 It is in this direction that both landlord and peasant farming is developing. 
 But purely capitalistrelations in our country are still overshadowed to a tremen-dous extent by feudal relations. 
 The distinctive character of the Russian agrarian problem lies in the struggle which themass of the population, above all of the peasantry as a whole, are waging against these relations. 
 In the West this kind of “problem” existed everywhere in olden days, but it wassolved there long ago. 
 In Russia, its solution has been delayed—the problem was not solved by the agrarian “Reform”of 1861, nor can it be solved under present conditions by the Stolypin agrarian policy. 
 In the article “Landownership in European Russia” (Nevskaya Zvezda 54 No. 
 3), * we cited the main data reveal-ing the nature of the agrarian problem in present-dayRussia. 
 About 70 million dessiatines of land owned by 30,000 of the biggest landlords, and about as much owned by 10 million peasant households—such is the main background of the picture. 
 What are the economic relations to which thispicture testifies? The 30,000 big landlords represent chiefly the old landed nobility and the old feudal economy. 
 Of the 27,833 ownersof estates exceeding 500 dessiatines each, 18,102, or nearly two-thirds , are members of the nobility. 
 The huge latifundia in their possession—each of these big landlords owns anaverage of more then 2,000 dessiatines!—cannot be cultivat-ed with the implements, livestock and hired labour at thedisposal of the owners. 
 That being so, the old corvée systemis largely inevitable, and this means small-scale cultivation, small-scale farming, on the big latifundia, the cultivation *See pp. 
 32-35 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 of the landlords’ land with the implements and livestock of the small peasants. 
 This corvée system is especially widespread, as we know, in the central, traditionally Russian, gubernias of EuropeanRussia, in the heart of our agriculture. 
 So-called labour rent is nothing but a direct continuation and survival of thecorvée system. 
 The farming methods based on impossibleterms of bondage, such as winter hiring, 55 work for the cut-off land,56 “composite labour service”,57 and so on and so forth, are also part of the corvée system. 
 Under this systemof farming, the peasant “allotment” is a means of supplyingthe landlord with farm hands, and not only with farm hands but also with implements and livestock, which, wretchedthough they are, serve to cultivate the landlords’ land. 
 Dire poverty of the mass of the peasantry, who are tied to their allotments but cannot subsist on them, extremelyprimitive agricultural techniques, and the extreme inade-quacy of the home market for industry—such are the resultsof this state of affairs. 
 And the present famine affecting 30million peasants is the most striking proof that at bottom, in substance, this state of affairs has remained unchanged to this day. 
 Only the serf-like downtroddenness, distress andhelplessness of the mass of small proprietors in bondage can lead to such frightful mass starvation in an epoch of rapidlydeveloping agricultural techniques, which have alreadyachieved a relatively high standard (on the best capitalist farms). 
 The fundamental contradiction leading to such terrible calamities, which have been unknown to the peasants ofWestern Europe since the Middle Ages, is the contradictionbetween capitalism, which is highly developed in our indus-try and considerably developed in our agriculture, and the system of landownership , which remains medieval, feudal. 
 There is no way out of this situation unless the old systemof landownership is radically broken up. 
 Not only the landed property of the landlords, but that of the peasants as well is based on feudal relations. 
 Inthe case of the former, this is so obvious as to arouse no doubts. 
 We need only note that the abolition of the feudal latifundia, say, of those exceeding 500 dessiatines, will notundermine large-scale production in agriculture but will, indeed, increase and develop it. 
 For the feudal latifundia are bulwarks of small-scale farming based on bondage, and not of large-scale production. 
 In most regions of Russia it is practically impossible or, at all events, exceedingly difficultto run large farms taking up as much as 500 or more dessia-tines of land with the implements and livestock of theowner and with wage-labour. 
 A reduction in the size of such estates is one of the conditions for small-scale farming on terms of bondage going out of existence and for agriculture passing to large-scale capitalist production. 
 On the other hand, the allotment form of peasant land tenure in Russia also retains medieval, feudal features. 
And it is not only a question of the juridical form, which isnow being changed, in sergeant-major fashion, through the destruction of the village commune and the introduction of private land ownership; it is also a question of the actual nature of this ownership, which is unaffected by any break-up of the commune. 
 The actual condition of the vast mass of peasants holding small and dwarf “parcels” ( =tiny plots of land), consisting mostly of several narrow strips far removed from each other and distinguished by soil of the poorest quality (dueto the delimitation of the peasant land in 1861 under thesupervision of the feudal landlords, and due to the ex-haustion of the land), inevitably places them in a relationof bondage to the hereditary owner of the latifundium, the old “master”. 
 Just keep clearly in mind the following picture: as against 30,000 owners of latifundia of 2,000 dessiatines each, thereare 10,000,000 peasant households with 7 dessiatines of landper “average” household. 
 It is obvious that no matter whatdestruction of the village commune and creation of private landownership takes place, this will still not be able to change the bondage, labour rent, corvée, feudal poverty,and feudal forms of dependence, stemming from this stateof affairs. 
 The “agrarian problem” resulting from such a situation is the problem of doing away with the survivals of serfdom, which have become an intolerable obstacle to Russia’s capi-talist development. 
 The agrarian problem in Russia is oneof radically breaking up the old, medieval forms of land-ownership, both that of the landlords and that of the allot-ment peasants—a break-up which has become absolutely indispensable in view of the extreme backwardness of this landownership, in view of the extreme disharmony betweenit and the whole system of the national economy, whichhas become capitalist. 
 It must be a radical break-up, because the disharmony is too great, the old is too old, and “the disease too neglected”. 
 In any event and in all its forms, this break-up is bound to be bourgeois in content, since Russia’s entire economic lifeis already bourgeois, and the system of landownership iscertain to become subordinate to it, to adapt itself to thedictates of the market, to the pressure of capital, which isomnipotent in our society today. 
 But while the break-up cannot fail to be radical and bourgeois, there is still this question to be answered: which of the two classes directly concerned, the landlords or thepeasants, will carry out this change or direct it, determineits forms? Our next article, “A Comparison of the Stolypinand the Narodnik Agrarian Programmes”, * will deal with this “unsolved problem”.

 SOME CONCLUSIONS TO BE DRAWN THE PRE-ELECTION MOBILISATION Almost all the political forces taking part in the elections to the Duma are by now finally organised. 
 At any rate, the main party alignments have taken such definite shape that there can be no question of any serious and material changes. 
 The government began the election campaign long ago. 
 The Rights, the nationalists, and the Octobrists are “atwork” with the obvious assistance of the authorities. 
 Rech recently published, and many newspapers have reprinted, the circular sent by the governors to the police chiefs about the adoption of “measures” to prevent “Left” candidatesfrom being elected as delegates (particularly from the peas-ants) or electors. 
 This circular lifts the veil somewhat fromthe “election” machinery of the Ministry of the Interior. 
Everything possible—and impossible—will undoubtedly be done in this quarter against the opposition. 
 Not for nothing did Premier Kokovtsov, in his speech to the Moscow mer-chants, lay so much stress on the perniciousness of “opposi-tion for the sake of opposition”. 
 But while there can be no doubt about the zeal of the gov-ernment and the police in the elections, it is just as undoubt-ed that a widespread “leftward” swing has taken, or is tak-ing, place in the sentiments of the voters. 
 No stratagems ofthe government can alter this fact. 
 On the contrary, all thatstratagems and “measures” can accomplish is to increase dis-content. 
 And it is easy to understand that while this discon-tent among the big bourgeoisie is expressed by Shubinsky’s “opposition” speech, by Ryabushinsky’s “cautious” allusion to the desirability of “cultured methods of administration”,or by caustic digs at the Ministry on the part of the Cadet Rech , there is much keener and more serious discontent in the large circle of the “small people” who are dependent on the Ryabushinskys, Golovins and others. 
 What are the political alignments that have taken definite shape in the camp of the opposition, which givespolitical expression to this discontent? One group that hastaken shape is the “responsible”, liberal-monarchist opposi-tion of the Cadets and the Progressists. 
 The bloc of these two parties clearly denotes that the Cadets are much more “to the right” than they seem to be. 
 Another group that has taken shape is that of the working-class democracy, which has undertaken the task, not of“supporting” the Cadet-Progressist opposition, but of utilis-ing the latter’s conflicts with the Rights (including the na-tionalists and the Octobrists) to enlighten and organise the democratic forces. 
 Lastly, the group of the bourgeois democ-racy has also taken shape: at the conference of the Trudo-viks it declared in favour of agreements “in the first place,with the Social-Democrats”, but it did not put forwardany definite slogan calling for a fight against the counter-revolutionary liberalism of the Cadets, which means that in practice it is wavering between the two. 
 What are the conclusions to be drawn from this pre-election “political mobilisation” of the parties? The first andprincipal conclusion, which the working-class democrats drewlong ago, is that there are three , not two, camps engaged in the contest. 
 The liberals are eager to make it appear that the contest is really between two camps; and theliquidators, as has been shown on many occasions, are con-stantly slipping into an acceptance of the same view. 
 “Foror against a constitution?” is how the Cadets formulate thedifference between the two camps. 
 Actually, however, this formulation defines nothing at all, because the Octobrists, too, avow that they are constitutionalists, and indeed, gen-erally speaking, it should be a question not of what canor cannot be called a constitution, but of the exact contentof certain liberal or democratic demands. 
 It is the content of the demands, the real distinctions be-tween the class tendencies, that differentiates the three camps: the Right, or government, camp; the camp of theliberal, or liberal-monarchist, bourgeoisie, which takes a counter-revolutionary stand; and the democratic camp. 
 Furthermore, it is not so much a question of “chances” under the existing electoral system, for the issue goes much deep-er—it concerns the whole character of political propagandaduring the elections, the whole ideological and politicalcontent of the election campaign. 
 In view of this state of affairs, the “strategy” of the liber-als is daily directed towards taking the leadership of the “whole” opposition movement into their hands. 
 The lib-eral Zaprosy Zhizni blurted out the “secret” of this strategy, so carefully kept by Rech . 
 “The Progressists,” writes Mr. 
 R. 
 B. 
 58 in Zaprosy Zhizni No. 
 13, “have opened their cam-paign by a promising move [!]—they formed the so-called‘non-partisan Progressist bloc’, which proved from the first to have a strong appeal for the political opposition circles to the right of the Cadets. 
” On the other hand, “theelection platform of the Trudovik group, despite its vague-ness—in part due to it, perhaps—meets the requirementsof large sections of the democratic intelligentsia”. 
 “Undercertain conditions, the Trudovik group to the left of the Cadets could perform a role similar to that undertaken by the Progressist group to the right of the Cadets. 
 Theopposition front would then be made up of mobile andwavering, but flexible extreme flanks, and an immobilebut persistent centre, which strategically has its advantagein the political struggle as well. 
” What is in the thoughts of the Milyukovs and Shingaryovs is on R. 
 B. 
’s tongue! It is precisely two “flexible” flanks thatthe Cadets need: the Progressists for netting the bourgeoisJune Third voter, and the “vague” democrats for nettingthe democratic-minded public. 
 Indeed, this “strategy” fol-lows from the very nature of the Cadet Party. 
 It is the party of the counter-revolutionary liberals, which by fraudulent means has won the support of certain democratic strata, suchas a section of the shop-assistants, office clerks, etc. 
 Whatsuch a party needs is exactly the “non-partisan Progressist”as its real class bulwark, and the vague democrat as an at-tractive sales ticket. 
 The landlord Yefremov and the millionaire Ryabushinsky may be described as typical Progressists. 
 The typical vaguedemocrat is represented by the Trudovik in the Narodnik camp and the liquidator in the Marxist camp. 
 Take the whole history of the Cadet Party, and you will find that its method has always been democracy in words, and liberalism “of the Yefremov brand and acceptable to Ryabushinsky” in deeds. 
From the defeat of the plan for local land committees in 1906to the vote for the budget in the Third Duma, or to Milyu-kov’s 59 “London” slogans, etc. 
, we see this very nature o f the Cadet Party and its sham-democratic attire . 
 Mr. 
 R. 
 B. 
 of Zaprosy Zhizni is so very clumsy that he inadvertently told the truth, which had been carefully keptfrom the democrats and muddled by the liberals. 
 The pro-gramme of the Progressists, he confesses, “puts the issue ona firm and realistic basis! And yet that programme hasnothing except general phrases in a purely Octobrist style (as, for instance, “the complete realisation of the Manifesto of October 17” 60). 
 What is described as a firm and realistic basis is the basis of a bourgeois liberalism so moderate,so mild and impotent, that it would be simply ridiculousto pin any hopes on it. 
 Those who were “Peaceful Renova-tors” 61 in 1907, those who in the Third Duma steered a middle course between the Cadets and the Octobrists, are described as a firm and realistic basis! The millionaire Ryabushinsky is a Progressist. 
 Utro Rossii62 is the mouthpiece of this and similar Progressists. 
 And none other than Rech , the paper of the Cadets, who have formed a bloc with the Progressists, wrote: “ Utro Rossii , organ of the Moscow industrialists, is gratified [by Kokov-tsov’s speech] more than anyone else .... 
 It echoes Krestovni-kov: ‘Commercial and industrial Moscow can feel satisfied. 
’”And Rech added for its own part: “As far as Golos Moskvy and Utro Rossii are concerned, they are willing not to pur-sue any line, and feel perfectly satisfied. 
” The question arises: where is the evidence that Yefremov or other Progressists have a “line”? There is no such evi-dence. 
 For democrats to support this sort of progressism,whether it is called progressism or Cadetism, would meanonly surrendering their position. 
 But using the conflictsbetween the bourgeoisie and the landlords, between the liberals and the Rights, is another matter. 
 That is the only way in which a democrat can formulate his task. 
 To fulfil this task, to politically enlighten and organise the very wide masses that are economically dependent on the Yefremovs and Ryabushinskys, one has to be well aware of the counter-revolutionary nature of Cadet and Progressist liberalism. 
 The lack of this awareness is the chief defect ofboth the Trudoviks and the liquidators. 
 The Trudoviks saynothing at all about the class characteristics of liberalism. 
The liquidators utter phrases about “wresting the Duma from the hands of the reactionaries”, about the Cadets and Progressists coming closer to power, and about the historically progressive work they are doing (see Martov andDan). 
 Taken as a whole, it adds up to that very role of aCadet “flank” which pleases R. 
 B. 
 so much. 
 To be sure, these are not the subjective wishes of the Tru-doviks and the liquidators and, indeed, it is not a question of their subjective plans, but of the objective alignment of the social forces. 
 And in spite of all the adherents of the ideaof two camps, in spite of the malicious shouts about disor-ganisation in the workers’ democratic movement (see thesame article by Mr. 
 R. 
 B. 
), this alignment clearly shows usthat a third camp has formed. 
 Its line is clearly presented and is known to all. 
 The anti-liquidationist workers are pursuing this line, rallying all the democrats in the struggleboth against the Rights and against the liberals. 
 Without entertaining any illusions about the impotent liberalismof the Cadets, who are grovelling before the reaction in allfundamental questions, the workers are using clashes be-tween that liberalism and the reaction to promote their own cause, their own class organisation, their own democ-racy, which is now quietly ripening in the broad massof the people enslaved by the Yefremovs and Ryabushinskys. 
 Thanks to the anti-liquidationist tactics of the workers, the fight between the Rights and the “responsible” opposi-tion must, and will, serve to develop the political con-sciousness and independent organisation of an “opposition”which lays no claim to the scarcely honourable title of“responsible”.

 ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL STRIKES Ever since 1905 the official strike statistics kept by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry have subdivided strikesinto economic and political. 
 This subdivision was necessitat-ed by reality, which has evolved distinctive forms of the strike movement. 
 The combination of economic and politi-cal strike is one of the main features of these forms. 
 And nowthat there is a revival of the strike movement, it is in theinterest of a scientific analysis, of an intelligent attitude toevents, that the workers should look closely into this dis-tinctive feature of the strike movement in Russia. 
 To begin with, we shall cite several basic figures taken from the government strike statistics. 
 For three years,1905-07, the strike movement in Russia kept at a height un-precedented in the world . 
 Government statistics cover only factories, so that mining, railways, building and numerous other branches of wage-labour are left out. 
 But even in factories alone, the number of strikers was 2,863,000, or alittle less than 3 million, in 1905, 1,108,000 in 1906, and740,000 in 1907. 
 In the fifteen years from 1894 to 1908, dur-ing which strike statistics began to be systematically studiedin Europe, the greatest number of strikers for one year— 60,000—was registered in America. 
 Consequently, the Russian workers were the first in the world to develop the strike struggle on the mass scale that we witnessed in 1905-07. 
 Now it is the British workerswho have lent a new great impetus to the strike movementwith regard to economic strikes. 
 The Russian workers owe their leading role, not to greater strength, better organisa-tion or higher development compared with the workers inWestern Europe, but to the fact that so far Europe has not gone through great national crises with the proletarian masses taking an independent part in them. 
 When such crises do set in, mass strikes in Europe will be even more powerful than they were in Russia in 1905. 
 What was the ratio of economic to political strikes in that period? Government statistics give the following answer: Number of strikers (thousands ) 1905 1906 1907 Economic strikes 1,439 458 200 Political strikes 1,424 650 540 Total .... 
 2,863 1,108 740 This shows the close and inseparable connection between the two kinds of strike. 
 When the movement was at its high-est (1905), the economic basis of the struggle was the broad-est; in that year the political strike rested on the firm andsolid basis of economic strikes. 
 The number of economic strikers was greater than that of political strikers. 
 We see that as the movement declined, in 1906 and 1907, the economic basis contracted : the number of economic strikers dropped to 0. 
4 of the total number of strikers in1906 and to 0. 
3 in 1907. 
 Consequently, the economic andthe political strike support each other, each being a source of strength for the other. 
 Unless these forms of strike are closely interlinked, a really wide mass movement—more-over, a movement of national significance—is impossible. 
 When the movement is in its early stage, the economicstrike often has the effect of awakening and stirring up thebackward, of making the movement a general one, of raising it to a higher plane. 
 In the first quarter of 1905, for instance, economic strikes noticeably predominated over political strikes, the numberof strikers being 604,000 in the former case and only 206,000in the latter. 
 In the last quarter of 1905, however, the ratiowas reversed: 430,000 workers took part in economic strikes, and 847,000 in political strikes. 
 This means that in the early stage of the movement many workers put the economic strug-gle first, while at the height of the movement it was the other way round. 
 But all the time there was a connection between the economic and the political strike. 
 Without such a connection, we repeat, it is impossible to have a really great movement, one that achieves great aims. 
 In a political strike, the working class comes forward as the advanced class of the whole people. 
 In such cases,the proletariat plays not merely the role of one of the classesof bourgeois society, but the role of guide, vanguard, leader. 
 The political ideas manifested in the movement involve the whole people, i. 
e. 
, they concern the basic, most profoundconditions of the political life of the whole country. 
 Thischaracter of the political strike, as has been noted by allscientific investigators of the period 1905-07, brought intothe movement all the classes, and particularly, of course, the widest, most numerous and most democratic sections of the population, the peasantry, and so forth. 
 On the other hand, the mass of the working people will never agree to conceive of a general “progress” of the coun-try without economic demands, without an immediate anddirect improvement in their condition. 
 The masses are drawn into the movement, participate vigorously in it, value it highly and display heroism, self-sacrifice, perseveranceand devotion to the great cause only if it makes for improv-ing the economic condition of those who work. 
 Nor can it beotherwise, for the living conditions of the workers in “ordi-nary” times are incredibly hard. 
 As it strives to improve its living conditions, the working class also progresses morally, intellectually and politically, becomes more capable ofachieving its great emancipatory aims. 
 The strike statistics published by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry fully bear out this tremendous significanceof the economic struggle of the workers in the period of a general revival. 
 The stronger the onslaught of the workers, the greater their achievements in improving their standardof living. 
 The “sympathy of society” and better conditionsof life are both results of a high degree of development ofthe struggle. 
 Whereas the liberals (and the liquidators) tellthe workers: “You are strong when you have the sympathy of ‘society’”, the Marxist tells the workers something dif-ferent, namely: “You have the sympathy of ‘society’ whenyou are strong. 
” What we mean by society in this case is all the various democratic sections of the population, the petty bourgeoisie, the peasants, and the intellectuals, who are in close touch with the life of the workers, office employees, etc. 
 The strike movement was strongest in 1905. 
 And what was the result? We see that in that year the workers achievedthe greatest improvements in their condition. 
 Governmentstatistics show that in 1905 only 29 out of every 100 strikers stopped their fight without having gained anything , i. 
e. 
, were completely defeated. 
 In the previous ten years (1895-1904), as many as 52 strikers out of 100 stopped fightingwithout having gained anything! It follows that the largescale of the struggle contributed immensely to its success , almost doubling it. 
 When the movement began to decline, the success of the struggle began to diminish accordingly. 
 In 1906, 33 strikers out of 100 stopped fighting without having gained anything,or having been defeated, to be exact; in 1907 the figure was58, and in 1908, as high as 69 out of 100!! Thus the scientific statistical data over a number of years fully confirm the personal experience and observations of every class-conscious worker as regards the necessity of combining the economic and the political strike, and theinevitability of this combination in a really broad move-ment of the whole people. 
 The present strike wave likewise fully confirms this con-clusion. 
 In 1911 the number of strikers was double that in 1910 (100,000 against 50,000), but even so their number was extremely small; purely economic strikes remained arelatively “narrow” cause, they did not assume nationalsignificance. 
 On the other hand, today it is obvious to oneand all that the strike movement following the well-knownevents of last April had precisely this significance. 
 63 It is therefore highly important to rebuff from the outset the attempts of the liberals and liberal labour politicians(liquidators) to distort the character of the movement. 
 Mr. 
 Severyanin, a liberal, contributed to Russkiye Vedomos-ti 64 an article against “admixing” economic or “any other [aha!] demands” to the May Day strike, and the Cadet Rech sympathetically reprinted in the main passages of the article. 
 “More often than not” writes the liberal gentleman, “it is unrea-sonable to link such strikes with May Day .... 
 Indeed, it would be rather strange to do so: we are celebrating the international workers’ holiday, and we use the occasion to demand a ten per cent rise forcalico of such-and-such grades. 
” ( Rech No. 
 132. 
) What is quite clear to the workers seems “strange” to the liberal. 
 Only the defenders of the bourgeoisie and itsexcessive profits can sneer at the demand for a “rise”. 
 Butthe workers know that it is the widespread character of the demand for a rise, it is the comprehensive character of a strike, that has the greatest power to attract a multitude of new participants, to ensure the strength of the onslaughtand the sympathy of society, and to guarantee both the suc-cess of the workers and the national significance of theirmovement. 
 That is why it is necessary to fight with determi-nation against the liberal distortion preached by Mr. 
 Seve-ryanin, Russkiye Vedomosti and Rech , and to warn the workers in every way against this kind of sorry advisers. 
 Mr. 
 V. 
 Yezhov, a liquidator, writing in the very first issue of the liquidationist Nevsky Golos , 65 offers a similar purely liberal distortion, although he approaches the ques-tion from a somewhat different angle. 
 He dwells in particu-lar on the strikes provoked by the May Day fines. 
 Correctly pointing out that the workers are not sufficiently organised,the author draws from his correct statement conclusions thatare quite wrong and most harmful to the workers. 
 Mr. 
 Ye-zhov sees a lack of organisation in the fact that while in onefactory the workers struck merely in protest, in another they added economic demands, etc. 
 Actually, however, this variety of forms of strike does not in itself indicate any lack of organisation at all; it is ridiculous to imagine that or-ganisation necessarily means uniformity! Lack of organisa-tion is not at all to be found where Mr. 
 Yezhov looks for it. 
 But his conclusion is still worse: “Owing to this [i. 
e. 
, owing to the variety of the strikes and to the different forms of the combination of economics and politics], the principle involved in the protest (after all, it was not over a fewkopeks that the strike was called) became obscured in a considerablenumber of cases, being complicated by economic demands.... 
” This is a truly outrageous, thoroughly false and thoroughly liberal argument! To think that the demand “for a few ko-peks” is capable of “obscuring” the principle involved in the /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR protest means sinking to the level of a Cadet. 
 On the con-trary, Mr. 
 Yezhov, the demand for “a few kopeks” deserves full recognition and not a sneer! On the contrary, Mr. 
 Yezhov, that demand, far from “obscuring” “the principle involved in the protest”, emphasises it! Firstly, the question of a higher standard of living is also a question of principle, and a most important one; secondly, whoever protests, notagainst one, but against two, three, etc. 
, manifestations of oppression, does not thereby weaken his protest but strength-ens it. 
 Every worker will indignantly reject Mr. 
 Yezhov’s outra-geous liberal distortion of the matter. 
 In the case of Mr. 
 Yezhov, it is by no means a slip of the pen. 
 He goes on to say even more outrageous things: “Their own experience should have suggested to the workers that it was inadvisable to complicate their protest by economic de-mands, just as it is inadvisable to complicate an ordinary strike bya demand involving a principle. 
” This is untrue, a thousand times untrue! The Nevsky Golos has disgraced itself by printing such stuff. 
 What Mr. 
 Yezhov thinks inadvisable is perfectly advisable. 
 Both each worker’s own experience and the experience of a very large number of Russian workers in the recent past testifyto the reverse of what Mr. 
 Yezhov preaches. 
 Only liberals can object to “complicating” even the most “ordinary” strike by “demands involving principles”. 
 That is the first point. 
 Secondly, our liquidator is sorely mistaken in measuring the present movement with the yard-stick of an “ordinary” strike. 
 And Mr. 
 Yezhov is wasting his time in trying to cover up his liberal contraband with someone else’s flag, in confus-ing the question of combining the economic and the politi-cal strike with the question of preparations for the one or the other! Of course, it is most desirable to make prepara-tions and to be prepared, and to do this as thoroughly,concertedly, unitedly, intelligently and firmly as possible. 
That is beyond dispute. 
 But, contrary to what Mr. 
 Yezhovsays, it is necessary to make preparations precisely for a combination of the two kinds of strike. 
 “A period of economic strikes is ahead of us,” writes Mr. 
 Yezhov. 
 “It would be an irreparable mistake to allow them to become inter-twined with political actions of the workers. 
 Such combination would have a harmful effect on both the economic and the political struggle of the workers. 
” One could hardly go to greater lengths! These words show in the clearest possible way that the liquidator has sunk tothe level of an ordinary liberal. 
 Every sentence contains anerror! We must convert every sentence into its direct opposite to get at the truth! It is not true that a period of economic strikes is ahead of us. 
 Quite the reverse. 
 What we have ahead of us is a periodof something more than just economic strikes. 
 We are facinga period of political strikes. 
 The facts, Mr. 
 Yezhov, arestronger than your liberal distortions; and if you could lookat the statistical cards dealing with strikes, which are filed in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, you would see that even these government statistics fully refute you. 
 It is not true that “intertwining” would be a mistake. 
 Quite the reverse. 
 It would be an irreparable mistake ifthe workers failed to understand the great singularity, thegreat significance, the great necessity, and the great funda-mental importance of precisely such “intertwining”. 
 Fortu-nately, however, the workers understand this perfectly, andthey brush aside with contempt the preaching of liberallabour politicians. 
 Lastly, it is not true that such intertwining “would have a harmful effect” on both forms. 
 Quite the reverse. 
 It bene-fits both. 
 It strengthens both. 
 Mr. 
 Yezhov lectures some “hotheads” whom he seems to have discovered. 
 Listen to this: “It is necessary to give organisational form to the senti-ments of the workers .... 
” This is gospel truth! “It is neces-sary to increase propaganda for trade unions, to recruit new members for them.... 
” Quite true, but— but, Mr. 
 Yezhov, it is impermissible to reduce “organisational form” to the trade unions alone. 
 Remember this, Mr. 
 Liquidator! “This is all the more necessary since there are many hotheads among the workers nowadays who are carried away by the mass movement and speak at meetings against unions , alleging them to be useless and unnecessary. 
” This is a liberal slur on the workers. 
 It is not “against unions” that the workers—who have been, and always will be, a thorn in the side of the liquidators—have been coming out. 
 No, the workers have been coming out againstthe attempt to reduce the organisational form to “trade unions” alone, an attempt which is so evident from Mr. 
Yezhov’s preceding sentence. 
 The workers have been coming out, not “against unions”, but against the liberal distortion of the nature of the strug-gle they are waging, a distortion which pervades the wholeof Mr. 
 Yezhov’s article. 
 The Russian workers have become sufficiently mature po-litically to realise the great significance of their movementfor the whole people. 
 They are sufficiently mature to see how very false and paltry liberal labour policy is and they will always brush it aside with contempt.

 Petrov the text in the symposium Marxism and Liquidationism , Part II, St. 
 Petersburg, 1914 THE PROBLEM OF RESETTLEMENT As we know, the government and the counter-revolutiona-ry parties had placed especially great hopes in the settle-ment of peasants on new land. 
 All the counter-revolution-aries expected that if it would not solve the agrarian problem radically, then at least it would blunt it considerably and render it much less dangerous. 
 That is why they adver-tised resettlement with particular zeal and encouraged it inevery way at the imminent approach, and then during thedevelopment, of the peasant movement in European Russia. 
 What is in the thoughts of the government representa-tives and the more far-sighted politicians of, say, the Octo-brist Party, is on the tongue of such undisguised reaction-aries as Markov the Second, the diehard 66 from Kursk. 
 Dur-ing the debate on the resettlement problem in the Duma,this deputy declared frankly, with praiseworthy straight-forwardness: “Yes, it is by means of resettlement that the government should solve the agrarian problem. 
” (First Session. 
) There is no doubt that resettlement, if properly organised, could play a role of some importance in Russia’s economicdevelopment. 
 To be sure, this role must not be overratedeven today, when the condition of the Russian muzhik is so intolerable that he is willing to go anywhere, not only to Siberia, but to the end of the world; even today, whenthe peasants who own little or no land are encouraged inevery way to migrate and settle as colonists, so as to keepthem from the temptation of contemplating the landlords’latifundia, and when the decree of November 9 67 has great-ly facilitated for the settlers the liquidation of the rem-nants of their farms at home; even today, as even the apolo-gists of the theory of a natural population increase must admit. 
 It is only in the gubernias that provide the largest percentage of emigrants (the South, West, and the black-earth central area of Russia), that their number equals the natural increase of the population, or slightly exceeds it. 
 Nevertheless, there is still a substantial reserve of unoc-cupied land in Siberia suitable for resettlement. 
 True, verylittle has been done so far to ascertain the extent of thatreserve even approximately. 
 In 1896 Kulomzin set the re-serve of land fit for resettlement at 130,000 per capita allot-ments. 
 Since then ten times as many allotments have beenapportioned, but the reserve has not yet been exhausted. 
On the contrary, according to estimates of the ResettlementDepartment, by 1900 the reserve of land suitable for reset-tlement amounted to three million per capita allotments, sufficient to provide for six million settlers. 
 As we see, the figures differ considerably, and the range of the variationbetween them is very great. 
 Be that as it may, even discounting a certain percentage of the last-mentioned figures to allow for the usual bureau-cratic complacency, it is certain that there is still a reserve of land in Siberia and that, consequently, its settlement could have a certain importance both for Siberia and Rus-sia, provided it was properly organised. 
 It is just this conditio sine qua non that the present gov-ernment does not comply with. 
 The present organisationof resettlement once again demonstrates and proves that our “old order” is quite incapable of meeting even the most elementary economic requirements of the population. 
 Thebad organisation of resettlement is additional evidence thatthe present masters of the situation are powerless to doanything at all for the economic progress of the country. 
 An explanation of the trend, character and implementa-tion of the resettlement policy was given by the Social-Democratic deputies to the Duma in their speeches duringeach year’s discussion of budget appropriations for the Re-settlement Department. 
 What is the government’s aim in resettling the peasants? That is the main question, the answer to which determines the answer to all the others; for the aim of the government’s resettlement policy determines its entire character. 
 Deputy Voiloshnikov, who spoke for the Social-Democrat-ic group at the Second Session of the Duma, described as fol-lows the government’s aims in resettling the peasants: “The resettlement policy is an element of the government’s agrar-ian policy as a whole. 
 When the landlords needed economi-cally weak or insecure peasants as a source of cheap labour,the government did everything to impede resettlement andto keep the surplus population where it was. 
 What is more,it strongly opposed voluntary migration, trying thereby to close that safety valve. 
 But the natural growth of the popu-lation went on, and times changed. 
 Storm clouds—the pro-letariat and the starving peasantry—loomed large, withall their consequences. 
 The government and the landlordsseized upon resettlement, which, together with the decreeof November 9, they made the basis of their agrarian policy. 
 However, in regard to implementing the decree, attention was centred on the economically strong and prosperous, ontaking the land from the poor and transferring it to theprosperous peasants. 
 But in regard to resettlement it is amatter of packing off the poor peasants to Siberia in aslarge numbers as possible; and while lately there has been evidence of a tendency to an increase in the average propor-tion of prosperous settlers, the bulk still consists of weakpeasants, to use Stolypin’s terminology. 
 The land commit-tees are also taking part, or, I should say, have been en-listed to take part in this business of packing off peasantsin increased numbers. 
 “The land committees have been charged with assigning the settlers their plots and thus putting an end to the for-mer agrarian disorders. 
 It follows, gentlemen, that the decreeof November 9, the vigorous advertisement of resettlement,the vigorous drive to pack off the weak peasants to Siberia,and the activities of the land committees are two closely connected aspects of the same problem and the same policy. 
 It will be readily seen that the implementation of the decreeof November 9 helps settlement of the prosperous and strongon the allotments at the expense of the weak peasants, andwill thereby help to squeeze out these weak elements, whoare not very suitable as settlers, into border regions that are alien to them. 
 Both as regards the village commune and mig-ration, the government’s resettlement policy has been guidedsolely by the interests of a handful of semi-feudal landlords and of the ruling classes in general, who are oppressing the masses of workers and the labouring peasantry. 
 The govern-ment shows no understanding of the elementary require-ments of the country and of the needs of the national econo-my. 
” (Second Session, 77th sitting. 
) This aspect of the matter was disclosed most fully by Deputy Chkheidze (in his speech during the Second Sessionof the Duma), who drew a detailed picture of the resettle-ment policy in the Caucasus. 
 To begin with, the Social-Democratic deputy proved by facts and figures that all the official reports about vacantland in the Caucasus are in glaring conflict with the truth. 
 It should be specially stressed that Deputy Chkheidze, in order to forestall any accusation of partiality or distortion, used only official data and the reports of government of-ficials. 
 According to the figures collected as long ago as the eighties by the former Minister of State Property, “among the state peasants alone, who have been settled on state land in the Caucasus, there were, in the four Trans-caucasian gubernias, 22,000 persons who owned no land at all, 66,000 with allotments of less than one dessiatineper capita, 254,000 with allotments of from one to two dessiatines per capita, and 5,013 with allotments of from two to four dessiatines, a total of about 1,000,000 persons having smaller allotments than the minimum fixed for the settlers who have established themselves in the Caucasus. 
 In Kutais Gubernia, 2,541 out of 29,977 household owned no land or less than one dessiatine per household, 4,227 owned from one to two dessiatines per household, 4,016 from two to three, and 5,321 from three to five. 
 According to the latest data, 46 per cent of the villages in the four Transcaucasian gubernias had no state land at all or very little, and in Kutais Gubernia the number of unprovided households was approximately 33 per cent of the total. 
 From the report of the Baku Committee on the needs of the agricultural industries we know that such villages insuffi-ciently provided with land send the landless peasants to take up their residence with those owning large allotments and they remain for many years in this dependent posi-tion. 
 And Senator Kuzminsky, in a report submitted to the Emperor, says the following: ‘It has been noted that sometimes the settlers consist of persons who have given up farming and lease the land received for purposes of re-settlement to fellow villagers or to native peasants in a neighbouring village. 
’ Thus even twenty-five years ago therewere in Transcaucasia hundreds of thousands of state peas-ants—who, one would think, should have been better pro-vided than other categories of peasants, and whom onecould describe without exaggeration as farm labourers. 
 As far back as some twenty-five years ago the local peasants were compelled to rent the land that was allotted to settlers”. 
 Such are the data enabling us to judge of the extent to which the state peasants in the Caucasus are provided with land. 
 “As for the so-called temporarily bonded68 peasants,” the speaker went on to say, “we see from an examination of the verified deedsthat in Tiflis Gubernia 1,444 households were left without any landand 386 households received no land even for their dwelling-houses and gardens. 
 They comprise 13 per cent of the total number of land-lords’ peasants in Tiflis Gubernia. 
 In Kutais Gubernia there was aneven greater number of peasants left without land after the Reform. 
Even if we take the Tiflis ratio to apply to the former serfs in all thegubernias, we get in Kutais Gubernia 5,590 households, representing25,000 persons, who received not a single patch of land when the peasants were emancipated in the Caucasus. 
 Twenty years after the Reform, in 1895, continues the author of the memorandum on theabolition of obligatory relations, there were in Yelisavetpol Gubernia5,308 landless households, or 25,000 persons of both sexes. 
 In BakuGubernia there were 3,906 households, or 11,709 landless personsof both sexes. 
 And here are data on the amount of land held by the peasants who were temporarily bonded and who have not redeemed their allotments but have some kind of farm. 
 In Tiflis Gubernia the percapita amount is 0. 
9 dessiatine, and in Kutais Gubernia 0. 
6 dessiatine. 
Among those who have redeemed their allotments, the per capitaholdings amount to 1. 
7 dessiatines in Tiflis Gubernia and to 0. 
7dessiatine in Kutais Gubernia. 
 That is the extent to which peasants having some sort of farm are provided with land. 
 We find a general description of the economic position of the peasants in the Caucasusin the report of the Kutais Gubernia Committee on the needs of theagricultural industries. 
 According to data culled from various officialinvestigations, the proportion of peasants suffering acute want inKutais Gubernia is as high as 70 per cent. 
 Furthermore, it is also pointed out that 25 per cent of the nobility in that gubernia are suffer-ing acute want. 
 “Owners of such plots of land can retain their economic independ-ence,” the report goes on to say, “only if they have earnings outsidetheir farms, and they are in no position to spend anything at all onimprovements, implements and fertiliser. 
 The big demand could not but have an effect on the cost of renting allotments, which is as high as 60 per cent of the gross income in the case of the share-cropping system, and sometimes, in years of a poor crop, payment in the formof a definite quantity of the produce of the land exceeds the grossincome. 
 Cases of land being leased for money are rare, and the rent amounts to 30 rubles per dessiatine a year. 
 This is the situation in Kutais Gubernia. 
 And now a few figures on the amount of land heldby the peasants in four uyezds of Yelisavetpol Gubernia. 
 Accordingto data concerning all the peasants who live on the owner’s land, theholdings in four uyezds of Yelisavetpol Gubernia, namely, Jibrail,Zangezur, Shusha and Jevanshir, are up to 0. 
6 dessiatine per person. 
 Senator Kuzminsky has calculated that the average allotment per male person among the peasants settled on the owner’s land in Len-koran Uyezd of Baku Gubernia amounts to 0. 
5 dessiatine, and inKuba Uyezd to 0. 
9 dessiatine. 
 That, gentlemen,” the speaker conclud-ed, “is how the peasants in Transcaucasia are provided with land. 
” Since the condition of the Caucasian peasants as regards land-hunger differs but little from that of the peasants in Russia, where, one may ask, does the reserve of land forresettlement in the Caucasus come from, and why are peoplesent there as settlers, instead of resettlement of the localpeasants being carried out? The land for resettlement is obtained as a result of flag-rant violation of the land rights of the native inhabitants, and the settlement of peasants from Russia is carried on forthe glory of the old nationalist principle of “Russificationof the outlying regions”. 
 Deputy Chkheidze cited a number of facts, likewise culled from official sources, about how whole villages of natives were driven from their homes so that a reserve of land might be created for resettlement, how court trials were engineeredto justify the expropriation of land held by mountaineers(report on the mountain village of Kiknaveleti, KutaisUyezd, submitted by Prince Tsereteli, Marshal of the No-bility, to the Minister of the Interior), etc. 
 Nor were all these isolated or exceptional facts but “typical cases”, as was also established by Senator Kuzminsky. 
 The result is downright hostile relations between the set-tlers and the natives. 
 Thus, for instance, when the Alar com-munity was driven from its lands, “evicted”, to quote Sen-ator Kuzminsky, “without being provided with land, and left to its fate”, the settlers who seized its land were armed at government expense: the uyezd rural superintendents 69 were ordered to “see to it that the peasants of the newly-established villages on the Mugan, including those from Pokrovskoye, were supplied with arms—ten Berdan rifles for each hundred households”. 
 This is an interesting illus-tration of the “nationalist course” of the present policy. 
 Nevertheless, Right-wing deputies to the Duma spoke triumphantly of the existence of a reserve for resettlementamounting to 1,700,000 dessiatines, citing the report of theVice-Gerent of the Caucasus to this effect. 
 However, ac-cording also to the testimony of the Vice-Gerent, nearly half of this reserve has already been taken over by settlers,while a considerable part of it is situated in areas where—according again to the Vice-Gerent’s evidence—it isphysically impossible for cultivators unaccustomed to theconditions to engage in farming. 
 Deputy Chkheidze also spoke of the way in which the government provides for the new settlers. 
 “Inadequate watersupply and lack of irrigation on the land set aside for reset-tlement,” says the report of the Vice-Gerent, “particu-larly in the eastern areas of Transcaucasia, is one of themain reasons why many peasants already settled migrate back again. 
 In the Black Sea region the new settlers are de-serting their farms because of the absence of roads suitablefor wheeled traffic not only between the various settlements,but even within each of the resettlement areas. 
 To this itshould be added that in their turn the unfavourable climaticconditions, to which the settlers are unaccustomed and which are attended in many parts of the Caucasus by ma-laria that affects not only people but livestock as well, noless than the lack of roads, cause the less sturdy of the newsettlers to flee from the Caucasus. 
 Due to the above-mention-ed causes there is a continuous migration in evidence fromthe Yelisavetpol and Baku gubernias and from Daghestan Region, as well as from the Tiflis and Black Sea gubernias. 
” The upshot is that the results of the resettlement in the Caucasus are assessed by the Vice-Gerent himself as fol-lows: “The attitude taken so far to the Caucasian popula-tion and its land affairs can no longer be tolerated, if onlybecause it undoubtedly plays a rather prominent part in fos-tering revolutionary sentiments among the rural population. 
” The government and the ruling classes are pursuing very similar aims in settling peasants in Siberia; here, too, in view of the political objectives involved, no consideration whatever is given either to the interests of the settlers or to the rights of the old residents. 
 In the emigration areas, in Russia, resettlement matters have now been entrusted to the land committees, the ruralsuperintendents and the governors. 
 Vitally interested asthey are in reducing the number of peasants with little orno land and in leaving only as many of them as are needed to provide for the requirements of the big landowners (as a source of supply of wage-labour), the land committeeshave shown such zeal in “moving” poor peasants as to shockeven the Resettlement Department. 
 “The land commit-tees,” complained one official of the Department, “formparties of completely destitute people who at the outset need an allowance for their travelling expenses, who need a loan not for setting up a home but for food; and evenif, as an exception, a settler happens to have some littlemoney, he spends it all on fares and food. 
” Swarms of these “weak” foster-children of the land policy which proclaimed as its motto “stake on the strong” are being sent off to Siberia in unaltered cattle wagons, packed chock-full with old men, children, pregnant women. 
 In thesecattle wagons (which bear the famous inscription: “40men, 8 horses”), the emigrants have to cook their foodand wash their linen; lying in them, too, are often personsafflicted with contagious diseases, whom the emigrants usually keep out sight lest they be removed from the train and thus fall behind the party. 
 At terminal points andstations the emigrants are at best provided with tents;in the worst cases they are left in the open, with no shelterfrom sun or rain. 
 Deputy Voiloshnikov told the Duma thatat Sretensk he had seen people stricken with typhus lying in the open, with no protection from the rain. 
 And condi-tions such as those described above, under which the peas-ants have to travel, two Ministers (Stolypin and Krivo-shein) find to be “tolerable”. 
 “The sanitary conditions pro-vided for the settlers on their way are tolerable,” they wrotein a report to the Emperor; “many of them even find conve-niences en route to which they have not been accustomed. 
” Truly, there is no limit to bureaucratic complacency! After going through such ordeals on their way to “the promised land”, the poorest emigrants find no happiness in Siberia either. 
 Here, for instance, is how Deputy Voilosh-nikov described their condition in the new places of settle-ment by quoting from official reports. 
 One official (a special inspector of the Resettlement Department) writes: “Most of the lots are scattered amongtaiga forests without water, without ploughland, andwithout pastures. 
” Another adds: “The granting of loans has entirely lost its significance as a means for setting up homes; the amount of the loans is in itself too small to beof real help in this respect. 
 The established procedure ofgranting loans has turned the latter into a matter of charitypure and simple, for it is impossible to set up a home andlive for two years on the 150 rubles granted as a loan. 
” And here, by way of example, is a description of the sani-tary conditions of the new settlers, quoted from the sameofficial reports: “After the typhus,” writes one official, * “scurvy has been raging here on a no lesser scale; practically in all the settlements and inevery house there are people suffering from this disease or liable tocontract it. 
 In many homes there are cases of both diseases. 
 In theOkur-Shask settlement I came across the following picture: the masterof the house was ill with typhus in the period of peeling; his preg-nant wife was extremely exhausted from undernourishment; their son, a boy of twelve, had swollen glands and scurvy, the wife’s sisterwas sick with scurvy and could not walk; she had a breast-fed baby;her ten-year-old boy was sick with scurvy, was bleeding throughthe nose and could hardly move; her husband alone, of the wholefamily, was well. 
 “Scurvy and typhus are followed by night blindness. 
 There are settlements in which literally all the settlers, without exception,suffer from this blindness. 
 The groups of lots along the Yemna Riverare covered almost entirely with taiga forests, have no pastures ormeadowland, and in the course of two or three years the new settlersbarely managed to clear the ground to build wretched huts. 
 There could be no question of the settlers having their own grain; they had to live entirely on the loans, and when these gave out there was aterrible scarcity of bread; many literally starved. 
 The scarcity ofbread was aggravated by the scarcity of drinking water. 
” Such reports are plentiful. 
 Appalling as these official ac-counts are, they apparently do not tell the whole truth, and *Memorandum , p. 
 8. 
 thus give too favourable a picture of the actual state of affairs. 
 Here is, for instance, how Prince Lvov, a man, as we know, of moderate views, who visited the Far East as a representative of the Zemstvo organisation, describes reset-tlement in Amur Territory: “Cut off from the world as if they were on an uninhabited island, amid marshy hummocks in the primeval taiga, amid swampy val-leys and swampy hills, and forced to put up with barbaric conditionsof life, labour and subsistence, the dispirited and indigent settlernaturally feels crushed. 
 He lapses into a state of apathy, havingexhausted his small store of energy at the very beginning of his strug-gle against harsh natural conditions in setting up his wretched dwel-ling. 
 Scurvy and typhus attack the wasted organism and carry it off to the grave. 
 In many of the settlements founded in 1907, the deathrate is simply incredible—25 to 30 per cent. 
 There are as many crossesas there are households, and many settlements are doomed to beremoved completely to new sites or to the grave-yard. 
 Instead ofresettlement, what rivers of bitter tears shed by unhappy families and what costly funerals at state expense in the remote borderland! It will be long before those who survived last year’s great wave ofresettlement will stand on their feet again after their defeat in thetaiga. 
 Many will die, and many others will flee back to Russia, wherethey will defame the territory by stories about their misfortunes,scaring off new settlers and holding up further resettlement. 
 It is not accidental that this year we witness an unprecedented reverse movement from the Maritime Region, and an influx of new settlersthat is one-fifth of the former proportion. 
” Prince Lvov is justly appalled by the isolation of the set-tler from the world and his desolation in the boundless Sibe-rian taiga, particularly in view of the lack of roads in Sibe-ria. 
 We can imagine with what brilliant success the policyof setting up separate homestead farms and the apportion-ment of otrubs is now being put into effect there, for the very same men who direct the agrarian policy have proc-laimed “the necessity for a decisive turn [!] in the landpolicy in Siberia”, the necessity of “establishing and pro-moting private property”, of “ensuring that individualpeasants have their plots in accordance with the decree of November 9, 1906”, “assigning lots for resettle-ment, with the land divided, as far as possible, into otrub holdings”, * etc. 
 The conditions of resettlement being what they are, it is quite natural that, according to the Resettlement Depart-*Memorandum , pp. 
 60, 61, 62. 
 ment, 10 per cent of the peasants settled in 1903-05 owned not a single draught animal, 12 per cent owned only one draught animal per household, 15 per cent owned no cow, and 25 per cent owned no plough (from the speech of DeputyGaidarov during the First Session, when he spoke on behalfof the Social-Democratic group). 
 Deputy Voiloshnikov,basing himself on the same official reports, was thereforefully justified when he summed up the results of the reset-tlement policy in 1906-08 as follows: “In three years—1906, 1907 and 1908—1,552,439 persons of both sexes, half of them paupers, lured by the government’s advertising, were sent across the Urals, into unknown parts, and there left to their fate. 
 According to the Resettlement Department, 564,041 personssettled down, and 284,984 persons of both sexes went back. 
 Thus theResettlement Department provides information about 849,025 per-sons. 
 But what has become of the rest? Where are the other 703,414persons? The government, gentlemen, is perfectly well informed of their bitter lot, but it will say nothing about them. 
 Some of them have gone to live in the villages of the old residents, and some othershave swollen the ranks of the Siberian proletariat and are beggingfor alms. 
 “As for the vast majority, the government arranged a costly fune-ral for them, and that is why it keeps silent about them. 
” That is how the hopes of Markov the Second to “solve the agrarian problem” through resettlement are materialising. 
 Faced with these facts, even the Octobrist spokesmen of bigcapital had to admit that there are “defects in the resettle-ment work”. 
 During the First Session the Octobrists called(and the Duma supported them) for “changing and improv-ing the travelling conditions of the emigrants”, for “creat-ing in the resettlement areas the conditions necessary for their cultural and economic development”, and for “respect-ing the interests and rights of the local peasantry and thenon-Russian population when apportioning the land andsettling the peasants”. 
 It goes without saying that thesecautious and deliberately ambiguous wishes have to this day remained “a voice crying in the wilderness”. 
 And the Octobrist woodpeckers patiently repeat them year after year.

 THE REVOLUTIONAR Y UPSWIN G70 The great May Day strike of the proletariat of all Russia and the accompanying street demonstrations, revolutionary leaflets, and revolutionary speeches before gatherings of workers have clearly shown that Russia has entered a period of revolutionary upswing. 
 This upswing did not come as a bolt from the blue. 
 The way had been paved for it over a long period by all theconditions of Russian life, and the mass strikes over theLena shootings and the May Day strikes merely marked its actual arrival. 
 The temporary triumph of the counter-revo-lution was inseparably bound up with a decline in the massstruggle of the workers. 
 The number of strikers gives anapproximate yet absolutely objective and precise idea ofthe extent of the struggle. 
 During the ten years preceding the revolution, from 1895 to 1904, the average number of strikers was 43,000 a year(in round figures). 
 In 1905 there were 2,750,000 strikers, in1906—1,000,000, and in 1907—750,000. 
 The three yearsof the revolution were distinguished by a rise in the strikemovement of the proletariat unprecedented anywhere in the world . 
 Its decline, which began in 1906-07, became definite in 1908, when there were 175,000 strikers. 
 The coup d’étatof June 3, 1907, which restored the autocratic rule of thetsar in alliance with the Duma of the Black-Hundred land-lords and the commercial and industrial magnates, was aninevitable result of the flagging of the revolutionary energyof the masses. 
 The three years 1908-10 were a period of Black-Hundred counter-revolution at its worst, of liberal-bourgeois rene-gacy and of proletarian despondency and disintegration. 
 The number of strikers steadily dropped, reaching 60,000 in 1909 and 50,000 in 1910. 
 However, a noticeable change set in at the end of 1910. 
 The demonstrations in connection with the death of the lib-eral Muromtsev, and of Leo Tolstoy, and also the studentmovement, clearly indicated that a fresh breeze had begunto blow, that the mood of the democratic masses hadreached a turning-point. 
 The year 1911 saw the workers grad-ually going over to an offensive —the number of strikers rose to 100,000. 
 Signs from various quarters indicate thatthe weariness and stupor brought about by the triumphof the counter-revolution are passing away, that once againthere is an urge for revolution. 
 In summing up the situation, the All-Russia Conference, held in January 1912, noted that “the onset of a political revival is to be noted among broad democratic circles, chiefly among the proletariat. 
The workers’ strikes in 1910-11, the beginning of demon-strations and proletarian meetings, the start of a move-ment among urban bourgeois democrats (the studentstrikes), etc. 
, are all indications of the growing revolution-ary feelings of the masses against the June Third regime”. 
 (See the “Notification” of the Conference, p. 
 18. 
 *) By the second quarter of this year these sentiments had become so strong that they manifested themselves in actionsby the masses, and brought about a revolutionary upswing . 
 The course of events during the past eighteen months shows with perfect clarity that there is nothing accidental in this upswing, that it has come quite naturally and was madeinevitable by the whole development of Russia in theprevious period. 
 The Lena shootings led to the revolutionary temper of the masses developing into a revolutionary upswing of the masses. 
 Nothing could be more false than the liberal inven-tion, which Trotsky repeats in the Vienna Pravda after the liquidators, that “the struggle for freedom of associationis the basis of both the Lena tragedy and the powerful re-sponse to it in the country”. 
 Freedom of association was nei-ther the specific nor the principal demand in the Lena strike. 
 It was not lack of the freedom of association that the Lena *See present edition, Vol. 
 17, p.

— Ed. 
 shootings revealed, but lack of freedom from provocation, lack of rights in general, lack of freedom from wholesale tyranny. 
 The Lena shootings, as we have already made clear in Sotsial-Demokrat71 No. 
 26, were an exact reflection of the entire regime of the June Third monarchy. 
 It was not at all the struggle for one of the rights of the proletariat, even the most fundamental, the most important of them, that was characteristic of the Lena events. 
 What was characteristic of those events was the complete absence of any kind of elementary legality. 
 The characteristic feature was that anagent provocateur , a spy, a secret police agent, a menial of the tsar, resorted to mass shootings without any politicalreason whatever. 
 It is this general lack of rights typical of Russian life, this hopelessness and impossibility of fight-ing for particular rights , and this incorrigibility of the tsar-ist monarchy and of its entire regime, that stood out sodistinctly against the background of the Lena events as tofire the masses with revolutionary ardour. 
 The liberals have been straining every nerve to represent the Lena events and the May Day strikes as a trade union movement and a struggle for “rights”. 
 But anyone who isnot blinded by liberal (and liquidationist) controversieswill see in them something different. 
 He will see the revolu-tionary character of the mass strike, which is especially emphasised by the St. 
 Petersburg May Day leaflet of various Social-Democratic groups (and even of one group of worker Socialist-Revolutionaries!), which we reprint in fullin our news section, 72 and which repeats the slogans ad-vanced by the All-Russia Conference of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
in January 1912. 
 And then, it is not really slogans that are the main proof of the revolutionary character of the Lena and May Day strikes. 
 The slogans formulated what the facts showed. 
 The mass strikes spreading from district to district, their tre-mendous growth, the speed with which they spread, the cour-age of the workers, the increased number of mass meetingsand revolutionary speeches, the demand that the fines im-posed for celebrating May Day be cancelled, and the combi-nation of the political and the economic strike, familiar tous from the time of the first Russian revolution, are all obvious indications of the true nature of the movement, which is a revolutionary upswing of the masses . 
 Let us recall the experience of 1905. 
 Events show that the tradition of the revolutionary mass strike lives on among the workers and that the workers at once took up and revivedthis tradition. 
 The strike wave of 1905, unprecedentedin the world, involved 810,000 strikers during the first, and1,277,000 during the last quarter of the year, being a combi-nation of the political and the economic strike. 
 According to tentative estimates, the strikes over the Lena events in-volved about 300,000 workers and the May Day strikesabout 400,000, and the strike movement continues to grow. 
Every day the newspapers, even the liberal ones, bring newsof how the wildfire of strikes is spreading. 
 The second quarter of 1912 is not quite over, and yet it is already becoming quite obvious that, as regards the size of the strike move-ment, the beginning of the revolutionary upswing in 1912is not lower , but rather higher than the beginning in 1905! The Russian revolution was the first to develop on a large scale this proletarian method of agitation, of rousing and uniting the masses and of drawing them into the struggle. 
 Now the proletariat is applying this method once again andwith an even firmer hand. 
 No power on earth could achievewhat the revolutionary vanguard of the proletariat is achiev-ing by this method. 
 A huge country, with a population of150,000,000 spread over a vast area, scattered, oppressed, deprived of all rights, ignorant, fenced off from “evil in-fluences” by a swarm of authorities, police, spies—the whole of this country is getting into a ferment. 
 The most backwardsections both of the workers and the peasants are cominginto direct or indirect contact with the strikers. 
 Hundredsof thousands of revolutionary agitators are all at once appear-ing on the scene. 
 Their influence is infinitely increased by the fact that they are inseparably linked with the rank andfile, with the masses, and that they remain among them,fight for the most urgent needs of every worker’s family, and combine with this immediate struggle for urgent eco-nomic needs their political protest and struggle against the monarchy. 
 For counter-revolution has stirred up in millions and tens of millions of people a bitter hatred for the mon-archy, it has given them the rudiments of an understanding of the part played by it, and now the slogan of the foremost workers of the capital—long live the democratic republic!— spreads through thousands of channels, in the wake of every strike, reaching the backward sections, the remotest prov-inces, the “people”, the “depths of Russia”! Very characteristic are the comments made on strikes by Severyanin, a liberal, which were welcomed by Russkiye Vedomosti and sympathetically reprinted by Rech : “Have the workers any grounds for admixing economic or any [!] demands to a May Day strike?” asks Mr. 
 Severyanin; and he answers: “I make bold to think that they have none. 
 Every economicstrike can and should be begun only after a serious weighing of its chances of success .... 
 That is why, more often than not, it is unreason-able to link such strikes with May Day .... 
 Indeed, it would be rather strange to do so: we are celebrating the international workers’ holi-day, and we use the occasion to demand a ten per cent rise for calico of such-and-such grades. 
” That is how the liberal reasons! And this piece of infinite vulgarity, meanness and nastiness is sympathetically accept-ed by the “best” liberal papers, which claim to be demo-cratic! The crudest self-interest of a bourgeois, the vilest coward-ice of a counter-revolutionary—that is what lies behind the florid phrases of the liberal. 
 He wants the pockets of the employers to be safe. 
 He wants an “orderly” and “harm-less” demonstration in favour of “freedom of association”!But the proletariat, instead of this, is drawing the massesinto a revolutionary strike, which indissolubly links poli-tics with economics, a strike which wins the support of the most backward sections by the success of the struggle for an immediate improvement in the life of the workers, and atthe same time rouses the people against the tsarist monarchy . 
 Yes, the experience of 1905 created a deep-rooted and great tradition of mass strikes. 
 And we must not forget theresults that these strikes produce in Russia. 
 Stubborn mass strikes are inseparably bound up in our country with armed uprising . 
 Let these words not be misinterpreted. 
 It is by no means a question of a call for an uprising. 
 Such a call would be most unwise at the present moment. 
 It is a question of es-tablishing the connection between strike and uprising in Russia. 
 How did the uprising grow in 1905? Firstly, mass strikes, demonstrations and meetings made clashes between the people and the police and troops more and more frequent. 
 Secondly, the mass strikes roused the peasantry to a numberof partial, fragmentary, semi-spontaneous revolts. 
 Thirdly,the mass strikes very soon spread to the Army and Navy,causing clashes on economic grounds (the “bean” and simi-lar “mutinies”), and subsequently insurrections. 
 Fourthly, the counter-revolution itself started civil war by pogroms, by violence against democrats, and so on. 
 The revolution of 1905 was defeated not because it had gone “too far”, or because the December uprising 73 was “ar-tificial”, as renegades among the liberals, and their like imagine. 
 On the contrary, the cause of the defeat was that the uprising did not go far enough , that the realisation of its necessity was not sufficiently widespread and firmly assimilated among the revolutionary classes, that the up-rising was not concerted, resolute, organised, simultaneous,aggressive. 
 Let us see now whether signs of a gathering revolt are in evidence at present. 
 In order not to be carried away by rev-olutionary enthusiasm, let us take the testimony of the Octobrists . 
 The German Union of Octobrists in St. 
 Peters-burg consists mainly of so-called “Left” and “constitutional”Octobrists, who are particularly popular among the Cadets,and who are most capable (in comparison with the otherOctobrists and Cadets) of observing events “objectively”,without making it their aim to frighten the authorities with the prospect of revolution. 
 Here is what the St. 
 -Petersburger Zeitung , the newspaper of these Octobrists, wrote in its weekly political review onMay 6 (19): “May has come. 
 Regardless of the weather, this is usually not a very pleasant month for the inhabitants of the capital, because itbegins with the proletarian ‘holiday ’. 
 This year, with the impression of the Lena demonstrations still fresh in the minds of the workers,May Day was particularly dangerous. 
 The atmosphere of the capital,saturated with all sorts of rumours about strikes and demonstrations, portended a fire. 
 Our loyal police were visibly agitated; they organised searches, arrested some persons and mobilised large forces to preventstreet demonstrations. 
 The fact that the police could think of nothingmore clever than to raid the editorial offices of the workers’ papers and arrest their editors does not testify to a particularly intimate knowledge of the wires by which the puppet regiments of the workers were pulled. 
 Yet such wires exist. 
 This is evident from the disciplined character of the strike and from many other circumstances. 
 Thatis why this May Day strike, the largest we have witnessed so far, was so ominous—there were some 100,000 or perhaps even 150,000 workers of big and small workshops on strike. 
 It was only a peacefulparade, but the solid unity of that army was remarkable, all the more because the recent unrest among the workers was accompanied by other alarming facts. 
 On various naval vessels, sailors were arrest-ed for conducting revolutionary propaganda. 
 Judging by all the information that has got into the press, the situation is not very good on our naval vessels, which are not numerous as it is .... 
 The rail-waymen are also giving cause for anxiety. 
 True, matters nowhere went so far as an attempt to call a strike, but arrests, including such a conspicuous one as that of A. 
 A. 
 Ushakov, an assistant station mas-ter on the Nikolayevskaya Railway, show that there is a certain danger there as well. 
 “Attempts at revolution on the part of immature worker masses can, of course, have only a harmful effect on the outcome of the Duma elections. 
 These attempts are all the more unreasonable because the Tsar has appointed Manukhin, and the Council of State has passedthe workers’ Insurance Bill”!! That is how a German Octobrist reasons. 
 We, on our part, must remark that we have received exact first-hand informa-tion about the sailors which proves that Novoye Vremya has exaggerated and inflated the matter. 
 The Okhrana 74 is obviously “working” in agent provocateur fashion. 
 Prema-ture attempts at an uprising would be extremely unwise. 
 The working-class vanguard must understand that the sup-port of the working class by the democratic peasantry andthe active participation of the armed forces are the mainconditions for a timely, i. 
e. 
, successful, armed uprising inRussia. 
 Mass strikes in revolutionary epochs have their objective logic. 
 They scatter hundreds of thousands and millions of sparks in all directions—and all around there is the inflam-mable material of extreme bitterness, the torture of unpre-cedented starvation, endless tyranny, shameless and cyni-cal mockery at the “pauper”, the “muzhik”, the rank-and-file soldier. 
 Add to this the perfectly unbridled, pogromist Jew-baiting carried on by the Black Hundreds and stealth-ily fostered and directed by the Court gang of the dull-witted and bloodthirsty Nicholas Romanov. 
 “So it was, soit will be” 75—these revealing words were uttered by the Minister Makarov, to his own misfortune, and to the mis-fortune of his class and his landlord tsar! The revolutionary upswing of the masses imposes great and responsible duties on every working-class Social-Demo-crat, on every honest democrat. 
 “All-round support for the movement of the masses that is beginning [we should say already: the revolutionary movement of the masses that has begun ], and its expansion on the basis of full implementa-tion of the Party slogans”—this is how the All-Russia Con-ference of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 defined these duties. 
 The Party slogans—a democratic republic, an eight-hour day, confis-cation of all the landed estates—must become the slogans of all democrats, of the people ’s revolution. 
 To be able to support and extend the movement of the masses, we need organisation and more organisation . 
 Without an illegal party we cannot carry on this work, and there is no point in just talking about it. 
 In supporting and extend-ing the onslaught of the masses, we must carefully take into account the experience of 1905, and in explaining the need for and inevitability of an uprising, we must warn againstand keep off premature attempts. 
 The growth of mass strikes, the enlistment of other classes in the struggle, the state ofthe organisations, and the temper of the masses will allsuggest of themselves the moment when all forces must unite in a concerted, resolute, aggressive, supremely courageous onslaught of the revolution on the tsarist monarchy. 
 Without a victorious revolution there will be no freedom in Russia. 
 Without the overthrow of the tsarist monarchy by a prole-tarian and peasant uprising there will be no victorious revolution in Russia.

 IN JANUARY 1912 AND THE MAY DAY MOVEMENT Elsewhere in this issue, the reader will find the full text of a leaflet printed and circulated by the St. 
 Petersburg workers before the May Day action that will from now onbe famous. 
 That leaflet is very much worth dwelling on, forit is a most important document in the history of the work-ing-class movement in Russia and in the history of our Party. 
 The leaflet reflects a certain state of disorganisation of the Social-Democratic Party in the capital, for the appeal is signed, not by the St. 
 Petersburg Committee, but by indi-vidual Social-Democratic groups and even a group of workerSocialist-Revolutionaries. 
 In most parts of Russia, the stateof our Party is such that its directing committees andcentres are constantly being arrested, and constantly re-establish themselves thanks to the existence of all kinds of factory, trade union, sub-district and district Social-Democratic groups—the very same “nuclei” that have alwaysroused the hatred of the liberals and liquidators. 
 In thelatest issue of the magazine published by those gentlemen(Nasha Zarya , 1912, No. 
 4), the reader can see again and again how Mr. 
 V. 
 Levitsky, writing with impotent rage and vomiting abuse, hisses against the “rebirth of the Party through an artificial revival of politically dead nuclei”. 
 What makes the leaflet under review all the more typical and noteworthy is the fact that, owing to the arrest of theSt. 
 Petersburg Committee, it was the nuclei that had to appear on the scene, nuclei deprived by the will of the po-lice of the “directing centre” so hateful to the liquidators. 
Owing to this fact, which every revolutionary will find sad, the independent life of the nuclei came into the open. 
 The nuclei had in all haste to rally their forces, establish con-tacts, and restore the “ underground ” in the face of fierce persecution by the police, who positively raged before MayDay. 
 The groups, representatives, etc. 
, whose names appearunder the leaflet, all constitute that very underground that is hateful to the liberals and the liquidators. 
 While the sameliquidationist leader, Mr. 
 Levitsky, speaking on behalf of Nasha Zarya and Zhivoye Dyelo , of course assailed, foaming at the mouth, the “ cult of the underground ” (see p. 
 33 of the above-mentioned issue), we had, in the shape of theSt. 
 Petersburg leaflet, a precise and complete documentrevealing to us the existence of that underground, its vital-ity, the content of its work, and its significance. 
 The St. 
 Petersburg Committee has been wiped out through the arrests, so now we shall see just what the undergroundnuclei are like in themselves, what they are doing or can do,what ideas they have actually made their own or evolved intheir midst, and not merely borrowed from the supremeParty body, what ideas really enjoy the workers’ sym-pathy. 
 The leaflet shows what the nuclei are doing: they are car-rying on the work of the St. 
 Petersburg Committee, whichfor the time being is shattered (to the delight of all the di-verse enemies of the underground). 
 They continue preparingfor May Day. 
 They hastily re-establish the contacts between different underground Social-Democratic groups. 
 They en-list worker Socialist-Revolutionaries too, for they are wellaware of the importance of uniting the proletariat rounda living revolutionary cause. 
 They rally these differentSocial-Democratic groups, and even a “group of workerSocialist-Revolutionaries”, round specific slogans of the struggle. 
 And this is when the real character of the move-ment, the real sentiment of the proletariat, the real strength of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 and of its January All-Russia Con-ference, stands out. 
 As a result of the arrests, there happens to be no hierarchic body able to decree the advancing of particular slogans. 
 Hence the proletarian masses, the worker Social-Democrats and even some of the Socialist-Revolutionaries can be unitedonly by slogans that are really indisputable for the masses, only by slogans that derive their strength not from a “decree from above” (as demagogues and liquidators put it), but from the conviction of the revolutionary workers themselves. 
 And what do we find? We find that, after the St. 
 Petersburg Committee had been shattered, at a time when its immediate restorationwas impossible, and when one group of workers influencedanother group solely by ideological, and not by organisa-tional, means, the slogans adopted were those of the All-Rus-sia Conference of the R. 
 S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 which was convened in Jan-uary 1912 and which evokes a positively mad, savage hatred on the part of the liberals, the liquidators, Lieber,Trotsky and Co. 
! “Let our slogans be,” the St. 
 Petersburg workers wrote in their leaflet, “a constituent assembly, an eight-hour working day, the confiscation of the landed estates. 
” Andfurther on the leaflet launches the call: “Down with the tsar-ist government! Down with the autocratic Constitutionof June 3! Long live the democratic republic! Long livesocialism!” We see from this instructive document that all the slo-gans put forward by the Conference of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 havebeen adopted by the St. 
 Petersburg proletariat and haveset their seal on the first steps of the new Russian revolu-tion. 
 All kinds of slanderers and detractors of the JanuaryConference may carry on their dirty business as much as they like. 
 The revolutionary proletariat of St. 
 Petersburg has answered them. 
 The work started long before the lastConference by revolutionary Social-Democrats, calling onthe proletariat to assume the role of leader of the people ’s revolution, has borne fruit despite all police persecutiondespite the reckless pre-May Day arrests and hounding of revolutionaries, despite the torrent of lies and abuse from the liberal and liquidationist press. 
 Hundreds of thousands of St. 
 Petersburg proletarians followed by workers throughout Russia, resorted to strikesand street demonstrations not as one of the separate classesof bourgeois society, not with “their own” merely eco-nomic slogans, but as the leader raising aloft the banner of the revolution for the whole people, on behalf of the whole people, and with the aim of awakening and drawing into the struggle all the classes who need freedom and are capable of striving for it. 
 The revolutionary movement of the proletariat in Russia has risen to a higher level. 
 Whereas in 1905 it began withmass strikes and Gaponiads, 76 in 1912, despite the fact that the police has smashed our Party organisations, the move-ment is beginning with mass strikes and the raising of the republican banner ! The separate “nuclei” and disconnected “groups” of workers did their duty under the most difficult and trying conditions. 
 The proletariat set up its own “MayDay committees” and went into action with a revolutionary platform worthy of the class which is destined to free man-kind from wage slavery. 
 The May Day movement also shows what meaning some words about “unity” have and how the workers unite in reality . 
 Rubanovich, a spokesman for the Socialist-Revolu-tionary Party, writes in Budushcheye , 77 Burtsev’s Paris newspaper, that “we must point out the following note-worthy feature of this May Day action: at the preparatorymeetings, St. 
 Petersburg workers refused to recognise the division existing among the various socialist groups; ... the prevailing tendency was towards agreement”. 
 The leafletwe have reprinted clearly shows what fact prompted such an inference. 
 The fact is that the Social-Democratic nuclei,which had lost their guiding centre, re-established contactwith all the various groups by winning over workers regard-less of the views they held and advocating to them all their Party slogans. 
 And precisely because these Party slogansare correct, because they are in keeping with the proletariat’srevolutionary tasks and comprise the tasks of a revolutionof the whole people, they were accepted by all workers. 
 Unity materialised because the January Conference of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 gave up the idle game of bringing about agreement among small groups abroad, gave up the idlewooing of the liquidators of the revolutionary party, andput forward clear and precise fighting slogans at the right time . 
 The proletariat’s unity for revolutionary action was achieved not by compromising between the proletarian (Social-Democratic) and the non-proletarian (Socialist-Revolutionary) parties, not by seeking agreement withthe liquidators who have broken away from the Social-Democratic Party, but by rallying the workers of Russian Social-Democratic organisations and by these workers making a correct appraisal of the tasks of the moment. 
 A good lesson for those who, succumbing to the idle chat-ter of the liberals of the Bund and the Trotskys from Viennaare still capable of believing in “unity”—with the liquida-tors. 
 The vaunted “Organising Commission” of Lieber,Trotsky and the liquidators cried out from the house-tops about “unity”, but in fact it could not, and did not, supply a single slogan actually uniting the revolutionary struggle of the workers. 
 The liquidators supplied their own , non-revo-lutionary slogans, slogans of a liberal labour policy, but themovement disregarded them. 
 That is what lies at the bot-tom of the Trotskyist fables about “unity”! Swearing and vowing that he was “unifying”, and cursing the Conference as hard as he could, Trotsky assured goodsouls in Vienna on April 23 (May 6) that “the struggle forfreedom of association is the basis ” (!!) of the Lena events and of their repercussions, that “this demand is, and willbe, the central [!!] issue of the revolutionary mobilisation of the proletariat”. 
 Scarcely a week had passed when these pitiful phrases of the yes-man of the liquidators were sweptaway like so much dust—by the “representatives of all theorganised workers of St. 
 Petersburg”, “the Social-Democrat-ic Obyedineniye group”, “the central Social-Democraticcity group”, “the group of worker Socialist-Revolutionaries “the group of worker Social-Democrats” and “the represent-atives of May Day committees”. 
 The Social-Democratic proletariat of St. 
 Petersburg has realised that a new revolutionary struggle must be started,not for the sake of one right, even though it should be themost essential, the most important for the working class, but for the sake of the freedom of the whole people . 
 The Social-Democratic proletariat of St. 
 Petersburg has realised that it must generalise its demands, and not breakthem up into parts, that the republic includes freedom ofassociation, and not vice versa, that it is necessary to strike at the centre, to attack the source of evil, to destroy the whole system, the whole regime, of the Russia of the tsarand the Black Hundreds. 
 The Social-Democratic proletariat of St. 
 Petersburg has realised that it is ridiculous and absurd to claim freedom of association from Nicholas Romanov, from the Black-Hundred Duma, that it is ridiculous and absurd to presumethat Russia’s present political system, our “autocratic Con-stitution of June 3”, is compatible with freedom of associa-tion, that in a country where there is a general and indis-criminate lack of rights, where arbitrary rule and provoca-tion by the authorities reign supreme, and where there is no “freedom” even for simply helping tens of millions of starv-ing people—it is only liberal chatterers and liberal labourpoliticians that can put freedom of association as “the cen-tral issue of revolutionary mobilisation”. 
 The Social-Democratic proletariat of St. 
 Petersburg has realised that and unfurled the republican banner, demanding an eight-hour day and confiscation of the landed estates asthe only guarantee of the truly democratic character of therevolution. 
 Sotsial -Demokrat No. 
 27, Published according June 17 (4), 1912 to the text in Sotsial -Demokrat THE LIQUIDATORS OPPOSE REVOLUTIONARY MASS STRIKES The leading article of this issue had already gone to press when we received the first issue of the liquidationist Nevsky Golos . 
 V. 
 Yezhov, the well-known liquidator of Nasha Zarya at once presented the new organ with such a gem that one isleft gasping! Here it is, if you please: “Owing to this [i. 
e. 
, owing to the variety of the strikes, which in some cases did not go beyond a protest against the imposition of fines for celebrating May Day, while in other cases they supplement-ed the protest with economic demands, etc. 
], the principle involvedin the protest (after all, it was not over a few kopeks that the strikewas called) became obscured [ !??!] in a considerable number of cases being complicated by economic demands.... 
 “Their own experience should have suggested to the workers that it was inadvisable [!!] to com plicate their protest by economic de-mands, just as it is inadvisable to complicate [!?] an ordinary strike “It is necessary to give organisational form to the sentiments of the worker masses. 
 It is necessary to increase propaganda for tradeunions, to recruit new members for them. 
 This is all the more neces-sary since there are many hotheads among the workers nowadays who are carried away by the mass movement and speak at meetingsagainst unions , alleging them to be useless and unnecessary “A period of economic strikes [only economic?] is ahead of us. 
 It would be an irreparable mistake to allow them to become inter-twined with political actions of the workers [!!!]. 
 Such a combination would have a harmful effect [ !!??] on both the economic and the political struggle. 
” Here you have the perfectly liberal Mr. 
 Severyanin copied by the liquidator! Utter incomprehension of the fact that arevolutionary mass strike necessarily combines the economic with the political strike; narrow-mindedness, a monstrous distortion of the revolutionary character of the upswing and attempts to measure it by the yardstick of “ordinary strikes”; the most reactionary advice “not to complicate” politics with economics and not to “intertwine” them; and the using of the legally published press for an attack in thespirit of Struve and Maklakov against the revolutionaryworker Social-Democrats, who are described as “hotheads”speaking out “against unions”! A liberal cannot understand a revolutionary Social-Dem-ocrat except as one who is “against unions”. 
 But the work-ers at the meetings were, of course, not “against unions”,but against substituting liberal slogans for revolutionary ones, which is what Mr. 
 Yezhov and Co. 
 are doing. 
 Ourslogan is not freedom of association, said the workers, and“trade unions” are not the only, nor the chief, means of “giv-ing” our movement “organisational form”. 
 Our slogan is the demand for a republic (see the appeal of the St. 
 Petersburgworkers), we are building an illegal party capable of leading the revolutionary onslaught of the masses upon the tsaristmonarchy. 
 That is what the workers said at the meetings. 
 But the Liebers and Trotskys are assuring the workers that it is possible for the Social-Democratic proletariat and its Party to “unite” with liberals à la Yezhov, Potresov and Co.

, are join-ing the ranks of the Social-Democratic Party. 
 And this isthe time when our liquidators are out to “unite” with the P. 
S. 
P. 
 Left wing! It is just as if the Russian Social-Democrats began, inde-pendently of the Bund, to “unite” with, say so-called“Socialist-Zionists” 79 or, ignoring the Lettish Social-Democ-racy, with the so-called “Lettish Social-Democratic Union”80 (actually a Socialist-Revolutionary organisation). 
 This is apart from the formal aspect of the matter. 
 At the Stockholm Congress, the Polish Social-Democratic Partyconcluded an agreement with the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
, by whichany groups in Poland wishing to join the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 can doso only by joining an organisation of the P. 
S. 
D. 
 81 And at the All-Russia Conference of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 held in December 1908, even a proposal to discuss the question of uniting with the Left wing was voted down by an overwhelmingmajority. 
 It is quite clear that, while constantly shouting about “unity”, Trotsky and his liquidationist friends are actually aggravating the split in Poland. 
 Fortunately for the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
, this whole band of liquidators, together withthe “conciliators” trailing behind them, is completelypowerless to accomplish anything in practice , and this refers to Poland as well. 
 Otherwise the amalgamation of the liqui-dators with the P. 
S. 
P. 
 would certainly cause a very sharp split in Poland. 
 Why, then, have the liquidators embarked on this obvi-ously adventurist policy? Certainly not because things aregoing well with them. 
 The point is that they are in need ofuniting with someone, of forming some sort of “party”. 
Social-Democrats, the Polish Social-Democracy, refuse to go along with them, so, instead of Social-Democrats, they have to take members of the P. 
S. 
P. 
, who have nothingin common with our Party. 
 In the Russian towns, our oldParty organisations refuse to go along with them, so theyhave to take, instead of the Social-Democratic nuclei, theso-called “initiating groups” of liquidators, who have noth-ing in common with the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 “One does not fly from a good life. 
” Is it not time, liqui-dator gentlemen, you started to unite with the Socialist-Revolutionaries (the Socialist-Revolutionary liquidators ) as well? After all, these gentlemen, too, seem very anxiousto “unite”. 
 What a “broad” party you would then have! Larin himself would be content. 
 82 * * * While “uniting” with “foreign powers”, the liquidators continue to bargain with the “conciliators” over the terms of “uniting” the liquidator-conciliator camp. 
 Mr. 
 V. 
 Levitsky contributed to Nasha Zarya an article which is a sort of manifesto addressed to “all trends” that are pre-pared to fight against the recent Conference of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 Mr. 
 Levitsky entitled his article “For Unity—Against a Split”. 
 Quite like Trotsky, isn’t it? Ever since the pro-Party elements thoroughly rebuffed the liquidators in all the spheres of activity, Levitsky and Co. 
 have been usinga very “conciliatory” language. 
 Why, they are wholly in favour of “unity”. 
 They only advance the following four modest conditions for “unity”: (1) A fight against the Conference of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 which has united all the Social-Democrats, except a handfulof waverers. 
 (2) The formation, in place of the Party, of “ a central initiating group ” (Mr. 
 Levitsky’s italics, Nasha Zarya No. 
 4 p. 
 31). 
 (What is meant by the liquidators’ “initiating” groups has recently been explained in the press by Plekhanov— see his Dnevnik Sotsial-Demokrata 83 No. 
 16. 
 Both the Bund and Trotsky, who are doing service for the liquidators, areconcealing Plekhanov’s explanation from their readers. 
 Butyou can’t conceal it, gentlemen!) (3) No revival of the “ politically dead nuclei ” (ibid. 
, p. 
 33). 
 (4) Acceptance of the slogan “ against the cult of the un-derground ” (ibid. 
, p. 
 33). 
 The programme has been outlined clearly enough if not as frankly and confidently as in the past. 
 And there andthen Levitsky explains at great length to all the Trotskys: After all, gentlemen, you have no choice. 
 You had better accept our terms, and in exchange we (i. 
e. 
, Levitsky andCo. 
) will readily agree to the following: “to console your-selves”, you (i. 
e. 
, Trotsky and his like) can say that it is notyou who have moved closer to the liquidators, but theother way round. 
 Martov, writing in the same issue of Nasha Zarya , threat-ens in advance the future Social-Democratic group in theFourth Duma that if it turns out to be anti-liquidationistlike its crafty predecessor, then “cases like the Belousovaffair 84 will not be exceptions, but the rule”, meaning, in plain language, that the liquidators will split the Duma group. 
 Your bark, liquidator gentlemen, is worse than your bite. 
 Had you had the strength to do so, you would longago have formed your own liquidationist group in the Duma. 
 The cause of “unity” is in good hands, sure enough. 
The miserable comedy of “unification” enacted by the liquidators and Trotsky is repellent to the least exacting people. 
 Unity is being achieved, only it is not unity with the liquidators, but against them. 
 * * * As regards the incredibly Khlestakovian85 role staged by Trotsky, Lieber (the Bund), and the liquidators, with theirvaunted “Organising Commission”, we think it sufficient tocall the attention of the readers—those who prefer not totrust words but to verify the points at issue by a serious and careful study of the documents—to the following facts . 
 In June 1911, following the withdrawal of Lieber and Igorev from the meeting of the Central Committee members,the Organising Commission Abroad 86 was formed in Paris. 
 The first organisation in Russia to be approached by it wasthe Kiev organisation. 
 Even Trotsky admits that its status as an organisation is indisputable. 
 In October 1911, the Kiev organisation took part in forming the OrganisingCommission in Russia. 
 In January 1912 the latter convenedthe conference of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 In January 1912, a meeting was held by the representa-tives of the Bund, the Central Committee of the Letts and the Caucasian Regional Committee (all three being liquida-tionist groups). 
 The Poles withdrew at once , declaring that the whole undertaking was a liquidationist affair. 
 The con-ciliators” and Plekhanov followed suit and refused to join , Plekhanov declaring in Dnevnik Sotsial-Demokrata No. 
 16 that that conference was being called by the liquidators . 
 It is now June 1912, and yet neither the Bund nor Trotsky have succeeded in “uniting” anyone , except the Golos and the Vperyod groups; they have not won over a single serious and indisputable organisation in Russia, have not said a word to deny the substance of Plekhanov’s statement, normade the slightest change in the propaganda conducted by the liquidators in Nasha Zarya and similar press organs. 
 For all that, there is no end of phrase-mongering andbragging about “unity”. 
 Sotsial -Demokrat No. 
 27, Published according June 17 (4), 1912 to the text in Sotsial -Demokrat THE NATURE AND SIGNIFICANCE OF OUR POLEMICS AGAINST THE LIBERALS Mr. 
 Prokopovich, a well-known advocate of revisionism and of a liberal labour policy, contributed to Russkiye Ve-domosti an article entitled “Danger Ahead”. 
 The danger, according to this politician, is that the elections to theFourth Duma will be shaped by the police chiefs. 
 To com-bat this danger, he proposes “the unity of all the constitu-tionalist elements of the country”, i. 
e. 
, the Social-Democratsand the Trudoviks, as well as the Cadets and the Progressists. 
 The Right-Cadet Russkiye Vedomosti in an editorial note declares its “ satisfaction ” with Mr. 
 Prokopovich’s article. 
 “Such unity of the opposition forces,” it says, “we regardas an urgent requirement of the present moment. 
” The official-Cadet Rech gives a summary of Mr. 
 Prokopo-vich’s article and, quoting the opinion of Russkiye Vedomo-sti, comments for its own part: “However, judging by the publications of the Social-Democratic trend, which bend all their energies mostly to fight the opposition,one can hardly attach any real importance to this appeal” (i. 
e. 
, theappeal for “unity”). 
 Thus the important question of the election tactics and the attitude of the workers to the liberals is being raisedonce more. 
 Once again we see that the liberals pose thisquestion not like serious politicians, but like matchmak-ers. 
 Their aim is not to establish the truth, but to obscure it. 
 Indeed, ponder over the following circumstance. 
 Do the liberals mean amalgamation of the parties when they speakof “unity”? Not in the least. 
 Mr. 
 Prokopovich, Russkiye Vedomosti and Rech are all agreed on this score. 
 Consequently, what they mean by unity is joint action against the Rights—from Purishkevich to Guchkov—is it not? It would seem that is so! The question arises: does anyone among the “Lefts” reject such joint action? No one does. 
 That is common knowledge. 
An agreement with the liberals to vote against the Rights is precisely what is meant by “unity” between the demo-crats and the liberals in the elections. 
 Why, then, are the liberals dissatisfied? Why do they not say that the “Lefts”have quite definitely and explicitly declared in favour ofagreements? Why are they so shy of mentioning the factthat it is the liberals who have said nothing clear, definite, explicit and official about agreements with the Lefts, with the democrats, with the Marxists? Why is it that, in speak-ing of the election tactics, they do not say a word about the well-known decision of the Cadet conference, which per-mitted of blocs with the “Left Octobrists”? The facts are there, gentlemen, and no amount of dodg-ing can alter them. 
 It is the Lefts, the Marxists, that have declared, clearly, explicitly and officially, in favour of an agreement with the liberals (including both the Cadetsand the Progressists) against the Rights. 
 And it is none other than the Cadets who have evaded a quite explicit and official answer regarding the Lefts! Mr. 
 Prokopovich knows these facts very well, and it is therefore absolutely unpardonable on his part to distort the truth by keeping silent about the explicit decision ofthe Marxists and the evasiveness of the Cadets. 
 What is the reason for this silence? It is only too obvious from the quoted statement of Rech alleging that we “bend all our energies mostly to fight the opposition”. 
 From the wording used by Rech , it follows inevitably that if they want to unite with the liberals, the democrats must not “bend all their energies” to fight the opposition. 
 But in that case say so plainly, gentlemen! State your terms explic-itly and officially. 
 The trouble with you, however, is thatyou cannot do so. 
 You would merely make everyone laugh if you tried to formulate such a condition. 
 By putting forward such a condition you would refute yourselves, foryou have all of you unanimously admitted that there are “profound differences ” between the liberals and the demo-crats (to say nothing of the Marxists). 
 And since there are differences, and profound ones at that, how is it possible to avoid fighting? The falsity of the liberals is precisely that, on the one hand, they reject amalgamation, acknowledge the existenceof profound differences, emphasise that it is impossible“for any of the parties to renounce the fundamental provi-sions of its programme” ( Russkiye Vedomosti ), and, on the other hand, they complain of the “fight against the opposi-tion”!! But let us examine the matter more closely. 
 To begin with, is it true that the newspapers and magazines, to whichRech refers, bend all their energies mostly to fight the oppo-sition? No, far from it. 
 The liberals cannot point to a single question, not one, in which the democrats do not bend all their energies mostly to fight the Rights!! Let anyone of you who wishes to check this statement make a test. 
 Let himtake any, say, three successive issues of any Marxist newspa-per. 
 Let him take three political questions as test cases and compare the documentary data showing against whom the fight of the Marxists on the questions selected is mostly“directed” in those newspaper issues. 
 You will not make that simple and easy test, liberal gen-tlemen, because any such test will prove you wrong. 
 Nor is that all. 
 There is another, and particularly impor-tant, consideration which refutes you even more strongly. 
 How do the democrats in general, and the Marxists in par-ticular, carry on their fight against the liberals? They carry it on in such a way, and only in such a way, that each—positively and absolutely each—reproach or accusationlevelled at the liberals naturally involves an even sharper reproach, an even graver accusation levelled at the Rights. 
 That is the gist of the matter, the crux of the issue! A few examples will make our idea quite clear. 
 We accuse the liberals, the Cadets, of being counter-revolutionary. 
 Show us a single one of our accusations of this kind that does not reflect with even greater force upon the Rights. 
 We accuse the liberals of “nationalism” and “imperial-ism”. 
 Show us a single one of our accusations of this kind /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR that is not directed with even greater force against the Rights. 
 We have accused the liberals of being afraid of the move-ment of the masses. 
 Now can you find in our newspapers aformulation of this accusation such as is not directed againstthe Rights as well? We have accused the liberals of defending “certain” me-dieval institutions that are capable of “operating” against the workers. 
 To accuse the liberals of that means accusing thereby all the Rights of the same thing, and of even more. 
 These examples can be multiplied indefinitely. 
 You will find that always and everywhere, without any exception,the working-class democrats accuse the liberals exclusivelyfor being close to the Rights, for the irresolute and fictitious nature of their fight against the Rights, for their half-heartedness, thereby accusing the Rights, not merely of “half a sin”, but of a “whole sin”. 
 “The fight against the liberals” waged by the democrats and the Marxists is more profound, more consistent andricher in content, and it does more to enlighten and rally the masses, than the fight against the Rights . 
 That, gentle-men, is how matters stand! And in order not to leave any doubts on this score, in order to forestall any absurd distortion of the meaning andsignificance of our fight against the liberals—to forestall,for example, the absurd theory of “one reactionary mass” (i. 
e. 
, the lumping together of the liberals and the Rights in the single political concept of a reactionary bloc, of areactionary mass)—we always take care, in our official state-ments, to speak of the fight against the Rights in termsdifferent from those we use in speaking of our fight against the liberals. 
 Mr. 
 Prokopovich knows this very well, as does every edu-cated liberal. 
 He knows, for instance, that in our definitionof the social, class nature of the various parties, we alwaysstress the medievalism of the Rights and the bourgeois na-ture of the liberals. 
 And there is a world of difference be-tween these two things. 
 Medievalism can (and should) be destroyed, even keeping within the framework of capitalism. 
 Bourgeois nature cannot be destroyed within this frame-work, but we can (and should) “appeal” from the bourgeois landlord to the bourgeois peasant, from the bourgeois liberal to the bourgeois democrat, from bourgeois half freedom to bourgeois full freedom. 
 It is in such appeals, and only in such appeals, that our criticism of the liberals con-sists during the period Russia is passing through, i. 
e. 
, thecriticism which we are voicing from the standpoint of theimmediate and next tasks of this period. 
 Take the following statement in Mr. 
 Prokopovich’s arti-cle. 
 “The creation of sound conditions for the political life of the mass of the people—this is the immediate aim whichat present unites the Lefts and the opposition. 
” Nothing could be more meaningless, more empty and misleading than this statement. 
 Even an Octobrist, even anastute “nationalist”, will subscribe to it, because it is so vague. 
 It is a mere promise, sheer declamation, diplomatic concealment of one’s thoughts. 
 But if Mr. 
 Prokopovich,like so many other liberals, has been given a tongue so thathe may conceal his thoughts, we shall try to do our duty andreveal what is concealed behind his statement. 
 To be on thesafe side, let us take a minor example, something of rather little importance. 
 Is the two-chamber system a sound condition for political life? We do not think so. 
 The Progressists and the Cadetsthink it is. 
 For holding such views, we accuse the liberalsof being anti-democratic, of being counter-revolutionary. 
And by formulating this accusation against the liberals, we level an even greater accusation at all the Rights. 
 Further, the question arises: How about “unity between the Lefts and the opposition”? Do we, on account of thisdifference of opinion, refuse to unite with a liberal againsta Right? By no means. 
 The counter-revolutionary viewsof the liberals on this question, as well as on all similar, much more important questions of political liberty, have been known to us for a long time—since 1905 or even earlier. 
Nevertheless, we repeat even in 1912 that both in a secondballot and at the second stage of the elections it is permis-sible to enter into agreements with the liberals against theRights. 
 For, despite its half-heartedness, bourgeois monarch-ist liberalism is not at all the same as feudal reaction. 
 It would be very bad working-class politics not to take advan-tage of this difference. 
 But to proceed. 
 How should we take advantage of it? On what terms is “unity between the Lefts and the opposi-tion” possible? The answer of the liberal is: since the Lefts are waging a relentless fight against the opposition, there isno point in even talking of unity. 
 And the liberal goes onto explain his idea as follows: the more modest the demand,the wider is the circle of those who agree with it, the morecomplete is the unity, and the greater the force capable of implementing that demand. 
 A “tolerable” constitution providing for a two-chamber system (and other—how shallwe put it mildly?—slight digressions from democracy) willhave the support of all democrats and all liberals; thatis a great deal. 
 But if you insist on “pure” democracy, theProgressists will drop out, and you will also “alienate” many Cadets, with the result that the “constitutionalist elements” will be disunited and weakened. 
 That is how the liberal reasons. 
 But we reason differently. 
 Our main premise is that unless the masses are politicallyconscious there can be no change for the better. 
 The liberallooks to the upper ranks, while we look to the “lower ranks”. 
 If we refrain from explaining the harm of the two-chamber system, or even relax ever so slightly the “fight” againstall sorts of anti-democratic views on this question, we may“attract” the liberal landlord, merchant, lawyer, professor,who are all of a feather with Purishkevich, and can do noth-ing serious against the Purishkeviches. 
 By “attracting” them, we alienate the masses—in the sense that the masses, to whom democracy is not just a diplomatic signboard, nota showy phrase, but their own vital cause, a question oflife and death, would lose their confidence in the partisansof the two-chamber system; and also in the sense that relax-ing the attacks on the two-chamber system implies inade-quate political education of the masses, and unless the masses are politically conscious, wide-awake and full of deter-mination, no changes for the better can be brought about. 
 The Cadets and the Prokopoviches tell us that by our polemics against the liberal we are driving a wedge betweenthe Lefts and the opposition. 
 Our answer is that consistent democracy repels the most wavering and unreliable liberals, those most tolerant to Purishkevichism—and they representa mere handful; on the other hand, it attracts the millions now awakening to a new life, to a “sound political life”, by which we mean something quite different from, something that is not at all the same as, that which Mr. 
 Prokopovich means by it. 
 Instead of the two-chamber system, we might cite as an example the question of the composition of the land commit-tees Should influence in these committees be so divided as,to give one-third to the landlords, one-third to the peasants and one-third to the bureaucrats, as the Cadets propose, or should they be elected quite freely, on the basis of a fully democratic electoral law? What, Mr. 
 Prokopovich, are weto understand, in regard to this point, by “sound conditionsfor the political life of the mass of the people”? Whom willwe repel and whom will we attract by adhering to a consist-ently democratic course on this question? And let not Russkiye Vedomosti reply that “at present one point dominates over all the other points of the pro-gramme, a point common to all the progressive parties—thedemand for political liberty”. 
 Precisely because this pointdominates —and this is, indisputable, it is gospel truth— there is a need for the widest masses, for millions upon millions of people, to distinguish between half freedom andfreedom and to see the indissoluble connection betweenpolitical democracy and democratic agrarian reform. 
 Unless, the masses are interested, politically conscious, wide awake, active, determined and independent, absolute-ly nothing can be accomplished in either sphere.

 CAPITALISM AND “PARLIAMENT ” The facts of democracy must not make us lose sight of a circumstance, often overlooked by bourgeois democrats,that in the capitalist countries representative institutions inevitably give rise to specific forms in which capital exer-cises its influence on the state power. 
 We have no parliament,but then there is no end of parliamentary cretinism amongthe liberals and of parliamentary licence among all the bour-geois deputies. 
 The workers must thoroughly master this truth if they want to learn how to use representative institutions for promoting the political consciousness, unity, activity andefficiency of the working class. 
 All the social forces hostileto the proletariat—the “bureaucrats”, landowners and cap-italists—are already using these representative institutionsagainst the workers. 
 One has to know how they are doing this if one wants to learn to uphold the independent inter-ests of the working class and its independent development. 
 The Third Duma decided to award bonuses to home manu-facturers of machinery. 
 Who are these home manufacturers?The ones “operating” in Russia! But upon examination we find that they are foreign cap-italists who have transferred their plants to Russia. 
 Tariff rates are high and profits immense, so foreign capital ismoving into Russia. 
 For instance, an American trust—a corporation of capitalist millionaires—has built a hugefarm machinery works in Lyubertsi, near Moscow. 
 In Khar-kov, farm machines are made by the capitalist Melhose and in Berdyansk by the capitalist John Grieves. 
 These manu-facturers are very much of the “truly Russian”, “home” va-riety, aren’t they? But, of course, unless they were helped in every way by Russian capitalists, they would have been unable to operate in Russia at all. 
 One good turn deserves another. 
 Ameri-can, British and German capitalists rake in profits withthe help of Russian capitalists, who get quite a big share. 
Take, for example, the Lena gold-fields or the mining enter-prises in the Urals. 
 How many millions foreign and Russiancapitalists have shared between them there! The Duma is very useful to the industrialists in this re-spect. 
 Both in the Duma and in the Council of State, thecapitalists have a goodly number of representatives. 
 Thelandlords, too, would not amount to much nowadays with-out capital. 
 For both the capitalists and the landlords,the Duma is a ready-made machinery for passing laws on “bonuses” (to be awarded to themselves ), protective tariffs (i. 
e. 
, another form of bonuses to themselves), concessions(a third form of bonuses to themselves), and so on, without limit . 
 The “Sceptic”, a liberal writing in the liberal Rech , had some very apt comments to make on this matter. 
 He writes with so much feeling against the “nationalists” (who award-ed themselves “bonuses” to stimulate the “home” manufac-ture of machinery by Messrs. 
 Grieves, Melhose, Elworthy,and other companies) that I, too, have become somewhatinfected with scepticism. 
 Yes, the liberal “Sceptic” has not made a bad job of ex-posing the “nationalists”. 
 But why does he say nothing about the Cadets? When Golovin, for instance, was seekinga concession, did not his position as member of the Duma and former Chairman of the Duma stand him in good steadin that useful and lucrative pursuit? When Maklakov was gobbling up his “Tagiyev” fees, did not his position as member of the Duma make it easier for him to get such “profitable” cases? 87 And what about the numerous other Cadet landlords, merchants, capitalists, financiers, lawyers and brokers whoextended their business, promoted their “connections”, andput through their “affairs”, thanks to their position as mem-bers of the Duma and to the benefits and advantages that position affords? What if an inquiry were made into financial transactions carried out by Duma members or with the aid of Duma mem-bers? But no—in all capitalist countries measures have been taken to protect “trade secrets” and to guarantee that not a single “parliament” should permit such an inquiry. 
 However, the working-class deputies undoubtedly know a great deal about this matter; and if they took pains to lookaround, obtain additional information, collect material, look up newspaper files, inquire at the stock exchange, etc. 
, they could themselves carry out a very instructive and useful“inquiry” into the business transactions carried out by Duma members or with the aid of such members. 
 In European parliaments, such transactions are well known, and the workers constantly expose them, naming the persons involved, so as to enlighten the people. 
 Nevskaya Zvezda No. 
 13, Published according to June 17, 1912 to the text in Nevskaya Zvezda Signed: A Non-Liberal Sceptic THE ELECTIONS AND THE OPPOSITION Marxists long ago defined their fundamental attitude to the elections. 
 The Right-wing parties—from Purishkevichto Guchkov—the liberal-monarchist bourgeoisie (Cadets and Progressists) and the democrats (worker democrats and bourgeois democrats, i. 
e. 
, Trudoviks) are the three principal camps contesting the elections. 
 The distinction betweenthese camps is a basic one, for they represent differentclasses and have entirely different programmes and tactics. 
Correct practical conclusions regarding the election cam-paign can only be drawn if the principles on which each of the three camps bases its policy are clearly understood. 
 The Marxists fully established these points * about six months ago, and since then they have been proved correctabove all by the utterances of the liberal opposition. 
 Our“neighbours and enemies on the right”, while by no means sharing our views, have with commendable zeal provided us with the best confirmation of the correctness of our points. 
We may proclaim the following law: the development of Cadet political activity and political views provides excel-lent evidence in support of Marxist views. 
 Or, in other words:when a Cadet begins to speak, you may rest assured that he will refute the views of liberal labour politicians no less effectively than a Marxist. 
 That is why, incidentally, it is doubly useful for the work-ers to look closely into Cadet policy: first of all, they willget to know the liberal bourgeois very well and, secondly,they will learn to see more clearly the mistakes made by certain supporters of the working class. 
 *See present edition, Vol. 
 17, pp. 
 397-402. 
— Ed. 
 It is this doubly useful result that one may well expect from the recent comments of Rech on the important pre-election statements made by Russkiye Vedomosti . 
 These are statements by Mr. 
 Akimov (V. 
 Makhnovets), an old Econ-omist, i. 
e. 
, an opportunist of the period 1897-1902. 
 Theyamount to a straightforward defence of the “progressivebloc”, whose “platform” (a platform that, by the way, hasnot been published!) Mr. 
 Akimov, who chooses to call him-self a Social-Democrat, considers “perfectly acceptable for the Social-Democrats”. 
 We have been, and are still being, told by numerous political babes (from Paris to Krasnoyarsk) and seasoneddiplomats (from Vienna to Vilna), 88 that a liberal labour policy is a “bogey”. 
 But take a look at Mr. 
 Akimov, my dear opponents! You will probably be unable to deny that Akimov is an obvious embodiment of liberal labour policy. 
Nor will you be able to say that he is unique, i. 
e. 
, that heis an isolated phenomenon and an inimitable rarity, the onlyone of its kind. 
 For, numerous though Mr. 
 Akimov’s inimi-table qualities are, he is not an isolated phenomenon, and it would be a downright untruth to say he is. 
 He made his statement after and in the same vein as Mr. 
 Prokopovich. 
He found for himself a widely circulated liberal paper,a convenient rostrum from which his speeches carry far. 
He obtained a “good press” among the liberal journalists. 
Oh, no, he is not an isolated phenomenon. 
 It does not mat-ter that he ceased long ago to belong to any group. 
 It does not matter that his right to the name of Social-Democratis absolutely fictitious. 
 But he represents a political line which has roots, which is living and, though it often goesinto hiding, invariably comes into the open when there is the slightest revival of political activity. 
 Rech “gives full credit to the sober realism” of Mr. 
 Aki-mov’s arguments, and stresses with especial pleasure hisopinion that “the Social-Democrats should at present putforward those of their political aims that will have the sup-port of sufficiently large, politically strong sections of thepeople”. 
 Rech certainly has good reason to rejoice. 
 What Nasha Zarya says with a thousand twists and turns, piling one lit-tle reservation on another, covering up its tracks, and flaunt-ing pseudo-Marxist catchwords that have long become out-worn, Mr. 
 Akimov blurts out bluntly and rather brusquely, rather simply, with a naïveté verging on innocence. 
 From a formal point of view, Nasha Zarya and Nevsky Golos are perfectly in a position, of course, to disclaim all responsibility for Mr. 
 Akimov. 
 But what actually hap-pens is that the general reader, who is not versed in finepoints and is not interested in them, derives “Akimovism”, and nothing but “Akimovism”, from these liquidationist publications. 
 “Don’t wreck the Progressist cause,” wroteMartov. 
 “Put forward those aims” that will have the sup-port of the Progressists , writes Akimov, who, naturally, makes the reservation that the non-partisanship of the Pro-gressists makes it easier for any party to maintain its in-dependence (on paper). 
 To put forward more aims than are acceptable to the Progressists means precisely to “wreck”their cause—this is how Martov’s slogan is interpreted bythe actual political struggle, by the crowd which Akimov represents so well. 
 Akimov is convinced that the Cadets and Progressists constitute “large and politically strong sections of the peo-ple”. 
 This is just the sort of liberal untruth about whichNevskaya Zvezda wrote in a recent article on the nature and significance of the Marxists’ polemics against the liberals. 
 * In reality, however, the liberal-monarchist bourgeoisie,taken as a whole, comprising the Cadets, the Progressists and many others, is a very small section of the people and one that is remarkably weak politically. 
 The bourgeoisie can never constitute a large section of the people. 
 As for being politically strong, it can be and isthat in a whole series of capitalist countries, but not inPrussia or Russia. 
 In these two countries, its amazing, monstrous, all but incredible political impotence is fully explained by the fact that the bourgeoisie here is far moreafraid of revolution than it is of reaction. 
 Political impo-tence is an inevitable result of this. 
 And all talk about the“political strength” of the bourgeoisie is thoroughly false,and consequently good for nothing at all, if it avoids this fundamental feature of the state of affairs in Russia.

 Mr. 
 Akimov has come out as a most outspoken and mod-erate liberal. 
 We regard you as a force, Cadet and Progressist gentlemen, he says. 
 We fully accept your platform (although there is no such platform!) and we ourselves are now puttingforward those aims that have your support. 
 All we ask of you is “that the list of the [Progressist] bloc should includethe Social-Democrats”. 
 This is what Akimov wrote, wordfor word! I will accept everything, anything, he says, if only you include me in the liberal list! It was truly ungracious of Rech t o decline even so moderate a request. 
 After all, it is a question of the June Third voters,the Cadets remind Akimov. 
 And what do the Social-Demo-crats amount to among them ? Nothing, “with the exception of the big cities, of which there is no question”. 
 And the official Cadet newspaper condescendingly teaches the hum-ble and docile Akimov: “Apart from the border regions,they [the Social-Democrats] will almost everywhere elsehave to be guided, not by the hope of putting up candidatesof their own, but by considerations making for the victoryof the progressive bloc over the reactionary bloc of the op-pressors of the people. 
” The liberal has brusquely declined to take the hand hum-bly proffered by the liberal labour politician! A well-deservedreward for refusing to fight in the big cities. 
 The big ci-ties belong to us because we are strong, say the Cadets, andthe rest of Russia belongs to us because the June Third men and their June Third law, which guarantees our monopoly of opposition, are strong too. 
 Not a bad reply. 
 The lesson which Akimov has been taught is a cruel but useful one.

 THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ST. 
 PETERSBURG ELECTIONS According to newspaper reports, the question of the date when the Fourth Duma should be convened and of the time when elections to it should be held has aroused some doubts among the ruling circles. 
 Some were in favour of postpon-ing the convening of the Duma until January, while othersdeclared for October. 
 Now the question is said to have beendecided in favour of the latter opinion. 
 Thus the elections are quite near at hand—a mere seven to nine weeks. 
 We must take steps to redouble our efforts with regard to all aspects of our pre-election work. 
 I should like to deal in this article with a special question, which, however, has acquired very great general impor-tance for the worker democrats. 
 I mean the role of the St. 
Petersburg elections. 
 The elections in St. 
 Petersburg’s second urban curia are the focal point of the entire Fourth Duma election campaign. 
 Only in St. 
 Petersburg is there a tolerably well organised working-class press, one which, for all the fierce persecutionit is subjected to, for all the fines and the arrests of its edi-tors, for all the instability of its position, and for all that it is kept down by the censorship, is able to reflect, to some little degree, the views of worker democrats. 
 In the absence of a daily press, the elections remain an obscure matter, and their significance in terms of the polit-ical enlightenment of the masses is reduced by half, if notmore. 
 For this reason, the St. 
 Petersburg elections acquire the significance of a model of the election campaign which work-er democrats have to undertake in the incredibly difficult conditions of Russian reality. 
 Nowhere else are the workers in a position to hold an election campaign visible to every-one. 
 To be sure, the elections in the worker curia are highly important, but there the workers cannot come up againstthe other classes of the population, and therefore cannotpresent on an adequate scale the national demands, and the views on the tasks involved in a common policy , which have been worked out by the progressive, proletarian demo-crats, so that they may serve all democrats in general as a guide. 
 In St. 
 Petersburg the elections are direct. 
 Hence the pre-election struggle here may take much more definite, moredistinct and more partisan forms than elsewhere. 
 The otherbig cities would have been as important as St. 
 Petersburg, but administrative pressure in the provinces is still s o much stronger than in the capital that it is difficult forworker democrats to force their way through, to get a hear-ing. 
 Lastly, in St. 
 Petersburg the struggle in the second curia has to take place between the liberals and the democrats. 
 The Cadets consider the second curia to be their domain. 
 St. 
 Petersburg is represented by Milyukov, Rodichev andKutler. 
 Obviously, the fact that a fairly large number of demo-cratic voters are represented by the liberals can by no meansbe considered normal. 
 The elections to the Second Duma showed that Cadet “domination” among the democratic urban voters is very far from being solid. 
 In St. 
 Petersburgitself, the “Left bloc” in the Second Duma elections, i. 
e. 
,the bloc of worker and bourgeois democrats (Narodniks),not only could , but certainly would , have won, if at that time Mensheviks like Dan and Co. 
 had not split the workers’ election campaign and thereby given rise, among the Na-rodniks, to wavering and vacillations that were exceedinglyharmful to the success of the cause. 
 One has only to recallthat in the Second Duma elections even the “Socialist-Revolutionaries” followed the Mensheviks’ lead to the lastminute, defending their bloc with the Cadets! The electoral law now in force permits of a second ballot, so that no blocs are required, or permissible, at the firststage. 
 The struggle in St. 
 Petersburg will be between the worker democrats and the liberals. 
 The Narodniks will hardly be strong enough to act independently—they have been “liq-uidating” themselves much too zealously by following ourliquidators’ line. 
 The worker democrats are therefore almostcertain to be supported by the bourgeois democrats (Tru-doviks and Narodniks), if not at the first stage of the elec-tion, then at any rate when a second ballot is taken. 
 The liberals have their leader, Mr. 
 Milyukov, from St. 
 Petersburg. 
 They have had a large following so far. 
 Thefunds which the liberal-monarchist bourgeoisie suppliesthem with, the propaganda weapons in the form of two dailynewspapers, and an organisation which is virtually toleratedand all but legalised de facto , all afford the Cadets tremen-dous advantages. 
 On the workers’ side are the mass of the workers, con-sistent and sincere democracy, energy and devotion to thecause of socialism and working-class democracy. 
 The workerscan win if they rely on these forces and if they have a work-ers’ daily newspaper. 
 The workers’ struggle for seats in the Duma for St. 
 Petersburg is undoubtedly acquiring a vast and country-wide significance in the entire Fourth Duma election campaign. 
 Those who like to talk of “unity” of the whole opposition— from the Progressists and Cadets to the warily dodgingliquidator Martov and the crudely simple-minded Prokopo-vich and Akimov—are all at pains to evade the issue of the St. 
 Petersburg elections or to leave it out. 
 They bypassthe political centre but readily make their way into whatmay be called the political backwoods. 
 They speak volubly,fervently and eloquently of what will be opportune atthe second stage of the elections, i. 
e. 
, when the principal, the chief, the decisive, part of the election campaign is over, and they “are eloquently silent” about St. 
 Petersburg,which has been won by the Cadets and which has to bewon back from them, has to be restored to the democrats. 
 There were no democratic deputies for St. 
 Petersburg under the law of December 11, 1905, nor under that of June 3, 1907, 89 so that “restored” would seem to be an unsuitable term. 
 But St. 
 Petersburg belongs to the democrats by virtueof the entire course of the entire emancipation movement in First page of Nevskaya Zvezda No.

 15, July 1, 1912, in which Lenin’s articles “The Significance of the St. 
 Petersburg Elections” and “A Comparison of the Stolypin and the Narodnik Agrarian Programmes” were published. 
 Reduced Russia, and at a certain stage of its development even the monstrously high dam of the June Third electoral law will be unable to stem the “democratic flood”. 
 The majority of the voters in the second curia undoubted-ly come from the democratic sections of the population. 
 TheCadets induce them to follow their lead by simply deceiving them, by making themselves, a liberal-monarchist bour-geois party, out to be democrats. 
 This kind of deceit has been, and is, practised by all liberals in the world in elec-tions to every sort of parliament. 
 And the workers’ partiesin all countries gauge their success by, among other things,the extent to which they succeed in freeing petty-bourgeoisdemocrats from liberal influence. 
 The Russian Marxists, too, must set themselves this task clearly, specifically, and firmly. 
 That is why, with regard to the big cities, they have said plainly in their well-knownJanuary decisions that blocs there are permissible, in viewof the known absence of a Black-Hundred danger, only with the democrats, against the liberals. 
 * This decision “takes the bull by the horns”. 
 It gives a straightforward answer to one of the most important questions of election tactics. 
 It determines the spirit , the trend, and the character of the entire election campaign. 
 On the other hand, those liquidators who like to talk of the Cadets as of “representatives” of the “urban democracy”are committing a grave error. 
 This kind of talk distorts matters by representing the liberals ’ election victories over the democrats, and the liberals’ election tricks played on democratic voters, as proof of the Cadets’ “democracy”. 
As though Europe did not know of dozens of instances ofanti -democratic parties for years keeping various democratic strata in leading strings, until real bourgeois democrats, but most often Social-Democrats, freed those strata from the influence of political parties that were alien to them in spirit. 
 The election struggle in St. 
 Petersburg is a struggle for hegemony between the liberals and the worker democratswithin the whole of Russia’s emancipation movement. 
 This exceptionally important role of the St. 
 Petersburg elections leads us, incidentally, to two practical conclusions.

 He to whom much is given, much shall be asked. 
 The St. 
 Petersburg workers will have to carry on the election cam-paign in the urban second curia on behalf of all the worker democrats of all Russia. 
 It is a great and difficult task thatthey have to tackle. 
 They must serve as a model. 
 They mustshow the greatest initiative, energy and perseverance. 
 Theyhave done so in regard to the workers’ daily newspaper. 
 Atthe elections, too, they must continue the work they have begun so splendidly. 
 The attention of all Russia is riveted on the election struggle in St. 
 Petersburg. 
 All Russia should also help St. 
 Petersburg. 
 Unless the St. 
 Petersburg workers receive themost varied aid from all parts of Russia, they will be unableto overcome the “enemy” by themselves.

 A COMPARISON OF THE STOLYPIN AND THE NARODNIK AGRARIAN PROGRAMMES In previous articles (see Nevskaya Zvezda Nos. 
 3 and 6) * we have cited the basic data on landownership in European Russia and described the nature of the agrarian question in Russia. 
 The main point of this question is to abolish medie-valism in landownership . 
 The contradiction between capitalism, which prevails throughout the world, including Russia, and medievallandownership , as embodied both in the landed estates and in the peasant allotments, is irreconcilable. 
 The old medie-val system of landownership is bound to be broken up, andthe more drastic, ruthless and bold this break-up, the betterfor the entire development of Russia and the better for theworkers, and for the peasants, who are today crushed andoppressed by innumerable survivals of medievalism, as well as by capitalism. 
 The question may be asked: Such being the situation, how can one compare the Stolypin and the Narodnik agrarianprogrammes? Are they not in direct opposition to eachother? Yes, they are, but this opposition does not remove the one fundamental point which the two programmes have in common , namely, the fact that both recognise the necessity of breaking up the old system of landownership. 
 The old has to be broken up—as early and thoroughly as possible,say those in charge of Stolypin’s “land distribution”; but ithas to be broken up in such a way as to ensure that the whole burden of it falls on the shoulders of the majority of the *See pp. 
 32-35 and 73-77 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 peasants—of the most ruined and most disinherited of them. 
 The landlords should lose nothing in the process. 
 If it is inevitable that they should lose part of their land, then the land should be alienated exclusively by the freely givenconsent of the landlords, and at a price considered “fair”by the landlords. 
 The well-to-do peasants should be support-ed, and there is no reason to shrink from the ruin of themass of “weak” peasants. 
 Such is the meaning of the Stolypin agrarian programme. 
 The Council of the United Nobility, which entrusted Sto-lypin with drafting it, behaved as a true representative ofthe reactionaries—not of those who make fine speeches butof those who mean business. 
 The Council was perfectly loyalto its class interests when it banked on the strong. 
 And in-deed, after 1905 it became obvious that the police and the bureaucracy alone were inadequate as a protection againstthe peasants. 
 Where else was the Council of the United Nobility to seek for allies? Only among the insignificant minority of the well-to-do peasants—the kulaks. 
 It could not have found any other allies in the countryside. 
 And to win over the “new landlords” to their side, the reactionaries did not shrinkfrom delivering the whole countryside into their hands liter-ally to be sacked and plundered. 
 If a break-up is inevitable, then let us break up allotment landownership in our favour and for the benefit of the new landlords —that is the gist of the agrarian policy which the Council of the United Nobility dictated to Stoly-pin. 
 But, speaking in purely theoretical terms, it has to be admitted that a break-up—a no less, and indeed much more,drastic one—is also possible from the other side . 
 It cuts both ways. 
 If, for instance, the 70 million dessiatines of land belonging to 30,000 landlords were to pass to 10 millionpeasant households in addition to the 75 million dessiatinesthey already own, and if the two categories of land weremerged and then distributed among the well-to-do and mid-dle peasants (the poor peasants could not use the land any-way, because they have nothing to plough, sow, fertilise and cultivate it with), what would be the result of thereform? Pose this question from a purely economic standpoint. 
 Consider this fundamental possibility from the angle of the general conditions of capitalist economy throughout the world. 
 You will see that our suggested reform wouldresult in a more consistent , drastic and ruthless break-up of medieval landownership than the Stolypin programme envisages. 
 Why medieval and none but medieval? Because capitalist landownership cannot be abolished, by its very nature, through any transfer of the land, not even through the trans-fer of all the land to the state (i. 
e. 
, through what the scienceof political economy calls land “nationalisation”). 
 Capital-ist landownership is the holding of land by those who havecapital and adapt themselves best to the market. 
 Regardless of whether the land is still owned by the landlord, or by the state or the allotment peasant, it is bound to have a master , who can always rent it. 
 The renting of land is increasing inall capitalist countries, under the most diverse forms of landownership. 
 No bans whatever can prevent the capital-ist, the master who has capital and knows the market, from laying his hands on the land, since the market dominates the whole of social production, i. 
e. 
, since this productionremains capitalist. 
 Nor is that all. 
 The renting of land is even more convenient for pure capitalism, for the fullest, freest, and most “ideal”adaptation to the market, than is ownership of land. 
 Why? Because private ownership of land hampers its transfer from hand to hand, hinders the adaptation of land tenure to the conditions of the market, perpetuates ownership of the land by a particular family or person and his heirs, evenif they are bad farmers. 
 Renting is a more flexible form,under which the adaptation of land tenure to the market takes place most simply, most easily and most rap-idly. 
 That, incidentally, is why Britain is not an exception among the capitalist countries, but is the country that, fromthe point of view of capitalism, has the most perfect agrar-ian system, as Marx pointed out in his criticism of Rod-bertus. 
 90 And what is Britain’s agrarian system? It is the old system of landownership, landlordism, with the new,free, purely capitalist renting of land. 
 And what if that landlordism were to exist without land-lords, i. 
e. 
, if the land were owned, not by landlords, but by the state? That, from the point of view of capitalism, would be a still more perfect agrarian system, with still greater freedom of adaptation of land tenure to the market,with still greater ease in the mobilisation of the land as anobject of economy, with still greater freedom, breadth,clarity and definiteness in the class struggle characteristic of every form of capitalist landownership. 
 And the more a country is lagging behind world capi-talism, the greater the effort it must make to overtake itsneighbours, the more it has “neglected” its “disease”, thedisease of medieval landownership and small-scale bondagefarming, and the more imperative that country’s need for a radical break-up of all its relations of landownership, of all its agrarian system, the more natural will be the rise andwide dissemination in that country, among its agriculturalpopulation, of all sorts of ideas and plans of land national-isation. 
 Both the year 1905 and the two first Dumas proved beyond question—and the Third Duma confirmed it indirectly, through its “peasant” deputies (sifted through a landlordsieve)—that all sorts of ideas and plans for nationalisingthe land are extremely widespread among Russia’s agricul-tural population. 
 Before approving or condemning theseideas, one should ask oneself why they have become wide-spread and what economic necessity has evoked them. 
 It is not enough to criticise those ideas from the stand-point of their inner logic and harmony or of their theoreticalcorrectness. 
 They should be criticised from the standpointof the economic necessity reflected in them, however “fan-ciful”, inaccurate or “twisted” this reflection may some-times be. 
 The economic necessity which at the beginning of the twentieth century gave rise among the Russian peasantryto ideas of nationalising the land is the necessity of a drasticbreak-up of the old system of landownership. 
 The ideasof “equalised division” of all the land are ideas of equality , necessarily born of the struggle against the survivals of serfdom and inevitably transplanted to the land in a sit-uation where 30,000 “residual serf-owners” possess 70 million dessiatines, while 10 million bond peasants possess 75 million dessiatines. 
 There is nothing utopian about the transfer of the first category of land into the second category, or rather to theowners of this second category. 
 What is utopian is merely the dream of equality among the masters of the land whilethe market dominates; it is utopian to dream of the “ right to land” for all “citizens, men and women” (including those who have no household) under capitalism. 
 But the utopian character of these ideas should not allow us to forget the very true, living reality which is actually behind them. 
 There is nothing utopian about the abolition of all medie-val distinctions of landownership—landlord, allotment, etc. 
 There is nothing utopian about breaking up the old rela-tions in regard to the land. 
 On the contrary, the develop-ment of capitalism most imperatively demands this break-up. 
 There can be neither “equalised division” of the land nor “socialisation” of it under capitalism. 
 That is uto-pia. 
 Land nationalisation is quite feasible economically under capitalism, and its real significance would consist in any case—that is, no matter how it was effected, by whom andon what conditions, whether stably and for a long time orunstably and for a short time—in the maximum eliminationof all that is medieval in Russian landownership and Rus-sia’s agrarian system; it would consist in the freest adapta-tion of the new system of land tenure and landownership to the new conditions of the world market. 
 Let us imagine for a moment that the Left Narodniks’ plan was put into practice, say, through the equal divisionof all the lands among all citizens, men and women. 
 Such division under capitalism is the greatest absurdity. 
 Under capitalism, it would not and could not last even a year. 
But does this imply that its results would be zero or neg-ative? Not in the least! Its results would be of tremendous ad-vantage —not the kind the Left Narodniks expect, but a most real advantage. 
 That advantage would consist in all distinctions between the present social-estate and categoryforms of landownership being broken up. 
 It would be a tre-mendous gain for the whole national economy, for capital-ism, for the proletariat, because nothing could be more harmful to the development of Russia than our old, present-day, landownership. 
 Both landlordism and allotment land-ownership are thoroughly feudal forms of landowner-ship. 
 An equalised redivision of the land could not last, but it would be impossible to go back to the old system ! No “res-toration” could revive the boundaries once they had been removed. 
 No political force on earth could prevent the es-tablishment of such new boundaries, limits, and forms of land tenure as would correspond to the new requirements of the market. 
 “Departition the land,” I recall a Left Narodnik saying in the Second Duma. 
 He fancied that the result would be “equalised land tenure”. 
 He was mistaken. 
 But speakingthrough him was, as the irony of history would have it, the most consistent and fearless radical bourgeois , who is aware of the absurdity of the old, medieval “partitions” of our “allotment”, “nobility”, “church”, etc. 
, etc. 
, landowner-ship, and is aware of the necessity of breaking down all those partitions to make way for a new distribution of the land. 
 Only, this distribution would have to be not “per capita”,which is the Narodnik’s dream, but per capital , as imposed by the market . 
 The Narodniks’ constructive plans are utopia. 
 But their constructive plans have an element that is destructive in relation to medievalism. 
 And that element is by no meansutopia. 
 It is the most living reality. 
 It is the most consist-ent and progressive reality from the standpoint of capital-ism and the proletariat. 
 Let us briefly sum up our views. 
 The real similarity be-tween the Stolypin and the Narodnik agrarian programmes lies in the fact that both advocate a radical break-up of the old, medieval system of landownership. 
 And that is verygood. 
 That system deserves no better than to be broken up. 
The most reactionary of all are those Cadets of Rech and Russkiye Vedomosti who reproach Stolypin for causing a break-up, instead of proving the need for a still more con-sistent and resolute break-up. 
 We shall see in a followingarticle that the Stolypin type of break-up cannot do away with bondage and labour service, while the Narodnik type can. 
* For the time being we shall note that the only entirely real result of the Stolypin break-up is a famine among 30million people. 
 And it remains to be seen whether the Sto-lypin break-up may not teach the Russian people how they should carry out a more thorough break-up. 
 It is no doubt teaching that. 
 But will it succeed in it? Time will tell.

 has passed through unprecedentedly hard years of rampant counter-revolution and is now on the rightway to re-establishing its organisation and increasing its forces and its guiding influence on the Russian proletariat, which dealt powerful blows at the autocracy in 1905 andwill destroy it in the coming revolution. 
 The hard years 1908-11 were years of division; it was in that period that the present Executive Committee of theSocial-Democratic Party of Poland and Lithuania, which had joined our Party in 1906 and had marched with us Bolsheviks against the Menshevik opportunists, seceded fromthe R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 The worker Social-Democrats of Poland should make a critical appraisal of this secession of the present Executivefrom the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 Therefore I very gladly accept the proposal of the Warsaw Committee of the S. 
D. 
P. 
 of Poland and Lithuania that I should briefly explain in Gazeta Ro-botnicza 91 the causes of the division in the Party and the sorry role which the present Executive played in it, andshould point out the immediate tasks of the Social-Demo-cratic proletariat of all Russia. 
 I Our comrades, the Polish workers, are familiar with the differences existing between the Bolsheviks and Mensheviksduring the revolution of 1905. 
 A number of prominent rep-resentatives of the S. 
D. 
P. 
 of Poland and Lithuania, such as Rosa Luxemburg, were on the Mensheviks’ side at first, in 1904, but the revolution soon revealed their error, clearlydemonstrating the Mensheviks’ opportunism. 
 The counter-revolution of 1908-11 initiated a new stage in Russian history. 
 The old autocracy moved a step closer to a bourgeois monarchy. 
 The Duma of the landlords and the big bourgeoisie came into being. 
 Tsarism had not yet lostits feudal character, but it was pursuing a bourgeois agrarianpolicy designed to institute private landownership as earlyas possible, at the price of unprecedented ruin and extermi-nation of millions of peasants. 
 Bourgeois liberalism made a sharp turn towards counter-revolution, and indulged in veritable orgies of renegacy. 
 Unparalleled division and dissension prevailed among the intelligentsia in general. 
 The proletariat was subjected topersecution on the part of tsarism, which was taking itsvengeance for the revolution, and to torrents of slander on the part of the renegades. 
 The task of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 was to preserve the revolution-ary Social-Democratic Party of the working class by adapt-ing itself to the new conditions of work. 
 The very first steps towards accomplishing that task brought out new anti-proletarian trends in the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 that tended to undermine the very existence of the Party. 
 They were engendered by the historical situation which ourcounter-revolution had created. 
 These bourgeois trends areliquidationism and otzovism . 
 The liquidators, caught up by the wave of bourgeois de-sertion, repudiated the revolution. 
 Giving up the illegal Party as a bad job, they sought only a legal basis for them-selves in the allegedly “constitutional” regime of June 3(16) and advocated its constitutional renovation. 
 An “openworkers’ party” and slogans of constitutional reform were the gist of their policy. 
 It was not a Social-Democratic, buta liberal labour policy. 
 Obviously, it would be simply ridiculous to compare the liquidators with the West-European opportunists withinthe Social-Democratic workers’ parties (as the present Exec-utive does under Tyszka’s influence). 
 Our liquidators re-fuse to recognise the Party in its illegal, i. 
e. 
, its present,form, and are founding a new , legal party. 
 It is not a trend inside the Party, but a withdrawal from the Party. 
 The liquidators’ obvious repudiation and destruction of the Partygave rise to sharp resistance from the Mensheviks themselves. 
 The worker Mensheviks in Russia refused to follow the liq-uidators, and outside Russia the Menshevik Plekhanov put himself at the head of the “pro-Party” Mensheviks (anti-liquidators). 
 Plekhanov has now publicly and unequivocallyadmitted in the press that the liquidators are founding a new party. 
 We shall add, for the Polish workers’ information, that the liquidators’ main press organs are: abroad, Golos Sotsial-Demokrata92 (Martov, Dan, Axelrod and other Golos supporters); in Russia, Nasha Zarya (Potresov, Levitsky, Cherevanin and others). 
 The “otzovists” (from the wordotozvat , * meaning the Social-Democratic deputies to the Third Duma) boycotted the Third Duma, for they did notrealise the necessity of using the Duma rostrum and all “legal opportunities” for revolutionary Social-Democratic work. 
 They reduced the slogans of the revolutionary tacticsof 1905 to meaningless phrases. 
 Experience soon showedthat boycotting the Third Duma was an absurdity leadingthe Russian Social-Democrat boycotters to anarchism evenagainst their will. 
 In the summer of 1907 most Bolsheviks favoured a boycott; but as early as the spring of 1908 they had learned the lesson taught by experience and very sharplyrebutted otzovist propaganda in St. 
 Petersburg and Moscow. 
After being defeated so thoroughly in Russia, the otzo-vists and their defenders eked out a miserable existenceabroad in the form of the absolutely impotent little group of Vperyod (Lunacharsky, Alexinsky and others). 
 Needless to add that, owing to the weakness of the ma-jority of organisations in Russia and to the fact that thegroups abroad were out of touch with the work going on inRussia, most of those groups were quite “freely” engaged indestroying and disrupting the Party, completely ignoring all discipline and holding no mandate from any organisation in Russia to direct a newspaper or publish pamphlets andleaflets. 
 Besides the little groups holding different viewson questions of principle, there sprang up, as usually hap-pens, various little groups that had no principles at all,and strove to make some little political capital by broker-age, petty diplomacy, and intrigues under the guise of *To recall.

 “reconciling” and “uniting” the Party. 
 Past masters in this respect were Trotsky with the Vienna newspaper Pravda and Tyszka with the Executive Committee. 
 II The R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 was confronted with the question of how to re-establish the Party. 
 Clearly, it was impossible to re-establish the Party jointly with those who wanted to liquidate the Party or with those who boycotted the Duma and legal opportunities. 
 Eitherthe little groups abroad which were pursuing that bourgeoispolicy must abandon it in submission to the overwhelmingmajority of the organisations, groups and circles in Russia, or Russia must re-establish the Party in spite of those groups abroad. 
 In January 1910 the Central Committee of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 held a plenary meeting for the last time; it made an attemptto save the liquidators and otzovists, who were breakingaway from the Social-Democrats, and to guide them on to the path of Party work. 
 The absurdity and un-Social-Demo-cratic character of both deviations were so obvious that no one ventured to defend them. 
 It was unanimously recognised that both were bourgeois trends, and that only by repudiat-ing them could conditions be provided for the revival ofthe Party. 
 But unanimous decision is insufficient if it is not followed by united action. 
 The liquidators and otzovists, contraryto the decisions of the Plenary Meeting of the Central Com-mittee, did not relax but intensified their destructive work. 
 It turned out that it was the Party’s Central Organ, led bythe Bolsheviks and the Poles, that fought for the Party during a year and a half (January 1910 to June 1911), with the Menshevik Plekhanov contributing vigorously to thestruggle against the liquidators. 
 “Working” against the Party with might and main were the liquidators, the Vperyod group, Trotsky and the Bund. 
 The Letts vacillated, most often siding with the liquidators. 
 The liquidators carried their destructive work to the point of destroying the Central Committee of the Party!The Plenary Meeting resolved to re-establish the C. 
C. 
 in Russia and to co-opt new members; but the liquidators would not even attend a single sitting, and declared that both the illegal Party and the illegal C. 
C. 
 were “harmful”. 
 Under these circumstances, can anyone compare the liqui-dators with the West-European opportunists unless he isbent on intrigue? The Party was left without a C. 
C. 
, and its disintegration was unavoidable. 
 Only the Russian organisations, i. 
e. 
, those operating in Russia, could re-establish it. 
 And that is when Tyszka displayed his hypocritical policy of in-trigue in all its splendour by winning in the ExecutiveCommittee a majority over the adherents of a more princi-pled policy and pushing the Executive to a break with theR.

, to the point where it found itself between the Party and the liquidators of the Party. 
 To explain that policy, which harms the Polish Social-Democratic movement, we shall first of all cite a fact ofthe ideological struggle in our Party. 
 The Plenary Meeting of the Central Committee unani-mously condemned liquidationism, as we have pointed out above. 
 But one section of the most important resolution (known as its Clause 1) was formulated in such a way as tohave the directly opposite meaning; it played into the handsof the liquidators. 
 This clause expressed the opinion that atpresent, i. 
e. 
, at a time of counter-revolution, the Social-Democrats were for the first time making full use of the methods of the international Social-Democracy. 
 This clause, which left a loophole for renegade theories, was proposedby Tyszka, who tried to manoeuvre between the liquidatorsand the Party. 
 It is only natural that the liquidators shouldhave enthusiastically supported the clause, helping Tyszkato “victory”; some of the Bolsheviks—the so-called group of “conciliators” (i. 
e. 
, virtual Trotskyists)—also went over to the side of the liquidators. 
 After the Plenary Meeting Plekhanov superbly and scath-ingly ridiculed the clause (not knowing who its author was)for its “looseness”, vagueness, and generality. 
 I spoke afterPlekhanov and told about my fruitless struggle against Tyszka’s alliance with the “conciliators” and liquidators. 
 * *See present edition, Vol. 
 16, pp. 
 226-31. 
— Ed. 
 In two years, not one of the numerous writers of the Execu-tive has spoken a single word in defence of that clause. 
 All that Tyszka’s manoeuvring has resulted in is a liqui-dationist distortion of the views of the Party. 
 The results of this policy have been even more unfortu-nate in regard to the organisational question. 
 The Central Committee does not exist. 
 The Party can be re-established only by a conference of the organisations in Russia. 
 But how to convene such a conference? Obviously, it must be convened not together with those who are liqui-dating the Party, but without them . 
 Tyszka is walking the tight-rope, manoeuvring and play-ing at “unification” of the Party with those who are liquidat-ing it. 
 First Tyszka plus a small group of “conciliators” (a perfectly impotent little group abroad, which did not during a whole year receive a single order for its printedwritings from any organisation in Russia) joined the Bol-sheviks, assumed control over the convening of a conference, gave money to the agents who were to convene it, and dis-patched those agents, asserting as they did so that they were “unifying” the Party (an assertion which brought Homeric laughter both from the liquidators and from us). 
 The agents began their tour with Kiev , with a Menshevik organisation whose status was so indisputable that evenour sworn enemies, Trotsky and the Letts, admitted this inthe press. 
 In view of the furious attacks of the liquidators on our Conference, the Polish workers must know that it was with the participation of the above-mentioned organi-sation that the Russian Organising Commission for theconvening of the Conference was formed (in October 1911). 
And it was a delegate from that organisation (Kiev) thatwas chairman of the Credentials Committee at the Con-ference! It should be clear that the majority on the Russian Organ-ising Commission consists of Bolsheviks and part of the“pro-Party” (i. 
e. 
, anti-liquidationist) Mensheviks. 
 The otherlittle groups were not represented on it, being no more thanfictitious units abroad having no connections in Russia. 
 That is when Tyszka, in despair because there was no possibility of mediating and intriguing, playing at unifica-tion with the liquidators, dissociated himself from the Russian Organising Commission and did not attend the Con-ference even though he had been invited three times . 
 Instead, he attended a meeting of the liquidators93 t o discuss the convening of another (liquidationist) conference,and then left it, saying that there were liquidators there!!Is not a “conciliator” like that a buffoon? * III The January Conference of the R.

 united most of the organisations in Russia: St. 
 Petersburg, Moscow,the Volga, the Caucasus, the South, the Western Territory. 
The Conference established that the liquidators ( Nasha Zarya ) had placed themselves outside the Party. 
 It dis-claimed all responsibility for the little groups abroad which were disrupting the Party by their actions. 
 At its twenty-three sittings, the Conference examined all the tactical questions in detail and adopted a wholeseries of resolutions in the spirit of the previous four years’work of the Central Organ and all the leading Party bodies. 
 The Conference defined its terms of reference as the supreme Party body and elected the Central Committee. 
 It is quite understandable why the liquidators, and all the impotent little groups abroad along with them, attackthe Conference, foaming at the mouth. 
 The Conference con-demned them. 
 Every condemned person is entitled to abuse his judges all day long. 
 But there is no other Central Committee, no other Social-Democratic Party in Russia. 
 Tyszka and the Executivewho kept away from this Conference and assure the Polishworkers that it is possible (with the help of brokers) to“unify” the Party with the liquidators, are deceiving the workers. 
 As a result of this deceit, the Polish workers were unable to confer with their Russian comrades, to discusswith them tactics and slogans at such an important time *The Executive Committee, writing in Vorwärts , calls Trotsky an agent of the liquidators, and in Czerwony Sztandar 94 it argues that there can be no unity, not only with the liquidationist Left wing ofthe Polish Socialist Party, but with the liquidationist Bund in Poland!!

 To assist this strengthening,consolidate the illegal organisation, give the movement thecorrect revolutionary slogans, rebut the opportunism of thelegalist liquidators, imbue the legal organisations with ananti-liquidationist spirit, and carry out the elections to the Fourth Duma along these lines—these are the immediate tasks which the R.

 Lenin A REPLY TO THE LIQUIDATOR S95 The liquidators of Nevsky Golos are doing their utmost to disrupt the unity of the workers’ elections in St. 
 Pe-tersburg. 
 They will fail. 
 Hypocritical shouts about “unity” ( coming from liquidators!! ) cannot deceive anyone. 
 The unity of the working-class democracy is certain. 
 The workers do not follow the lead of those who liquidate the workers’ democratic Party and merely promise to replaceit by an open “party “ pursuing a liberal labour policy. 
 Unity of the mass of the workers and not “agreement”, to the detri-ment of this unity, with the circles of liquidationist split-ters from among the intelligentsia—this is what the polit-ically-conscious workers want. 
 And Pravda 96 is following this slogan. 
 We are not put out by the unworthy sallies of the liqui-dators, who are openly asking where to “find” that which does not make a boast of being “open”. 
 Draw up your “open”platform, gentlemen, found your new, “open” party—anda good riddance to you! P.

 I earnestly ask you to answer me immediately, or as soon as possible, on the matter I have raised here. 
 Keep-ing silent will not do . 
 You can spoil everything and evoke protests from the workers on the left by keeping silent about this. 
 The liquidators must be rebuffed. 
 We cannot conduct an election campaign without saying for whom we are doing it (people might think it is for the benefit of the liquidators). 
 If you do not want to aggravate and spoil everything “on the left”, publish this “reply to the liquidators”. 
 If you do not publish it, send this sheet back to me without delay . 
 It is important to me! Written in July 1912 First published in 1933 , Published according in Lenin Miscellany XXV to the manuscript IN SWITZERLAND The local socialists call Switzerland a “republic of lack-eys”. 
 This petty-bourgeois country, in which inn-keeping haslong been a major industry, has depended too much on wealthy parasites squandering millions on summer travel in the mountains. 
 A small proprietor toadying to rich tour-ists—such, until recently, was the most widespread type ofSwiss bourgeois. 
 Things are changing now. 
 A large-scale industry is devel-oping in Switzerland. 
 The use of waterfalls and mountain rivers as direct sources of electric power is laying a big part in this. 
 The power of falling water, which replacescoal in industry, is often called “white coal”. 
 The industrialisation of Switzerland, i. 
e. 
, the develop-ment there of a large-scale industry, has put an end to theformer stagnation in the working-class movement. 
 The struggle between capital and labour is assuming a more acute character. 
 The drowsy, philistine spirit which oftenin the past pervaded some of the Swiss workers’ associationsis disappearing to give way to the fighting mood of a class-conscious and organised proletariat that is aware of itsstrength. 
 The Swiss workers entertain no illusions about the fact that theirs is a bourgeois republic upholding the same kindof wage slavery as exists in all the capitalist countries with-out exception. 
 At the same time, however, they have learnedvery well to use the freedom of their republican insti-tutions to enlighten and organise the wide mass of the workers. 
 The fruits of their work were clearly revealed during the general strike in Zurich on July 12 (June 29, old style). 
 This is how it came about. 
 The painters and fitters in Zurich had been on strike for several weeks, demanding higher wages and shorter hours. 
 The enraged employers de-cided to break the resistance of the strikers. 
 The governmentof the bourgeois republic, eager to serve the capitalists,came to their aid, and began to deport foreign strikers! (There are many foreign workers, particularly Italians, whogo to Switzerland to work. 
) But the use of brute force did not help. 
 The workers held their ground as one man. 
 Then the capitalists resorted to the following method. 
 In Hamburg, Germany, there is a firm, owned by LudwigKoch, which specialises in supplying strike-breakers. 
 TheZurich capitalists—patriots and republicans, don’t laugh!—had that firm send in strike-breakers, who they knew inclu-ded all sorts of criminals convicted in Germany for pan-dering, brawling, etc. 
 The capitalists supplied this riff-raff organg of convicts (lumpenproletarians) with pistols. 
 The bra-zen band of strike-breakers filled the taverns in the workers’district and there engaged in unheard-of hooliganism. 
 Whena group of workers gathered together to eject the hooligans, one of the latter shot down a worker who was on strike. 
 The workers’ patience was exhausted. 
 They beat up the murderer. 
 It was decided to make an interpellation in theZurich City Council on the hooligans’ outrages. 
 And whenthe city authorities, in defence of the capitalists, prohibitedstrike picketing, the workers resolved to protest by a one-day general strike . 
 All the trade unions declared unanimously for the strike. 
 The printers were the only sad exception. 
 They declaredagainst the strike, and the meeting of 425 representativesof all the Zurich workers’ organisations replied to the print-ers’ decision with a stentorian cry of “Shame!” The strike was decided on, even though the leaders of political organ-isations were against it (the same old spirit of the philistine,opportunist Swiss leaders!). 
 Knowing that the capitalists and the management would try to wreck the peaceful strike, the workers acted accordingto the wise maxim, “In war as in war. 
” In war-time one does not tell the enemy when an attack will take place. 
 The work-ers purposely declared on Thursday that the strike wouldtake place on Tuesday or Wednesday, whereas in reality they had fixed it for Friday . 
 The capitalists and the man-agement were taken by surprise. 
 The strike was a signal success. 
 Thirty thousand leaflets in German and Italian were circulated early in the morn-ing. 
 Some 2,000 strikers occupied the tram depots. 
 Every-thing stopped. 
 Life in the city came to a standstill. 
 Fridayis a market day in Zurich, but the city seemed dead. 
 Theconsumption of spirits (all alcoholic drinks) was prohibited by the strike committee, and the workers strictly obeyed this decision. 
 An imposing mass demonstration took place at 2 p. 
m. 
 When the speeches were over, the workers dispersed peace-fully, and without singing. 
 The government and the capitalists, who had hoped to provoke the workers to violence, saw their failure and are now beside themselves with rage. 
 Not only strike picketing,but also open-air meetings and demonstrations have beenprohibited by special decree throughout the Zurich Canton. 
The police occupied the People’s House in Zurich and arrest-ed a number of the workers’ leaders. 
 The capitalists an-nounced a three-day lock-out by way of avenging themselves for the strike. 
 The workers are keeping calm; they scrupulously observe the boycott of spirits and wine, saying among themselves:“Why shouldn’t a working man rest three days a year, sincethe rich rest all the year round?” Pravda No.

 to the Pravda text DEMOCRACY AND NARODISM IN CHINA The article by Sun Yat-sen, provisional President of the Chinese Republic, which we take from the Brussels social-ist newspaper, Le Peuple , is of exceptional interest to us Russians. 
 It is said that the onlooker sees most of the game. 
 And Sun Yat-sen is a most interesting “onlooker”, for he appearsto be wholly uninformed about Russia despite his Europeaneducation. 
 And now, quite independently of Russia, of Russian experience and Russian literature, this enlightened spokesman of militant and victorious Chinese democracy,which has won a republic, poses purely Russian questions. 
A progressive Chinese democrat, he argues exactly like aRussian. 
 His similarity to a Russian Narodnik is so greatthat it goes as far as a complete identity of fundamental ideas and of many individual expressions. 
 The onlooker sees most of the game. 
 The platform of the great Chinese democracy—for that is what Sun Yat-sen’sarticle represents—impels us, and provides us with a con-venient occasion, to examine anew, in the light of recentworld events, the relation between democracy and Naro-dism in modern bourgeois revolutions in Asia. 
 This is one of the most serious questions confronting Russia in the rev-olutionary epoch which began in 1905. 
 And it confrontsnot only Russia, but the whole of Asia, as will be seen fromthe platform of the provisional President of the Chinese Re-public, particularly when this platform is compared with the revolutionary developments in Russia, Turkey, Persia and China. 
 In very many and very essential respects, Russiais undoubtedly an Asian country and, what is more, one of the most benighted, medieval and shamefully backward of Asian countries. 
 Beginning with its distant and lone forerunner, the no-bleman Herzen, and continuing right up to its mass repre-sentatives, the members of the Peasant Union of 1905 andthe Trudovik deputies to the first three Dumas of 1906-12,Russian bourgeois democracy has had a Narodnik colour-ing. 
 Bourgeois democracy in China, as we now see, has the same Narodnik colouring. 
 Let us now consider, with Sun Yat-sen as an example, the “social significance” of the ideasgenerated by the deep-going revolutionary movement ofthe hundreds of millions who are finally being drawn intothe stream of world capitalist civilisation. 
 Every line of Sun Yat-sen’s platform breathes a spirit of militant and sincere democracy. 
 It reveals a thorough un-derstanding of the inadequacy of a “racial” revolution. 
 Thereis not a trace in it of indifference to political issues, or evenof underestimation of political liberty, or of the idea thatChinese “social reform”, Chinese constitutional reforms,etc. 
, could be compatible with Chinese autocracy. 
 It stands for complete democracy and the demand for a republic. 
 It squarely poses the question of the condition of the masses,of the mass struggle. 
 It expresses warm sympathy for thetoiling and exploited people, faith in their strength and inthe justice of their cause. 
 Before us is the truly great ideology of a truly great people capable not only of lamenting its age-long slavery and dream-ing of liberty and equality, but of fighting the age-long oppressors of China. 
 One is naturally inclined to compare the provisional President of the Republic in benighted, inert, Asiatic Chinawith the presidents of various republics in Europe and Amer-ica, in countries of advanced culture. 
 The presidents in those republics are all businessmen, agents or puppets of a bourgeoisie rotten to the core and besmirched from head tofoot with mud and blood—not the blood of padishahs andemperors, but the blood of striking workers shot down inthe name of progress and civilisation. 
 In those countries the presidents represent the bourgeoisie, which long ago renounced all the ideals of its youth, has thoroughly pros-tituted itself, sold itself body and soul to the millionaires and multimillionaires, to the feudal lords turned bourgeois, etc. 
 In China, the Asiatic provisional President of the Re-public is a revolutionary democrat, endowed with the no-bility and heroism of a class that is rising, not declining, aclass that does not dread the future, but believes in it andfights for it selflessly, a class that does not cling to main-tenance and restoration of the past in order to safeguard its privileges, but hates the past and knows how to cast off its dead and stifling decay. 
 Does that mean, then, that the materialist West has hope-lessly decayed and that light shines only from the mystic,religious East? No, quite the opposite. 
 It means that theEast has definitely taken the Western path, that new hun-dreds of millions of people will from now on share in the struggle for the ideals which the West has already workedout for itself. 
 What has decayed is the Western bourgeoisie,which is already confronted by its grave-digger, the prole-tariat. 
 But in Asia there is still a bourgeoisie capable of championing sincere, militant, consistent democracy, a wor-thy comrade of France’s great men of Enlightenment and great leaders of the close of the eighteenth century. 
 The chief representative, or the chief social bulwark, of this Asian bourgeoisie that is still capable of supporting ahistorically progressive cause, is the peasant. 
 And side byside with him there already exists a liberal bourgeoisie whose leaders, men like Yüan Shih-kai, are above all capable of treachery: yesterday they feared the emperor, and cringedbefore him; then they betrayed him when they saw thestrength, and sensed the victory, of the revolutionarydemocracy; and tomorrow they will betray the democrats tomake a deal with some old or new “constitutional” emperor. 
 The real emancipation of the Chinese people from age-long slavery would be impossible without the great, sin-cerely democratic enthusiasm which is rousing the workingmasses and making them capable of miracles, and which isevident from every sentence of Sun Yat-sen’s platform. 
 But the Chinese Narodnik combines this ideology of mili-tant democracy, firstly, with socialist dreams, with hopes of China avoiding the capitalist path, of preventing capitalism,and, secondly, with a plan for, and advocacy of, radical agrarian reform. 
 It is these two last ideological and political trends that constitute the element which forms Narodism — Narodism in the specific sense of that term, i. 
e. 
, as dis-tinct from democracy, as a supplement to democracy. 
 What is the origin and significance of these trends?Had it not been for the immense spiritual and revolution-ary upsurge of the masses, the Chinese democracy would havebeen unable to overthrow the old order and establish the republic. 
 Such an upsurge presupposes and evokes the most sincere sympathy for the condition of the working masses,and the bitterest hatred for their oppressors and exploiters. 
And in Europe and America—from which the progressiveChinese, all the Chinese who have experienced this upsurge, have borrowed their ideas of liberation—emancipation from the bourgeoisie, i. 
e. 
, socialism, is the immediate task. 
 This is bound to arouse sympathy for socialism among Chi-nese democrats, and is the source of their subjective socialism. 
 They are subjectively socialists because they are opposed to oppression and exploitation of the masses. 
 But the objec-tive conditions of China, a backward, agricultural, semi-feudal country numbering nearly 500 million people, place on the order of the day only one specific, historically dis-tinctive form of this oppression and exploitation, namely,feudalism. 
 Feudalism was based on the predominance ofagriculture and natural economy. 
 The source of the feudalexploitation of the Chinese peasant was his attachment to the land in some form. 
 The political exponents of this exploitation were the feudal lords, all together and individu-ally, with the emperor as the head of the whole system. 
 But it appears that out of the subjectively socialist ideas and programmes of the Chinese democrat there emerges infact a programme for “changing all the juridical founda-tions” of “immovable property” alone , a programme for the abolition of feudal exploitation alone . 
 That is the essence of Sun Yat-sen’s Narodism, of his pro-gressive, militant, revolutionary programme for bourgeois-democratic agrarian reform, and of his quasi-socialist theory. 
 From the point of view of doctrine, this theory is that of a petty-bourgeois “socialist” reactionary. 
 For the idea that capitalism can be “prevented” in China and that a “socialrevolution” there will be made easier by the country’s back-wardness, and so on, is altogether reactionary. 
 And Sun Yat-sen himself, with inimitable, one might say virginal, naïveté, smashes his reactionary Narodnik theory by admit-ting what reality forces him to admit, namely, that “Chinais on the eve of a gigantic industrial [i. 
e. 
, capitalist] de-velopment”, that in China “trade [i. 
e. 
, capitalism] willdevelop to an enormous extent”, that “in fifty years we shallhave many Shanghais”, i. 
e. 
, huge centres of capitalist wealth and proletarian need and poverty. 
 But the question arises: does Sun Yat-sen, on the basis of his reactionary economic theory, uphold an actually reaction-ary agrarian programme? That is the crux of the matter,its most interesting point, and one on which curtailed and emasculated liberal quasi-Marxism is often at a loss. 
 The fact of the matter is that he does not. 
 The dialectics of the social relations in China reveals itself precisely inthe fact that, while sincerely sympathising with socialismin Europe, the Chinese democrats have transformed it intoa reactionary theory, and on the basis of this reactionary theory of “preventing” capitalism are championing a purely capitalist , a maximum capitalist, agrarian pro-gramme! Indeed, what does the “economic revolution”, of which Sun Yat-sen talks so pompously and obscurely at the begin-ning of his article, amount to? It amounts to the transfer of rent to the state, i. 
e. 
, land nationalisation, by some sort of single tax along Henry George lines. 
 There is absolutely nothing else that is real in the “economic revolution” proposed and advocated bySun Yat-sen. 
 The difference between the value of land in some remote peasant area and in Shanghai is the difference in the rate of rent. 
 The value of land is capitalised rent. 
 To make the “enhanced value” of land the “property of the people”means transferring the rent, i. 
e. 
, land ownership, to thestate, or, in other words, nationalising the land. 
 Is such a reform possible within the framework of capi-talism? It is not only possible but it represents the purest, most consistent, and ideally perfect capitalism. 
 Marx point-ed this out in The Poverty of Philosophy , he proved it in detail in Volume III of Capital , and developed it with partic-ular clarity in his controversy with Rodbertus in Theories of Surplus Value . 
 Land nationalisation makes it possible to abolish abso-lute rent, leaving only differential rent. 
 According to Marx’stheory, land nationalisation means a maximum eliminationof medieval monopolies and medieval relations in agri-culture, maximum freedom in buying and selling land, andmaximum facilities for agriculture to adapt itself to the market. 
 The irony of history is that Narodism, under the guise of “combating capitalism” in agriculture, championsan agrarian programme that, if fully carried out, would meanthe most rapid development of capitalism in agricul-ture. 
 What economic necessity is behind the spread of the most progressive bourgeois-democratic agrarian programmes in one of the most backward peasant countries of Asia? It isthe necessity of destroying feudalism in all its forms andmanifestations. 
 The more China lagged behind Europe and Japan, the more it was threatened with fragmentation and national disintegration. 
 It could be “renovated” only by the heroism of the revolutionary masses, a heroism capable of creatinga Chinese republic in the sphere of politics, and of ensuring,through land nationalisation, the most rapid capitalistprogress in the sphere of agriculture. 
 Whether and to what extent this will succeed is another question. 
 In their bourgeois revolutions, various countries achieved various degrees of political and agrarian democ-racy, and in the most diverse combinations. 
 The decisivefactors will be the international situation and the alignmentof the social forces in China. 
 The emperor will certainly tryto unite the feudal lords, the bureaucracy and the clergy in an attempt at restoration. 
 Yüan Shih-kai, who represents a bourgeoisie that has only just changed from liberal-monarchist to liberal-republican (for how long?), will pursuea policy of manoeuvring between monarchy and revolution. 
The revolutionary bourgeois democracy, represented by SunYat-sen, is correct in seeking ways and means of “renova-ting” China through maximum development of the initia-tive, determination and boldness of the peasant masses in thematter of political and agrarian reforms. 
 Lastly, the Chinese proletariat will increase as the number of Shanghais increases. 
 It will probably form some kind of Chinese Social-Democratic labour party which, while criticising the petty-bourgeois utopias and reactionaryviews of Sun Yat-sen, will certainly take care to single out,defend and develop the revolutionary-democratic core ofhis political and agrarian programme.

 Ilyin THE ITALIAN SOCIALIST CONGRESS A few days ago the Thirteenth Congress of the Italian Socialist Party came to a close in the town of Reggio Emilia. 
 The struggle within the Italian Socialist Party has as-sumed particularly sharp forms in recent years. 
 Originally there were two basic trends: revolutionary and reformist. 
The revolutionaries upheld the proletarian character of themovement and combated all manifestations of opportunism,i. 
e. 
, the spirit of moderation, deals with the bourgeoisieand renunciation of the ultimate (socialist) aims of the working-class movement. 
 The cardinal principle of this trend and the basis of its views are the class struggle. 
 The reformists, in fighting for reforms, i. 
e. 
, individual improvements of political and economic conditions, keptforgetting the socialist character of the movement. 
 Theyadvocated blocs and alliances with the bourgeoisie to the point of socialists entering bourgeois ministries, of renounc-ing consistently republican convictions (in monarchicalItaly, republican propaganda in itself is not consideredunlawful), of defending “colonial policy”, the policy ofseizing colonies, of oppressing, plundering and exterminatingthe natives, etc. 
 These two basic trends, which exist in one form or another in all socialist parties, gave rise in Italy to two further extreme trends that deviated completely from socialism andtended therefore to dissociate themselves from the workers’Socialist Party. 
 One of these non-socialist extremes issyndicalism , which became “fashionable” in Italy at one time. 
 The syndicalists inclined towards anarchism, slipped into revolutionary phrase-mongering, destroyed the disci-pline of the working-class struggle and opposed the use of the parliamentary platform by socialists, or upheld such opposition. 
 Anarchist influence is feeble everywhere, and the wor Ing-class movement is rapidly ridding itself of this sickness. 
 The Italian syndicalists (led by Arturo Labriola) are already outside the Socialist Party. 
 Their role in the working-class movement is negligible. 
 The Marxist revolutionariesin Italy, as in other countries, do not in the least indulge in anarchist sentiments and trends, which disrupt the pro-letarian movement. 
 The reformists are less staunch with regard to the extreme Right reformists who, by drifting to a liberal labour policy,pass completely into the liberal camp and desert to the bour-geoisie. 
 That is why the removal of these traitors to the working-class cause from the Socialist Party seldom takes place without the Marxist revolutionaries having to wagea most bitter struggle against all reformists. 
 This was the case in France, for example, where Millerand, an opportun-ist and reformist, ended by a deal with the bourgeoisieand entered a bourgeois Ministry. 
 The same is true of Italy. 
 There the reformists have split into Left reformists (led by Turati) and Right reformists(led by Bissolati). 
 The Reggio Emilia Congress marked thelast act of this split. 
 There were three trends at the Congress: (1) the revolu-tionaries (they had about 12,500 votes at the Congress, ac-cording to the number of their supporters in the Party); (2) the Left reformists (about 9,000), and (3) the Right re-formists (about 2,000). 
 The revolutionaries moved for ex-pelling Bissolati and another three extreme Right reformistsfrom the Party. 
 As for the Left reformists, one-third ofthem also favoured expulsion, but they wanted the reason for it to be expressed in “milder” terms, while two-thirds were against expulsion and for a mere censure. 
 The revolutionaries, who were in a majority, as the above figures show, gained the upper hand, and Bissolati and Co. 
were expelled. 
 What were Bissolati’s views and actions which necessi-tated his expulsion from the Party? Bissolati, in the face of numerous decisions of the Party, went so far in backingthe bourgeois Ministry as to almost become a minister without portfolio” himself (that is, not being a minister, he behaved like a supporter and member of the bourgeois Ministry). 
 Despite republican convictions, which Italian socialists strictly adhere to, Bissolati began to make trips to theQuirinal, where he visited the king and held negotiationswith him! He went as far as to defend Italy’s present waragainst Turkey, although the entire Party has emphatically condemned the war as shameless bourgeois plundering and a dirty business—massacring African natives in Tripoli bymeans of improved deadly weapons. 
 Following the expulsion of Bissolati and Co. 
, all the Right reformists left the Party and founded a party of their own , which they named the Socialist Reformist Party. 
 Behind that facade is in reality a “party” of liberal-mon-archist labour” politicians. 
 A split is something distressing and painful. 
 But some-times it becomes indispensable, and then all weakness, all“sentimentality” (a term used in Reggio by a compatriotof ours, Balabanova), is a crime. 
 The leaders of the working class are not angels, saints or heroes, but people like anyone else. 
 They make mistakes. 
 The Party puts them right. 
 TheGerman Workers’ Party sometimes had to correct the oppor-tunist errors of even such great leaders as Bebel. 
 But when someone persists in an error, when, to defend an error, a group is formed that spurns all the decisions of the party, all the discipline of the proletarian army, a split becomes indispensable. 
 And the party of the Italian social-ist proletariat has taken the right path by removing thesyndicalists and Right reformists from its ranks.

 the Pravda text “FREEDOM OF SPEECH ” IN RUSSIA The newspaper At Your Service , Sir, commonly known as Novoye Vremya , has reprinted a report received by its worthy colleague, Peterburgskiye Vedomosti , from Ivanovo-Voz-nesensk. 
 “In our industrial town,” says the report, “foul language in the street has supplanted human speech. 
 It is used by factory workersand cabbies and well-dressed people, and by policemen performingtheir official duties. 
” Commenting on this picture of mores, Novoye Vremya remarks: “A lucky workers’ town, where the most daring Social-Demo-cratic expectations of completely unrestricted freedom of speech have been realised. 
” How very instructive, this caddish sally, isn’t it? Surely it is common knowledge, gentlemen of the editorial board of a newspaper loyally serving the government, thatfreedom of speech with regard to foul language has been “realised” in the Third Duma precisely by those Right-wing parties closest to the government. 
 Surely everyone knowsthat the Purishkeviches, Markovs and their colleagues have become famous for this throughout Russia. 
 It is imprudent of Novoye Vremya to talk like that, very imprudent indeed. 
 Why, it could have played its servant’s role much more adroitly. 
 Yet here is a paper, one sincerely devoted to the government, suddenly reminding us of thekind of “freedom of speech” that Purishkevich and Co. 
 practise and the kind practised by the Social-Democratic deputies to the Duma. 
 Freedom of speech for the Purishkeviches in a landlord Duma, and freedom of speech at workers’ meetings.... 
 It isan excellent pre-election topic brought up by Novoye Vremya , which is so clumsy in its zealous servility! Pravda No.

 AXELROD EXPOSES THE LIQUIDATORS I P. 
 B. 
 Axelrod is destined to play an original role in the development of the opportunist trend among the Marxists. 
 His idea of a “labour congress”, for example, once made quite a stir. 
 A certain number of workers were attracted and carriedaway by his propaganda. 
 But the more widespread thatpropaganda became and the nearer the idea drew to beingput into effect, the clearer became the spurious character of the scheme, which fizzled out of itself. 
 Experience con-firmed what the Bolsheviks had pointed out more than once, namely, that Axelrod’s “ideas” are an invention of the oppor-tunist intelligentsia, a dream of how to “bypass” grim classand political struggles. 
 Exactly the same story has now been repeated with regard to the idea of a workers’ publishing house and a “non-fac-tional” workers’ newspaper. 
 Any St. 
 Petersburg worker will recall how much the liquidators made of that idea untilvery recently, how they tempted the workers with the dreamof “bypassing” all struggle among the worker democrats,and how comically they fumed against Zvezda because it showed that the issue of a liberal labour policy (think of the bakers’ decision 97) cannot be bypassed and that all talk about workers’ control over a non-factional newspaperis sheer demagogy. 
 And now Axelrod, writing in the liquidationist Nevsky Golos No. 
 6, has excellently exposed—has had to expose— the demagogy of his own friends. 
 Demagogy means lavishing promises that cannot be fulfilled. 
 The idea of a broad labour congress, a legal workers’ publishing house and a non-factional workers’ newspaper is tempting. 
 But the point is that these tempting things cannot be achieved without first waging a stubborn and difficult struggle for political liberty in general, for the victory of Marxism among the worker democrats, etc. 
 Demagogic promises are easy to give. 
 Butlife soon shows that they cannot be fulfilled, and exposesthe opportunism of “rosy dreams”. 
 In Nevsky Golos No. 
 6, Axelrod dishes up an amazing amount of empty declamation, asserting, for instance, that he and his friends are “progressive spokesmen of the Party”, while their opponents are “reactionaries”. 
 Of course, Axel-rod likes very much to think so, and the liquidators liketo print what he thinks. 
 Only, what cheap talk it is! Praisinghimself for his “progressive” attitude .... 
 Would it not be better to explain the substance and meaning of the diver-gencies? “The idea of a non-factional Social-Democratic (genuinely Social-Democratic, without inverted commas) organ is utopian at presentand, moreover, a utopia that objectively runs counter to the interestsof the Party’s political development and the organisational unifi-cation of the proletariat under the banner of Social-Democracy. 
Drive Nature out of the door and she will fly in through the window and the cracks. 
” That is what Axelrod writes. 
 Those are not bad ideas at all. 
 They are perfectly sound in principle. 
 They show thatAxelrod’s liquidationist friends were quite wrong whenyesterday they were still putting out among the mass ofthe workers the very idea which Axelrod now condemns. 
 Only, we cannot regard the lavishing of unrealisable promises as a “progressive” attitude. 
 “We may be said to have no factions that have taken shape organi-sationally,” writes Axelrod. 
 “Instead, we have various circles andsmall groups, of which some hold more or less definite political, tac-tical and organisational views, while the others waver in variousdirections, getting in the way of the former. 
” The first sentence is not entirely correct. 
 Axelrod knows very well that there is something which has fully taken shape organisationally—as far as that is possible nowadays. 
But the second is correct: there are many small groups that are wavering and are getting in the way of the others. 
 By stating this truth under the compulsion of events, Axelrod exposes his friends again. 
 Everyone is aware that what Axel-rod’s friends are just now making a display of is ostentatious “unification” on paper of the wavering little groups. 
 Do they not promise this fictitious “unification” of all the liqui-dators and all the waverers in the very same No. 
 6 of Nevsky Golos ? “The focal point and main source of the discord,” Axelrod con-tinues, “is, on the one hand, the difference in the attitude of the various Party circles to the new, open Social-Democratic labour movement [shouldn’t you have said to the open Party , esteemed P. 
 B. 
 Axelrod? It is a bad thing to distort the essence of the diver-gency!] and, on the other hand, substantial differences over imme-diate political tasks and the political tactics of the Russian Social-Democratic movement. 
 The requirements of both these categories are becoming particularly burning and topical issues just now when a new social and political movement is beginning. 
 And it is overthem that the Russian Social-Democrats have split into two maincamps. 
 The question arises whether the projected labour newspaperwill be able to take a neutral position between these two opposedcamps, and whether such a position is permissible in principle. 
 Ob-viously not. 
”... A very correct conclusion. 
 Axelrod has given a good thrash-ing not only to those of his friends who yesterday wereclamouring for a neutral and non-factional newspaper,but also to those who today are assuring naïve people oftheir “agreement”, “unity”, solidarity, and so on, with the neutral little groups. 
 There are indeed two main camps. 
 One of them has com-pletely taken shape organisationally. 
 Its answers to all thequestions listed by Axelrod are quite formal, precise anddefinite, unlike the desultory and contradictory little arti-cles of certain writers. 
 As for the other camp, i. 
e. 
, the liq-uidationist camp, to which Axelrod belongs, it has admit-tedly not taken shape organisationally (what we have in-stead is only hollow promises of an open labour party , only talk about open political societies of the workers, whichare even less feasible than a labour congress would have beenin 1906-07), nor can it answer, in specific and precise terms, the questions listed by Axelrod himself (what we have in-stead of specific answers is only the journalistic exercisesof Yezhov, Levitsky, Klenov, Chatsky, and others). 
 “As soon as a working group of publishers and journalists makes up its mind to put forward a specific programme of action, to take a definite stand on questions relating, say, to the election campaign, to put particular tasks and slogans before the workers in the campaignand declare itself for a particular tactic towards the different politi-cal parties—as soon, I say, as a publishing association decides to lend its publication the character of an essentially proletarian political organ, it will be faced with the same vexed questions and differencesthat worry and rend asunder the Russian Social-Democracy. 
 Andthen it may happen that that association itself will become a newsource of the same kind of discord, unless its members come to termsand reach agreement on these questions beforehand. 
” Axelrod hits out at the liquidators very correctly and very well. 
 What the “association” needs, Nasha Zarya a nd Nevsky Golos need still more badly. 
 Then why cannot they come to terms on the vexed questions and differences ? Why cannot they give precise answers at least to the more impor-tant questions listed by Axelrod (the attitude to different parties, the tasks, slogans and tactics)? “Physician, cure thyself. 
” Axelrod has so well explained to the workers the need for clear and precise answers to the “vexed questions” that the writers of Nasha Zarya and Nevsky Golos (and, perhaps, not only Nevsky Golos ) ought to heed his words. 
 One cannot do without precise and clear answers to the “vexed questions”, cannot confine oneselfto articles—that would indeed be the circle spirit. 
 Deci-sions —precise, formal, well-considered, and definite deci-sions—are needed. 
 After all, it is not for nothing that Axel-rod speaks—and very aptly!—of a specific programme of action , of tasks and slogans , etc. 
 Incidentally, the reason why the liquidators are called liquidators is that, while they have rejected the old, theyoffer nothing new. 
 That an open party is useful, and thatopen political societies are necessary, is something whichall liquidators have been dinning into our ears. 
 But this talk of theirs is not all that is required, and as for action , there is no evidence of it, none whatsoever. 
 There is noevidence of precisely what Axelrod demands from the work-ers! In the Nevsky Golos feuilleton, below the dividing line, Axelrod has given excellent evidence exposing the liquida-tors who write above the dividing line , in the editorial section of the paper. 
 Read Axelrod’s feuilleton carefully and youwill see that it is deception and self-deception for the liquidators to shout about “agreement” concerning an election platform, a “single” platform, etc. 
 “A Zvezda Supporter” has already exposed this deception in Nevskaya Zvezda No. 
 16. 
 But the exposure provided by Axelrod goes even deeper and is still more valuable becauseit comes from Axelrod. 
 We are entirely in favour of a single platform—namely, the one which the Bolsheviks and pro-Party Mensheviks adopted long ago, and are putting into effect, as “A Zvezda Supporter” justly points out. 
 We are entirely in favour of asingle election campaign precisely on that platform, on the basis of these same decisions, of definite and precise answersto all the “vexed questions”. 
 By shouting about “unity”, the liquidators seek to carry away ignorant workers by the mere sound of the word. 
 “Unity” is agreeable, “non-factional newspapers” are moreattractive! But read Axelrod at least , and he will make it clear to you that non-factionalism is impossible , that it is utopian; that there are two camps among the worker democrats, and that these two camps are opposed . 
 What now? Are the liquidators by any chance going to defend a “platform” in order to conceal their views?—a diplomatic platform, such as the bourgeoisie likes so much?— a platform that does not furnish any answers to the “vexedquestions” but is “simply” and “merely” concerned with “getting into the Duma ”? That would be the height of unprincipledness. 
 But the workers would never accept it. 
 Such platforms, no matterhow “open”, could not hold their own even for a single day. 
 Yes, we have had enough of self-deception. 
 It is time we faced up to the truth, which this time has also been plainlyacknowledged by the leader of the liquidators, Axelrod. 
 If you, liquidator gentlemen, choose to insist on a platform of your “own” (although you have yet to put it forward,and we do not believe in platforms concocted six weeksbefore elections!), if you choose to insist on tactics of your“own” (although so far you have nowhere stated themprecisely, formally, in a manner befitting a party!), then you alone are to blame. 
 Then it is you who violate the unity that is there already . 
 Then it is you who will be held entirely responsible for that violation. 
 Yes, we have had enough of self-deception. 
 Liquidationist cries about “unity” are no more than a blind. 
 Knowing very well that the workers are against them, the liquidators are equally well aware what a complete, shattering defeattheir separate action would bring them. 
 That is why theyare willing to promise anything as long as they are electedto the Duma. 
 That will not do. 
 Only the bourgeois behave in that way. 
 Worker democrats believe only in programmes, decisions, tactics and slogans that have been put into effect for years before the elections and are merely repeated for the hun-dredth time during the elections. 
 As for those who make upmeaningless “platforms” without such decisions , just for the elections, they deserve no confidence whatever. 
 Axelrod’s feuilleton is useful as a means of destroying all self-deception, of enlightening the various concocters of“new”, “open”, “common” platforms. 
 II The closing part of Axelrod’s article, of which we spoke in Nevskaya Zvezda No. 
 18, has now appeared in Nasha Zarya . 
 Taken as a whole, that final part has fully borne out ourappraisal, and we can merely repeat that Axelrod’s articleis useful as a means of destroying all self-deception, of re-vealing the real nature of liquidationism, of appreciating the sheer inanity of the vaunted “non-factionalism” whichtoday is being made so much of, and so very uselessly, incertain quarters. 
 Axelrod hits out at Trotsky, who is now in alliance (is it a stable one?) with the liquidators, in a particularly elo-quent and convincing fashion. 
 “The ideological and organi-sational union of the progressive elements into an independ-ent faction,” writes Axelrod, who amuses himself by callingthe liquidators Party progressives and calling us Partyreactionaries, “is—in view of the present state of affairs—their direct duty and pressing task. 
” “In this situation in the Party, to talk of ‘non-factionalism’ as the sole remedy means behaving like the ostrich, which buries its head insand at the approach of danger; it means deceiving oneself and others as to the actual state of affairs among the Social-Democrats. 
” ( Nasha Zarya No. 
 6, p. 
 15. 
) Poor Trotsky! It is downright cruel and ungracious of Axelrod to inveigh against a true friend of the liquidatorsand a contributor to N asha Zarya in this way. 
 What are we to expect now? Will Trotsky come out with a devastating articleagainst the factionalist Axelrod, or will Martov reconcilethe conciliator Trotsky with the factionalist Axelrod by pasting together, as usual, what is falling apart with a dozen plastering reservations? Really, how can anyone speak seriously now of the vaunted bloc * of Trotsky, and the Lettish and Jewish near-Marxists, etc. 
, with Axelrod? Axelrod’s article contains a point that is worthy of serious analysis, namely, the one on the “Europeanisation” of our Social-Democratic movement. 
 But before passing to thatpoint, it is necessary to say a few words about one of themethods of the liquidators. 
 One page in Axelrod’s article (16) is a collection of the strongest, most vicious and choicest terms of abuse, against the anti-liquidators in general and this writer in particular. 
 It would not be worth replying to abuse at all (a person inAxelrod ‘s position can do nothing but revile and curse)but for documentary evidence indicating that some delib-erately use such abuse while others are embarrassed by it. 
 Mr. 
 Chernov, for example, replying in Zavety 98 to what Kamenev says to prove that he, leader of the “Left” Narod-niks, is drifting from democracy to liberalism, selects abunch of the most abusive expressions of the liquidators andanti-liquidators, chuckling as he does so. 
 Mr. 
 Chernov’smethod is so despicable that it suffices to point to it andpass on. 
 No struggle over principles waged by groups within the Social-Democratic movement anywhere in the world has managed to avoid a number of personal and organisationalconflicts. 
 Nasty types make it their business deliberately topick on “conflict” expressions. 
 But only weak-nerved dilet-tanti from among “sympathisers” can be embarrassed by *Axelrod’s article is dated May 17, 1912, or five months after the solemn formation of the Trotskyist and liquidationist bloc to fight the anti-liquidators under the banner of “non-factionalism”! these conflicts, can shrug them off in despair or in scorn, as if to say “it is all a squabble!” Those who take a serious interest in the working-class movement always learn—it is possible and necessary to learn it, is only by studying thehistorical role of the great leaders of the working-classmovement—to distinguish between the “conflict” aspect ofthe struggle of ideas , of the struggle of trends, and that aspect of it which is a matter of principle. 
 People will always be people, and no historical clash between the Marxist and the anarchist trends (Marx and Bakunin), between the Guesdistand the Jaurèsist, between the Lassallean and the Eisenachtrends, etc. 
, has ever managed to do without “conflict” ma-terial, without “squabbles”. 
 There still exists a nasty type of writers who deliberately select “from those days” bunches of accusations of a thousand and one dishonesties, etc. 
 But there are serious Social-Demo-crats who lay bare the ideological roots of the differences, which in the splits of particular groups, in the circumstancesof political exile, etc. 
, inevitably took the form of conflictsin the nature of desperate squabbles. 
 Let the reader not imagine that we want to frighten anyone away from studying the data to which Axelrod alludes—merely alludes—in the more abusive passages of his article. 
Quite the reverse. 
 We invite those who want to know every-thing about the Social-Democratic movement to studythose data. 
 They are available in complete form abroad, and they include not only passionate accusations, but also doc-uments and evidence by neutral persons. 
 A study of thosedocuments and that evidence will supply an answer to thequestion why the attempt to establish complete peace be-tween the liquidators and the anti-liquidators, made in Janu-ary 1910, ended in failure. 
 ____ One of the more interesting passages of fundamental importance in Axelrod’s article is the following: “To organise and unite as a faction is a direct obligation and pressing task of the advocates of a reform, or rather [listen to this!] revolution, in the Party, for this is the only way in which they will be able to accomplish their task—to Europeanise, i. 
e. 
, radicallychange the character of, the Russian Social-Democratic movement as it took shape in the pre-revolutionary period and developed fur-ther in the revolutionary period, and organise it on the same principleson which the European Social-Democratic party system is based. 
” And so, the liquidators advocate a revolution in the Party. 
 This exceptionally truthful statement of Axelrod’s is worthyof note, for the bitter truth is more useful than deceit that“uplifts us”, 99 and more valuable than diplomatic quibbles and reservations. 
 Try to carry out a revolution in the Party, esteemed P. 
 B. 
 Axelrod! We shall see whether you and your friends will be more successful than those “revolution-aries” who only a short time ago tried to accomplisha “revolution” (against the republic) in Portugal. 
 100 But the chief thing in the statement just quoted is the vaunted “Europeanisation”, which is being talked about in every possible tone by Dan and Martov and Trotsky and Levitsky and all the liquidators. 
 It is one of the main pointsof their opportunism. 
 “To Europeanise, i. 
e. 
, radically change the character of, the Russian Social-Democratic movement .... 
” Think over these words. 
 What determines the “character” of any Social-Democratic movement and radical changes in it? The gen-eral economic and political conditions of the country con-cerned, without a doubt. 
 And there is no doubt that the char-acter of the Social-Democratic movement of a people can beradically changed only if those conditions undergo radical changes. 
 These are all most elementary and indisputable truths. 
 But it is these truths that expose Axelrod’s opportunisterror! The trouble with him is that he wants to bypass a stubborn and grim struggle for a radical change in Russian political conditions, which has not yet taken place, bydreaming of a radical change in the “character of the Rus-sian Social-Democratic movement”. 
 Just as the Cadets, who readily talk about Europeanisa-tion (the liquidators have borrowed both the Cadets’ catch-word and their ideas), by means of this loose term pushinto the background an exact concept of the solid founda-tions of political liberty and “ play ” at “constitutional oppo-sition”, so the liquidators play at “European Social-Democ-racy”, although—in the country where they amuse them-selves with their game—there is as yet no constitution, as yet no basis for “Europeanism”, and a stubborn struggle has yet to be waged for them. 
 A naked savage who put on a top-hat and imagined him-self therefore to be a European would look rather ridicu-lous. 
 Milyukov, a supporter of the bourgeoisie, remindsone of just such a savage when he asserts in the Third Dumathat “we have a constitution, thank God”, and so doesAxelrod, a supporter of the workers, when he puts on a top-hat inscribed “I am a European Social-Democrat”. 
 Both of them—Milyukov as well as Axelrod—are ridiculous in theirnaïveté. 
 They are both opportunists, for, by uttering dreamyphrases about “Europeanism”, they evade the difficult andurgent question of how a particular class, in non-Europeanconditions, ought to act for a stubborn struggle to secure a basis for Europeanism. 
 Axelrod has proved by his article that the result is evasion of a vital and urgent matter by means of dreamy phrases. 
Trotsky has prepared a perfectly European—yes, truly andperfectly European—plan for setting up a “ press committee ” as an “elected collective control body” of the workers for working-class newspapers (p. 
 18 of Axelrod’s article). 
 Trots-ky probably even consulted “European Social-Democrats”about this and received their blessing as a gift—a blessingwhich he makes a great deal of. 
 And now the “European Social-Democrat” Axelrod, after waiting two months or so, during which Trotsky plagued all the St. 
 Petersburg Social-Democrats with his letters about “elected collective control bodies”, making everyone laugh,has at last taken pity on Trotsky and explained to him thata “press committee” is no good and is impossible, and thatwhat is needed instead is an “ agreement ” between the workers and the liquidationist Zhivoye Dyelo (pp. 
 18 and 19 of Axel-rod’s article)!! This is a small example, and we must unfortunately con-fine ourselves to it. 
 But it is a very typical one. 
 The laugh-able result produced by Trotsky’s “European” plan for a“press committee” is also being produced by the “European”plans of all the liquidators for an “open workers’ party” or “legal political societies of the workers”, for a “campaign” for “freedom of association”, etc. 
 The only result of Trotsky’s “European” plans for a “press committee”, an “elected collective control body” for the working-class newspaper “of all the working-class organi-sations that have taken shape”, etc. 
, is that the legalist game of a “workers’ publishing house” has taught the workersa special lesson, while the liquidators have in fact failed to produce either a “press committee” or a working-class press! These are the facts. 
 The “press committee” was a dream of the opportunist intellectual who, ignoring the difficult non-European con-ditions of the working-class movement in Russia, drew up asplendid European plan and took advantage of the occasionto boast of his “Europeanism” to the whole world. 
 This bitter lot of the liquidators is not accidental, it is inevitable. 
 As soon as their “European” plans come near to being realised, they turn out to be soap bubbles, inven-tions of opportunist intellectuals. 
 This was the case with thelabour congress, the “press committee”, the workers’ legalpolitical society (the confused little reservations by whichMartov seeks to “rescue” that “plan” in Nasha Zarya No. 
 5 do not improve matters in the least) and the campaign for freedom of association. 
 The liquidators describe as “Europeanism” the conditions in which the Social-Democrats have been active in the prin-cipal countries of Europe since 1871 , i. 
e. 
, precisely at the time when the whole historical period of bourgeois revolu-tions was over and when the foundations of political lib-erty had taken firm shape for a long time to come. 
 The “change in the character” of the Social-Democratic movementin those countries occurred, firstly, after a radical change in political conditions—after a definite constitutional systemhad been firmly established, comparatively speaking;secondly, that change was only a temporary one, for a definite period (which has lately been nearing its end, as is general-ly acknowledged by the most cautious Social-Democrats ofEurope). 
 In these conditions of fully established bourgeois consti-tutionalism, a campaign for, say, freedom of association oruniversal suffrage, and for constitutional reforms in general, could be, under certain circumstances, a campaign of the working class, a real political campaign, a real struggle forconstitutional reforms. 
 In our country, however, opportunist intellectuals trans-plant the slogans of such “European” campaigns to a soil lacking the most elementary foundations of European con-stitutionalism, in an attempt to bypass the specific historical evolution which usually precedes the laying of these foun-dations. 
 The difference between the reformism of our Axelrod and his friends, who pose as “European Social-Democrats”, and the reformism of Bissolati, that genuine European, is that Bissolati sacrifices the principles of the class struggleand of consistent Marxist theory and practice for the sake of reforms which are really effected (with certain curtailments) by the really dominant liberal bourgeoisie. 
 Axelrod, how-ever, makes the same sacrifice as Bissolati for the sake of reforms which impotent, light-minded, dreamy liberals merely prattle about. 
 The liberal bourgeoisie here in Russia will become a real force only when the development of the country overcomesthe liberals’ timidity and their conciliatory, half-heartedslogans. 
 That is how it has been everywhere. 
 Liberals become a power only when the democracy has won in spite of the lib-erals.

 Marxism and Liquidationism , Part II, St. 
 Petersburg, 1914 THE RESULT S OF SIX MONTH S’ WOR K101 By founding a workers’ daily newspaper, the workers of St. 
 Petersburg have accomplished a major feat, one that without exaggeration can be called historic. 
 The workers’ democratic movement has rallied together and consolidateditself in incredibly difficult conditions. 
 Of course, it is notpossible to talk of the stability of the workers’ democratic press in our country. 
 Everyone knows very well the perse-cution to which working-class newspapers are subjected. 
 For all that, the founding of Pravda is an outstanding proof of the political consciousness, energy and unity ofthe Russian workers. 
 It is useful to look back and note some results of the six months’ work of the Russian workers for founding a press oftheir own . 
 Since January of this year the interest shown by working-class circles of St. 
 Petersburg in their press hasbecome fully evident and a number of articles dealing witha workers’ daily has appeared in newspapers of all shadesthat come into contact with the world of labour. 
 I Data on who founded a daily working-class press in Russia and how it was founded are, fortunately, available in a comparatively full form. 
 They are the data on the collec-tion of funds for a workers’ daily newspaper. 
 Let us begin with the funds with which Pravda was brought into being. 
 We have the accounts of Zvezda , Nevskaya Zvezda and Pravda for the period from January 1 to June 30, or exactly six months. 
 Publicity ensured the absolute accuracy of the accounts, accidental errors being corrected immediately on indications from those concerned. 
 What is of the greatest importance and interest to us is not the sum total of the funds collected, but the composition of the givers . 
 When, for example, Nevskaya Zvezda No. 
 3 gave the total contributions for a workers’ daily newspaperas 4,288 rubles 84 kopeks (from January to May 5, exclusiveof the donations which from April 22, the day when Pravda first appeared, came directly to that newspaper), we were at once prompted to ask: what was the role which the workersthemselves and groups of workers played in collecting thissum? Does it consist of large donations by sympathisers?Or did the workers themselves show in this case a personaland active concern for the working-class press and make up a large sum out of donations from a large number of workers’ groups? From the point of view of the initiative and energy of the workers themselves , it is much more important to have 100 rubles collected by, say, 30 groups of workers than1,000 rubles collected by some dozens of “sympathisers”. 
 A newspaper founded on the basis of five-kopek pieces col-lected by small factory circles of workers is a far moredependable, solid and serious undertaking (both financially and, most important of all , from the standpoint of the de-velopment of the workers’ democratic movement) than a news-paper founded with tens and hundreds of rubles contributed by sympathising intellectuals. 
 To obtain exact data on this fundamental and most important matter, we have performed the following opera-tion with regard to the figures on collections published inthe three newspapers mentioned. 
 We have singled out only the donations stated to have been made by groups of fac-tory or office workers. 
 What we are interested in at the moment is the contri-butions made by the workers themselves —moreover, not by individual ones, who may have come across a collector bychance, not being linked with him ideologically, i. 
e. 
, interms of their views and convictions; we mean groups o f workers, who must no doubt have discussed beforehand whether they should donate any money, whom they should give it to and for what purpose.

 Reduced First page of Pravda No.

 Reduced Each report by Zvezda , Nevskaya Zvezda or Pravda which indicated that the money contributed for a workers’ daily came from a group of factory or office workers, we assumed to be a group contribution by the workers themselves. 
 How many such group contributions by workers were there in the first half of 1912? Five hundred and four group contributions!More than five hundred times, groups of workers made contributions for the founding and maintenance of their paper, either donating what they had earned in one day, ormaking a single contribution, or contributing repeatedlyfrom time to time. 
 In addition to individual workers andsympathisers, 504 groups of workers took a most active part in founding their newspaper. 
 This figure is an unquestion-able indication that a deep and conscious interest in a workers’ newspaper has been aroused among the mass o f the workers—and not just in any workers’ paper, but in aworkers’ democratic paper. 
 Since the masses are so politi-cally conscious and active, no difficulties or obstacles canfrighten us. 
 There are not, and cannot be, difficulties or obstacles which the political consciousness, activity and interest of the mass of the workers would be unable toovercome in some way or another. 
 Those 504 group contributions break down by months as follows: January 1912 .......... 
. 
 14 February ”.......... 
. 
 18 March ”.......... 
. 
 76 April ”.......... 
. 
 227 May ”.......... 
. 
 135 June ”.......... 
. 
 34 Six-month total ....... 
. 
 504 This little table makes clear, incidentally, the great importance of April and May as a period of radical change . 
 From darkness to light, from passivity to activity, fromaction by individuals to action by the masses. 
 In January and February group contributions by the workers were as yet quite insignificant. 
 Obviously, the ac-tivity was only just beginning. 
 March showed a noticeable and substantial rise. 
 Seventy-six group contributions by workers in one month—this indicates at all events a serious movement among the workers, a tenacious effort by the masses to have their way at all costs, undeterred by having to make donations. 
 This speaks of the workers’ deep confi-dence in their own strength and in the undertaking as a whole,in the trend of the projected newspaper, and so on. 
 In Marchthere was as yet no workers’ daily, which means that groupsof workers were collecting money and giving it to Zvezda , as it were, on credit. 
 April brought an enormous leap that decided the matter. 
 Two hundred and twenty-seven group contributions byworkers in one month, an average of over seven contribu-tions a day! The dam had been broken, and the founding ofa workers’ daily paper was assured. 
 Every group contri-bution means not merely the sum of five-kopek and ten-kopek pieces, but something far more important—the sumof combined, massed energy, the determination of groups t o support a workers’ newspaper, to disseminate and guideit, to bring it into being through their own participation. 
 The question may arise: were not the April contributions greatest after the 22nd, i. 
e. 
, after Pravda had appeared? No, they were not. 
 Before April 22, Zvezda reported 188 group contributions . 
 Between the 22nd and the end of April, Pravda reported 39 group contributions. 
 This means that during21 days of April, before Pravda had appeared, there was an average of nine contributions a day, while the last nine days of April saw only four contributions a day by groups. 
 Two important conclusions follow from this:Firstly, the workers were particularly active before the appearance of Pravda . 
 By giving money “on credit”, showing their confidence in Zvezda , the workers expressed their de-termination to have their way. 
 Secondly, it is seen that it was the April effort of the work-ers that brought the workers’ newspaper, Pravda , into being. 
 There can be no doubt as to the closest connectionbetween the general upswing of the working-class movement(not in a narrow guild, narrow trade union sense, but with ascope affecting all the people ) and the founding of the daily newspaper of the St. 
 Petersburg worker democrats. 
 We need something more than trade union publications, weneed a political newspaper of our own—this is what the masses realised more and more in April; what we need is not just any political workers’ newspaper, but a newspaper of the foremost worker democrats; we need a newspaper not only to promote our working-class struggle, but also toprovide a model and a beacon for the whole people. 
 In May the upswing was still very marked. 
 Group con-tributions averaged more than four a day. 
 On the one hand,it was an indication of the general upswing in April-May. 
 On the other, the mass of the workers realised that, al-though the publication of a daily newspaper had alreadybegun, its position would be particularly difficult at firstand group support particularly necessary. 
 In June the number of group contributions fell below the March figure. 
 Of course, the fact has to be taken into con-sideration that after the workers’ daily newspaper had begun to appear another form of assistance to the newspaper arose and acquired decisive significance, namely, subscrip-tion to it and its circulation among fellow-workers, acquaint-ances, countrymen, etc. 
 The politically-conscious friendsof Pravda do not limit themselves to subscribing to the paper but pass it on or send it to others as a sample, to make it known at other factories, in neighbouring flats or houses,in the countryside and so on. 
 Unfortunately, we have no wayof obtaining complete statistics on this kind of group as-sistance. 
 II It will be most instructive to see how those 504 contri-butions by groups of workers are distributed among towns and factory localities. 
 In what parts of Russia and how read-ily did the workers respond to the appeal to help in found-ing a workers’ daily newspaper? Fortunately, data on this are available for all of the work-ers’ group contributions reported by Zvezda , Nevskaya Zvezda and Pravda . 
 In summing up these data, we must first of all single out St. 
 Petersburg, which naturally has taken the lead in thematter of founding a workers’ newspaper, then fourteen towns and factory localities which sent in contributions from more than one group of workers, and lastly, all the other towns, thirty-five in all, which sent in only one group contribution each during the six months. 
 This is the picture we obtain: Total of group contributions St. 
 Petersburg ............ 412 14 towns with 2 to 12 group contributions each ............. 
. 
 57 35 towns with 1 group contribution each 35 Total for 50 towns ....... 
. 
 504 This shows that almost the whole of Russia took an active part, to some extent or another, in founding a workers’daily. 
 Considering the difficulties which the circulation of the workers’ democratic press encounters in the provinces, it is amazing that so large a number of towns should have responded within six months to the appeal of the St. 
 Pe-tersburg workers. 
 Ninety-two group contributions by workers in forty-nine towns of Russia, * besides the capital, is a very impressive figure, at least for a beginning. 
 There can be no question here of chance, indifferent, passive givers; these are un-doubtedly representatives of the proletarian masses, peopleunited by conscious sympathy for the workers’ democraticmovement although scattered throughout Russia. 
 We note that the list of provincial towns is headed by Kiev with 12 group contributions, then comes Yekaterino-slav with 8, while Moscow with 6 is only in the fourth place. 
This lag of Moscow and its entire area can be seen still moreclearly from the following summary data on all the areasof Russia: *Here is a complete list of the towns and localities: Vicinity of St. 
 Petersburg : Kronstadt, Kolpino and Sestroretsk. 
 South : Khar-kov, 4 group contributions; Yekaterinoslav, 8; Ananyev, 2; Lugansk,3; Kherson, Rostov-on-Don, Pavlograd, Poltava; Kiev, 12; Astrakhan,4, Chernigov; Yuzovka, 3; Minakovo, Shcherba Mine, Rykov Mine,Belgorod, Yelisavetgrad, Yekaterinodar; Mariupol, 2; Nizhne-Dne-provsk and Nakhichevan.

 13 North and West ................... 
. 
 12 Urals and Volga region .................. 6 Caucasus, Siberia and Finland ............... 7 Total for Russia .................. 504 These data may be interpreted as follows: In terms of renewed activity of the worker democrats in Russia, proletarian St. 
 Petersburg has already awakened and is at its glorious post. 
 The South is awakening. 
 Mother Moscow, however, and the rest of Russia are still asleep. 
It is time she awoke too. 
 The lag of the entire Moscow area becomes obvious when that area is compared with the other provincial areas. 
 The South is farther from St. 
 Petersburg, much farther away than Moscow. 
 Nevertheless, the South, which has fewer industrial workers than the Moscow area, exceeds that areaalmost fourfold in the number of group contributions by workers. 
 Moscow seems to be lagging behind even the Urals and the Volga region, for the number of workers in Moscow and its area exceeds their number in the Urals and the Volga region not twice, but many times over. 
 Yet Moscow and its areamade only 13 group contributions against 6 in the Uralsand the Volga region. 
 There are probably two special reasons for the lag of Mos-cow and its area. 
 Firstly, the dominant industry here is the textile industry, in which the economic situation, i. 
e. 
,market conditions and conditions for a more or less consider-able increase in production, has been worse than, say, inmetallurgy. 
 That is why textile workers participated lessin strikes and showed less interest in politics and in theworkers’ democratic movement. 
 Secondly, in the Moscowarea there are more factories scattered over out-of-the-waylocalities and therefore less accessible to newspapers thanin the big city. 
 In any case, we must undoubtedly draw a lesson from the data cited above. 
 The closest attention must be paid to the circulation of the workers’ newspaper in Moscow. 
 We cannot put up with the lag of Moscow. 
 Every politically-consciousworker realises that St. 
 Petersburg without Moscow is likeone hand without the other. 
 The bulk of Russia’s factory workers is concentrated in Moscow and its area. 
 In 1905, for instance, according to gov-ernment statistics, there were 567,000 factory workers here, i. 
e. 
, more than one-third of Russia’s total (1,660,000), and many more than in the St. 
 Petersburg area (298,000). 
The Moscow area is therefore destined to take the first place for the number of readers and friends of a workers’newspaper, for the number of politically-conscious repre-sentatives of the workers’ democratic movement. 
 Moscow will, of course, have to have a workers’ daily newspaper of its own . 
 Meanwhile St. 
 Petersburg must help it. 
 Every morning the readers of Pravda should tell themselves and their friends: “Workers, remember the Muscovites!” III The above data should draw our attention from yet an-other standpoint, one that is very important and urgent asregards our practical tasks. 
 Everyone realises that a political newspaper is one of the basic conditions for the participation of any class of modern society in the political affairs of thecountry in general and in an election campaign in particular. 
 Thus, a newspaper is required by the workers in general, and for carrying out elections to the Fourth Duma in partic-ular. 
 The workers know very well that they can expect no good either from the Third or from the Fourth Duma. 
 But we must take part in the elections, firstly, to rally andpolitically enlighten the mass of the workers during theelections, when party struggles and the entire political lifewill be stimulated and when the masses will learn politics in one way or other; and, secondly, to get our worker depu-ties into the Duma. 
 Even in the most reactionary Duma, in a purely landlord one, worker deputies have done , and can do, a great deal for the working-class cause, provided they are true worker democrats, provided they are connected with the masses and the masses learn to direct them and check on their activity. 
 In the first half of 1912 all the political parties in Russia began, and virtually completed , what is known as the pre-election mobilisation of the party forces. 
 Mobilisation is a military term. 
 It means putting the army in a state ofreadiness for action. 
 Just as an army is put in a state of readiness before a war, the reserves being called up and arms and ammunition distributed, so, before an election, allparties sum up their work, reaffirm their decisions on partyviews and slogans, rally their forces and prepare to fightall the other parties. 
 This work, we repeat, is virtually completed. 
 The elections are only a few weeks off. 
 During this time we can and must bend our energies to increase our influence on thevoters, on the masses, but if a party (the party of any class)has not got ready in six months, nothing can help it anylonger, for it is already a zero in the elections. 
 That is why the six months which our statistics cover are six months of decisive mobilisation of the workers’ forces prior to the Fourth Duma elections. 
 They have been sixmonths of mobilisation of all the forces of the worker demo-crats—of course, not only with regard to the Duma campaign,but we are for the moment devoting our attention to thelatter. 
 A question arises at this point, a question raised recently by Nevskaya Zvezda No. 
 16, and Pravda No. 
 61. 
 It concerns the so-called liquidators, who since January 1912 have beenpublishing the newspapers Zhivoye Dyelo and Nevsky Golos in St. 
 Petersburg. 
 The liquidators, who have their own sep-arate newspapers, say that “agreement” has to be reached with them, the liquidators, if there is to be “unity” of the worker democrats in the elections, otherwise they try tofrighten us with the prospect of “duplicate candidates”. 
 102 It seems that these attempts at intimidation have so far had very little success. 
 And this is quite understandable. 
 How could anyone seriously take into account people who have rightly earned the name of liquidators and advocates of a liberal labourpolicy? But perhaps there are, nevertheless, many workers who follow the erroneous, un-Social-Democratic views of this group of intellectuals? If so, ought we not to pay special attention to these workers? We now have objective, openand quite precise data for an answer to this question. 
 Aswe know, throughout the first half of 1912 the liquidatorsshowed particular vigour in attacking Pravda , Nevskaya Zvezda , Zvezda , and all opponents of liquidationism in general. 
 How successful were the liquidators among the workers? We can judge this from the contributions for a workers;daily newspaper published in the liquidationist newspapersZhivoye Dyelo and Nevsky Golos . 
 The liquidators recognised the need for a daily very long ago—in 1911 or perhaps even 1910—and advocated the idea most energetically among their supporters. 
 In February 1912 Zhivoye Dyelo , which was first issued on January 20, began to carry reports on thecontributions it received for this purpose. 
 Let us single out from those contributions (which totalled 139. 
27 rubles in the first half of 1912) group contributions by workers , just as we did in the case of the non-liquidationist papers. 
 Let us sum up all the sixteen issues of Zhivoye Dyelo and the five issues of Nevsky Golos (its issue No. 
 6 appeared in July), and even add contributions for the benefit ofZhivoye Dyelo itself (although we did not take data on such contributions from the non-liquidationist papers). 
 We obtain the following data on the total of group contributions by workers in six months: Number of group contributions by workers for a workers ’ daily newspaper during the first half of 1912 Non-liqui-Liquida-dationist tionist newspapers newspapers January ............ 14 0 February ............ 18 0 March ............. 
 76 7 April ............. 
 227 8 May ............. 
 135 0 June ............. 
 34 0 Total .......... 
. 
 504 15 And so, by dint of frantic effort, the group of liquida-tionist intellectuals succeeded in enlisting the support of 15 groups of workers in all ! Could one imagine a more shattering defeat of the liqui-dators since January 1912? Could one imagine a more specif-ic proof of the fact that we are in the presence of a group ofliquidationist intellectuals who are capable of publishing asemi-liberal magazine and newspaper, but totally lack any serious support among the proletarian masses? Here, in addition, are data on the territorial distribution of the donations sent to the liquidators by groups of work-ers: Number of group contributions by workers for a workers ’ daily newspaper during the first half of 1912 Non-liqui-Liquida-dationist tionist newspapers newspapers St. 
 Petersburg and vicinity .... 
 415 10 South ............. 
 51 1 Moscow and its area ....... 
 13 2 North and West ....... 
. 
 121 Urals and Volga region .... 
. 
 60 Caucasus, Siberia and Finland . 
. 
 71 Total .......... 
. 
 504 15 * And so, the liquidators’ defeat in the South during the six-month period is even worse than in St. 
 Petersburg. 
 These exact workers’ statistics, which were published openly for as long as six months in newspapers of opposedtrends, definitely settle the question of “liquidationism”. 
One may revile the opponents of liquidationism and slanderthem as much as one pleases, but these exact data on group contributions by workers are irrefutable. 
 It is quite understandable now why neither Nevskaya Zvezda nor Pravda took the liquidators’ threat of “duplicate candidates” seriously It would be ridiculous to take seri-ously threats from people who in six months of open strugglerevealed that they amount to little more than zero. 
 All the defenders of liquidationism have united in Zhivoye Dyelo *Moscow, 2; Nakhichevan, Novonikolayevsk and Archangel, 1 each. 
 and Nevsky Golos . 
 And it took all of them together six months to win over fifteen groups of workers! Liquidationism amounts to nil in the working-class movement; it is only strong among the liberal intelligentsia. 
 IV The data in Pravda on all kinds of workers’ contributions are, generally speaking, extremely interesting. 
 They pro-vide us, for the first time, with highly accurate data on themost diverse aspects of the working-class movement and thelife of Russian worker democrats. 
 We hope to return to theanalysis of these data more than once. 
 At the moment, however, before we finish our survey of data on the contributions made by groups of workers for a daily newspaper, we must point out one practical conclu-sion. 
 Workers’ groups made 504 contributions to their press, to Zvezda and Pravda . 
 The workers had absolutely no other aim in view except the founding and maintenance of their workers’ press. 
 That is precisely why a simple truthful summary of these data for six months provides a most valu-able picture of the life of worker democrats in Russia. 
 Thefive-and ten-kopek pieces collected and marked “from agroup of workers of such-and-such a factory” have made itpossible also to appraise the workers’ sentiments, their class-consciousness, their unity, and their readiness to pro-mote the working-class cause. 
 That is why this custom of group collections by the work-ers, brought into being by the upswing in April and May,should by all means be continued, developed and expanded,and it goes without saying that accounts of the collections are necessary too, such as have always been published in Pravda . 
 This custom is of vast importance from the standpoint of both the stability of the working-class press and the com-mon interests of the worker democrats. 
 The working-class press needs to be developed and strength-ened. 
 And this requires money. 
 Workers’ newspapers in Russia can be satisfactorily organised through perse-vering effort only on condition that the workers constantly arrange massive collections. 
 There is a workers’ paper in America ( Appeal to Reason103) which has over half a million subscribers. 
 That Russian worker, we would say, paraphras-ing a well-known saying, is a poor worker indeed if he doesnot hope to overtake and surpass his American fellow-workers. 
 What is very much more important, however, is not the financial aspect of the matter, but something else. 
 Let us assume that a hundred workers in different shops of a factory contribute one kopek each on pay-day to the workers’ news-paper. 
 That will add up to two rubles a month. 
 Let usassume, on the other hand, that ten well-paid workersmeeting by chance collect ten rubles at once. 
 The former two rubles are worth more than the latter ten. 
 This is so obvious to any worker that it does not have to be explained at length. 
 It should be made a custom for every worker to contribute one kopek to the workers’ newspaper every pay-day. 
 Let subscriptions to the paper be taken as usual, and let thosewho can contribute more do so, as they have done in the past. 
 It is very important, besides, to establish and spread the custom of “ a kopek for the workers ’ newspaper ”. 
 The significance of such collections will depend above all on their being regularly held every pay-day, without in-terruption, and on an ever greater number of workers takingpart in these regular collections. 
 Accounts could be pub-lished in a simple form: “so-and-so many kopeks” would im-ply that so many workers at the given factory had contributedto the workers’ paper, and if there were any larger contri-butions, they could be stated as follows: “In addition, so-and-so many workers contributed so-and-so much. 
” If this custom of a kopek for the workers ’ newspaper becomes established, the workers of Russia will soon raise their pa-pers to the proper standard. 
 Workers’ papers should givemore information, and of a more varied nature; they shouldhave Sunday supplements and so on, and should have theircorrespondents in the Duma, in all Russia’s towns and in themajor cities abroad. 
 The workers’ newspaper should develop and improve steadily , which cannot be done unless the great-est possible number of workers regularly collect money fortheir press. 
 Monthly reports on the workers ’ kopek will show everyone how the workers throughout Russia are shaking of their indifference and drowsiness, how they are awakening to an intelligent and cultured life—not in the official nor inthe liberal sense of the term. 
 It will be possible to seeclearly how interest in the workers’ democratic movementis growing, and how the time is drawing near when Moscowand the other big cities will have workers’ papers of their own. 
 We have had enough of the domination of the bourgeois Kopeika ! 104 That unscrupulous, huckster-minded newspaper has reigned long enough. 
 In a matter of six months, the work-ers of St. 
 Petersburg have shown how tremendously suc-cessful joint collections by the workers can be. 
 May their example and their initiative not be in vain. 
 May the custom of a workers ’ kopek for the workers ’ newspaper develop and gain strength! Written on July 12-14 (25-27), 1912 Published in Pravda Nos.

 Unfortunately, such reports originatefrom particular groups of political exiles. 
 In most cases they come from people who are either absolutely unfamiliar with the actual state of affairs in Russia at the present timeor deliberately seek to mislead the German comrades bya one-sided presentation of party politics. 
 Every suchgroup of exiles has its own special “trend”, but in realityit consists of people who have lost all living contact with the fighting Russian workers’ Party or have never had such contact. 
 Unfortunately, one of this kind of “informants”succeeded in winning the confidence of Vorwärts . 
 The Central Organ of the German Social-Democratic Party in a seriesof articles opened its columns to a torrent of unheard-ofslander against the Russian Party, poured out from the pen of that informant and supposed to be derived from “ob-jective” sources. 
 Actually, those sources were “subjective” and false through and through. 
 Since Vorwärts did not insert our factual correction , we had to issue a separate pamphlet entitled The Anonymous Writer in Vorwärts and the State of Affairs in the R.

 sent to the Executive Committee of the German Social-Demo-cratic Party. 
 The Letts had suggested that the Executiveshould arrange a joint meeting of eleven “centres” onthe question of material support for the election cam-paign, whereupon the Executive asked those centres about their attitude to the matter. 
 The letter is the answer given by the Central Committee, and it reads as follows: July 30, 1912 * TO THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE GERMAN SOCIAL -DEMOCRATIC PARTY Dear Comrades, Recently we received a copy of the letter sent to you by the Committee of the Lettish Social-Democracy Abroad on June 24. 
 We saw no point in explaining the queer plan of these Letts to you, as we did not think any well-informedperson would take that plan seriously. 
 But we were sur-prised to learn from your letter to us of July 22 that youintend to adopt that plan. 
 This compels us to express ouremphatic protest, which we hereby send you. 
 Objectively, the intention of the Executive Committee is nothing short of an attempt to contribute to the split in our Party (theR.

) and to the formation of a new party hostile tous. 
 This is unprecedented in the history of the whole Inter-national.

 This Conference restored the Party and elected a new Central Committee in place of the one destroyed by the liquidators; furthermore, the Conference was com-pelled to declare these liquidators to be outside the Party. 
(See pamphlet The Anonymous Writer in Vorwärts and the State of Affairs in the R.

 , which was sent to the Executive Committee; it mentioned the protest of the liq-uidators and of the national organisations—the Poles, the Letts, the Bund and the groups abroad. 
) In January also a meeting took place with the aim of setting up an Organising Committee to convene a new confer-ence—a “general Party conference”, as the liquidators andtheir friends called it. 
 In their letter to the Executive Committee of June 24, the Letts affirmed that this “Organising Committee” in-volved the following organisations and trends: the Bund, theLettish Social-Democrats, the Caucasian Regional Commit-tee, the Menshevik Golos Sotsial-Demokrata , the Vienna Pravda and the Vperyod group. 
 And so, on one side there is the Central Committee of the R.

L. 
P. 
 elected at the Conference by Russian organi-sations, i. 
e. 
, organisations working in Russia (the oppo-nents call it the Leninist trend); on the other side thereis the so-called Organising Committee, which promises toconvene a “general” Party conference. 
 WHAT IS THE RELATION OF THE HITHERTO NEUTRAL RUSSIAN SOCIAL -DEMOCRATS TO THE SO-CALLED ORGANISING COMMITTEE? Plekhanov, the best known of the Mensheviks, who had been waging a determined fight against the destruction of the Party by the liquidators, did not attend the JanuaryParty Conference, although he was invited. 
 In April 1912he published his correspondence with the representative ofthe Organising Committee (see his Dnevnik Sotsial-Demo-krata No. 
 16). 
 Plekhanov refused to take part in the so-called Organis-ing Committee because, he said, the Bund was conveningnot a conference of the existing Party organisations, but an “inaugural ” conference , i. 
 e. 
 , one that was to found a new party . 
 The so-called initiating groups, which in reality are the only groups backing the Organising Committee, are, according to Plekhanov, liquidationist groups, whichdo not belong to the Party and want to form a new party. 
In April 1912 Plekhanov wrote: “The new conference isbeing called by the liquidators. 
” In July this Organising Committee published its Listok No. 
 3, which contains not a word, not a hint, of a reply to Plekhanov. 
 One can judge from this how the ExecutiveCommittee is kept informed by the Letts, those very sameLetts who complain that the “Leninist” Central Committeedoes not answer the letters of the Organising Committee. 
 Is it really so very strange that the Central Committee of the Party—of the old Party—should not reply to those who, according to the hitherto neutral Plekhanov, arefounding a new party? The Organising Committee must first of all prove to the neutral Plekhanov that it is not forming a new party andnot liquidating the old one. 
 The Letts who are taking part in the Organising Com-mittee and who appealed to the Executive Committee onJune 24 should—after six months’ struggle of this Organis-ing Committee of the liquidators against the Party—haveshown by facts and documents the results of this struggle;instead, they show the Executive Committee the Potem-kin villages106 of the liquidators . 
 The Letts proposed that the Executive should convene eleven “organisational” centres, organisations and factionsof the Russian Social-Democrats. 
 That is literally what theystated (see p. 
 4 of the Letts’ letter to the Executive of June24). 
 All over the world, parties have so far been formed of local organisations united by a single central body. 
 Butin 1912 the Russian and Lettish liquidators made a greatdiscovery. 
 From now on, a party may be formed of “cen-tres, organisations and factions”. 
 According to the Letts’ latest liquidationist electoral geometry, the eleven organisational centres, organisations and factions include, firstly, the Organising Committee and,secondly, six factions, or organisations, or centres, which form that Organising Committee . 
 The Letts’ letter says in so many words: “Points 2 to 7 inclusive form the Organis-ing Committee. 
” Thus the intellectualist groups that are liquidating the Party obtain a treble vote, like the aristocracy in the “rotten boroughs”: (1) The Caucasian Regional Committee, a fictitious or-ganisation; (2) Ditto, as represented by the Paris Golos , although Golos has no permanent mandate from the Caucasus; (3) Ditto, as represented by the Organising Committee. 
 We maintain that the Russian workers will indignantly and contemptuously reject the idea of discussing the ques-tion of duplicate candidates, i. 
e. 
, the attempt of the liquida-tors jointly with the insignificant groups abroad to cause a split, the more so since these groups represent only in-tellectualist disorganisers. 
 We wish to point out the fact that not a single one of the groups abroad that are fighting against the Party has duringthe past six months received a mandate from any organisa-tion in Russia to publish its newspaper or issue leaflets. 
 If the Letts are trying to prove the contrary to the ExecutiveCommittee, let them name in the Russian press at leastone such mandate prior to July 22. 
 Golos Sotsial-Demokrata is not the organ of any Rus-sian organisation. 
 Nor is Trotsky’s Vienna Pravda the organ of any Russian organisation. 
 Three years ago Pravda was the organ of the Ukrainian Spilka107 (Southern Russia), but the Spilka can-celled its mandate long ago. 
 Neither Vperyod , nor Plekhanov, nor the “pro-Party Bolsheviks”, publish any organs that are Party organs of any organisation in Russia. 
 It is very easy to refer to groups which do not exist in reality. 
 Nor is it difficult to print reports expressing “sym-pathy”. 
 But to bring out, even for six months, the organ ofan organisation operating in Russia, it is necessary to haveregular contacts, the unqualified confidence of the mass of the workers in the localities, and unity of views on tactics, which can be achieved only through joint work over along period. 
 The tiny groups abroad which the Lettish and Bundist disorganisers are mobilising against the Party lack all this. 
 As regards the Polish Socialist Party, we shall say briefly: it is no Social-Democratic organisation. 
 It has never been part of the Social-Democratic Labour Party. 
 There is onlyone reason for inviting it, namely, it “promises” to becomeSocial-Democratic and join the liquidators! For the disor-ganisers and lovers of splits, this, of course, is sufficient! If the Polish Socialist Party is to be invited to take part in meetings, why not also invite the Socialist-Revolutiona-ries, who take part in the Duma elections, the Zionist-So-cialists, the Lettish Union of Socialist-Revolutionaries,and other similar “trends”? THE SOCIAL -DEMOCRATIC GROUP IN THE THIRD DUMA Among the organisational centres the Executive Commit-tee has included the little groups abroad; on the other hand,it has not invited the Social-Democratic group in the Duma . 
 This is incredible, yet it is a fact. 
 It will be useful for the Russian workers to know how Trotsky and Co. 
 are mislead-ing our foreign comrades. 
 In their letter to the Executive Committee of June 24, the Letts wrote: “As regards the Social-Democratic Duma group, there can be no question of its good offices in the matter of financial assistance to theelection campaign, for the Duma session is drawing to a close andsimultaneously the Duma group is thereby dissolving itself” (p. 
 2of the repeatedly quoted letter). 
 This is either deliberate deception, or boundless political ignorance, indicating clearly enough how far the Letts in Brussels are informed about the elections in Russia. 
 The letter is dated June 24. 
 On June 9, i. 
e. 
, June 22, new style, the Third Duma was officially dissolved for an indefinite period, all the deputies, the Social-Democrats among them, retaining their mandates. 
 The latter are there-fore still Duma deputies , which is known to every literate worker in Russia. 
 But this is unknown to the slanderers of the Party abroad. 
 The only legally existing Social-Democrats in Russia, who are the only official organisation in whatever part of the country they may be, are precisely the members of the Social-Democratic group in the Third Duma. 
 All the liquidators hate the group. 
 The sheets of the liquidators ( Nasha Zarya ) heap abuse and insinuations upon it, and all the disorganisers abroad spread tittle-tattle aboutit. 
 Why? Because the majority of the group, in which pro-Party Mensheviks have always predominated, have always fought with determination against the liquidators andhelped to make them quite harmless in St. 
 Petersburg. 
 In the pamphlet The Anonymous Writer , etc. 
, we pub-lished an important fact. 
 No one could say a word to refuteit. 
 Only two members of the group regularly contribute to the liquidationist papers. 
 Eight members of the group regularly contribute to the anti-liquidationist papers. 
 * Both the Letts and Trotsky propose that the Executive Committee should exclude from the meeting this body,the only all-Russia body to have preserved unity! Evenif the Letts were mistaken and on June 24 did not know what was known to all the workers in Russia, why did they not take the trouble prior to July 22, i. 
e. 
, in the course of awhole month, to correct their mistake? Some mistakes arevery useful to those who make them. 
 The intention of the Letts and the liquidators who have misled the Executive Committee is to impose liquida-tionist candidates on us, against the majority of the Party in Russia, of the Social-Democratic group in the Duma, bymeans of a bloc of fictitious little groups abroad and to ob-tain money by fraud from the German workers. 
 Such is thegist of the long speeches (of the Letts, Bundists, Trotskyand Co. 
). 
 But this deception will not go unpunished. 
 OFFICIALLY VERIFIABLE DATA ON THE INFLUENCE OF THE LIQUIDATORS COMPARED WITH THAT OF THE PARTY Every sensible person knows that the empty phrases about what is alleged to be secret “organisations” sympathisingwith the liquidators are not to be trusted at all. 
 *See present edition, Vol. 
 17, p.

— Ed. 
 We maintain that all the liquidationist organisations in Russia are fictitious. 
 It is difficult for those who lack accurate information on the state of affairs in Russian Social-Democratic circles toestablish the truth. 
 But even they can ascertain it if theysearch the written records and examine their meaning,refusing to take anything on trust. 
 We have already giventhe first commonly known and verifiable fact, namely, the division of the forces in the Social-Democratic Duma group between the liquidators and anti-liquidators. 
 But now, after six months’ struggle between the liquida-tors and the Party, there are further entirely objective, andstill more convincing, facts. 
 In the letter of June 24 (pp. 
 5 and 6), the Letts mentioned the legal Marxist papers in St. 
 Petersburg. 
 They named Zhivoye Dyelo and Nevsky Golos , which advocate a Men-shevik trend (that of Golos Sotsial-Demokrata ), and con-trasted them with Zvezda and the St. 
 Petersburg Pravda (not to be confused with Trotsky’s liquidationist ViennaPravda ), which, according to the Letts, “ are owned and led by Lenin ’s group ” alone. 
 Even though this assertion is unfortunate, the Letts have in spite of themselves cited a valid fact against the liqui-dators. 
 While the term “open party” is no more than an empty, liberal phrase of the liquidators, open activity in the Duma and in the press is the principal activity of Marxist propa-ganda. 
 It is here, and only here, that facts are to be foundwhich objectively show the relative strength of the liqui-dators and the anti-liquidators. 
 There are no other all-Russia political organs except those named by the Letts. 
 The liquidators have Zhivoye Dyelo and Nevsky Golos ; the anti-liquidators, Zvezda , subsequently named Nevskaya Zvezda , and Pravda (St. 
 Petersburg). 
 There are no other trends or factions in Russia,either in the press or in the public mass arena; all thegroups abroad named by the Letts are mere ciphers. 
 We now have the results of the six months’ activities of both trends. 
 During these six months (January-June 1912) all the Russian parties began, and completed, their preparations for the elections. 
 Only six or eight weeks now remain till the elections. 
 Most of the electoral lists have been drawn up. 
 The outcome of the elections is virtually predetermined by these six months’ preparations. 
 “Points” 1-7 in the Letts’ list declared for the liquidators (the Organising Committee, the Bund, the Lettish Social-Democracy, Golos , the Vienna Pravda , the Caucasian Re-gional Committee, Vperyod ). 
 The anti-liquidators were sup-ported by the Central Committee, which unites the Russian organisations, i. 
e. 
, those functioning in Russia (only the“Leninist trend”, as the liquidators assert). 
 Now let us see what each of the two has done. 
From January 1 to June 30 (old style), 1912, the liqui-dators published in St. 
 Petersburg sixteen issues of Zhivoye Dyelo and five issues of Nevsky Golos , or twenty-one issues in all. 
 During the same six months, the anti-liquidators pub-lished thirty-three issues of Zvezda , fourteen issues of Nev-skaya Zvezda and fifty-three issues of Pravda , or one hundred issues in all. 
 Twenty-one to one hundred. 
 Such is the balance of forces between the liquidators and the Party in Russia. 
 The data on the newspapers are opendata; anyone can check and substantiate them. 
 How do matters stand with the circulation of the papers? The Letts affirm that the liquidators have distributed 30,000 copies. 
 Let us assume that this is not an overstatement. 
 With regard to the anti-liquidationist papers, a person whomComrade Haase and other members have seen gave the Exec-utive Committee the figure of 60,000 copies. 
 This ratioreduces the influence of the liquidators, as compared withthat of the Party, to 1 : 10. 
 While information on circulation has not been published and may therefore seem exaggerated, other data havebeen published that are more important, and more con-vincing. 
 They are the information concerning the connection of the liquidators and of the Party with the mass of the work-ers in Russia. 
 OPEN AND VERIFIABLE DATA ON THE LINKS OF THE LIQUIDATORS AND THE PARTY WITH THE MASS OF THE WORKERS IN RUSSIA The data on the number of newspaper issues and copies published do not fully prove the superiority of the Partyover the liquidators. 
 Even small groups of liberal intel-lectuals can publish newspapers. 
 Any newspaper which is“friendly to the workers”, or even a liberal newspaper of a radical shade, will always find many readers in Russia. 
 It will be read not only by workers, but by liberals and alsoby petty-bourgeois democrats. 
 There are facts, however, which reveal much more simply and clearly the links of the liquidators and the Party with the mass of the workers in Russia. 
 They are the data on the funds collected for a workers’ press. 
 For a long time agitation has been carried on among the workers in Russia for the collection of funds to publish a workers’ daily newspaper. 
 Everyone realised that without such a newspaper, participation in the elections would almost be a fiction. 
 A newspaper is the chief weapon in an election campaign, the chief means of Marxist agitation among the masses. 
 But where is the money for a newspaper to come from? It is necessary to organise collections among the workers. 
 These collections form a fund and show the strength of the links of this or that group. 
 They are an indication of the prestige of the groups, the confidence placed in them by the workers, and their actual influence on the proletarian masses. 
 Such collections for a workers’ newspaper were begun in St. 
 Petersburg early in 1912. 
 Six months—from January 1 to June 30—is a long enough period. 
 Data on the collections are published in all the newspapers listed above, the liqui-dationist as well as the anti-liquidationist ones. 
 The conclusions which may be drawn from these data for six months are best evidence, an open, complete, objec-tive and final answer to the question concerning the balance of the forces of the liquidators and the Party in Russia. 
 Therefore we have given in the appendix a full translation of all the accounts of money collections for a daily workers’ newspaper, taken from all the five above-mentioned news-papers for six months. 
 Here we give only the totals. 
 During the six months, the anti-liquidationist newspa-pers published accounts of 504 money collections amonggroups of workers, i. 
e. 
, those giving the name of the workers’groups which made the collections. 
 These collections weremade in fifty Russian towns and factory settlements. 
 During the same six months—from January 1 to June 30, 1912—the liquidationist newspapers published accounts offifteen money collections among groups of workers. 
 Thesecollections were made in five Russian towns. 
 * Here are the precise accounts: Money collections by groups of workers for a workers ’ daily newspaper January 1 to June 30, 1912 In anti-In liquida-liquida-tionist tionist newspapers newspapers January ............ 01 4 February ............ 01 8 March .............

 17 15 504 *In spite of the gossip spread by the liquidators, it was these collections, which exceeded 12,000 marks, and the aid rendered ear-lier by the German comrades, that formed the basic fund of our Social-Democratic press in Russia. 
 The full translation, mentioned in the text, of all the accounts of money collections published by the various Social-Democratic newspapers over the six months was sent to theExecutive Committee, the Auditing Committee and Bebel. 
 After six months’ struggle against the Party, the liquida-tors were completely routed. 
 The liquidators do not count at all in the Russian Social-Democratic labour movement. 
 This is proved by the above-quoted data, which anyone can verify. 
 Such are the factspublished in Russia for a whole half-year, despite the brag-ging of Trotsky and the liquidators. 
 It should be noted that Trotsky is a contributor to Zhivoye Dyelo . 
 Furthermore, the Letts themselves, in their letter of June 24, admit that all the six groups, including Trotsky,the Menshevik Golos , and the leaders of Zhivoye Dyelo and Nevsky Golos , form the so-called Organising Committee. 
 Therefore, our data prove that not only the liquidators,but all their pretentious friends abroad are of no account in the Social-Democratic labour movement in Russia. 
 On the average, only one group of workers in Russia out of thirty sides with them. 
 We give here the addresses and the dates of publication of all the Social-Democratic papers in St. 
 Petersburg.

 CONCLUSION The candidates of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 in the forthcoming Duma elections will be nominated by the local Party organ-isations without distinction of views and trends. 
 The minor-ity of the worker Social-Democrats will everywhere have to submit to the majority. 
 The notorious duplication of candidates is simply non-sense, serving merely to frighten the foreign comrades andextort money. 
 All that is wanting is for the notorious ten “trends” to raise the bogey of ten candidates and for money to be begged from foreigners for each of them. 
 There will be no duplicate candidates. 
 The liquidators are so weak that they cannot put up duplicate candidates. 
We do not negotiate with a handful of liquidators whohave betrayed the Party. 
 Neither the Central Commit-tee in Russia nor the local organisations take the liquida-tors seriously. 
 Note, for example, the latest events in St. 
Petersburg. 
 The liquidators reported in Nevsky Golos (No. 
 6) that meetings were held with them (the liquidators) inSt. 
 Petersburg in connection with carrying out the electioncampaign. 
 Both Nevskaya Zvezda (No. 
 16) and Pravda ( No . 
 61) of July 21 and 23 reported that they had not sent repre-sentatives to the meetings; moreover, one participant inthe meetings announced in Nevskaya Zvezda that the work-ers all over Russia would carry out the decisions of theJanuary Conference of the R.

 “Union of the various trends,” he said, referring to the liquida-tors, “is quite inconceivable in the Social-Democratic election cam-paign. 
” ( Nevskaya Zvezda No. 
 16, July 8 [21], 1912. 
) No financial assistance in the world can win the sympa-thies of the Russian workers for the liquidators. 
 But, ofcourse, it is possible to put up fictitious duplicate candidates in various places with the money of the Executive Commit-tee. 
 In that case the responsibility for such candidates,who will virtually be candidates of the German Executive Committee, will also fall on the Executive Committee. 
 The money handed out to the liquidators, who have no daily newspaper , will help them to found a competing organ. 
 That money will be used to bring about a split by those who duringlong years of struggle have proved their insignificance ; the money will be used for trips , etc. 
 , with the aim of founding a new party . 
 If the Executive Committee now wants to help the liqui-dators in one way or another, then, much as we respect the fraternal German Party, we shall have to appeal to theInternational. 
 Then we shall prove to the Vienna International Congress 108 by documents that the Executive Committee has expressed its readiness by means of financial support tohelp in bringing about a split in our Party, putting up duplicate candidates and galvanising that corpse—the de-feated liquidators. 
 If the German comrades want to help theR.

 After the Executive Committee had called off the proposed meeting, it informed us that it “cannot give money to anyof the Party groups in Russia for the election campaignuntil all of them jointly indicate to us [the Executive Com-mittee] a body enjoying universal confidence and author-ised to receive and distribute funds”. 
 This pretended neutrality of the Executive Committee amounts in reality to a refusal to support the workers’Party in Russia because of the calumny heaped upon it bythe little groups abroad and by the “conference” of theliquidators. 
 Besides the comments made above, we regard it as our duty to add the following. 
 The Russian newspapers legally existing and published in a Marxist spirit are at the present time the most im-portant legal mouthpiece of the mass of the Russian Social-Democratic workers in connection with the Party’s agita-tion work. 
 The newspapers appearing abroad, which are illegal in Russia, cannot really claim to be as important as those mentioned above, although their fundamental importance for theoretically elucidating the movement is undoubtedly very great. 
 For everyone knows how easily, and sometimes frivolously, such papers are founded by small groups ofRussian exiles scattered abroad. 
 Those newspapers havea precarious existence among the groups concerned, andhardly ever reach the Russian members of the Party. 
 Thatis why they cannot really be said to exert any appreciable influence on Party life in Russia. 
 After six months’ struggle of the anti-liquidationist newspapers (from January to June 1912) there is only one liquidationist paper— Nevsky Golos . 
 This paper has almost ceased to exist as a political organ. 
 During a month and ahalf (from June to mid-August), only two issues appeared (Nos. 
 6 and 7). 
 Obviously, no such newspaper can withstand the police persecution that is raging in Russia against all workers’ newspapers, and even against many quite moderateliberal ones, unless it draws its vital energy from closecontact with the mass of the workers. 
 The weekly Nevskaya Zvezda and the daily Pravda are now workers’ newspapers of this kind; they carry great political weight and are of immediate and topical importance. 
 Bothappear in St. 
 Petersburg; our political opponents among the Lettish Social-Democrats have contemptuously dismissedthem as organs of “Lenin’s group”. 
 From the objective data cited above, which can be openly verified at any time, it should become obvious to our German comrades that this “Lenin’s group” comprises, in fact, the overwhelm-ing majority of the Russian worker Social-Democrats. 
 Hence it is quite understandable why the information coming from the liquidators and groups, or tiny groups,sympathising with them, is not to be trusted in the least . 
 All the rumours spread by those little groups together with the Jewish (Bund) and Lettish Social-Democrats, who haveno direct contact with the Russian movement, about the joint conference of all “trends” 109 that has been convened, or allegedly is about to be convened, turn out to be pureinventions. 
 No such conference, even if it were to take place, could play any serious part in the struggle of the Russian proletariat. 
 Basically, therefore, it is, if we re-luctantly are to use a harsh word, a question of a swindle. 
 To make the relevant facts, which are undoubtedly of great political importance, still clearer to our German Party comrades, we shall quote in conclusion some extracts from an article by Axelrod, one of the liquidationist leaders,which appeared in the last issue of the monthly Nasha Zarya . 
 Axelrod wrote: “The idea of a ‘non-factional’ Social-Democratic ... organ is utopian at present and, moreover, a utopia that ... runs counter tothe interests of the Party’s political development .... 
 We may be said to have no factions that have taken shape organisationally. 
Instead, we have various circles and small groups, of which some hold more or less definite political, tactical and organisational views, while the others waver in various directions, getting in the way ofthe former .... 
 The focal point and main source of internal Party dis-cord is, on the one hand, the difference in the attitude of the variousParty circles to the now, open Social-Democratic and labour move-ment and, on the other hand, substantial differences over the imme-diate political tasks and the political tactics of the Russian Social-Democratic movement. 
 The questions of both those categories ...are becoming particularly burning and topical issues just now .... 
 And it is over them that the Russian Social-Democrats have splitinto two main camps .... 
 The question arises whether the projected labour newspaper [proposed by some workers in St. 
 Petersburg and by many intellectuals abroad] will be able to take a neutral position between those two opposed camps, and whether such a position ispermissible on principle. 
 Obviously not .... 
 Such being the situation in the Party, to talk about ‘non-factionalism’ as a panacea means... deceiving oneself and others as to the real state of affairs in theSocial-Democratic movement .... 
 Factional organisation and consol-idation are a direct duty and urgent task of the advocates of a Party reform, or rather revolution” (in the Party). 
 Axelrod’s last words obviously refer to the liquidators. 
 We can only advise our German Party comrades, if they hear from various quarters about “non-factionalism”, or about anon-factional conference with the liquidators participating,to demand, for better orientation, a full translation of Axel-rod’s above-quoted article for the German Social-Democra-tic press. 
 Then they will see certain fables for what they are, and will be able to judge them.

 Today, September 15, 1912, we have received via Paris the following letter from the Executive Committee, a letter which should make it particularly clear to the German com-rades how right we were in protesting against the irrespon-sible private “informants” of the Executive who are afraidto act openly. 
 On the 10th inst. 
, the Party Executive wrote: Berlin, September 10, 1912 Dear Comrade Kuznetsov, Will you bo so kind as to inform us whether it is true that the constituencies in which all the Social-Democratic groups reachedagreement during the elections to the State Duma include the follo-wing: Yekaterinoslav, Kharkov the city of Moscow and Moscow Guber-nia, the Don region and Odessa. 
 Kindly send your information as early as possible to H. 
 Müller, Chemnitz . 
 If we have no news from you by September 17, we shall consider the above statement to be true. 
 With Party greetings, H. 
 Müller We answered the letter as follows: Executive Committee of the Social-Democratic Party of Germany. 
 Dear Comrades, it goes without saying that all that has been re-ported to the Executive Committee is based on an untruth and is an invention pure and simple of the liquidators. 
 We can affirm with confidence that that fable could have been told to the Executiveonly by the Letts, the Bundists, or even by Trotsky’s adherents,who only a short time ago closed “their” conference, which theywould have liked to call a “party conference”, but which was infact a liquidationist conference. 
 In order not to state anything that could not be confirmed and not to quote our organisational corre-spondence, we shall limit ourselves here to pointing to a documentpublished in St. 
 Petersburg. 
 On August 28 (September 10, new style), 1912, the St. 
 Peters-burg Marxist daily, Pravda No. 
 102, carried a letter received from one of Kharkov’s biggest factories and devoted especially to the Duma elections. 
 The letter said openly and plainly that “the names of the liquidators’ candidates have so far not been announced ” and that the liquidators “ deny the necessity for a workers ’ party ” (Pravda No. 
 102, p. 
 4, col. 
 1). 
 From this alone the German comrades can see how shame-lessly the Letts, the Bundists, Trotsky’s adherents and all such private informants are deceiving them. 
 The point is, evidently, that all of them, probably including the Cau-casians, wanted to obtain money on behalf of pretended“organisations”, whose existence cannot be confirmed orverified either by the Party Executive or by anyone else. 
 Is it possible that the German Party, which has ninety Social-Democratic dailies, cannot—that is, if it does not want to compromise itself by misinterpreting the state ofaffairs in the Russian Party—open a discussion on theR. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
, and openly compel all the informants who arehiding from the light of day to present statements over theirsignatures and produce documents? After all, Russia is not as far away as Central Africa, and it would not take much effort on the part of the Germanworker Social-Democrats to establish the truth and therebyalso relieve the German members of the Executive Com-mittee of the need to hear unverifiable private stories.

110 After the above lines had gone to press, we received Nev-sky Golos No. 
 7, published in St. 
 Petersburg on August 17, old style. 
 Consequently, the liquidationist newspaper has resumed publication after an interruption of one and a half months . 
 (The previous issue of this weekly—No. 
 6— appeared on July 5, old style. 
) The information published in Nevsky Golos No. 
 7 pro-vides the best confirmation of the appraisal of the actual significance of the liquidators in Russia which was givenin our Central Committee’s letter to the Vorstand . 
 * Indeed, early in July the paper suspended publication. 
 Needless to say, the liquidators and their friends bent alltheir efforts to revive it. 
 The results of their efforts during one and a half months (July and half August) are reported by Nevsky Golos itself (No. 
 7) as follows: “This newspaper has received, for the replenishment of its funds : July .

11 rubles Everyone knows, as Plekhanov stated in print ( Dnevnik Sotsial-Demokrata No. 
 16) as far back as April 1912, that the “ initiating groups ” are groups of liquidators . 
 And so, the liquidators were helped, at the most trying moment, when their paper had suspended publication, by: one group of liquidators in Russia one group of friends in Paris 35 well-to-do persons, each of whom contributed an average of 20 rubles (over 40 marks each) 15 private individuals, each of whom contributed an average of 5 rubles (over 10 marks each). 
 Was not our Central Committee justified in asserting that the liquidators in the Russian working-class movement were of no account at all? The liquidators refer to the “Caucasian Regional Commit-tee”. 
 Not a single workers ’ group in the Caucasus has sent them a single contribution during those one and a half months. 
 The liquidators would like to have the help of the Bund and the Lettish Social-Democratic organisation. 
 Not a single workers’ group, either in the Bund or among the Letts, has sent them a single contribution during one and a halfmonths. 
 During the same period (July to August 14) Pravda , the St. 
 Petersburg daily newspaper of the anti-liquidators, published accounts of 41 group collections by workers i n various parts of Russia, including oil-field workers (Groznyfields, Terek Region) ( Pravda No. 
 60) and Jewish workers in Lepaya ( Pravda No. 
 67). 
 We venture to think that this aid from workers means more than all the talk and declama-tion of the “Caucasian Regional Committee”, the Letts and the Bund. 
 No aid in the world, and no “conferences” with the Letts, the Bund, etc. 
, can transform the liquidationist nothing in the Russian working-class movement into a something.

 CAPITALISM AND POPULAR CONSUMPTION Recently the French magazine La Revue scientifique111 published data on the production of margarine in various countries. 
 Those data were an additional reminder of the fact noticed long ago that the diet of the people deterio-rates as capitalism develops. 
 As everyone knows, margarine is fat (from which stearine has been removed) processed by a special method. 
 Fromit an artificial substance is made, known as margarine butter. 
 Margarine production in the principal European countries has assumed very large proportions. 
 Germany produces12. 
5 million poods of it per year, Britain, 7. 
5 million poods,and so on. 
 Margarine is cheaper than real butter. 
 Butter is too costly for the vast majority of the population in the capitalist countries. 
 The workers earn so little that they have to buycheap, low-grade, substitute food products. 
 And yet theworkers are the chief consumers. 
 There are millions of work-ers, and only hundreds of capitalists. 
 And so the output ofcheap substitutes is growing daily and hourly, along with the unheard-of luxury of a handful of millionaires. 
 The wealth of the bourgeoisie is growing. 
 So are the poverty and want of the proletariat and of the mass of smallproprietors, peasants, artisans and petty traders, who arebeing ruined. 
 Remarkably enough, margarine consumption is highest in the very countries which are particularly famous as pro-ducers of large quantities of the finest natural butter. 
 Tofind out how great the consumption of margarine is, it is necessary to divide the whole amount of margarine pro-duced in the country concerned (adding import and sub-tracting export) by the number of inhabitants. 
 It appears that the greatest consumer of margarine is Denmark—16,4 kilograms (about one pood) a year per in-habitant. 
 Next comes Norway—15 pounds, Germany—7. 
5pounds, etc. 
 Denmark is the richest country for butter output. 
 Danish butter—real butter—ranks among the finest grades. 
 The world’s biggest and richest city, London (population, in-cluding that of the suburbs, about six million), prefersDanish butter to any other, and pays the highest pricefor it. 
 Danish well-to-do peasants, but above all the Danish capitalists, make a good deal of money from the butter trade. 
 And yet Denmark is the world’s biggest consumerof substitute butter, margarine! What is the explanation?It is very simple. 
 The vast majority of the Danish popu-lation, like that of any other capitalist country, consists of workers and propertyless peasants. 
 They cannot afford real butter. 
 Even the middle peasants in Denmark, beingin need of money, sell abroad the butter they produce ontheir farms and buy the cheap margarine for themselves. 
The wealth of the Danish capitalists is growing, and so arethe poverty and want of the Danish workers and peasants. 
 The same thing is happening here in Russia. 
 Very long ago, some forty years back, when it became fashionable toset up cheese dairies and artels in the countryside, Engel-hardt, a democratic writer, noted that the peasants, beingin need of money, sold their milk and butter while theirchildren starved to death. 
 That fact has been noted many times since then. 
 Cheese production is growing, the production of milk for sale isgrowing, and the few well-to-do peasants and the mer-chants are becoming rich, while the poor become poorer still. 
The children of poor peasants, left without milk, die in enor-mous numbers. 
 Child mortality in Russia is incredibly high. 
 Fairly often milk is sold to cheese dairies, from which the peasants then get skimmed milk for their own con-sumption. 
 The rich have the profits from growing production and trade, while the workers and peasants have margarine and skimmed milk. 
 Such is capitalist reality, which liberal and official scholars are at such pains to embellish. 
 Pravda No.

 B. 
 to the Pravda text LIBERALS AND CLERICALS The priesthood is about to flood the Fourth Duma. 
 How are we to react to this emergence of the priests on the political scene? Democrats can never hold the view that priests should not participate in political affairs. 
 It is an arch-reactionaryview. 
 It leads only to official hypocrisy and nothing more. 
In practice, all measures debarring a particular group orsection of the population from politics and the class struggleare absolutely impossible and unrealisable. 
 Let us recall that Bebel and the German Social-Demo-crats were for freedom of Jesuit agitation in Germany Weare against liberal phrases about “prohibiting” Jesuit agita-tion, said the Social-Democrats. 
 We are not afraid of theJesuits. 
 Let the Jesuits enjoy complete freedom of agitation, but let the authorities guarantee that we Social-Democrats, too, shall enjoy complete freedom of agitation. 
 That is how Bebel and the German Social-Democrats reasoned. 
 The worker democrats in Russia are fighting against the falsification of suffrage (and all other rights) in favourof the landlords or the priesthood, etc. 
, and not at all againstfreedom of the priesthood to participate in political affairs. 
 We stand for the class struggle, and we demand complete freedom for any class or social-estate, for either sex for anypeople, any section or group of the population, to take partin politics. 
 The liberals’ reasoning on this question is wrong and un-democratic. 
 Prince Trubetskoi, for example, wrote not so long ago, to the applause of Rech : “The transformation of the Church into a political instru-ment is achieved at the price of its internal destruction” He described the plan of flooding the Duma with priests as “contrary to Christianity and the Church”. 
 That is not true. 
 It is hypocrisy. 
 It is a thoroughly re-actionary point of view. 
 Trubetskoi and other liberals take an undemocratic stand in their struggle against clericalism. 
 Under the guiseof opposing participation of the priesthood in the politicalstruggle, they advocate its more covert (and hence much more harmful) participation. 
 Worker democrats favour freedom of political struggle for all, including the priests. 
 We are opposed, not to thepriests taking part in the election campaign, in the Dumaetc. 
, but solely to the medieval privileges of the priesthood. 
 We are not afraid of clericalism, and will readily join issue with it—on a free platform on which all will be on an equal footing. 
 The priesthood has always participated in politicscovertly ; the people stand to gain, and to gain a good deal, if the priesthood begins to participate in politics overtly . 
 Pravda No. 
 74, July 25, 1912 Published according Signed: A Layman to the Pravda text CADETS AND DEMOCRATS “We are accustomed to think,” says the leading article in Rech , “that Marxists admit the Cadets to be a democratic party, although they affix the offensive label of ‘bourgeois’” (i. 
e. 
, bourgeois-democratic). 
 It would be hard to imagine crasser political ignorance on the part of “educated people” who read Marxist litera-ture. 
 The question inevitably arises: does not calculationsometimes make people simulate ignorance? Since 1906 we have explained hundreds and thousands of times that the Cadets are not democrats but a liberal-mon-archist bourgeoisie. 
 In the spring of 1907 formal decisionsadopted by Marxists from all parts of Russia and familiarto every politically-educated person confirmed this andstated for all to hear that the Cadets were a party of theliberal-monarchist bourgeoisie, that their democracy was “hypocrisy”, and that the Cadets were followed by a section of the petty bourgeoisie “only by force of tradition [a blindhabit of clinging to the customary, to the old] and becauseit was simply deceived by the liberals ”. 
 112 These ideas have since been reaffirmed and elaborated hundreds and thousands of times. 
 But the Cadets assert, as if nothing had happened, that they are “in the habit of thinking” that Marxists considerthem democrats! There is none so deaf as he who will nothear. 
 The liberals differ from the conservatives (Black Hun-dreds) in that they represent the interests of the bourgeoi-sie, which needs progress and a fairly well organised legal system, the observance of legality, of the constitution, anda guarantee of some degree of political liberty. 
 But this progressive bourgeoisie dreads the democracy and the movement of the masses even more than it dreads reac-tion. 
 Hence the liberals’ perpetual tendency to make con-cessions to the old, to compromise with it, to defend manyfundamental mainstays of the old order. 
 And all this makesfor the complete impotence of liberalism, for its timidityhalf-heartedness and eternal vacillations. 
 Democrats represent the broad mass of the population. 
 A democrat is not afraid of the movement of the masses but believes in it. 
 In Russia the democrats are represented bythe Trudoviks and Left “Narodniks” in general. 
 The Marx-ists call them bourgeois democrats, not at all because they want to “offend” them, but because no redivision of theland and no democratic changes in the state are sufficient to remove the rule of capital, of the bourgeois system. 
 The policy of the worker democrats is clear. 
 We recognise agreements with the liberals against the Rights only at thesecond stage of the elections, and only where it is impossibletogether with the democrats to defeat the liberals. 
 Wefight side by side with all bourgeois democrats as long as they are true to their democratic principles. 
 Pravda No. 
 75, July 26, 1912 Published according to the Pravda text THE LIBERAL CAMPAIGN The liberals have begun to get busy and have brought concerted pressure to bear on Pravda . 
 Leading articles in the Cadet Rech , and the non-partisan progressive Mr. 
 Proko-povich and Mr. 
 R. 
 Blank in Zaprosy Zhizni opened fire on the workers’ newspaper for its decision to conduct an inde-pendent election campaign in St. 
 Petersburg. 
 “The efforts of Nevskaya Zvezda a n d Pravda are completely use-less,” asserts Zaprosy Zhizni . 
 “Surely they cannot seriously expect the candidate of the workers’ party to win in the St. 
 Petersburg citycuria, where the workers’ participation is negligible. 
” There you have a sample of the liberal arguments, and a method of intimidating the voter who has not yet risenabove philistinism, has not worked out an entirely consciouspolicy for himself. 
 There was a time when the liberals tried to intimidate simply with the prospect of a Black-Hundred victory in the elections. 
 But crude lies no longer “work”. 
 Everyone knowsthat there is not the slightest danger of the Black Hundredswinning in the St. 
 Petersburg elections. 
 So a different kindof intimidation is resorted to: “there is no reason to expectthe workers to win”. 
 Oh, no, liberal gentlemen, the democratic voter in gen-eral, and the worker in particular, has lived through manythings, he has thought over and learned many things inthe past difficult five years. 
 That sort of intimidation willget you nowhere. 
 Nowhere in the world have the workers begun their elec-tion campaign in a big city without being opposed b y strong liberal parties. 
 Nowhere in the world have worker democrats succeeded without a stubborn fight in wresting from the liberals their influence on the mass of the lower-grade office workers, shop-assistants, handicraftsmen, petty traders, etc. 
 Whoever is against the St. 
 Petersburg workers beginning that fight here and now (or rather going on from where theyleft off in 1906, 1907 and 1909), assumes the name of dem-ocrat in vain, and remains in fact a slave of the liberals. 
 Thousands upon thousands of new democratic voters will now take part in the St. 
 Petersburg elections. 
 The St. 
 Petersburg workers’ great achievement in founding their own workers’ daily newspaper fully entitles us to ex-pect no lesser achievements in the election campaign. 
 Thousands of old voters are awakening to a new, more class-conscious political activity. 
 They are learning, with the help of their workers’ newspaper, to fight for a betterlife for themselves, developing the habit of joint politicalaction, and growing increasingly aware of the great nationalproblems which the worker democrats are solving. 
 The liberals in St. 
 Petersburg can be defeated. 
 And from the liberals’ uneasiness and quarrelsome sallies, from their shouting and their attempts at intimidation, democratic St. 
Petersburg will derive added confidence that it is on theright path to victory. 
 Pravda No. 
 77, July 28, 1912 Published according to the Pravda text REVOLTS IN THE ARMY AND NAVY Recently a few reports have slipped even into our legal press about revolutionary unrest in the armed forces. 
 Weshall mention three chief reports. 
 Black Sea Fleet. 
 On June 27 a naval court in Sevastopol tried behind closed doors Zelenin, an electrician of the bat-tleship Ioann Zlatoust . 
 Together with Karpishin and Silya-kov, he was charged with writing and circulating an appealfor an armed revolt. 
 Zelenin, Karpishin and Silyakov weresentenced to death and were shot on July 10. 
 On July 2 the same court tried the crew of the same bat-tleship. 
 It charged sixteen sailors with incitement to seize the battleship. 
 Ten of the sailors were sentenced to death and five to penal servitude for six years. 
 On July 4 officialtelegrams reported that the ten men condemned to deathhad appealed for pardon. 
 Baltic Fleet. 
 On July 16 the naval court in Kronstadt harbour is to try sixty-five sailors of the training ship Dvina , the cruiser Aurora and the battleship Slava . 
 On July 3 the Octobrist paper Golos Moskvy received a telephone report from St. 
 Petersburg saying that there was much talk in thecity about that sensational trial. 
 The sixty-five sailors aresaid to be charged with membership of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party and of “a secret association which had planned an open revolt and the assassination of superior officers”. 
 The case goes back, according to the same report,to the arrest of a Dvina sailor on January 22, 1912. 
 It is known, furthermore, that during May arrests were made among the sailors of the Baltic Fleet in Helsing-fors. 
 Lastly, on July 1, there was an attempt at revolt by engineering troops in the village of Troyitskoye, near Tash-kent. 
 The insurgents bayoneted Junior Captain Pokhvisnev. 
The telegram reporting the incident was not released forpublication . 
 Not until July 10 did a reprint appear in St. 
 Petersburg from Turkestanskiye Vedomosti , an official paper which admitted that there had been a battle with the in-surgents. 
 Riflemen and Cossacks had smashed the insur-gent engineers, alleged to have numbered in all 100 to 130men. 
 The revolt began in the evening and was over, accord-ing to the official report, by the morning. 
 Some 380 engi-neers were arrested, of whom “more than one-half [the gov-ernment paper asserts] undoubtedly [??] had no share ” i n the revolt. 
 The insurgents killed, besides Pokhvisnev, twosecond lieutenants—Krasovsky and Koshchenets—and twoprivates, and wounded five officers and twelve privates. 
 Theofficial paper says nothing about the number of the insur-gents killed. 
 Such is the scant information, clearly incomplete and clearly distorted and minimised by the police, that we nowhave at our disposal. 
 But what do these facts mean?They fully confirm what was pointed out in the decisions of the All-Russia Conference of the R.

 * A revolutionary upswing has begun in Russia. 
 With the mass strikes in April and May the Russian proletariat beganto pass to the offensive—against capital and against the tsarist monarchy, for a better life for the workers, worn out by counter-revolutionary persecution and tyranny in1908-11, and for freedom for the whole people, for a demo-cratic republic. 
 It is an idle tale the liberals are putting about (followed by the Nevsky Golos liquidators) when they say that the *See pp. 
 102-09 of this volume.

 /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR basis of the April-May movement was the struggle for free-dom of association. 
 The facts belie that tale. 
 One cannot fight for only one of the political rights in enslaved Russia, nor can one fight for constitutional reforms under the tsaristautocracy. 
 The struggle of the proletariat swept over Russiain a wave of strikes that were both economic and political. 
 The strength of the movement lay, and lies, in the combina-tion of the two types of strike. 
 They are not ordinary strikes, they mark a revolutionary upsurge of the masses, the begin-ning of an offensive by the mass of the workers against the tsarist monarchy. 
 The mass strikes were bound to kindle the flames of revo-lution everywhere . 
 And the outbreaks of revolt among the armed forces are a proof that those flames are flaring up— there is inflammable material everywhere , and everywhere a revolutionary mood is growing among the masses, includ-ing even those workers and peasants who are held downby barrack drill. 
 The mass strikes in Russia are inseparably ]inked with an armed uprising. 
 Where strikes grow, the uprising grows too. 
 That is what the events mentioned at the beginning of this article have shown. 
 Those events provide a lesson which is pointed out in the Central Organ, Sotsial-Demokrat No. 
 27. 
 Appeals for an uprising are most unwise now. 
 An uprising would be premature . 
 Only a combined onslaught by the mass of the workers, by the peasantry and the best section of the armedforces can create conditions for a victorious , i. 
e. 
, timely uprising. 
 And the foremost workers must do their utmost to strengthen, restore and develop the illegal party of the working class, the R.

It is only by being at the head of the onslaught of the millions, and only in the closest inseparable alliancewith them, that the revolutionary section of Russia’s armedforces can and will defeat the tsarist monarchy! Rabochaya Gazeta No. 
 9, Published according July 30 (August 12),113 1912 to the text in Rabochaya Gazeta ON THE EVE OF THE ELECTIONS TO THE FOURTH DUMA On the eve of the elections the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party has come forward, despite cruel persecution,despite wholesale arrests, with a clearer, more distinct and more precise programme, tactics and platform than any other party. 
 In January 1912 the All-Russia Conference of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 summed up the results of the ideological andpolitical work carried out by the Party in the grim years ofthe counter-revolution. 
 The Conference decisions gave an-swers to all the pressing questions of the movement. 
 Thanks to those decisions, the election platform was simply a finalstatement. 
 The platform was published by the Central Com-mittee in Russia and was then reprinted by a whole seriesof local organisations. 
 114 The whole bourgeois press reported the Conference and published some of its decisions. 
 In the six months since the Conference, work has been going on through the Party press and dozens of reports, inhundreds of speeches in factory groups and at the meetingsheld in April and May, to explain the Conference decisionsand to put them into effect. 
 The Party’s slogans—a repub-lic, an eight-hour working day, confiscation of the landed estates—have spread throughout Russia and have been ac-cepted by the foremost proletarians. 
 The revolutionaryupsurge of the masses, its expression ranging from strikesand meetings to revolts in the armed forces, has provedthese slogans to be correct and vital. 
 Our Party has already made use of the elections, and very extensively too. 
 No amount of “interpretation” by the po-lice, no amount of falsification of the Fourth Duma (by thepriesthood or otherwise) can nullify this result. 
 Propaganda, organised strictly on Party lines, has already been carried out everywhere and has set the tone for the entire election, campaign of the Social-Democrats. 
 The bourgeois parties in a hasty, slapdash manner are writing “platforms for the elections”, for promises, for hoodwinking the voters. 
 The liquidators, too, who are trail-ing behind the liberals, are now devising a legal “platform for the elections”. 
 The liquidators are making a fuss about platforms in the legal, censored press as they prepare to cover up their utter confusion, disorganisation, and lack of ideo-logical principle, with a respectable, law-abiding “platformfor the elections”. 
 Not a platform “for the elections”, but elections to imple-ment the revolutionary Social-Democratic platform!—that is how the Party of the working class sees it. 
 We have al-ready used the elections to this end, and will use them tothe hilt. 
 We will use even the most reactionary tsarist Dumato advocate the revolutionary platform, tactics and pro-gramme of the Russian S. 
D. 
 Labour Party. 
 Truly valuableare only those platforms that complete the long work of revolutionary agitation, which has already given full an-swers to all the questions of the movement, and not those platforms (particularly the legal ones!) that are composedin all haste as a stop-gap and as a noisy advertisement, asin the case of the liquidators. 
 Six months have passed since the Party re-established itself. 
 Overcoming incredible difficulties, suffering from fierce persecution and experiencing breaks in the work ofthis or that local centre or of the common centre—the Cen-tral Committee—the Party is definitely going forward,extending its work and its influence among the masses. 
 Thisextension of the work is taking place in a new form : in addi-tion to the illegal nuclei, which are secret and narrow, and better disguised than before, there is broader legal Marxistpropaganda. 
 It is just this distinctive character of the newpreparations for revolution in the new conditions that haslong been noted and acknowledged by the Party. 
 And we can now give a full answer to the noisy utterances of the liquidators, who threaten us with “duplicate candi-dates”. 
 Empty threats that scare no one! The liquidatorsare so badly beaten and impotent that no amount of help can revive them. 
 They cannot so much as think of putting up “duplicate candidates”; if they did so, they would win a pitiful, ludicrously insignificant number of votes. 
 They know this and will not try the experiment. 
 They aremaking a noise merely to divert attention and conceal thetruth. 
 We said “no amount of help”. 
 The liquidators are counting on help from abroad. 
 Their friends—particularly the Letts, the Bund, and Trotsky—have announced the convocation of ten “centres, organisations and factions”! Don’t laugh! The world abroad is rich, great and bountiful. 
 As many as“ten centres”!! The methods used in this case are the sameas with the government in the Fourth Duma: preparationsfor setting up a representative body, and the conversion of a number of ciphers into the semblance of “big numbers”. 
 First of all, Trotsky (in Russia he is a cipher, he is only acontributor to Zhivoye Dyelo , and his agents are only defend-ers of the liquidators’ “initiating groups”). 
 Secondly, Golos Sotsial-Demokrata , i. 
e. 
, the selfsame impotent liquidators. 
 Thirdly, the “Caucasian Regional Committee”, also a ci-pher, in a third garb. 
 Fourthly, the “Organising Commit-tee”—a fourth garb of the very same liquidators. 
 Fifthly and sixthly, the Letts and the Bund, which is wholly liquida-tionist today. 
 But enough! Needless to say our Party is laughing at this game of non-entities abroad. 
 They cannot resuscitate a corpse, for the liquidators in Russia are a corpse. 
 Here are the facts. 
For six months the liquidators and all their friends have been waging a desperate struggle against the Party. 
 Thereexists a legal Marxist press. 
 It is fearfully handicapped, and does not dare utter a word about a republic, our Party, upris-ing, or the tsar’s gang. 
 It would be simply ridiculous to think of advocating the slogans of the R.

 throughthat press. 
 But the worker in Russia is no longer what he used to be. 
 He has become a force. 
 He has paved a way for himself. 
He has his own press, which is handicapped but belongs to him and defends Marxism theoretically . 
 In this open arena, everyone can see the “successes” of the liquidators’ struggle against the anti-liquidators. 
 S. 
 V. 
 115 of Vperyod has already pointed out those successes in Trots-ky’s Vienna, liquidationist, Pravda . 
 The fact is, he wrote, that the workers’ collections go almost entirely to the anti-liquidators. 
 But he sought to comfort himself, saying thatit is not because the workers sympathise with the “Leninists”. 
 Why, naturally “not because”, dear friend of the liquida-tors! But still, look at the facts. 
 Six months of open struggle for a workers ’ daily news-paper . 
 The liquidators have been shouting about it since 1910. 
 What about their success? In six months—from January 1to July 1, 1912—their papers, Zhivoye Dyelo and Nevsky Golos , carried the accounts of 15 (fifteen ) collections made by groups of workers for a workers ’ daily newspaper! Fif-teen groups of workers in six months! Take the newspapers of the anti-liquidators. 
 See their accounts of the collections made for a workers’ daily duringthe same six-month period. 
 Add up the number of collec-tions by groups of workers. 
 You will find that there were 504 contributions by workers ’ groups ! Here are exact monthly data for the various parts of Russia: Number of workers ’ group contributions for a workers ’ daily newspaper during the first half of 1912 In anti-In anti-liquidationist liquidationist newspapers newspapers January ............ 14 0 February ............ 18 0 March .............

 The liquidators are a corpse, and no number of terrible (oh, how terrible!) “associa-tions of groups, centres, factions, trends and tendencies”abroad can revive this corpse. 
 No shrill manifestos abroad and no fake conferences between “initiating groups” and the liquidators can undoor alleviate this complete defeat of the liquidators in the eyes of hundreds of workers ’ groups in Russia . 
 The unity of the election campaign of the worker Social-Democrats in Russia is assured . 
 It is assured not through “agreements” with the liquidators, but through the completevictory over the liquidators, who have already been reducedto their true role, the role of liberal intellectuals. 
 See how well Savin, the Socialist-Revolutionary liquidator, fits into Nasha Zarya . 
 See how warmly L. 
 M. 
 116 praises, in Listok Golosa Sotsial-Demokrata , “the initiative” of the Socialist-Revolutionaries, who repeatedly stray (becauseof an otzovist hangover!) into liquidationism. 
 Ponder onthe significance of the fact that the same sheet holds up the well-known Socialist-Revolutionary “leader”, Avksentyev, as an example for Plekhanov. 
 Remember how all liquidators kiss the non-Social-Democratic Left wing of the Polish Socialist Party. 
 Liquidators of all parties, unite! Everyone finds his niche in the end. 
 Groups of intellec-tualist liquidators from among former Marxists and former liberals with a bomb are being welded together by the course of events.

, it has, in the six months since it regained its freedom fromthe bondage of those who had liquidated it, made a hugestride forward, as can be seen from the facts cited. 
 Rabochaya Gazeta No. 
 9, Published according July 30 (August 12), 1912 to the text in Rabochaya Gazeta CAN THE SLOGAN “FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION ” SERVE AS A BASIS FOR THE WORKING-CLASS MOVEMENT TODAY? In the legal press, the liquidators headed by Trotsky argue that it can. 
 They are doing all in their power to distort the true character of the workers’ movement. 
 But those are hopeless efforts. 
 The drowning liquidators are clutching ata straw to rescue their unjust cause. 
 In 1910 little groups of intellectuals began a campaign of petitions for freedom of association. 
 It was an artificial campaign. 
 The mass of the workers remained indifferent. 
 One cannot fire the proletariat with so futile an undertaking. 
 It was fitting for liberals to believe in political reformsunder the tsarist autocracy. 
 The workers at once saw through the falsity of the undertaking and remained aloof. 
 The workers are not against the struggle for reforms— they fought for the Insurance Bill. 
 Through their deputies they used every opportunity in the Third Duma to bring about at least slight improvements. 
 But the point is that theThird Duma and the Insurance Bill are not fiction, butpolitical facts, while “freedom of association” under the June Third monarchy of Romanov is an empty promise fromrotten liberals. 
 The liberals are enemies of the revolution. 
 Even now they are outspoken in their opposition to it—the Black-Hundred Third Duma has not taught them to throw off theirfear of the revolution. 
 Being afraid of the revolution,the liberals comfort themselves with the hope of constitu-tional reforms and advocate for the workers one of those reforms, freedom of association. 
 But the workers do not believe the fable about a “con-stitution” under the conditions of the Third Duma, general lack of rights, and unbridled tyranny. 
 The workers demand freedom of association in earnest and therefore they are fighting for freedom for the whole people, for the overthrow of the monarchy , for a republic. 
 The strikes in April and May showed in point of fact that the proletariat had risen in a revolutionary strike . 
 The combination of the economic and political strike, revolu-tionary meetings, and the slogan of a republic advanced by the St. 
 Petersburg workers on May Day—all these facts were conclusive proof of the beginning of a revolutionary upswing . 
 The factual, objective situation in Russia is this: the proletariat has begun a revolutionary struggle of the massesto overthrow the tsarist monarchy, and unrest in the armed forces is growing—an indication that they have joined in the struggle. 
 As for the peasant democrats, the best amongthem are turning away from the liberals to lend ear to theworking-class vanguard. 
 Meanwhile the liberals, enemies of the revolution, up-hold only the “constitutional” path and put forward, against the revolution, the promise (an empty and false promise) of “freedom of association” under Russia’s tsarist monarchy! Such is the actual political situation. 
 And these are the real social forces: (1) the tsarist monarchy, which flouts all“constitution”; (2) the liberal-monarchist bourgeois, who outof fear of the revolution pretend that they believe in a combi-nation of “freedom” and the tsarist regime, and (3) the revo-lutionary democrats; from the midst of the latter a leaderhas already risen—the mass of the workers, to whose appealthe sailors and soldiers, from Helsingfors to Tashkent, areresponding. 
 How hopelessly stupid, under the circumstances, is the liquidators’ talk about “freedom of association”! Of all “reforms”, these sages of liberal labour policy have chosenan impossible constitutional reform, which is nothing but a promise, and they are amusing themselves by playing at“European” constitutionalism. 
 It won’t do! The workers are casting aside the liberals and liberal labour policy. 
 They will support, develop and make an object of their campaigns, every reform that really be-comes an immediate issue—both in the Third and in the Fourth Duma—from insurance to increased salaries for those who slave in offices. 
 But the workers laugh contemptuously at the empty and absurd promise of a constitutional political reform under the autocracy. 
 May the revolutionary struggle begun bythe masses in order to overthrow the monarchy and win arepublic grow in scale and intensity! The struggle willshow what half-hearted constitutional reforms will result in if the new revolution is defeated , but to suggest to the masses a non-revolutionary road, a peaceful constitutional reform, now, at the beginning of a revolutionary onslaught, issomething that only the “man in a muffler” 117 can do. 
 The revolutionary onslaught which has begun calls for revolutionary slogans.

 QUESTIONS OF PRINCIPLE A slight increase in the election campaign activity, and the official-Cadet Rech has begun to speak (it has done so at last!) of the differences it has with the Lefts over questionsof principle. 
 “We never intended, nor do we intend, to make peace with the June Third regime,” writes Rech. 
 That is not true. 
 You did intend and you do intend to, Cadet gentlemen. 
 Evidence of it is your talk about a “re-sponsible” opposition and an opposition in the possessivecase. 
 That is not merely “intending” peace, but a policy of“peace” with the June Third regime. 
 And what about Karaulov’s pious speeches in the pious Third Duma? Or the Cadets’ voting for the budget and for its more important items? Or the speeches of Berezovskythe First on the agrarian question? Or Gredeskul’s recentstatements, repeated in Rech ? Does not all that amount to a policy of peace with the foundations of the June Third regime? It certainly does. 
 “Over a period of five years,” writes Rech , “we have never seen any difference between the tactics of the Social-Democratic Party within the framework of the Duma and those of other opposition par-ties. 
 Yet in this case it is a question of elections to the Duma. 
 ” There you have a specimen of sophistry and distortion of the truth! Not on a single question have Social-Democratic tactics in the Duma been akin to Cadet tactics. 
 They have been fundamentally different on all questions: they have not been tactics of “peace” or of liberalism; they have always been tactics of democracy and the class struggle . 
 Does Rech really maintain that mere “voting against” can be described as kinship in tactics, instead of kinship in posing questions from the standpoint of principle i n the Duma speeches and in the formulas of procedure? Does Rech really venture to say that it is permissible to say one thing in the Duma and another outside it? But ifit does, is it not because it wants to hush up the issue of theundemocratic character of Cadet propaganda outside the Duma ? “We cannot deny the ‘democratic’ movement, which we serve ourselves, the right to independent aims and actions,” writes Rech . 
 That is not true, educated liberal gentlemen! See if you can state your fundamental views on the distinction betweenliberalism and democracy. 
 See if you can illustrate yourviews with examples from English, French or German his-tory, even leaving out specifically working-class, prole-tarian, Marxist democracy. 
 You will not be able to deny the distinction between bourgeois liberalism and bourgeoisdemocracy as regards their attitude to the old order. 
 Andwe shall always prove to you that you are a party of theliberal-monarchist bourgeoisie and not at all a democraticparty. 
 Bourgeois democracy in Russia is represented by the Tru-doviks and Narodniks of all types. 
 “Once you have set your hand to the plough you can’t give up. 
” You have set out to discuss the principles of theCadets and the Lefts, so you must really explain thoseprinciples. 
 That is the only way to raise election agitation somewhat above the question of how many lawless acts such-and-such a police officer, governor, or administrativebody is guilty of. 
 Pravda No. 
 79, July 31, 1912 Published according to the Pravda text THE LAST VALVE We concluded our previous article on the agrarian ques-tion in Russia today (see Nevskaya Zvezda No. 
 15) as fol-lows: “The real similarity between the Stolypin and the Na-rodnik agrarian programmes lies in the fact that bothadvocate a radical break-up of the old, medieval system oflandownership. 
 And that is very good. 
 That system deservesno better than to be broken up. 
 The most reactionary of allare those Cadets of Rech a nd Russkiye Vedomosti who reproach Stolypin for causing a break-up, instead of proving the need for a still more consistent and resolute break-up. 
 We shallsee in a following article that the Stolypin type of break-upcannot do away with bondage and labour service, while the Narodnik type can. 
 “For the time being we shall note that the only entirely real result of the Stolypin break-up is a famine among 30 million people. 
 And it remains to be seen whether the Sto-lypin break-up may not teach the Russian people how they should carry out a more thorough break-up. 
 It is no doubt teaching that. 
 But will it succeed in it? Time will tell. 
” * And so, the question now confronting us is: why is it that the Stolypin break-up of medieval landownership cannot , while the peasant-Trudovik or Narodnik break-up can, do away with bondage and labour service? In starting to analyse this question, we shall note first of all that one of the fundamental defects of the most wide-spread arguments concerning this matter—arguments that are liberal, Narodnik and partly revisionist (P. 
 Maslov)— *See pp. 
 148-49 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 is the abstract presentation of the question, ignoring the concrete historical “replacement” which is actually coming about. 
 The replacement coming about in Russia has long since occurred in the advanced countries of the West: itis the replacement of a feudal by a capitalist economy. 
 It is, and can only be, a question of the forms, condi-tions, rapidity and circumstances of this replacement; all other considerations, which are not infrequently put in the forefront, are no more than an unwitting beating about the bush, the “bush” being precisely this replacement. 
 The predominant feudal form of modern Russian agricul-ture is bondage and labour service. 
 The preservation of natu-ral economy to a comparatively considerable degree, theexistence of the small cultivator who cannot make both ends meet and farms on a tiny patch of poor land, using old, wretchedly inadequate implements and production methods,and the economic dependence of this small cultivator on theowner of the neighbouring latifundium, who exploits himnot only as a wage-labourer (which marks the beginning ofcapitalism), but as a small cultivator (which is a continua-tion of the corvée system)—these are the conditions engen-dering bondage and labour service, or rather, characterisingboth the one and the other. 
 For the 30,000 big landlords in European Russia there are 10,000,000 households of the peasant poor. 
 The averageresult is roughly the following: one landlord owning over 2,000 dessiatines is surrounded by some 300 peasant house-holds, each owning approximately 7 dessiatines of poorand exhausted land and equipped with implements that areincredibly outdated and primitive (from the European pointof view, to say nothing of the American). 
 Some of the well-to-do peasants “get on in the world”, i. 
e. 
, become petty bourgeois using wage-labour to cultivate their land. 
 The landlords, many of whom yesterday wereserf-owning lords or are their sons, resort to the same kindof labour on a certain part of their land and for certainfarming operations. 
 But besides these capitalist relations, and pushing them into the background in all the purely Russian gubernias of European Russia, there is the cultivation of landlord landby peasants using their own implements and livestock, that is to say, labour service, a continuation of the former corvée, and there is also the “utilisation” of the desperate want of the small cultivator (precisely as a cultivator , as a small proprietor) for “service” on the neighbouring landed estate,that is to say, bondage . 
 Money loans in exchange for work, grain loans, winter hire, land lease, permission to usethe road, watering-place, meadows, pastures and woods, thelending of implements and livestock, and so on and so forth, are all infinitely varied forms of modern bondage. 
 Things are sometimes pushed to the length of obliging the peasant to fertilise the landlord’s fields with manurefrom his own farm, while the “housewife” is obliged toprovide eggs—and this not in the eighteenth, but in thetwentieth century A. 
 D. 
! One has only to pose clearly and precisely the problem of these survivals of medievalism and feudalism in modernRussian agriculture to appreciate the significance of theStolypin “reform”. 
 This “reform”, of course, gave dyingserfdom a new lease of life, just as the notorious, so-called“peasant” (in reality landlord ), Reform of 1861, extolled by the liberals and Narodniks, gave a new lease of life to the corvée system, perpetuating it in a different guise right upto 1905. 
 The “new lease of life” given by Stolypin to the old order and old feudal agriculture lies in the fact that another valvewas opened, the last that could still be opened without ex-propriating all the landed estates. 
 That valve was opened to let off some of the steam—in the sense that some of thethoroughly impoverished peasants acquired a title to theirallotments as personal property and sold them, thus beingconverted from proletarians with an allotment into prole-tarians pure and simple, and that, furthermore, some of the well-to-do peasants, having acquired their allotments, and in some cases having settled on otrubs , built up even more solid capitalist farms than before. 
 Lastly, the valve was opened and some of the steam let off in the sense that in some areas a particularly intolerabletype of strip holding was abolished and the mobilisation of peasant land required under capitalism was made easier. 
 But did this new lease of life decrease or increase the over-all number of contradictions in the countryside? Did it decrease or increase the tyranny of the feudal latifundia, or the total amount of “steam”? The answer to these questions can only be the second alternative. 
 The famine among 30 million peasants is factual proof that the only answer which can be given at present is thesecond alternative. 
 It is a famine among small proprietors. 
It presents a picture of the crisis of the same old poverty-ridden peasant farming, shackled by bondage and crushed by the feudal latifundia. 
 There are no such famines, nor can there be, in the case of the big non-feudal estates, of the capi-talist latifundia, in Europe. 
 The plight of the mass of the peasantry, apart from the proletarians who have completely freed themselves from theland (who “acquired” their land in order to sell it) and a negligible minority of well-to-do peasants, is the same as before or has even become worse. 
 No acquiring of hold-ings as personal property, no measures against strip hold-ings, can make the mass of the impoverished peasants—settled on poor, exhausted land and possessing only anti-quated, thoroughly worn-out implements and starved draught animals and cattle—to any extent cultured, to any extent masters of their farms. 
 Around a landlord (of the Markov or Purishkevich type) owning 2,000 dessiatines of land, the owners of tiny seven-dessiatine plots will inevitably remain paupers in bondage,however much they may be resettled, however much they may be freed from the village commune, however much their paupers’ plots may be “acquired” as their personalproperty. 
 The Stolypin reform cannot do away with the bondage and labour service of the mass of the peasants or with faminesamong them. 
 Decades upon decades of similar periodical famines will be needed before the bulk of the present-day households dies out painfully and the Stolypin reform “suc-ceeds”, i. 
e. 
, before the established bourgeois system of thegeneral European type is introduced in our countryside. 
At present, however, after a six-year trial of the Stolypin“reform” and six years of “brilliant” progress in the number of those who have “acquired” their land, etc. 
, there cannot be the slightest doubt that the reform has not removed thecrisis and cannot remove it. 
 Both at the present time and for the immediate future, it is beyond all question that Russia confronts us with the old crisis of an economy which is feudal as regards a number of survivals, the old crisis of pauperised small farming heldin bondage by the latifundia of the Markov or Purishkevichtype. 
 And this crisis, so graphically documented by the famine of 30 million peasants, confronts us despite Stolypin having opened the last valve that the Markovs and Purishkeviches have. 
 They (and the Council of the United Nobility along with them) could have thought up nothing else, * nor can anything else be thought up to enable the Purishkevichesto retain land and power, than the pursuit of a bourgeoispolicy by these same Purishkeviches. 
 This is actually what the contradictions of the modern Russian countryside amount to: the pursuit of a bourgeoisagrarian policy by the former serf-owners, who fully retaintheir land and their power. 
 In the agrarian sphere, this isalso “a step towards transformation into a bourgeoismonarchy”. 
 ** This step towards the new has been taken by the old, which has retained its omnipotence, its land, its generalappearance and conditions. 
 This is the last step that the oldcan still take. 
 It is the last valve. 
 There are not, and cannotbe, any other valves at the disposal of the Purishkeviches,who are in command of a bourgeois country. 
 And precisely because this step towards the new has been taken by the old, which has retained its omnipotence,it could not produce, and will not produce, any lasting re-sult. 
 On the contrary, it is leading—as shown clearly byall the symptoms of the period we are passing through—tothe growth of the old crisis at a different and higher stage of Russia’s capitalist development. 
 *It goes without saying that the phrase “thought up” should be taken with a grain of salt: the imagination of the class in command was limited and determined by the entire course of the capitalistdevelopment of Russia and the world as a whole. 
 With the given align-ment of the classes in a Russia developing along capitalist lines, theCouncil of the United Nobility could not have acted otherwise if itwanted to retain its power.

 The old crisis is growing in a new way, in a new situa-tion, at a time when the class relations have become much more definite; but it is growing, and its social and economic (and not merely economic) nature remains essentially un-changed. 
 A negligible number of good, otrub farms of the peasant bourgeoisie, while the number of proletarians bound toallotments is declining, while the Purishkeviches retain their omnipotence, while the vast mass of the pauperised and starving middle peasants are in bondage, and while thenumber of proletarians not bound to allotments is increas-ing—such is the picture of the Russian countryside today. 
 Does it still have to be demonstrated that the Stolypin agrarian programme cannot, while the Narodnik (in the historical and class sense of the term) programme can, abol-ish bondage and labour service? Surely the present situationin the countryside must suggest that given full freedom ofmobilisation of the land, good otrub farms would inevitably put an end at once to all medieval famines, to all bondageand labour service, if such farms were set up by the free choice of the peasants on all the seventy million dessiatines of landed estates which for the time being are outside the“land distribution system”? And will not the irony ofhistory compel us to say that Stolypin’s land surveyorshave come in handy for a Trudovik Russia? Nevskaya Zvezda No.

 A LITTLE EXPLANATION The question whether our Cadets are democrats or a party of the liberal-monarchist bourgeoisie is of great scientificinterest. 
 Let us recall that even the Trudovik (bourgeois demo-crat) Vodovozov showed vacillation on this question. 
 Concerning this question, Pravda referred to Mr. 
 Gre-deskul ’s recent statements , repeated in “Rech ”. 
 * Rech answers: “We do not know what statements by Mr. 
 Gredeskul Pravda is talking about. 
” How very nice, isn’t it? Pravda said in clear and pre-cise terms that it was speaking of the statements repeated in Rech . 
 Well? Can it be that Rech does not know what is published in Rech ?? Would it not be more natural to sup-pose that the liberals want to forget certain things in their recent past for the sake of their pre-election playing at democracy? Be that as it may, I shall quote, with a view to clarifying an important scientific question, what Mr. 
 Gredeskul saidin a series of public lectures and what he repeated in Rech No. 
 117 (2071), without the editors making a single reser-vation. 
 “At the very end of my lecture,” wrote Mr. 
 Gredeskul, “in ar-guing against the contention of Vekhi that the Russian emancipation movement had failed (allegedly through the fault of the intelligent-sia) and comparing it with the opinion of those who stand much fur-ther to the left than P. 
 B. 
 Struve but who likewise believe that themovement has brought us absolutely nothing, I upheld a thesis tothe contrary, saying that a very great deal had been done, that thevery foundations had been laid for the future constitutional edifice, and very deeply and solidly, too, in the very midst of the masses of *See p.

 the people. 
 To provide a critical confrontation for these two asser-tions and at the same time to express an idea which I also consider ofthe utmost political importance for our time, I brought both of theminto relation with the future and said that from the point of view of the former (if nothing had been done in 1905-06), everything had to be started from the beginning, or, in other words, a second movementhad to be organised, whereas from the point of view of the latter asser-tion (that 1905-06 had seen the laying of the foundations for a Rus-sian constitution), the opposite was true—no second popular move-ment was needed but merely quiet, persevering and confident con-stitutional work. 
 “It was at this point that I was interrupted by the Lepaya chief of police (it happened in Lepaya). 
 In this manner there ensued in Lepayaa police demonstration against a public denial of the need for a newrevolution in Russia” ( Rech , 1912, No. 
 117 [2071]). 
 Mr. 
 Gredeskul has fully proved that the Lepaya chief of police made a mistake. 
 But besides this, Mr. 
 Gredeskul has proved two important things: (1) that the polemics ofMr. 
 Gredeskul and Co. 
 against Vekhi are so much pretence and empty talk. 
 Actually, in all essential respects, thewhole Cadet Party is a Vekhi party; (2) that the Marxist characterisation of the Cadet Party according to its scien-tific, economic and political features is perfectly correct.

 to the Pravda text WORKERS ’ EARNINGS AND CAPITALIST PROFITS IN RUSSIA A survey of factories in Russia was made in 1908. 
120 There is no doubt that the survey gave exaggerated figures of theworkers’ earnings and understated the amount of production and the size of the capitalists’ profits, for in our country all surveys of this kind are carried out on purely bureaucraticlines, inquiries being addressed only to the capitalists, whileit is considered unnecessary to ask the workers any ques-tions. 
 Let us see what these statistics, which are particularly advantageous for the capitalists, have revealed. 
 According to preliminary information—which is all that has been published so far—there were altogether nearly20,000 factories in Russia (the exact figure is 19,983; weshall give the exact figures in parentheses but shall roundthem off in the text to make it easier for the reader to visu-alise and remember the principal data). 
 The total number of workers of both sexes was 2,250,000 (2,253,787), including mining workers and workers employedin the industries subject to excise duty. 
 The wages of all those workers totalled more than 500 mil-lion (555,700,000) rubles. 
 To find out the average pay per worker, we must divide the total of wages by the number of workers. 
 We get thefigure 246 rubles. 
 This means that in 1908 two and a quarter million Rus-sian factory workers earned a mere twenty rubles fifty kopeks a month on the average! Considering that with this sum the worker has to support his family, and this with the present high rents and highfood prices, such pay must be described as meagre. 
 Let us now see what the profits of the capitalists are. 
 To ascertain them, we must subtract all the outlays of the capi-talists from the sum total of production, i. 
e. 
, the gross re-ceipts of all the factories. 
 The sum total of production exceeds 4,500 million (4,651 million) rubles, and all the outlays of the capitalists total4. 
000 million (4,082 million) rubles. 
 It follows that the capitalists’ profits exceed 500 ,000,000 rubles (568,700,000 rubles). 
 These profits average 28,500 rubles per establishment. 
 Each worker brings the capitalist a profit of 252 rubles a year . 
 Let us now compare the workers’ earnings and the capi-talists’ profits. 
 Each worker receives, on the average, 246 rubles a year, but he brings the capitalist an average profit of 252 rubles a year. 
 * It follows that the worker works the lesser part of the day for himself and the greater part of it for the capitalist. 
 If, for example, we take the working day to average 11 hours,we shall see that the worker is paid only for five and a half hours and even somewhat less than that. 
 The other five and a half hours he works gratuitously, without receivingany pay, and the entire sum earned by him during thishalf day constitutes the capitalist’s profit.

 the Pravda text *Altogether the worker creates an annual 498 rubles’ worth of new values. 
 THE STRIKE MOVEMENT AND WAGES Everyone knows that the famous strike movement of the Russian workers in 1905 achieved very great successes notonly in the political, but in the economic sphere as well. 
 The data furnished by the reports of factory inspectors 121 now enable us to form a fairly accurate idea of the magni-tude of those successes. 
 According to those data, the average earnings of a factory worker were: in 1901 ...... 201 rubles in 1906 ...... 231 rubles ”1902 ...... 202 ”” 1907 ...... 241 ” ”1903 ...... 208 ”” 1908 ...... 242 ” ”1904 ...... 213 ”” 1909 ...... 236 ” ”1905 ...... 205 ”” 1910 ...... 242 ” average for five years 206 ” average for five years 238 ” This shows that the year 1905 was a turning-point. 
 For it was after 1905 that wages rose abruptly from 205 to 231 rubles a year, i. 
e. 
, by 26 rubles , or more than 10 per cent. 
 With regard to 1905, which shows a drop of 8 rubles in wages compared with 1904, the following must be borne inmind: firstly, 1905 was a year of economic depression, i. 
e. 
,a slump in industry; secondly, according to data of the Min-istry of Trade, the workers that year lost, through not re-ceiving wages during strikes, 17,500,000 rubles , or over 10 rubles per worker on the average. 
 Thus, we may assume that real wages in 1905 were 215 rubles a year, but out of these 215 rubles the workers con-tributed 10 rubles each to the strike movement, which in 1905 was distinguished by remarkable persistence and breadth, unprecedented anywhere else in the world. 
 The result is that as we now examine the data for a whole decade, 1901-10, we clearly see a striking difference between the pre-revolutionary and post-revolutionary epoch. 
 Until 1905 the Russian factory worker’s wages averaged 206 rubles. 
 After 1905, they averaged 238 rubles, i. 
e. 
, 32 rubles more per year —an increase of 15. 
5 per cent. 
 Within one year wages experienced such an upward leap that no subsequent efforts by the capitalists (who, it will be recalled, took away all the gains of 1905 one by one) were able to reduce the worker to his former low standardof living. 
 The year 1905 improved the worker’s living stand-ard to a degree that normally is attained during severaldecades. 
 Through the strikes in 1905 the workers lost, according to official statistics, 17,500,000 rubles by not being paid wages during the strikes. 
 According to the same source, thecapitalists’ drop in output in 1905 was 127,300,000 rubles. 
 The rise in wages after 1905, however, brought the work-ers an average gain of 32 rubles per worker in five years(1906-1910), i. 
e. 
, a total of 57,600,000 rubles a year, or 286 million rubles in five years , considering the number of workers to be 1,800,000.

 86, August 9, 1912 Published according to the Pravda text THE WORKING DAY IN THE FACTORIES OF MOSCOW GUBERNIA I. 
 M. 
 Kozminykh-Lanin, an engineer, has published a book on the length of the working day and working year in thefactories of Moscow Gubernia. 
 The data collected by the author relate to the end of 1908 and cover 219,669 workers, or a little over seven-tenths ofthe total number of factory workers in Moscow Gubernia(307,773). 
 On the basis of these data, the author finds the average working day to be 9 2 hours for adults and juveniles and 72 hours for those under age. 
 It should be noted that these data do not include overtime work (the author has prepared for the press a special book onovertime work) and, secondly, that the author’s data arebased solely on “obligatory regulations for employers andworkers”. 
 Whether these regulations are actually adhered to is a question our engineer does not raise. 
 Only workers’ unions,by compiling their own statistics, could collect data on thisquestion as well. 
 This 9 2 -hour day varies greatly from one establishment to another. 
 The author’s tables show that 33,466 workers work over 10 hours a day ! This covers more than 15 per cent of the total number of workers surveyed. 
 There are 13,189 workers who work over 11 hours a day , and 75 workers who work over 12 hours a day. 
 The bulkof the workers crushed by this excessively long working day belongs to the textile industry. 
 If it is taken into account that approximately one-third of the workers are not included in the author’s survey, the conclusion can be drawn that the working day of more than 20,000 factory workers in Moscow Gubernia is monstrously long. 
 Lastly, Kozminykh-Lanin’s data show that even the ex-tremely obsolete Russian law of 1897, which permits an112 -hour (!!!) day, is not observed by the factory owners . 
 Under that law, when working in two shifts, no worker maywork more than 9 hours a day, calculated over a fortnight. 
 In reality, however, out of the 83,990 two-shift workers surveyed by the author, 14,376 worked over 9 hours . 
 This comprises 17 per cent of the total number of those workingin two shifts. 
 And of the 3,733 two-shift workers engagedin repair and auxiliary jobs, 2,173, or nearly three-fifths , worked over 9 hours a day! A total of 16,500 workers who are compelled—even according to official data—to work longer than allowed by the law! An eight-hour day existed in Moscow Gubernia in 1908 only for 4,398 workers—out of the 219,669 surveyed. 
 Thismeans that an eight-hour day is perfectly feasible even today;it is only necessary for 215,000 workers to overtake those 4,000.

 to the Pravda text THE WORKING DAY AND WORKING YEAR IN MOSCOW GUBERNIA The work bearing this title, from the pen of Kozminykh-Lanin, an engineer (Moscow, 1912, published by the Stand-ing Commission of the Museum for the Promotion of Labourunder the Moscow Branch of the Imperial Russian TechnicalSociety. 
 Price, 1 ruble 75 kopeks), is a summary of datarelating to the end of 1908. 
 The data cover 219,669 workers, or 71,37 per cent of the total number of factory workers in the gubernia (307,773). 
 The author says that he has “carefully studied the data oneach industrial establishment in particular”, and has “includ-ed in the summary only that part of it which left no roomfor doubt”. 
 Such statistics would have been of outstanding interest, even though they come very late, had the data been tabulated more sensibly. 
 Unfortunately, it is precisely this word thathas to be used, for while Mr. 
 Kozminykh-Lanin has compiledhis tables most carefully, putting a very great deal of la-bour into the calculation of all sorts of totals and percentageshe has expended this labour irrationally. 
 The wealth of material seems to have overwhelmed the author. 
 He has made hundreds and thousands of calculationsthat are absolutely superfluous and only encumbered hiswork, but he has not made some dozens of calculations thatare absolutely necessary, since no general picture can be ob-tained without them. 
 Indeed, the author’s principal tables, which almost fill the whole of his book, contain detailed figures, such, for in-stance, as that the workers who work from 9 to 10 hours a day are divided into 16 categories according to the number of working hours in two successive weeks (from 109 to 120 hours), and the average number of working hours is calcu-lated for each category! And all this has been done twice:for the workers engaged in production and for the auxiliaryworkers. 
 It has to be admitted that such detailing is, first of all, absolutely unnecessary and that it looks like indulging in statistics for their own sake, a kind of game with fig-ures, to the detriment of a clear picture and of material fit for study. 
 Secondly, nine-tenths of these “averages”, whichthe author has calculated to an accuracy of one per cent, aresimply a waste of labour, for out of a thousand readers ofthe book (which will hardly find a thousand readers), only one reader will perhaps think this sort of “average” necessary (moreover, that one reader could have calculated it for himself if he had been so unfortunate as to need it!). 
 On the other hand, the book completely lacks absolutely indispensable summaries that the author could have drawn up with far less expenditure of labour and which one cannot do without if one wants to make a sensible study of the data of the survey. 
 There are no summaries (1) giving totals, byproduction groups, of workers who work in one, two and threeshifts; (2) classing workers according to production andauxiliary jobs; (3) giving average working hours accordingto production groups; (4) giving totals of working time of adults and juveniles; (5) singling out factories with various numbers of workers. 
 Let us dwell on this last point. 
 The author seems so dili-gent—judging by the list he gives of the works which hehas published or prepared for publication—and has such awealth of interesting information at his disposal that a critical analysis of his methods may be not only of theoreti-cal, but also of immediate practical use. 
 We have alreadyquoted the author where he says that he has “carefullystudied the data on each industrial establishment in par-ticular ”. 
 It follows that a summary of the material, if only by the factory groups used even by our official statistics (up to 20 workers, 21-50, 51-100, 101-500, 501-1,000, and over1,000), was perfectly possible. 
 Was it necessary? Undoubtedly. 
 Statistics should not give arbitrary col-umns of figures but should, by means of figures, throw light on those different social types of the phenomenon under study that have fully emerged, or are emerging, inreality. 
 Can there be any doubt that establishments employ-ing 50 and those employing 500 workers belong to essentiallydifferent social types of the phenomenon we are interested in, or that the entire social development of all the civ-ilised countries increases the difference between these types and leads to one of them superseding the other? Let us take the data on the working day. 
 From the au-thor’s summary table of totals it can be concluded—providedwe ourselves do a certain amount of necessary statistical work which we do not see in the book—that 33,000 workers (out of the 220,000 surveyed) work longer than 10 hours a day. 
 The average duration of the working day of the 220,000 workers is 9 2 hours. 
 The question arises: are not these workers, crushed by an excessive working day, employed insmall establishments? This question arises naturally and necessarily. 
 It is by no means arbitrary. 
 The political economy and statistics of all countries of the world oblige us to put precisely this question, for the prolongation of working hours by smallestablishments has been registered only too often. 
 Capital-ist economic conditions necessitate this prolongation in thecase of small employers. 
 It turns out that the material at the author’s disposal did contain data for answering this highly important question, but they have disappeared in his summary! In his summa-ry, the author gives us very long and worthless columns ofdetailed “averages” but does not give the necessary division of factories according to the number of workers. 
 In the case of Moscow Gubernia, such a division is even more necessary (if we may here use the comparative degree)than elsewhere, for in Moscow Gubernia we see a compara-tively large number of small establishments alongside ahuge concentration of production. 
 According to statisticsfor 1910, there were altogether 1,440 establishments in the gubernia, employing 335,190 workers. 
 One-half of this number of workers (i. 
e. 
, 167,199) was concentrated in 66 fac-tories , while at the other pole there were 669 establishments employing a total of 18,277 workers. 
 It is clear that we have here entirely different social types and that statistics which do not distinguish between them are no good at all. 
 The author was so absorbed in his columns of figures on the numbers of workers who work 94, 95, etc. 
, to 144,hours in two successive weeks, that he left out altogether data on the number of establishments. 
 The number is given in the second part of his work, which deals with the length of the working year; but the first part, which deals with theworking day, gives no information on the number of estab-lishments, although this information was no doubt availableto the author. 
 The largest factories in Moscow Gubernia represent not only distinctive types of industrial establishment, but also distinctive types of population, with specific living and cul-tural (or rather cultureless) conditions. 
 The singling out ofthese factories, and a detailed analysis of the data for eachclass of establishment, according to the number of workers,are a necessary condition for rational economic statistics. 
 Let us cite the more important totals from Mr. 
 Kozminykh-Lanin’s work. 
 As we have said, his survey of the length of the working day covers 219,669 factory workers of Moscow Gubernia, or 71. 
37 per cent of their total number, the textile workersbeing represented in his statistics more widely than workersengaged in other industries. 
 The survey covered 74. 
6 percent of all the textile workers and only 49-71 per cent ofthe other workers. 
 Apparently , the survey was less extensive with regard to small establishments; in any case, the data on the number of working days in the year cover 58 per centof the establishments (811 out of the 1,394 existing in 1908)and 75 per cent of the workers (231,130 out of 307,773). 
 Itis plainly the smaller establishments that have been leftout. 
 The author gives summary data on the length of the work-ing day only for all the workers put together. 
 The re-sult is an average of 9 2 hours a day for adults and 7 2 hours for juveniles. 
 The number of juveniles, it should be noted, is not great: 1,363 against 218,306 adults. 
 This suggests that juvenile workers in particular may have been “hidden” from the inspectors. 
 Out of the total of 219,669 workers there were 128,628 (58. 
56 per cent) working in one shift, 88,552 (40. 
31 per cent)working in two shifts and 2,489 (1. 
13 per cent) working inthree shifts. 
 Two-shift work predominates over one-shift work in the textile industry, where there are 75,391 working in two shifts (“in production”, i. 
e. 
, exclusive of auxiliary workers)against 68,604 working in one shift. 
 The addition of repairand auxiliary workers produces a total of 78,107 workingin two shifts and 78,321 working in one shift. 
 In the caseof metalworkers, on the other hand, one-shift work pre-dominates considerably (17,821 adult workers) over two-shift work (7,673). 
 Summing up the total of workers who work different num-bers of hours a day, we obtain the following data: Number of hours worked per day Number of workers Up to 8 hours .......

 219,669 This shows how negligible still is the number of workers in Russia who do not work more than 8 hours a day—a mere4,398 out of 219,669. 
 On the other hand, the number ofworkers whose working day is excessively, scandalouslylong is very great: 33,466 out of 220,000, or over 15 per cent, work more than 10 hours a day ! And this without considering overtime work. 
 To proceed. 
 The difference in the length of the working day of one-shift and two-shift workers can be seen from thefollowing data, which refer only to adult “production work-ers”, i. 
e. 
, exclusive of repair and auxiliary workers, who make up 8 per cent of the total.

0 This shows, among other things, that 17 per cent of the two-shift workers work more than 9 hours a day, or more than is permitted even by the law of 1897, which Mr. 
 Lanin just-ly regards as exceedingly outdated. 
 Under this law, when work is carried on in two shifts, the number of hours worked perday must not exceed nine, calculated over a fortnight. 
 AndMr. 
 Lanin in all his calculations and tables takes pre-cisely a period of “two successive weeks”. 
 Since a very definite and precise law is violated so openly, it is easy to imagine the fate of the other provisions of our factory legislation. 
 The average number of hours worked per day by a one-shift worker (only adult and only engaged in “production”)is 9. 
89. 
 This implies prevalence of a ten-hour day without any reduction even on Saturdays, and exclusive of overtime work. 
 Needless to say such a long working day is cer-tainly excessive and cannot be tolerated. 
 The average number of hours worked per day by a two-shift worker is 8. 
97, i. 
e. 
, there predominates in practicethe nine-hour day which the law requires in this case. 
 Itsreduction to eight hours is particularly imperative because in the case of two-shift work the time from 10 p. 
m. 
 to 4 (!!) a. 
m. 
 is considered “night”, which means that in effect avery substantial portion of the night is considered to be “day” for the worker. 
 A nine-hour day with night turned into day, and with constant night work—that is the situation pre-vailing in Moscow Gubernia! In conclusion of our review of Mr. 
 Kozminykh-Lanin’s data, we wish to point out that he finds the average durationof the working year to be 270 days. 
 For textile workers, however, the figure is somewhat smaller—268. 
8 days—and for metalworkers, a little greater—272. 
3. 
 The way in which Kozminykh-Lanin has analysed these data on the length of the working year is also most unsatis-factory. 
 On the one hand, excessive, utterly senseless detail-ing: we find as many as 130 horizontal rows in the overalltable on the length of the working year! Data on the numbersof establishments, workers, etc. 
, are given here separately for each number of working days (per year) that occurs, beginning with 22 and ending with 366. 
 Such “detailing”is more like complete failure to “digest” the raw material. 
 On the other hand, here too we do not find the necessary summaries either on the numbers of workers in the factoriesor on the difference in motive power (manual and mechanical factories). 
 Hence one cannot obtain a picture enabling one to understand how various conditions affect the length of the working year. 
 The wealth of data collected by the authorhas gone to waste through very bad handling. 
 We can ascertain—roughly and far from accurately—the significance of the distinction between large-scale and small-scale production even from the author’s data, provided we re-analyse them somewhat. 
 Let us take the four main groups of establishments according to length of the working year:(1) those working up to 200 days a year; (2) from 200 to 250;(3) from 250 to 270, and (4) 270 days or longer. 
 By summing up, for each of these categories, the number of factories and that of the workers of both sexes, we obtain the following picture: Average number ofAverage Length of workingworkingNumber of number of yeardays perfactories workers workers yearper factory Up to 200 days ....

. 
 270 811 231,130 285 This shows clearly that the larger the factory, the longer (on the whole) the working year. 
 Consequently, the social and economic importance of small undertakings is much less in reality than appears from their share in, say, the total number of workers. 
 The working year in these undertakings is so much shorter than in the large ones that their share in production must be quite insignificant. 
 Besides, with a shortworking year, these factories (the small ones) are incapableof forming a permanent body of proletarians, hence theworkers here are more “bound” to the land, probably earnless, are less cultured, etc. 
 A large factory intensifies exploitation by prolonging the working year to the utmost and thus bringing into existencea proletariat which has completely severed its ties with thecountryside. 
 If we were to study the differences in length of the working year depending on the technical organisation of factories (manual and mechanical motive power, etc. 
), we could undoubtedly derive a whole series of highly interesting indi-cations of the living conditions of the population, the posi-tion of the workers, the evolution of our capitalism, etc. 
But the author, one can say, has not so much as touched onthese questions. 
 All he has done is to give figures on the average duration of the working year in factories of the different groupsof industries. 
 The variations of the general average arevery small from 246 days in Group IX (processing of mineralsubstances) to 291 in Group XII (chemical industry). 
 These differences, as the reader will see, are far less than those in the duration of the working year in small and large factories in general, irrespective of the industry to whichthey belong. 
 Differences in the type of industry are less characteristic, and less important for social and economic statistics thandifferences in the scale of production. 
 This does not mean, of course, that the former differences can be ignored. 
 What it does mean is that sensible statistics are absolutely impos-sible unless the latter differences are taken into account.

 IN BRITAIN The British Liberals have been in power for six and a half years. 
 The working-class movement in Britain is becom-ing stronger and stronger. 
 Strikes are assuming a mass character; moreover, they are ceasing to be purely economic and are developing into political strikes. 
 Robert Smillie, the leader of the Scottish miners who re-cently showed such strength in mass struggle 122 declares that in their next big fight the miners will demand the trans-fer of the collieries to state ownership. 
 And this next big fight is approaching inexorably, because all the miners of Britain are perfectly well aware that the notorious MinimumWage Act cannot bring about any appreciable improvementin their conditions. 
 And so the British Liberals, who are losing ground, have invented a new battle-cry in order once again to induce the mass of the electors to trust the Liberals for a while. 
 “You can’t sell without cheating” is the commercial sloganof capitalism. 
 “You can’t get seats in parliament withoutcheating is the slogan of capitalist politics in free coun-tries. 
 The “fashionable” slogan invented by the Liberals for this purpose is the demand for “land reform”. 
 It is not clear what the Liberals and their expert in humbugging the masses,Lloyd George, mean by that. 
 Apparently, it is a questionof increasing the land tax, and no more. 
 But the idea thatactually lies behind the resounding talk about “restoring theland to the people”, etc. 
, is to collect further millions for military adventures, for the Navy. 
 In Britain, agriculture is conducted wholly on capital-ist lines. 
 The capitalist farmers rent medium-sized plots of land from the landlords and cultivate them with the aid of wage-workers. 
 Under these circumstances, no “land reform” can in any way change the conditions of the agricultural workers. 
 InBritain the buying-out of landed estates might even becomea new method of fleecing the proletariat, since the landlordsand the capitalists, who would retain state power, wouldsell their land at exorbitant prices. 
 And the price would have to be paid by the taxpayers, i. 
e. 
, the workers again. 
 The fuss made by the Liberals about the land question has done good in one respect: it has roused interest in or-ganising the agricultural workers. 
 When Britain’s agricultural workers wake up and join together in unions, the Liberals will no longer be able to get away with charlatan “promises of reform” or of allotments for farm-hands and day-labourers. 
 Recently a reporter of a British labour newspaper visit-ed Joseph Arch, the veteran agricultural workers’ leader whohas done much to rouse the labourers to a class-consciouslife. 
 This could not be done at one stroke, and Arch’s slo-gan—“three acres and a cow” for every agricultural worker— was a very naïve one. 
 The union he founded fell to pieces,but the cause he fought for is not dead and the organisationof the agricultural workers in Britain is once again becomingan immediate issue. 
 Arch is now 83 years old. 
 He lives in the same village and in the same house in which he was born. 
 He told his inter-viewer that the agricultural workers’ union had managed toraise wages to 15, 16 and 17 shillings a week. 
 And now thewages of agricultural workers in Britain have againdropped—in Norfolk, where Arch lives—to 12 or 13 shillingsa week.

 to the Pravda text CONCENTRATION OF PRODUCTION IN RUSSIA In Russia, as in all capitalist countries, concentration of production is going on, i. 
e. 
, its concentration to an evergreater extent in a small number of large and very large undertakings. 
 Under the capitalist system, every undertaking is entire-ly dependent on the market. 
 In view of this dependence,the larger the undertaking, the more cheaply it can sell itsproduct. 
 A big capitalist buys raw materials more cheaplyand expends them more economically; he uses better ma-chinery, etc. 
 Small proprietors, on the other hand, are ruined and go under. 
 Production becomes more and more concentrat-ed in the hands of a few millionaires. 
 Millionaires generallyincrease their power still more through joint-stock compa-nies, which put in their hands the capital of middle pro-prietors and “small fry”. 
 Here are data, for example, on the factory industry in Russia for 1910 compared with 1901: 123 Groups of establishments Number of Number of workers by number of workers establishments (thousands) 1901 1910 1901 1910 Up to 50 ......... 2,740 9,909 244 220 51 to 100 ....

. 
 18,10215,080 1,702 1,903 Such is generally the situation in all capitalist countries. 
 The number of small establishments is decreasing ; the petty bourgeoisie, the small proprietors, are ruined and go under; they join the ranks of office employees, and sometimes of the proletariat. 
 The number of very large undertakings is growing fast, their share in production as a whole increasing still more. 
 From 1901 to 1910 the number of large factories employ-ing over 1,000 workers each increased almost 50 per cent—from 243 to 324. 
 In 1901 they had about half a million (526,000) workers, or less than one-third of the total number, whereas in 1910 the figure exceeded 700 ,000, which is more than one-third of the total. 
 The bigger factories choke the small ones and concentrate production more and more. 
 Ever greater numbers of workersare brought together in a few undertakings, but the whole profit from the labour of the combined millions of workers goes to a handful of millionaires.

 S. 
 Suvorin, the pub-lisher of Novoye Vremya , who died not long ago, reflected and expressed a very interesting period in the history of Russia’s bourgeois society as a whole. 
 At the start of his career he was a poor man, a liberal and even a democrat; towards the end of his career, he was a mil-lionaire, a self-satisfied and brazen extoller of the bour-geoisie, who grovelled before every turn in the policies of the powers that be. 
 Is this not typical of the bulk of the “educat-ed” and “intellectual” members of so-called society? It istrue, of course, that not all practise renegacy with suchfurious success as to become millionaires, but nine-tenthsor perhaps ninety-nine out of a hundred, practise the verysame renegacy, beginning as radical students and ending u p as holders of “cushy jobs” in some office or other, in some swindle or other. 
 A penniless student who could not enter university for lack of money; a teacher in an uyezd school, who also heldthe office of secretary to the Marshal of the Nobility or gaveprivate lessons in the homes of aristocratic and wealthy serf-owners; a budding liberal and even democratic journal-ist sympathising with Belinsky and Chernyshevsky andhostile to reaction—this is how Suvorin began in the fifties and sixties of the last century. 
 The landlord Katkov, a liberal who sympathised with the British bourgeoisie and the British Constitution, turned during the first upsurge of the democratic movement in Russia (in the early sixties of the nineteenth century) tonationalism, chauvinism and rabid Black-Hundredism. 
 The liberal journalist Suvorin turned during the second upsurge of the democratic movement in Russia (in the late seventies of the nineteenth century) to nationalism, to chau-vinism, to shameless fawning upon the powers that be. 
The Russo-Turkish War helped this careerist to “find him-self”, and to find his path of a flunkey rewarded by the hugeprofits of his newspaper At Your Service , Sir. 
 Suvorin’s Novoye Vremya earned that nickname, At Your Service , Sir, for many decades to come. 
 The newspaper became in Russia model example of the venal press. 
 Novoye Vremya became an expression synonymous with the concepts of apostasy, renegacy and sycophancy. 
 Suvorin’s Novoye Vremya is a specimen of brisk trade, of how to sell stuff “for consumption off or on the premises”. 
 It deals in everything, from political convictions to pornographic advertisements. 
 And now, after the third upsurge of the democratic move-ment in Russia (in the early twentieth century), how manymore liberals have taken the Vekhi path, turning to national-ism, to chauvinism, to the defamation of democracy, to sycophancy to the reaction! Katkov—Suvorin—the Vekhi group are all historical stages of the turn taken by the Russian liberal bourgeoisiefrom democracy to the defence of reaction, to chauvinism and anti-Semitism. 
 The class-conscious workers become steeled in their con-victions, realising the inevitability of this turn of the bour-geoisie, as well as of the turn of the working masses to theideas of working-class democracy.

 In my quality of representative of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 in the International Socialist Bureau, I must emphatically pro-test against the notice for the following reasons: 1. 
 The Executive of the S. 
D. 
P. 
 and L. 
 declares that the Warsaw Committee “is not affiliated to the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
,of which the S. 
D. 
P. 
 and L. 
 is an autonomous section”. 
 But the Executive of the S. 
D. 
P. 
 and L. 
 has no authority whatsoever either to decide or to declare who is affiliated to the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
, which I represent. 
 Today the Executive of the S. 
D. 
P. 
 and L. 
 itself is not affiliated to our Party, for it maintains no organisationalrelations either with the Central Committee I represent,which was elected at the Conference in January 1912, orwith the opposed liquidationist centre (the so-called “Organising Committee”). 
 2. 
 The assertion of the Executive of the S. 
D. 
P. 
 and L. 
 that the split occurred “unexpectedly just before the Dumaelections” is not in accord with the facts. 
 I happen to know that the very same Executive of the S. 
D. 
P. 
 and L. 
 must have foreseen a split as early as two years ago, when it provoked a sharp conflict with its former members, Malecki and Hanecki, and removed Haneckifrom the Board. 
 3. 
 It is hypocritical of the Executive to declare: firstly, that agents provocateurs have made their way into the Warsaw organisation “as into all the other revolu-tionary organisations in tsarist Russia”; secondly, that the split came about with “the active co-operation of the secret police”, although the Executivecannot give a single name, and does not dare to express anyspecific suspicion! How very hypocritical one has to be to make in public the dishonest accusation of “co-operation of the secretpolice”, with the aim of morally destroying one’s politicalopponents, even while lacking the courage to give a singlename or express any specific suspicion! I am confident that every member of the International will indignantly reject these unheard-of methods of struggle. 
 I have for a number of years known the two former mem-bers of the Executive of the S. 
D. 
P. 
 and L. 
, Malecki andHanecki, who openly march shoulder to shoulder with theWarsaw Committee. 
 I have received, precisely from theWarsaw Committee, an official notification confirming this fact. 
 In the present situation, I consider it my duty to convey to the International Socialist Bureau the enclosed protestfrom the Warsaw Committee of the S. 
D. 
P. 
 and L. 
 As the statement of the Executive Committee has been circulated to all members of the International Socialist Bureau, I must ask you, dear comrade, to circulate also this statement of mine, together with the protest of theWarsaw Committee, to the representatives of all the partiesaffiliated to the International.

 19, November 21, 1912 to the newspaper text Translated from the Polish THE CADETS AND THE AGRARIAN QUESTION In their polemics against Pravda , the Cadets were unable, much as they tried, to evade the question whether theyare a democratic or a liberal-monarchist party. 
 This is a highly important question. 
 Its importance goes beyond that of a general question of principle which provides material for elucidating basic political concepts. 
 Moreover,the question of the nature of the Cadet Party, which claimsleadership of the entire opposition, is inseparably boundup with all the fundamental questions of the Russian eman-cipation movement in general. 
 That is why anyone who takes an intelligent interest in the election campaign, and appreciates its significance for the political enlightenmentof the masses, is bound to pay the greatest attention to thiscontroversy on the nature of the Cadet Party. 
 The Cadet Rech is now trying to stifle this controversy, to shut out questions of principle by subterfuges and quar-relsome sallies (“a lie”, “a distortion”, etc. 
), to rake up some abuse or other which the liquidators flung at us whentheir personal annoyance, caused by sharp organisationalconflicts, was at its highest. 
 All these are familiar and bat-tered methods used by people who realise their weakness ina controversy over principles. 
 And for this reason our reply to the Cadets must be a repeated explanation of questions of principle. 
 What are the distinctions between democracy and liber-alism in general? Both the bourgeois democrat and the lib-eral (all liberals are bourgeois liberals, but not every dem-ocrat is a bourgeois democrat) are opposed to the old order, to absolutism, serfdom, the privileges of the upper social-estate, etc; they are for political liberty and a constitutional“legal” system. 
 That is the resemblance between them. 
 Now for the difference between them. 
 The democrat represents the mass of the population. 
 He shares their petty-bourgeois prejudices, expecting, for example, that a new, “equalised” redivision of all the land would not only abol-ish all vestiges of serfdom (he would be justified in expectingthis), but would also undermine the foundations of capital-ism (which is entirely unjustified, for no redivision of the land can do away either with the power of the market and of money, or with the power and omnipotence of capital). 
 But the democrat believes in the movement of the masses,in its strength and justice, and has no fear at all of this move-ment. 
 He advocates the abolition of all medieval privileges without exception. 
 The liberal does not represent the mass of the population but a minority of the latter, namely, the big and middle liberal bourgeoisie. 
 The liberal is more afraid of the move-ment of the masses and of consistent democracy than ofreaction. 
 Far from seeking complete abolition of all medievalprivileges, he frankly defends some privileges which are, moreover, very substantial ones, and strives to ensure that these privileges are divided between the Purishkeviches and the Milyukovs and not abolished altogether. 
 The liberal defends political liberty and the constitu-tion—invariably in a curtailed form (such as the two-cham-ber system and many other things), each curtailment amount-ing to the preservation of a privilege of the serf-owners. 
 Thus the liberal vacillates continuously between the serf-owners and the democrats; hence the extreme, almost in-credible impotence of the liberals in all matters of any impor-tance. 
 Russia’s democrats are the working class (proletarian democrats) and the Narodniks and Trudoviks of all shades (bourgeois democrats). 
 Russia’s liberals are the Cadet Party, as well as the “Progressists” and most of the non-Russiangroups in the Third Duma. 
 Russian democrats have important victories to their credit, Russian liberals none at all. 
 The former have provedtheir ability to fight, and their defeats have always been great, historic defeats of the whole of Russia; moreover, even after a defeat some of the democrats’ demands have invari-ably been met. 
 The latter, i. 
e. 
, the liberals, have proved incapable of fighting, and they have nothing to show in Russian history but a constant contemptuous treatment of the liberals by the serf-owners, comparable to the treatment of the serfs by their lords. 
 Let us test these general considerations and basic theo-retical postulates by the Cadets’ agrarian programme. 
Pravda told the Cadets that their undemocratic nature was evident from the speeches on the agrarian question made by the Cadet Berezovsky the Second in the Third Duma. 
 * The Cadet Rech answered, in its issue No. 
 208: “The speech of Berezovsky the Second was, as we know, a reaffir-mation of the Cadet agrarian programme. 
” See how evasive this answer is! We said that the speech of Berezovsky the First ** was a specimen of undemocratic treatment of the question. 
 Rech knows very well what we consider an indication of liberalism as distinct from democ-racy. 
 But it has no intention of analysing the questionseriously, of stating which precisely are the signs of thedistinction between liberalism and democracy that it, i. 
e. 
,Rech , considers correct, and of ascertaining whether these signs are evident in the speech of Berezovsky the First. 
 Rech does nothing of the kind. 
 It dodges the issue, thus betraying a fundamental weakness and a guilty conscience. 
 But even Rech could not bring itself to disclaim the responsibility of the entire Cadet Party for the speech de-livered by Berezovsky the First. 
 It admitted—it had to admit—this responsibility by describing the speech as a “reaffirmation of the Cadet agrarian programme”. 
 Splendid. 
 And now we shall quote the main passages from that indisputably and officially Cadet speech by amember of the Third Duma, the Simbirsk landlord A. 
 Y. 
Berezovsky. 
 We shall see, in analysing the speaker’s argu-ments, whether his point of view is democratic or liberal. 
 And we shall also see whether the Cadet gentlemen succeedin refuting us in their vast press or at their meetings.

 **Both Pravda and Rech were mistaken in speaking of Berezov-sky the Second. 
 The Cadet is Berezovsky the First , Alexander Yelea-zarovich, a Simbirsk landlord. 
 “It is my deep conviction,” said A. 
 Y. 
 Berezovsky in the Third Duma in October 1908 (we are quoting from the verbatim reportpublished in Rossiya 124), “that this Bill [the Cadets’ land Bill] is far more beneficial to the landowners as well [and not to the peas-ants alone], and I say this, gentlemen, because I am familiar with agriculture, having engaged in it all my life and being a landownermyself. 
 For a cultured farming system, the Bill of the party of people’sfreedom would undoubtedly be more useful than the present system. 
One should not seize on the bare fact of compulsory alienation, be-come indignant about it, and say that it is violence, but should see and appreciate what the things proposed in our Bill will amount to and how this compulsory alienation is to be effected .... 
” We have emphasised these truly precious words of Mr. 
 A. 
 Y. 
 Berezovsky’s—precious because of their rareveracity. 
 Anyone who recalls the speeches and articles of the Marxist Bolsheviks against the Cadets at the time of the First Duma, or who takes the trouble to read those articlesnow, will have to agree that in 1908 Mr. 
 A. 
 Y. 
 Berezovskybrilliantly confirmed the Bolsheviks of 1906. 
 And we ven-ture to predict that any history that is at all impartial willconfirm their policy three times over. 
 In 1906 we said: “Don’t trust the sound of that phrase— compulsory alienation’. 
” The point is, who will compel whom . 
 If the landlords compel the peasants to pay for poor lands three times their worth, in the fashion of the noto-rious compensation of 1861, then this kind of “compulsoryalienation” will be a landlord reform beneficial to the landlords and ruinous to the peasants. 
 * The liberals, the Cadets, in raising the question of com-pulsory alienation, manoeuvred between the landlords and the peasants, between the Black Hundreds and the demo-crats. 
 In 1906, they addressed themselves to the democrats,trying to make their “compulsory alienation” pass for something democratic. 
 In 1908, they addressed themselves to the diehards in the Third Duma, arguing that one shouldsee “what this compulsory alienation will amount to andhow it is to be effected”. 
 Let us listen then to the official spokesman of the Cadet Party. 
 *See present edition, Vol. 
 10, pp.

 “Take the Bill of the forty-two members of the First State Duma,” said A. 
 Y. 
 Berezovsky. 
 “It contained only [exactly, Mr. 
 Berezovsky!]the recognition of the necessity of alienating first of all those landswhich are not exploited by their owners themselves. 
 Furthermore the party of people’s freedom favoured the establishment of local committees which would have to ascertain at a certain time whichlands are or are not subject to alienation and how much land thepeasants require to meet their needs. 
 The committees were to beconstituted in such a manner as to ensure that half of the memberswere peasants and the other half non-peasants. 
” Mr. 
 A. 
 Y. 
 Berezovsky omitted a trifle from his statement. 
 Anyone who wishes to look into the agrarian Bill preparedby Kutler (the Cadet Party’s recognised authority on theagrarian question) and published in Volume II of the Cadetpublication, The Agrarian Question , will see that, by the terms of the Bill, the chairmen of the committees were to be appointed by the government, i. 
e. 
, they too were to berepresentatives of the landlords. 
 But let us assume even that A. 
 Y. 
 Berezovsky expressed the Cadet views more accurately than Kutler. 
 Let us assumethat A. 
 Y. 
 Berezovsky said everything and that the Cadets actually want committees made up of equal numbers o f peasants and “non-peasants”, without representatives ofthe class government. 
 What then? Will anyone dare to as-sert that such a Bill is democratic? Democracy is the rule of the majority. 
 Only universal, direct and equal elections can be called democratic. 
 Only such committees are democratic as have been elected by the entire population on the basis of universal suffrage. 
 This follows from the general, basic, elementary truths ofdemocracy so indisputably that it even seems strange to haveto explain it to the Cadet gentlemen. 
 On paper, the Cadets recognise universal suffrage. 
 But in reality , with regard to one of the most important ques-tions of the Russian emancipation movement, the agrarianquestion, they do not recognise universal suffrage! No sub-terfuges or reservations remove this fact, which is of primeimportance. 
 And do not imagine that the Cadets merely depart here from the principle of universal suffrage, from the principle of democracy. 
 No. 
 They take as a basis a different principle, the principle of “ agreement ” between the old and the new, between the landlord and the peasant, between the Black Hundreds and the democrats. 
 What the Cadets proclaim is: half to one side and half to the other. 
 This is a typical principle of the vacillating liberal-monarchist bourgeoisie. 
 What this bourgeoisie wants is notthe abolition of medieval privileges, but their division be-tween the landlords and the bourgeoisie. 
 Indeed, how cananyone deny that to grant the “non-peasants” (i. 
e. 
, the land-lords, to put it bluntly) equality with the peasants, who make up seven-tenths of the population, means preserving and reaffirming medieval privileges? What else did medieval privileges amount to but that the landlord meant as muchin politics as hundreds and thousands of peasants? From equality of the landlords and the peasants there can be no other outcome but a division of privileges between the landlords and the bourgeoisie. 
 That was precisely thecase in 1861, when the landlords ceded one-thousandth oftheir privileges to the nascent bourgeoisie, while the peas-ant masses were doomed to half a century (1861 $50 =1911) of the agony of disfranchisement, humiliation, slow starva-tion, extortion of taxes, etc. 
 Besides, it should not be for-gotten that in 1861 the landlords, ceding one-thousandthof their political privileges to the bourgeoisie (the Zemstvo,urban and judicial reforms, etc. 
), began themselves todevelop economically into a bourgeoisie by setting up distil-leries and sugar refineries, joining the boards of joint-stock companies, and so on. 
 We shall see in a moment the final outcome of this “equal-ity” of a negligible number of landlords and a huge numberof peasants, as pointed out by Mr. 
 A. 
 Y. 
 Berezovsky himself. 
But first we must stress the great significance of Berezov-sky’s statement that the vaunted committees would have to “ascertain which lands are or are not subject to alienation and how much land the peasants require to meet their needs”. 
 All the talk about various “norms” of allotment for the peasants, etc. 
, is nothing but empty words with which, in-cidentally, our Narodnik intellectuals, including the most“Left” of them, often lull themselves and the peasants. 
 The only important question is: will all the lands be subject to alienation or not? And, in the latter case, who is to decide “which are not subject ”? (I do not speak of who is to deter- /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR mine the amount of the compensation, for the very idea of compensation for medieval privileges is a liberal-bourgeois principle, one that is radically, at bottom, absolutely un-democratic and anti-democratic). 
 All the clauses of the Cadets’ land Bills—clauses which have been drafted in detail and bureaucratically polished—are a useless bureaucratic undertaking. 
 The only impor-tant question is: who is to determine which lands are to be alienated and on what terms ? The most ideal Bill is no more than chicanery if it evades this question. 
 But how does Mr. 
 Berezovsky decide this sole important question? For it should be clear that, given equality ofthe peasants and “non-peasants”, there will be no agree-ment in most cases, nor, indeed, is it necessary to draft Bills for an amicable settlement between the serf-owners and the serfs of yesterday. 
 The serf-owners are alwaysagreeable to an “ amicable settlement” with them, even without any laws. 
 And Mr. 
 Berezovsky gave a clear answer to the burning question, in speaking to the Third Duma diehards. 
 Listen to what he said next: “In view of this, that general concrete work on the spot would, of course, bring to light both the amount of land ‘ available ’ [listen to this!] for alienation and the amount of land required for the peas-ants [required for what? Would it be for performing services? But that is something the serf-owners have always agreed to!], and finally,the peasants themselves would see to what extent it was possible to meet their fair [ahem! God save us from lordly anger, lordly love and the landlord’s “fairness”] demands. 
 Then it would all go throughthe Duma and [mark this well!] the Council of State and, after being recast [ahem!], would be sanctioned in final form [i. 
e. 
, made law]. 
 This methodical work [it certainly could not be more “methodical”!]would no doubt result in really meeting the true needs of the popu-lation and thereby in pacifying and preserving the cultural farms, which the party of people ’s freedom has never wanted to demolish un-less strictly necessary . 
” This was said by a spokesman of the “party of people’s freedom”, which it would be fair to call the party of landlordpacification. 
 It is perfectly clear from this that the “compulsory alie-nation” proposed by the Cadets implies compulsion of the peasants by the landlords . 
 Whoever sets out to deny this must prove that in the Council of State the peasants predomi-nate over the landlords! “Equality” of the landlords and the peasants to begin with, and in the end—unless an amicable settlement is reached—a “ recasting ” of the draft by the Coun-cil of State. 
 “The party of people’s freedom has never wanted to demol-ish the cultural farms unless strictly necessary,” said thelandlord A. 
 Y. 
 Berezovsky, who probably considers his farm“cultural”. 
 But we will ask: who is to decide whose farm is “cultural” and in what sense, and where does “strict necessi-ty” begin? Answer: this will be decided, first by a committeemade up of equal numbers of landlords and peasants, and then by the Council of State. 
 Well then? Are the Cadets a democratic party or a counter-revolutionary party of the liberal-monarchist bourgeoisie? Are they a party of “people’s freedom” or of landlord pacifi-cation? Russia’s bourgeois democrats, i. 
e. 
, the Trudoviks and Na-rodniks of all shades, have grievously erred in expecting thetransfer of the landed estates to the peasants to bring about“equalisation”, the spread of “labour principles”, and so on; they have also erred by obscuring, with empty talk about various “standards” of landownership, the question whetherthere is to be medieval land tenure or not, but these democratshave helped the new to force out the old and have not draftedBills to enable the old to retain a number of privileges. 
 Really, to deny that the Cadets are not a democratic party but a party of the counter-revolutionary, liberal-monarch-ist bourgeoisie, means simply flying in the face of well-known facts. 
 In conclusion we shall briefly examine a question which might well be asked by certain naïve Cadets. 
 If the “com-pulsory alienation” suggested by the Cadets implied compulsion of the peasants by the landlords, why did themajority of the landlords reject it? This question was answered unintentionally by Mr. 
 Mi-lyukov, in his speech in the Third Duma on October 31, 1908,when he spoke as a historian . 
 Milyukov the historian had to admit that until the end of 1905 both the government and the landlords had regarded the peasantry as a conservative force . 
 At the Peterhof meeting on July 19-26, 1905—that meeting paved the way for the Bulygin Duma125—A. 
 A. 
 Bobrinsky, Naryshkin and other pillars of the future Coun-cil of the United Nobility were in favour of giving the peas-ants a predominant position in the Duma . 
 At that time Witte held that the mainstay of the autocracy should be(and could be) the “peasant democrats”, not the nobility or the bourgeoisie. 
 * “Gentlemen,” said Mr. 
 Milyukov, “this is an interesting moment because it is at this moment that the government has conceived the idea of compulsory alienation. 
 ( Voices : “It’s Kutler’s idea. 
”) Yes, Kutler’s, gentlemen .... 
 Kutler is drafting a Bill on compulsory alienation .... 
 “He has been working on it, gentlemen; his work continued for a month or two —I cannot say exactly— until the end of 1905 . 
 It went on unhampered until the well-known Moscow events took place, after which there was a noticeable change in sentiment. 
” On January 4, 1906, the Marshals of the Nobility met in congress. 
 The congress rejected Kutler’s draft, which it knew from hearsay and private reports. 
 It adopted an agrarianprogramme of its own (the future “Stolypin” programme),In February 1906 Minister Kutler resigned. 
 On March 30,1906, the Witte Cabinet (with its “peasant” programme)was succeeded by the Gurko-Goremykin Cabinet (with its “Stolypin” programme, a programme of the nobility and the bourgeoisie). 
 These are the facts which Milyukov the historian had to admit. 
 The inference from them is obvious. 
 The “Cadet” Bill on compulsory alienation was a Bill prepared by Kutler, Minister in the Witte Cabinet, who dreamed of an autocracy supported by the peasantry! When the peasants’ democraticmovement was on the rise, attempts were made to bribe themovement, to corrupt it, to deceive it with a Bill for “peace-ful”, “compulsory alienation”, a “second emancipation”, aBill for a bureaucratic “compulsion of the peasants by the landlords”. 
 *See Report of the People ’s Freedom Group on the Second Session of the Third Duma (St. 
 Petersburg, 1909), p. 
 43. 
 It is unfortunate— very unfortunate—that the Cadets did not publish Berezovsky’s speech. 
 This is what the facts of history tell us. 
 The Cadets’ agrarian Bill is a Witte Minister’s plan for “playing” at peasant Caesarism. 
 The peasant democrats did not live up to expectations. 
 They showed—probably more clearly in the First Duma thanin 1905—that since 1861 they had become politically con-scious . 
 With a peasantry such as this , the Kutler-Cadet Bill became an absurdity: the peasants, far from letting themselves be hoodwinked in the old fashion, would have used even the Cadets’ local land committees to organise a new onslaught. 
 On January 4, 1906, the Marshals of the Nobility correctly decided that the Bill prepared by the liberal landlords(Kutler and Co. 
) was a hopeless affair, and cast it aside. 
The civil war had outgrown liberal-bureaucratic scheme-making. 
 The class struggle had dispelled the vision of “social peace ” and raised the issue squarely: “either the Stolypin way or the Trudovik way”. 
 Nevskaya Zvezda No. 
 22, Published according August 19, 1912 to the text in Nevskaya Zvezda Signed: W. 
 Frey A POOR DEFENCE In “The Strike Movement and Wages”, an article pub-lished in Pravda No. 
 86 on August 9, * we cited official statistical data on the average wages of Russian factory workers in the first decade of the twentieth century. 
 It appeared that by their famous strike movement in 1905 the workers had raised their wages from 206 rubles (theannual average per worker) to 238 rubles, i. 
e. 
, by 32rubles, or 15. 
5 per cent. 
 Our conclusion did not please the official newspaper Ros-siya . 
 It devoted the leading article in its August 15 issue to a detailed restatement of the data cited by us (withholdingfor some reason the name of the newspaper from which ithad borrowed the data), and tried to refute our conclusions. 
 “It is true, of course, that wages rose abruptly in 1906,” wrote Rossiya . 
 “But it is just as true that the prices of all commodities and food rose simultaneously with them .... 
” And Rossiya went on to present its calculations, according to which wages have risen by 20 per cent, while the cost ofliving has gone up by 24 per cent. 
 Rossiya ’s calculations are inaccurate in every respect. 
 In reality the rise in wagesis not so large, while the rise in the cost of living is more considerable. 
 But we shall not now correct the mistakes of Rossiya . 
 Let us take its figures. 
 “They do not at all suggest that the workers have gained any-thing,” wrote Rossiya . 
 “Indeed, judging by their frequent complaints of hard times, one could rather draw the reverse conclusion, namely,that they have scarcely gained anything. 
” *See pp. 
 258-59 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 A strange way to reason, isn't it? If wages have risen to a lesser extent than prices of the prime necessities of life, it is necessary to raise wages to a still greater extent ! Surely this is obvious. 
 But how can the workers achieve a rise in wages without an economic struggle and without strikes? Has Rossiya ever seen capitalists offer the workers a pay rise of their own accord , in view of the rising prices of the prime necessities of life? Rossiya admits that wages rose abruptly in 1906—thanks to a widespread mass strike movement unprecedented in theworld for tenacity. 
 But food prices began to climb before 1905 . 
 The price of bread, for example, has never dropped in Russia since 1903 but has only risen. 
 The prices of live-stock products have never dropped since 1901 but have only risen. 
 It follows that solely by their strike movement did the workers ensure that wages, too, began to rise following the rise in the prices of bread and other foodstuffs. 
 Since thewage rise is inadequate, as is admitted even by Rossiya , it is necessary to raise wages further. 
 Pravda No. 
 96, August 21, 1912 Published according Signed: W. 
 to the Pravda text THE LIQUIDATOR S AND “UNIT Y”126 The seventh issue of Nevsky Golos , which appeared a few days ago, can only be described as hysterical. 
 Instead of a labour chronicle, nearly two pages of it contain choice abuse against Pravda and Nevskaya Zvezda . 
 Curiously enough, this abuse is offered under the slogan of “unity” of the working class, of “unity” in the election campaign. 
 Gentlemen—we shall reply to the liquidators—unity of the working class is a great principle. 
 But, really, youmake yourselves ridiculous if, while shouting about “unity”, you try to impose on the working class the platform and the candidates of a group of liberal liquidationist intellectuals. 
 Pravda has proved by means of accurate figures that “liq-uidationism is nothing in the working-class movement, andthat it is strong only among the liberal intelligentsia” ( Prav-da No. 
 80, August 1, 1912 *). 
 Nevsky Golos No. 
 7, of August 17, now reviles those articles of Pravda , calling them “feuilleton-like”, “Khlestakovian”, and so on. 
 And yet it doesnot even try to question the simple fact that in the courseof six months Pravda drew 504 contributions from groups of workers, while the liquidationist papers drew only 15. 
 What is the conclusion to be drawn from this but that all the shouting and noise and abuse and clamour about uni-ty are merely intended to cover up the extreme and totalimpotence of the liquidators within the working class? No matter how much Nevsky Golos may abuse us, we shall calmly point out the incontrovertible facts to the workers. 
Look at the collections listed in Nevsky Golos No. 
 7, and at those made in July and August “to replenish the funds *See pp. 
 196-200 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 of the newspaper” (i. 
e. 
, in plain language, to restore the liquidationist paper suspended for lack of support from the mass of the workers). 
 The report on those collections lists 52 contributions totalling 827. 
11 rubles. 
 Of these, onlytwo were group collections: one by “ the Moscow initiating group ”, amounting to 35 rubles, and the other by a “ group of friends in Paris ”—8. 
54 rubles. 
 Of the remaining 50 indi-vidual contributions, 35 added up to 708 rubles, i. 
e. 
, o ver 20 rubles per contribution on the average . 
 Nevsky Golos may fume and abuse—the facts will be no less true for that. 
 It is common knowledge that the “initiat-ing groups” are groups of liquidators who have broken away from the working-class party. 
 Even Plekhanov admittedthis openly and plainly as long ago as April 1912. 
 A group of break-away liquidators has resumed—with the donations of bourgeois liberal intellectuals—the pub-lication of its newspaper to fight the working-class press!And yet this group is shouting about “unity”. 
 Now how cananyone help laughing at that? Pravda No. 
 99, August 24, 1912 Published according to the Pravda text A TALK ON “CADET-EATING ” Pravda and Nevskaya Zvezda have administered a stern but well-deserved rebuttal to Messrs. 
 Blank, Korobka,Kuskova and Co. 
 for their foul liberal attacks against the working-class press. 
 Nevertheless, however good the answers given to “the gentlemen boycotting the workers” may have been, there isstill a most important question of principle to be examined. 
The Blanks and Kuskovas sought by their crude lies tohush it up, to obscure it. 
 But we must not allow questions of principle to be obscured; we must reveal their full sig-nificance, bringing to light the roots of the differences,which are of interest to every class-conscious worker, frombeneath the heap of Blank-Kuskova distortions, calumniesand abuse. 
 One of these roots may be described by the term “Cadet-eating”. 
 Listen to the solitary but persistent voices of the liquidators, to the remarks of people whose party views aresomewhat indefinite, and you will often encounter, if notan accusation against Pravda and Nevskaya Zvezda , at least head-shaking on account of their “Cadet-eating”. 
 Let us, therefore, examine the question of “Cadet-eating”, which is a question of principle. 
 There are two circumstances which explain first of all, and most of all, the occurrence of such an accusation againstPravda : (1) failure to understand the essence of the question of “two and three camps” in the election campaign and inpresent-day politics in general; (2) lack of consideration for the special conditions in which the Marxist press—the newspapers of the worker democrats—has now been placed. 
 Let us begin with the first question. 
 All the liberals adhere to the theory of two camps: for a constitution and against a constitution. 
 They are all agreed on this, from Milyukov to Izgoyev, and from Prokopovich to M. 
 M. 
 Kovalevsky. 
 Nor must we forget that the theoryof two camps necessarily follows from the class nature o f our liberals. 
 What is this nature from the economic point of view? It is the fact that the liberals are a party of the bourgeoi-sie, which is afraid of the movement of the peasant masses, and still more of the workers’ movement, for this movementis capable of limiting (at present, in the immediate future, without changing the capitalist system as a whole) the extentand forms of the bourgeoisie’s economic privileges. 
 And the economic privilege of the bourgeoisie is ownership of capital, an ownership which in Russia yields twice or three times as much profit as in Europe. 
 To uphold this “Russian” superprofit, it is necessary to prevent the third camp from gaining independence. 
 For example, the bourgeoisie can rule quite well even if the working day is eight hours. 
 In fact, its rule will then be fuller, purer, wider and freer than with a ten-or eleven-hour day. 
 But the dialectics of the class struggle are suchthat, unless there is an extreme need, unless it is the lastremedy, the bourgeoisie will never replace the tranquil,habitual, profitable (from an Oblomov 127 point of view) ten-hour day by an eight-hour one. 
 What we have said about an eight-hour day applies to the upper chamber, to landlordism and many otherthings. 
 The bourgeoisie will not relinquish the tranquil, con-venient, profitable, old-Russian forms of exploitation toreplace them only by European, only by democratic forms (for democracy, let it be said without offence to the ardent heroes of Zavety , is also a form of bourgeois rule); it will not do so, we say, unless there is an extreme need, and unless itis the last remedy. 
 This need can arise only from the movement of the masses achieving a certain system and strength. 
 And the bourgeoi-sie, which upholds its economic interests, is fighting against this movement, that is to say , against the independence of the third camp. 
 What is the class nature of liberalism from the political point of view? It is fear of the movement of these same so-cial elements, for that movement is capable of undermining political privileges which the bourgeoisie values. 
 Liberal-ism dreads democracy more than reaction. 
 This was provedin 1905, 1906 and 1907. 
 To retain any part of the political privileges, it is necessary to prevent the independence of the third camp, to keep all opposition in none but the position expressed by the formula “for or against a constitution”. 
 This formula expresses an exclusively constitutional position. 
 It does not go beyond constitutional reforms. 
 The essence of this formula was excellently and accuratelyexpressed by Mr. 
 Gredeskul—who inadvertently blurted out more than he had meant to—in those statements of his which Rech repeated without a single reservation and which Pravda reproduced not long ago. 
 * The essence of this formula is quite in the spirit of Vekhi , for Vekhi wants nothing better and has, in fact, never preached anything else. 
 Vekhi is not at all against a constitu-tion or constitutional reforms. 
 It is “ only ” against the demo-crats, with their criticism of any sort of constitutionalillusions. 
 The Russian liberals have proved to be sufficiently “adroit” politicians to call themselves “democratic” witha view to fighting the democrats and suppressing the latter’s independence. 
 Such is the usual and normal method used by every liberal bourgeoisie in all capitalist countries: deceiv-ing the masses with a democratic facade in order to deflect them from a truly democratic theory and truly democraticpractice. 
 But the experience of all countries, including Russia, has shown beyond question that only such practice is capable of ensuring real progress, whereas liberalism inevitablydooms itself to impotence by its fear of democracy, and itsVekhi -Gredeskul theories: the impotence of Russian liberal-ism in 1861-1904, and of German liberalism in 1849-1912. 
 The third camp, that of democracy, which understands the narrowness of liberalism and is free from its half-hearted-*See pp. 
 254-55 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 ness and flabbiness, from its vacillation and timid back-ward looks, cannot take shape, cannot exist, without system-atic, undeviating, day-by-day criticism of liberalism. 
 Those who scornfully or with ill-will dub this criticism “Cadet-eating” are thereby advocating precisely liberal views—deliberately or unwittingly. 
 For, in practice, all criti-cism of Cadetism is thereby , by its very presentation of ques-tions, a criticism of reaction, of the Rights. 
 Our polemic against the liberals, said Nevskaya Zvezda (No. 
 12) * very justly, “is more profound and richer in content than the fight against the Rights”. 
 ** In reality there is hardly one Marxist newspaper for every hundred liberal papers in Russia, so that it is simplyridiculous to talk about our “exaggerated” criticism of the Cadets: we are not yet doing even one-hundredth of what is necessary in order that the sentiment of “general opposi-tion” prevailing in society and among the people may bereplaced by an anti-liberal, definitely and consciously demo-cratic sentiment. 
 Without such a “replacement”, nothing sensible and use-ful has ever come about, or will come about in Russia. 
 Accusations of “Cadet-eating”, or scornful smiles at “Cadet-eating”, are no more than a façon de parler , a way of advocating liberal views, or the views of a liberal labourpolicy when there is a discussion before or about workers. 
 From the standpoint of liquidationism that is at all con-sistent and thought out, accusations of “Cadet-eating” are understandable and necessary . 
 They express the essence of liquidationism. 
 *See pp. 
 124-26 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 **Rech objects to this, saying: if that is so, why do the Rights sympathetically quote Pravda against Rech ? Rech makes an overstate-ment here: if the Rights were to give Pravda more freedom than to Rech , it would be a forcible argument against the Social-Democrats. 
 But everyone knows that the reverse is the case. 
 Our press has a hun-dred times less freedom than Rech ; it is a thousand times less firmly established and enjoys 10,000 times less “constitutional” protection. 
Any literate person realises that Rossiya and Novoye Vremya are teasing Rech with Pravda and that, moreover, they are strangling Pravda while merely grumbling at or chiding Rech . 
 These are two entirely different things. 
 Look at the liquidationist views as a whole—at their inner logic, at their interconnection and the interdependence of the various theses: “freedom of association” is a consti-tutional reform; economic strikes are supplemented with a“political revival ”, no more; a far-reaching election platform is declared to be “lunacy”; the task is formulated as one offighting for the open existence of the Party , i. 
e. 
, is also formulated as a constitutional reform; the regime in Rus-sia is declared to be bourgeois already (Larin); the commer-cial and industrial bourgeoisie is declared to be already aruling class; the workers are told that it is “sufficient” toseize on the contradiction between absolutism and consti-tutionalism (Martov). 
 Taken as a whole, this is reformism , it is the system of views of a liberal labour policy. 
 It makes no difference at all that some Ivan or Pyotr, in defending these views ( some part or other of them , for liquidationism is going through a “process of growth of growing tasks”), himself thinks he is a Marxist. 
 The point at issue is not their good intentions (of those who have any), but the objective significance of their policy, i. 
e. 
, what its results are, cui prodest —whom it benefits, to whose mill it actually brings grist. 
 This is defence of the workers’ interests on the basis pro-vided by the “struggle” (or is it bickering?) between theliberals and the Rights; it is not a struggle for a democratic, anti-liberal basis of sapping the strength of the Rights. 
 The liquidators are supporters of the workers, there is no doubtof that. 
 But they understand the interests of the workers in such a way that they uphold these interests within the frame-work of the Russia which the liberals promise to build, not of the Russia which the democrats were building yes-terday, and will be building tomorrow (and which they are invisibly building even today), in spite of the liberals. 
 That is the crux of the matter. 
 So far there is no new Russia. 
 It has yet to be built. 
 Should the workers buildthemselves a nest of a “class” (in effect a craft) nature inthe Russia of the kind which the Milyukovs are building in common with the Purishkeviches, or should the workers themselves , in their own way, build a new Russia entirely without the Purishkeviches and in spite of the Milyukovs? That new Russia will in any case be bourgeois, but there is quite a big difference between the bourgeois (agrarian and non-agrarian) policy of Stolypin and the bourgeois policy of Sun Yat-sen. 
 The chief feature of the present epoch in Russia is determination of the size of that difference. 
 “In spite of the Milyukovs”, we said. 
 It is this “in spite of” that is “Cadet-eating”. 
 That is why, being unafraid of words, we remain, and shall remain, “ Cadet-eaters ” as a matter of principle , without forgetting for one moment the special tasks of the working class, both against Milyukov and against Sun Yat-sen. 
 The accusation of “Cadet-eating” is merely a longing (whether conscious or unconscious, makes no difference) to see the workers, in building a new Russia, trail after the Milyukovs and not show the way to our own little Sun Yat-sens in spite of the Milyukovs. 
 It remains for us to say a few words about a second cir-cumstance, which those who talk about “Cadet-eating”overlook. 
 It is said: why cannot we develop our views constructive-ly? Why engage in excessive polemics ? Those who say that argue, as it were, in the following way: we are not againsta special line entirely different from the Cadet line, nor arewe against three camps; we are only against the “substitu-tion of polemics for politics”, to use the biting phrase of a friend of the liquidators. 
 It is easy to answer those who talk like that: in the first place, one cannot develop new views other than throughpolemics (and Marxist views are new, both as regards thetime of their emergence and the extent to which they havespread, in comparison with liberal views). 
 Secondly, the arena in which Nevskaya Zvezda a nd Pravda are operating, is an arena of purely theoretical Marxist propaganda. 
 It would be wrong to regard this arena as something more:it is only a theoretical ABC, a theoretical first step, an indi-cation of the direction of the work, but not yet the workitself. 
 In this arena, Marxists cannot present their practical conclusions in a “constructive” form, for “reasons beyondour control”. 
 It would therefore be a liquidationist error to exaggerate the importance of this arena. 
 The most that can be done here is to indicate the direction , and that only i n the form of a criticism of the Cadets. 
 Novoye Vremya and Zemshchina ,128 in teasing the Cadets, draw a picture of the Cadets being eaten , and that is all. 
 Rech , for obvious reasons, pretends to accept this “inter-pretation”. 
 The Korobkas and Kuskovas make the same pre-tence—some from sheer stupidity, and others from sheer “pro-Cadet flunkeyism”. 
 But every politically literate person sees very well that Marxist “Cadet-eating”, on absolutely every point of its criticism of the Cadets, indicates the direction of a different “opposition”, if I may use this unsuitable term. 
 When “eating” a Cadet because of Karaulov’s “pious” speeches, a Marxist is not in a position to develop his point of view constructively. 
 But any literate person understandsthat democracy cannot remain true to the name if it is pious. 
 When “eating” a Cadet because of Gredeskul’s speeches, a Marxist is not in a position to develop his point of viewconstructively. 
 But any literate person realises that democra-cy cannot remain true to the name if it shares Gredeskul’s views. 
 When a Marxist—but we should never finish if we under-took to list in this manner all the questions and points ofour “Cadet-eating”. 
 The two examples are enough to makeour thesis on the second circumstance perfectly clear: accu-sations of Cadet-eating are a form of expressing the philistine , harmful , bad prejudice that a certain arena is an adequate arena. 
 We shall remain “Cadet-eaters”, incidentally with the very aim of combating that harmful prejudice.

—y THE WORKERS AND PRAVDA Pravda has already summed up some of the results of its six months’ work. 
 These results showed first of all and above all that only through the efforts of the workers themselves, only through the tremendous upsurge of their enthusiasm, their resolve and stubbornness in the struggle, and only after the April-May movement, was it possible for the St. 
 Petersburgworkers’ newspaper, Pravda , to appear. 
 In its summing up, Pravda confined itself for a start to the data on group donations made by workers to their daily newspaper. 
 These data reveal to us only a small part of the workers’ support; they do not tell us about the much morevaluable and difficult direct support—moral support, sup-port through personal participation, support for the policyof the newspaper, support through contributing materials,discussing and circulating the paper, etc. 
 But even the limited data at the disposal of Pravda showed that a very impressive number of workers’ groups haddirectly linked themselves with it. 
 Let us cast a general glance at the results.

 18 March ”..........

. 
 551 Altogether five hundred and fifty-one groups of workers supported Pravda by their donations. 
 It would be interesting to sum up the results of a whole number of other collections and donations by workers. 
We have constantly seen in Pravda reports on contributions in support of various strikes. 
 We have also seen reportson collections for the victims of repressions, for the Lenagoldfields victims, for individual Pravda editors, collections for the election campaign, for relief of the famine-stricken, and so on and so forth. 
 The varied nature of these collections makes it much more difficult to assess the results here, and we are not yet in aposition to say whether a statistical summary can give asatisfactory picture of the matter. 
 But it is obvious in any case that these varied collections take up a very substantial part of the workers ’ life. 
 As they look through the reports on workers’ collections in connection with letters from factory and office workers in all parts of Russia, Pravda readers, most of whom are dis-persed and separated from one another by the severe ex-ternal conditions of Russian life, gain some idea how the proletarians of various trades and various localities arefighting, how they are awakening to the defence of working-class democracy. 
 The chronicle of workers’ life is only just beginning t o develop into a permanent feature of Pravda . 
 There can be no doubt that subsequently, in addition to letters about abuses in factories, about the awakening of a new section of theproletariat, about collections for one or another field of theworkers’ cause, the workers’ newspaper will receive reportsabout the views and sentiments of the workers, election cam-paigns, the election of workers’ delegates, what the workers read, the questions of particular interest to them, and so on. 
 The workers’ newspaper is a workers’ forum. 
 Before the whole of Russia the workers should raise here, one afteranother, the various questions of workers’ life in generaland of working-class democracy in particular. 
 The workers of St. 
 Petersburg have made a beginning. 
 It is to their energy that the proletariat of Russia owes the workers’ first dailynewspaper after the grim years of social stagnation. 
 Let us, then, carry their cause forward, unitedly supporting and developing the workers’ paper of the capital, the harbinger of the spring to come, when the whole of Russia will be covered by a network of workers’ organisations with workers’newspapers. 
 We, the workers, have yet to build this Russia, and we shall build it.

 to the Pravda text BEFORE AND NOW Eighteen years ago, in 1894, the working-class movement in St. 
 Petersburg was just being born in its modernmass form illumined by the light of the Marxist teach-ing. 
 The seventies had affected a quite insignificant top section of the working class. 
 The foremost representatives of theworking class revealed themselves even then as great leadersof the workers’ democratic movement, but the masses werestill slumbering. 
 Only in the early nineties did they begin to awaken, and at the same time there began a new and more glorious period in the history of the entire democratic move-ment in Russia. 
 Unfortunately, we must confine ourselves here, in our small parallel, to one aspect of one manifestation of theworking-class movement, namely, the economic struggle and economic “exposures”. 
 At that time, in 1894, a very few circles of the foremost workers were heatedly discussing plans for organising fac-tory exposures. 
 A weighty statement by the workers them-selves, addressed to their fellow-workers and pointing outthe more glaring abuses of power by capital, was an exceed-ingly rare occurrence at the time. 
 Speaking of such things publicly was out of the question. 
 But the awakening mass of the workers was able to take up the factory exposures addressed to it, despite alldifficulties and in the face of all obstacles. 
 The strike move-ment was growing, and the connection between the economic struggle of the working class and other, higher forms of struggle was developing irresistibly. 
 The vanguard of Rus-sia s democratic movement was awakening, and ten years later it showed itself in its full stature. 
 It is to this force alone that Russia owes the rupture of the old shell. 
 Those who recall the first factory exposures which the advanced workers of St. 
 Petersburg addressed to the massesin 1894 will find it most interesting and instructive to com-pare them with the factory exposures made by Pravda . 
 This little comparison of one manifestation of the workers’ strug-gle clearly shows the growth of its entire scope, its breadth and depth, its strength, etc. 
 At that time there were a mere five or six factory expo-sures, secretly circulated by workers in several dozencopies. 
 Today there are tens of thousands of copies of the daily Pravda , each making several exposures relating to the most diverse fields of labour. 
 At that time there were a mere five or six so-called “cir-cles”, which discussed—in secret, of course—the state ofaffairs in the factories, with some Marxist intellectual orother participating, and decided on the subject of the pointsto be “published”. 
 Today there are hundreds and thousands of workers’ groups springing up spontaneously, discussing their vital needs andtaking their letters, their exposures, their appeals for re-sistance and unity, to Pravda of their own accord. 
 In a matter of eighteen years, the workers have advanced from the first signs of activity, from a most timid beginning, to a movement that is a mass movement in the most exact sense of the term. 
 We must unfortunately limit ourselves only to parallels of factory exposures. 
 But they, too, show the great pathtravelled, and the goal to which this path leads. 
 Eighteen years are a short span in the history of a whole class which is destined to accomplish the greatest task in the world—the emancipation of mankind. 
 The greater part of this path has been travelled in the dark. 
 But now the road has been reached. 
 Forward with cour-age and determination! Pravda No. 
 104, August 30, 1912 Published according to the Pravda text THE INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF JUDGES The First World Congress of Judges is now in session in Vienna, and so is the Thirty-First Congress of GermanLawyers. 
 The speeches of the high-ranking delegates are dominated by an extremely reactionary spirit. 
 The bourgeois lawyersand judges have launched a campaign against the participa-tion of the people in legal procedure. 
 Two principal forms of such participation are customary in the modern states: (1) the jury, which decides only the question of culpability, while the punishment to be meted out is determined and the procedure directed only by judgesof the crown; (2) the court of assessors, who, like our own“social-estate representatives”, participate in the decisionof all questions on a par with the judges of the crown. 
 And so, the “enlightened” judges of constitutional states are fulminating against all participation of people’s repre-sentatives in legal procedure. 
 One of the delegates, Elsner,inveighing against the jury and the court of assessors, whichhe said led to “anarchy in the application of laws”, defendedinstead the principle of the irremovability of judges. 
 We shall remark in this connection that a liberal de-mand is being put forward here instead of a democratic one and as a disguise for a complete departure from democracy. 
The participation of people’s representatives in a court ofjustice is undoubtedly a democratic principle. 
 The consist-ent application of this principle requires, in the first place,that the election of jurors should not be made conditional on qualifications , i. 
e. 
, the right to be chosen should not be restricted by educational, property, residential or any otherconditions. 
 At present, because of the exclusion of workers, most of the jurors are often particularly reactionary petty bourgeois. 
 This evil should be remedied by developing democracy to its consistent and integral form, and not by basely repu-diating democracy. 
 It is well known that the election ofjudges by the people is recognised in all civilised countriesas the second condition for consistent democracy in thejudicial system. 
 The irremovability of judges, however, which the liberal bourgeois in general and those of Russia in particular makeso much of, is no more than a division of medieval privileges between the Purishkeviches and the Milyukovs, betweenthe feudal lords and the bourgeoisie. 
 In reality it is impos-sible fully to put irremovability into practice, and indeed, it is absurd to defend it with regard to unfit, careless, bad judges. 
 In the Middle Ages, judges were appointed exclu-sively by feudal lords and absolute monarchs. 
 The bourgeoi-sie, which has now obtained ample access to the judiciary,is defending itself against the feudal lords by means of the “principle of irremovability” (for most of the appointed judges will necessarily be—since most of the “educated” lawyers belong to the bourgeoisie—people of bourgeoisorigin). 
 By defending itself in this way against the feudal lords , the bourgeoisie at the same time defends itself against the democrats by upholding the principle of the appoint-ment of judges. 
 It is interesting to note, furthermore, the following passages in a speech by Dr. 
 Ginsberg, a judge from Dresden. 
He enlarged on class justice , i. 
e. 
, on the manifestations of class oppression and the class struggle in modern legalprocedure. 
 “Anyone who imagines that the participation of people’s repre-sentatives in legal proceedings removes class justice is sorely mis-taken,” exclaimed Dr. 
 Ginsberg. 
 Quite so, Your Honour! Democracy in general does not remove the class struggle but merely makes it more con-scious, freer and more open. 
 But this is no argument against democracy. 
 It is an argument in favour of its consistentdevelopment all the way through. 
 “Class justice no doubt exists in reality,” continued the judge from Saxony (and Saxon judges have made a name for themselvesin Germany by their ferocious sentences against workers), “but notat all in the Social-Democratic sense, not in the sense of preference given to the rich as against the poor. 
 On the contrary, class justice exists precisely in the reverse sense. 
 Once I had the following case. 
There were three of us judging—two assessors and myself. 
 One ofthem was an overt Social-Democrat and the other something of thesort. 
 The defendant was a striker who had thrashed a blackleg [‘aworker willing to work’—to quote the exact words used by the Saxon judge], seized him by the throat and shouted: ‘We’ve got you at last, you damned scoundrel!’ “Normally this entails from four to six months imprisonment which is the least punishment that should be meted out for deedsas savage as that. 
 And yet I had the greatest difficulty in preventingthe acquittal of the defendant. 
 One assessor, the Social-Democrat said that I didn’t understand the psychology of the workers. 
 But I told him that I understood very well the psychology of the beatenman. 
” The German papers which carried the text of Judge Ginsberg’s speech inserted “ Laughter ” at the end of the above passage. 
 The lawyers and judges laughed. 
 To tell the truth, had we chanced to hear that Saxon judge, we, too,should have burst out laughing. 
 The doctrine of the class struggle is something against which one can conceivably make an effort to argue in termsof (would-be) science. 
 But one has only to approach the matter from a practical standpoint, to look closely at every-day realities, and behold! the most violent opponent of thisdoctrine can prove to be as gifted an advocate of the classstruggle as the Saxon judge, Herr Ginsberg.

 63, on July 12, * we told the reader about the general strike in Zurich on June 29 (July 12, new style). 
 It may be recalled that the strike was decided in defiance of the leaders of political organisations. 
 The meeting of 425representatives of all the workers’ organisations of Zurich,which declared for the strike, greeted the statement ofthe printers, who were against the strike, with shouts of “ Shame! ” By now the press has published data exposing that oppor-tunism. 
 It appears that the political leaders of the Swiss workers in their opportunism have gone so far as direct betrayal of the Party . 
 It is this scathing but justified phrase that the best organs of the Swiss and German working-class press use in describing the conduct of the Social-Democratic mem-bers of the Zurich Magistracy (Town Council). 
 The ZurichTown Council, defending the capitalists , prohibited strike picketing (and then the workers decided to protest by aone-day general strike). 
 There are nine members on the Zurich Magistracy, in-cluding four Social-Democrats—Erismann, Pflüger, Fogel-sanger and Klöti. 
 And now it has become known that the prohibition of picketing was decided on by the Town Council unanimously , that is to say, Erismann and his three Social-Democratic colleagues voted for it!!! The Zurich Cantonal Government *See pp. 
 160-62 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 had insisted that the Town Council should prohibit all picketing, but the four sapient minnows,129 that is, Zurich Social-Democrats, made a “ compromise ” proposal to prohib-it picketing only in the area of the two mechanical shopswhere work had been stopped. 
 Of course, it was just this partial prohibition of picket-ing that the bourgeoisie was demanding, and the “Social-Democrats’” (?!) proposal was adopted by the bourgeois majority of the Town Council! What is more, the Zurich Town Council recently pub-lished an account of the events occasioned by the generalstrike. 
 The capitalists declared a three-day lock-out by wayof revenge. 
 The Zurich Town Council decided unanimously , with all its four Social-Democratic members participating, that it was necessary to call in troops to reinforce the police in maintaining public order. 
 Nor is that all. 
 The bourgeois Town Council of Zurich furiously attacked, by a series of repressive measures, thosemanual and office workers in the town’s establishmentswho had joined in the strike. 
 It sacked 13 workers and imposed disciplinary punishments (demotion, pay cuts) on another 116. 
 These decisions of the Town Council werelikewise adopted unanimously , with Erismann and his two colleagues participating. 
 The conduct of Erismann and Co. 
 can only be described as betrayal of the Party. 
 It is not surprising that the anarcho-syndicalists enjoy a certain success in Switzerland, since it falls to them tocriticise before the workers a socialist party which toleratessuch opportunist traitors in its ranks. 
 The reason why thetreachery of Erismann and Co. 
 is of major internationalsignificance is that it shows us clearly from what quarter and in what manner the working-class movement is threat-ened with internal corruption. 
 Erismann and Co. 
 are by no means common deserters to the enemy camp; they are simply peaceful petty bourgeois,opportunists who are accustomed to parliamentary “vermi-celli” and who have succumbed to constitutional democratic illusions. 
 The moment the class struggle took a sharp turn, all illusions about constitutional “order” and a “democraticrepublic” were dispelled at once, and our philistines holding the office of Social-Democratic members of the Town Coun-cil lost their heads and slid into the marsh. 
 Class-conscious workers can see from this sad example the consequences which the spread of opportunism in aworkers’ party is bound to have.

 to the Pravda text THE PRIESTHOOD AND POLITICS As is known, the most desperate efforts are being made at present to arouse the entire priesthood for the elections to the Fourth Duma and to organise it as a solid Black-Hundred force. 
 It is most instructive to see that the whole Russian bour-geoisie—governmental, Octobrist, and oppositional Cadetalike—with equal zeal and agitation is exposing and con-demning these plans of the government. 
 The Russian merchant and the Russian liberal landlord (or rather the landlord playing the liberal) fear the strength-ening of an irresponsible government which desires to“cull” for itself the votes of obedient priests. 
 It goes withoutsaying that the democrats’ opposition (to use a mild andinexact term) on this point is far more resolute than thatof the liberals. 
 We have already pointed out in Pravda the undemocratic approach to the question of the priesthood by the liberals,who either frankly defend the arch-reactionary theory of“non-interference” of the priesthood in politics, or recon-cile themselves to this theory. 
 * A democrat is absolutely hostile to the slightest falsifica-tion of suffrage and elections, but he is absolutely in favour of the widest masses of any priesthood being directly andopenly drawn into politics. 
 Non-participation of the priest-hood in the political struggle is the most harmful hypocrisy. 
In reality the priesthood has always participated in politics covertly, and the people would only benefit if it were to pass to overt politics.

 Of outstanding interest in this respect is the article pub-lished in Rech a few days ago by Bishop Mikhail, an adher-ent of the old rites. 
130 That writer’s views are very naïve. 
 He is under the impression, for example, that “clericalismis unknown [to us] in Russia”, that prior to the revolutionit (the priesthood) concerned itself only with heavenlymatters, and so on. 
 But the instructive thing is the actual appraisal of events by this apparently informed man. 
 “It seems indisputable to me that the triumph of the elections will not be a triumph of clericalism,” wrote Bishop Mikhail. 
 “Unit-ed, if artificially, and at the same time, of course, offended by thislording it over their votes and their conscience, the priesthood will see themselves standing between two forces .... 
 H ence the need of a radical change, a crisis, a return to a natural alliance with the people. 
If the clerical and reactionary trend ... succeeded in growing strongand maturing by itself, this perhaps would not come about. 
 Nowthat the priesthood has been roused from its quiescence while stillwith remnants of its former confusion, it will continue its history. 
 And the democracy of the priesthood is the inevitable and closing stage of this history, which will be linked to the priesthood’s strugglein its own behalf. 
” Actually it should be a question of a distribution between the contending classes, and not of “a return to a naturalalliance”, as the author naïvely believes. 
 If the priesthoodis drawn into politics, this distribution will certainly gainin clarity, breadth and political consciousness. 
 As for the fact that informed observers acknowledge the existence, vitality and force of the “remnants of the formerconfusion” even in such a social stratum of Russia as thepriesthood, it is well worth putting on record.

 to the Pravda text YET ANOTHER ANTI -DEMOCRATIC CAMPAIGN That ill-famed publication, Vekhi , which was a tremen-dous success in liberal-bourgeois society, a society thorough-ly imbued with renegade tendencies, was not adequately countered, nor appraised deeply enough, in the democratic camp. 
 This was partly due to the fact that the success of Vekhi occurred at a time of almost complete suppression of the“open” democratic press. 
 Now Mr. 
 Shchepetev comes forward in Russkaya Mysl 131 (August) with a refurbished edition of Vekhi ideas. 
 This is perfectly natural on the part of a Vekhi organ edited by Mr. 
 P. 
 B. 
 Struve, leader of the renegades. 
 But it will hejust as natural for the democrats, particularly the workerdemocrats, to make up now for at least a little of whatthey owe the Vekhi people. 
 I Mr. 
 Shchepetev’s utterances take the form of a modest “Letter from France”— about the Russians in Paris . 
 But behind this modest form there is actually a very definite “discussion” of the Russian revolution of 1905 and the Russian democracy. 
 “That disturbing [Oh! Disturbing to whom , esteemed liberal?], troubled and thoroughly confused year 1905 isfresh in everyone’s memory.... 
 ” “Troubled and thoroughly confused”! What dirt and dregs a person must have in his soul to he able to write like that! The German opponents of the revolution of 1848 called thatyear the “crazy” year. 
 The same idea, or rather the same dull, base fright, is expressed by the Russian Cadet writing in Russkaya Mysl . 
 We shall counter him only with a few facts, the most objective and most “unpretentious” ones. 
 That year wageswere rising as they had never done before. 
 Land rent wasdropping. 
 All forms of association of workers, includingeven domestic servants, were making unprecedented prog-ress. 
 Millions of inexpensive publications on political sub-jects were being read by the people, the masses, the crowd, the “lower ranks”, as avidly as no one had ever read inRussia until then. 
 Nekrasov exclaimed, in times long past: Ah, will there ever be a time (Come soon , come soon , O longed-for day! ) When people will not buy the books Of Blücher or some silly lord , But Gogol and Belinsky ’s works From market stalls bring home. 
 132 The “time” longed for by one of the old Russian democrats came. 
 Merchants stopped dealing in oats and engaged in more profitable business—the sale of inexpensive democraticpamphlets. 
 Democratic books became goods for the market . 
 The ideas of Belinsky and Gogol—which endeared theseauthors to Nekrasov, as indeed to any decent person inRussia—ran through the whole of that new market litera-ture. 
 How “troublesome”! cried the liberal pig, which deems itself educated, but in fact is dirty, repulsive, overfat andsmug, when in actual fact it saw the “people” bringing home from the market—Belinsky’s letter to Gogol. 
 133 And, strictly speaking, it is, after all, a letter from an “intellectual”, announced Vekhi , to thunderous applause from Rozanov of Novoye Vremya and from Anthony, Bishop of Volhynia. 
 What a disgraceful sight! a democrat from among the best Narodniks will say. 
 What an instructive sight! wewill add. 
 How it sobers up those who took a sentimental view of democratic issues, how it steels all the living and strong democratic elements, mercilessly sweeping aside therotten illusions of the Oblomov-minded! It is very useful for anyone who has ever been enchanted with liberalism to be disenchanted with it. 
 And he who wishes to recall the early history of Russian liberalism will certainly see in the liberal Kavelin’s attitude towardsthe democrat Chernyshevsky the exact prototype of theattitude adopted by the Cadet Party of the liberal bour-geoisie towards the Russian democratic movement of the masses . 
 The liberal bourgeoisie in Russia has “found itself” or rather its tail. 
 Is it not time the democrats in Russia found their head? It is particularly intolerable to see individuals like Shchepetev, Struve, Gredeskul, Izgoyev and the rest of theCadet fraternity clutching at the coat-tails of Nekrasov,Shchedrin and others. 
 Nekrasov, who was weak as a person wavered between Chernyshevsky and the liberals, but all his sympathy went to Chernyshevsky. 
 Out of the very samepersonal weakness, Nekrasov occasionally sounded the falsenote of liberal servility, but he himself bitterly deploredhis “falsity” and repented of it in public : I never sold my lyre, although at times , When pressed by unrelenting fateFalse notes would sound among my rhymes. 
 “False notes ” is what Nekrasov himself called the liberal servility he was occasionally guilty of. 
 As for Shchedrin he mocked mercilessly at the liberals, whom he branded for ever by the formula “conformably to villainy”. 
 134 How outdated this formula is as applied to Shchepetev, Gredeskul and the other * Vekhi people! The point now is by no means that these gentlemen must conform to villainy. 
 Not by a long shot! They have created their own theory o f “villainy” on their own initiative and in their own fashion proceeding from Neo-Kantianism and other fashionableEuropean” theories. 
 *The objection will probably be raised that Gredeskul, as well as Milyukov and Co. 
, argued with Vekhi . 
 So they did, but they remained Vekhists for all that.

 II “The thoroughly confused year 1905,” writes Mr. 
 Shchepe-tev. 
 “Everything was mixed up and tangled in the generalconfusion and muddle. 
” On this point, too, we can raise only a few theoretical ob-jections. 
 We believe that historical events should be judgedby the movements of the masses and of classes as a whole, not by the moods of individuals or small groups. 
 The overwhelming majority of Russia’s population con-sists of peasants and workers. 
 What indication is there of a“general confusion and muddle” among this majority of thepopulation? Quite On the contrary, the objective factstestify irrefutably that it was among the mass of the popu-lation that a sorting out unprecedented in breadth and effectiveness was going on, a sorting out which for ever did away with “confusion and muddle ”. 
 Until then, the elements of patriarchal oppression and those of democracy had really been “confused and mixed up’’among the “common people”, making up a “general mud-dle”. 
 Evidence of this is to be found in such objective facts as that Zubatovism 135 and the “Gaponiad” proved possible. 
 It was the year 1905 that for ever put an end to that “muddle”. 
 No previous epoch in Russian history had un-tangled with such extreme clarity, by deeds not by words, relations tangled by age-long stagnation and age-old surviv-als of serfdom. 
 In no other epoch had so distinctly and “efficiently” the classes become demarcated, the attitude of the mass of the population defined, and the theories and programmes of the “intellectuals” tested by the actions o f millions. 
 How was it, then, that indisputable historical facts could be so greatly distorted in the mind of the educated and liberal writer of Russkaya Mysl ? The explanation is very simple: this Vekhi spokesman seeks to impose his subjective sentiments on the whole people. 
 He himself and his entiregroup—the liberal-bourgeois intelligentsia—found them-selves at that time in a particularly “muddled”, “thoroughly confused”, position. 
 And the liberal shifts his discontent— a natural result of this muddle and of the fact that themasses had exposed the utter worthlessness of liberalism— to the masses , thus laying his own fault at someone else’s door. 
 Indeed, was not the liberals’ position a muddled one in June 1905? Or after August 6, when they called for par-ticipation in the Bulygin Duma but the people went in fact past and beyond the Duma? Or in October 1905, when theliberals had to “trail along behind” and call the strike “glo-rious” although only the day before they had fought against it? Or in November 1905, when the pitiful impotence of liberalism fully came to light, being demonstrated by sostriking a fact as Struve’s visit to Witte? If the Vekhist Shchepetev cares to read the Vekhist Izgoyev’s little book about Stolypin, he will see that Izgoyevhad to admit that “muddle” in the Cadets’ position “between two fires” in the First and Second Dumas. 
 And this “mud-dle” and impotence of liberalism were an inevitable devel-opment, for the liberals had no mass support either among the bourgeoisie above or among the peasantry below. 
 Mr. 
 Shchepetev closes his argument on the history of the Russian revolution with the following gem: “However, all that muddle was very short-lived. 
 The upper ranks freed themselves little by little from the almost panicterror that had gripped them and, having arrived at the fairly simple conclusion that a good company of soldiers was more effec-tive than all revolutionary verbiage, equipped ‘punitive expedi-tions’ and set rapid-firing justice into motion. 
 The results exceededall expectations. 
 In a matter of two or three years, the revolutionwas destroyed and eradicated to such an extent that certain securityinstitutions were compelled to stage it in some places.... 
” While we could provide at least some theoretical commen-tary for the author’s previous discourses, now we havenot even this possibility. 
 We must confine ourselves to fast-ening this glorious discourse to the pillory in as high a posi-tion as possible, so that it can be seen for as long a time andfrom as far off as possible. 
 However, we can also ask the reader: is it surprising that the Octobrist Golos Moskvy , as well as the nationalist Judas-like 136 Novoye Vremya , quoted Shchepetev with the greatest delight? In fact, what is the difference between the “historical” appraisal given by the “Constitutional-Demo-cratic” magazine and that given by the above-mentioned two publications? III Mr. 
 Shchepetev devotes most space to sketches of life in exile. 
 To find an analogy of these sketches, one would have to dig up Russky Vestnik137 of Katkov’s day and take from it novels portraying high-minded Marshals of the Nobility,good-natured and contented muzhiks, and disgruntledbrutes, scoundrels and monsters called revolutionaries. 
 Mr. 
 Shchepetev has observed Paris (assuming that he has) with the eyes of a philistine embittered against the demo-cratic movement, who could see nothing but “unrest” inthe appearance in Russia of the first democratic pamphletsfor the masses. 
 It is known that everyone sees abroad what he chooses to. 
 Or, in other words, everyone sees in new conditions his own self . 
 A member of the Black Hundreds sees abroad splendid landlords, generals and diplomats. 
 A secret policeagent sees there the noblest policemen. 
 A liberal Russianrenegade sees in Paris well-meaning concierges and “effi-cient ” * shopkeepers who teach the Russian revolutionary that among them “humanitarian and altruistic sentiments had too much suppressed personal requirements, often to the detriment of the general progress and cultural advancement of the whole of our country”. 
 ** A lackey in spirit is naturally keen above all else on the gossip and petty scandals prevailing in the servants’ room. 
It goes without saying that a shopkeeper or a lackey-mindedconcierge takes no notice of the ideological issues discussed at Paris meetings and in the Paris Russian-language press. 
 How can he see, indeed, that this press raised, as early as1908, for example, the very same questions concerning thesocial nature of the June Third regime, the class roots of the new trends among the democrats, and so on, *** as found their way much later, and in much narrower and more dis-torted (and curtailed) form, into the press “protected” byreinforced security measures? Shopkeepers and lackeys, however “intellectual” the garb in which people with such a mentality array themselves, *See Mr. 
 Shchepetev’s article, p.

 —Ed. 
 cannot notice and grasp these questions. 
 If a particular lackey is called a “publicist” contributing to a liberal maga-zine, he, that “publicist”, will pass over in complete silence the great ideological questions which are posed openlyand clearly nowhere but in Paris. 
 On the other hand, this“publicist” will tell you in detail all that is well known inthe servants’ rooms. 
 He, this noble Cadet, will tell you in the magazine of the most noble Mr. 
 Struve, that a hapless emigrant-prosti-tute was evicted from “the flat of a very well-known womanrevolutionary in Paris”, “not without help from the police”;that the “unemployed” again made a row at a charity ball;that a copyist in a house familiar to Mr. 
 Shchepetev “hadrather a considerable sum of money advanced to him and then began to absent himself”; that the exiles “rise at noon and go to bed after 1 or 2 a. 
m. 
, and there are visitors andnoise and arguments and disorder all day long”. 
 All this the lackey magazine of the Cadet Mr. 
 Struve will tell you in detail and with illustrations, with gusto andspiced with pepper—just as well as Menshikov and Rozanov of Novoye Vremya do it. 
 “Give me money or I’ll punch you on the jaw—this is the unam-biguously hostile form which the relations between the upper andlower ranks of the exiles have taken. 
 True, this formula has not be-come widespread, and ‘the extreme trend among the lower ranks’ has become represented [this is how the educated Cadet writes inMr. 
 Struve’s magazine!] by a mere couple of dozens of very doubt-ful elements that are perhaps even guided by a skilful hand fromoutside. 
” Pause at this statement, reader, and think of the differ-ence between an ordinary lackey and a lackey-minded pub-licist. 
 Ordinary lackeys—meaning the bulk, of course, which does not include those politically-conscious elements that have already adopted a class point of view and are seekinga way out of their lackey’s position—are unsophisticated,uneducated, and often illiterate and ignorant; it is pardon-able for them to have a naïve passion for relating whateverreaches them more easily than anything else, and is closest and clearest to them. 
 Lackey-minded publicists, on the other hand, are “educated” persons who are well received inall the finest drawing-rooms. 
 They are aware that the num-ber of common blackmailers among the exiles is very insig-nificant (“a couple of dozens” for thousands of exiles). 
 They even realise that these blackmailers “are perhaps guided ” by a “ skilful hand ”—from the tea-room of the Union of the Russian People. 
 And because he realises all this, the lackey-minded pub-licist operates as befits the “educated”. 
 He certainly knowshow to cover up his tracks and make the most of his goods!He is not a venal hack of the Black Hundreds—nothing of the kind. 
 He “ himself ” has even pointed out that perhaps someone is guiding the dozen or two of blackmailers, but atthe same time it is precisely and solely those blackmailers rows and the absenteeism of copyists that he tells about! The Novoye Vremya school for “ writers ” of Russkaya Mysl has not gone to waste. 
 Suvorin of Novoye Vremya boasted that he had never received any subsidies—he merely “knew himself” how to hit the right tone. 
 Russkaya Mysl receives no subsidies—God forfend! It merely “knows itself” how to hit the right tone, a tone pleas-ing to the ear of the Novoye Vremya people and Guchkov’s “stalwarts”. 
 IV Yes, there is much that is painful in the life of the exiles. 
 It is exiles, and they alone, who in the years of social stag-nation and lull raised major questions of principle concern-ing all Russian democrats. 
 There is more poverty and wantamong them than elsewhere. 
 The proportion of suicides isparticularly great among them, and the proportion of thoseamong them whose whole being is one bundle of sick nervesis incredibly, monstrously great. 
 Indeed, how could things be different with tormented people? Different people will take interest in different things when they find themselves among exiles. 
 Some of them willbe interested in the open discussion of major political ques-tions of principle. 
 Others will be interested in stories abouta row at a ball, about an unscrupulous copyist, or about the distaste which concierges and shopkeepers have for the exiles’ way of life. 
 Everyone to his taste. 
 Nevertheless, when you experience all the hardships of a tormented, drab, morbidly nervous life in exile and think of the life of the Shchepetevs, Struves, Golovins, Izgoyevs and Co. 
, you cannot help saying: what an immense happi-ness not to belong to this society of “respectable people”, to the society where these individuals are received andwhere people shake hands with them! Probably, rows do not occur in this “respectable society”. 
 Prostitutes do not find themselves in the position of all butroom-mates of these gentlemen. 
 Oh, no. 
 They stay in other quarters. 
 The unemployed raise no rows at dances arranged by these people. 
 For those dances are perfectly decorous. 
 They keepthese things apart: the prostitutes (from among the unem-ployed) live in one flat, while the dances are held in another. 
And if they take on a copyist, they never allow any depravity, such as letting the copyist take his pay in advance and then dare to absent himself. 
 Rows over money are out of the question with them. 
 Near them are no starving, tormented, unnerved people,ready to commit suicide. 
 And if “the millions fraternise”today with “science” in the persons of Messrs. 
 Struve and Co. 
, tomorrow with the title of deputy in the persons of Messrs. 
 Golovin and Co. 
, and the day after with the titlesof deputy and lawyer in the persons of Messrs. 
 Maklakovand Co. 
 138—where do rows come in here? Those are all noble acts. 
 If the writings of the Struves, Gredeskuls, Shchepetevs and Co. 
 against the democrats give pleasure to the Ryabushinskys, etc. 
, what is wrong with that? After all, Struve receives no subsidies—he “him-self” hits the right tone! No one can say that Russkaya Mysl is a kept woman of the Ryabushinskys. 
 It will occur to no one to compare the pleasure which the Ryabushinskysderive from certain “publicists” with the pleasure which serf girls gave the landlords in the old days by scratching their heels for them. 
 Indeed, what blame attaches to Mr. 
 Struve or Mr. 
 Gredes-kul or Shchepetev, etc. 
, because their writings and speeches,which express their own convictions, are a sort of heel-scratching for the Russian merchants and landlords, who are embittered against the revolution? What is so shocking about the fact that Mr. 
 Golovin, an ex-deputy, has got himself a profitable concession? After all, he has relinquished the title of deputy!! That means that when he was a deputy there was no concession as yet— it was only just in the making. 
 And when he obtained a con-cession, he ceased to be a deputy. 
 Is it not clear that thereis no dirty business here? Is it not obvious that only slanderers can point a finger at Maklakov? Did he not defend Tagiyev—as he himselfstated in a letter published in Rech —“according to his con-victions”? There can be no doubt whatever that no Paris con-cierge or shopkeeper will find anything—anything at all—reprehensible, awkward or shocking in the way of life or inthe actions of all these respectable Cadet people. 
 V Mr. 
 Shchepetev’s general statement of principle is worth reproducing in full: “Hitherto, and above all in the circles taking part in the revolu-tion, humanitarian and altruistic sentiments have suppressed per-sonal requirements to an excessive degree, often to the detriment of the general progress and cultural advancement of the whole of our country. 
 Too often the desire for the ‘public good’ and for the ‘wel-fare of the whole people’ made people forget about themselves, abouttheir personal needs and requirements, so much so that the socialsentiments and aspirations themselves could not be translated intoreality in the form of positive [!!], creative, entirely conscious work, and fatally led to passive forms of self-sacrifice. 
 Indeed, not only in this particular sphere, but also in the sphere of the most ordinaryrelations, the requirements of the individual were constantly sup-pressed in every manner—by a ‘guilty conscience’ which often swelledthis thirst for heroism and self-sacrifice to hypertrophic proportions,on the one hand, and by an inadequate appraisal of life itself due to the low standard of our culture, on the other hand. 
 The result is a constant split personality, a constant sense of the wrongness andeven ‘sinfulness’ of one’s life, a constant desire to sacrifice oneself,to come to the aid of the propertyless and disinherited, and, finally,to go into ‘the camp of the perishing’—a fact which has found sofull and vivid expression in our literature. 
 “Nothing of the kind is met with in the views and moral princi-ples of the French people. 
” This is a commentary on Mr. 
 Gredeskul’s political and programmatic statements which Rech published without a single reservation and which Pravda (No. 
 85) recalled when Rech chose to forget them. 
 This is a continuation and repetition of Vekhi . 
 Once again we can and must see from the example of this discourse that Vekhi is merely making a show of fighting against the “in-telligentsia” and that it is in fact fighting against democracy , which it completely renounces. 
 It is particularly necessary to stress the unity of Vekhi , Gredeskul and Rech today, during the elections, when the Cadets, playing at democracy, are doing their utmost to obscure and side-track all the truly important and vital political questions of principle. 
 One of the urgent practicaltasks facing the democrats is to raise these questions atelection meetings, to explain to as large an audience aspossible the meaning and significance of the talk of theShchepetevs and all the Vekhists, and to expose the hypoc-risy of Rech and the Milyukovs when they try to disclaim responsibility for Russkaya Mysl , although those who were for it are Cadet Party members . 
 The “arguments” with the Vekhists, the “polemics” of the Gredeskuls, Milyukovs and other such gentlemen againstthem, are no more than eyewash, nothing but a hypocritical disguise for the deep fundamental solidarity between the entire Cadet Party and Vekhi . 
 Indeed, how can anyone “argue” against the basic propositions of the passage quotedabove? How can he remain in the same party with peoplewho hold such views, without bearing full responsibility for this advocacy of an emphatic repudiation of the element-ary principles of all democracy? The issue is obscured by those who are willing to present it à la Vekhi , in terms of contrasting “individualism” with “altruism”, and so on. 
 The political meaning of these phrasescould not be clearer—they are a volte-face against democracy, a volte-face in favour of counter-revolutionary liberalism. 
 We must realise that this volte-face is no accident, but a result of the class position of the bourgeoisie. 
 And we mustdraw from this the necessary political conclusions as regardsthe clear demarcation of democracy from liberalism. 
 Unlesswe are aware of these realities, and unless we bring themhome to the mass of the population, there can be no ques-tion of any real step forward.

 I. 
 THE UNITY OF THE CADETS AND NOVOYE VREMYA People in our country are only too often prone to regard the election campaign as a struggle for mandates, i. 
e. 
,for cosy seats in the Duma. 
 As far as the class-conscious workers are concerned, this campaign is primarily, and more than anything else, astruggle for principles, i. 
e. 
, for fundamental views, for political convictions. 
 This struggle, which is being waged before the masses and which draws the masses into politics,is one of the principal advantages of the representativesystem. 
 Our Cadets, in reply to our posing fundamental questions about liberalism and democracy, about the policy of “peace” and that of the class struggle, dodge all polemics on the substance of the matter, merely hissing right and left overour alleged “Cadet-eating”. 
 And yet facts indicating a touching unity between the Cadets and the Novoye Vremya people in the appraisal of the cardinal issues of life in Russia strike the eye. 
 The eighth issue of Russkaya Mysl has appeared. 
 This magazine is edited by the Cadet Struve, and contributorsto it are Izgoyev, Severyanin, Galich and many otherCadets. 
 In that issue Mr. 
 A. 
 Shchepetev printed, under the title “Russians in Paris”, a foul Black-Hundred lampoon against the revolution and revolutionaries. 
 Novoye Vremya imme-diately caught up the tune struck up by Russkaya Mysl ; it quoted a whole series of “gems” from it, and exclaimed gleefully: “To think that those wretched representatives of mankind [i. 
e. 
, the revolutionaries as portrayed by Rus-skaya Mysl ] claimed the role of renovators of Russian life. 
” What will the official Cadet Rech say to that? Will it be that that “has no bearing” on the elections, i. 
e. 
, on thestruggle for cosy seats? Or that Rech “cannot be held re-sponsible” for Russkaya Mysl , i. 
e. 
, the party cannot be held responsible for its members whom no Cadet conference has ever so much as condemned? Let Rech twist and turn, and let unprincipled and spine-less people shrug their shoulders at our “Cadet-eating”—we shall never tire of saying to the citizens of Russia: lookinto the principles of the Cadets and don’t remain dis-gracefully indifferent when the “Constitutional-Democrats” are slinging mud at the democrats. 
 Here are a few passages from the article of Mr. 
 Shchepetev, the Black-Hundred Cadet; although few, they are the mostprominent and, moreover, are concerned with questionsof principle, not gossip. 
 “Hitherto, and above all in the circles taking part in the revolution, humanitarian [i. 
e. 
, man-loving] and altru-istic sentiments [i. 
e. 
, disinterested sentiments not limitedto the effort to keep one’s skin whole] have suppressedpersonal requirements to an excessive degree , often to the detriment of the general progress and cultural advancement of the whole of our country. 
 Too often the desire for the ‘public good’ and for the ‘welfare of the whole people’ [theironical inverted commas were put in by Russkaya Mysl ] made people forget about themselves, about their personalneeds and requirements .... 
 The result is a constant split personality, a constant sense of the wrongness and even ‘sin-fulness’ of one’s life, a constant desire to sacrifice oneself, to come to the aid of the propertyless and disinherited , and, finally, to go into ‘the camp of the perishing’—a fact whichhas found so full and vivid an expression in our literature”(Russkaya Mysl No. 
 8, pp. 
 152-53). 
 How contemptible is a party pretending to be democratic that tolerates in its ranks these gentlemen who sling mud at the most rudimentary, the most elementary premisesconvictions and principles of the whole of democracy ! The liberal bourgeoisie has developed a hatred for democ-racy, as has been proved by the issue of Vekhi , as is proved monthly by Russkaya Mysl , and as has been proved by the Karaulovs and Gredeskuls. 
 The liberals themselves are placing a bar between them-selves and the democrats.

 109 , September 5, 1912 Published according Signed: I. 
 V. 
 to the Pravda text CONCERNING N. 
 S. 
 POLYANSKY ’S LETTER N. 
 S. 
 Polyansky’s letter from the countryside, published in this issue of Pravda , poses a very interesting question. 
 It would be desirable for the peasants themselves to com-ment on this question as often as possible. 
 For our part, we consider it necessary to point out the following. 
 N. 
 S. 
 Polyansky is perfectly right in saying that only an “idle parasite” would regard the volost meeting as agathering of fools. 
 Only the peasants themselves can decide which form of land tenure and landownership is to be pre-ferred in a particular locality. 
 All interference on the partof the law or the administration in the unfettered use ofthe land by the peasants is a survival of the serf-owningsystem. 
 Such interference can only do harm, it can onlyhumiliate and insult the peasant. 
 A worker-peasant vividly showed, in his letter published in Pravda No. 
 38, the absurd red tape resulting from such interference. 
 Let us now see what view the tens of millions of people who are for ever working and are for ever being exploitedshould take of the question: khutor or village commune? What these people have to worry about is not at all the choice between the khutor and the village commune. 
 They must worry about who is exploiting them and how they canlighten or do away with this exploitation. 
 In European Russia, for example, 30,000 of the big land-lords own 70,000,000 dessiatines of land, and 10,000,000 poor peasants own as much. 
 Whether these peasants are settled on khutors or in communes, their paupers’ living conditions will not be changed in the slightest. 
 If you have seven dessiatines of bad land for your whole family, while your landlord neighbour has 2,000 dessiatines of excellent land, the result will be almost the same as under serfdom, no matter whether you live on a khutor or in a commune. 
 Hungry people are being deluded with talk about khutors or communes, about a buckwheat pie or a cabbage pie. 
 Mean-while they have to eat turnip tops and live on marshy orsandy land; they have to do corvée for using the watering-place, the pastures and ploughlands. 
 By means of khutors attempts are being made to create “small landlords” to defend the big ones. 
 But millionsand tens of millions of peasants will starve even more inconsequence. 
 In Western Europe, a really rapid and successful develop-ment of agriculture occurred only where all survivals of feudal oppression had been completely abolished. 
 In the genuinely free countries, where agriculture is well organised, there remains only one force that is crush-ing the peasant and the worker: the force of capital. 
 Thereis only one way of countering this force—a free alliance of the wage-workers and ruined peasants. 
 Such alliances will develop into a new social system under which cultivatedlands, efficient machinery, steam and electricity will serveto improve the life of the working people themselves, andnot to enrich a handful of millionaires. 
 Pravda No. 
 118, September 15, 1912 Published according Signed: Fr. 
 to the Pravda text THE POLITICAL LINE It is beyond doubt that the character of Nevskaya Zvezda and Pravda has been fully established, and is familiar not only to the workers, but also to all the political parties of Russia—thanks to the attacks made on Pravda and Nevskaya Zvezda by the Black Hundreds and the Octobrists ( Rossiya , Novoye Vremya , Golos Moskvy , etc. 
), as well as by the lib-erals ( Rech , Zaprosy Zhizni , etc. 
). 
 An appraisal of the political line followed by the two newspapers is of particular interest in the light of the elec-tion campaign, for this appraisal is the inevitable touch-stone of views on basic questions of principle. 
 That is whywe propose to dwell on N. 
 Nikolin’s article in Nevsky Golos No. 
 9, about the line of Pravda and Nevskaya Zvezda . 
 The article contains not a few exceedingly angry words, as the reader will see; but we can (and must) disregard that in view of the author’s attempt to touch on the essence ofimportant questions. 
 “I must admit,” wrote N. 
 Nikolin, “that in many respects Pravda fulfils rather satisfactorily its task of being an exponent of the desires,needs, requirements and interests of the Russian proletariat. 
 Unfor-tunately, it considerably depreciates this useful work of its by a per-fectly absurd presentation of political realities that is far from the truth and extremely harmful in its consequences. 
” We shall leave the angry words aside and take the impor-tant thing: the presentation of political realities. 
 We readi-ly forgive the writer his annoyance for this straightforwardapproach to the question, which is really fundamental. 
 Letus argue on the substance of the matter. 
 It is, in fact, im-possible to take a single step in the field of practical work unless one has firm views as to what our “political realities” actually are. 
 N. 
 Nikolin answers his straight question as follows: “Pravda —which in this case follows the example of Nevskaya Zvezda —assures its readers that the working class must build a new Russia despite the liberals. 
 This sounds proud, of course, but it con-tains nothing but nonsense. 
 Nobody is building a new Russia—sheis being built [italics by N. 
 Nikolin himself] in the complicated process of the struggle of different interests, and the task of the work-ing class is not to make chimerical plans for building a new Russiafor others and in spite of all these others , but to create, within the latter, the most favourable conditions for its further development. 
” Here, too, we readily forgive the writer his “spleen”, his extreme irritation, because he tries to take the bull by the horns. 
 N. 
 Nikolin is more frank, sincere and thought-ful than many liquidators in touching here on one of thedeepest sources of our deep differences. 
 “Nobody is building a new Russia—she is being built in the process—”. 
 Anyone will recognise in this wonderful argument the basic and invariable keynote of the entire liquidationist (or broader still, entire opportunist) music. 
 Let us, therefore, analyse this argument carefully. 
If a new Russia is being built in the process of the struggle of different interests, this means that the classes which have different interests are building a new Russia in different ways. 
 This is as clear as daylight. 
 What sense is there, then, in N. 
 Nikolin’s contrast : “nobody is building a new Russia— she is being built , etc. 
”? No sense whatever. 
 It is nonsense from the point of view of the most elementary logic. 
 But this nonsense has a logic of its own, the logic of opportunism, which inevitably, and not accidentally, slips into Nikolinist errors as it tries to defend its position “inMarxist fashion”. 
 It is on this “logic of opportunism” thatwe must dwell. 
 Whoever says that a new Russia is being built by such-and-such classes stands so firmly on the basis of Marxism that not only N. 
 Nikolin’s angry words, but even—even “unity-liquidationist” conferences and all their verbal“thunderbolts” cannot shake him. 
 Whoever says that “nobody is building a new Russia— she is being built , etc. 
”, slips from the objectivism of the class struggle (i. 
e. 
, from Marxism) to the “objectivism” of a bourgeois justification of reality. 
 Herein lies the sourceof that sinful fall from Marxism into opportunism whichNikolin (unwittingly) commits. 
 If I say: a new Russia has to be built in such-and-such a way from the standpoint of, say, truth, justice, equalised labour, and so on, it will be a subjectivist approach that will land me in the sphere of chimeras. 
 In practice, it isthe class struggle, and not my very best wishes, that willdetermine the building of a new Russia. 
 My ideals of build-ing a new Russia will not be chimerical only if they expressthe interests of an actually existing class, whose living conditions compel it to act in a particular sense. 
 By thus adopting a stand for the objectivism of the class struggle,I do not in the least justify reality, but, on the contrary,indicate in this reality itself the deepest sources (though they are invisible at first sight) and the forces that cantransform it. 
 But if I say: “nobody is building a new Russia—she is being built in the struggle of interests”, I at once throw a certain veil over the clear picture of the struggle of such-and-such classes, and make a concession to those who see only those actions of the ruling classes, i. 
e. 
, particularlythe bourgeoisie, that are on the surface. 
 I slip involun-tarily into justifying the bourgeoisie; instead of the objectivism of the class struggle, I adopt as a criterion thebourgeois trend that is most conspicuous, or that is suc-cessful for the time being. 
 We shall illustrate this by an example from history. 
 New Germany (the Germany of the second half of the nine-teenth century) was “built” in the process of the struggle of different interests. 
 No educated bourgeois will questionthis, nor will he go farther than that. 
 But here is how Marx reasoned during the most “critical” period of the building of new Germany. 
 “The upper bourgeoisie,” wrote Marx in 1848, “ever anti-revolutionary, concluded a defensive and offensive alliance with the reactionaries for fear of the people, that is to say,the workers and the democratic bourgeoisie. 
” /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR “The French bourgeoisie of 1789 did not for a moment leave its allies, the peasants, in the lurch. 
 It knew that its rule was grounded in the destruction of feudalism in the countryside, the creation of a free landowning peasant class. 
 “The German bourgeoisie of 1848 is, without the least compunction, betraying the peasants, who are its mostnatural allies, the flesh of its flesh and without whom it ispowerless against the aristocracy. 
 “The continuance of feudal rights ... such is the result of the German revolution of 1848. 
 The mountain broughtforth a mouse. 
” 139 In Marx, the classes which built new Germany stand out at once as if they were living. 
 A bourgeois scholar who justifies reality in the name of “objectivism” says-Bismarck defeated Marx, Bismarck took into account how “new Germany was built in the complicated process of the struggle between different inter-ests”. 
 Marx, however, “made chimerical plans for building”a Great-German democratic republic in spite of the liberals,with the aid of the workers and the democratic bour-geoisie (that bourgeoisie which does not enter into alliance with reaction). 
 That is what bourgeois scholars say in a thousand varia-tions. 
 In examining this question from a purely theoreticalstandpoint, let us ask ourselves what their mistake is. 
 Itis that they cover up and obscure the class struggle. 
 It is that (by means of the would-be profound turn of speech, “Germany was built in the process, etc. 
”) they gloss over the circumstance that Bismarck Germany was built by the bour-geoisie, who by its own “betrayals and treachery” madeitself “powerless against the nobility”. 
 Marx, however, was enabled by the objectivism of the class struggle to understand political reality a hundred times more deeply and accurately, without justifying it at all but, onthe contrary, indicating and singling out in it the classeswhich were building a democratic Germany, and were able tobecome the bulwark of democracy and socialism even whenevents had taken a turn exceptionally favourable to Bis-marck. 
 Marx understood political reality so correctly and so deeply that he was able in 1848, half a century in advance, to appraise the essence of Bismarck Germany as the Germany of a bourgeoisie “powerless against the nobility”. 
 At the elections in 1912, sixty-four years after Marx had made his appraisal, the liberals fully confirmed it by their behaviour. 
 Marx and the Marxists, who had been waging a ruthless struggle against the liberals since 1848—a struggle thatwas unprecedented in acuteness and evoked a universal howlfrom the liberals (excuse me for using this sharp phrase esteemed Nikolin!)—were by no means advocates of a “chi-mera” when they upheld the “plan” for a Great-Germandemocratic state. 
 On the contrary, by upholding their “plan”, propagating it steadfastly and lashing the liberals and democrats whowere betraying it, Marx and the Marxists were educating the very class which embodied the vital forces of “new Germany” and which, thanks to Marx’s consistent andwhole-heartedly resolute propaganda, now stands fullyarmed, ready to fulfil its historic role of grave-digger, notonly of the Bismarckian bourgeoisie, but of all bourgeoisiein general. 
 * * * The example from German history reveals to us the logic of opportunism in the views of Nikolin, who angrily abuses us for our “violent Cadet-eating” precisely because he is unaware that he himself is drifting to the liquidation-ist ideas of a liberal labour policy. 
 The more N. 
 Nikolin (who is not alone!) flies into a rage and tries to brush us aside, the more explicitly and cir-cumstantially will we, who are publicists, repeat to himthat our struggle against the Cadets and the liquidators isprompted by considerations which have been deeply thought out and which for more than five years (for more than ten years, to be exact) have been reaffirmed many times by theofficial decisions of all Marxists. 
 The trouble with N. 
 Niko-lin, as well as with the liquidators whom he defends, isthat they have nothing even approximately formulated, definite and clear with which to counter these numerous, precise, formal tactical decisions adopted long ago. 
 It is not just a “proud” phrase to say that “the workers must build a new Russia in spite of the liberals”. 
 N. 
 Nikolin knows very well that this idea is expressed in a number of tactical decisions recognised by most Marxists. 
 This is, in effect, a simple summing up of Russia’s political experi-ence during at least the past decade. 
 It is an absolutely indis-putable historical fact that during the last ten years theRussian working class has been building a new Russia “in spite of the liberals”. 
 Such “building” work is never wasted, whatever the temporary “successes” of the Russian pre-tenders to the role of a Bismarck. 
 Russian opportunism—vague, indistinct, and eel-like, as it is in other countries—is unable to express its viewsdefinitely and clearly, to state formally that the workingclass must not build a new Russia in spite of the liberals but must do this, that and the other. 
 Opportunism would not be opportunism if it were capable of giving clear and straightforward answers. 
 But it expresses its discontent overthe workers’ policy, and the fact that it gravitates towardsthe bourgeoisie, by saying: “Nobody is building a newRussia—she is being built in the process of the struggle of interests. 
” And of what is being built , it is the “building” which the nobility and the bourgeoisie are doing, with the liberalscorrecting it, that is most conspicuous and striking, and enjoys momentary success and the admiration of the “crowd”more than anything else. 
 “Why try to analyse which classesare building and how—that is all a chimera; we must take what is being built ”—this is the true meaning of Nikolin’s argument, and the “logic of opportunism”. 
 This is indeed forgetting the class struggle. 
 This is what constitutes the main principle of a liberal labour policy. 
It is through this sort of “logic” that the role of the workingclass is reduced from leadership of a genuine, consistent, whole-hearted democratic movement to spade-work for the liberals. 
 Hence the fact, only too familiar to us Russians, that in words the opportunists acknowledge that the party of the proletariat, too, should have an “independent” line,which, of course, is acknowledged by Nikolin as well. 
 But in fact he defends a line that is not independent , but is the line of a liberal labour policy. 
 Nikolin tries to explain and to show us how very immaterial it is to proclaim the independence of the working class. 
 The liquidators’ platform, reported in Nevsky Golos No. 
 8, also proclaimed it as did Nikolin himself. 
 But evenas he proclaims “independence”, he is advocating a non-independent policy. 
 By rejecting the idea of the working class pursuing a line of its own in present-day politics and in all questions of democracy (or, in other words , the idea of the working class “building a new Russia”) in spite of the liberals, Ni-kolin virtually calls on the working class to trail behindthe liberals. 
 That is the crux of the matter. 
 That is the “logic of op-portunism”. 
 As regards arguments to the effect that the working class should not be “isolated”, that “the brunt of the struggle for political liberty should not be borne by theworkers”, that what is needed is “co-ordination and notdivision of forces”, and so on, all that is meaninglessrhetoric. 
 In fact, they are all descriptions and paraphrases ofone and the same thing: don’t isolate yourselves ( from the liberals ), “co-ordinate your forces” ( with liberal policy ), recognise liberal policy to be an effective struggle for politi-cal liberty and not for a deal with the Purishkeviches, andso on and so forth. 
 We did not dwell on that rhetoric because one who wants to argue on the substance of the matter should take the real starting-points, the roots of the differences, and not the rhetorical flourishes of a basically wrong line.

 THE SUCCESSES OF THE AMERICAN WORKERS The latest issue of the American labour weekly, Appeal to Reason , received in Europe reports that its circulation has increased to 984,000 copies. 
 The letters and demandscoming in—writes the editor (No. 
 875, September 7, newstyle)—indicate beyond doubt that we shall exceed one million copies in the next few weeks. 
 This figure—a million copies of a socialist weekly which American courts harass and persecute shamelessly and whichis growing and gaining strength under the fire of persecu-tion—shows more clearly than long arguments the kind ofrevolution that is approaching in America. 
 Not long ago the sycophantic Novoye Vremya , a mouth-piece of venal hacks, wrote about the “power of money” inAmerica, relating with malicious joy the facts about themonstrous venality of Taft, Roosevelt, Wilson and, indeed,all Presidential candidates put up by the bourgeois parties. 
 Here is a free, democratic republic for you, hissed the venal Russian newspaper. 
 The class-conscious workers will reply to that calmly and proudly: we have no illusions about the significance ofbroad democracy. 
 No democracy in the world can eliminatethe class struggle and the omnipotence of money. 
 It is notthis that makes democracy important and useful. 
 The im-portance of democracy is that it makes the class struggle broad, open and conscious. 
 And this is not a conjecture ora wish, but a fact. 
 At a time when the membership of the German Social-Democratic Party has grown to 970,000 and when the cir-culation of an American socialist weekly has climbed to 984,000 copies, anyone who has eyes to see must acknowl-edge that a proletarian is powerless when alone but thatmillions of proletarians are all-powerful.

 to the Pravda text THE END OF THE ITALO -TURKISH WAR Representatives of Italy and Turkey have signed pre-liminary terms of peace, according to telegraphic reports. 
 Italy has “won” the war, which she launched a year ago to seize Turkish possessions in Africa. 
 From now on, Tripoliwill belong to Italy. 
 It is worth while taking a look at thistypical colonial war, waged by a “civilised” twentieth-century nation. 
 What caused the war? The greed of the Italian money-bags and capitalists, who need new markets and new achieve-ments for Italian imperialism. 
 What kind of war was it? A perfected, civilised blood-bath, the massacre of Arabs with the help of the “latest”weapons. 
 The Arabs put up a desperate resistance. 
 When, at the beginning of the war, the Italian admirals were incautious enough to land 1,200 marines, the Arabs attacked themand killed some 600. 
 By way of “retaliation”, about 3,000Arabs were butchered, whole families were plundered anddone to death, with women and children massacred incold blood. 
 The Italians are a civilised, constitutional nation. 
 About 1,000 Arabs were hanged. 
The Italian casualties exceeded 20,000, including 17,429 sick, 600 missing and 1,405 killed. 
 The war cost the Italians over 800 million lire, or over 320 million rubles. 
 It resulted in terrible unemployment and industrial stagnation. 
 The Arabs lost about 14,800 lives. 
 Despite the “peace”, the war will actually go on, for the Arab tribes in the heart of Africa, in areas far away from the coast, will refuse to submit. 
 And for a long time to come they will be “civil-ised” by bayonet, bullet, noose, fire and rape. 
 Italy, of course, is no better and no worse than the other capitalist countries. 
 All of them alike are governed by thebourgeoisie, which stops at no carnage in its quest for newsources of profit.

 to the Pravda text A GAME OF CHANCE Novoye Vremya fully discloses the plans of the Russian nationalists. 
 When reading this newspaper, which is “in-fluential” in nationalist quarters, as well as among theOctobrists, the plan that they are firmly pursuing for rob-bing Turkey becomes obvious. 
 As usual, the policy of chauvinism and seizure of foreign territory is being carried out first and foremost by incitingthe general public against Austria. 
 “The Balkan peoples,”writes Novoye Vremya , “have rallied together for a holy war of independence. 
 The Austrian diplomat is on the look-out for the moment when they can be plundered. 
” Austria has torn off a chunk (Bosnia and Herzegovina) and Italy has torn off another (Tripoli); it is now our turnto enrich ourselves—such is the policy of Novoye Vremya . 
 “A holy war of independence” is merely a phrase to deceivesimpletons, for no one in our own Russia has so flouted the truly democratic principles of genuine independence of all peoples as have the nationalists and the Octobrists. 
 But why do the nationalists consider the time favourable for a policy of plunder? This, too, can be clearly seen fromNovoye Vremya . 
 Italy will not fight—it says in effect; as for Austria, it would be risky for her to start a war against the Balkan Slavs because she has a kindred population of many millions, and Germany would not venture a Europeanwar to defeat Turkey. 
 The nationalists’ calculation is frank and shameless to the last degree. 
 While mouthing pompous words about “aholy war of independence” of the peoples, they gamble with the lives of millions in the most cold-blooded way by in-citing the peoples to a carnage for the profit of a handfulof merchants and industrialists. 
 The Triple Alliance (Germany, Austria and Italy) is weak at the moment, for Italy has spent 800 million francs on the war against the Turks, and the “interests” of Italy and Austria do not coincide in the Balkans. 
 Italy wants tosnatch another morsel—Albania—but Austria will not lether. 
 Our nationalists, who count on this, are playing areckless game of chance, relying on the strength and wealthof two powers in the Triple Entente (Britain and France) and on the fact that “Europe” will not want a general war over the Straits or over the “rounding off” of “our”territories at the expense of Asiatic Turkey. 
 In a society of wage slavery, every merchant and every proprietor plays a game of chance, saying as it were: “Ishall either be ruined or make a profit and ruin others. 
” Every year hundreds of capitalists go bankrupt and millions of peasants, handicraftsmen and artisans are ruined. 
 Thecapitalist countries play a similar game of chance with theblood of millions, whom they send into a carnage now here,now there with the aim of seizing foreign territory andplundering their weaker neighbours.

 134, October 4, 1912 Published according to the Pravda text THE PRIESTHOOD IN THE ELECTIONS, AND ELECTIONS WITH THE PRIESTHOOD According to reports in the press, the congresses of small landowners and deans of churches in 46 gubernias of Euro-pean Russia have elected 7,990 delegates, including 6,516 priests. 
 The latter make up 82 per cent. 
 The complete returns for the fifty gubernias cannot much alter this result. 
 Let us, therefore, see what these elections signify. 
The law provides that the small landowners and the par-ishes shall elect one delegate per electoral category estab-lished for participation in the landowners’ congress. 
 This means that the number of delegates must be proportional tothe amount of land owned by the electorate. 
 Statistics for 1905 give the following data for the fifty gubernias of European Russia: Church estates ....... 
. 
 1,900,000 dessiatines Lands privately owned by priests 300,000 ” Total owned by the priesthood 2,200,000 ” Lands privately owned by towns-people .......... 
. 
 3,700,000 ” Lands privately owned by peas-ants .......... 
. 
 13,200,000 ” Lands privately owned by other categories ......... 2,200,000 ” Total of small holdings owned by “laymen ”.......... 
 19,100,000 ” These data probably take account of small holdings to a lesser extent than of the lands owned by the priesthood. 
 Nevertheless, it follows that the small private holdings total 21,300,000 dessiatines, of which priests own 2 200,000 dessiatines, or a little over one-tenth. 
 Yet the priesthood has elected upwards of eight-tenths of the total number of delegates!! How could that come about? It was simple enough. 
 The fact is that small landowners seldom go to elections—theylack the means and take little interest in the matter; be-sides, the police put a thousand obstacles in the way of free elections. 
 The priests, however, have all been “induced” to attend. 
 The priests will vote for the candidates who suit the government. 
 This explains why even the landlords are mur-muring, to say nothing of the bourgeoisie. 
 The Octobristsand the nationalists are murmuring too. 
 They all accuse the government of “ engineering ” the elections. 
 But the landlords and the big bourgeoisie themselves would like to engineer the elections . 
 Thus there is a clash between absolutism, on the one hand, and the landlords and the bourgeois bigwigs, on theother. 
 The government wanted to secure the backing of the landlords and the top strata of the bourgeoisie; as is known, this idea underlies the whole law of June 3, 1907. 
 As it happens, however, the government cannot get along even with the Octobrists. 
 It has not succeeded in organis-ing even a feudal-bourgeois monarchy of a kind “satisfac-tory” to these classes. 
 Unquestionably, this failure has in fact been acknowl-edged by the government, which has set about organisingits own officials in the shape of the subordinate, dependent priesthood! In the science of history, this device of a government which retains the essential features of absolutism is called Bonapartism. 
 In this case, it is not definite classes that serve as a support, or not they alone, and not chiefly, buthand-picked elements, mostly from among various depend-ent sections of the population. 
 How is the possibility of this phenomenon to be explained in “sociological” terms, i. 
e. 
, from the standpoint of the class struggle? It is due to a balance between the forces of the hostile or rival classes. 
 If, for example, the Purishkeviches are competing with the Guchkovs and Ryabushinskys, the gov-ernment may—provided there is a certain balance between the forces of these rivals—gain greater independence (within certain, rather narrow limits, of course) than when either of these classes has a decisive superiority. 
 If, on the otherhand, this government is historically linked by continuityand so on with especially “vivid” forms of absolutism,and if militarist and bureaucratic traditions in the sense of non-electivity of judges and officials are strong in the country, then the limits of that independence will be stillgreater, its manifestations still more open, the methodsused in “picking” voters, and electors voting on ordersfrom above, still more crude, and tyranny still more tan-gible. 
 It is something like this that contemporary Russia is passing through. 
 The “step towards transformation into abourgeois monarchy” * is made more difficult by the borrowing of Bonapartist methods. 
 Whereas in France the bourgeoismonarchy and the Bonapartist empire differed clearly andsharply from each other, in Germany Bismarck gave models of a “combination” of the two types, with those features which Marx called “military despotism” 140—to say nothing of Bonapartism—obviously predominating. 
 It is said that the carp likes to be fried in sour cream. 
 We don’t know whether the philistine likes to be “fried”in a bourgeois monarchy, in old feudal absolutism, in the “latest” type of Bonapartism or in military despotism, or, lastly, in a certain blend of all these “methods”. 
 But whilethe distinction may seem very small from the point ofview of the philistine and so-called “legal order”, i. 
e. 
,from a purely juridical, formally constitutional point of view, it is substantial from the point of view of the class struggle. 
 It won’t make things easier for the philistine to know that he is being beaten not only in the old way but in the new as well. 
 But the stability of a regime pressing down the philistine, the conditions of development and disintegra-tion of this regime, and its capacity to suffer a rapid fiasco *See present edition, Vol. 
 15, p. 
 349. 
— Ed. 
 all depend to a large degree on whether we are confronted with more or less evident, open, solid and direct forms of rule of definite classes, or with various indirect, unstable forms of their rule. 
 The rule of classes is harder to eliminate than the un-stable forms of the superstructure steeped in the shabbyspirit of old times and supported by a picked “electorate ‘. 
 The experiment of Sabler and Makarov in “organising” the priesthood for the Fourth Duma elections should be of considerable interest to everyone, both “sociologically”and in terms of practical politics.

 MILYUKOV ’S “POSITION ” The leader of the Cadet Party has lost his way in a wood of three trees. 
 He has been writing articles as long as Men-shikov’s about “three positions” and “one position”. 
 The more he writes, the more evident it becomes that he istrying to fool the reader with his talk, to cover up the point at issue with his dull and empty verbiage. 
 Poor learned historian! He has to pretend that he does not see the difference between liberalism and democracy. 
 For the whole point is this difference, gentlemen! The Duma votes in general, the attitude towards “reforms”, the voteson the budget, and the issue of “extra-parliamentary tactics”all bring out in different forms one and the same point , the profound difference between the liberal-monarchistbourgeoisie and the democrats. 
 For the thousand and first time, we shall briefly repeat what this difference is, for the benefit of the Milyukovswho “don’t understand”. 
 The liberals are defending a number of feudal-absolutist privileges (an upper chamber, etc. 
). 
 The democrats arewaging an uncompromising struggle against all privileges. 
 The liberals are for agreement with the forces of the old in social life; the democrats’ tactics are to eliminate theseforces. 
 The liberals are afraid of the independent activity of the masses, they do not trust it, they reject it; the democratssympathise with it, believe in it, support and encourage it. 
 That is enough for the moment. 
 Does Mr. 
 Milyukov really “not understand” this difference, which is familiar even from textbooks of history? Does he really “not understand” that the very programme of the Cadets is a programme of the liberal-monarchist bour-geoisie, not of the democrats, and that only liberals (and bad ones at that) could have voted for the budget in theThird Duma, could have declared themselves a loyal oppo-sition, etc. 
? Mr. 
 Milyukov understands this perfectly well, and he is trying to fool people with his talk, pretending that he has forgotten the ABC of the difference between liberalism and democracy. 
 To register in print this pitiful dodging of the Cadets, we shall remark to Mr. 
 Milyukov that in all the official Social-Democratic press (except, of course, that of the liqui-dators, whom we will gladly give up to Mr. 
 Milyukov), in all the resolutions of the guiding Social-Democratic bodies, and in the whole policy of the Social-Democrats in theThird Duma, we always and invariably meet, in thousandsof forms, with the defence of the old tactics which Mr. 
Milyukov says the Social-Democrats have abandoned. 
 It is an indisputable historical fact, esteemed learned historian! We must register in print how low the Cadets must have fallen if they try to deceive the public on questions whichare so elementary and have been made perfectly clear by thehistory of the political parties in Russia. 
 In conclusion, a little question to Mr. 
 Milyukov—to sum up and recapitulate what we have said: when you Cadet gentlemen agreed to bar Toiloshnikov from five session, 141 were you acting as liberals or as democrats? Pravda No.

 PETERSBURG WORKERS The proletariat of the capital is sending one of its elected representatives into the reactionary Duma of the landlordsand priests. 
 It is a glorious position this representative will hold. 
 He will have to speak and act on behalf of millions; he will have to unfurl a great banner; he will have to voicethe views that for years have been expressed in formal,specific, precise terms by the responsible spokesmen ofMarxism and working-class democracy. 
 The election of someone to that position is a matter of such vast importance that it would be petty, cowardly and disgraceful to be afraid to speak of it straightforwardly,without beating about the bush, to be afraid of “offending”a particular individual, a particular circle, etc. 
 The election should accord with the will of the majority of the class-conscious, Marxist workers. 
 That is obvious. 
 Nobody would venture to deny this outright . 
 Everyone knows that from 1908 to 1912 a fight was waged among the St. 
 Petersburg workers between the opponentsof liquidationism and the liquidators at hundreds and thou-sands of meetings, discussions and talks, and in variouspress organs. 
 It would be unseemly for anyone to bury his head in the sand like an ostrich and try to “forget” this fact. 
 Things are being muddled up by those who today are shouting about “unity” over the election of one deputy, for they are raising the wrong issue and obscuring the essential point by their shouting. 
 What has “unity” to do with it when it is necessary to elect one person and all are agreed that he must express the will of the majority of the class-conscious worker Marx-ists?? The liquidators are afraid to say plainly that they would like the choice to be a liquidator or a “non-factionalist” (i. 
e. 
, a waverer). 
 And since they are afraid to defend their views openly , they are trying to smuggle them through by deceit , by shouting about “unity”. 
 It is our duty to expose this confusion. 
 If the liquida-tors are in a majority among the class-conscious workers,no one on earth can prevent them from electing a liquidator. 
 We must establish as accurately, calmly, firmly, prudently and certainly as possible which side has the majority, with-out bothering about the outcries of people who, after five years of struggle , are advocating “unity” (a few days before the elections!) in order to conceal their views. 
 The workers are not children to believe a fairy-tale like that. 
 Only one of three possible decisions can be adopted: (1) to choose a liquidator; (2) to choose an opponent of liq-uidationism; (3) to choose a waverer. 
 There have been noothers among the Social-Democrats during the five yearsbetween 1908 and 1912, nor are there any today! Workers who want to act as adult and independent people must not tolerate political strike-breakers in their midst. 
 They must see to it that the will of the majority of class-conscious workers is respected and executed. 
 The workers need a deputy who will express the will of the majority and will know for certain what work he will carry out in and outside the Duma. 
 The will of the majority has been stated, and the deputy for St. 
 Petersburg should be a determined opponent of liqui-dationism and a supporter of consistent working-classdemocracy.

 For the whole of Eastern Europe, thehour is perhaps striking when the peoples themselves willhave their free and decisive word to say. 
 There is no longerroom for the game of the bourgeois “powers” and theirdiplomats who are past masters of intrigue, scheming and selfishly tripping up one another. 
 The Balkan peoples might say, as our serfs used to in the old days: “Save us from lordly anger and lordly love,the worst of all misfortunes. 
” 142 For the Balkan peasants and workers, both hostile and would-be friendly inter-vention by the European “powers” means only adding all sorts of fetters and hindrances to free progress to the gen-eral conditions of capitalist exploitation. 
 That is one reason why it is essential to fight against both bureaucratic-governmental and liberal “diplomacy”. 
Rech , for example, was false through and through when, a few days ago, it invited “Russian society” (i. 
e. 
, the bour-geoisie) to remember the statement of a British ministerial organ which said that Europe would not permit “misgovern-ment” in the Balkans! “Let our diplomats not sit back idly,”shouted Rech . 
 Even the most “liberal” bourgeois Europe, we say in reply, can bring the Balkans nothing but support for decay and stagnation, nothing but bureaucratic obstacles to free-dom. 
 It is “Europe” that is hindering the establishmentof a federal republic in the Balkans.

 It is impor-tant for all democrats in general and for the working class in particular to understand the class interests guiding this or that party in this matter. 
 The policy of the Octobrists, nationalists and unaffili-ated “patriots”, from Novoye Vremya to Russkoye Slovo , is clear and simple. 
 The badgering of Austria, incitement towar against her, and shouts about the “Slav tasks” of Russia are a poorly disguised endeavour to divert attention from Russia’s domestic affairs and to “grab a piece” of Turkey. 
Support for reaction at home and for colonial, imperialistplunder abroad—such is the essence of this crude “patri-otic” “Slav” policy. 
 The Cadets’ policy is couched in more subtle and diplo-matic terms, but in effect their policy is also a reactiona-ry great-power policy of imperialism . 
 It is particularly im-portant to understand this, for the liberals cunningly veiltheir views with democratic-sounding phrases. 
 Look at Rech . 
 At first—prior to the “love tryst” of Milyu-kov and Sazonov 143—it accused Sazonov of “readiness to bargain” and reproached the nationalists with weakening the “great idea” of capturing Constantinople. 
 But now,after the tryst, Rech agrees with Rossiya , vigorously censur-ing the “foolish enthusiasm” of Novoye Vremya . 
 But what is the policy of Rech today? We must not begin with proud demands, for if we do we shall lose support (from France and Britain), and shall “end by becoming, in spite of ourselves, even more modest than we should be ” (No. 
 278)!! And so, Rech is against the chauvinists because they “will end by being more modest than they should be”. 
 It is as much as to say: you chauvinists are bragging and you’ll get nothing. 
 But we are in favour of grabbing a big chunkquietly and peacefully, with the support of the French andBritish bourgeoisie! “We need” support (from the Triple Entente) “in the interests of our own Balkan protégés ”, writes Rech . 
 Mark this: Rech , too, favours the idea of Russia “ protecting ” the Slavs, of the fox protecting the hen-coop, except thatit wants this done more cunningly! “All that can be achieved has to be achieved only in this way— through the joint efforts of European diplomacy,” declares Rech . 
 It is clear enough: the essence of Cadet policy is the same kind of chauvinism and imperialism as that of Novoye Vremya , only more cunning and subtle. 
 Novoye Vremya roughly and stupidly threatens war on behalf of Russia alone. 
 Rech , “subtly and diplomatically”, likewise threatens war , but only on behalf of the Triple Entente, far to say “we must not be more modest than we should be” meansprecisely threatening war. 
 Novoye Vremya is in favour of the Slavs being protected by Russia , while Rech favours their protection by the Triple Entente. 
 In other words, Novoye Vremya wants to see only our fox in the hen-coop, while Rech favours an agreement among three foxes. 
 Democrats in general and workers in particular are op-posed to all “protection” of the Slavs by foxes or wolves,and advocate the complete self-determination of nations, complete democracy, and the liberation of the Slavs from all protection by the “Great Powers”. 
 The liberals and nationalists are arguing about differ-ent ways of plundering and enslaving the Balkan peoples by the European bourgeoisie.

 Petersburg City Coun-cil on October 10 has attracted public attention. 
 The resolution concerns the Balkan war, the most impor-tant event in world politics, and it comes from an influential public body—influential among the bourgeoisie. 
 It wasadopted unanimously by avowed reactionaries and by liberals. 
 Falbork, a liberal, and all but a “democrat” (!?) and Cadet, urged the necessity of that kind of resolution in an“ardent speech”; he was a member of the drafting commis-sion, and voted for the resolution. 
 This resolution is a specimen of bourgeois chauvinism, of the bourgeoisie’s abject servility to “the powers thatbe”, of bourgeois support for a policy which turns the peo-ples into cannon fodder. 
 “St. 
 Petersburg,” says the resolution, which is addressed to the capitals of the belligerent Balkan powers, “shares your hope of abright future of independent liberty for the oppressed peoples, aliberty in whose name you are shedding your blood. 
” This is the sort of phrases that chauvinism hides behind! Never and nowhere has “liberty” been won by the oppressedpeoples through one people waging war against another. 
 Wars between peoples merely increase the enslavement of peoples. 
 Real liberty for the Slav peasant in the Balkans, as well as for the Turkish peasant, can be ensured only b y complete liberty inside every country and by a federation of completely and thoroughly democratic states. 
 The Slav and the Turkish peasants in the Balkans are brothers who are equally “oppressed” by their landlords and their governments. 
 That is where real oppression lies, and the real obstacle to “independence” and “liberty”. 
 The reactionary and liberal chauvinists, who are openly making common cause in the St.

 to the Pravda text TWO UTOPIAS Utopia is a Greek word, composed of ou, not, and topos , a place. 
 It means a place which does not exist, a fantasy,invention or fairy-tale. 
 In politics utopia is a wish that can never come true— neither now nor afterwards, a wish that is not based onsocial forces and is not supported by the growth and devel-opment of political, class forces. 
 The less freedom there is in a country, the scantier themanifestations of open class struggle and the lower the educational level of the masses , the more easily political utopias usually arise and the longer they persist. 
 In modern Russia, two kinds of political utopia have been most persistent and they exert a certain influence onthe masses owing to their appeal. 
 They are the liberal uto-pia and the Narodnik utopia. 
 The liberal utopia alleges that one could bring about appreciable improvements in Russia, in her political lib-erty, and in the condition of the mass of her workingpeople, peacefully and harmoniously, without hurting any-one’s feelings, without removing the Purishkeviches, with-out a ruthless class struggle fought to a finish. 
 It is the utopia of peace between a free Russia and the Purishke-viches. 
 The Narodnik utopia is a dream of the Narodnik intel-lectuals and Trudovik peasants who imagine that a newand just division of the land could abolish the power and rule of capital and do away with wage slavery, or that a “just”, “equalised” division of the land could be maintained under the domination of capital, under the rule of money,under commodity production. 
 What is it that gives rise to these utopias? Why do they persist rather strongly in present-day Russia? They are engendered by the interests of the classes which are waging a struggle against the old order, serfdom, lackof rights—in a word, “against the Purishkeviches”, andwhich do not occupy an independent position in this struggle. 
Utopia, or day-dreaming, is a product of this lack of independ-ence, this weakness . 
 Day-dreaming is the lot of the weak . 
 The liberal bourgeoisie in general, and the liberal-bour-geois intelligentsia in particular, cannot but strive forliberty and legality, since without these the dominationof the bourgeoisie is incomplete, is neither undivided norguaranteed. 
 But the bourgeoisie is more afraid of the move-ment of the masses than of reaction. 
 Hence the striking, incredible weakness of the liberals in politics, their abso-lute impotence. 
 Hence the endless series of equivocations,falsehoods, hypocrisies and cowardly evasions in the entirepolicy of the liberals, who have to play at democracy to win the support of the masses but at the same time are deep-ly anti-democratic, deeply hostile to the movement of the masses, to their initiative, their way of “storming heaven”, as Marx once described one of the mass movements in Euro-pe in the last century. 
 144 The utopia of liberalism is a utopia of impotence in the matter of the political emancipation of Russia, a utopiaof the self-interested moneybags who want “peacefully” to share privileges with the Purishkeviches and pass off this noble desire as the theory of “peaceful” victory for Russiandemocracy. 
 The liberal utopia means day-dreaming abouthow to beat the Purishkeviches without defeating them,how to break them without hurting them. 
 Clearly, this utopia is harmful not only because it is a utopia, but also because it corrupts the democratic consciousness of the masses. 
 If they believe in this utopia, the masses will never win freedom; they are not worthy of freedom; they fullydeserve to be maltreated by the Purishkeviches. 
 The utopia of the Narodniks and Trudoviks is the day-dreaming of the petty proprietor, who stands midway be-tween the capitalist and the wage-worker, about abolishing wage slavery without a class struggle. 
 When the issue ofeconomic emancipation becomes as close, immediate and burning for Russia as the issue of political emancipation is today, the utopia of the Narodniks will prove no less harm-ful than that of the liberals. 
 But Russia is still in the period of her bourgeois and not proletarian transformation; it is not the question ofthe economic emancipation of the proletariat that has most completely matured, but the question of political liberty, i. 
e. 
 (in effect), of complete bourgeois liberty. 
 And in this latter question, the Narodnik utopia plays a peculiar historical role. 
 Being a utopia in regard to theeconomic consequences that a new division of the landshould (and would) have, it is an accompaniment and symp-tom of the great, mass democratic upsurge of the peasant masses, i. 
e. 
, the masses that constitute the majority of the population in bourgeois-feudal, modern, Russia. 
 (In a purely bourgeois Russia, as in purely bourgeois Europe, thepeasantry will not form the majority of the population. 
) The liberal utopia corrupts the democratic conscious-ness of the masses. 
 The Narodnik utopia, which corruptstheir socialist consciousness, is an accompaniment, a symp-tom, and in part even an expression of their democratic upsurge. 
 The dialectics of history is such that the Narodniks and the Trudoviks propose and promote, as an anti-capitalistremedy, a highly consistent and thoroughgoing capitalistmeasure with regard to the agrarian question in Russia. 
 An “equalised” new division of the land is utopian, yet a most complete rupture—a rupture indispensable for a new di-vision—with the whole of the old landownership, whetherlandlord, allotment or “crown”, is the most necessary,economically progressive and, for a state like Russia, mosturgent measure towards bourgeois democracy. 
 We should remember Engels’s notable dictum: “What formally may he economically incorrect, may all the same be correct from the point of view of world his-tory. 
” 145 Engels advanced this profound thesis in connection with utopian socialism: that socialism was “fallacious” in the formal economic sense. 
 That socialism was “fallacious” when it declared surplus value an injustice from the point of view of the laws of exchange. 
 The theoreticians of bour-geois political economy were right, in objecting to that socialism, in the formal economic sense, for surplus value results from the laws of exchange quite “naturally”, quite “justly”. 
 But utopian socialism was right from the point of view of world history, for it was a symptom, an expression, a har-binger of the class which, born of capitalism, has by now, inthe beginning of the twentieth century, become a mass force which can put an end to capitalism and is irresistibly ad-vancing to this goal. 
 Engels’s profound thesis must be borne in mind when appraising the present-day Narodnik or Trudovik utopiain Russia (perhaps not only in Russia but in a number ofAsiatic countries going through bourgeois revolutions in the twentieth century). 
 . 
 Narodnik democracy , while fallacious from the formal economic point of view, is correct from the historical point of view; this democracy, while fallacious as a socialist utopia, is correct in terms of the peculiar, historically conditioned democratic struggle of the peasant masses which is an inseparable element of the bourgeois transformation and a condition for its complete victory. 
 The liberal utopia discourages the peasant masses from fighting. 
 The Narodnik utopia expresses their aspiration tofight, and promises them a million blessings in the event ofvictory, while this victory will in fact yield them only a hundred blessings. 
 But is it not natural that the millions who are marching to battle, who for ages have lived inunheard-of ignorance, want, poverty, squalor, abandonmentand downtroddenness, should magnify tenfold the fruits ofan eventual victory? The liberal utopia is a veil for the self-seeking desire of the new exploiters to share in the privileges of the old exploiters. 
 The Narodnik utopia is an expression of theaspiration of the toiling millions of the petty bourgeoisieto put an end altogether to the old, feudal exploiters, but it also expresses the false hope that the new, capitalist exploit-ers can be abolished along with them. 
 Clearly, the Marxists, who are hostile to all and every utopia, must uphold the independence of the class which can fight feudalism with supreme devotion precisely because it is not even one-hundredth part involved in property owner-ship which makes the bourgeoisie a half-hearted opponent,and often an ally, of the feudal lords. 
 The peasants areinvolved in small commodity production; given a favour-able conjuncture of historical circumstances, they can achieve the most complete abolition of feudalism, but they will always —inevitably and not accidentally—show a certain vacillation between the bourgeoisie and the pro-letariat, between liberalism and Marxism. 
 Clearly, the Marxists must carefully extract the sound and valuable kernel of the sincere, resolute, militant de-mocracy of the peasant masses from the husk of Narodnik utopias. 
 In the old Marxist literature of the eighties one can dis-cover systematic effort to extract this valuable democratickernel. 
 Some day historians will study this effort systemat-ically and trace its connection with what in the first decade of the twentieth century came to be called “Bolshevism”.

 DEBATES IN BRITAIN ON LIBERAL LABOUR POLICY It is well known that in Britain there are two workers’ parties: the British Socialist Party, as the Social-Demo-crats now call themselves, and the so-called Independent Labour Party. 
 This split in the British workers’ socialist movement is no accident. 
 It originated long ago. 
 It arose out of thespecific features of British history. 
 Capitalism developedin Britain before it did in any other country, and for a longtime Britain was the “workshop” of the world. 
 This excep-tional, monopoly position created relatively tolerable con-ditions of life for the labour aristocracy , i. 
e. 
, for the minority of skilled, well-paid workers in Britain. 
 Hence the petty-bourgeois, craft spirit in the ranks of this labour aristocracy, which has been divorcing itself fromits class, following in the wake of the Liberals, and treat-ing socialism contemptuously as a “utopia”. 
 The Independ-ent Labour Party is a party of liberal labour policy. 
 It isjustly said that this Party is “independent” only of social-ism, but very dependent on liberalism. 
 In recent times Britain’s monopoly has been thoroughly undermined. 
 The previous relatively tolerable conditions of life have given way to extreme want as a consequence of the high cost of living. 
 The class struggle is becoming immenselyintensified, and along with this the basis for opportunism,the former basis for the spread of the ideas of liberal labourpolicy among the working class, is being undermined. 
 So long as these ideas persisted among considerable numbers of British workers, elimination of the split among the workers was out of the question. 
 Unity cannot be created by phrases and desires, so long as the Social-Democrats have to fight against liberal labour policy. 
 At the present time , however, this unity is really becoming possible, be-cause the protest against liberal labour policy is growing in the Independent Labour Party itself . 
 Before us lies the official report of the latest, Twen-tieth, Annual Conference of that Party, held at Merthyr onMay 27 and 28, 1912. 
 The debate on parliamentary policygiven in the report is extremely interesting; essentially it was a debate on a deeper issue, that of Social-Democratic and liberal labour policies, although the speakers did notuse these terms. 
 The Conference debate was opened by Jowett, M. 
P. 
 He moved a resolution against supporting the Liberals, of whichwe shall speak in greater detail below, and a fellow-thinker, Conway, who seconded the motion, said plainly: “The aver-age worker is asking the question whether the Labour Partyin Parliament has a view of its own. 
” Suspicion is growingamong the workers that the Labour Party is “tied” to theLiberals. 
 “A feeling is growing in the country that theLabour Party is simply a wing of the Liberal Party. 
” It should be observed that the Parliamentary Labour Party consists not only of I. 
L. 
P. 
 M. 
P. 
s, but also of M. 
P. 
s spon-sored by trade unions. 
 These call themselves Labour M. 
P. 
sand Labour Party members, and do not belong to the I. 
L. 
P. 
 The British opportunists have succeeded in doing what theopportunists in other countries are frequently inclined to do, namely, in combining opportunist “socialist” M. 
P. 
s with the M. 
P. 
s of allegedly non-party trade unions. 
 The notori-ous “broad labour party”, of which certain Mensheviksspoke in Russia in 1906-07, has materialised in Britain, andonly in Britain. 
 To give practical expression to his views, Jowett moved a resolution, drawn up in the truly “British” manner, that is, without any general principles (the British pride them-selves on their “practicality” and their dislike for generalprinciples; this is just another expression of the craft spiritin the labour movement). 
 The resolution called on theLabour group in the House of Commons to ignore all threats that the Liberal government might find itself in a minority and so be compelled to resign, and to vote steadfastly on the merits of the questions brought before them . 
 Jowett’s motion “took the bull by the horns”. 
 The Li-beral Cabinet in Britain, like the entire Liberal Party, is doing its utmost to persuade the workers that all forces must be united against reaction (i. 
e. 
, against the Conserva-tive Party), that the Liberal majority must be preserved,for it may melt away if the workers do not vote with theLiberals, and that the workers must not isolate themselvesbut must support the Liberals. 
 And so Jowett puts the ques-tion clearly: vote “steadfastly”, ignore the threat that the Liberal government may fall, do not vote as the interests ofthe Liberal Party require it, but on the merits of the ques-tions, i. 
e. 
, in Marxist language—pursue an independentproletarian class policy and not a liberal labour policy. 
 (In the ranks of the Independent Labour Party, Marxism is rejected on principle , and that is why Marxist language is not used at all. 
) The opportunists, who predominate in the Party, imme-diately attacked Jowett. 
 And—characteristically—they didit exactly as opportunists, in a roundabout way, by an eva-sion. 
 They did not want to say plainly that they were in favour of supporting the Liberals. 
 They expressed their idea in general phrases , and, of course, did not fail to men-tion the “Independence” of the working class. 
 Just like ourliquidators, who always shout especially loudly aboutthe “independence” of the working class whenever they arein fact preparing to replace its independence by a liberal labour policy. 
 Murray, the representative of the opportunist majority, moved an amendment, i. 
e. 
, counter-resolution, as follows: “That this Conference recognises that the Labour Party, in order to effectually carry out its object, must continue to regard all thepossible consequences and effects, immediate and otherwise, of any line of action before adopting it, bearing in mind that its decisions must be guided solely by consideration for its own interest as a party,and by desire to increase its opportunities for attaining its ends. 
” Compare the two motions. 
 Jowett’s motion clearly de-manded a break with the policy of supporting the Liberals. 
Murray’s consisted of meaningless commonplaces, quite plausible and at first sight indisputable, but in fact serv-ing to disguise precisely the policy of supporting the Lib-erals. 
 Had Murray been acquainted with Marx, and had he been speaking to people who respected Marxism, he would have thought nothing of sweetening his opportunism with Marxist turns of speech and saying that Marxism demands that all the concrete circumstances of each particular caseshould be taken into consideration, that we must not tieour hands, that while preserving our independence we “takeadvantage of conflicts”, “seize at the Achilles heel of thecontradictions” in the present regime, and so on and so forth. 
 Opportunism can be expressed in terms of any doctrine you like , including Marxism . 
 The peculiarity of the “desti-ny of Marxism” in Russia lies precisely in the fact that notonly opportunism in the workers’ party, but also opportun-ism in the liberal party (Izgoyev and Co. 
), likes to dressitself in Marxist “ terms ”! But that is by the way. 
 Let us return to Merthyr. 
 Jowett was supported by McLachlan. 
 “What are the interests of a political party?” he asked. 
 “Are the interests of the party merely to be served by retaining men in theHouse of Commons? If the interests of the party are to be considered,then the men and women who are outside Parliament have as muchright to be considered as the men in Parliament. 
 As a socialist organ-isation we should try to give effect to our principles in our political activities. 
” And McLachlan referred to the vote on the Heswell Reformatory case. 
 A boy inmate of the reformatory had beentortured to death. 
 A question was asked in Parliament. 
 The Liberal Cabinet was threatened with defeat: Britain is not Prussia, and a Cabinet that is in the minority must resign. 
And so, to save the Cabinet, the Labour M. 
P. 
s voted infavour of whitewashing the torturer. 
 The Labour Party, said McLachlan, keeps on taking into account the effect which their vote might have on the fate of the government, thinking that should the Cabinet fall, Parliament would be dissolved and a new general electionannounced. 
 But that was nothing to be afraid of. 
 The fallof the Cabinet and the announcement of new elections wouldresult in a combination of the two bourgeois parties (McLach-lan simply said: the “other two parties”, without the word “bourgeois”. 
 The British do not like Marxist terms!), and the sooner that happened , the better for our movement . 
 The words of our propagandists should be carried into effect by the work of our men in the House. 
 Until that was done, the Tory (i. 
e. 
, Conservative) workman would never believe there was any difference between the Liberal and Labour Par-ties. 
 Even if we lost every seat in the House through uphold-ing our principles, it would do more good than attempts to coax a Liberal government into making concessions! Keir Hardie, M. 
P. 
, the Party leader, twists and turns. 
 “It is not true to say that the Labour Party upholds the balance of power. 
 The Liberals and Irishmen in the House can outvote the Tory and Labour members .... 
 In the case of the Heswell Reformatory I voted for the government purely on the merits of the case, and not in support of the government. 
 The superintendent had been guilty of harshness and cruelty, and every Labour member went to theHouse determined to vote against the government. 
 But during the debate the other side was put, and it showed that although the supe-rintendent had been guilty of cruel treatment, the record of the Schoolwas the best in the Kingdom. 
 Under those circumstances it would have been wrong to vote against the government .... 
 [Such is the pass to which the British opportunists have brought the LabourParty: the leader was not howled down for that sort of speech, but was listened to calmly!] “The real trouble is not with the I. 
L. 
P. 
 members, but that when the Labour Party took over the Miners’ Federation, and the miners’ members joined the Labour group, they were Liberals , and they have not changed their opinions, since they gave a purely nominal adher-ence to the Party.... 
 “Jowett’s resolution reduces Parliamentary government to ab-surdity. 
 The consequences of any vote must be considered.... 
 “I would advise the previous question as regards both the resolu-tion and the amendment. 
” (!!!) Lansbury, supporting Jowett’s resolution, said: “It is not so foolish as Keir Hardie would have us suppose. 
 It does not mean that in voting upon a question every considerationshould be ignored but only the consideration as to what effect it would have on the government. 
 I got into the socialist movement through sheer disgust with political caucuses and bosses, and the controlof the House of Commons by such people. 
 My experience has beenthat every question that comes up for discussion has to be discussedin regard to its probable effect on the fortunes of the government ofthe day. 
 “It makes it almost impossible for the Labour Party to differen-tiate itself from the Liberal Party. 
 I do not know of any particularpiece of legislation in connection with which the Labour Party hasin any kind of way differentiated itself from the Liberals. 
 We as aparty were part and parcel of the government in regard to the Insur-ance Act .... 
 The Labour Party voted steadily for the Bill, and stood by the government all the way through. 
 “I was ashamed of the vote over the Heswell Reformatory. 
 When a man poured boiling water over a boy until he died I felt ashamed of ... voting for the whitewashing of that man. 
 On that occasion the Labour Party whips ran about the House bringing up their men toprevent the government being defeated .... 
 To accustom men ... to voting against their consciences is deadly for the future of democ-racy in this country.... 
” Philip Snowden, M. 
P. 
, one of the most rabid opportunists, wriggled like an eel. 
 He said: “My fighting instinct inclines me to support the resolution, but my common sense, judgement, and experience induce me to votefor the amendment. 
 I agree that the present Parliamentary system has a demoralising effect upon those who went to the House moved by idealism and political enthusiasm. 
 But I do not believe the adop-tion of Jowett’s resolution will make much difference. 
 The merits of a question are not confined to the particular question itself. 
 There are certain issues which the Labour Party considers of greater impor-tance than any possible consequences of voting for the government —Women’s Suffrage is one—but are we to disregard consequences on every paltry issue? This policy would necessitate repeated GeneralElections and nothing is more irritating to the public than such con-tests.... 
 Politics means compromise. 
” When a vote was taken, 73 voted for the resolution and 195 against . 
 The opportunists carried the day. 
 That is not surpris-ing in an opportunist party like the British I. 
L. 
P. 
 But it is now a fully established fact that opportunism is givingrise to an opposition in the ranks of this very Party. 
 The opponents of opportunism acted far more correctly than their like-minded colleagues in Germany frequently dowhen they defend rotten compromises with the opportunists. 
 The fact that they came out openly with their resolution gave rise to an extremely important debate on principles,and this debate will have a very strong effect on the Britishworking class. 
 Liberal labour policy persists owing totradition, routine and the agility of opportunist leaders. 
But its bankruptcy among the mass of the proletariat is inevitable.

 A CADET PROFESSOR Professor Tugan-Baranovsky, a candidate of the Cadet Party, is one of those Russian economists who were near-Marxists in their youth but later quickly “grew wiser”, “corrected” Marx with shreds of bourgeois theories, and by their great services as renegades secured universitychairs from which to bamboozle students in erudite fashion. 
 A few days ago Mr. 
 Tugan, who has developed from a Marxist into a liberal, dished up in the newspaper Rech the following argument concerning the burning issue of the high cost of living: “In my [?] view, the main [aha!] reason for the increased cost of living is perfectly clear. 
 It is due to the enormous growth of thepopulation, chiefly in the towns. 
 The increased population necessi-tates a change to the use of more intensive cultivation methods whichin accordance with the well-known law of declining productivity o f agricultural labour, leads to a higher labour cost per unit of product. 
” Mr. 
 Tugan likes to shout “I” and “my”. 
 But in fact he merely repeats shreds of bourgeois doctrines refuted longago by Marx. 
 The “well-known law of declining productivity” is a bit of old bourgeois rubbish, which ignoramuses and thehired scholars of the bourgeoisie use to justify capitalism . 
 Marx long ago disproved this “law”, which puts the blame onnature (as if to say, productivity of labour is dropping, and there’s nothing to be done about it!), whereas in fact the blame lies with the capitalist social system. 
 The “law of declining productivity of agricultural labour” is a bourgeois lie. 
 The law of the growth of rent , i. 
e. 
, of the income of the owners of land, under capitalism is a reality. 
 One reason for the high cost of living is land monopoly, i. 
e. 
, the fact that land is held as private property. 
 The landowners are therefore taking an ever greater contribution from growing productivity of labour. 
 Only the organisation of the workers to defend their interests, only the aboli-tion of the capitalist mode of production, can put an endto the high cost of living. 
 None but hangers-on of the bourgeoisie, such as the Ca-det Mr. 
 Tugan, are capable of trying to defend the fable about the “law” of declining productivity of agriculturallabour.

 to the Pravda text A NEW CHAPTER OF WORLD HISTORY Even the bourgeois press throughout Europe, which for reactionary and selfish reasons defended the notoriousstatus quo in the Balkans, is now unanimous in acknowledg-ing that a new chapter of world history has begun. 
 The defeat of Turkey is beyond question. 
 The victories won by the Balkan states united in a quadruple alliance(Serbia, Bulgaria, Montenegro and Greece) are tremendous. 
The alliance of these four states is a fact. 
 “The Balkans forthe Balkan peoples” is something that has already been achieved. 
 What, then, is the significance of the new chapter of world history? In Eastern Europe (Austria, the Balkans, Russia), the powerful survivals of medievalism, which terribly hampersocial development and the growth of the proletariat, have not yet been abolished. 
 These survivals are absolutism (unlimited autocratic power), feudalism (landlordism andfeudal privileges) and the suppression of nationalities. 
 The class-conscious workers of the Balkan countries are the first to put forward the slogan of a consistently demo-cratic solution of the national problem in the Balkans. 
 That slogan calls for a Balkan federal republic. 
 The weakness of the democratic classes in the present-day Balkan states(where the proletariat is small in number and the peasantsare downtrodden, disunited and illiterate) has resulted inan economically and politically indispensable alliance be-coming an alliance of Balkan monarchies. 
 The national question in the Balkans has taken a big stride towards its settlement. 
 Of all the states of EasternEurope, Russia alone remains the most backward today. 
 Although the alliance which has come into being in the Balkans is an alliance of monarchies and not of republics, and although this alliance has come about through war and not through revolution, a great step has nevertheless beentaken towards doing away with the survivals of medievalismthroughout Eastern Europe. 
 And you are rejoicing prema-turely, nationalist gentlemen! That step is against you, for there are more survivals of medievalism in Russia than anywhere else ! As for Western Europe, the proletariat there is still more vigorously proclaiming the slogan: No intervention! TheBalkans for the Balkan peoples! Pravda No.

 to the Pravda text CADETS AND NATIONALISTS When we pointed out that the Cadets were essentially national-liberals in their outlook and that their approachto the national question was anything but democratic , we got an angry and haughty retort from Rech , which accused us of not knowing the facts or misrepresenting them. 
 Here is a record—one of many. 
 Let the readers and voters judge for themselves. 
 On October 18 a “circle of persons interested in the Slav question” held a second meeting at Mr. 
 M. 
 M. 
 Kovalevsky’s. 
An appeal to society was read, signed by Y. 
 Anichkov. 
 Kareyev, L. 
 Panteleyev (Cadet ex-candidate), G. 
 Falbork. 
 Mr. 
 Kovalevsky (of course) and others. 
 Will Rech try to dodge responsibility for Kareyev, Pan-teleyev and Co. 
? The gist of the liberals’ appeal to society is that “amidst general enthusiasm , the hearts of the Russians ... are beat-ing in sympathy for the Slavs and with the hope that Russian na-tional consciousness will help to ensure that they retain the fruits or their victories”. 
 In what way does this differ from the nationalism and chauvinism of Novoye Vremya and Co. 
? Only in that it has white gloves on and that the turns of speech used in it are more diplomatically cautious. 
 But chauvinism is abominable even when wearing white gloves and using the most refinedturns of speech. 
 Democrats will never speak of “general enthusiasm” when beside (and above!) them are Russian nationalists ruth-lessly oppressing a number of peoples. 
 Democrats will never stand for the Slav as such being contrasted with the Turk, whereas one should contrast the Slav and Turkish peasants, together , with the Slav and Turkish landlords and bashi-bazouks. 
 Democrats will never allow “Russian national conscious-ness” to be substituted for the political consciousness of the partisans of freedom and enemies of oppression in all na-tionalities—at a time when Poles, Jews, and “non-Rus-sians” in general are oppressed and persecuted. 
 No fair-minded democrat, no sincere supporter of the oppressed nationalities, should vote for the Cadets! Pravda No.

 Correspondents are deceived and held up,and are not allowed on the battlefield until long after bat-tles have come to an end. 
 That is why only exceptional circumstances enable one at rare intervals to learn the truth about the war. 
 Apparent-ly, such exceptional circumstances helped Mr. 
 Donohoe,a correspondent of the British Daily Chronicle . 
 He succeed-ed in being with the Turkish Army during the battle at Lule Burgaz; then he drove by car to Constantinople, and from there went by sea to Constanta in Rumania. 
 FromConstanta he was able to wire London without hindrance. 
 The Turks suffered a terrible defeat. 
 Up to 40,000 (!) of them fell in battle. 
 A catastrophe not less than thatat Mukden, 146 wrote the British correspondent. 
 Three-quar-ters of the Turkish artillery passed into Bulgarian hands. 
 The Bulgarians would let the Turks come up very close andengage in a hand-to-hand combat, and then would swiftlywithdraw while their machine-guns mowed the Turks down in hundreds and thousands. 
 The Turks’ retreat became a disorderly flight of stupe-fied, starving, exhausted and maddened mobs. 
 The cor-respondent’s car got stuck in a crowd of fugitives.

 to the Pravda text THE CADETS AND THE BIG BOURGEOISIE The Cadet victories in the first city curias of Moscow and St. 
 Petersburg, then in the elections to the Council of Statefrom the industries, and lastly, the reactionaries ’ aid to the Cadets against the Social-Democrats—a fact estab-lished beyond question—are all signs of a very interestingpolitical development of all the classes of our society. 
 Let us recall the Social-Democrats’ main decision on the nature of the Cadet Party, adopted in 1907: “The parties ofthe liberal-monarchist bourgeoisie, and the most important of them—the Cadet Party—have already turned definitely away from the revolution and aim at stopping it througha deal with the counter-revolution; the social basis of theseparties is made up of the economically more progressivesections of the bourgeoisie, above all the bourgeois intel-ligentsia, while a section of the urban and rural petty bour-geoisie is still following these parties only by force of tradi-tion [blind habit] and because it is simply deceived bythe liberals. 
” The correctness of this description has been fully borne out by events. 
 The democrats are ousting the Cadets fromthe second city curia (where there are many democratic voters). 
 The Cadets are ousting the Octobrists from the first urban curia. 
 The more the reaction rages and the more openly the elections are rigged, the more big capital goes over to theside of liberalism. 
 The class nature of the Cadet Party,indicated by the Marxists in 1906 and 1907, is now being revealed clearly before the masses. 
 The error of those who considered the Cadets a party of urban democrats is becoming obvious. 
 The alliance of the Cadets and the reactionaries is gradually turning from a secret into an open one: it is the reactionaries who are voting the Cadet Mansyrev in against the Social-Democrat Priedkalns, and the Cadet Nikolayev against the Social-Democrat Pokrovsky. 
 The strength of Social-Democratic policy, the invinci-bility of this policy, is due to the fact that the entire de-velopment of capitalist society is increasingly proving it correct. 
 The Cadets are rallying to the big bourgeoisie, which cannot be content for all that it is counter-revolu-tionary. 
 The democrats are moving to the left, away from the Cadets.

 157, November 1, 1912 Published according to the Pravda text TRULY RUSSIAN MORALS A few days ago the newspaper Zemshchina carried, along with verses by Purishkevich, a little article concerningthe “famous” official publicist Guryev of Rossiya (who from now on will be famous without inverted commas). 
 Zemshchina assures its readers that he is a “publicist of a Jewish-liberal shade”. 
 How strange! Is it possible that theofficial Rossiya , too, is a Jewish-liberal organ? But what is the point? It is that Guryev has been unan-imously expelled from the board of a St. 
 Petersburg spin-ning mill by the general meeting of its shareholders. 
 In addition, the meeting resolved to request the procurator to start proceedings against Guryev for his irregular practices. 
 It appears that Guryev contributed 1,000 rubles and ac-quired the right to one-third of the profits, although two co-owners of the mill had contributed 100,000 rubles! Whythis generous treatment of Guryev by the capitalists? Because that gentleman is a councillor of state, a contrib-utor to the official newspaper Rossiya , and so on and so forth. 
 He was Witte’s private secretary. 
 He has “excep-tional connections”. 
 He promised government subsidies ! And so, the capitalist gentlemen “valued” those govern-ment “connections” fairly highly: 49,000 rubles exactly. 
 You have the goods, we have the money. 
 You have “con-nections in government quarters”, an opportunity of obtain-ing subsidies, we have money. 
 Sale and purchase. 
 “Con-nections in government quarters”, so-and-so many thou-sands; a promise of subsidies, so-and-so much; contributionsto the official Rossiya , so-and-so much. 
 Collect your money, Mr. 
 Guryev! Guryev collected it—and fooled them. 
 He did not keep his promises but claimed over one-third of the profits and, what is more, resorted to blackmail, i. 
e. 
, to extorting money under threat of undermining the credit of the establish-ment. 
 A characteristic affair. 
 A typical affair. 
 An everyday occur-rence. 
 An illustration to the theme, Government connec-tions and subsidies, and their relation to capital”.

 to the Pravda text THE PLATFORM OF THE REFORMISTS AND THE PLATFORM OF THE REVOLUTIONARY SOCIAL-DEMOCRATS The revolutionary upswing in Russia made itself clearly felt in the first half of 1912. 
 The number of political strikers, as calculated by the factory owners, reached 515,000 forfive months. 
 A particularly important document, reprintedin full in No. 
 27 of the Central Organ, namely, the May Dayappeal of the St. 
 Petersburg workers, provides evidence asto the nature of the strikers’ slogans, their demands, the political content of their demonstrations, meetings, etc. 
 The slogans with which the St. 
 Petersburg workers came forward in those memorable days were not reformist butrevolutionary Social-Democratic slogans: a constituent as-sembly, an eight-hour working day, confiscation of the land-ed estates, the overthrow of the tsarist government, and a democratic republic. 
 The revolts and attempted revolts of soldiers and sail-ors—in Turkestan, in the Baltic Fleet and on the BlackSea—supplied fresh objective evidence that after long years of rampant counter-revolution and of a lull in the working-class movement, a new revolutionary upswing had begun. 
 This upswing coincided with the period of the elections to the Fourth Duma, when all parties and all politicaltrends had to present, in one form or another, their gen-eral appraisal of the political situation. 
 Now, if we want to analyse our political tasks seriously, as the tasks of theworking class and not the pious wishes of little groups, and if we want to test programmes and platforms in a Marxist way by comparing them with the facts of the mass struggleand with the actions of all the classes of this society, we must also test the various election platforms on the touch-stone of this revolutionary upswing of the masses. 
 For, as far as the Social-Democrats are concerned, elections are not a special political operation, not an attempt to win seatsthrough all sorts of promises and declarations, but merely aspecial occasion for advocating the basic demands andthe principles of the political world outlook of the class-conscious proletariat. 
 The programmes and platforms of all the government parties, from the Black Hundreds to Guchkov, leave noroom for doubt. 
 They are plainly and openly counter-revo-lutionary. 
 It is common knowledge that these parties lacka foothold of any real importance not only among the work-ing class and the peasantry, but even among wide sections of the bourgeoisie. 
 These sections have almost completely turned away from the Octobrists. 
 The programmes and platforms of the liberal bourgeois parties have been published in part almost officially (theplatform of the Moslem group) and are partly known quiteaccurately through the “big” political press (the platforms of the “Progressists” and of the Cadets). 
 The essence of all these programmes and platforms has been inimitably ex-pressed in the declarations of the garrulous Cadet, Gredes-kul, which were reprinted in Rech and from there found their way into the Marxist press. 
 “A public denial of the need for a new revolution in Rus-sia” is how Gredeskul himself formulated his views (cf. 
 Sotsial-Demokrat No. 
 27, p. 
 3). 
 It was he, too, who contrast-ed the real platform of the liberals (with the Cadets at their head) with that of the revolutionaries, saving that “what weneed is merely quiet, persevering and confident constitu-tional work”. 
 We stress the words “real platform”, for in Russia, as in all bourgeois countries, most platforms are mere window dressing . 
 The crux of the matter is what was admitted (in a rare fit of truthfulness) by Mr. 
 Gredeskul. 
 The liberal monarchistbourgeoisie is opposed to a new revolution and advocates only constitutional reforms. 
 The Social-Democrats consistently, and the bourgeois democrats (Narodniks) hesitantly, uphold the “need” for a new revolution, and are carrying on propaganda in fa-vour of such a revolution. 
 The upswing of the mass struggle has begun . 
 The revolutionary Social-Democrats are trying to extend and strengthen it, helping it develop to a stillhigher plane, to the stage of revolution . 
 The reformists, however, regard the upswing as a mere “revival”; theirpolicy is a policy aimed at obtaining constitutional con-cessions, constitutional reforms. 
 It follows that the bour-geoisie and proletariat have entered, at this “stage” of Rus-sian history as well, into a struggle for influence over the“people”, over the masses. 
 No one can foretell the outcomeof this struggle, but neither can anyone entertain any doubtsas to the position which the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 must occupy inthis struggle. 
 It is in this way, and only in this way, that one can start to appraise the election platform of the Party and the election platform issued the other day by the “OrganisingCommittee” elected by the liquidationist conference. 
 The election platform of the Party, published by the Central Committee after the January Conference, was draft-ed before the events of April and May. 
 These events proved it correct. 
 A single theme runs through the whole platform—criticism of constitutional reforms in present-day Russia as hopeless and utopian, and the propaganda of revolution. 
The slogans of the platform have been framed precisely in such a way as to express the revolutionary tasks with perfect clarity and make it absolutely impossible to mistake them for promises of constitutional reforms. 
 The platformof the Party represents a direct appeal of the revolution-ary Social-Democrats to hundreds of thousands of political strikers, to those who are in the front ranks of the millionsof the muzhik armed forces, to whom it explains the tasks of an uprising. 
 A revolutionary party could not even dream of a better test for its platform, of a better confirmationof it by experience, than this direct response to the expla-nations of the Party—the May strikes and the attemptedmilitary revolts in June and July. 
 Look at the platform of the liquidators. 
 Its liquidation-ist essence is artfully concealed by Trotsky’s revolutionary phrases. 
 This camouflage may sometimes blind naïve andaltogether inexperienced people, and may even appear to be “reconciliation” between the liquidators and the Party. 
 But the most cursory examination will rapidly dissipate this self-deception. 
 The platform of the liquidators was written after the May strikes and the attempted revolts in the summer. 
 And inseeking a real practical answer to the question of the essenceof this platform, the first thing we ask is: how does it ap-praise those strikes and those attempts? “The economic upswing...”, “...by the growth of its strike movement, the proletariat has signalled the comingnew social upswing...”, “...the powerful April movement ofthe proletariat demanding freedom of association”—thatis all the liquidators’ platform says about the April and May strikes. 
 But this is indeed an untruth! It is a crying distortion of the issue! The main thing is omitted here, namely, the revo-lutionary character of the political strike, which is not aimed at winning a constitutional reform, but at over-throwing the government, i. 
e. 
, at revolution. 
 How could such an untruth come to be written in an illegal, revolutionary leaflet full of “red” phrases? It had to be, because such is the view of the liberals and the liqui-dators. 
 They see in strikes what they wish to see—a strug-gle for constitutional reforms. 
 They do not see what theydo not wish to see, namely, a revolutionary upswing. 
 Weliberals want to fight for reform, but not for revolution— there you have the truth of the class position that found expression in the untruth of the liquidators. 
 With regard to the attempted revolts we read, “...the soldiers in the barracks are driven by violence, humilia-tion and starvation to outbursts of desperate protest , then they are suppressed with bullets, the rope”, etc. 
 This is a liberal appraisal. 
 We revolutionary Social-Democrats regard the attempted revolts as the beginning of an uprising of the masses , even if an unsuccessful, untimely, incorrect beginning. 
 And we know that the masses learn how to make a successful uprising only from the experienceof unsuccessful ones, just as the Russian workers, by a series of unsuccessful, and sometimes particularly unsuccess-ful, political strikes in 1901-04 learned to organise thesuccessful strike of October 1905. 
 We say that the workers and peasants who are most downtrodden by the barracks have begun to rise in revolt. 
 Hence the plain and obvious con-clusion: we must explain to them how and for what purpose they should prepare for a successful uprising. 
 The liberals take a different view. 
 The soldiers are “driv-en” to “outbursts of desperate protest”, they say. 
 To a lib-eral, an insurgent soldier is not the subject of the revolution,not the forerunner of the masses rising in revolt, but an object of governmental evil (“driven to desperation”), serv-ing to demonstrate that evil. 
 See how bad our government is—it drives the soldiers to desperation and then suppresses them with bullets, says the liberal (the inference being: if we liberals were in power,there would be no soldiers’ mutinies). 
 See how deeply and widely revolutionary energy is matur-ing among the masses—says the Social-Democrat—even thesoldiers and sailors who are downtrodden by barrack drillare beginning to rise in revolt, and by rising badly theyteach how to rise successfully. 
 As you see, the liquidators have “ interpreted ” (in the senatorial sense of the word interpret) the revolutionary upsurge in Russia during the spring and the summer. 
 After which they “interpreted” the programme of our Party. 
 The Programme of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 says: “The R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 sets itself the immediate political task of overthrowing the tsarist autocracy and replacing it by a democraticrepublic, whose constitution would ensure : (1) the sovereignty of the people” ... etc. 
, and then comes a list of “liberties” and “rights”. 
 One would think that this could not be misunderstood; the “immediate” task is the overthrow of the autocracy and its replacement by a republic, which would ensure liberties. 
 The liquidators have revised all this. 
 In their platform we read: “The Social-Democrats call on the people to fight for a democratic republic.... 
 “Striving for this aim, which the people will be able to achieve only as a result of revolution , the Social-Democrats in the present election campaign [listen to this!] call on the working masses to rally to the following current demands: (1) universal, etc. 
, suffrage ... in the elections to the Duma ”, etc. 
 Mr. 
 Peshekhonov, a Socialist-Revolutionary liquidator, wrote in the autumn of 1906, when he was founding an “open party” (and almost succeeded in founding it, but the police stepped in and put him in quod!), that the republic was a“remote prospect”, that “the question of a republic requires extreme caution”, that the immediate demands now were reforms. 
 But the Socialist-Revolutionary liquidator was naïve, simple, clumsy and blunt. 
 Do the “European” opportunists ever act in that way? No. 
 They are more cunning, moreclever, more diplomatic. 
 They do not renounce the slogan of a republic—what a libel! They only “interpret” it in a suitable fashion, beingprompted by considerations obvious to every philistine. 
 It is a moot point whether there will be a revolution or not, says the man in the street simply, and Trotsky repeats itin a scholarly fashion in Nasha Zarya (No. 
 5, p. 
 21). 
 A republic “ only as a result of revolution”, but the “ current ” issue “in the present election campaign” is constitutionalreforms! Everything went off so smoothly: the republic is both recognised and relegated to the distant future. 
 Heaps ofr-r-revolutionary words were spoken, but in reality thedemands put forward “in the present election campaign” (thewhole platform is written only for this present campaign !) as “current” are those for reforms. 
 Yes, it was certainly great “masters of diplomacy” who were present at the liquidators’ conference. 
 But what punymasters they are! While they may delight the group di-plomatists and mislead the simple-minded “conciliators”,the Marxists will talk to them in a different strain. 
 The philistine is satisfied with the undoubted, holy and empty truth that it is impossible to say in advance whether there will be a revolution or not. 
 A Marxist is not satisfiedwith that; he says: our propaganda and the propaganda ofall worker Social-Democrats is one of the factors determining whether there will be a revolution or not. 
 Hundreds of thou-sands of political strikers and the foremost men of various units of the armed forces ask us, our Party, what they should strive for, for the sake of what they should rise, what theyshould try to achieve, whether they should expand the up-surge that has begun into a revolution, or whether they should direct it towards a struggle for reforms. 
 The revolutionary Social-Democrats have given their answer to these questions, which are more interesting andimportant than the philistine-Trotskyist attitude of un-certainty: will there be a revolution or not, who can tell? Our answer is—criticism of the utopia of constitutional reforms, explanation of the futility of the hopes placed in them, the utmost all-round promotion of the revolutionary upsurge, utilisation of the election campaign for this pur-pose . 
 Whether or not there will be a revolution does not depend on us alone . 
 But we shall do our work, and this work will never be in vain. 
 It will sow the seeds of democracy andproletarian independence deep among the masses, and these seeds will certainly sprout and produce either a democratic revolution tomorrow, or a socialist revolution the day after. 
 Those , however, who preach to the masses their vulgar, intellectualist, Bundist-Trotskyist scepticism—“we don’tknow whether there will be a revolution or not, but the‘current ’ issue is reforms”—are already corrupting the masses, preaching liberal utopias to them. 
 Instead of permeating the election campaign with the spirit of the present, real, “ actual ” political situation, in which half a million workers are engaged in revolutionary strikes,and the foremost men in the muzhik armed forces are firingon their aristocrat officers—instead of this they dismiss from their would-be “European” (they are so European, so European, are our liquidators!) “parliamentary” con-siderations this real situation (in which there is very littleof the “European”, but very much of the “Chinese”, that is to say , of the democratic-revolutionary), and having dismissed it by means of a few non-committal phrases, they declare the reformist election campaign to be the real thing. 
 The Social-Democratic Party needs a platform for the elections to the Fourth Duma in order once more to explainto the masses—in connection with the elections, on theoccasion of the elections, and in debates on the elections— the need for , and the urgency and inevitability of , the revo-lution. 
 They, the liquidators, need a platform “ for” the elections, i. 
e. 
, a platform enabling them politely to dismiss consider-ations about a revolution as an uncertain eventuality and to declare the election campaign for a list of constitutional reforms to be the “real” thing. 
 The Social-Democratic Party wants to use the elections in order again to drive home to the masses the idea of theneed for revolution, and the fact of the revolutionary up-swing which has begun. 
 That is why the Social-DemocraticParty, in its platform, says briefly and plainly to those vot-ing in the elections to the Fourth Duma : not constitutional reforms, but a republic, not reformism, but revolution. 
 The liquidators are using the elections to the Fourth Duma to preach constitutional reforms and weaken the idea of revolution. 
 It is for this purpose and because of this that they depict soldiers’ revolts as “outbursts of desperate protest” to which soldiers are “driven”, and not as the beginning of a mass uprising which will grow or subside ac-cording, among other things, to whether or not all the So-cial-Democratic workers of Russia at once begin to supportit with all their might, with all their energy, with all theirenthusiasm. 
 It is for this purpose that the May strikes have been “in-terpreted” from being revolutionary into being reformist. 
 It is for this purpose that the Party programme has been “interpreted”, and instead of the “immediate” task of estab-lishing a republic that will ensure liberties, it has been de-creed to regard as current in the “present election cam-paign”—for the Fourth Duma, don’t laugh!—the demand for various liberties. 
 How much that is old Chinese there is in Russian life! What an amount of old Chinese practices there is in ourtsarism, and also in our liquidators, who wish to fit the“ceremonials” of parliamentary struggle and reformism into a setting which has the Purishkeviches and Treshchenkovs on top and revolutionary attempts of the masses below!How much that is old Chinese there is in these vain effortsof intellectuals to defend themselves against the Khvostovsand Makarovs by producing a letter of recommendation fromMacDonald and Jaurès, from Bissolati and Bernstein, from Kolb and Frank! The diplomatic “reconciliation” of liquidationist views with those of the Party that was staged by Trotsky at the liquidationist conference does not in reality “reconcile” anything at all. 
 It does not remove the greatest political fact, which determines the entire social and political situa-tion in present-day Russia. 
 That fact is the struggle be-tween the reformist and the revolutionary Social-Democraticplatforms; it is the pronouncement of the bourgeoisie, asrepresented by its liberal party leaders, against the needfor a new revolution in Russia and in favour of purely con-stitutional “work”, in opposition to the revolutionary strike of hundreds of thousands of proletarians, which is a call tothe masses to begin a real struggle for freedom. 
 To make one bow to the reformists and another to the revolutionary Social-Democrats does not do away with thisobjective political fact, does not weaken its force and weight in the slightest degree. 
 Good intentions to smooth over differences arising from this fact—even assuming that theseintentions are indeed perfectly “good” and sincere—arepowerless to alter the irreconcilably hostile political tenden-cies arising from the entire counter-revolutionary situation. 
 The proletariat has risen with its revolutionary Social-Democratic banner, and on the eve of the Fourth, Black-Hundred, Duma, it will not lower it before the liberals,will not furl it to please the reformists, will not consent toblunt or tone down its platform for reasons of groupdiplomacy. 
 The platform of revolutionary Social-Democracy versus the platform of reformism—this was the watchword under which the May strikes took place. 
 Under it, too, theR.

 Sotsial-Demokrat No. 
 28-29 , Published according to November 5 (18), 1912 the text in Sotsial-Demokrat THE ILLEGAL PARTY AND LEGAL WORK The question of the illegal party and of legal work of the Social-Democrats in Russia is one of the cardinal Party questions. 
 It has been the concern of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 throughout the post-revolutionary period, and has given rise to the bitterest struggle within its ranks. 
 The struggle over this issue has been going on chiefly between the liquidators and the anti-liquidators, and itsbitterness is due in full measure to the fact that it amounted to the question whether our old, illegal Party was to be or not to be. 
 The Conference of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 in December1908 emphatically condemned liquidationism and, in a spe-cial resolution, clearly formulated the Party’s view on theorganisational question: the Party is made up of illegalSocial-Democratic nuclei, which must establish for them-selves “strong-points for work among the masses” in the form of as wide and as ramified a network of various legalworkers’ societies as possible. 
 Both the decision of the Plenary Meeting of the Central Committee in January 1910 and the All-Russia Conferencein January 1912 fully confirmed this view of the Party. 
 The thoroughly definite and stable character of this view is perhaps most clearly described in Comrade Plekhanov’slatest Dnevnik (No. 
 16, April 1912). 
 We say “most clearly” because it was Plekhanov who at that time took a neutralstand (on the significance of the January Conference). 
 Andfrom his neutral standpoint, he fully confirmed this estab-lished Party view, saying that the so-called “initiating groups”—which had broken away from the Party organisa-tion or had deserted it or arisen independently of it—could not be considered as belonging to the Party without a spe-cial decision taken by a congress or conference of the illegal nuclei. 
 It is anarchism in regard to principle, and sup-port for and legitimation of liquidationism in regard topractice, wrote Comrade Plekhanov, to allow the “initiat-ing groups” to decide for themselves whether they belong to the Party. 
 It would seem that, in view of this last explanation by the neutral Plekhanov, the question which has been quite definitely decided by the Party on so many occasions shouldbe regarded as finished with. 
 But the resolution of the lat-est liquidationist conference makes us return to it in viewof the fresh attempts to tangle what had been untangledand to obscure things that are clear. 
 Nevsky Golos (No. 
 9), along with the most furious abuse of the anti-liquidators, declared that the new conference was not liquidationist. 
Yet the conference resolution on one of the most importantissues, that of the illegal Party and legal work, shows mostplainly that the conference was liquidationist through andthrough. 
 It is necessary, therefore, to analyse the resolution in detail and to quote it in full for this purpose. 
 I The resolution of the liquidators’ conference is headed “Organisational Forms of Party Building ”, yet its very first clause reveals that it is not a question of “forms” of build-ing, but of the kind of party—old or new—that they want to “build” in this case. 
 Here is that first clause: “This Conference, having discussed the forms and methods of building the Party, has reached the following conclusion: “1. 
 The transformation of the Social-Democratic Party into a self-governing organisation of the, Social-Democratic proletariat can be effected only insofar as the Social-Democratic organisation takesshape in the course of drawing the mass of the workers into opensocial and political activities in all their manifestations. 
” Thus the very first word used in the resolution on build-ing the Party is an unqualified recognition of the neces-sity for a transformation of the Social-Democratic Party. 
 This is strange, to say the least. 
 To be sure, every member of the Party has a right to seek its “transformation”, but then the question has admittedly been, for four years already, whether the old Party should be recognised! Anyone knows that! The Party resolution (December 1908) spoke in the clear-est possible terms of condemning the liquidators, who wanted to “ replace ” the old Party by a new one. 
 In April 1912 Plekhanov asked point-blank the defenders of the“initiating groups” which planned to (and did) call a liq-uidationist conference: “Does our old Party exist or not?”(Dnevnik Sotsial-Demokrata No. 
 16, April 1912, p. 
 8). 
 This question cannot be evaded. 
 It is posed by a four years’ struggle. 
 It fully expresses the gravity of the so-called Party “crisis”. 
 When a question such as this is answered by saying: “the transformation of the Social-Democratic Party ... can be effected only—”, we see at once that it is a meaning-less evasion and not an answer. 
 None but members of the old Party may speak of trans-forming the Party. 
 By evading the question whether there is an old Party or not, and decreeing without further ado(with non-Party “initiating groups” co-operating) what you call a “transformation”, you do no more, gentlemen, thanfully confirm that your standpoint is liquidationist! This becomes still more evident when the resolution, after the perfectly meaningless, declamatory phrase about a “self-governing organisation of the Social-Democratic proletar-iat”, reduces the issue to the proposition that the “trans-formation” “ can be effected only insofar as the Social-Democratic organisation takes shape [we will not dwell on the ridiculous, inflated and stupid phraseology used] in the course of drawing the mass of the workers into open social and political activities”!! What does that mean? Do the authors of this amazing resolution call strikes and demonstrations “drawing themasses into open”, etc. 
, activities? Logic suggests that they do! In that case the resolution is sheer nonsense, for anyone knows very well that an “organisation takes shape ” even without strikes and demonstrations. 
 The organisation, /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR wise gentlemen, is always there, while the masses resort to open action only from time to time. 
 By “open social and political activities” (the bureaucrat-ic-liberal style those people use—just like that of Russkiye Vedomosti thirty years ago!) the liquidators mean the legal forms of the working-class movement, and not at all strikes, demonstrations and so on. 
 Splendid. 
 In that case,too, the resolution is nonsense, because it is by no means “only” in the course of drawing the masses into the legal movement that in our country the organisation“takes shape”, and has taken shape. 
 We have organisations in many places where no forms of legal movement are allowed. 
 Thus the main clause of the resolution (the organisation takes shape “ only insofar ”) is definitely worthless. 
 It is nothing but a muddle. 
 But there is an obvious liquidationist content to this mud-dle. 
 A transformation is possible only in the course of draw-ing the masses into the legal movement—that is what the gibberish of Clause 1 boils down to. 
 And this is the sheerest liquidationism. 
 For four years the Party has been saying: our organisa-tion consists of illegal nuclei surrounded by as wide andas ramified a network of legal societies as possible. 
 For four years the liquidators have been denying that they are liquidators, and for four years they have been asserting: a transformation can be effected only in the course of drawing the masses into the legal movement. 
 They evadethe question of what our Party consists of and what this old Party is like , doing it in exactly the way that suits the legalists. 
 It is very much the same old story; in April 1912Plekhanov asked: does our old Party exist or not? The liquidators’ conference replies: “a transformation can be effected only insofar as the masses are drawn into the legal movement”! This reply comes from the legalists, who have broken away from the Party and who yesterday were strong andgoaded the Party, but today (having been defeated) are timid and defend themselves by eloquence. 
 II Clause 2 of the resolution reads: “2. 
 In view of the changed social and political conditions com-pared with the pre-revolutionary epoch, the illegal Party organisa-tions already existing or coming into existence must adapt themselvesto the new forms and methods of the open working-class movement. 
” Fine logic again. 
 A change in social conditions necessi-tates only a change in the form of organisation, but the resolution in no way substantiates the direction of this change. 
 Why does the resolution refer to “the changed social and political conditions”? Evidently to prove, substantiate and draw the practical conclusion: it is necessary for the illegalorganisation to adapt itself to the legal movement. 
 But thepremise does not warrant this conclusion. 
 “In view of thechanged conditions”, the legal must adapt itself to the ille-gal—such a conclusion would be just as legitimate! Why this confusion of the liquidators? Because they are afraid to tell the truth and want to sit on two stools at once. 
 The truth is that the liquidators stand for a liquidation-ist appraisal (made by Levitsky, Larin, Yezhov and others) of the “present situation”, for explaining how “social and political conditions have changed” is an appraisal of the present situation. 
 But they are afraid to state that appraisal in plain terms. 
 Indeed, the conference could not bring itself even to raisethis question. 
 Tacitly, stealthily, in a smuggling fashion,it upholds the view that there have come about ( some kind of) changes which necessitate “adapting” the illegal to the legal. 
 This is a view which in no way differs from the Cadet view, as the Social-Democratic Party press has repeatedlypointed out. 
 The Cadets fully admit that their party “asa whole is compelled to remain illegal” (see Clause 3 of the liquidators’ resolution) and that, in view of changed con-ditions, the illegal party must adapt itself to the legalmovement. 
 As far as the Cadets are concerned, this is enough. 
 To them prohibition of their party, its illegality, is an accident, an “abnormality”, a survival whereas the main, essential and basic thing is their legal work. 
 This view of theirs follows logically from the “appraisal of the situation” formulated by Mr. 
 Gredeskul: what is needed is not a newrevolution, but only “constitutional work”. 
 The illegality of the Cadet Party is an accident; it is an exception from the general rule of “constitutional work”. 
 Hence the logical conclusion that the illegal organisation must “adapt itself to the legal movement”. 
 And that is howmatters actually stand with the Cadets. 
 But the Social-Democratic Party takes a different view. 
 The main conclusion to be drawn from our appraisal—theParty appraisal—of the situation is that the revolution is necessary and is coming . 
 The forms of the development leading to the revolution have changed, but the old tasks o f the revolution remain. 
 Hence the conclusion: the forms oforganisation must change, the forms of the “nuclei” mustbe flexible, their expansion will often occur through theexpansion, not of the nuclei themselves, but of their legal “periphery”, etc. 
 All this has been stated many times in Party resolutions. 
 But this change in the forms of the illegal organisation is not at all covered by the formula: “adaptation” to the legalmovement. 
 It is something entirely different! Legal organi-sations are strong-points for propagating the ideas of illegal nuclei among the masses. 
 In other words, we change the form of exerting influence to ensure that former influence con-tinues along illegal lines. 
 In terms of the form of the organisations, the illegal “adapts itself” to the legal. 
 But in terms of the content of the work of our Party, legal activity “ adapts itself ” to illegal ideas. 
 (Hence—it may be said in passing—the war which “revolutionary Menshevism” has been waging againstthe liquidators. 
) Now judge how profound our liquidators must be to have accepted the first premise (on the form of the work) and forgotten the second (on the content of the work)!! And they have headed their piece of Cadet wisdom by an argu-ment about the organisational forms of Party building that runs as follows: “We must build the Party in such a way as to reorganise [it] by drawing the masses into the legal movement and to adapt theillegal organisation to that movement. 
” The question arises: does this look like the answer of the Party? (To build the Party means strengthening and increas-ing the number of illegal nuclei, surrounding them by anetwork of legal strong-points. 
) Or does it look like legalising a loophole for the liquida-tors, since it repeats the ideas of the Cadets and the Popular Socialists? It was precisely these ideas that Mr. 
 Peshekho-nov, a Popular Socialist, was defending in August 1906,when he tried to found an “open party”—see Russkoye Bo-gatstvo , 1906, No. 
 8, and Proletary No. 
 4, the article “So-cialist-Revolutionary Mensheviks”. 
 * III Clause 3 of the resolution reads: “3. 
 The Social-Democratic Party even at the present time, when its organisation as a whole is forced to remain illegal, must endeav-our to carry on various parts of its Party work openly and to estab-lish appropriate bodies for this purpose. 
” We have already pointed out that this is a literally exact description of the Cadet Party, correct from the first to the last word. 
 But the term “Social-Democratic” is out of placehere. 
 It is true that the Cadet Party “as a whole” is “forced” to remain illegal, and that “even” at the present time (whenwe have a constitution, thank God) they endeavour tocarry on parts of their party work openly. 
 The implicit premise which shows through every line of this liquidationist resolution is its recognition of “consti-tutional work” as the sole work or, at the least, as the chief, fundamental and lasting work. 
 That is radically wrong. 
 It is precisely a liberal labour policy outlook. 
 The Social-Democratic Party is illegal both “as a whole” and in its every nucleus, and— most important of all —in the entire content of its work, which is to propagate and *See present edition, Vol. 
 11, pp.

— Ed. 
 pave the way for the revolution. 
 Therefore the most open work of the most open nucleus of the Social-Democratic Party can not be regarded as “openly conducted Party work”. 
 For example, the most “open” nucleus of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 in 1907-12 was the Social-Democratic Duma group. 
 It wasin a position to speak more “openly” than anyone else. 
 Italone was legal, and could speak legally of a great many things . 
 But not of everything ! And not only, generally speaking, “not of everything”, but not, in particular, even of its ownParty and its Party work—“not of everything” nor of themost important thing. 
 That is why, even in respect of the Social-Democratic Duma group, we cannot accept Clause 3of the liquidationist resolution, not to speak of the remain-ing “various parts” of the Party. 
 The liquidators advocate an “open”, legal party. 
 They are now afraid (the workers have made them afraid, andTrotsky advises them to be afraid) to say so plainly. 
 Theynow say the same thing using little disguises . 
 They say nothing about legalising the Party. 
 But they advocate its legalisation by parts ! The “initiating groups” of the legalists who have broken away are anti-Party, the neutral Plekhanov told the liquida-tors in April 1912. 
 The “initiating groups” of the break-away legalists are precisely the open conduct of variousparts of “Party work”, the liquidationist conference replies; they are precisely the “open movement” to which the illegal Party must “adapt” itself; they are the “open activities”,the “drawing” of the masses into which is the yardstick andguarantee of the necessary “transformation” of the Party. 
 What simpletons the liquidators must have found if their story is true that these views were approved by the “anti-liquidators” brought by Trotsky! IV The last clause of the resolution reads: “4. 
 Being unable, on account of the illegal conditions of its exist-ence, to draw into its sphere large sections of the workers to whomits influence extends, the Social-Democratic organisation must link itself with the politically active sections of the proletariat and through them with the masses, by establishing various kinds of more or less developed legal or illegal political organisations and various kindsof legal cover (election committees, political societies founded underthe law of March 4, municipal companies, societies for combatingthe high cost of living, and so on), as well as by co-ordinating itsactions with non-political working-class organisations. 
” Here, too, indisputable arguments about legal covers disguise what is not merely disputable but downright liq-uidationist. 
 Establishing legal political organisations is precisely what Levitsky and N. 
 R—kov advocated; it is legalisationof the Party part by part. 
 For more than a year we have been telling the liquida-tors: stop talking and start founding your “legal political societies”, such as the “society for the defence of working-class interests”, and so on. 
 Stop phrase-mongering and getdown to work! But they cannot get down to work because it is impos-sible to realise a liberal utopia in present-day Russia. 
 All they can do is to defend in this covert fashion their “initiat-ing groups”, which are engaged in useful talk and mutualencouragement, in suggestions and considerations about“legal political organisations”. 
 They defend their “initiating groups”, officially declaring in their resolution that the illegal organisations must “link themselves with the politically-active sections of the prole-tariat and through them with the masses”!!! That is to say, it is outside the nuclei that the “politically-active” are to be found! Is this not a mere rewording of the well-knownphrases and exclamations to the effect that all the activehave fled from the “dead Party” into the “initiating groups”? Trotsky and the liquidators expelled from the Party are putting more “mildly” what Nasha Zarya and Dyelo Zhizni 147 said plainly in reviling the illegal Party: in their view, it is outside the narrow illegal Party that the most “ active ” are, and it is with these that one must “link oneself”. 
 We—the liquidators who have broken away—are the active ele-ment; through us the “Party” must link itself with the masses. 
 The Party has said in no uncertain terms: in leading the economic struggle, the Social-Democratic Party nuclei must co-operate with the trade unions, with the Social-Democratic nuclei in them, and with individual leaders of the trade union movement. 
 Or, in the Duma election cam-paign, it is essential that the unions should march abreastof the Party. 
 This is clear, precise and easy to understand. 
What the liquidators are advocating instead is a hazy “co-ordination” of the Party’s work in general with the “non-political”, i. 
e. 
, non-Party, unions. 
 P. 
 B. 
 Axelrod supplied Trotsky with liquidationist ideas. 
 Trotsky advised Axelrod, after the latter’s sad reverses inNasha Zarya , to cover up those ideas with phrases that would muddle them up. 
 Nobody will be deceived by this company. 
 The liquida-tionist conference will teach the workers to look more close-ly into the meaning of evasive phraseology. 
 That confer-ence has nothing to give the workers apart from this lesson,which is bitter and uninteresting but not useless in bourgeoissociety. 
 We have studied the ideas of liberal labour policy attired in Levitsky’s everyday clothes; it is not difficult to recognise them in Trotsky’s gaudy apparel as well. 
 The Party’s views on the illegal organisation and its legal work stand out more and more impressively when com-pared with all that hypocritical masquerading. 
 Sotsial-Demokrat No. 
 28-29 , Published according to November 5 (18), 1912 to the text in Sotsial-Demokrat THE SOCIAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SERBO-BULGARIAN VICTORIES “Macedonia’s conquest by Bulgaria and Serbia means for her a bourgeois revolution, a kind of 1789 or 1848. 
” These words of Otto Bauer, the Austrian Marxist, revealat a stroke the meaning of the events now taking place in theBalkans. 
 The revolution of 1789 in France and that of 1848 in Germany and other countries were bourgeois revolutions, because the liberation of the country from absolutism and from landlord, feudal privileges in fact provided freedomfor the development of capitalism. 
 But it goes withoutsaying that such revolutions were most urgently required bythe interests of the working class; in 1789 and 1848 even“non-Party” workers, who were not organised as a class, were leading fighters of the French and German revolutions. 
 Macedonia, like the other Balkan countries, is economi-cally very backward. 
 She still retains exceedingly strongsurvivals of the feudal system and of medieval dependenceof the peasants on their feudal landlords. 
 Among thosesurvivals are quit-rent (in money or kind), share-cropping (the Macedonian peasant usually gives the landlord one-third of the harvest, that is, less than the Russian peasantdoes), and so on. 
 The landlords in Macedonia (known as spahijas ) are Turks and Mohammedans, while the peasants are Slavs andChristians. 
 The class antagonism is therefore aggravated by a religious and national antagonism. 
 Thus, the victories gained by the Serbians and Bulgari-ans denote the undermining of feudal rule in Macedonia, the formation of a more or less free class of peasant land-owners, and a guarantee for the entire social development of the Balkan countries, which has been checked by absolu-tism and feudal relations. 
 Bourgeois newspapers, from Novoye Vremya to Rech , are talking of national liberation in the Balkans, leaving out economic liberation. 
 Yet in reality it is the latter that is the chief thing. 
 Given complete liberation from the landlords and from absolutism, national liberation and complete freedom ofself-determination of the peoples would be an inevitableresult. 
 On the other hand, if the tyranny of the landlordsand the Balkan monarchies over the peoples remains, na-tional oppression, too, is bound to persist in some measure or another. 
 If the liberation of Macedonia had been accomplished through a revolution, that is, through the Serbian and Bul-garian and also the Turkish peasants fighting against the landlords of all nationalities (and against the landlord governments in the Balkans), liberation would probably have cost the Balkan peoples a hundred times less in human lives than the present war. 
 Liberation would have beenachieved at an infinitely lower price and would have beeninfinitely more complete. 
 One may ask what are the historical causes of the issue being settled by war and not by revolution. 
 The main his-torical cause is the weakness, disunity, immaturity and ignorance of the peasant masses in all the Balkan coun-tries, as well as the small number of the workers who had aclear understanding of the state of affairs and demanded aBalkan federal (union) republic. 
 This brings out the radical difference between the Euro-pean bourgeoisie and the European workers in their attitude to the Balkan problem. 
 The bourgeoisie, even the liberalbourgeoisie, similar to our Cadets, shouts about the “na-tional” liberation of the “Slavs”. 
 Thereby it plainly misrep-resents the meaning and historic significance of the eventsnow taking place in the Balkans, and thus hampers the real liberation of the Balkan peoples. 
 It thus contributes t o the preservation of landlord privileges, political tyrannyand national oppression in some measure or another. 
 On the other hand, the worker democrats are the only ones to champion the real and complete liberation of the Balkan peoples. 
 Nothing but economic and political liber-ation of the peasants of all the Balkan nationalities, car-ried through to the end, can eliminate all possibility of anysort of national oppression.

 to the Pravda text REGENERATED CHINA Progressive and civilised Europe shows no interest in the regeneration of China. 
 Four hundred million backwardAsians have attained freedom, and have awakened to po-litical life. 
 One quarter of the world’s population has passed, so to say, from torpor to enlightenment, movementand struggle. 
 But civilised Europe does not care. 
 To this day even the French Republic has not officially recognised the Republicof China! A question on this subject is to be asked shortly in the French Chamber of Deputies. 
 Why this indifference on the part of Europe? The ex-planation is that throughout the West power is in the handsof the imperialist bourgeoisie, which is already three-quart-ers decayed and willing to sell all its “civilisation” to anyadventurer for “stringent” measures against the workers, or for an extra five kopeks’ profit on the ruble. 
 To this bourgeoi-sie, China is only booty, and now that Russia has taken Mongolia into her “tender embrace”, the Japanese, BritishGermans, etc. 
, will probably try to tear off a piece of thisbooty. 
 But China’s regeneration is making speed nevertheless Parliamentary elections are about to be held—the first i n what was a despotic state. 
 The Lower House will have 600members and the “Senate”, 274. 
 Suffrage is neither universal nor direct. 
 It is granted only to persons above the age of 21 who have resided in the con-stituency for at least two years and who pay direct taxes amounting to about two rubles, or own property worth about 500 rubles. 
 They will first vote for electors, whowill elect the members of parliament. 
 This kind of suffrage indicates in itself that there is an alliance of the well-to-do peasantry and the bourgeoisie, there being no proletariat at all or one that is completely powerless. 
 The same circumstance is evident from the nature of China’s political parties. 
 There are three main parties: (1) The Radical-Socialist Party, which in fact has noth-ing at all to do with socialism, any more than our own Popular Socialists (and nine-tenths of the Socialist-Revo-lutionaries). 
 It is a party of petty-bourgeois democrats , and its chief demands are political unity of China, develop-ment of trade and industry “along social lines” (just ashazy a phrase as the “labour principle” and “equalisation”of our Narodniks and Socialist-Revolutionaries), and pres-ervation of peace. 
 (2) The second party is that of the liberals. 
 They are in alliance with the Radical-Socialists and together withthem constitute the National Party . 
 This party will in all likelihood win a majority in China’s first parliament. 
 Itsleader is the well-known Dr. 
 Sun Yat-sen. 
 He is now draw-ing up a plan for a vast railway network (Russian Narod-niks will please note that Sun Yat-sen is doing this in order that China may “avoid” a capitalist fate!). 
 (3) The third party calls itself the Republican League, an example of how deceptive political signboards can be. 
Actually it is a conservative party, backed chiefly by govern-ment officials, landlords and the bourgeoisie of northern China, which is the most backward part of the country. 
The National Party, on the other hand, is predominantly aparty of the more industrially-developed and progressivesouthern part of the country. 
 The peasant masses are the mainstay of the National Party. 
 Its leaders are intellectuals who have been educated abroad. 
 China’s freedom was won by an alliance of peasant demo-crats and the liberal bourgeoisie. 
 Whether the peasants,who are not led by a proletarian party, will be able to re-tain their democratic positions against the liberals, who are only waiting for an opportunity to shift to the right, will be seen in the near future.

 to the Pravda text THE RESULTS AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE U. 
S. 
 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS Wilson, a “Democrat”, has been elected President of the United States of America. 
 He has polled over six mil-lion votes, Roosevelt (the new National Progressive Party) over four million, Taft (Republican Party) over three mil-lion, and the Socialist Eugene Debs 800,000 votes. 
 The world significance of the U. 
S. 
 elections lies not so much in the great increase in the number of Socialist votesas in the far-reaching crisis of the bourgeois parties, in the amazing force with which their decay has been revealed. 
 Lastly, the significance of the elections lies in the un-usually clear and striking revelation of bourgeois reformism as a means of combating socialism. 
 In all bourgeois countries, the parties which stand for capitalism, i. 
e. 
, the bourgeois parties, came into being a long time ago, and the greater the extent of political lib-erty, the more solid they are. 
 Freedom in the U. 
S. 
A. 
 is most complete. 
 And for a whole half-century —since the Civil War over slavery in 1860-65— two bourgeois parties have been distinguished there by remarkable solidity and strength. 
 The party of the former slave-owners is the so-called Democratic Party. 
 The capital-ist party, which favoured the emancipation of the Negroes,has developed into the Republican Party. 
 Since the emancipation of the Negroes, the distinction between the two parties has been diminishing. 
 The fightbetween these two parties has been mainly over the height of customs duties. 
 Their fight has not had any serious impor-tance for the mass of the people. 
 The people have beendeceived and diverted from their vital interests by means of spectacular and meaningless duels between the two bour-geois parties. 
 This so-called bipartisan system prevailing in America and Britain has been one of the most powerful means of pre-venting the rise of an independent working-class, i. 
e. 
, gen-uinely socialist, party. 
 And now the bipartisan system has suffered a fiasco in America, the country boasting the most advanced capital-ism! What caused this fiasco? The strength of the working-class movement, the growth of socialism. 
 The old bourgeois parties (the “Democratic” and the “Republican” parties) have been facing towards the past, theperiod of the emancipation of the Negroes. 
 The new bour-geois party, the National Progressive Party, is facing to-wards the future . 
 Its programme turns entirely on the ques-tion whether capitalism is to be or not to be, on the issues,to be specific, of protection for the workers and of “trusts”,as the capitalist associations are called in the U. 
S. 
A. 
 The old parties are products of an epoch whose task was to develop capitalism as speedily as possible. 
 The struggle between the parties was over the question how best to expe-dite and facilitate this development. 
 The new party is a product of the present epoch, which raises the issue of the very existence of capitalism. 
 In theU. 
S. 
A. 
, the freest and most advanced country, this issue is coming to the fore more clearly and broadly than any-where else. 
 The entire programme and entire agitation of Roosevelt and the Progressives turn on how to save capitalism b y means of bourgeois reforms . 
 The bourgeois reformism which in old Europe manifests itself in the chatter of liberal professors has all at once come forward in the free American republic as a party fourmillion strong. 
 This is American style. 
 We shall save capitalism by reforms, says that party. 
 We shall grant the most progressive factory legislation. 
We shall establish state control over all the trusts (in the U. 
S. 
A. 
 that means over all industries!). 
 We shall establish state control over them to eliminate poverty and enableeverybody to earn a “decent” wage. 
 We shall establish “social and industrial justice”. 
 We revere all reforms— the only “reform ” we don’t want is expropriation of the capital-ists! The national wealth of the U. 
S. 
A. 
 is now reckoned to be 120 billion (thousand million) dollars, i. 
e. 
, about 240 bil-lion rubles. 
 Approximately one-third of it, or about 80 bil-lion rubles, belongs to two trusts, those of Rockefeller and Morgan, or is subordinated to these trusts! Not more than 40,000 families making up these two trusts are the masters of 80 million wage slaves. 
 Obviously, so long as these modern slave-owners are there, all “reforms” will be nothing but a deception. 
 Roose-velt has been deliberately hired by the astute multimillion-aires to preach this deception. 
 The “state control” they pro-mise will become—if the capitalists keep their capital—a means of combating and crushing strikes. 
 But the American proletarian has already awakened and has taken up his post. 
 He greets Roosevelt’s success withcheerful irony, as if to say: You lured four million peoplewith your promises of reform, dear impostor Roosevelt. 
 Very well! Tomorrow those four million will see that your promises were a fraud, and don’t forget that they are fol-lowing you only because they feel that it is impossible t o go on living in the old way.

 to the Pravda text THE “VEXED QUESTIONS ” OF OUR PARTY THE “LIQUIDATIONIST ” AND “NATIONAL ” QUESTIONS In August 1912 the Executive Committee of the Social-Democracy of Poland and Lithuania convened a “territorialconference” 148 of the Polish Social-Democrats. 
 It will be recalled that at present the Executive of the Polish Social-Democracy is an executive without a party. 
 In Warsaw, the Polish capital, the local Social-Democratic organisation em-phatically condemned the disorganising policy of the Exec-utive, which replied by resorting to vile anonymous ac-cusations of provocation, set up a fictitious Warsaw organ-isation and hastened to convene a suitably rigged territo-rial conference “of its own”. 
 Subsequent elections to the Duma by the Warsaw worker curia fully revealed the spurious character of the support-ers of the Executive: among the 66 delegates there were34 Social-Democrats, including only 3 (doubtful) supportersof the Executive. 
 This introductory remark is necessary for the reader to regard the resolution of the territorial conference of the S. 
D. 
P. 
 and L. 
 that we are going to discuss only as a resolution of the Tyszka Executive, and under no circum-stances as a decision of the Polish worker Social-Democrats. 
 I The question of the Polish Social-Democrats’ attitude towards the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 is an unusually important and burn-ing one. 
 Therefore the decision adopted by the Tyszka con-ference on this question, however hard it may be to take it seriously , deserves closer study. 
 It is hard to take seriously the Tyszka resolution, which is full of abuse, if only because of its attitude to the funda-mental question, that of liquidationism. 
 This has been a fundamental question in the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 during 1908-1912. 
 The Party has been terribly broken upby the counter-revolution. 
 It is making every effort to re-establish its organisation. 
 And throughout the four years of counter-revolution, it has been waging a continuous struggle against the little groups of Social-Democrats whowant to liquidate the Party. 
 Does it not follow clearly from this that one who has not settled the issue of liquidationism explicitly has no right to call himself a Party member? The Tyszka conference, too, in its resolution on the at-titude to the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 allotted more space to liquida-tionism than to anything else. 
 The conference admitted thatliquidationism was “a most serious obstacle to the develop-ment of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 and a grave danger to its very existence”. 
 “Overt and consistent liquidationism and revolutionary Social-Democracy are mutually exclusive,” said the resolu-tion. 
 As you see, Tyszka and Co. 
 tackled the problem with a bold and firm hand—and dodged solving it! Who are, then, the “overt and consistent” liquidators? And what is the practical conclusion that follows from theexperience of four years of struggle against liquidationism? These natural and necessary questions were answered in clear, precise and convincing terms by the January 1912Conference of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
, which said that the liquida-tors were the group associated with the publications Nasha Zarya and Zhivoye Dyelo . 
 This group had placed itself out-side the Party. 
 One may consider this answer right or wrong, but one cannot deny that it is quite clear, one cannot evade makinga clear statement of one’s attitude! But the Tyszka conference sought precisely to evade the issue, twist and turn like a petty thief. 
 If it is not truethat Nasha Zarya represents open and consistent liquida-tors, as we said clearly in January 1912, then why did Tysz-ka and Co. 
 not disclose our error to the Polish worker So-cial-Democrats in August 1912? If it is not true that Nasha Zarya has placed itself outside the Party, and if you, Messrs. 
 Tyszka, Rosa Luxemburg and Warski, consider it to be in the Party , why did not you say so plainly? It was your direct duty to the Polish worker Social-Democrats! And however much you may abuse and curse and revile “Lenin’s” conference in January 1912, the racket you are raising will not enable you to deceive anyone but peoplewho want to be deceived. 
 For, after the January Conference,one cannot be a politically-conscious and honest Social-Democrat, nor speak of the state of affairs in the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
,without giving a clear and explicit answer to the question: is Nasha Zarya liquidationist or not, and does it belong in or outside the Party? II The spate of varied and wordy abuse which the Tyszka conference slung at the “Leninists” boils down to one thing —an accusation of splitting the Party. 
 The January Conference of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 considered only the Nasha Zarya group to be outside the Party. 
 This is a fact known to all. 
 From this fact even Tyszka and hisfriends could have drawn the simple and obvious conclusion that the accusation of splitting the Party means regarding the Nasha Zarya group as a Party group. 
 Even a child would see that this conclusion is inevitable. 
 And Tyszka and Co. 
 are long past childhood years. 
 Anyone who accuses us of splitting the Party should have sufficient elementary courage and elementary honesty to say plainly: “The Nasha Zarya group is not liquidation-ist”, “it ought not to be outside the Party, but belongs inside the Party”, “it is a legitimate shade of opinion i n the Party”, and so on. 
 This is the heart of the matter, that the gentlemen who accuse us of splitting the Party, such as Tyszka, say this in undertones , shyly, in a roundabout way (for this natu-rally follows from the howls about a split) but they are afraid to say it plainly! It is not easy to say and prove that Nasha Zarya ought to be in the Party. 
 Anyone who says so assumes a certain responsibility, decides a certain question of principle, and plainly defends the chief liquidators. 
 One may (and should) regard such a person as a supporter of the liquidators, butone must admit that he has his convictions and it cannot bedenied that he is politically honest, if only within thelimits of the narrow question whether or not a definite group of liquidators should be in the Party. 
 But when an entire organisation, if one may call it that, or a sum total of the organisations of a whole territory,dodgingly and stealthily, shamefacedly and without speak-ing straight out, defends the liquidators and accuses thosewho have expelled the liquidators from the Party of causing a split, but does not dare to say plainly, “This group of liquidators ought to be in the Party”, the conclusion inev-itably suggests itself that what we have before us is notan organisation of Social-Democrats who share such-and-such views, but a circle of plotters who want to make political capital out of “utilising” the struggle between the liquida-tors and the anti-liquidators. 
 To those who are familiar with the internal affairs of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 since 1907, it has long been an open secretthat Tyszka and Co. 
, like the Bundists who preceded them,are specimens of this type of intriguer, “Marxists by weight”,or “Tushino turncoats ”, 149 as Social-Democrats call such people. 
 Tyszka, like some of the Bundists, bases his entire “stand” in the Party on a game between the liquidators and the anti-liquidators, on mediation, on profiting from beingthe extra “weight in the scales”, without which neither theliquidators nor the anti-liquidators can have a majority! In the autumn of 1911, when this old “game” of Tyszka’s, of which everyone had grown tired, resulted in his collapse, he was openly called a plotter by the press of both opposed trends—the liquidators and the anti-liquidators. 
 Indeed, place yourself in the position of an extra “weight in the scales”, and then the illogical, childishly naïve,ludicrously feeble and helpless resolutions of the Tyszka conference will at once become perfectly intelligible to you. 
 This is just the way a plotter should speak: I condemnliquidationism—but I don’t say plainly who are the overt and consistent liquidators! I admit that liquidationism endangers the very existence of the Party—but I don’t say plainly whether or not such-and-such a group ought to be in the Party! I can always , under all circumstances, derive an advantage from a “position” such as this, can make “po-litical capital” out of it, for without me the anti-liquidator cannot defeat the liquidator, without me the liquidator can-not have an assured place in the Party!! “Tyszka” politics are not an accidental or isolated phe-nomenon. 
 When there is a split and, in general, when thereis a bitter struggle between trends, it is inevitable that groups should appear which base their existence on a con-tinuous darting from one side to the other, and on pettyintrigue. 
 This is a sad and unpleasant feature of the life of our Party, a feature accentuated by the conditions of revo-lutionary work in exile. 
 Groups of intriguers, and featuresof intrigue in the policy of certain groups, particularlythose lacking strong ties with Russia, are phenomena onehas to be aware of if one does not want to be fooled andto fall victim to various “misunderstandings”. 
 III The slogan of “unity” is “popular”, of course, among wide sections of the workers, who do not know with whom that unity should be established, what concessions to a par-ticular group that unity implies, and on what basis the policy of including the liquidators in the Party or expellingthem from it is shaped. 
 To be sure, nothing could be easier than demagogically taking advantage of this incomprehension of the essence of the matter to howl about a “split”. 
 Nothing could be easier than disguising diplomacy by a demand for the “unity” of trends that have irrevocably drifted apart. 
 But however “popular” the slogan of “unity” among polit-ically-ignorant people, and however convenient it is nowfor various demagogues, intriguers and group diplomatsto hide behind it, we shall never stop demanding from every politically-conscious Social-Democrat a clear and explicit answer to the question decided by the January 1912 Con-ference of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 The conference which the liquidators convened in Au-gust 1912 showed clearly that all the controversies turn on the question of liquidationism, on whether the liquida-tors’ groups are pro-Party or non-Party (or even anti-Party). 
Whoever evades this cardinal issue mystifies himself andothers. 
 As a matter of fact, talk about the “factionalism” of the January Conference, and so on, is just such an evasion of the cardinal issue. 
 All right, gentlemen, we might an-swer the talkers, let us assume that the January Conferencewas arch-factionalist and disruptive, that it was not dulyauthorised, and so on. 
 But are you not using these “terriblewords” merely to clear yourselves in your own eyes ? A section of the Social-Democrats—it makes no difference which—de-clared in January that Nasha Zarya consisted of anti-Party liquidators who were outside the Party. 
 That opinion issubstantiated in a resolution—a detailed, well-groundedresolution prompted by four years of Party history. 
 Anyone who sincerely wishes to explain and refute the error of these, let us say, “January” Social-Democrats must analyse and refute this resolution. 
 He must say and prove that Nasha Zarya should be in the Party, that its ideas are not ruinous to the Party, that such-and-suchconcessions should be made to that group, that such-and-such obligations should be demanded of it, that the guar-antees of the fulfilment of these obligations should con-sist in this or that, and that the extent of the influence of the group within the Party should be established in such-and-such a way. 
 To put the question in this way would mean conscien-tiously and honestly refuting the convictions of the JanuarySocial-Democrats, would mean explaining to the workers what you think wrong. 
 But the point is that not one o f those who now engage in cheap clamour about a split hastaken a single step towards putting the question in thisway!! That is why, contemptuously brushing aside the dema-gogues and intriguers, we calmly repeat: our resolution expelling the liquidators has not been refuted and is irref-utable. 
 New facts, such as the publication of the liquida-tionist Luch , 150 which has made Trotsky’s phrase-mongering its own, merely increase the force of our resolution a hun-dred-fold. 
 The facts—the May Day action, the rallying of hundreds of workers’ groups around the anti-liquida-tionist newspaper, the elections to the Fourth Duma bythe worker curia—are conclusive proof of the correctness of our stand against the liquidators. 
 No amount of howling about a “split” can shake this conviction, because this howling is a cowardly, covert, hypocritical defence of the liquidators. 
 IV The January 1912 Conference of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 posed yet another serious question of principle, that of the struc-ture of our Party with regard to nationalities. 
 For lack of space, I shall only briefly touch on this question. 
 Complete or incomplete federation, “federation of the worst type” or complete unity? That is the question. 
 The Tyszka conference replies to this problem, too, with nothing but abuse and shouts about “fraud”, “distor-tion of the facts”, and so on. 
 What senseless shouters theyare, this Tyszka and his retinue! The complete separateness of the Lettish, Polish and Jewish (Bund) Social-Democrats is a fact. 
 Every PolishSocial-Democrat knows that there is not, and has never been, anything like unity with the Bund in Poland. 
 The same is true of the Russians and the Bund, etc. 
 The non-Russians have their own special organisations, their centralbodies, congresses, etc. 
 The Russians lack these things , and their Central Committee cannot decide Russian ques-tions without the participation of the Bundists, Poles and Letts who are fighting one another and who are unfamiliar with Russian matters. 
 This is a fact, one that no amount of abuse can suppress. 
 Everyone in our Party has seen it since 1907. 
 Everyone has sensed the falsity of this situation. 
 That is why our Con-ference dubbed it “ a federation of the worst type ”. 
 * *See present edition, Vol. 
 17, pp. 
 464-65. 
— Ed. 
 All honest and sincere Social-Democrats must give a pertinent answer to this presentation of the question. 
 The correctness of this presentation of the question was borne out most convincingly by the August conference, which, as even Plekhanov admits, “adapted socialism to nationalism” by its notorious resolution on “national cu-tural” autonomy. 
 The Bund and Tyszka’s Executive are alike in swear-ing by all the saints that they stand for unity, while in Warsaw, Lodz and elsewhere there is a complete split be-tween them !! The connection between the “liquidationist question” and the “national question” is not an invention of ours buthas been revealed by the realities of life. 
 Let, then, all serious-minded Social-Democrats raise and discuss the “national question” as well. 
 Federationor unity? Federation for the “nationalities”, with separatecentres and without a separate centre for the Russians, or complete unity? Nominal unity with a virtual split (orsecession) of the Bund’s local organisations, or real unity from top to bottom? Anyone who thinks he can get away from these questions is sorely mistaken. 
 Anyone who counts on a simple restora-tion of the “federation of the worst type” of 1907-11, mys-tifies himself and others . 
 It is already impossible to restore that federation. 
 That misbegotten child will never rise from the dead. 
 The Party has moved away from it for good. 
 Where has it moved to? Towards an “Austrian” federa-tion? 151 Or towards a complete renunciation of federation, to actual unity? We are for the latter. 
 We are opposed to“adapting socialism to nationalism”. 
 Let everyone give full thought to this question and finally decide it.

 Lenin CONCERNING CERTAIN SPEECHES BY WORKER S’ DEPUTIE S152 What are the basic ideas that should underlie the first speech of a workers’ spokesman in the Duma? Naturally, the workers will look forward to the first speech with particular eagerness and particular attention. 
 Naturally, it is in the first speech that they expect to findthe important and fundamental thing, a concise expositionof the view taken on issues that are of especial concernto everyone and come particularly into the forefront in the country’s policies in general and in the practice of the working-class movement (both political and economic ) in particular. 
 Among these issues are the following: (1)Continuity of the activity of the Social-Democratic group in the Fourth Duma. 
 Continuity implies the pre-servation of an inseparable connection with the former Social-Democratic groups of all the former Dumas, it being particularly necessary to stress the connection with theSocial-Democratic group in the Second Duma—in view ofthe well-known attack which the counter-revolution madeupon it. 
 It is important to lay stress on continuity, for, unlike the bourgeois parties, the worker democrats see somethingintegral and common in their work in the First, Second, Third and Fourth Dumas, and will not let themselves bedistracted by any turn in events (or by any developmentlike the coup d’état of June 3) from fulfilling their tasks, from pursuing their invariable aims. 
 (2) The second thesis which should go into the first speech of a workers’ deputy is socialism. 
 Strictly speaking, it consists of two subjects. 
 One is the fact that Russia’s Social-Democratic Party is a contingent of the international army of the socialist proletariat. 
 That, in fact, is exactly what Pokrovsky said in the Third Duma (see his declara-tion in the verbatim reports, p. 
 328 of the official publica-tion, Seventh Sitting, November 16, 1907). 
 It is, of course,absolutely indispensable to make this point. 
 But there is another point which is highly important in our day. 
 It is a reference to the present situation and the tasks of socialism throughout the world. 
 What are the characteristics of this situation? (a) An extreme aggrava-tion of the struggle between the working class and thebourgeoisie (high cost of living, mass strikes, the imperial-ism of the Powers, their fierce competition over markets and their nearness to war), and (b) the nearness of the real-isation of socialism. 
 The working class of the world isfighting not for recognition of its right to have a socialistparty, but for power , and for the organisation of society along new lines. 
 It is highly important to say so from theDuma platform, to tell the workers of Russia about the beginning of the great battles for socialism in Europe and America, about the nearness of the triumph (inevitable triumph) of socialism in the civilised world. 
 (3) The third thesis concerns the Balkan war and Rus-sia’s international position and foreign policy. 
It is impossible to omit this subject, which is the most topical. 
 It may be subdivided into the following questions: (a) The Balkan war. 
 The slogan of a Balkan federal republic should also be proclaimed by the Russian workers’ deputy. 
 Against Slav-Turkish enmity. 
 For freedom and equal rights for all the peoples of the Balkans. 
 (b) Against the interference of other Powers in the Balkan war. 
 It is absolutely necessary to side with the demonstra-tion for peace which took place in Basle, at the Interna-tional Socialist Congress . 
 153 War against war! Against all interference! For peace! Such are the slogans of the workers. 
 (c) Against the foreign policy of the Russian Government in general, with particular mention of the “lust” to seize(and of the seizure already begun) the Bosphorus, TurkishArmenia, Persia, Mongolia. 
 First page of Lenin’s manuscript “Concerning Certain Speeches by Workers’ Deputies”. 
 November 1912 Reduced First page of Lenin’s manuscript “Concerning Certain Speeches by Workers’ Deputies”. 
 November 1912 Reduced (d) Against the nationalism of the government, with reference to the oppressed nationalities: Finland, Poland, the Ukraine, the Jews, etc. 
 It is highly important to put forward in precise terms the slogan of the political self-determination of all nationalities, in contrast to all hedg-ing (such as only “equality”). 
 (e) Against liberal nationalism, which is not so crude but is particularly harmful because of its hypocrisy and its “refined” deception of the people. 
 What are the signs of this liberal (Progressist-Cadet ) nationalism? Chauvinist speeches about the tasks of the “Slavs”, speeches about thetasks of Russia as a “Great Power”, speeches about Russiareaching an agreement with Britain and France so as to beable to plunder other countries. 
 (4) The fourth thesis is the political position of Russia. 
 The essential thing here is to describe the existing tyrannyand lack of rights, and reveal the compelling necessity of political liberty. 
 Special note should be made here of: (a) The necessity of mentioning the prisons—Kutomara, Algachi, etc. 
 154 (b) A reference to the rigging of elections, Bonapartist methods, the fact that the government is no longer trustedeven by those classes (the landlords and the bourgeoisie)on which the coup d’état of June 3 counted. 
 The priests were made to vote against their con-science. 
 The Duma has moved to the right, while the country has moved to the left. 
 (c) It is particularly important to state correctly the relationship between the notorious liquidationist sloganof “freedom of association” and the objectives of political liberty in general. 
 It is highly important to point out that freedom of the press, association, assembly and strikes isabsolutely indispensable to the workers, but that it is pre-cisely in order to bring it about that we must realise the inseparable connection between it and the general founda-tions of political liberty, a radical change in the entire political system. 
 Not the liberal utopia of freedom of asso-ciation under the June Third regime, but a struggle for freedom in general, and for freedom of association in particular, against this regime all along the line, against the foundations of this regime. 
 (5) Fifth thesis: the intolerable plight of the peasantry. 
 The starvation of 30 million peasants in 1911. 
 The ruinand impoverishment of the countryside. 
 The government“land distribution system” only makes things worse . 
 Finan-cial prosperity is so much tinsel, a pretence of prosperityachieved by extorting dues and befuddling the people with drink. 
 Even the modest land Bill of the Right-wing peas-ants (the “forty-three peasants”) submitted to the ThirdDuma 155 has been shelved. 
 The peasants need deliverance from the oppression of the landlords and of landlordism. 
 (6) Sixth thesis: three camps in the elections to the Fourth Duma, and three camps in the country: (a) The government camp. 
 It is impotent. 
 Rigs elections. 
 (b) The liberal camp. 
 It is highly important to point out, if only very briefly, the counter-revolutionary natureof the liberals, who are against a new revolution. 
 One may quote word for word Gredeskul’s statement which Pravda reprinted in its issue No. 
 85 (August 8). 
 * “No second popu-lar movement [in other words, no second revolution] was needed but merely quiet, persevering and confident con-stitutional work”. 
 These were Gredeskul’s exact words,and Rech published them. 
 Liberal hopes of constitutional reform with the founda-tions of the present system retained, and without a broad movement of the people, are utopia . 
 (c) The third camp, the democrats. 
 It is led by the work-ing class. 
 One may say, speaking of the past in the thirdperson, what was said even by Golos Moskvy , namely, that the working class advanced three slogans during the elec-tions: (1) a democratic republic; (2) an eight-hour working day; (3) confiscation of all the landed estates in favour of the peasantry. 
 (7) Seventh thesis: a reference to the political movement and strikes in 1912. 
 (a) It is highly important to point out that the number of political strikers rose to a million. 
 Resurgence of the entire emancipation movement. 
 *See pp. 
 254-55 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 (b) It is highly important to stress that the workers by their political strikes set themselves objectives affecting the whole people , that they did not raise particular prob-lems but problems affecting the whole people . 
 (c) It is necessary to point out that it is the connection between political and economic strikes that lends strengthand vitality to the movement. 
 (d) Mention the workers’ protest against the execution of sailors. 
 (8) The eighth thesis, an important one following from the whole of the foregoing and closely linked with it, isthe hegemony of the proletariat, its guiding role, its roleas leader. 
 It leads the whole people, the entire democraticmovement. 
 It demands freedom and leads into the battle for freedom. 
 It sets an example, provides a model. 
 It raises morale. 
 It arouses a new mood. 
 (9) The ninth and final thesis: recapitulation and sum-mary. 
 It should be said, speaking of the class-consciousworkers in the third person, that they are “unshakablyloyal” to three principles: first, socialism; second, “the principles of the old, battle-tested Russian Social-Demo-cratic Labour Party”—the workers are loyal to it. 
 Thisfact should be conveyed; third, the workers are loyal to “their republican convictions”. 
 It is not a question of anappeal or slogan, but of loyalty to one’s convictions. 
 (Thereexist legal republican parties in a number of monarchies— Britain, Sweden, Italy, Belgium and other countries. 
) P. 
S. 
 The question may also arise of the need to put for-ward separately “freedom of association”. 
 It should be borne in mind that the liquidators advocate under thisflag the liberal demand for a constitutional reform while keeping intact the foundations of the June Third— * Written in November 1912 First published in Lenin’s Published according Collected Works , Second and to the manuscript Third editions, Vol.

 CONCERNING THE WORKERS ’ DEPUTIES TO THE DUM A AND THEI R DECLARATIO N156 The Social-Democratic group, speaking from the plat-form of the Fourth Duma, declares that there is an insepa-rable continuity between its activity and that of the So-cial-Democratic groups in the previous Dumas, particularlythe one in the Second Duma, a group against which thecounter-revolutionaries committed an act of unprecedentedpolitical vengeance. 
 The Russian Social-Democratic Partyis a contingent of the great international liberation army of the socialist proletariat. 
 This army is now growing rapidly throughout the world. 
 The universal high cost ofliving, the oppression of capital grouped in associations,cartels, trusts and syndicates, and the imperialist policiesof the Powers make the condition of the working massesintolerable and aggravate the struggle between capital and labour. 
 The time is fast approaching when an end will be put to capitalism, when millions of united proletarianswill establish a social system in which there will be nopoverty of the masses, nor exploitation of man by man. 
 The Social-Democratic group joins its voice to that of the workers of all countries, who at the International Con-gress in Basle expressed an emphatic protest against war. 
 The workers demand peace. 
 They protest against all inter-ference in Balkan affairs. 
 Only complete freedom and inde-pendence of the Balkan peoples, and only a federal Balkanrepublic are capable of providing the best way out of thepresent crisis and a real solution to the national question through the recognition of complete equality and an abso-lute right to political self-determination for all nationali-ties without exception. 
 The Social-Democratic group in the Fourth Duma pro-tests above all against the foreign policy of the Russian Government. 
 It condemns the hidden intention to enlarge our state by seizing foreign territories on the Bosphorus,in Turkish Armenia, in Persia and China, and condemns theseizure of Mongolia, which disrupts good relations withthe great, fraternal Chinese Republic. 
 All chauvinism and nationalism will find an implacable enemy in the Social-Democratic group—whether the crude, brutal nationalism of the government which crushes andstrangles Finland, Poland, the Ukraine, the Jews and theother non-Great-Russian nationalities, or the hypocriti-cally disguised, refined nationalism of the liberals andCadets, who are willing to talk about the tasks of Russia as a Great Power and about an agreement between her and other Powers with the aim of plundering foreign lands. 
 The ruling classes resort to noisy nationalist speeches in a vain effort to divert the attention of the people fromthe intolerable domestic position of Russia. 
 The unheard-of rigging of the Fourth Duma elections, which is reminis-cent of the Bonapartist methods of that adventurer, Napo-leon III, has shown for the hundredth and thousandth timethat the government cannot rely for support upon any oneclass of the population. 
 It cannot even maintain its alli-ance with the landlords and the big bourgeoisie, for the sakeof which the coup d’état of June 3, 1907, was carried out. 
 The Duma has swung to the right while the whole country has moved to the left. 
 The whole of Russia is suffocating under the yoke of oppression and tyranny. 
 The entire civilised world hearswith startled indignation of the tortures and the sufferingof political prisoners in the Kutomara, Algachi and other prisons, where the finest people of our country are languish-ing in torment. 
 Russia needs political liberty as badly asman needs air to breathe. 
 Russia cannot live and developunless there is freedom of the press, assembly, associationand strikes, and, more than to any other class, these li-berties are indispensable to the proletariat, which the lack of rights typical of Russian reality binds hand and foot in the fight it must carry on for higher wages, shorterworking hours and better living conditions. 
 The oppression of capital, the high cost of living, unemployment in the towns and the impoverishment of the countryside make it all the more necessary for the workers to associate in unions and fight for their right to live, while lack of polit-ical liberty keeps the worker in the position of a slave orserf. 
 The workers will stop at no sacrifice in their strugglefor freedom, well knowing that only a radical change inall the political conditions of Russian life, only the fullest provision of the foundations and pillars of political liberty, can guarantee the freedom of their struggle against capital. 
 The elections to the Fourth Duma and the workers’ mass political strikes in 1912, which involved up to a mil-lion workers, showed that the time is drawing near whenthe workers will again march at the head of all democrats to win freedom. 
 Three camps tested their strength in the election struggle. 
 The camp of government counter-revolu-tion proved so impotent that it had to rig the electionseven under the law of June 3, compelling the downtroddenrural priests to vote against their conscience and convic-tions. 
 The liberal camp moved still further from the demo-crats towards the big bourgeoisie. 
 The Cadets demonstrated their counter-revolutionary nature by an alliance withthe Black Hundreds against the Social-Democrats in Rigaand Yekaterinodar, in Kostroma and the first St. 
 Peters-burg curia. 
 The liberal utopia of constitutional reform,with the foundations of the present political system un-changed and without a powerful movement of the people, is more and more losing favour among the democrats. 
 Theslogan of the liberals is: “There is no need for a second rev-olution, what is needed is merely constitutional work. 
”Being fully aware of the spuriousness of this slogan, theworking class waged its struggle in the elections, rallying all the democratic forces to itself. 
 Everyone knows, and even the government press said so, that the working class had three slogans in the electioncampaign: a democratic republic, an eight-hour workingday, and confiscation of all the landed estates in favour ofthe peasants. 
 The Social-Democratic proletariat is convinced that these three demands are the necessary culmination of thedemands shared by every democrat, such as universal suf-frage, freedom of the press, assembly, association and strikes, the election of judges and government officials by the people, abolition of the standing army and introduction of a people’s militia, disestablishment of the Church andseparation of the school from the Church, etc. 
 The condition of the peasant masses in Russia is becom-ing more and more intolerable. 
 The government’s so-called“land distribution system” merely worsens the plight of the majority by ruining the countryside, leading to famine such as affected 30 million peasants last year, and bring-ing no lasting improvement of agriculture in general. 
The pretence of financial prosperity is kept up by extort-ing taxes and befuddling the population with drink, whilethe government delays its bankruptcy by contracting more and more loans. 
 Even the modest land Bill submitted to the Duma by the forty-three Right-wing peasants hasbeen shelved. 
 No wonder the better section of the peasantryis looking more and more to the working class as the onlyleader of the people in the struggle for freedom. 
 No wonderall democrats regard the political strikes of 1912, which are inseparably linked with the economic movement of the working class, as the dawn of a new life, of a new morepowerful emancipation movement. 
 The Social-Democratic group in the Fourth Duma will champion the interests and needs of this movement. 
 Itconsiders that it has no right to conceal from the majority in the Fourth Duma what all the class-conscious workers of Russia are thinking and feeling. 
 The class-consciousworkers remain unshakably loyal to socialism. 
 They re-main unshakably loyal to the principles of the old, battle-tested Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party. 
 In thename of these principles, they remain unshakably loyal to their republican convictions.

 Krupskaya CONCERNING THE EVENT OF NOVEMBER 15 AN UNDELIVERED SPEECH On November 15 the Fourth Duma opened. 
 And on November 15 there was a demonstration of workers inSt. 
 Petersburg. 
 157 In view of previous political strikes, and because of them, this demonstration had the importance of a major historical event. 
 The strikes led up to demon-strations. 
 The movement of the masses rose to a higherplane—from strikes of a political nature to street demon-strations. 
 This is a great step forward, which should bestressed, noted and estimated at its true worth by all polit-ically enlightened leaders of the proletariat. 
 The significance of this step forward is all the greater because it coincided with the opening of the Fourth, land-lord, Black-Hundred, June Third Duma. 
 A perfectly timeddemonstration! Wonderful proletarian instinct, the abilityto counter and contrast the opening of the Black-Hundred “parliament” with red banners in the streets of the capital! Wonderful proletarian instinct, the ability to counter the sycophantic, slavish, Cadet-Octobrist “demonstration”(over Rodzyanko’s wretched phrase-mongering about a“constitution” 158) inside the Palace by a demonstration of the real kind, a truly popular, truly democratic, purely labour demonstration (the intelligentsia, unfortunately, was absent, if we are to trust the newspapers). 
 Sycophantic chatter about a “constitution” (or pie in the sky à la Rodzyanko) inside the Black-Hundred Duma and a specimen of the incipient struggle for freedom anda people’s representative assembly (without inverted com-mas), for a republic, outside the Duma—this contrast revealed the deep and unerring instinct of the revolutionarymasses. 
 The fact that the liberal and liquidationist Luch “warned” against such a demonstration is worthy of traitors to the working-class cause. 
 But how could the Social-Democratic group “warn”? How could it stoop to the level of Cadets—to a slavishlevel? How did it happen that individual members of itsubmitted, and accepted such infamy? The supposition arises—one that is sometimes put for-ward “in private”—that perhaps there were fears of a provocation in one of the groups “calling for” the demon-stration? Let us assume for a moment that this supposition was made. 
 Does it exonerate the Social-Democratic group? No. 
Or, to be exact, it justifies the group’s move from a per-sonal point of view, but not politically . 
 It exonerates the Social-Democratic Duma group from the suspicion of be-trayal of the workers’ cause, but not from the accusationof a political error. 
 Indeed, what would a workers ’ deputy, a real workers’ deputy, have done had he, after three days of news about preparations for a demonstration of this kind, heard on the last day the “rumour” (which might have been provocativetoo): “Is there some provocation here?” The workers’ deputy would have found his way to seve-ral influential workers. 
 He would have realised that atsuch a time his place was alongside the prominent workers, that it was a hundred times more important to be there with the workers than at the meetings of the Duma group. 
He would have learned from the prominent workers, fromtwo or three (or perhaps four or five) influential workers of the capital, how matters stood , what the workers thought about it, and what the mood of the masses was. 
 The workers’ deputy would have made inquiries about these things—he would have known how to make inquiries about them, and would have learnt that there was to be astrike (15 to 50 thousand!! according to the bourgeois press), that there was to be a demonstration, that the workerswere not thinking of violence and disorders, and that, consequently , the rumour about a provocation was no more than a silly rumour. 
 The workers’ deputy would have found out these things, and would not have let himself be deceived by the terrified petty liberal intellectuals of the infamous “initiating group”. 
 Rumours of a provocation. 
 All right. 
 But were there no rumours during the Gaponiad? A fine worker or workers’leader one would have been had one been unable to dis-tinguish between the incipient peculiar awakening of themasses during the Gaponiad and the agent provocateur Gapon, or the police agents provocateurs who urged Gapon on!! Let us assume that the police and agents provocateurs had a hand in the preparations for the demonstration onNovember 15. 
 Let us (although it has not been proved andis incredible; it is more likely that what was a provocation was the rumours about a provocation). 
 But let us assume it was so. 
 What of it? One must not resort to violence when there has been no question of it. 
One must warn against violence. 
 But to warn against apeaceful strike at a time when the masses are seething ? To warn against a demonstration ?? It is a very, very sad mistake the Social-Democratic Duma group as a whole has made. 
 And it would be gratify-ing to learn that this mistake was not made by all, and thatmany of those who did make it realise their mistake andwill not repeat it. 
 The movement of the proletariat in Russia (whatever the police tricks anywhere) has risen to a higher plane .

 STALI N159 Dear friend, local Polish papers report that Jagiello has been admitted into the group, and has been granted a voice but no vote. 
160 If that is true, it is a definite vic-tory for the Party principle. 
 In view of the agitation car-ried on by Luch , it is necessary: (1) To publish an article in Dyen161 (I am sending a draft today), ... in the Collegi-um162 (we must by all means teach them—doing so while they are with us here—to respond to everything with resolu-tions and immediately send copies of them here). 
 Hereis a tentative draft of such a resolution: “Having examined all the circumstances of Jagiello’s admission into the Social-Democratic group, having studied the articles aboutit in the Marxist organ, Pravda , and in the newspaper of the liquidators, Luch , and taken into account So-and-So’s report on the debate about it in the Social-DemocraticDuma group and on the opinions of the various Social-Democratic organisations of Russia, the Collegium resolves: to recognise that the refusal to admit Jagiello withthe right to vote was the only proper way out from thepoint of view of Party principle, since Jagiello is not amember of the Social-Democratic Party and was electedto the Fourth Duma against the will of the majority of the electors in the worker curia of the city of Warsaw. 
 The Collegium condemns the anti-Party agitation carried onby the Bund and the liquidators in favour of admittingJagiello into the group and expresses the hope that the grant-ing of a consultative voice to Deputy Jagiello may helpin rallying all the class-conscious Polish workers closer around the Polish Social-Democrats and in merging them completely with the workers of all nationalities into in-tegral organisations of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
” If, contrary to expectations, the liquidators have won and Jagiello has been admitted, it is still necessary, and doubly so, to have a resolution similar in content, express-ing regret and appealing to the Party as a whole. 
 It is highly important, furthermore, for the Collegium to “correct itself” on the well-known resolution of Novem-ber 13 and adopt a new one. 
 Something like this: “Hav-ing examined all the circumstances of the strike of Novem-ber 15, the Collegium finds that the warnings against the strike both from the Social-Democratic group and fromthe St. 
 Petersburg Committee were prompted solely by thefact that part of the organisation was not ready to go intoaction on that day. 
 However, events showed that nonethe-less the movement of the revolutionary proletariat assumed a large scale and developed into street demonstrations in the name of a republic, an eight-hour working day,and confiscation of the landed estates, thus raising the entireworking-class movement in Russia to a higher plane. 
 There-fore the Collegium emphatically condemns the propagandaagainst revolutionary strikes which the liquidators, their ... group and Luch are carrying on, and recommends the workers to devote all their efforts to more extensive, thor-ough and concerted preparations for street demonstrationsand political protest strikes, which should be made asshort as possible (one-day) and concerted. 
 The Collegiumwill try to develop a campaign for a strike and demon-stration on January 9, 1913, with a special protest against the 300th anniversary of the House of Romanov, whichenslaves Russia and drenches her in blood. 
” Next, it is highly important and essential for the five (curia) deputies to draft a well-grounded resolution onthe Badayev case. 
 Something like this: “The five deputies from the worker curia, having considered the baiting of Comrade Badayev by the liquidators in Luch and among the St. 
 Petersburg workers, have resolved: (1) not to submitthis matter to the Duma group, since the latter has admittedBadayev and no objection was raised in the group to hisadmission; (2) to investigate the conditions of Badayev’s election, provided he abstains from voting on this matter; (3) the fact, established and verified by the five deputies,that (a) the anti-liquidationist mandate was printed before-hand, and was adopted unanimously by the delegates’ meeting, all the electors and delegates who backed Badayev acting in concert and unity and as staunch fellow-thinkers, at the request of the St. 
 Petersburg Committee of theR. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
; (b) that at the meeting of the Social-Democraticdelegates fifteen persons voted for the St. 
 Petersburg Com-mittee’s list and nine for the liquidators and that not all ofthe delegates and electors of Luch behaved as fellow-thinkers of the liquidators, some of them (Sudakov and others) vacillating; (c) that when three electors had been electedfrom each side, Badayev’s supporters did their duty bymoving that the matter be settled by drawing lots to pre-vent the dispute from being revealed to the bourgeoisie;(d) that the very fact that Badayev’s supporters tabled this motion and the fact that the liquidators refused ... the question of P. 
 and M. 
 163 (a liquidator)—therefore we have resolved: to recognise that Badayev is undoubtedly theelected representative of the majority of the worker Social-Democrats of St. 
 Petersburg and is in fact a candidate atthe request of the St. 
 Petersburg Committee; that the entire responsibility for the disorganisation of the Social-Democratic Party elections in the St. 
 Petersburg workercuria falls on the liquidators, who sought to frustrate thewill of the majority, knowing themselves to be in a minor-ity; and that the liquidators’ refusal to draw lots was anoutrageous violation of what is the duty of every Social-Democrat, 164 a violation unheard of in the working-class movement. 
 We have resolved to publish this resolution inthe press and to take concerted action among the workersfor Badayev and against liquidationist agitation. 
” This resolution is essential. 
 The Badayev case has al-ready got into the world press. 
 Steklov has printed evasive but foul things in Die Neue Zeit . 
 And what is contained in the pamphlet which the liquidators have published in theGerman language for the International Congress is simplypreposterous. 
 We cannot keep silent. 
 It is for the curiadeputies to check the facts and exonerate Badayev, withBadayev himself abstaining, of course.

 STALI N165 For Vasilyev December 6. 
 Dear friend, with regard to January 9, it is highly im-portant to think things over and make preparations in advance. 
 A leaflet must be prepared in advance calling formeetings, a one-day strike, and demonstrations (the latter should be decided on the spot, where it will be easier to decide). 
 166 We must “correct” the mistake of November 15—correct it against the opportunists, of course. 
 The slo-gans in the leaflet must be the three main revolutionaryones (a republic, an eight-hour working day, and confisca-tion of the landed estates), with special emphasis on the 300 years’ “infamy” of the Romanov dynasty. 
 If there is no com-plete and absolute certainty that we can have the leafletin St. 
 Petersburg, we must prepare it here beforehand andtake it there. 
 The liquidators’ impudence over Jagiello isunparalleled. 
 If all of our six representatives have beenelected by the worker curia, we must not tacitly submit to any Siberians. 
 The six must by all means voice the most emphatic protest if they are outvoted; they must printtheir protest in Dyen and declare that they are appealing to the rank and file, to the workers’ organisations. 
 The liqui-dators want to innate their majority and force througha split with the Polish Social-Democrats. 
 Is it possible that the workers’ representatives from six working-class gubernias will submit to the Skobelevs and Co. 
 or to achance Siberian 167? Write more often and in greater detail. 
 The Luch articles against strikes are the height of villainy. 
 We must come out sharply against them in the illegal press. 
 Let me know as soon as possible which of the plans made by you for such action you have chosen.

 Krupskaya THE DISEASE OF REFORMISM “What ails us?” was the question asked in a recent issue of Luch by the author of an instructive feuilleton under that heading, written under the influence of the strike of Novem-ber 15. 
 The answer is evident from the following two quotations: “It would appear to be obvious to those who lay claim to the role of leaders that the demand for the abolition of emergency regu-lations and for freedom of association is one thing, and is an objectof the struggle now and in the near future, while the alteration of theexisting system, which the appeal speaks of, is something else. 
 Thiscan be brought about not by playing at strikes, which is what wesee at present, but by stubborn, methodical work, by winning one position after another, by straining every nerve, by achieving per-fect organisation and drawing into this struggle the mass of the peopleand not merely the working class.... 
 “If we take an intelligent attitude towards our tasks, methodi-cally defend our interests and do not flare up today only to subsidetomorrow, we shall create for ourselves both strong trade union organ-isations and an open political party that no one will dare encroach upon. 
” These passages are enough for us to say to the author: you would do better, my dear fellow, to ask “what ails” you yourself. 
 And we will answer you: you are clearly suffering from reformism. 
 You are obsessed with a fixed idea, theidea of a Stolypin workers’ party. 
 It is a dangerous disease,and the Luch doctors’ cure will finish you off altogether. 
 The author very explicitly and deliberately advocates an “open political party” in contrast to the general demand for political liberty. 
 A comparison of the two passages quoted leaves no room for doubt on this score. 
 All evasionwould be useless here. 
 /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR We would ask the author: why is it that the “open party” of the opportunists among the petty-bourgeois democrats (the Popular Socialists of 1906) and the big-bourgeois liberals (the Cadets in 1906-07 and later) turned out to bea utopia while your “open” workers’ party is not utopian? You admit (or, at any rate, the “open” action in the elections made you admit) that the Cadets are counter-revolutionary, that they are not democrats, not a party of the masses at all, but a party of the well-to-do bourgeoisie, a party of the first curia. 
 And yet here are you, a “sober-minded, realistic politician”, an enemy of “flare-ups andfist-shaking”, putting forward, allegedly on behalf of theworkers, an “immediate” demand which turned out to beutopian, unattainable for the Cadets!! You are a great utopian, but your utopia is small, petty, and wretched. 
 You have unwittingly contracted a fashionable disease— there is such an epidemic just now!—the disease of dejec-tion, faint-heartedness, despair and lack of faith. 
 Andthat disease is pushing you into the pitfall of opportunism,for which Popular Socialists and Cadets alike have already paid the price of universal ridicule. 
 You consider the demand for abolishing the emergency regulations and for freedom of association to be topicaland realistic, “methodical” and “conscious”. 
 You areat variance with the Social Democrats radically, for theyunderstand the general conditions for achieving (and the seriousness of) such reforms. 
 You are substantially at one with the Progressists and the Octobrists, for these are thepeople who deceive themselves and others with meaning-less talk about reforms and “liberties” under existing con-ditions. 
 The Italian reformist Bissolati betrayed the work-ing class for the sake of the reforms promised by Giolitti, a liberal Minister, with the parties of all classes existing “openly”. 
 But you are betraying the working class for thesake of reforms that even the Izgoyevs and Bulgakovs do not expect from Makarov! You speak contemptuously of “playing at strikes”. 
 I am not in a position to answer you properly on that point here. 
 I shall merely point out briefly that it is not really clever to describe a profound historical movement as “play-ing”. 
 You are angry at strikes just as Novoye Vremya (see Neznamov’s article in the issue of November 17), the Izgo-yevs and the Bulgakovs are. 
 And the reason why you are angry is that reality mercilessly shatters your liberal il-lusions. 
 The mass of the workers fully recognise the needof organisation, system, preparation, and method, but yourstatements they treat with contempt, and will continue todo so. 
 The serious disease that has poisoned your system is due to a very widespread bacillus. 
 It is the bacillus of liberal labour policy, or, in other words, of liquidationism. 
 It isin the air. 
 But however angry you may be at the course ofevents in general and at November 15 in particular, thatcourse is proving deadly to the bacillus.

 Ilyin to the Pravda text IMPOVERISHMENT IN CAPITALIST SOCIETY Bourgeois reformists, who are echoed by certain oppor-tunists among the Social-Democrats, assert that there is no impoverishment of the masses taking place in capitalist society. 
 “The theory of impoverishment” is wrong, theysay, for the standard of living of the masses is improving,if slowly, and the gulf between the haves and have-notsis narrowing, not widening. 
 The falsity of such assertions has lately been revealed to the masses more and more clearly. 
 The cost of living is rising. 
 Wages, even with the most stubborn and most successful strike movement, are increasing much moreslowly than the necessary expenditure of labour power. 
And side by side with this, the wealth of the capitalistsis increasing at a dizzy rate. 
 Here are some data on Germany, where the workers’ condition is far better than in Russia, thanks to a higherstandard of culture, to freedom of strikes and association, to political liberty, to the millions of trade unionists andthe millions of readers of workers’ newspapers. 
 According to data furnished by bourgeois sociologists, who draw on official sources, wages in Germany have increased by an average of 25 per cent during the past 30years. 
 In the same period, the cost of living has gone up byat least 40 per cent!! Food, clothing, fuel and rent have all become more expensive. 
 The worker is becoming impoverished absolutely , i. 
e. 
, he is actually becoming poorer than before; he is com-pelled to live worse, to eat worse, to suffer hunger more,and to live in basements and attics. 
 But the relative impoverishment of the workers, i. 
e. 
, the diminution of their share in the national income, is still more striking. 
 The workers’ comparative share in capitalist society, which is fast growing rich, is dwindlingbecause the millionaires are becoming ever richer. 
 There is no income tax in Russia, and no data are avail-able on the growing wealth of the well-to-do classes ofsociety. 
 Our reality, which is even sadder, is shut off by a veil—the veil of ignorance and lack of publicity. 
 In Germany there are exact data on the wealth of the propertied classes. 
 In Prussia, for example, the first 10,000 million marks (5,000 million rubles) of taxable propertybelonged to 1,853 persons in 1902 and to 1,108 in 1908. 
 The number of the very rich has diminished. 
 Their wealth has increased—in 1902 each of them owned property worth 5,000,000 marks (2,500,000 rubles) on the average andin 1908, as much as 9,000,000 marks (4,500,000 rubles)! People speak of the “upper 10,000”. 
 In Prussia the “up-per 21,000” rich owned property valued at 13,500 millionmarks, while the taxable property of the remaining 1,300,000 owners was worth only 3,000 million marks. 
 Four of the wealthiest millionaires in Prussia (one prince, one duke and two counts) owned property worth 149 mil-lion marks in 1907 and 481 million marks in 1908. 
 Wealth in capitalist society is growing at an incredible rate—side by side with the impoverishment of the mass of the workers.

 to the Pravda text THE WORKING CLASS AND ITS “PARLIAMENTARY ” REPRESENTATIVES This is not the first time that Russia’s class-conscious workers have had to deal with a collective body of repre-sentatives of the working class in the Duma. 
 And each time such a body was formed in the Second, Third or Fourth Duma (we do not mention the First, which most of theSocial-Democrats boycotted), there was a discrepancy be-tween the views and trend of the majority of Social-Democrats and those of their representatives in the Duma. 
 There are exact data on this discrepancy as regards the Second Duma. 
 In the spring of 1907 it was established offi-cially and beyond question what were the views, tendenciesand trends or groups predominating in the Social-Demo-cratic Party and those in the Social-Democratic Dumagroup. 
 It was found that, by sending one delegate from every 500 worker Social-Democrats, the Bolsheviks at that time had 105 delegates, the Mensheviks 97 and those not belong-ing to either group 4. 
 168 The Bolsheviks had an obvious superiority. 
Among the non-Russian Social-Democrats, the Poles had 44 delegates, the Bundists 57 and the Letts 29. 
 As oppo-nents of opportunism, Menshevism and the Bund strongly predominated among the Letts at that time, the ratioof the “trends” among the non-Russians in general wassimilar to that among the “Russian” Social-Democrats. 
 Yet in the Duma group of the Social-Democrats at that time there were 36 Mensheviks and 18 Bolsheviks, with 12 Mensheviks and 11 Bolsheviks among the deputies elected by the worker curia. 
 169 It is obvious that the Mensheviks predominated. 
 Thus the balance of the “trends” in the Duma group was not the same as in the Social-Democratic movement but the direct opposite. 
 Is that an accident?No. 
 As a general rule, in all countries of the world the parliamentary representatives of the workers’ parties havea more opportunist composition than that of the workers’ parties themselves. 
 The reason is easy to see: firstly, all the electoral systems of the bourgeois countries, even the most democratic, in practice restrict suffrage for the workers, either by making it conditional on age (in Russia it has tobe 25 years), or on residence and permanence of work (sixmonths in Russia), etc. 
 And it is the young, more politi-cally-conscious and resolute sections of the proletariat that these restrictions generally hit hardest of all. 
 Secondly, under any suffrage in bourgeois society, the non-proletarian elements of the workers’ parties—officialsof workers’ unions, small proprietors, office employees,and particularly the “intelligentsia”—specialise more read-ily in the “parliamentary” profession (owing to their occupations, social standing, training, etc. 
). 
 What are the conclusions to be drawn from this fact, and how did matters stand in the Third and Fourth Dumascompared with the Second? We shall devote our next ar-ticle to these questions.

 to the Pravda text THE “RECONCILIATION ” OF THE NATIONALISTS AND CADETS The most important political result of the Duma debate on the declaration of the government is the touching unity of the nationalists , Octobrists and Cadets . 
 Our Russian so-called “society” yields so readily to high-sounding andcheap phrases that we have to lay particular emphasis onthis real result of the action of all parties, with their crit-icism of political questions of principle. 
 “The parties disappeared,” wrote the nationalist Novoye Vremya (No. 
 13199). 
 “Deputy Maklakov’s excellent speech (at the December7 sitting) united the entire Duma, which applauded him, forgetful of all party calculations and differences of opinion. 
” This comment by a nationalist paper, the chief organ of all toadyism, of persecution of Jews and non-Russiansin general, should be remembered and pondered by all who take a serious interest in politics. 
 It was not because they were “forgetful” of party dif-ferences of opinion that the Octobrists and nationalists,the Guchkovites and the Novoye Vremya people applauded Maklakov, but because they appreciated the profound unity of opinion of the liberal bourgeoisie and the nationalist landlords. 
 Maklakov revealed that unity of opinion on the funda-mental issues of home and foreign policy. 
 “While Russiadoes not seek war, neither does she dread it,” exclaimedthis Cadet, to prolonged applause by the nationalists . 
 How could they help applauding? Any politically literate person realises that these words expressed the Cadets’ acceptance of the policy of resorting to the threat of war, the policy of militarism, of armaments by land and by sea that oppress and ruin the mass of the people. 
 The liberals, who support militarism, are not feared by the reactionaries, who very correctly argue that supportfor militarism is action , whereas liberal exclamations are mere words which simply cannot be made a reality so long as the reactionaries are in power. 
 “Give us millions to spendon armaments, and we will clap and applaud your liberal talk”—this is what every clever semi-feudal landlord says, and should say, to the Duma Balalaikins. 
 170 And what about Maklakov’s stand on home policy? Is it accidental that the Right-wing priests are highly satisfied,as Rech itself testifies, or that Novoye Vremya gleefully reprints Maklakov’s “keynote”: “Let there be no division of Russia into two camps—the country and the govern-ment”? No, it is not accidental, because by his whining about the desirability of “reconciliation” Maklakov in fact echoes Kokovtsov. 
 For Kokovtsov, too, desires “reconciliation”! Kokovtsov desires no change in the balance of the social forces. 
 Maklakov did not show the slightest understanding of the kind of change that is necessary or how it can be brought about. 
 “Reconciliation” is precisely the term whichobscures the only serious question, that of the conditions and means of achieving this change—obscures it with rottenphrases that say nothing, that blunt the civic consciousness of the masses and lull them. 
 A “society” which is capable of applauding the speeches of a Maklakov about “reconciliation ” deserves nothing but contempt. 
 As for the speech of Malinovsky, the workers’ represent-ative, on the Ministerial declaration, both the nationalists and the Cadets took pains not to notice that in it the demo-crats were posing questions. 
 But then Malinovsky’s speech was not intended for their like at all. 
 Pravda No. 
 194, December 15, 1912 Published according to the Pravda text THE NATIONAL -LIBERALS Recent years have seen a definite differentiation taking place among the Russian liberals. 
 The “genuine” bour-geoisie has been setting itself apart from the general liberalcamp. 
 Liberal capital is forming its own special party, which is to incorporate (and is incorporating) many bourgeois elements which in the past made common cause with theOctobrists and which, on the other hand, is being joinedby the most moderate, big-bourgeois, “respectable” ele-ments of the Cadet Party. 
 The “Progressist” group in the Third and Fourth Dumas, as well as the one in the Council of State are on the verge of becoming the official party representatives of this nation-al-liberal bourgeoisie in the parliamentary arena. 
 Indeed,the recent congress of the “Progressists” virtually out-lined the national-liberal programme which Russkaya Molva 171 is advocating. 
 What do the so-called “Progressists” want? Why do we call them national-liberals? They do not want full and undivided rule of the land-lords and the bureaucrats. 
 They seek—and they say soplainly—a moderate constitution with narrowly-restrictedrights based on a bicameral system and an anti-democratic suffrage. 
 They want a “strong authority” that would pursue the “patriotic” policy of conquering with sword and firenew markets for “national industry”. 
 They want the bureau-crats to heed them as much as they heed the Purishke-viches. 
 And then they would be willing to forget their “oldaccounts” with the reactionaries and work hand in glove with them to establish a “great” capitalist Russia. 
 What separates these people from the Octobrist Party is that the landlords constitute too strong an element in that party and that it is tractable to the point of impo-tence. 
 From the Cadet Party they are separated by their distaste for the Cadets’ demagogical flirting with the democrats. 
 The Cadets’ hypocritical talk about universalsuffrage and compulsory alienation of the land (even withcompensation) seems to these “respectable” constitution-alists quite unnecessary and impermissible. 
 The national-liberals go straight to the point: one must not be afraid of accusations of “pandering to the reactionary forces” but must fight openly against “appeals for seizingthe landed estates” and against “fomenting hatred of thepropertied classes”; as regards “military might”, thereshould be neither Right nor Left. 
 “We are back in our country.... 
 The Russian army is ... our own army.... 
 The Russian court of justice is not Shemyaka’s 172 but our own .... 
 R ussia’s world standing is not a vainglorious whim of the bureaucracy but our own strength and joy” (see the policy statements of Russkaya Molva ). 
 The national-liberals undoubtedly have a certain “fu-ture” in Russia. 
 They will be a party of the “genuine” capitalist bourgeoisie, such as we see in Germany. 
 The purely intellectual, liberal elements who have few “roots”will remain with the Cadets. 
 The national-liberals willgain such ideologists as Struve, Maklakov, Protopopov,Kovalevsky and others, who have long had one foot in thereactionary camp. 
 They will no doubt be joined also by the exceedingly moderate “Shipovite” Zemstvo-landlord ele-ments, who likewise favour a constitution with narrowly-restricted rights, a “constitution” for the rich. 
 (It is notfor nothing that Mr. 
 Struve has recently recalled Mr. 
 Shipovin such kind terms. 
) The “Progressists’” dreams of a “strong authority” pur-suing a liberal policy cannot, of course, materialise in the near future. 
 And so the Khvostovs and Purishkevichesare still sitting pretty. 
 It may be that the national liberalparty will not take final shape just yet and that their news-paper will cease to exist as Slovo ,173 a paper which on the whole had set itself the same aims, did three years ago. 
 (In the Duma, however, the “Progressists” have become relatively stronger than the Cadets. 
) In any case, the coming into the open of the national-liberal bourgeoisie indicates a considerable maturing of the class antagonisms in Russia. 
 The workers must counter the self-determination of the capitalist bourgeoisie by putting ten times greater energyinto their own organisation and their own self-determina-tion as a class.

 It is impermissible for little groups abroad, having no direct mandate from any Social-Democratic organisa-tion in Russia, and not operating by agreement with it,to act in the name of the Social-Democratic Party. 
 4. 
 The resolutions of the August conference on basic issues of the movement, above all on the fundamental issue ofrecognition—complete and sincere recognition—of the illegal Party, are, to put it as mildly as possible, “diplo-macy”, i. 
e. 
, evasion of a straightforward answer tothe question. 
 They are in effect liquidationist resolutions. 
 5. 
 The political behaviour of the liquidationist group in Nashe Zarya and Luch after the (August) conference revealed the absolutely anti-Party character of this group, which found expression (a) in advocacy of an open Party; (b) in scoffing at “underground” work in the legalpress; (c) in a struggle against revolutionary strikesand revolutionary mass struggle in general. 
 A resolute struggle must be waged against this group as anti-Party. 
 6. 
 The advocacy of unity in the legal press—evading and obscuring the essence of the matter, namely, the ques-tion of recognising the illegal Party in practice —is de-ception of the workers.

 The Central Committeesucceeded in securing the attendance of members of theillegal Party organisations of St. 
 Petersburg (five persons), the Moscow Region (two), the South (two), the Urals and the Caucasus. 
 Elections from the local organisations couldnot be held, and the meeting was therefore not constituteda conference. 
 Some of the members of the Central Committeewere unable to attend because of police measures. 
 Nearly all the participants in the meeting had been playing a prominent role in various legal workers’ socie-ties and in the use of so-called “legal opportunities”. 
 Thusthe composition of the meeting ensured an accurate pictureof the whole of Party work in all the principal areas ofRussia. 
 The meeting held eleven sittings, and drafted resolu-tions on the following items of the agenda: (1) The revo-lutionary upswing, the strikes and the tasks of the Party. 
(2) Building the illegal Party organisation. 
 (3) The DumaSocial-Democratic group. 
 (4) The Party press. 
 (5) The in-surance campaign. 
 (6) The attitude to liquidationism. 
 Theissue of unity. 
 (7) The non-Russian Social-Democratic organisations. 
 The resolutions were adopted unanimously, the only exception being the abstention of one comrade on twoclauses of the “insurance” resolution, and of another onparticulars of the resolution on the non-Russians. 
 Endorsed by the Central Committee, the resolutions of the meeting provide a summary of Party experience and a guiding line on all the major questions of Social-Democratic work in present-day Russia. 
 * * * Taking systematic stock of the experience of 1912 is a most important task of the Social-Democrats, for that yearsaw a great, a historic change in Russia’s working-classmovement. 
 The point is not merely that decline and disinte-gration are giving way to a revival. 
 The working class has gone over to a massive offensive against the capitalists and the tsarist monarchy. 
 The wave of economic and polit-ical strikes has surged so high that in this respect Russiais once more ahead of all the countries of the world, includ-ing the most developed of them. 
 This fact will not, of course, make any class-conscious worker forget how very far ahead of us are the proletarians of the free countries in regard to organisation and classeducation of the masses. 
 But this fact has proved thatRussia has entered a period of the growth of a new revolu-tion . 
 The working class is faced with the great task of bring-ing about the revolutionary awakening of all the demo-cratic masses and of educating them in the struggle, ofleading them to the powerful onslaught which must bringRussia freedom and a republic by destroying the Romanovmonarchy. 
 The fundamental task of the moment is to givethe utmost support to the open revolutionary struggle of the masses, to organise, extend, deepen and intensify it. 
 Anyone who has failed to realise this task, who does notwork in an illegal organisation, group or nucleus promotingthe cause of the revolution, is not a Social-Democrat. 
 * * * The revolutionary upswing of the proletariat in 1912 was the main cause of the universally recognised change inthe mood of the democrats.

 Our task is not to succumb to the disorder anddisintegration left over from the period of 1908-11, but to fight against them. 
 Our job is not to swim with the stream of chaotic and unprincipled legalism, but to use every legalpossibility for gradually grouping all live elements aroundthe illegal Party. 
 Our slogan is: no peace with those whomisuse legalism to sow scepticism and indifference to therevolutionary struggle of the masses or even to hamper it outright. 
 We cannot guarantee the realisation of our demands by reducing them, by curtailing our programme, or byadopting the tactics of attracting unenlightened peoplewith the deceptive promise of easy constitutional reformsunder Russian tsarism. 
 We can guarantee it only by educat-ing the masses in the spirit of consistent democracy and awareness of the falsity of constitutional illusions. 
 Theguarantee lies in the revolutionary organisation of theforemost class, the proletariat, and in the great revolu-tionary enthusiasm of the masses. 
 The period of rampant counter-revolution has left us a heritage of ideological disorder and disruption, organisa-tional disintegration in many centres of the working-classmovement, primitive methods and forced isolation fromthe Party on the part of some, and a scornful, or even mali-cious, attitude to the “underground” that preserves thebehests of the revolution and elaborates revolutionary tactics, on the part of others. 
 The liquidators’ break-away from the Social-Democratic Party, their virtual isolation,and in some cases departure from Social-Democratic principles and disintegration of the non-Russian Social-Democratic organisations have all accentuated the demand for unity to the utmost degree. 
 Unity of the Social-Democratic proletariat is a neces-sary condition for its victories.

Anyone who speaks of unity, pretending that this questioncan be decided, cleared up, or at least raised, within the bounds of legality, deceives himself and the workers. 
 What will solve the problem of unity is certainly not meaningless phrases about “unity” in the legal press, noragreements with various “straggling” little groups of in-tellectuals, nor yet the diplomacy of negotiations abroad,but solely unity in the localities, the actual fusion of all worker members of the R.

 February 1913 RESOLUTIONS THE REVOLUTIONARY UPSWING, THE STRIKES AND THE TASKS OF THE PARTY 1. 
 The outstanding fact in the history of the working-class movement and the Russian revolution in 1912 was the remarkable development of both the economic and thepolitical strike movement of the proletariat. 
 The numberof political strikers reached one million. 
 2. 
 The character of the strike movement of 1912 deserves special attention. 
 The workers in a number of cases put forward economic and political demands simultaneously; the period of economic strikes was succeeded by a period ofpolitical strikes and vice versa. 
 The struggle against thecapitalists for the gains of 1905 taken away by the counter-revolution, and the growing cost of living, aroused moreand more sections of the workers, confronting them with political issues in the sharpest form. 
 All these forms of combination and intertwining of the economic and polit-ical struggle are a condition for and an earnest of the mightof the movement, giving rise to revolutionary massstrikes. 
 3. 
 The beginning of outbursts of discontent and of re-volts in the Navy and the Army, which marked the year 1912, was undoubtedly linked with the revolutionary massstrikes of the workers, and indicated the growing fermentand indignation among large sections of the democrats,in particular among the peasantry, who supply the bulkof the troops. 
 4. 
 All these facts, combined with the general swing to the left in the country, which had its effect on the elec-tions to the Fourth Duma despite the most shameless rigging of them by the Black-Hundred tsarist government, showed beyond all doubt that Russia had once more entered a period of open revolutionary struggle by the masses. 
 The new revolution, the beginning of which we are experiencing,is an inevitable result of the bankruptcy of the June Thirdpolicy of tsarism. 
 This policy was unable to satisfy eventhe most compliant big bourgeoisie. 
 The mass of the peoplehas become still more enslaved, particularly in the case of the oppressed nationalities, and the peasantry has again been reduced to a state where millions upon millions arestarving. 
 5. 
 Under these circumstances, revolutionary mass strikes are of exceptional importance also because they constituteone of the most effective means of overcoming the apathy, despair and disunity of the agricultural proletariat and the peasantry, rousing them to independent political activityand drawing them into the most concerted, simultaneousand extensive revolutionary actions. 
 6. 
 The Party organisations, in extending and intensify-ing their agitation for the immediate demands of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
—a democratic republic, an eight-hour working day, and confiscation of all the landed estates for thebenefit of the peasantry—must make it one of the primeobjects of their activity to give all-round support to revo-lutionary mass strikes, and to develop and organise allforms of revolutionary action by the masses. 
 In particular, an essential current task is to organise revolutionary street demonstrations both in combination with political strikesand as independent actions. 
 7. 
 The fact that some capitalists resort to lock-outs (mass dismissals) against the strikers confronts the work-ing class with new tasks. 
 It is necessary to take careful account of the economic conditions of strikes in every area, every industry and every particular case, find newforms of struggle (such as stay-in strikes) to counteract thelock-outs, and replace political strikes by revolutionarymeetings and revolutionary street demonstrations. 
 8. 
 Some legal press organs are carrying on general agi-tation against revolutionary mass strikes, irrespective of their appraisal of this or that strike. 
 Besides the liberalpress, such agitation is being carried on, for example, by the group of liquidators in the newspaper Luch , against the will of a substantial section of those workers who sup-port the newspaper in one form or another. 
 In view of this,the task of all pro-Party worker Social-Democrats is: (1) to wage a determined struggle against that group; (2) syste-matically and perseveringly to explain the harm of theabove-mentioned agitation to all workers, irrespective of their leanings, and (3) to rally all proletarian forces for the furtherance of revolutionary agitation and revolutionaryaction by the masses. 
 BUILDING THE ILLEGAL ORGANISATION 1. 
 In summing up the working-class movement and the Party’s work in 1912, this meeting finds that—the new wave of revolutionary actions by the masses that has begun has fully borne out the previous decisions of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
(particularly those of the January 1912 Conference) as regards building the Party. 
 The course of the strike move-ment in 1912, the Social-Democrats’ campaign in theelections to the Fourth Duma, the course of the insurance campaign, etc. 
, have shown beyond doubt that the only correct type of organisational structure in the presentperiod is an illegal party as the sum total of Party nuclei surrounded by a network of legal and semi-legal workers’ associations. 
 2. 
 It is absolutely obligatory to adapt the organisational forms of illegal building to local conditions. 
 A variety of forms of cover for illegal nuclei and the greatest possibleflexibility in adapting forms of work to local and general living conditions guarantee the vitality of the illegal or-ganisation. 
 3. 
 The chief immediate task in the field of organisational work at the present time is to establish in all factories purely Party illegal committees consisting of the mostactive elements among the workers. 
 The tremendous up-swing of the working-class movement creates conditions in which factory Party committees can be restored and theexisting ones strengthened in the vast majority of localities. 
 4. 
 The meeting points out that it has now become essen-tial in every centre to form a single leading organisation out of the disconnected local groups. 
In St. 
 Petersburg, for example, a leading City Committee, formed by combining the principle of election by district nuclei and the principle of co-option, has emerged as atype of city-wide organisation. 
 This type of organisation makes it possible to establish a very close and direct connection between the leading bodyand the primary nuclei, and at the same time to create a small, mobile, particularly well disguised executive body, authorised to act at any moment on behalf of the entireorganisation. 
 The meeting recommends this type for other centres of the working-class movement as well, with such modifications as may be prompted by local and generalliving conditions. 
 5. 
 With a view to establishing close links between local organisations and the Central Committee, as well as toguiding and unifying Party work, this meeting deems it imperative to organise regional centres in the principal areas of the working-class movement. 
 6. 
 A system of authorised nominees is proposed as a most important practical factor in establishing a permanent liv-ing link between the Central Committee and local Social-Democratic groups, as well as in devising flexible forms of directing local work in the major centres of the working-class movement. 
 Nominees should be recruited among work-ers in charge of local work. 
 Only advanced workers can by themselves strengthen and consolidate the cen-tral apparatus of the Party locally, and throughoutRussia. 
 7. 
 This meeting expresses the wish that the Central Com-mittee should confer as frequently as possible with localParty functionaries active in various fields of Social-Democratic work. 
 8. 
 This meeting stresses the repeated Party decisions to the effect that the workers’ party cannot exist unless there are regular membership dues and contributions by workers. 
 In the absence of such contributions, particularlyin present conditions, the existence of a central (local or all-Russia) Party body, however modest, will be absolute-ly impossible.

) THE SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC GROUP IN THE DUMA 1. 
 This meeting notes that despite unheard-of persecu-tion and the rigging of the elections by the government, and despite the Black-Hundred and liberal bloc against theSocial-Democrats that in many places assumed a very definite character, the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 won tremendous victo-ries in the elections to the Fourth Duma. 
 The Social-Democrats polled an increased number of votes almost every-where in the second urban curia, which they are wrest-ing more and more from the liberals. 
 In the worker curiawhich is the most important for our Party, the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 retained its undivided supremacy, the working class empha-sising with particular unanimity, by electing none butBolshevik deputies in the curia, its unshakable loyalty to the old R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 and its revolutionary behests. 
 2. 
 This meeting hails the vigorous activity of the Social-Democratic deputies to the Fourth Duma, which found expression in a number of speeches in the Duma, the sub-mission of interpellations and the reading of a declarationwhich in general correctly expressed the fundamental prin-ciples of Social-Democracy. 
 3. 
 This meeting recognises that our Party’s established tradition, by which the Duma Social-Democratic group is a body subordinate to the Party as a whole, in the shape of its central bodies, is the only correct one, and finds thatin the interests of the political education of the working class and the proper organisation of the Party’s work in the Duma, careful attention should be paid to every step ofthe Social-Democratic group, and in this way Party control exercised over the group. 
 4. 
 This meeting cannot but regard the resolution concern-ing Jagiello as a direct violation of Party duty by the Social-Democratic group. 
 That resolution backs the disrup-tive move of the Bund, which entered into an agreementwith a non-Social-Democratic party (the P. 
S. 
P. 
) against the Polish Social-Democrats and elected Jagiello, a non-Social-Democrat, in opposition to all the Social-Democratic electors, who were in the majority among the working-class electors. 
 The group thereby aggravated the split among the workers in Poland and hampered the cause of unity in the Party as a whole. 
 5. 
 Comrade Chkhenkeli’s defence, on behalf of the group, of cultural national autonomy under the guise of “estab-lishing the necessary institutions for the free develop-ment of each nationality” is a direct violation of the Party Programme. 
 175 The Second Congress of the Party, which adopted the Programme,176 rejected by a special vote what was in effect an identical formulation. 
 Concessions to na-tionalist sentiment, even in this disguised form, are imper-missible for a proletarian party. 
 6. 
 The Social-Democratic group’s vote in favour of the Progressist (in reality Octobrist) formula of procedure with regard to the declaration of the Minister, and the failureto introduce an independent Social-Democratic formula are a blunder which should be noted by the Party in view of the malicious comments of the liberal press. 
 177 7, 8 and 9. 
 (Not to be published. 
)178 ILLEGAL LITERATURE Having discussed the necessity for all-round development of illegal publishing and worked out a number of concreteinstructions on the matter, this meeting insistently calls upon all local organisations of the Party, all workers’ nuclei and individual workers to show greater independ-ence and initiative in the matter of transport and contacts with the Bureau of the Central Committee 179 for the dis-tribution of illegal literature. 
 THE INSURANCE CAMPAIGN Noting that the working class and its Party, despite all persecution, have displayed great energy in upholding proletarian interests in connection with the introductionof the insurance law, this meeting considers: 1. 
 It is necessary to wage the most determined and con-certed struggle against attempts by the government and the capitalists to make the workers elect their delegates to the sick benefit funds blindly, without allowing workers’meetings. 
 2. 
 Despite the prohibition, workers should everywhere try to hold spontaneous meetings for the preliminary nom-ination of the candidate delegates they want. 
 3. 
 Workers should organise revolutionary meetings to protest against the violence and outrages accompanyingthe introduction of the insurance laws. 
 4. 
 It is at all events necessary to draw up beforehand a workers’ list of candidate delegates from among the moreinfluential worker Social-Democrats and by concerted effort to champion the list also where no meetings can be held. 
 5. 
 This meeting considers it inadvisable and harmful to boycott the election of delegates. 
 At present the capi-talists are devoting their main efforts to preventing the work-ers from gaining ascendancy in certain proletarian factory nuclei, such as the workers’ sick benefit funds should become. 
 A boycott, which at the present time would disunite theworkers, would only assist the above-mentioned efforts ofthe capitalists. 
 6. 
 The struggle for the proper election of delegates to sick benefit funds must not cease for one moment. 
 While using every opportunity in every way and with the utmost energy, not for a moment allowing the employers to considerthe normal course of production assured, and extending anddeveloping the workers’ struggle, we must not refrain fromsecuring that the Social-Democratic list is adopted despiteall obstacles. 
 Elections do not preclude further develop-ment of the struggle. 
 On the contrary, by securing the election of staunch worker Social-Democrats as delegates,we shall facilitate the further struggle for proper elections,in which the delegates will give the utmost assistance tothe workers. 
 7. 
 Wherever elections take place without meetings, it is necessary to carry on agitation for the re-election of dele-gates through genuinely free elections, with the workersholding meetings by every means available. 
 8. 
 The Social-Democratic Duma group must immediately make a new interpellation on the banning of workers’ election meetings. 
 9. 
 All agitation on the introduction of insurance must be closely combined with a description of the entire stateof affairs in tsarist Russia, explaining our socialist prin-ciples and revolutionary demands. 
 THE ATTITUDE TO LIQUIDATIONISM, AND UNITY 1. 
 The Party’s four years of struggle against liquida-tionism have proved the absolute correctness of the defini-tion given by the December 1908 Party Conference of theR. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
, which said: “Attempts by a certain section of intellectuals in the Party to abolish the existing organisation of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
and replace it by an amorphous association within theframework of legality at all costs, even at the price of a down-right repudiation of the programme, tactics and traditionsof the Party. 
” Consequently, the liquidators are condemned not for stressing the necessity of legal work, but for renouncingand destroying the illegal Party. 
 The founding of the first Marxist workers’ daily news-paper in Russia and the election of none but Bolshevikdeputies in the worker curia proved beyond all doubt that the Party was able to cope with legal activity, having pushed aside the liquidators. 
 2. 
 By withdrawing from the illegal Party and grouping themselves separately from the local organisations, theliquidators brought about a split, which they confirmedby setting up so-called initiating groups in a number of localities, above all in St. 
 Petersburg. 
 The January 1912 Conference of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
, which decided that theliquidationist group of contributors to Nasha Zarya and Dyelo Zhizni —a group forming the core of the initiating groups—had “definitely placed itself outside the Party ”, * thereby merely registered the split effected by the liqui-dators. 
 *See present edition, Vol. 
 17, p. 
 481. 
— Ed. 
 3. 
 The August 1912 conference, which named itself a “conference of organisations of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
”, proved in fact to be a liquidationist conference, since its principal and leading section was the literary group of liquidatorswhich had broken away from the Party and was cut offfrom the mass of the Russian workers. 
 4. 
 The devotion of the overwhelming majority of the foremost workers to the illegal Party compelled the August conference to make seeming concessions to Party prin-ciple and profess recognition of the illegal Party. 
 In reality,however, all the resolutions of that conference are permeatedthrough and through with liquidationism, and immediate-ly after the conference Nasha Zarya and Luch , which announced its adherence to the August decisions, intensified their liquidationist propaganda— (a) for an open party; (b) against the underground; (c) against the Party Programme (defence of cultural national autonomy, revision of the agrarian laws enacted bythe Third Duma, shelving the slogan of a republic, and so on); (d) against revolutionary mass strikes; (e) for reformist, exclusively legalist tactics. 
 Hence one of the Party’s tasks is still to wage a deter-mined struggle against the liquidationist group of Nasha Zarya and Luch , and to make clear to the mass of the work-ers the great harm of the liquidators’ propaganda. 
 5. 
 The “unity” campaign launched by the liquidators in the legal press evades and obscures the main issue, thatof joining the illegal Party and working in it; thus it mis-leads the workers, for this issue cannot even be raised inthe legal press. 
 In reality the liquidators still behave assplitters, which became only too obvious during the elec-tions in St. 
 Petersburg, for when the electors were divided into two equal groups, it was the liquidators who rejectedthe proposal for drawing lots, the only means of doingaway with the disunity of the workers in the face of thebourgeois parties. 
 6. 
 Provided the illegal organisation of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 is recognised and joined, the unity of worker Social-Demo-crats of all trends and shades is an absolute necessitydictated by all the interests of the working-class movement. 
 Unification on these very principles has already been effected in the Narva district organisation of St. 
 Peters-burg and in a number of provincial organisations. 
 7. 
 This meeting most emphatically supports such uni-fication and recommends that the same thing should imme-diately be begun everywhere from below, in factory com-mittees, district groups, etc. 
, the worker comrades verify-ing whether the recognition of the illegal organisation and readiness to back the revolutionary struggle of the masses and revolutionary tactics are really put into effect. 
 Onlyto the extent that this unity from below is actuallyestablished will the final unification of the Party and com-plete consolidation of unity on an all-Russia scale be accom-plished. 
 NON-RUSSIAN SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC ORGANISATIONS 1. 
 The experience of 1912 fully confirmed the correct-ness of the decision which the January (1912) Conferenceof the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 adopted on this question. 
 * The Bund’s support of the nomination of Jagiello, a non-Social-Demo-crat, against the Polish Social-Democrats, and the viola-tion of the Party Programme in favour of nationalism bythe August (1912) conference of the liquidators, the Bundand the Lettish Social-Democrats revealed with particularclarity the complete bankruptcy of the federalist principles of organising the Social-Democratic Party and the great harm which the isolation of the non-Russian Social-Demo-cratic organisations does to the proletarian cause. 
 2. 
 This meeting therefore calls earnestly on the workers of all the nationalities of Russia to rebuff the militantnationalism of the reactionaries with the utmost deter-mination, to combat all manifestations of a nationalist spirit among the working masses. 
 It calls on the workerSocial-Democrats locally to display the closest solidarity,and to merge into integral organisations of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
working in all the languages spoken by the local prole-tariat and achieving real unity from below, as has long been done in the Caucasus. 
 *See present edition, Vol. 
 17, pp. 
 464-65. 
— Ed. 
 /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR 3. 
 This meeting expresses deep regret at the split in the ranks of the Polish Social-Democrats, which greatly weak-ens the struggle of the worker Social-Democrats of Po-land. 
 The meeting is compelled to state that the Exec-utive of the Polish Social-Democrats, which today does notrepresent the majority of the Social-Democratic organi-sations of the Polish proletariat, resorts to impermissiblemethods in combating that majority (for example, ground-lessly suspecting the entire Warsaw organisation of provo-cation). 
 The meeting calls on all the Party organisationswhich come in contact with the Polish worker Social-Demo-crats to help them in establishing genuine unity amongthe Polish Social-Democrats. 
 4. 
 This meeting points out in particular the extreme opportunism and liquidationism of the decisions adopted by the latest (ninth) conference of the Bund, which with-drew the slogan of a republic, pushed illegal work into thebackground and was oblivious of the revolutionary tasksof the proletariat. 
 Equally reprehensible is the Bund’sresistance to the unification of all worker Social-Democrats in the localities (Warsaw, Lodz, Vilna and elsewhere), a unification which the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 has repeatedly urged atits congresses and conferences since 1906. 
 5. 
 This meeting greets the revolutionary worker Social-Democrats of the Lettish organisation, who perseveringlycarry on anti-liquidationist propaganda, and expresses regret that the Central Committee of the Lettish Social-Democrats is inclined to support the anti-Party moves of theliquidators. 
 6. 
 This meeting expresses firm confidence that the revo-lutionary upswing which has begun, and the mass economicand political strikes, street demonstrations and other forms of open revolutionary struggle by the masses will help in completely unifying and merging the worker Social-Demo-crats in the localities without any distinction between thenationalities, thereby strengthening the onslaught againsttsarism, which oppresses all the peoples of Russia, andagainst the bourgeoisie of all the nations of Russia, which is in the process of uniting. 
 THE BRITISH LABOUR MOVEMENT IN 1912 The miners’ strike was the outstanding event of the past year. 
 While the railway strike in 1911 showed the“new spirit” of the British workers, the miners’ strike definitely marked an epoch. 
 Despite the “war” preparations of the ruling classes, and despite the strenuous efforts of the bourgeoisie to crushthe resistance of the rebellious slaves of capital, the strikewas a success. 
 The miners displayed exemplary organisa-tion. 
 There was not a trace of blacklegging. 
 Coal-mining by soldiers or inexperienced labourers was out of the ques-tion. 
 And after six weeks of struggle the bourgeois govern-ment of Britain saw that the country’s entire industrialactivity was coming to a standstill and that the words ofthe workers’ song, “All wheels cease to whir when thy handwills it”, 180 were coming true. 
 The government made concessions. 
 “The Prime Minister of the most powerful empire the world has ever seen attended a delegate meeting of themine-owners’ striking slaves and pleaded with them to agreeto a compromise. 
” That is how a well-informed Marxistsummed up the struggle. 
 The British Government, which year after year usually feeds its workers with promises of reform “some day”, thistime acted with real dispatch. 
 In five days a new law was rushed through Parliament! This law introduced a minimum wage, i. 
e. 
, regulations establishing rates of pay below which wages cannot be reduced. 
 It is true that this law, like all bourgeois reforms, is a miserable half-measure and in part a mere deception ofthe workers, because while fixing the lowest rate of pay, the employers keep their wage-slaves down all the same. 
 Nevertheless, those who are familiar with the British labour movement say that since the miners’ strike the British pro-letariat is no longer the same . 
 The workers have learned to fight. 
 They have come to see the path that will lead them to victory. 
 They have become aware of their strength. 
 Theyhave ceased to be the meek lambs they seemed to be for solong a time to the joy of all the defenders and extollers of wage-slavery. 
 In Britain a change has taken place in the balance of social forces, a change that cannot be expressed in figuresbut is felt by all. 
 Unfortunately, there is not much progress in Party affairs in Britain. 
 The split between the British Socialist Party (formerly the Social-Democratic Federation) and the In-dependent (of socialism) Labour Party persists. 
 The oppor-tunist conduct of the M. 
P. 
s belonging to the latter partyis giving rise, as always happens, to syndicalist tendencies among the workers. 
 Fortunately, these tendencies are notstrong. 
 The British trade unions are slowly but surely turning towards socialism, in spite of the many Labour M. 
P. 
s whostubbornly champion the old line of liberal labour policy. 
But it is beyond the power of these last of the Mohicansto retain the old line! Pravda No. 
 1, January 1, 1913 Published according Signed: W. 
 to the Pravda text BETTER LATE THAN NEVER I have had to be very late in coming out with a denial of what L. 
 Martov wrote in Luch (No. 
 37, October 28, 1912). 
 But how can it be helped? It is easy to tell an untruth,but sometimes it takes a long time to find out the truth. 
 In Luch No. 
 37, L. 
 Martov heaped upon me the choicest abuse seasoned with the sort of “obscure” innuendoes that are usual with that writer. 
 Having become accustomed inten years to these methods of struggle used by L. 
 Martov,I did not even read his article to the end. 
 But some col-leagues pointed out to me that L. 
 Martov alleges that ComradeHaase, a member of the Central Committee of the German Social-Democrats, has said: “Lenin is deceiving the Inter-national. 
” To get at the truth, I had to find the source of Martov’s allegation. 
 He referred to a certain Miners ’ Newspaper No. 
 225. 
 I could not find it. 
 Vorwärts (central organ of the German Social-Democratic Party) contains no such words. 
 I only found them in the Bremer Bürger-Zeitung 181 (the organ of the Bremen Social-Democrats). 
 I was faced with the necessity of questioning Haase himself if I did not want to imitate L. 
 Martov’s frivolousattitude. 
 I sent a written inquiry to the Central Committee of the German Social-Democrats. 
 Here is Haase’s reply: Central Committee of the German Social-Democratic Party Berlin, December 31, 1912 Dear Comrades, In reply to your inquiry, I wish to inform you that the wording which, according to you, Luch used in reporting my speech in the International Socialist Bureau, is not in accord with the facts. 
 The question discussed at the meeting was whether the Organising Com-mittee can claim representation on the International Socialist Bureau. 
I said this was impermissible because, even according to its ownstatement, the Organising Committee is not an organisation but merely wants to be a union of groups for restoring the unity of the organisation. 
 In this connection, I raised the question of who specifi-cally was entitled to represent the Russian party in its present state,and remarked that if it was true that in its relations with the Inter-national Bureau the Central Committee acted as the “R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
”,this name might give rise to misunderstandings. 
 Thus there was no attack on Lenin here, and in general, the re-mark was not an insulting one at all. 
 I wanted only to ascertain thestate of affairs in view of the above-mentioned assertion, andprimarily to raise the question whether the time had not come totake steps towards unifying all the Russo-Polish groups. 
 I was verysorry Lenin was absent. 
 For the sake of completeness only, I wish to point out that the word “deceit” never passed my lips. 
 With comradely greetings, Haase And so, in order to heap abuse on me for the thousandth time, L. 
 Martov has repeated (echoing someone else) an untruth about Haase. 
 Haase was against the Organising Committee being rep-resented, but he did not dispute the representation of the Central Committee. 
 Haase does not consider that the Central Committee represents the entire R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
, including the non-Russians and the liquidators; but then, as far as I know, the Central Committee itself has never claimed that it represented either of these. 
 The non-Russians (the Poles, the Bund, the Letts) have special representatives of their own. 
 I confine myself to this factual denial. 
 N. 
 Lenin Written on January 6 (19), 1913 Published in Pravda No. 
 8, Published according January 11, 1913 to the Pravda text THE DEVELOPMENT OF REVOLUTIONARY STRIKES AND STREET DEMONSTRATIONS It has long since been pointed out, and recognised by all, that the year 1912 was an outstanding landmark in thedevelopment of the strike movement. 
 But not all have realised and taken proper account of it. 
 Let us take the data on political strikes in the first elev-en months of the year. 
 The result is as follows: 1905 ......... 1,052,000 1906 ......... 642,000 1907 ......... 540,000 .... 
. 
 .... 
 1912 ...... about 900,000 The number of political strikers in the first nine months was 700,000, according to the most conservative estimates. 
Strikes in connection with clearing up the matter of the delegates in St. 
 Petersburg 182 involved up to 50,000 persons; the strike in protest against the Sevastopol executions andthe strike on November 15, the day when the Duma opened,involved 188,000 persons, according to the Moscow Manu-facturers ’ Society . 
 These data are for the period before November 20. 
 Obviously, 900,000 is a minimum figure. 
 Even subtracting 100,000 that are hardly comparable with 1905-07 (factories outside the province of the factory in-spectorate), we get 800,000. 
 In any case, the movement definitely surpassed that in 1906 and 1907, and fell but slightly short of that in 1905! What does this mean? The national scale of the movement at present is, of course, much smaller than in 1905. 
 Consequently, thebeginning of the revolutionary upswing is incomparably higher today than it was before the first revolution. 
 Con-sequently, the coming second revolution even now reveals a much greater store of revolutionary energy in the proletar-iat. 
 The proletariat has grown in numbers—by a minimumof 20 per cent. 
 Its concentration has increased. 
 The purelyproletarian mainstay of the movement has become strongerdue to accelerated dissociation from the land. 
 The sizeof the proletarian and semi-proletarian population in “domestic” industry, handicrafts and agriculture has grown to an enormous extent defying calculation. 
 Lastly, there has been an increase in the political con-sciousness, experience and determination of the foremostdemocratic class. 
 This is admitted by all, but not all canbring themselves to think out all the implications. 
 Not all can bring themselves to face the truth and admit that we are witnessing revolutionary mass strikes, the beginning of a revolutionary upsurge. 
 This is indicated first and foremost by the fundamental and most objective fact, one least of all permitting of sub-jective interpretation, namely, the scope of the movement. 
 In no country of the world would it be possible, unless there were a revolutionary social situation, to rouse hundreds ofthousands of workers to political action for the most variedreasons several times a year. 
 But in our country this riseis taking place spontaneously, because tens of millions ofthe semi-proletarian and peasant population are passing on, if one can use this expression, to their vanguard a senti-ment of concentrated indignation, which is surging up andoverflowing. 
 The Russian workers’ revolutionary strike in 1912 was national in the fullest sense of the term. 
 For what shouldbe understood by a national movement is not at all one with which—in the conditions of a bourgeois-democratic revolution—the whole bourgeoisie, or at least the liberalbourgeoisie, is in agreement. 
 Only opportunists hold thatview. 
 On the contrary, a national movement is one whichexpresses the objective needs of the whole country, and aimsits heaviest blows at the central forces of the enemy oppos-ing the country’s development. 
 A national movement is one which has the sympathy of the vast majority of thepopulation. 
 Such precisely is the workers’ political movement this year, a movement which has the sympathy of all working and exploited people, of all democrats, however weak, downtrodden, disunited and helpless they may be. 
 Themore definite demarcation between liberalism and democ-racy (achieved not without a struggle against those whoaspired to “wrest the Duma from the hands of the reaction-aries”) is a tremendous advantage of the new movement, If the revolution is to succeed, it must know as exactly as possible with whom it can go into battle, which of itsallies is unreliable and who is its real enemy. 
 That is why the direct actions of the liberals (Cadets) against the new revolution are so very significant. 
 Andthat is why the slogan of a republic, which clears the minds of all democrats willing to fight from the monarchist (as well as “constitutional”) illusions which sapped somuch the strength of the onslaught in 1905, is of the mostexceptional importance (by comparison with Europe)in Russia just now. 
 Of historic importance in the processof growth of the new revolution in Russia are two factors: firstly, the April and May strikes during which the St. 
 Petersburg workers—in spite of the arrest of their leadingorganisation, the St. 
 Petersburg Committee—put forwardthe slogan of a republic, an eight-hour working day, andconfiscation of the landed estates. 
 Secondly, the Novemberstrikes and demonstrations (see letters from Riga and Mos-cow 183, the same thing happened in St. 
 Petersburg, but the arrests swept away our correspondents). 
 The slogansof those demonstrations were not only “Down with the deathpenalty! Down with war!”, but also “Long live the revolu-tionary working class and the revolutionary army!” In the streets of St. 
 Petersburg, Riga and Moscow, the proletariat held out its hand to those foremost fighters of the muzhik armed forces who had risen heroically againstthe monarchy. 
 * * * The liberal bourgeoisie is against a new revolution, against revolutionary mass strikes. 
 But the liberals are byno means opposed to political strikes in general, that is, if these are only evidence of a “revival” and support merely the liberal slogan of constitutional reform. 
 And objectively irrespective of their “good” intentions, our liquidators are mere servants of the counter-revolutionary bourgeoisiethey marked both historic moments of the upswing by “pro-nouncements” against revolutionary strikes!! In Nevsky Golos No. 
 1, on May 20, 1912, the unforgettable and incom-parable V. 
 Yezhov rebelled against “complicating” econom-ic strikes by political strikes and vice versa, against their “harmful lumping together” (cf. 
 Sotsial-Demokrat No. 
 27, p. 
 4). 
 * In November 1912 the liquidationist Luch , too, was up in arms against strikes. 
 Afterwards it tried to put inatten-tive people “on a false scent” by referring to the fact that the Social-Democratic group, too, was against the Novem-ber 15 strike. 
 But anyone who looks at all into the meaningof the event will easily see through Luch ’s trickery. 
 Yes, both the Social-Democratic group and the St. 
 Peters-burg Committee found the November 15 strike inoppor-tune. 
 They sounded a warning against that particular strike on that particular day. 
 It was the duty of the working-class press to report this. 
 And Luch and Pravda did. 
 But Luch did something besides. 
 After the event of November 15 (when the most zealous in striking was the very same Vyborg District which untilthen had been most of all linked with the Mensheviks), and after the movement had grown to the dimensions of a de-monstration, the sagacious Luch carried articles (an editorial and, following the editorial of November 17, a feuilleton on November 21) crying out against the “dangerous fritteringaway of forces”, declaring that “if strikes are used frequent-ly, people will stop sympathising with them”, advancing the slogan “Let us seek a different path” and “Nothing is to be gained by outbreaks” (!?!), and howling against “play-ing at strikes ”. 
 That is the kind of “philosophy”, advocated by you liquidator gentlemen, and long familiar to the St. 
 Peters-burg workers, both from Nevsky Golos and from speeches by members of your “initiating group”, that has gained *See pp. 
 116-17 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 you the legitimate hatred and contempt of the St. 
 Peters-burg workers. 
 A particular strike may be unfortunate or take place at an unfortunate moment. 
 But only liberals and counter-revolutionaries are free to describe as “playingat strikes” one of the world’s greatest movements, whichbrought into action almost a million proletarians! Frequent strikes are apt to exhaust the workers. 
 It may well be, therefore, that we shall have to call for shorter strikes and for demonstrations that have been better pre-pared. 
 But the event of November 15 was remarkable pre-cisely as a new step forward in the demonstration move-ment! Instead of honestly admitting your mistake (for you were plainly mistaken as to the significance of November 15), you liquidators began to talk, like the most brazen liberals, about the “political illiteracy” of the revolutionaryappeal, you who are repeating the ABC of liberal politics! Let the workers judge the worth of the liquidators’ smooth-spoken talk about their “unity” with the Party when ithappens that at the time of the rise and development of revolutionary strikes and demonstrations, the liquidators launch a struggle against them, using the legal press torevile illegal appeals!! * * * However, there is a more profound reason for the liqui-dators’ campaign against strikes. 
 The liquidators are slavesof the liberals. 
 And the liberals have really begun to feelill at ease because of the stubborn character of revolution-ary strikes. 
 The “Progressist” factory owner has begun togrumble and even to rage. 
 The Milyukovs now fear lest their “bloc” with Rodzyanko should be disturbed. 
 Liquidationist policy serves to subject the workers to the liberals. 
 Marxist policy raises the workers to the roleof leaders of the peasantry . 
 One cannot speak of this legally, liquidator gentlemen, but one must think of it and tellabout it to those who want to be revolutionary Social-Democrats. 
 In free, constitutional Europe, political strikes for the time being (so long as the socialist revolution has not yet begun) serve the struggle for individual reforms. 
 In slave, Asiatic, tsarist Russia, which is drawing near her next bourgeois-democratic revolution, political strikes are the only serious means of stirring up the peasantry and thebetter part of the peasant army, of shaking them up androusing them to a revolutionary struggle! The time is past—fortunately for Russia—when there was no one to “go amongthe people” but heroic solitary Narodniks. 
 The time is passing when solitary terrorists could speak of “rousing” the people by terrorism. 
 Russia has left those sad timesbehind. 
 In 1905 the revolutionary proletariat found foritself a different way “to go among the people”, and a dif-ferent means of drawing the masses into the movement That means is revolutionary strikes, stubborn strikes shifting from place to place, from one part of the country to another, recurrent strikes, strikes which rouse the back-ward to a new life of struggle for economic improvements,strikes which brand and lash every salient act of violenceor tyranny, every crime of tsarism, strike-demonstrationswhich unfurl the red banner in the streets of the capital cities and bring revolutionary speeches and revolutionary slogans to the crowd , to the mass of the people. 
 Such strikes cannot be called forth artificially, but nei-ther can they be stopped once they have begun to involvehundreds and hundreds of thousands. 
 Let the liberal, who is moved by being given a seat be-side Rodzyanko “himself”, tell the workers: “Brothers, no more outbreaks, seek a different path, take up the peace-ful trade union movement, prepare yourselves earnestly foran open European party, don’t incite the muzhik to rebel-lion, don’t waste your energy on strikes or ‘we’ shall stopsympathising with you!” The workers will know how to assess such talk, and will see through it even in the garb of the “near-Marxist” expres-sions of any of the Luch writers. 
 The workers will concentrate on deliberately supporting, strengthening, developing and consolidating the sponta-neously growing revolutionary strike to prepare the peas-ants and the armed forces for a rising. 
 If strikes exhaust the workers, they should be carried out intermittently,enabling some of the forces to rest while the forces that are rested or “fresh” are roused to take up the struggle. 
 Shorter strikes should be called. 
 Occasionally strikes should be replaced by demonstrations. 
 But the important thing is that strikes, meetings and demonstrations should takeplace continuously, that the whole peasantry and the armedforces should know of the workers’ stubborn fight, and thatthe countryside—even the most out-of-the-way corners ofit—should see that there is unrest in the towns, that “ their ” people have risen in revolt, that they are waging a life-and-death struggle, that they are fighting for a better life,for higher pay, for an end to the outrages and tyranny ofthe authorities, for the transfer of the landed estates to thepeasants, for the overthrow of the tsar’s landlord monarchy,for a republic. 
 It is essential that the smouldering resent-ment and subdued murmurings of the countryside should, along with the indignation in the barracks, find a centreof attraction in the workers’ revolutionary strikes. 
 Wemust work on this indefatigably, and we shall live to seethe day when the proletariat, jointly with the peasantryand the armed forces, brings down the landlords and over-throws the tsarist monarchy by a people’s uprising.

 Written in January 1913 Published for the first time Published according to the manuscript THE SPLIT AMONG THE POLISH SOCIAL-DEMOCRATS The present split among the Polish Social-Democrats is the fruit of a conflict that began several years ago. 
 Atthe Sixth Congress of the Party, in 1908, such a sharp antagonism was shown between the Executive Committee, on the one hand, and the Warsaw and Dombrowa areaorganisations, on the other, that the Congress rejected amotion of confidence in the Executive. 
 The conflict wasorganisational but had great political significance. 
 The twolocal organisations insisted on the opportunity to influence the political position of the Party, and claimed widespread discussion of all its steps by the organisations. 
 The Executive has remained, nevertheless, in the hands of the same people. 
 And its majority, headed by the notori-ous Tyszka, sticks to its tactics, profiting by the weakeningof the Party, by failures and by the conditions of counter-revolution. 
 In the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
, Tyszka played the master and plotted in the name of the Social-Democracy of Polandand Lithuania, without paying the slightest attention tothe will of the latter. 
 In the policy of the Party, an era ofunprincipledness and vacillation began, on such questions,for example, as the trade unions, the attitude to the P. 
S. 
P. 
, and the tactics of the Polish Social-Democrats within the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 Comrades who laid bare the contradictions inthe policy of the Executive and demanded a consistentlyprincipled line had their mouths shut by the Executive,which would not allow any discussion in the press and,worse still, constantly promised to open a discussion “in the near future”, when it would also publish the comrades’ protests against its tactics. 
 Tyszka’s opponents on the Exec-utive itself, who were all old functionaries, well known to the whole Party, were ousted one by one. 
 One of them refused to stand for re-election at the Sixth Congress, saying that it was impossible to work with Tyszka, another was ousted in 1909, and a third refused to enter the Executivein 1911. 
 But as the movement grew and became more active, from early 1911 onwards, discontent began to show in localorganisations as well. 
 The “rebellion” was led by the War-saw organisation, which is the most important and powerful, and above all the most consistent in the revolutionarysense, and which, ever since 1905, has been in the Leftwing among the Polish Social-Democrats. 
 The Executive, of course, became uneasy and made ready to “nip it in the bud”. 
 The December 1911 inter-district conference in Warsaw served as the signal for the attack. 
 That conference made bold to insist that the “terri-tory” should be represented more strongly at the nextParty conference, i. 
e. 
—the impious idea!—that the influ-ence of the Executive at the conference should thereby beweakened. 
 But that would have been half the trouble, for a similar resolution was adopted by the Lodz conference as well. 
 Warsaw did something more criminal: it showedthat it demanded this not haphazardly, but with a political aim in view. 
 It adopted several political resolutions that Tyszka did not like; among other things, it expressed dis-pleasure at the fact that the Executive had submitted no report to Warsaw on its activity, and demanded that the Executive should acquaint the Party with its activityinside the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
, that it should not make a “Russian”policy secretly from the Polish workers, and so on. 
 An open struggle began. 
 Tyszka gave vent to a series of “circulars” and “explanations”. 
 He “explained” that (1) the Warsaw organisation had trampled the Party Rules underfoot and resorted to a split; (2) that its resolutionswere an indication of boycottism, otzovism and anarchism;(3) that it had no ideological differences with the Exec-utive and hence the split had no political basis; (4) thatthe Warsaw organisation did not exist, the conference had been fictitious, and consequently there was and had been no split; (5) that the Warsaw organisation had been un-able to publish a single sheet on its own and had left all literary work to the Executive; that it had unlawfully de-vised a disruptive technique of its own and was publishing its own sheets. 
 He also gave a personal description, complete with family details, of a couple of Warsaw “intellectualistwarchols ”, * and explained that they had brought about a split but did not work in the organisation and neverhad. 
 Finally, seeing that the Warsaw organisation held its ground, Tyszka made up his mind to take “heroic” measures. 
 He decided to call a fictitious conference and not to allow it to be attended by the opposition, i. 
e. 
, the vast majorityof the comrades active in the territory. 
 To that end heannounced the “dissolution” of the strongest organisation—Warsaw—and formed a separate “Warsaw organisation” of splitters out of two or three agents of his own. 
 But the most outrageous thing is the “grounds” on which Tyszka “dissolved” the Warsaw organisation. 
 He announcedthat the organisation, which refused to submit to him, wasnothing but a tool of police provocation. 
 So far he has notcited a single serious fact, even of the very smallest kind, to support his allegation. 
 Nor has he published the name of a single person he suspects. 
 What is more, to leave the way to retreat open, he wrote like a coward, in a statement tothe International Bureau, that provocation could veryeasily have ensconced itself in Warsaw as in any other organisation functioning under the present conditions. 
 Nevertheless, Tyszka saw fit to “dissolve” the Warsaw organisation, and even to declare it to be outside theR. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 The reader will see that this is no longer afactional struggle but in fact something of a criminalnature. 
 Needless to say this reckless step by Tyszka’s caused indignation ten times as great. 
 The committee which he himself had appointed to inquire into the provocationcame out against him. 
 Tyszka replied by expelling from theParty three leaders of the Polish Social-Democracy whohad been members of the Party for many years and whoenjoyed universal confidence. 
 Forty-four veteran func-tionaries published a most emphatic protest against the *Trouble-makers. 
— Ed. 
 Executive’s actions, which are humiliating to any revolu-tionary. 
 Both in the territory and abroad, people insist that the “Executive” should be called to account. 
 It goes without saying that the Warsaw organisation did not dis-solve itself to please Tyszka but continues its work, which isso difficult under present conditions. 
 It was the “opposi-tion” that achieved signal success in the elections for theworker curia of Warsaw. 
 The elections gave the Social-Democrats an absolute majority over all the other parties. 
 Of the 34 Social-Democratic delegates, 31 support the op-position, 2 are vacillating, and only one backs Tyszka. 
On the other hand, in the provinces, where the “work” iscarried on by the Executive and its supporters, the elec-tion campaign was lost everywhere . 
 It is to be hoped that the petty and unseemly squabble caused by Tyszka’s conduct will soon be a thing of the pastand that differences of principle will stand out more clearly. 
The Polish worker Social-Democrats’ desire to establishcloser organisational links with their Russian comradeswill also find a more specific expression. 
 Tyszka’s conduct in the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 has resulted in the Executive becoming completely divorced from the life of the Party as a wholeand having not a single ally in the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
, and bothsides (the liquidators and anti-liquidators) alike are shrug-ging their shoulders over the strange and unprincipled“tactics” of Tyszka and his “Executive”. 
 The Polish Social-Democrats are passing through hard times. 
 But already there are signs of a way out. 
 All thesound elements of the Polish Social-Democratic movementare rallying together. 
 And the time is already near when thePolish Social-Democracy will be an organisation of pro-Party worker Social-Democrats who have principles and tactics of their own and are not a plaything in the hands of an unscrupulous plotter. 
 We think it necessary to complete the report on the split among the Polish Social-Democrats with certain data on the subsequent history of the accusation of “provocation”. 
Here is what we have been told: Rosa Luxemburg (member of the International Socialist Bureau from the Polish Social-Democracy) wrote a note to the I. 
S. 
B. 
 alleging that the Warsaw Committee was made up of splitters and was in the hands of the secret police , stating that this was not to be published! Yet Tyszka himself published this abomination in the Polish Social-Democratic press!! Lenin, upon receiving a copy of Tyszka’s note from Huys-mans, Secretary of the International Socialist Bureau, sent a letter to Huysmans, of course, saying that it was a“most perfidious” act of vengeance, that Malecki and Ha-necki, ex-members of the Central Committee, were knownto all in the Party; that the committee of inquiry appointedby Tyszka himself had discovered no provocation; that to publish anything about provocation among political op-ponents, without giving names, was a most foul and meanthing to do. 
 * The Executive replied with mere abuse. 
The Basle Congress met. 
 The delegation of the Warsaw Committee was unanimously recognised by all R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 delegates—liquidators, Letts, Vperyodists, Bundists and Trotskyists alike! The Warsaw election resulted in both electors being worker Social-Democrats who supported the Warsaw Com-mittee and were opposed to Tyszka and Co. 
 The fictitious nature of Tyszka’s parallel organisation has been demonstrated to all. 
 The honest course—of with-drawing the accusation of provocation—is more than Tyszkaand his Executive can adopt. 
 But best of all are our liquidators and their Organising Committee, who love “unity”. 
 Luch , which officially adheres to the August conference, has twice printed Tyszka’s foul lie!! On the first occasion it was done by a gentleman who hid behind initials. 
 The second time it was done by Mr. 
Avgustovsky .

 30, Published according January 12 (25), 1913 to the text in Sotsial-Demokrat ON BOLSHEVIS M187 The origin of Bolshevism is inseparably linked with the struggle of what is known as Economism (opportunism which rejected the political struggle of the working classand denied the latter’s leading role) against revolutionarySocial-Democracy in 1897-1902. 
 Economism, supported by the Bund, was defeated and eliminated by the well-known campaign of the old Iskra 188 (Munich, London and Geneva, 1900-03), which restored the Social-DemocraticParty (founded in 1898 but later destroyed by arrests) onthe basis of Marxism and revolutionary Social-Democraticprinciples. 
 At the Second Congress of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 (August 1903), the Iskrists split: the majority stood for the principles and tactics of the old Iskra , while the minority turned to opportunism, and was backed by the one-time enemies of Iskra , the Economists and the Bundists. 
 Hence the terms Bolshevism * and Menshevism * (Bolsheviks and Mensheviks). 
 In 1903-04 the struggle was mainly over the Mensheviks’ opportunism in questions of organisation. 
 From the end of 1904 on, tactical differences became themost important. 
 The “plan for the Zemstvo campaign” 189 put forward (autumn 1904) by the new Iskra , which had deserted to the Mensheviks, took up the defence of thetactics of “not intimidating the liberals”. 
 The year 1905 saw the tactical differences take final shape (the Bolshevik Congress, Third Congress of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 in London,May 1905, and the Menshevik “conference” held in Genevaat the same time). 
 The Mensheviks strove to adapt working-class tactics to liberalism. 
 The Bolsheviks, however, putforward as the aim of the working class in the bourgeois-democratic revolution: to carry it through to the end and *From the Russian words for majority and minority . 
—Tr. 
 to lead the democratic peasantry despite the treachery of the liberals. 
 The main practical divergencies between the two trends in the autumn of 1905 were over the fact that the Bolsheviks stood for boycotting the Bulygin Dumawhile the Mensheviks favoured participation. 
 In the springof 1906, the same thing happened with regard to the WitteDuma. 
 First Duma: the Mensheviks stood for the slogan ofa Duma (Cadet) Ministry; the Bolsheviks, for the slogan of a Left (Social-Democratic and Trudovik) Executive Com-mittee that would organise the actual struggle of themasses, etc. 
 This could be set forth in greater detail only inthe press abroad. 
 At the Stockholm Congress (1906) the Men-sheviks won the upper hand, and at the London Congress(1907), the Bolsheviks. 
 In 1908-09 the Vperyod group (Mach-ism 190 in philosophy and otzovism, or boycotting the Third Duma, in politics—Bogdanov, Alexinsky, Lunacharsky andothers) broke away from the Bolsheviks. 
 In 1909-11, infighting against them (cf. 
 V. 
 Ilyin, Materialism and Empirio-Criticism , Moscow, 1909 *), as well as against the liquidators (Mensheviks who denied the need for an illegal Party), Bolshevism came close to the pro-Party Menshe-viks (Plekhanov and others), who had declared a resolute war on liquidationism. 
 The Bolshevik organs were:Vperyod and Proletary (Geneva, 1905), Novaya Zhizn (St. 
 Petersburg, 1905), Volna , Ekho , etc. 
 (St. 
 Petersburg, 1906), Proletary in Finland (1906-07), Geneva (1908) and Paris (1909), Sotsial-Demokrat in Paris (1909-12). 
 Some of the principal writings of Bolshevism are collected in V.

 THE SIGNIFICANCE OF POINCARÉ ’S ELECTION The new President of the French Republic is being effu-sively congratulated. 
 Take a look at the Black-Hundred-pogromist Novoye Vremya and the liberal Rech : how touchingly unanimous they are in congratulating President Poincaré and expressing their delight! The appraisal of foreign policy issues and of the state of affairs in the Western countries is particularly indica-tive of the profound inner kinship of our Black Hundredsand our liberals. 
 The fact that both of them hail the “na-tional” President, Poincaré, who has been elected by an alliance of the big bourgeoisie and clerical and feudal reac-tion in France, makes it clear to anyone that the BlackHundreds and liberals disagree only over methods of combat-ing socialism. 
 But Poincaré’s election is of greater interest than the zealous “congratulators” think. 
 Class-conscious workers in pondering on the significance of this election, note threecircumstances. 
 Firstly, Poincaré’s election means another step forward in aggravating the class struggle confronting France. 
Poincaré was Premier in a Chamber having a Radical majority. 
 But he has been elected President against the Radical candidate, Pams, with the aid of clerical and feudal reaction, and by the Right bloc . 
 What does that mean? Power in France is in the hands of the last bourgeois party, the Radicals. 
 192 It is becoming less and less distinguishable from “reaction”. 
 The whole bourgeoisie—from radical to reactionary—is uniting ever more closely against the socialist proletariat, and the boundarybetween the two sections of the bourgeoisie is becoming more and more obliterated. 
 This was revealed all the more vividly by the election of Poincaré. 
 This sort of unity is an unmistakable sign of the extreme aggravation of class antagonisms. 
 Secondly, Poincaré’s career is worthy of note, being that of a typical bourgeois businessman who sells himself inturn to all parties in politics, and to all rich men “outside”politics. 
 Poincaré has been a lawyer by profession since the age of twenty. 
 At twenty-six he was a chef de cabinet and at thirty-three, a Minister. 
 Rich men and the big-wigsof finance in all countries think highly of the politicalconnections of such dexterous careerists. 
 A “brilliant”lawyer-deputy and a political trickster are synonyms i n the “civilised” countries. 
 Worthy of note, thirdly, is the demonstration made by the French Socialists during Poincaré’s election. 
 The votein favour of Vaillant was a demonstration in honour of theCommune. 
 Vaillant is a living memory of it. 
 One has onlyto see the welcome which Parisian workers give the white-haired Vaillant when he appears on the platform to realise this. 
 And now, in the very same Versailles where bourgeois France in 1871 sold its country to Bismarck in order tocrush the revolt of the proletariat, and in the very samehall where forty-two years ago was heard the beastly howl-ing of the reactionary landlords of France who were long-ing for a king, the working-class deputies voted for a vet-eran Communard.

 to the Pravda text FRANKLY This newspaper has already noted the failure, in the Council of State, of the Duma Bill to introduce a Zemstvoin Archangel Gubernia. 
 But it is well worth dwelling once more on the importance of this fact, which, for all its in-significance, is highly characteristic. 
 For almost half a century there has existed a Zemstvo of the nobility, one which guarantees the absolute prepon-derance of the feudal type of landlord . 
 And only in some gubernias, such as Vyatka Gubernia, where there is hardly any landed nobility, the Zemstvo has more of a muzhik character. 
 However, there it is enmeshed even more in allkinds of bureaucratic bans, impediments, restrictions andspecifications. 
 It would seem that it is this sort of harmless,curtailed Zemstvo that Archangel Gubernia, too, has beenseeking for over a half century. 
 And now the resolution of the Black-Hundred, landlord and bourgeois Third Duma to introduce a Zemstvo in Ar-changel Gubernia has been rejected by the Council of State. 
 What a glaring light this “trifle” sheds on the essence o f our “renovated” system! What a splendid lesson on theclass roots of politics! The arguments of the opponents of the Zemstvo on the Council of State are frank—there is no nobility there, yousee. 
 “Private” landownership in the whole gubernia amountsto a mere 2,660 dessiatines, exclaimed Mr. 
 Stishinsky,the reporter in the Council of State. 
 It follows that where there is no landed nobility, the “people” are not mature enough even to deal with the repair of roads and the building of hospitals. 
 But if there are nolandlords, they should be implanted, directly or indirectly. 
 Implanted from where? From central Russia, where they are numerous enough. 
 The landlords of the black-earth central region where the vestiges of serfdom are freshest, where more is left of the corvée (labour service) system thananywhere else, and where diehards like those in KurskGubernia rule and reign and govern—those are the ones torely on where government and public affairs are concerned. 
In this sense, the attitude of the Council of State to the question of a Zemstvo in Archangel Gubernia is a most instructive and graphic lesson in our statehood.

 to the Pravda text THE BRIAND CABINET The well-known renegade Briand, once an extreme revo-lutionary and an advocate of the “general strike”, finds himself again at the head of the French Ministry. 
 Like John Burns in Britain, he has betrayed the working class andsold himself to the bourgeoisie. 
 The composition of his new Cabinet is of interest. 
 It is dominated by the trio of Jonnart, Etienne and Baudin. 
What sort of men are they? Take a look at the liberal papers, such as Rech No. 
 11. 
 You will find there a most detailed account of where theMinisters were educated and where they were employed. 
You will find shameless advertising and the desire to curryfavour: Jonnart is said to be a friend of King Edward, andBaudin, the nephew of a Communard! “Zhomini this, Zhomini that—and not a word about vod-ka. 
” 193 Rech says nothing about the crux of the matter. 
 And the crux of the matter is very simple: this trio is a mostarrant and shameless band of financial sharks and swin-dlers. 
 Etienne has had a hand in all the dirty scandalsinvolving millions, from Panama onwards . 
 He is an old hand at financial transactions in the colonies, like the one concerning our own Bashkir lands. 
 Jonnart took part inwhat was a no less “clean” business—securing the rich ironore deposits of Ouenza, Africa, as a concession. 
 His kith andkin sit on the boards of some of the largest joint-stock com-panies. 
 Baudin is a lieutenant of capitalists, contractors and shipyard owners. 
 The Naval Ministry is just the place for him—it is so much closer to contracts and to deliveriesfor the Navy! Marx’s statement that bourgeois governments are the lieutenants of the capitalist class194 has nowhere been confirmed more clearly than in France. 
 And the great prog-ress made by France is that the working class has torn offall sham coverings, that it has made the unclear clear, and“cast off from the chains the false flowers adorning them—not in order that mankind might continue to bear thosechains in their form, bare of all joy and all delight, but in order that it might cast off the chains and reach for the living flower”.

 to the Pravda text RESULTS OF THE ELECTIONS The Fourth Duma election campaign has confirmed the appraisal of the historical situation that Marxists havebeen giving since 1911. 
 The gist of that appraisal is that the first period of the history of Russian counter-revolu-tion is over. 
 The second period has begun, a period charac-terised by the awakening of “light contingents” of bourgeoisdemocrats (the student movement), by the aggressive eco-nomic, and still more non-economic, movement of the work-ing class, and so on. 
 Economic depression, the vigorous offensive of the coun-ter-revolution, the retreat and disintegration of the demo-cratic forces, and the spate of renegade, Vekhi , liquidation-ist ideas in the “progressive camp”—these are the dis-tinguishing features of the first period (1907-11). 
 As for thesecond period (1911-12), it is distinguished—economically, politically and ideologically—by the opposite features: an upswing in industry, the inability of the counter-revo-lution to press forward its offensive with the same force orvigour as before, etc. 
, and the revival of the democraticmovement, which forced Vekhi , renegade, liquidationist sentiments to conceal themselves . 
 Such is the general background of the picture, which has to be borne in mind if the election campaign of 1912is to be appraised accurately. 
 I. 
 MANIPULATING THE ELECTIONS The most striking characteristic of the elections to the Fourth Duma is their systematic rigging by the govern-ment. 
 It is not our aim here to sum up the results of “manipulating the elections”. 
 This has been commented on quite sufficiently by the entire liberal and democratic press, and the Cadets’ detailed interpellation in the Fourth Duma speaks of the same thing. 
 We shall probably be ableto devote a special article to this question when the vastand increasing documentary evidence has been collated. 
 For the time being we shall only note the principal re-sults of manipulating the elections, and the chief political significance of this manipulation. 
 The priesthood mobilised against the liberal and Octo-brist landlords; repressive measures increased tenfold, andthe law most unceremoniously violated to prejudice therights of the bourgeois democracy in town and country;attempts made to wrest the worker curia from the Social-Democrats by the same means—these are the principal meth-ods used in manipulating the 1912 elections. 
 The purposeof this policy, which is reminiscent of Bonapartist policy,was to form a Right-wing and nationalist majority in theDuma, and this aim, as we know, has not been achieved. 
But we shall see below that the government has succeeded in “upholding” the former, Third-Duma, situation in our parliament, if we may call it that: there remain two pos-sible majorities in the Fourth Duma, a Right-wing andOctobrist and an Octobrist-Cadet one. 
 The electoral law of June 3, 1907, “built” the state system of administration—and, indeed, not only of administra-tion—on a bloc of the feudal landlords and the top strata of the bourgeoisie, with the first-named social elementretaining a tremendous preponderance in this bloc, whileabove both elements stood a virtually uncurtailed old au-thority. 
 There is no need now to say what the specific natureof that authority, brought into being by the age-long his-tory of serfdom, etc. 
, has been and still is. 
 At all events, the shift in 1905, the collapse of the old state of affairs,and the open and powerful actions of the masses and classes,necessitated the search for an alliance with particular social forces. 
 The hopes pinned on the “uneducated” muzhik in 1905-06 (the Bulygin and Witte electoral laws) were shattered. 
 The July Third system “banked on the strong”, on the landlordsand the bourgeois big-wigs. 
 But in the course of a mere five years the experience of the Third Duma has begun to break this gamble as well! It would be hard to imagine greater servility than the Octobrists showed in 1907-12, and yet even they did not prove servile enough. 
 The old authority(the “bureaucracy”), which is closely akin to them in char-acter, was unable to get along even with them. 
 The bour-geois policy in the countryside (the law of November 9 196) and full assistance to capitalism were both directed by the very same Purishkeviches, and the results proved to be deplorable. 
 Purishkevichism—refurbished, repaired, andfreshened up with a new agrarian policy and a new systemof representative institutions—continued to crush every-thing and hamper progress. 
 The June Third system developed a crack. 
 “Manipula-tion” of the elections became inevitable, just as Bonapartist methods are historically inevitable when there is no solid,durable and tested integral social basis, and when there isa need to manoeuvre among heterogeneous elements. 
 If thedemocratic classes are powerless, or have been greatly weak-ened for temporary reasons, such methods may be attended by “success” over a number of years. 
 But even the “classical” examples of Bismarck in the sixties of the lastentury, or of Napoleon III, bear witness that things do notwork out without the most drastic changes (in Prussia itwas a “revolution from above” 197 and several exception-ally successful wars). 
 II. 
 THE NEW DUMA To ascertain the results of the elections, let us take the official data on the party composition of the Fourth Duma and compare it with that of the Third Duma, not only at the end of its existence (1912), but also at the beginning(1908). 
 We obtain the following instructive picture *: *The data are taken from the following Duma publications: Ukazatel (Directory ) for 1908, Spravochnik (Reference Book ) for 1912 and Spravochny Listok [IV] Gosudarstvennoi Dumy (Reference Sheet of the Fourth State Duma ) No. 
 14, December 2, 1912—corrected data as of December 1, 1912. 
 The three national groups are the Poles, Byelorussians and Moslems.

. 
 19 13 14 Unaffiliated .......... 
 —27 7 Total ....... 
 429 437 442 The first conclusion to be drawn from these data is that in the Fourth Duma the former two possible majorities remain—the Right-wing and Octobrist majority of 283 votes(65#120#98) and the Octobrist-Cadet majority of 226 votes (98 #48#59#21). 
 As far as the autocratic government is concerned, the most important thing for practical purposes is to have “its own” majority in the Duma. 
 The distinction between the Third and Fourth Dumas is negligible in this respect. 
 In the ThirdDuma, the Right-wing and Octobrist majority was 292votes at the beginning and 268 at the end. 
 What we have,now is 283, a figure midway between those two. 
 But the drop in the Right-wing majority between the beginning and the end of the Third Duma was so consider-able that the government, being an autocratic one, couldnot but resort to extraordinary measures of manipulatingthe elections. 
 That manipulation is neither an accidentnor a departure from the system, as the Meyendorfs, Mak-lakovs and Co. 
 like to make out, but a measure indis-pensable for maintaining the “system”. 
 You, liberal gentlemen headed by Maklakov, talk of “reconciling the government and the country” (i. 
e. 
, the bour-geoisie). 
 But if that is true, there are two alternatives. 
 Ei-ther your talk about reconciliation is not meaningless words, and then you must also accept “manipulating the elections”, for such is the real condition for reconciliation with the real government. 
 After all, you are so fond of “realistic policy”! Or your protests against “manipulating the elections” are not meaningless words, and then you should speak not of reconciliation, but of something entirely unlike reconcilia-tion. 
 The second majority of the June Third system, the Octo-brist-liberal one, was 252 votes in the early period of theThird Duma and 235 at its end, and it has dropped to 226 in the Fourth Duma. 
 Consequently, the government’s “elec-tion campaign” was in effect a success; the government hadits way, once again confirming its autocratic character inpractice. 
 For the cries about a Right-wing and nationalistmajority were merely haggling. 
 In reality, the governmentneeds both majorities, both of which have a counter-revolu-tionary basis. 
 It is impossible to lay too much stress on the last circum-stance, which the liberals gloss over in order to fool thedemocrats, while the liberal labour politicians (liquidators)do the same thing from lack of intelligence. 
 The bloc of theCadets and Octobrists, which came to light so strikingly during Rodzyanko’s election (and was perhaps even more strikingly revealed by the unseemly, slavish words of Rech about Rodzyanko’s speech), is by no means just a “tech-nical” matter. 
 This bloc expresses the community of thecounter-revolutionary sentiments of the bourgeoisie in gen-eral, from Guchkov to Milyukov; it is made possible only by these sentiments. 
 On the other hand, the government, too, needs the liberal-Octobrist majority from the point of view of the entiresystem of the June Third regime. 
 For the Third (and Fourth)Duma is not at all a “cardboard” institution, as it is oftenmade out to be by the claptrap of the “Left” Narodniks, who are bogged down hopelessly in Ropshin-like experiences and “otzovist” phrases. 
 198 No, the Third and Fourth Dumas are a stage in the development of the autocracy and in thatof the bourgeoisie; they are an attempt really to bring themcloser together, a necessary attempt after the victories anddefeats of 1905. 
 And the failure of this attempt would be the failure not only of Stolypin and Makarov, or of Markov the Second and Purishkevich, but also of the “conciliator ” Maklakov and Co . 
! The government needs a liberal-Octobrist majority in order to try to lead Russia forward while preserving the omnipotence of the Purishkeviches. 
 As regards instruments for curbing or moderating unusually fast-moving over-zealous liberal-Octobrist “Progressism”, the government hasplenty of them—the Council of State and many many more. 
 III. 
 CHANGES WITHIN THE JUNE THIRD SYSTEM The data quoted above provide interesting evidence of the evolution of the political parties, groupings and trendsamong the landlords and the bourgeoisie in the period ofcounter-revolution. 
 The composition of the Third andFourth Dumas hardly tells us anything about the bourgeois (peasant) or worker democrats, for the simple reason that the June Third system was devised with the express aim ofruling out the democrats. 
 In the same way, the non-Russianparties, i. 
e. 
, those not representing the “dominant” nation-ality, have been specially oppressed and stifled by theJune Third system. 
 We shall therefore pick out only the Rights, the Octobrists and the Russian liberals—parties which have made them-selves thoroughly comfortable within the June Third systemand are protected by it against the democrats—and look atthe changes that have occurred in these parties.

 78 88 107 #29”#37”” This shows clearly how the so-called “Centre” is dwin-dling among the privileged strata and how their Right and liberal wings are gaining strength. 
 It is interesting to notethat the number of liberals among the landlords and thebourgeoisie is growing faster than that of the Rights, despite the emergency measures taken by the government to rig the elections in favour of the Rights. 
 There are those who, in view of these facts, like to talk pompously about the aggravation of the contradictions ofthe June Third system, about the coming triumph of moder-ate bourgeois progressism, and so on. 
 They forget, firstly,that while the number of liberals is growing among the land-lords, and above all among the bourgeoisie, it is the Right wing of the liberals, which bases its policy entirely on “con-ciliation” with the Rights, that is growing fastest of all. 
 Weshall deal with this in detail in a moment. 
 Secondly, theyforget that the vaunted “move to the left of the bourgeoisie”is merely a symptom of the real move to the left of the demo-crats who alone are capable of providing the motive forces for a serious change in the regime. 
 Thirdly, they forget that the June Third system is specially intended to takeadvantage, within very broad limits, of the antagonism be-tween the liberal bourgeoisie and the reactionary nature ofthe landlords, there existing an even more profound com-mon antagonism between these and all democrats, partic-ularly the working class. 
 To proceed. 
 Our liberals like to pretend that the Octo-brists’ defeat was due to the “manipulation of the elections”,which took away support from this “party of the latestgovernment orders”, and so on. 
 Of course, in so doing theliberals themselves pose as an honest opposition, as inde-pendent people and, indeed, “democrats”, while the distinc-tion between a Maklakov and the Octobrists is in fact per-fectly illusory. 
 Look at the changes that have occurred between the Third and Fourth Dumas compared with those between the begin-ning and end of the Third Duma. 
 You will see that in the Third Duma the Octobrist Party lost a greater number of its members (28) than in the Fourth Duma elections (22). 
This, of course, does not mean that there was no “manipula-tion of the elections”, for it was done on the most recklessscale, especially against the democrats. 
 What it does meanis that despite manipulation of the elections in every sort of way, and even despite government pressure and “poli-tics” in general, a process of party demarcation is going onamong the propertied classes of Russia, the feudal reactionary Right wing of the counter-revolution becoming demarcated from the liberal-bourgeois wing of the same counter-revolution. 
 The distinctions between the various groups and fac-tions of the Right-wing and Octobrist Duma majority(Rights, nationalists, moderate Rights, the “Centre”, RightOctobrists, and so on) are as unstable, indefinite, acci-dental, and often artificially constructed, as the distinctions within the Octobrist-liberal majority (Left Octobrists, Progressists, Cadets). 
 What characterises the period we arepassing through is not at all that the allegedly independent(Maklakov, of all people!) Constitutional-Democrat is forc-ing out the Octobrists who are dependent on the govern-ment. 
 This is a silly liberal tale. 
 The characteristic thing is that genuine class parties are in course of formation and that, in particular, the partyof counter-revolutionary liberalism is becoming consoli-dated under cover of noisy oppositional exclamations andhoneyed talk about “reconciliation of the government andthe country”. 
 The liberal press, which is the most widespread in Russia, is doing its utmost to gloss over this process. 
 We shall there-fore turn once more to the precise data of the Duma statis-tics. 
 Let us remember that we must judge parties, as well asindividuals, by their deeds and not by their words. 
 As faras deeds are concerned, the Cadets and Progressists make common cause on all the more important issues, and both groups made common cause with the Octobrists in the Thirdand Fourth Dumas, and in the recent elections (Yekateri-noslav Gubernia: the Rodzyanko-Cadet bloc!) on a wholeseries of issues. 
 Let us now look at the data concerning the three parties. 
 Third Duma FourthComparison of Fourth DumaDuma and beginning 1908 1912of Third Duma Octobrists .... 
. 
 148 120 98 — 50, i. 
e. 
, —34 per cent Progress ists .... 
 253 6 4 8 #23”#92”” Cadets ...... 53 5259 # 6”#11”” We see an enormous and steady decrease of the Octobrists; a slight decrease, and then a small increase, of the Cadets; and an enormous and steady increase of the Progressists , who have almost doubled their numbers in five years. 
 If we take the data for 1908 reported by Mr. 
 Milyukov in Yezhegodnik Rechi * for 1912, p. 
 77, we shall see the picture in even bolder relief. 
 Mr. 
 Milyukov considers that in theThird Duma in 1908 there were 154 Octobrists, 23 Progress-ists and 56 Cadets. 
 Comparing the Fourth Duma with this, the increase in the number of Cadets is quite negligible andthe number of Progressists is more than double . 
 In 1908 the numerical strength of the Progressists was less than half that of the Cadets. 
 Today it is over 80 per cent ofthat of the Cadets. 
 Thus we arrive at the indisputable fact that the most characteristic feature of Russian liberalism during the coun-ter-revolution (1908-12) is the tremendous growth of Prog-ressism. 
 And who are the Progressists?Both by composition and ideology, they are a cross-breed of Octobrists and Cadets . 
 In the Third Duma the Progressists still called themselves Peaceful Renovators, and one of their leaders, the counter-revolutionary nobleman Lvov, was a Cadet in the FirstDuma. 
 The number of Progressists in the Third Duma in-creased, as we have seen, from 25 to 36, i. 
e. 
, by 11; of these 11 deputies, 9 came over to the Progressists from other par-ties, namely, 1 from the Cadets, 2 from the moderate Rights,1 from the nationalists and 5 from the Octobrists. 
 The rapid growth of the Progressists among the political exponents of Russian liberalism, and the success of Vekhi in “society” are two sides of the same medal. 
 The Progress-ists did in practical politics what Vekhi advocated in theo-ry as it spat at the revolution, repudiated democracy,extolled the dirty enrichment of the bourgeoisie as God’swork on earth, and so on and so forth. 
 In orating about reconciliation of the government and the country, the Cadet Maklakov merely sings the praise of what the Progressists are doing. 
 *Rech Yearbook . 
—Tr. 
 The further we move away from 1905 and 1906, the more obvious it becomes how very correct the Bolsheviks were at that time in exposing the Cadets when they were most exult-ant over their “victories”, and in showing the true natureof the Cadet Party * which is now being more and more glar-ingly revealed by the whole course of events. 
 The Russian democrats cannot win a single victory un-less they drastically undermine the Cadets’ “prestige” among the masses. 
 Conversely, the virtual fusion of the Ca-dets with Vekhi and the Progressists is a condition for, and a sign of, the strengthening and consolidation of the democrat-ic movement under the leadership of the proletariat. 
 IV. 
 WHAT WAS THE ISSUE IN THE ELECTIONS? In most of the statements and articles on the elections, this question is pushed into the background more than anyother, or is even obscured altogether. 
 Yet it is the questionof the ideological and political content of the election cam-paign, the most important question, one which has to be elucidated, or all other questions, and all the usual data on “opposition percentages” and so on, will completely losetheir value. 
 The most widespread reply to this question is that the issue was whether there was to be a constitution or not. 
That is how the Rights see it. 
 That is how the liberals see it. 
 The view that there were in effect two warring camps, one of them fighting for and the other against a constitution,runs through the entire Right-wing and liberal press. 
 Mr. 
Milyukov, the Cadet Party leader, and Rech , the official organ of that party, put forward this theory of two camps inno uncertain terms, doing so, moreover, on behalf of the conference of the Cadet Party. 
 But look at this “theory” from the standpoint of the outcome of the elections. 
 How did it stand the test ofreality? The first step of the new Duma was marked by a bloc of the Cadets and the Octobrists (and even some of the Rights) around the “constitutional” candidature of Rodzyanko, *See present edition, Vol. 
 10, pp. 
 199-276. 
— Ed. 
 whose speech, alleged to contain a constitutional pro-gramme, was enthusiastically acclaimed by the Cadets. 
 * The Octobrist leader Rodzyanko, who, as we know, is regarded as a Right Octobrist, considers himself a consti-tutionalist, as does Krupensky, the leader of the “Centrefaction”, or conservative constitutionalists. 
 To say that the issue was over the constitution means saying nothing, for the question at once arises as to what kind of constitution is meant. 
 Is it a constitution in the spirit of Krupensky or Rodzyanko or Yefremov-Lvov orMaklakov-Milyukov? And then comes an even more impor-tant question, one that does not concern wishes, statementsor programmes—all of which remain on paper—but thereal means of achieving the desired objective. 
 With regard to this cardinal point (the only serious one), Mr. 
 Gredeskul’s statement—reprinted by Rech (No. 
 117) in 1912—that there is no need for a new revolution, and thatwhat is needed is “merely constitutional work”, remainsunrefuted and irrefutably correct. 
 Ideologically and politi-cally , that statement unites the Cadets and Octobrists much more closely and thoroughly than the assurances of devo-tion to a constitution, and even to democracy—assurancesrepeated a thousand times—are supposed to divide them. 
 Probably some 90 per cent of all the newspapers read in Russia are Octobrist or liberal. 
 This press, by suggestingto the reader the idea of two camps, one of which favours a constitution, exerts an immensely corrupting influence on the political consciousness of the masses. 
 One has only tothink that all this campaign culminates in Rodzyanko’s“constitutional” declaration which Milyukov has accepted! In view of this state of affairs, one cannot insist suffi-ciently on repeating old truths of political science, truths that are forgotten by many people. 
 In Russia, the urgent question is: what is a constitution? A constitution is a deal between the historical forces of the old society (nobiliary, serf-owning, feudal, absolutist) *In addition to the Rech articles of the time, see Mr. 
 Milyukov’s statement in the Duma on December 13, 1912: “The Chairman [Rod-zyanko] delivered a speech ... he made his declaration, which we recognised to be our own ” (Rech No. 
 343, December 14)!! There you have the Cadets’ constitutional (don’t laugh!) declaration ! and the liberal bourgeoisie. 
 The actual terms of this deal, and the extent of the concessions made by the old order, or of the victories won by the liberal bourgeoisie, will depend on the victories of the democrats, of the broad mass of thepeople (primarily the workers), over the forces of theold. 
 Our election campaign could have its culmination in Milyukov’s acceptance of Rodzyanko’s “declaration” only because what the liberals are actually seeking is not abo-lition of the privileges (economic, political, etc. 
) of the old society, but their division between (to put it briefly) the landlords and the bourgeoisie. 
 The liberals are more afraidof the democrats’ popular, mass movement than they areof reaction; this accounts for the liberals’ impotence in pol-itics, which is amazing from the standpoint of the economic strength of capital. 
 In the June Third system, the liberals have a monopoly as a tolerated, semi-legal opposition, and the beginning ofa political revival (to use a much too weak and inaccurateterm) brings large sections of the new, rising generation of democrats under the influence of these monopolists. 
 That is why the essence of the issue of political liberty in Russia today amounts to making it clear that there are three andnot two warring camps, for it is only the latter camp, theone glossed over by the liberals, that really has the strength to achieve political liberty. 
 The issue in the elections of 1912 was not at all a “consti-tution”, for the Cadets—the chief liberal party, which main-ly attacked the Octobrists and defeated them—identifiedthemselves with Rodzyanko’s declaration. 
 The battle, heldfast in the police grip of the June Third system, was foughtover the awakening, strengthening and unification of an independent democratic movement free from the vacillation and “Octobrist sympathies” of the liberals. 
 That is why it is a fundamental mistake to see the real ideological and political content of the election campaignonly from the “parliamentary” standpoint. 
 What is a hun-dred times more real than all “constitutional” programmes and platforms is the question of the attitude of the various parties and groups towards the political strike movementwhich marked the year 1912. 
 One of the surest ways of distinguishing between the bourgeois parties of any country and its proletarian parties is to examine their attitude to economic strikes. 
 A party which in its press, its organisations and its statements inparliament does not fight together with the workers in eco-nomic strikes is a bourgeois party, no matter how much itmay avow that it is “popular”, “radically socialist”, and soon. 
 In Russia, mutatis mutandis (the appropriate changes having been made), the same must be said about parties that wish to pass for democratic: don’t invoke the fact thatyou have written on a certain slip of paper: “constitution,universal suffrage, freedom of association, equality of na-tionalities”, and so on, for these words are not worth a copper but show me your deeds in connection with the polit-ical strike movement of 1912! Even this criterion is not quite complete, but it is a serious criterion nevertheless, and not an empty promise. 
 V. 
 THE ELECTION SLOGANS TESTED BY EXPERIENCE An election campaign is of outstanding interest to any intelligent political leader because it furnishes objective data on the views and sentiments, and consequently inter-ests, of the different classes of society. 
 Elections to a repre-sentative body are comparable in this respect to a censusof the population, for they provide political statistics. 
 To be sure, these statistics may be good (in the case of uni-versal, etc. 
, suffrage) or bad (in the case of elections to ourparliament, if one may call it that). 
 To be sure, one mustlearn to criticise these statistics—just as any statistics—and to use them critically. 
 To be sure, these statistics shouldbe taken in connection with all social statistics in general; and strike statistics, for example, will often turn out—for those who are not affected with the disease of parliamentarycretinism—to be a hundred times more serious and profoundthan election statistics. 
 Despite all these reservations, it is beyond question that elections supply objective data. 
 Testing subjective wishes, sentiments and views by taking into account the vote of the mass of the population representing different classes should always be of value to a politician who is at all worthy of the name. 
 The struggle of parties—in practice, before the electorate, and with the returns summed up—invariably furnishes data serving to test our conception of the balance of the social forces in the country and of the significance ofparticular “slogans”. 
 It is from this standpoint that we shall try to look at the election returns. 
 Regarding political statistics, the chief thing that needs to be said here is the obvious worthlessness of the greater part of them owing to the shameless application of admin-istrative “measures”: “clarifications”, pressure, arrests,deportation, and so on and so forth—without limit. 
 Mr. 
Cherevanin, for example, who in Nasha Zarya No. 
 9-10 sums up data on several hundred electors in different curias, is compelled to admit that it “ would be ridiculous ” to take the drop in the percentage of opposition electors (comparedwith the elections to the Third Duma) in the second urbancuria and in the peasant curia as proof of a swing to theright. 
 The only curia in respect of which the Mymretsovs,Khvostovs, Tolmachovs, Muratovs and Co. 
 were unable t o carry out any rigging was the first urban curia. 
 That curia showed an increase in the proportion of “opposition” elect-ors from 56 to 67 per cent, with that of the Octobrists drop-ping from 20 to 12 per cent, and that of the Rights from 24to 21 per cent. 
 But while “clarifications” nullified the significance of election statistics regarding the electors, and while the democratic classes, excluded altogether from those privi-leged by the June Third system, personally experiencedall the delights of those clarifications, nevertheless theliberals’ attitude to the democrats became manifest in the elections. 
 On this point objective data came to light which make it possible to test, by the experience of life, what the different “trends” thought and said prior to the elections. 
 The question of the liberals’ attitude to the democrats is by no means “only a party” question, i. 
e. 
, one that isimportant only in terms of one of the strictly party lines. 
 It is the most important question for anyone striving for political liberty in Russia. 
 It is a question of how to achieve, after all, the object of the common aspirations of all that isdecent and honest in Russia. 
 The Marxists, in starting on the election campaign of 1912, put in the very forefront the slogans of consistent democracy as a counterpoise to liberal labour policy. 
 These slogans can be tested in two ways: firstly, by the view andexperience of other countries and, secondly, by the experi-ence of the campaign of 1912. 
 Whether the Marxists’ slogans are correct or not should now be evident from the relation-ship which has actually come into being between liberals and democrats. 
 What makes this test of slogans objective is that it is not we who tested them but the masses , and not merely the masses in general, but our opponents in particular. 
 Did the relations between liberals and democrats during and as a result of the elections develop as the Marxistsexpected or as the liberals expected or as the liquidators expected? To get at the root of this matter, let us first recall those “expectations”. 
 At the very beginning of 1912, when thequestion of elections had only just been raised and whenthe Cadets (at their conference) unfurled the banner of asingle opposition (i. 
e. 
, two camps ) and the permissibility of blocs with the Left Octobrists, the working-class press raised the question of slogans through the articles of Mar-tov and Dan in Zhivoye Dyelo , of F. 
 L—ko 199 and others in Zvezda (Nos. 
 11 [47] and 24 [60], and in Zhivoye Dyelo Nos. 
 2, 3 and 8). 
 Martov put forward the slogan: “Dislodge reaction from its Duma positions”, and Dan, “Wrest the Duma from the hands of the reactionaries”. 
 Martov and Dan accused Zvezda of threatening the liberals and of striving to extort Duma seats from the liberals. 
 Three positions stood out clearly: (1) The Cadets were for a single opposition (i. 
e. 
, for two camps) and for the permission of blocs with the Left Octo-brists. 
 (2) The liquidators favoured the slogan: “Wrest the Duma from the hands of the reactionaries” and facilitate the Ca-dets’ and Progressists’ “advance to power” (Martov in Zhi-voye Dyelo No. 
 2). 
 No extorting of seats from the liberals for the democrats. 
 (3) The Marxists were against the slogan: “Wrest the Duma from the hands of the reactionaries”, for that would mean wresting the landlord from the hands of the reaction-aries. 
 “The practical task that faces us at the elections is by no means to ‘dislodge reaction from its Duma positions’, but to strengthen the forces of democracy in general and ofworking-class democracy in particular” (F. 
 L—ko in Zvezda No. 
 11 [47]). 
 * We must threaten the liberals, extort seats from them, and go to war against them, undaunted by at-tempts at intimidation through cries about the Black-Hundred danger (same author, No. 
 24 [60] **). 
 The liberals “advance to power” only when the democrats win despite the vacillation of the liberals. 
 The divergency between the Marxists and the liquidators is most profound and irreconcilable, however easy variousgood souls may think a verbal reconciliation of the irrecon-cilable. 
 “Wrest the Duma from the hands of the reaction-aries” is a whole range of ideas, a whole system of policythat objectively means transferring hegemony to the liber-als. 
 “Wrest the democratic movement from the hands ofthe liberals” is the opposite system of policy, one basedon the fact that only a democratic movement which has ceased to be dependent on the liberals is capable of actually undermining reaction. 
 Now see what became in reality of the fight which was so much talked about before it began. 
 Let us take Mr. 
 V. 
 Levitsky of Nasha Zarya (No. 
 9-10) as a witness to the results of the fight—certainly no one will suspect this witness of partiality towards Zvezda a nd Pravda . 
 Here is how this witness assesses the results of the fight in the second urban curia, the only curia, as is known,where there was at least a remote resemblance to “Euro-pean” elections and where it is possible, at least to someslight degree, to sum up the results of the “encounters” between liberals and democrats. 
 The witness speaks of as many as 63 actions by the Social-Democrats, including 5 cases of forced renunciation of nomination, 5 agreements with other parties and 53 inde-pendent actions. 
 Of these 53 cases, 4 were in four big citiesand 49 during the election of electors. 
 *See present edition, Vol.

 In 9 cases out of these 49, it was not known whom the Social-Democrats were fighting against, in three it was against the Rights (whom they defeated in all three cases), in one against the Trudoviks (the Social-Democrats win-ning), and in the other 36 cases , against the liberals (21 vic-tories of the Social-Democrats and 15 defeats). 
 Picking out the Russian liberals, we have 21 cases in which the Social-Democrats fought them.

 Furthermore, out of five cases of agreement two were general agreements of the opposition against the Rights; in three “it may be a question of a Left bloc against the Cadets” (my italics; Nasha Zarya No. 
 9-10, p. 
 98). 
 In other words, the number of agreements was less than one-tenth ofthe total number of actions. 
 Sixty per cent of the agreementswere against the Cadets. 
 Lastly, the returns in four big cities were the following: Votes cast (maximum figures) Riga St.

 And so, in all the four big cities the Social-Democrats fought against the Cadets , who in one case won in the second ballot with help from the Octobrists (considering these to include the candidate of the Baltic Constitutional Party). 
 The conclusions drawn by the witness himself are: “The Cadet monopoly of representation of the urban democrats is coming to an end. 
 The Social-Democrats’ immediate task in thisfield is to win representation from the liberals in all the five citiesrepresented independently. 
 The psychological [??] and historical[what about economic?] preconditions for this—a ‘swing to the left’ of the democratic voter, the untenability of the Cadet policy, and the reawakening of proletarian initiative—already exist” ( Nasha Zarya , op. 
 cit. 
, p. 
 97). 
 VI. 
 “END” OF THE ILLUSIONS ABOUT THE CADET PARTY 1. 
 The facts have shown that the real meaning of the Cadet slogan of a “single opposition” or “two camps” wasdeception of the democrats, the liberals’ fraudulent appro-priation of the fruits of a democratic awakening, and theliberals’ curtailment , blunting and frustration of this awak-ening of the only force capable of pushing Russia ahead. 
 2. 
 The facts have shown that the only election struggle that was at all like the “open”, “European” type consistedprecisely in wresting the democratic movement from the hands of the liberals. 
 This slogan was a living reality , it expressed the awakening of a new democratic movement, an awakening that is actually taking place. 
 As for the liqui-dators’ slogan “Wrest the Duma from the hands of the reac-tionaries”, it was a rotten invention of a circle of liberalintellectuals. 
 3. 
 The facts have shown that only the “furious” struggle against the Cadets, and only the “Cadet-eating” of which the liberals’ spineless servants, the liquidators, accused us, expressed the real need of the real mass campaign, be-cause the Cadets actually turned out to be even worse than we had painted them. 
 The Cadets turned out to beoutright allies of the Black Hundreds against the Social-Democrat Priedkalns and the Social-Democrat Pokrovsky! 200 It is a historic turning-point in Russia: the Black Hun-dreds, who had gone to the length of blind hatred of theCadets, whom they saw as their chief enemy, were impelled by the course of events to back the Cadets against the Social-Democrats. 
 This seemingly minor fact denotes a very great shift in party policies, showing how superficial in fact were the Black-Hundred attacks on the Cadets and vice versa , and how easily in fact Purishkevich and Milyukov found their bearings , and came to their unity against the Social-Democrats. 
 Experience has shown that we Bolsheviks, far from under-estimating the possibility of blocs with the Cadets (at the second stage and so on), rather continued to overestimate it, for what actually occurred in a number of cases was the formation of blocks between the Cadets and the Octobristsagainst us! This, of course, does not mean that we refused (as certain over-zealous otzovists of yesterday and their friends would have liked us to do) in a number of cases, such as at gubernia election meetings, to resort to blocsbetween ourselves and the Cadets against the Rights. 
 Whatit does mean is that our general line (three camps; demo-crats against Cadets) was borne out and strengthened stillfurther by experience. 
 Incidentally, Levitsky, Cherevanin and other contribu-tors to Nasha Zarya collected valuable data for our election statistics with the most commendable zeal and diligence. 
 Itis a pity they did not sum up the data—which they evidentlyhad—on the number of cases of direct and indirect blocs ofthe Cadets with the Octobrists and Rights against the Social-Democrats. 
 Priedkalns and Pokrovsky are not isolated cases, for there were many other cases of a similar nature at the guber-nia election meetings. 
 They should not be forgotten. 
 Theyare worthy of serious attention. 
 To proceed. 
 Our “witness”, who had to draw the above conclusions about the Cadets, gave no thought at all to the appraisal of the Cadet Party that these conclusions bore out. 
 Who called the Cadets a party of urban democrats? And who had argued since March 1906 , or even earlier, that this liberal party kept itself alive by deceiving the demo-cratic voter? Now the liquidators have begun to chant like so many Forgetful Ivans: “The Cadet monopoly is coming to an end. 
”Consequently, there was a “monopoly”. 
 What does this mean? Monopoly is the removal of competition. 
 Was Social-Democratic competition against the Cadets in 1906-07 removed to a greater extent than in 1912? Mr. 
 V. 
 Levitsky repeats a common phrase without think-ing of the meaning of the words he is uttering. 
 As he under-stands it, monopoly means “simply” that the Cadets predo-minated and that this is over now. 
 But if you claim to beMarxists, gentlemen, you should really ponder, if only a little bit, on the class character of parties, and not treat so flippantly your own statements of yesterday. 
 If the Cadets are a party of urban democrats, then their predominance is not a “monopoly”, but a product of theclass interests of the urban democrats! If, however, their predominance turned out, a couple of years later, to be a “monopoly”, i. 
e. 
, something accidental and abnormal from the standpoint of the general and fundamental laws of capi-talism and relations between the classes in capitalist society, it follows that those who took the Cadets for a party of urban democrats were opportunists, that they were carried awayby a short-lived success, bowed down before the fashionable splendour of Cadetism, and abandoned Marxist criticism of the Cadets for liberal servility to them. 
 Mr. 
 V. 
 Levitsky’s conclusion bears out entirely , word for word , the resolution on the class character of the Cadet Party adopted by the Bolsheviks in London in 1907, aresolution which the Mensheviks vehemently disputed. 
 If the urban democrats followed the lead of the Cadets “ by force of tradition and because they were simply deceived by the liber-als”, as the resolution has it, then it is perfectly logical that the severe lessons of 1908-11 dispelled “constitutionalillusions”, undermined “tradition”, exposed the “deceit”and thereby ended the “monopoly”. 
 Wilful or involuntary oblivion of the past, and an ex-tremely thoughtless attitude towards precise, straightfor-ward and clear answers to all important political questionsand to verifying these answers by the ample experience of1905-07 and 1908-12, is a much too widespread phenomenonnowadays. 
 Nothing could be so ruinous to the awakening democratic movement as this oblivion and this attitude. 
 /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR VII. 
 CONCERNING AN “ENORMOUS DANGER TO THE LANDOWNERSHIP OF THE NOBILITY” Mr. 
 Cherevanin, summing up the results of the election campaign, holds that the opposition had “49 seats wrestedfrom it in a purely artificial manner, solely through recourseto quite exceptional measures”. 
 In his opinion, addingthese seats to those that were really won would raise the total to 207, which is only 15 short of an absolute majority. 
 The conclusion he draws is: “On the basis of the June Thirdsystem, barring artificial emergency measures, nobiliary-feudal reaction would have been fully and decisively [??!]defeated in the elections. 
” “In the face of this enormous danger to the landownership of the nobility,” he goes on to say, “clashes between priests and land-lords are unimportant” (op. 
 cit. 
, p. 
 85). 
 There you have the effects of the slogan of wresting the Duma from the hands of the reactionaries! Cherevanin has sorely punished Martov by reducing the latter’s slogan to an absurdity and confirming, so to say, the results of liqui-dationist illusions along with the “results of the electioncampaign”. 
 A Progressist and Cadet majority in the Fourth Duma would have represented an “ enormous danger to the landown-ership of the nobility ”! This is a real gem. 
 It is not a slip of the pen, however, but an inevitable result of the entire ideological content which the liberalsand liquidators tried to impart to the election campaign. 
 The tremendous growth of the role of the Progressists compared with the Cadets, the Progressists’ embodiment in politics of the entire renegacy (Vekhism) of the Cadets, and the virtual transition to a Progressist position which theCadets themselves effected tacitly and secretly, are allfacts which the liquidators refused to see and which brought them to the “Cherevanin” gem. 
 “One should not talk toomuch about the counter-revolutionary character of the Cadets” is what, or approximately what, the Trudovik (Narodnik liquidator) Mr. 
 Vodovozov wrote at one time. 
Our liquidators took the same view. 
 They even forgot the lesson of the Third Duma, where the Cadet Berezovsky in an official speech “interpreted” the Cadets’ agrarian programme, and proved it to be beneficial to the landed nobility. 
 Think of expecting now, in 1912, an “enormous danger to the landownership of the nobility” from the “opposition” Duma of the landlords, or from theProgressists, those slightly repainted Octobrists. 
 Look here, Mr. 
 Cherevanin, indulge in your fantasies, but have a sense of proportion! We have an excellent illustration of the election results in connection with the Cherevanin summary of liquida-tionist tactics. 
 The Fourth Duma approved, by 132 votesto 78, the Progressist formula of procedure. 
 None other than the Octobrist Antonov officially expressed his complete satisfaction with this most commonplace,empty formula as being an Octobrist one! Mr. 
 Antonov is right, of course. 
 The Progressists submitted a purely Octo-brist formula. 
 They played their role, that of reconcilingthe Octobrists with the Cadets. 
 Octobrism has been defeated, long live Octobrism! It is Guchkov Octobrism that has been “defeated” and the onethat lives on is Octobrism of the Yefremov and Lvov brand. 
 * VIII. 
 COVERING UP THE DEFEAT It remains for us to examine the election returns for the worker curia, which is the most important. 
 No one has had, or has, any doubt that this curia is on the side of the Social-Democrats. 
 The fight waged here was not against the Narodniks, among whom resistance toNarodnik liquidationism ( Pochin 201 in Paris and the Popu-lar Socialists in St. 
 Petersburg) or Narodnik otzovism did not occur , and this lack of resistance to decadent trends reduced the Left Narodniks to nil. 
 The fight in the worker curia was waged only between the Marxists and the liberal labour politicians, the liqui-dators. 
 In January 1912 the Marxists proclaimed franklyand clearly, openly and without any despicable evasions, *Rech asserted on December 16 that the Social-Democrats had joined in voting for the Progressists’ vile formula. 
 That is incredible. 
Pravda says nothing about it. 
 Perhaps the Social-Democrats who were sitting (or who rose to leave?) were “registered” as voting for. 
 that agreements in the worker curia (and in it alone) with the destroyers of the workers’ Party were impermissible. 
 * This fact is common knowledge. 
 It is also common knowl-edge that the liquidators’ August conference was describedeven by the conciliator Plekhanov as “pitiful” and liquida-tionist (despite the vows of Nasha Zarya ), and its resolutions as “ diplomacy ”, or deceit, to put it plainly. 
 What did the election returns show? Did they, or did they not, provide objective data as to the relation of the January and August statements to reali-ty? Whom did the working-class electors prove to be support-ing? There are very precise statistical data on this, which the liquidators are trying (in vain!) to obscure, to hide, to drown with outcries and abuse. 
 Beginning with the Second Duma (the First Duma was boycotted by most of the Social-Democrats), there are exactdata on the number of deputies to the Duma from the workercuria, distributed among the various “trends” in the Social-Democratic Party. 
 Here they are: Deputies elected to the Duma from the worker curia: Percentage Mensheviks Bolsheviks of Bolsheviks Second Duma (1907) ... 1211 47 Third ” (1908-12) . 
. 
 44 5 0 Fourth ” (1912) ... 36 6 7 These figures speak for themselves! In 1907 the Bolsheviks had a majority, registered offi-cially, in the Party (105 Bolshevik and 97 Menshevik dele-gates). 
 This means that the 47 per cent in the worker curia (the entire group comprised 18 Bolsheviks $36 Menshe-viks=54) made up about 52 per cent in the workers’ Party. 
 In 1912, for the first time, all the six curia deputies were Bolsheviks. 
 It is known that those six gubernias are theprincipal industrial gubernias. 
 It is also known that a fargreater proportion of the proletariat is concentrated in them than in the other gubernias. 
 It is obvious, therefore, and has *See present edition, Vol. 
 17, p. 
 469. 
— Ed. 
 been fully proved by a comparison with 1907, that 67 per cent in the worker curia mean more than 70 per cent in the workers’ Party. 
 During the Third Duma, when the intelligentsia deserted the workers’ Party and the liquidators justified this, theworkers abandoned the liquidators. 
 The liquidator Belo-usov’s flight from the Social-Democratic group in the ThirdDuma, and the turn of the whole group (three-quarters Menshevik) from Menshevism to anti-liquidationism * were signs and sure indications of the fact that the same process was going on among the workers. 
 And the elections to theFourth Duma proved this. 
 That is why Oskarov, Martov, Cherevanin, Levitsky, etc. 
, are incredibly indignant in Nasha Zarya , flinging hundreds of the most Purishkevichist “compliments” at an alleged circle that is alleged to be sectarian and Leninist. 
 Sectarian circle indeed! A “circle” that in 1908-12 got from the worker curia steadily increasing support—reaching67 per cent of that curia in the Fourth Duma! They areclumsy polemicists, are the liquidators. 
 They abuse ** us as strongly as they can, but the result is the most flattering compliment for us. 
 Settling controversial issues by an abundance of outcries, abuse and groundless assertions is just like a circle of intel-lectuals. 
 The workers prefer something different, namely,objective data. 
 And in Russia, her present political position *The liquidator Oskarov admits this indisputable fact in an amus-ing manner, saying that the Bolsheviks “ had their way : they split the group at the critical moment, in fact if not in form” ( Nasha Zarya , op. 
 cit. 
, p. 
 3)—meaning the Third Duma group. 
 What he calls a “split” is either the liquidator Belousov’s flight, or the fact that two members of the group were on a liquidationist newspaper and eight on an anti-liquidationist one, while the rest were neutral. 
 **The liquidators most readily raise a hullaballoo about St. 
 Petersburg, bypassing the results of the elections for the worker curia,as if to say, “For shame!” It is a shame, of course, gentlemen! The shame is on those against whom a mandate was adopted that had been printed beforehand, i. 
e. 
, approved by the organisation. 
 It is disgrace-ful to back a person against a mandate . 
 And it was still more dis-graceful to refuse to cast lots when the result turned out to be 3 : 3. 
P. 
, a Pravda man well known in St. 
 Petersburg, plainly suggested casting lots to the liquidator M. 
, but the latter rejected it!! Shame on the liquidators for the St. 
 Petersburg elections! being what it is, there is not, and cannot be, an objective measure of the strength and influence of a particular trend among the mass of the workers other than the working-class press and the worker curia of the Duma. 
 Therefore, liquidator gentlemen, the more you clamour and rail in Nasha Zarya and Luch , the more calmly we shall ask the workers to point out an objective criterion of con-nection with the masses other than the working-class press and the worker curia in the Duma. 
 Let the readers who are being deafened with cries about the “sectarian” “Lenin circle” and so on ponder calmly theseobjective data on the working-class press and the workercuria in the Duma. 
 These objective data show that theliquidators are shouting to cover up their complete defeat. 
 But it is particularly instructive to compare the coming into being of Luch , which appeared on the day of elections owing to private initiative, and the coming into being ofPravda . 
 The April surge of the working-class movement was one of the greatest historic surges of the workers’ massmovement in Russia. 
 Even according to estimates made by factory-owners, hundreds of thousands of workers joined in the movement. 
 And that movement itself created “Pravda ” as its by-product—first by strengthening Zvezda and convert-ing it from a weekly into a newspaper appearing every twodays, and then by increasing workers’ money collections forPravda to 76 in March and 227 in April (taking into account only group contributions by workers). 
 We have here a classical example of how a movement that has absolutely nothing to do with reformism, brings asa by-product either reforms or concessions, or an extensionof bounds, and so on. 
 The reformists are betraying the working-class movement when they restrict its great scope by reformist slogans (as do our liquidators). 
 The opponents of reformism, however,not only prove loyal to the uncurtailed slogans of the pro-letariat, but also turn out to be the better “practical work-ers”, for it is precisely broad scope and uncurtailed slogansthat ensure the strength which yields, as a by-product, either a concession or a reform, or an extension of bounds, or at least a temporary necessity for the upper ranks to toleratea disagreeable increase in the activity of the lower ranks. 
 In 1908-12, while the liquidators were busy reviling the “underground”, justifying “flight” from it and chattering about an “open party”, the entire worker curia left them, and they were unable to use the first, and great, upsurge ofthe April-May tide! Mr. 
 Martov in Nasha Zarya admits this circumstance which is so sad for him, couching his admission in particu-larly amusing terms. 
 He reviles and describes as nonentities the Plekhanov and Vperyod groups, which the liquidators themselves were depicting only yesterday as “centres” and trends, in defiance of our demand that only Russian organi-sations should be taken into account. 
 And Martov admitsbitterly and angrily, amid a torrent of venomous (venomousin a Burenin style) words, that “Lenin’s” “sectarian circle” “stood its ground” and “is even taking the offen-sive”, “having entrenched itself in fields that have nothing incommon with the underground” ( Nasha Zarya , op. 
 cit. 
, p. 
 74). 
 But this whole admission of Martov’s evokes a smile. 
 It is human nature that when the enemy makes a mistakewe rejoice maliciously, but when he takes the right step we sometimes get into a childish temper. 
 Thank you for the compliment you were forced to pay us, liberal liquidator! Since the end of 1908 we have been insist-ing on the use of open forms of the movement, and in thespring of 1909 we broke with a number of friends 202 over it. 
 And if in these “fields” we proved to be a force, it was only because we did not sacrifice content for form. 
 To use the form in good time, to seize hold of the April upsurge, and towin the sympathy, so precious to a Marxist, of the workercuria, it was essential not to renounce the old, not to treatit in a renegade fashion, but firmly to uphold its ideas, itstraditions, its material substrata. 
 It was those ideas that imbued the April upsurge, it was they that predominated in the worker curia in 1912, and only those who were loyal tothem in all fields and all forms could advance in step bothwith that upsurge and with that curia.

 Ilyin EXPERIENCE TEACHES Anyone who is sincerely interested in the fortunes of the emancipation movement in our country cannot fail to be interested primarily in our working-class movement. 
 The years of upswing, as well as those of counter-revolution,showed beyond all doubt that the working class is marchingat the head of all the liberation forces and that therefore the fortunes of the working-class movement are most closely interwoven with those of the Russian social movement in general. 
 Take the curve indicating the workers’ strike movement during the past eight years! And try to draw a similar curveshowing the growth and decline of Russia’s entire emancipa-tion movement in general during these years. 
 The two curves will coincide perfectly. 
 There is a very close, an insepa-rable connection between the emancipation movement as awhole, on the one hand, and the working-class movement, onthe other. 
 Look closely at the data on the strike movement in Russia since 1905. 
 Number of strikesYear Number of strikers(thousands) 1905 13,995 2,863 1906 6,114 1,1081907 3,573 740 1908 892176 1909 340 641910 222 471911 466 1051912 approximately 1,500,000 strikers (economic and political) Surely these data show most clearly that the Russian workers’ strike movement is the best barometer of the entire nation-wide emancipation struggle in Russia. 
 There were about three million strikers in the peak year (1905). 
 In 1906 and 1907 the movement ebbed but continuedat a very high level, averaging one million strikers. 
 Thenit headed downwards and kept on declining to 1910 inclu-sive: the year 1911 was the turning-point, for the curve began to rise, even though timidly. 
 The year 1912 saw a new major upswing. 
 The curve rose confidently and steadily to the1906 level, making plainly for the year when, at the figure ofthree million, it established a world record. 
 A new epoch has come. 
 This is now beyond all question. 
 The beginning of 1913 is the best evidence of it. 
 The mass of the workers is advancing from individual partial issues to the point where it will raise the general issue. 
 The at-tention of the widest masses is now centred on somethingmore than particular defects in our Russian life. 
 It is nowa question of the totality of these defects, taken as a whole: it is now a question of reform, not reforms. 
 Experience teaches. 
 The actual struggle is the best solver of the problems which until recently were so debatable. 
Take a look now, after 1912, at, say, our disputes over the“petitioning campaign” and the slogan “freedom of asso-ciation”. 
 What has experience shown? It turned out to be impossible to collect even a few tens of thousands of workers’ signatures to a very moderate petition. 
 On the other hand, it is a fact that political strikes alone involved a million people. 
 The talk that one should not go beyond the slogan “freedom of association”, because if onedid the masses would allegedly not understand us and wouldrefuse to mobilise, turned out to be meaningless and idle talk by people isolated from the realities of life. 
 The living, real millions of the masses, however, mobilised precisely insupport of the broadest, the old, uncurtailed formulas. 
 Itwas only these formulas that fired the masses with enthu-siasm. 
 It has now been shown convincingly enough who hasactually been advancing with the masses and who without or against them. 
 A fresh, vigorous and mighty movement of the masses themselves is sweeping aside as worthless rubbish the arti-ficial formulas hatched in government offices, and marches on and on. 
 That is what constitutes the historic significance of the great movement taking place under our own eyes. 
 Pravda No. 
 15, January 19, 1913 Published according to the Pravda text NEW DEMOCRATS In his “Motley Encounters” published in the New-Year issue of Rech , Mr. 
 Tan touched on an important question to which the workers should pay serious attention. 
 It is the question of the growing numbers of new democrats. 
 “For about a year or perhaps more,” wrote Mr. 
 Tan, “the river of life has been changing and shifting again. 
 Instead of the water decreasing, there has been an increase, coming from God knows where probably from the bowels of the earth and from distant springs. 
 Allwas quiet and empty for three years. 
 Now there are people appearingcrawling one after another out of various crevices and dark corners .... 
 “People of peasant stock who have come up from below are the most interesting. 
 Their name is legion. 
 They have flooded the middle walks of life and are even aiming at the higher ones, especially in the provinces. 
 Technicians, accountants, agronomists teachers, all sortsof Zemstvo clerks. 
 They are all alike—grey-faced broad-boned, un-couth-looking; they are not liable to reflexes, and are, indeed, as toughas cats .... 
 Life must have taken yet another step upwards, for we com-moners compared with them are as the nobility were compared with us. 
” This is very apt and true, although we should not forget that the old as well as the new commoners, those “of peasantstock”, the democratic intelligentsia and semi-intelligentsia,represent the bourgeoisie as distinct from the semi-feudalnobility. 
 But the bourgeoisie consists of different strata having dif-ferent historical possibilities. 
 The upper ranks of the bour-geoisie and of the wealthy bourgeois intelligentsia—lawyers,professors, journalists, deputies, etc. 
—almost invariablygravitate towards an alliance with the Purishkeviches. 
 Thou-sands of economic threads link this bourgeoisie to them. 
 On the other hand, the peasant bourgeoisie and the new intelligentsia “of peasant stock” are linked by a thousand threads to the mass of the disfranchised, downtrodden, ignorant, starving peasantry, and by virtue of all their liv-ing conditions are hostile to all Purishkevichism, to any alliance with it. 
 This new democratic element, which is more numerous and stands closer to the life of the millions, is rapidly learning,gaining strength and growing. 
 It is for the most part fullof vague opposition sentiments and feeds on liberal trash. 
 One of the great and responsible tasks of the politically-con-scious workers is to help these democrats to get rid of theinfluence of liberal prejudices. 
 Only in so far as they over-come these prejudices, cast off the wretched burden of liberalillusions, break with the liberals and hold out, their hand tothe workers are they, Russia’s new democrats, destined to do something real for the cause of freedom. 
 Pravda No. 
 15, January 19, 1913 Published according Signed: T. 
 to the Pravda text ON NARODISM Mr. 
 A. 
 V. 
 P. 
203 has contributed to Russkoye Bogatstvo No. 
 12 a “leading” article on a “current” subject, headed“Socialism—Popular or Proletarian?” The article is quite shallow and pointless in itself. 
 It is quite a long time since we encountered in the “leading” arti-cles of a Narodnik publication that considers itself impor-tant, such a meaningless set of words, such a spate of evasive,bald phrases, or such a hotchpotch of (eclectic) views. 
 But the characteristic thing about the article is that it raises the highly important and topical question of the disintegration of Narodism. 
 Narodism is the ideology ofRussia’s peasant democrats. 
 That is why every class-conscious worker should carefully watch the changes thisideology is undergoing. 
 I Narodism is very old. 
 It is considered to have been founded by Herzen and Chernyshevsky. 
 Effective Narodismreached its peak when, in the seventies, revolutionaries began to “go among the people” (the peasantry). 
 The Narodniks’ economic theory was developed in its more integral form byV. 
 V. 
 (Vorontsov) and Nikolai—on, 204 in the eighties of the last century. 
 In the early twentieth century, the viewsof the Left Narodniks were expressed in the most definiteform by the Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
 The revolution of 1905, which showed all the social forces of Russia in an open, mass action of the classes, made ageneral test of Narodism and defined its place. 
 The only real content and social significance of Narodism is peasant democracy. 
 The Russian liberal bourgeoisie is compelled, by virtue of its economic position, to strive not for the abolition , but for the division of the privileges of Purishkevich and Co. 
 between the feudal landlords and the capitalists. 
 On theother hand, the bourgeois democrats in Russia—the peas-ants—are compelled to strive for the abolition of all these privileges. 
 For the Narodniks, phrases about “socialism”, “sociali-sation of the land”, equalised tenure, and so on, are merewords covering up the fact that the peasants are strivingfor complete equality in politics and for the complete aboli-tion of feudal landownership. 
 The revolution of 1905 finally revealed this social essence of Narodism, this class nature of it. 
 The movement of themasses—in the form of the peasant unions of 1905, the localpeasant struggles in 1905 and 1906, and the elections to thefirst two Dumas (the formation of “Trudovik” groups)—allthese great social facts, which showed us millions of peasants in action , swept aside Narodnik, professedly socialist, phrase-mongering like so much dust and revealed the core: apeasant (bourgeois) democratic movement with an immense,still unexhausted store of energy. 
 Those whom the experience of the greatest epoch in new, modern, Russia has not taught to distinguish between the real content of Narodism and its verbal trappings are hope-less and cannot be taken seriously, they may be writersplaying with words (like A. 
 V. 
 P. 
 of Russkoye Bogatstvo ), but not politicians. 
 In our next article we shall look more closely at the disin-tegration of Narodism and at that writer. 
 II The experience of 1905 is vastly important precisely because it compelled the testing of Narodnik theories by the movement of the masses. 
 And that test at once brought about the decay of Narodism and the collapse of Narodniktheories. 
 At the very first congress of the Socialist-Revolutionaries, in December 1905, the Popular Socialists began to break away from them, and they had seceded completely by the autumn of 1906. 
 Those Popular Socialists forestalled our liquidators. 
 They chanted in exactly the same way about an “open party”,and in the same way they abolished the slogans of consist-ent democracy and made renegade speeches (see, for example, Mr. 
 Peshekhonov’s articles in Russkoye Bogatstvo No. 
 8, 1906). 
 Those were peasant Cadets, and the Second Duma(which was not boycotted by the Narodniks, nor even by the Socialist-Revolutionaries) proved that the majority of the peasant deputies followed the opportunists of Russkoye Bogatstvo , with the minority following the Socialist-Revolu-tionaries. 
 The Second Duma finally confirmed what was evident already from the Narodnik newspapers of the “daysof freedom” (autumn 1905 and spring 1906), namely, thatthe Socialist-Revolutionaries could be nothing but the Leftwing of Russia’s peasant democrats and that outside it theywere nothing. 
 The disintegration of Narodism is bearing this out more and more clearly. 
 While the counter-revolution was ram-pant, this disintegration progressed rapidly: the Left Narod-niks “recalled” themselves from the ranks of the DumaTrudoviks. 
 The old party was virtually liquidated but nonew one was founded. 
 Renegacy (which went as far as Rop-shin’s disgraceful writings “The Pale Horse” and “That Which Was Not”) obtained a wide path for itself even to the“Left” Narodniks. 
 Some of them (the Pochin group) are abandoning the boycott. 
 Others gravitate towards Marxism(N. 
 Sukhanov, for example, although he is still exceedinglymuddled). 
 Still others gravitate towards anarchism. 
 All in all, the break-up is far greater than among the Social-Democrats, for while there are official centres, there is no clear, consistent, principled line capable of combating de-cadence. 
 And now Mr. 
 A. 
 V. 
 P. 
 presents us with an example of this ideological decadence. 
 Once the Narodniks had a theory of their own. 
 What is left now is nothing but “reservations” on Marxism picked up at random. 
 Any unprincipled feuille-ton-writer for a glib bourgeois sheet could subscribe to Mr. 
 A. 
 V. 
 P. 
’s article in defence of “popular” socialism without risking anything, without committing himself in any way, and without professing anything . 
 For “popular” socialism is a meaningless phrase serving to evade the question of which class or social stratum is fighting for socialism throughoutthe world. 
 It suffices to quote two specimens of Mr. 
 A. 
 V. 
 P. 
’s twad-dle. 
 “It appears,” he wrote, “that the party which has made the doc-trine of proletarian socialism its own is in reality prepared to developits forces also at the expense of other, ‘semi-proletarian’, or even‘bourgeois’, strata. 
” An objection fit for a fourth-year schoolboy, isn’t it? Both semi-proletarians and bourgeois are to be found inthe socialist parties of the whole world, so what follows ? It follows, Mr. 
 A. 
 V. 
 P. 
 concludes, that one may side-stepthe fact that only the proletariat all over the world (1) wages a sustained struggle against the capitalist class and (2) pro-vides a mass support for the Social-Democratic parties. 
 Another example: “Take the students,” wrote the glib Mr. 
 A. 
 V. 
 P. 
 “Why, they are the most genuine bourgeoisie, and yet the socialists among them—I cannot say how it is now—until recently were almost a majority. 
” Now isn’t that inimitable? Isn’t that an argument worthy of a naïve Socialist-Revolutionary schoolgirl? He does not notice, after 1905-07, how tens of millions of peasants and millions of workers took sides in the arena of all politicalactions, while attaching importance ( as if it were an argu-ment against “proletarian socialism”!) to the fact that the liberal and democratic student youth in Russia sympathiseswith the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Social-Democrats! Look here, Mr. 
 A. 
 V. 
 P. 
, have a sense of proportion! Class-conscious workers must follow a straightforward and clear policy with regard to the Narodniks. 
 They mustruthlessly ridicule would-be socialist phrases and not allow the only serious question, that of consistent democracy , to be hidden behind them . 
 “Popular” socialism, equalised tenure, socialisation of the land, co-operation, the labour principle? All that is not evenworth refuting. 
 Experience and the revolution have long since swept it altogether out of the sphere of serious politi-cal issues. 
 You are merely hiding the serious question, that of democracy , behind that sort of twaddle. 
 You must say clearly and plainly whether you are loyal to the slogansof consistent democracy. 
 Are you willing and able to trans-form these slogans into regular work among the masses of a clearly specified social stratum? If so, the worker democratwill be your ally and friend against all enemies of democ-racy. 
 If not, go away, you are just a twaddler.

 TO THE SOCIAL-DEMOCRAT S205 We reprint in full the leading article of the latest issue of the St. 
 Petersburg newspaper Luch (January 19, 1913, No. 
 15—101): “THE MASS OF THE WORKERS AND THE UNDERGROUND “The authorities have again refused to register the metalworkers’ union. 
 Despite all the concessions which the workers were willing to make, the department found every single clause unacceptable. 
It makes no difference whether the force operating here was the asso-ciation of factory-owners, which insisted, as the newspapers oncereported, that the metalworkers should not be allowed to set up anew trade union, or whether the department itself decided to prevent the rise of such a union. 
 The most progressive and most cultured sec-tion of the St. 
 Petersburg workers is being deprived even of the miser-able right they enjoyed under the provisional regulations on unionsand associations! How much energy has been spent, how many liveshave been lost in the struggle to win this bit of a right, which is nowreduced to nought with a wave of the hand! “Strangest of all is the fact that the wide mass of the workers do not at all react to this disfranchisement. 
 Indeed, as a result of thelatest persecution of legal organisations, sympathy for the ‘under-ground ’ is reviving and growing here and there among the workers. 
 We are far from shutting our eyes to this fact, which we find deplora-ble. 
 But not being accustomed to worship spontaneity, we are trying to realise the meaning of this fact. 
 “The present talk about the ‘underground’ is largely reminiscent of the old disputes—now thoroughly forgotten, it seems—about terrorism. 
 Terrorism, too, was ‘worshipped ’ by many who wanted to mask their own worthlessness. 
 It is well, they seemed to say, thatthere exist heroes; as for us, we’ll trail somehow behind them. 
 The same thing is happening now. 
 We are too lazy to think, to seek new paths, and we are waiting for the underground to decide for us, andthen we shall act at other people’s risk. 
 If we succeed, well and good,and if not, we shall know who is to blame. 
 “It is exactly this psychology—which, we admit, is rooted in our present political situation and is sufficiently explained by the heavy sacrifices already made for the sake of an open movement— this psychology of irresponsibility, of a subconscious desire to prove one’s absence in the event of failure, that inspires certain sectionsof the mass of the workers with a resurgent respect for the under-ground. 
 We say respect for the underground, not flight into it, be-cause it is always single individuals alone who have actually been underground—the masses have nothing to do underground—andthose individuals, who are accountable to no one, have had commandover mass actions. 
 “But, it is said, ‘legal opportunities’ have all been exhausted resulting in an almost complete destruction of the legal organisations. 
 And it is this that is wrong, to say that all opportunities have been exhausted. 
 Actually, the main opportunity, without which any vic-tory of the working class is unthinkable, has been used very littleso far. 
 We have spoken of the masses’ methodical participation inupholding their organisations. 
 What has been done so far has beendone neither methodically enough nor with the masses participating in sufficient measure. 
 Thousands of signatures put to a petition for freedom of association are nothing compared with the hundreds ofthousands of factory workers. 
 The dozens and rarely hundreds ofmembers of our trade union, educational and various other associa-tions are but a drop in the bucket compared with the huge numbersof workers engaged in a given trade, living in a given district, and so on. 
 And the fact is that those who take a real interest in unions and work in them are still fewer. 
 “The masses, who assign the pick of the working-class intelligent-sia the most dangerous posts in legal organisations, readily give up,and are willing to abandon the cause itself, when those foremostchampions have been snatched out of their ranks. 
 Herein lies the root of the weakness of the working-class movement today, and it is here that there is a virgin field for stubborn and persevering Social-Democratic work. 
” It would be hard to imagine a more complete, more exact and more eloquent document shedding light on the vexedquestions of our Social-Democratic Party than this article.

 B. 
 Axelrod, F. 
 Dan V. 
 Yezhov, Levitsky, Potresov, Martov, Martynov and others. 
 To comment on this leader in detail, one would have to write a whole volume repeating what Marxists of all trends have said against the liquidators in the press during 1909-12. 
 Let us only point out certain things. 
 Sympathy for the underground is reviving and growing among the mass of the workers, and respect for it is resurgent. 
 He who con-siders this fact deplorable is a liberal and not a Social-Democrat, a counter-revolutionary and not a democrat. 
 Comparing the underground with terrorism is an unheard-of affront to revolutionary work among the masses. 
 Only the underground poses and solves problems of the growing rev-olution, directing revolutionary Social-Democratic work and attracting the mass of the workers precisely by this work. 
 The underground has been and is today drawn from the finest and most class-conscious of the foremost workers, those dearest to the masses. 
 The link between the under-ground and the masses now can be, and often is, evenbroader and closer than before, chiefly owing to the greater class-consciousness of the masses, and in part also to “legal opportunities”. 
 The talk of an open party is stupid andbase, but as far as our Social-Democratic Party nuclei are con-cerned, “legal opportunities” for their work among the masses have by no means been exhausted, and cannot be “exhausted”. 
 Is it possible that the leading article in Luch No. 
 101 will not rouse the ire of all Social-Democrats? Will there be even a single “trend” among the Social-Democrats tolerantof such propaganda? Can this summarising leading article fail to assist in settling the vexed question of the unity of the Social-Demo-cratic Party? The diplomats of liquidationism have been completely exposed in Luch No. 
 101. 
 They stand unmasked. 
 From now on, only hypocrites can talk about unity with the liquida-tionist group of Luch and Nasha Zarya . 
 It is time those Social-Democrats who so far have wavered for various reasons, who have given no explicit answer tothe question under discussion, who have in an evasive formpermitted “agreement” with Luch and sought to cloak their solidarity with Luch by talk about “unity”—it is high time they stopped wavering and spoke out plainly. 
 Unity with Luch is impossible, while unity against Luch is perfectly possible and urgently necessary. 
 For the pointat issue is unity of the “ underground ”, of the illegal Social-Democratic Party, the R.

 Written on January 22 (February 4), 1913 Hectographed in leaflet form Published according in Cracow, late January, 1913 to the leaflet text IN THE WORL D OF THE AZEF S206 The nationalist press raised a terrible clamour over the Alyokhin “incident”. 
 What! The Austrians had insulted Russia by arresting an innocent Russian engineer on a charge of espionage and by outraging the arrested man! There wereendless “patriotic” sallies against Austria. 
 And now the whole background has come to light—the simple, old, long-familiar background of the affair. 
 Mr. 
Alyokhin was a victim of Weissmann, an Austrian police agent, who had been shadowing Russian spies in Austria for 2,000 kronen (800 rubles) a month. 
 The Russian engineer, who knows no German and is evi-dently a semi-savage as well, naïvely fell for the bait ofthe agent provocateur , who showed him round the arse-nals. 
 Novoye Vremya and our other papers of a Black-Hundred and government trend defend Russian Azefs with all their might. 
 But when an Azef turned out to be in the Austrianservice, those well-intentioned Russian patriots were firedwith “righteous” indignation. 
 But it turned out, in addition, that Weissmann is a former Russian spy and agent provocateur . 
 The career of this Weiss-mann is most instructive. 
 His father kept a brothel. 
 The son, after this sort of school-ing, became a Russian spy in Vienna, Austria, where healso spied on Russian political exiles. 
 Thus, from 1901 to1905, Weissmann was in the service of the Russian police, being simultaneously a military and a political spy. 
 Subsequently Weissmann fell out with the Russian policeand passed into the service of the Austrian police. 
 All very simple. 
 Poor Alyokhin was the victim of a former Russian spy. 
 Now how can the servile Russian newspapers help being indignant at this “treachery” on the part of Austria? Pravda No.

 to the Pravda text THE BOURGEOISIE AND REFORMISM The arguments of Rech concerning the urgent issue of strikes deserve the greatest attention on the part of theworkers. 
 That liberal paper cited the following official data on the strike movement: Year Strikes Workers (thousands) 1905 13,995 2,863 1906 6,114 1,108 1907 3,573 740 1908 892176 1909 340 64 1910 222 47 1911 466 105 19121,918 683 We would note in passing that the figures for 1912 are plainly understated, since the number of political strikers is given as only 511,000. 
 Actually their number was about twice as great. 
 We would also recall that as late as May 1912Rech denied the political character of our working-class movement, asserting that the whole movement was only eco-nomic. 
 But we intend to deal now with another aspect ofthe matter. 
 How does our liberal bourgeoisie assess this fact? “The main requirements of the political consciousness [why only consciousness ??] of Russian citizens have yet to be met,” wrote Rech . 
 “The working class everywhere is the most mobile and most sen-sitive section of the urban democrats ... the most active section ofthe people .... 
 G iven constitutional conditions ... given a normal political situation ... there would not have been the loss of tens of thousands of working days [because of the Putilov strike] in an in-dustry which today is of extreme importance in view of externalcomplications” (No. 
 19). 
 The point of view of the bourgeoisie is clear. 
 “We” want an imperialist policy, the conquest of foreign territory. 
 “We” are handicapped by strikes. 
 “We” lose surplus value because of the “lost” working days. 
 “We” want to exploit theworkers as “normally” as they do it in Europe. 
 Splendid, liberal gentlemen! Your desire is legitimate, and we are willing to support your effort if— if it is not futile and dead! Rech continued: “It was not out of sympathy for liberties that Prussian statesmen [it ought to have said “Prussianlandlords”] granted ‘ the legalisation of the Social-Democratic Party ’. 
 Reforms bear proper fruit when granted in good time. 
” Such is the consummate reformism of our bourgeoisie. 
 It confines itself to wistful sighs; it wants to persuade the Purishkeviches without hurting their feelings, to make peacewith them without removing them. 
 It should be clear to anyintelligent person that by virtue of its objective meaning (that is, regardless of the good intentions of individuallittle groups), the slogan of “legalisation of the Social-Democratic Party” is an inseparable component of this wretched and impotent bourgeois reformism. 
 We would make only one remark. 
 Bismarck succeeded in his reforms only because he went further than reformism. 
As we know, he carried out a series of “revolutions fromabove”; he robbed one of the world’s richest countries of five thousand million francs, and he was in a position to give universal suffrage and genuine legality to a people intoxi-cated with a stream of gold and unprecedented militarysuccesses. 
 Do you imagine, liberal gentlemen, that something of the kind could happen in Russia?? Why, then, did you declare reforms in Russia to be hopeless even in the case of the Archangel Zemstvo (a “reform”, indeed!)?? Pravda No.

 to the Pravda text APROPOS OF THE OPEN PARTY Luch , a newspaper which succeeds in making the more “clamour” among circles of the intelligentsia the less the workers read it, continues its advocacy of an open workers ’ party with a zeal worthy of a better cause. 
 In the New-Year leading article of the paper we read an old untruth, namely, that the year 1912 “put forward, asits current slogan and as the militant banner of the Russiaof the workers, the struggle for freedom of association and the struggle for the open existence of the Social-Democratic Labour Party”. 
 Anyone who really came into contact with the workers’ mass movement in 1912 and carefully observed its politicalcharacter knows very well that the liquidators of Luch are telling an untruth. 
 What the workers did put forward as their current slogan and militant banner was something else . 
 This was particularly evident, for example, in May, when theforemost workers of different trends (even with a Narodnikminority participating along with the Social-Democraticmajority) themselves put forward a different slogan and un-furled a different “militant banner”. 
 The intellectuals of Luch know that, but they are trying to impose their want of faith, their narrow understanding and their opportunism on the workers. 
 A familiar picture with nothing new about it! In Russia, however, the authorsof this distortion are able to put it forward all the moreeasily because it has the monopoly of “open” expression in certain fields. 
 For all that, the untruth of Luch remains an untruth. 
 And it becomes worse when Luch continues: “It is this slogan that will form the pivot of the political mobil-isation of the mass of the workers in 1913.... 
” In other words, in defiance of the mass of the workers, who have already advanced a different slogan, the intellectu-als of Luch are going to dock and curtail it! You are free to do that, gentlemen, but what you are promoting is aliberal and not a Social-Democratic cause. 
 Let the reader recall the recent controversy between Luch and Pravda over an open party. 
 Why is it that even the Cadets were unable to found an open party?— Pravda asked. 
 * And F. 
 D. 
, writing in Luch , replied: “The Cadets recognised that their desire was utopian” when they failed to get their Rules approved; as for the liquidators, they carriedon “stubborn methodical work, winning one position after another”(see Luch No. 
 73). 
 You see: F. 
 D. 
 evaded giving a reply! The Cadets, too, carried on stubborn work and they, too, were “winning posi-tions” in legal publications and legal unions. 
 But even theCadets have no open party . 
 Why, then, do the Cadets continue to dream and talk of an open party? Because they are the party of the counter-revolutionary liberal bourgeoisie, which is willing to make peace with the Purishkeviches for certain little concessions to the liberals, for the little concession of a “peaceful”open Cadet party. 
 That is the objective significance—which does not depend on good wishes and fine words—of the talk about an open party under the June Third regime. 
 This talk is a repudia-tion of consistent democracy, and an advocacy of peace with the Purishkeviches. 
 It is unimportant what aims the liquidators pursue by their advocacy of an open party, or what their intentionsand expectations are. 
 That is a subjective question; it is well known that the road to hell is paved with “good” intentions. 
 What is important is the objective significanceof the advocacy of an open workers’ party under the JuneThird regime, with a non-open liberal party, etc. 
 *See pp. 
 432-34 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 This objective significance of the liquidators’ talk about an open party is a repudiation of the popular and fundamen-tal conditions and demands of democracy. 
 That Is why every politically-conscious worker reacts adversely to the liquidators’ propaganda, for the issue ofan open party” is a fundamental question, one that con-cerns the very existence of the working-class Party. 
 It is the very existence of a genuine workers’ party that is being radically undermined by liquidationist propaganda.

 to the Pravda text MOBILISATION OF PEASANT LANDS Mobilisation of land is the transfer of landownership from one person to another. 
 With regard to our peasants,both our legislation and our “public” opinion (even liberal opinion, as expressed by the Cadets) still maintain the feudal view that mobilisation of peasant lands is harmful and should be prohibited or restricted. 
 From the democratic point of view, the very assumption that peasants—adult persons and full-fledged citizens—may be prohibited from or impeded in selling their land is a most shameless affront to the peasantry. 
 Only in a country like Russia, where all government officials and the bulkof the liberals still cling to the old, feudal view of the“muzhik” as being slow-witted, underprivileged and requir-ing tutelage, can this attitude to mobilisation persist. 
 From the economic point of view, the harm caused by all prohibition and restriction of mobilisation is enormous. 
 Given living conditions that are at all tolerable, the peasantwill never sell his land. 
 On the other hand, when want or other conditions (resettlement, death of the breadwinner,and so on) compel a peasant to sell his land, no law can stop him. 
 The law will always be bypassed, and bans will merely worsen the terms of sale of the land. 
 In the January issue of Russkaya Mysl , the mouthpiece of the extreme Right-wing Cadets, a cross-breed of liberalsand Black Hundreds, a certain Prince V. 
 Obolensky, whoapparently shares the usual Black-Hundred and liberal viewon mobilisation, was compelled to cite facts proving the stupidity and harm of all restrictions on it. 
 Non-peasants are prohibited from buying allotments. 
 So they register aspeasants! Or a person is prohibited from buying more than six per capita allotments. 
 So he signs fictitious, fraudulent deeds in the name of his relatives, and so on! Or he is prohibited from mortgaging allotment land. 
 This makes speculative deals all the easier and the purchase of landby middle peasants all the more difficult! Only feudal-minded people and hypocrites can expect restrictions on mobilisation to “relieve” the peasantry. 
 Asfar as the politically-conscious peasants are concerned, they seek an entirely different solution.

 to the Pravda text A WORD ABOUT STRIKES Luch has carried a number of articles against mass strikes. 
 It is obvious that we cannot reply to Luch here in the way it deserves. 
 We shall limit ourselves to a few purely theoretical com-ments on the nature of the arguments of Luch . 
 Those who write for Luch and who diligently cite examples from West-ern countries, repeating the catchword “anarcho-syndical-ism” and so on in a thousand variations, thereby betraytheir complete incomprehension of the historical peculiarity of the strikes in Russia in 1912. 
 Nowhere in Europe have strikes in the twentieth century had, and nowhere do they have or can they have, such impor-tance as in the Russia of the period we are passing through. 
Why? For the simple reason that while the period of radical democratic changes has long been absolutely over through-out Europe, in Russia it is just such changes that are on theorder of the day—in the historical sense of the phrase. 
 Hence the nation-wide character of the economic, and still more of the non-economic, strikes in Russia. 
 Strikesin Europe, where they herald entirely different changes, do not possess such a nation-wide character (from the stand-point of democratic changes in the country). 
 Moreover, therelation between the strikes in Russia and the positionof the agricultural small producers (peasants) is quite un-like what it is in the Western countries. 
 Putting all this together, we shall see that the arguments of Luch leave out of account precisely the national, demo-cratic significance of the economic and non-economic strikesin the Russia of 1912. 
 The most important and historically distinctive feature of our strikes is the fact that the proletar-iat comes forward as the leader despite the anti-democratic sentiments of the liberals. 
 And it is just this that the Luch writers do not understand, and cannot understand fromtheir liquidationist standpoint. 
 Of course, the point is not at all to appraise the advisa-bility of any particular strike. 
 It is not at all that the mostmethodical preparations are necessary and sometimes even the replacement of a strike by an action of the same kind . 
 The point is the liquidators’ general incomprehension of this particular significance of strikes in general which makes the slogan of “freedom of association” or of an “open party”unsuitable, out of keeping with the existing situation. 
 What the liquidators see as a disadvantage is the entire character of the movement and not particular cases, while the Marxists and all class-conscious workers see it as anadvantage. 
 That is why the workers have been incensed,and continue to be incensed, by Luch ’s propaganda.

 to the Pravda text RUSSIANS AND NEGROES What a strange comparison, the reader may think. 
 How can a race be compared with a nation? It is a permissible comparison. 
 The Negroes were the last to be freed from slavery, and they still bear, more than anyone else, the cruel marks of slavery—even in ad-vanced countries—for capitalism has no “room” for otherthan legal emancipation, and even the latter it curtails inevery possible way. 
 With regard to the Russians, history has it that they were “almost” freed from serf bondage in 1861. 
 It was about the same time, following the civil war against the Americanslaveowners, that North America’s Negroes were freed fromslavery. 
 The emancipation of the American slaves took place in a less “reformative” manner than that of the Russian slaves. 
 That is why today, half a century later, the Russians still show many more traces of slavery than the Negroes. 
 Indeed, it would be more accurate to speak of institutions and notmerely of traces. 
 But in this short article we shall limitourselves to a little illustration of what we have said, name-ly, the question of literacy. 
 It is known that illiteracy is one of the marks of slavery. 
 In a country oppressed by pashas, Purishkeviches and their like, the majority of thepopulation cannot be literate. 
 In Russia there are 73 per cent of illiterates , exclusive of children under nine years of age. 
 Among the U. 
S. 
 Negroes, there were (in 1900) 44. 
5 per cent of illiterates. 
 Such a scandalously high percentage of illiterates is a disgrace to a civilised, advanced country like the North American Republic. 
 Furthermore, everyone knows that the position of the Negroes in America in general is one un-worthy of a civilised country—capitalism cannot give either complete emancipation or even complete equality. 
 It is instructive that among the whites in America the proportion of illiterates is not more than 6 per cent. 
 Butif we divide America into what were formerly slave-holdingareas (an American “Russia”) and non-slave-holding areas (an American non-Russia), we shall find 11-12 per cent of illiterates among the whites in the former and 4-6 per cent in the latter areas! The proportion of illiterates among the whites is twice as high in the former slave-holding areas. 
 It is not only the Negroes that show traces of slavery! Shame on America for the plight of the Negroes! Written late January-early February 1913 First published in Published according Krasnaya Niva No.

 A DISCOVERY Bourgeois society lives and subsists exclusively by the wage labour of the millions. 
 Failing this, neither the in-comes of the landlords, nor the profits of the capitalists, nor yet the various “derivative” sources of a life of plenty,such as royalties, salaries, etc. 
, would be possible. 
 And theforce which drives the millions into the ranks of wagelabourers is hunger. 
 This is an old, universally known, hackneyed fact. 
 The bourgeois public gets used to it and “does not notice” it. 
 But from time to time glaring cases of want and povertyside by side with luxury compel “discoveries” to be made,particularly if the health and well-being of the bourgeoisgentlemen are endangered! Once in a while they “discover”,in every big city and any rural backwoods, appalling, abom-inable squalor, want and neglect unworthy of human beings. 
 They “discover” them, inform the public through the “big”newspapers, comment on the fact for a day or two, and thenforget it. 
 The sated do not understand the hungry. 
 Recently in St. 
 Petersburg a Dr. 
 Kozlovsky, who inspected 251 lodging rooms in Rozhdestvensky District, acquainted the public with a “discovery” of this kind. 
 “Dark, damp rooms, suffocating air, squalor, people sleeping on trunks or on the floor, horrible overcrowding (3,578 tenants in 251lodging rooms), crushed bugs on the walls—an appalling picture”(Novoye Vremya , No. 
 13236). 
 The public health society which heard the report resolved to study the problem, to make representations ... to ask for an investigation—i. 
e. 
, it did all it could. 
 A few figures from St. 
 Petersburg statistics for 1911. 
 The Special Department for the Investigation and Accommoda-tion of Paupers had 16,960 paupers entrusted to its care. 
 Of these, 1,761 were handed over to the courts —next time they will know better than to disturb clean people!—1,371were sent back to their native parts (the countryside is“accustomed” to having paupers on its hands), 1,892 re-mained to be cared for in the institutions of the Department, and 9,694 were released . 
 People did work hard in the Department, after all— they “investigated”; they do not get their salaries fornothing. 
 The same year 1911 saw 43,156 unskilled workers apply for employment to the city labour exchange (beyond Moskov-skaya Zastava). 
 Work was found for 6,076 men. 
 The “released” (those freed from “care” in the case of the paupers and from jobs in the case of unskilled labour) spendthe night in the street, in doss-houses, in lodging rooms.... 
They are material for discoveries.

 The Conference passed a resolution against war, and by a considerable majority passed another resolution callingon the Party’s representatives in Parliament to vote againstany electoral reform Bill that does not extend the franchiseto women. 
 The British Labour Party, which exists side by side with the opportunist Independent Labour Party and the Social-Democratic British Socialist Party, is something in thenature of a broad labour party . 
 It is a compromise between a socialist party and non-socialist trade unions. 
 This compromise resulted from the peculiarities of British history and the segregation of the labour aristocracy in non-socialist, liberal trade unions. 
 These unions havebegun to turn towards socialism, and this gives rise to ahost of intermediate, confused situations. 
 On Party discipline, for example, a resolution was adopted threatening expulsion from the Party for violation of the decisions of the Party or of the Parliamentary group . 
 Disputes arose that would be impossible in any other country—as to whether this resolution is directed againstthe Liberals or against the Socialists? The fact is that out of forty Labour M. 
P. 
s, 27 are non-Socialists !! In opposing the resolution, the Socialist Will Thorne said they wanted to tie the hands of the thirteen Socialists by subordinating them to the non-Socialists . 
 Even Bruce Glasier, of the I. 
L. 
P. 
, while supporting the resolution, admitted that there are about half a dozen Labour M. 
P. 
s whose place is among the Conservatives. 
 The resolution was carried. 
 A resolution that not only the posters of the opportunist Daily Herald207 be displayed in Party premises was defeated by 643,000 votes to 398,000. 
 The voting here is calculatedaccording to the number of members which each delegationrepresents. 
 The majority at the Conference consisted of non-Social-ists and extremely bad Socialists. 
 But definite voices wereheard indicating that the mass of the workers are dissatis-fied with such a party and they demand that their M. 
P. 
sshould do less playing at legislation and more socialistpropaganda.

 30, Febr uary 6, 1913 Published according to the Pravda text CONSTITUTIONAL ILLUSIONS SHATTERED “We have a constitution, thank God!” exclaimed Mr. 
 Milyukov after June 3, 1907. 
 The leader of the liberal bourgeoisie sought comfort in amusing assertions of this kind, while concealing its distrust of the people and itsreluctance, its fear, to depart from the “constitutional”path. 
 Most characteristically, it is just now, when the same Mr. 
 Milyukov or his prim, official-minded liberal Rech acknowledges the “beginning of a social upswing” (No. 
 26), that the collapse of these constitutional illusions is becomingobvious. 
 Underlying these illusions is the desire to dismissan unpleasant reality (and the unpleasant necessity oftaking a path that does not resemble the “constitutional”one), the desire to lull oneself and others with “constitu-tional” catchwords. 
 And now look what the liberals have to say of the present situation! “It is dull in the Duma because there is no struggle going on” (No. 
 25). 
 Well, gentlemen, it was you who said we had a constitu-tion! “All the words have been spoken. 
 What is needed now is deeds, but there is no faith in them . 
 Hence the apathy” (ibid. 
). 
 You lulled yourselves with faith in words , which you addressed chiefly to the Octobrists. 
 Now you admit that you spoke those words to cover up lack of faith in deeds . 
 You have condemned yourselves, liberal gentlemen. 
 Democrats in general, and workers in particular, have had no faith in words (about the constitution)— * Written late January -early February 1913 Published according Published for the first time to the manuscript *Part of the MS.

 THANK YOU FOR YOUR FRANKNESS We wish to thank the Black-Hundred Novoye Vremya for publishing a frank statement by Kobylinsky, leader of theRights on the Council of State. 
 We also wish to thank the “leader” himself. 
 “Every now and again,” Mr. 
 Kobylinsky exclaimed, “members of the Duma betray ignorance and inability to legislate.... 
 Only shopkeepers draft laws like that .... 
 “We have been attacked for rejecting the Bill to introduce the Zemstvo in Archangel Gubernia.... 
 The Duma did not stop for a mo-ment to think that owing to the absence of cultured elements andthe sparse population in Archangel Gubernia, people there wouldhave to elect, as a wit put it, a muzhik , a reindeer and a bear to the Zemstvo council.... 
 “Be that as it may, we shall not allow the establishment of a muzhik Zemstvo, as the Third Duma envisaged it. 
” Well, how can we help thanking the leader of the Rights on the Council of State, i. 
e. 
, the leader of the Council of State, for being so frank? We wholeheartedly recommend to the reader this clear and truthful argument for the Council of State instead of the hackneyed, non-committal liberal phrases against the Council of State. 
 Shopkeepers in the Duma ... muzhiks and bears in the Zemstvo ... we shall admit no shopkeepers or muzhiks. 
 Thereyou have the plain language of a feudal-minded landlord. 
 And mind you, he is right, is this feudal lord, in saying that there is no majority in the Duma without the “shop-keepers”, i. 
e. 
, without the bourgeoisie , to use the language of a class conscious worker (and not of a wild landlord 208). 
 He is right, is this feudal lord, in saying that self-govern-ment would in fact be peasant self-government (the class-conscious workers prefer the term peasant t o muzhik , which is current among wild landlords). 
 The peasants are a majority. 
 The Council of State is by no means an accidental politi-cal institution but a class organ—this is what Kobylinsky’s truthful speech implies. 
 The class in question is that of thebig landlords. 
 They will admit no “shopkeepers or muzhiks”. 
 Really, Russian liberal “shopkeepers”, and Octobrist and Cadet gentlemen, you must learn from Kobylinsky how to pose political questions seriously! Pravda No. 
 35, Febr uary 12, 1913 Published according to the Pravda text THE QUESTION OF UNITY The letter which Shagov, the Kostroma workers’ deputy, wrote to Pravda (No. 
 22—226) indicated very clearly the terms on which the workers think Social-Democratic unity feasible. 
 Letters from a number of other deputies for theworker curia ( Pravda Nos. 
 21-28) confirmed this view. 
 The workers themselves must bring about unity “from below”. 
The liquidators should not fight the underground but shouldform part of it. 
 It is amazing that after the question has been posed so clearly and squarely we come across Trotsky’s old, pompousbut perfectly meaningless phrases in Luch No. 
 27 (113). 
 Not a word on the substance of the matter! Not the slightest attempt to cite precise facts and analyse them thoroughly! Not a hint of the real terms of unity! Empty exclamations, high-flown words, and haughty sallies against opponents whom the author does not name, and impressively importantassurances—that is Trotsky’s total stock-in-trade. 
 That won’t do, gentlemen. 
 You speak “to the workers” as though they were children , now trying to scare them with terrible words (“the shackles of the circle method”, “mon-strous polemics”, “the feudal-serf-owning period of our Party history”), now “coaxing” them, as one coaxes small children,without either convincing them or explaining matters tothem. 
 The workers will not be intimidated or coaxed. 
 They themselves will compare Luch and Pravda ; they will read, for example, the leading article in Luch No. 
 101 (“The Mass of the Workers and the Underground”), and simplyshrug off Trotsky’s verbiage. 
 “In practice the question of the underground, alleged to be one of principle, is decided by all Social-Democratic groups absolutely alike ...,” Trotsky wrote in italics. 
 The St. 
 Petersburg workers know from experience that that is not so. 
Workers in any corner of Russia, as soon as they read theLuch leading article mentioned above, will see that Trotsky is departing from the truth. 
 “It is ridiculous and absurd to affirm,” we read in his ar-ticle, “that there is an irreconcilable contradiction between the political tendencies of Luch a nd Pravda . 
” Believe us, my dear author, that neither the word “absurd” nor the word“ridiculous” can frighten the workers, who will ask you tospeak to them as to adults on the substance of the matter : just expound those tendencies and prove that the leading article in Luch No. 
 101 can he “reconciled” with Social-Democracy! You cannot satisfy the workers with mere phrases, no mat-ter how “conciliatory” or honeyed. 
 “Our historic factions, Bolshevism and Menshevism, are purely intellectualist formations in origin,” wrote Trotsky. 
 This is the repetition of a liberal tale. 
 In fact, however, the whole of Russian reality confronted the workers with the issue of the attitude to the liberals and the peasantry. 
 Even if there had been no intelligentsia, the workers could not have evaded the issue of whether they should follow the liberals or lead the peasantry against the liberals. 
 It is to the advantage of the liberals to pretend that this fundamental basis of the differences was introduced by “intellectuals”. 
 But Trotsky merely disgraces himself by echoing a liberal tale. 
 Pravda No. 
 39, Febr uary 16, 1913 Published according to the Pravda text WHAT GOES ON AMONG THE NARODNIKS AND WHAT GOES ON IN THE COUNTRYSIDE The magazine Russkoye Bogatstvo shows us the two streams of the Narodnik or Trudovik current or trend in Russian life that can also be traced by drawing on other, more direct andimmediate sources of political knowledge. 
 Let us recall, for example, the debates in the First and Second Dumas. 
 Unfortunately, the verbatim reports of bothhave been withdrawn from sale. 
 Nevertheless, the immense political material they provide for studying the views and aspirations of the Russian peasantry and Russian Trudovikshas in part already become, and in part will in the futurebecome, known to every educated person. 
 The chief conclu-sion to be drawn from this material is that the Trudovikintellectuals (including the Socialist-Revolutionary intellec-tuals) and the peasant Trudoviks represent essentially dis-tinct political trends. 
 The intellectual Narodniks gravitate towards conciliatory or “philanthropic” phrases. 
 One always senses the liberal inthem. 
 The standpoint of the class struggle is wholly foreignto them. 
 They are given to moralising. 
 They are pulling the democratic peasantry back from the real and direct struggle against its class enemy to vague, forced, impotent, quasi-socialist phrase-mongering. 
 The peasant Narodniks in both of the early Dumas were full of fire and passion. 
 They were eager for direct and reso-lute action. 
 They were ignorant, uneducated and unsophisti-cated, but they rose against their class enemy so straightfor-wardly, uncompromisingly and implacably that one sensed what an impressive social force they were. 
 In other words, the Narodnik intellectuals are very bad socialists and lukewarm democrats. 
 The peasant Trudoviks are far from playing at socialism, which is quite alien to them, but they are honest, sincere, ardent and strong demo-crats. 
 No one can foretell whether peasant democracy willwin in Russia, for this depends on much too complicatedobjective conditions. 
 But it is beyond doubt that the Trudo-vik peasantry could win only in spite of the tendencies which the Narodnik intelligentsia brings into the movement of the Trudovik peasantry. 
 A vigorous, fresh and sincere democrat-ic movement can win, given a favourable historical situa-tion, whereas “socialist” phrase-mongering and Narodnik moralising can never win. 
 I consider this conclusion to be one of the most important lessons of the Russian revolution, and I cherish the hope that some day I may be able to substantiate it by a detailedanalysis of Narodnik speeches in the first two Dumas andby other political evidence from the 1905-07 period. 
 For thetime being I should like to note the remarkable confirmationof this conclusion to be found in the latest issue (No. 
 12, 1912) of Russkoye Bogatstvo , the chief and most authorita-tive Narodnik organ. 
 Two articles in that issue produce an impression that is undoubtedly typical. 
 Mr. 
 A. 
 V. 
 P. 
’s article (“Socialism—Popular or Proletarian?”) is a specimen of the intellectual-ist arguments of the “Popular Socialists” and Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
 If it had been inevitable for the massive force of the Rus-sian peasantry to be directed in the way that “results”from the arguments of Messrs. 
 A. 
 V. 
 P. 
 and Co. 
, the cause of Russia’s bourgeois democrats would have been hopelesslylost. 
 For phrase-mongering and moralising can never result in history-making action . 
 The impotence of this kind o f Narodism is complete. 
 In Mr. 
 Kryukov’s article, “Without Fire”, the peas-antry and peasant life and psychology are described bya honey-tongued little priest, who portrays the peasant-ry in just the way it itself has acted, and continues to act. 
 If this portrayal is accurate, Russia’s bourgeois democrats—in the shape of the peasantry—are destinedto carry out a major historical action that has every chance of success provided the situation is at all favourable. 
 To make this point clear, we shall briefly describe Mr. 
 A. 
 V. 
 P. 
’s “ideas” and quote a few passages from the por-trayal of the Russian peasantry given by the littlepriest. 
 Mr. 
 A. 
 V. 
 P. 
 defends the foundations of Narodism against Sukhanov, a writer for Zavety , who surrenders a whole series of cardinal theoretical premises of Narodism to Marx-ism, advocating a kind of unity between Marxists andNarodniks. 
 Mr. 
 A. 
 V. 
 P. 
 has no objection to unity but does not pro-pose to “surrender” the principles of Narodism. 
 And it isprecisely this defence of the purity of the principles and of the solidity of Narodism by such an unquestionably compe-tent and noted Narodnik as Mr. 
 A. 
 V. 
 P. 
 that shows mostclearly that his position is quite hopeless and that this kind of Narodism is absolutely lifeless . 
 Mr. 
 Sukhanov went as far as to say that the proletariat was the only class which was socialist by nature. 
 Of course, if we were to reason with any degree of consistency, this means recognising Marxism and completely giving upNarodnik socialism as a bad job. 
 Mr. 
 A. 
 V. 
 P. 
 is up in arms against Mr. 
 Sukhanov, but his arguments are exceptionally lame. 
 They are nothing but somany little reservations, rectifications, question marks, and eclectic comments to the effect that revisionism “over-emphasises” life’s corrections to theory, while orthodoxywastes its time disputing them. 
 The hotchpotch dished upby Mr. 
 A. 
 V. 
 P. 
 exactly resembles the objections of the“humanitarian” bourgeois to the class struggle and classsocialism—objections common in all European countries. 
 Mr. 
 A. 
 V. 
 P. 
 does not venture to deny the fundamental and well-known fact that throughout the world it is onlythe proletariat that wages a systematic, daily struggleagainst capital, and that it alone constitutes the mass bul-wark of the socialist parties. 
 And Mr. 
 A. 
 V. 
 P. 
 cannot butknow that the freer a country is politically, the less the peas-antry shows even feeble socialist leanings. 
 And he simply plays on fragments of ideas expressed by European bourgeois professors and opportunists in order to confuse the issue, without even trying to set against Marxism anything at all like an integral, straightforward and clear social theory. 
 That is why nothing could be more boring than Mr. 
 A. 
 V. 
 P. 
’s article. 
 And nothing could be more indicative ofthe total ideological death of Narodnik socialism in Russia. 
 It is dead. 
 You can find Mr. 
 A. 
 V. 
 P. 
’s “ideas” in full inany bourgeois social-reformist publication in the West, sothere is no point in refuting them. 
 But while Narodnik socialism is dead in Russia, having been killed by the revolution of 1905 and buried by peoplelike A. 
 V. 
 P. 
, and while nothing is left of it but rottenphrases, Russia’s peasant democracy—a democracy that isby no means socialist but as bourgeois as was democracy inAmerica in the 1860s, in France at the close of the eight-eenth century, in Germany in the first half of the nineteenth century, etc. 
, etc. 
—is alive . 
 The honey-tongued priest’s story of the countryside, re-corded by Mr. 
 Kryukov, fully confirms this. 
 And let usnote in passing that what Kryukov reports perhaps standsout even more vividly and precisely from the observations which the Vekhi -minded Bulgakov, an admitted enemy of democracy, published in Russkaya Mysl (No. 
 11, 1912—“At the Elections”). 
 “Servility and cowardice have always been there!” says Kryu-kov’s little priest, speaking of the Russian clergy. 
 “But the differ-ence now is that there has never been so appallingly calm and tacit a falling-away from the church as today. 
 It is as if the spirit of lifewere dead in the church. 
 I repeat that it isn’t the intellectuals alonewho have left—so have the people .... 
 I m ust admit it—after all, I’ve been a country priest for two years. 
” The honey-tongued priest recalled the year 1905 . 
 At that time he was busy explaining the manifesto to the peas-ants. 
 “I had looked forward,” he wailed, “to understanding, close unity, love , sobriety, a sound mind, an awakening, vigour .... 
 But while understanding did seem to come, we had hatred and internecine strife instead of solidarity and unity. 
 And I was the very first manto be hit by the countryside, and pretty roughly, too. 
 Why, didn’tI stand for it heart and soul? I told them all about those libertiesand all that sort of thing. 
 And you should have seen how they lis-tened! I imagined you just couldn’t make things any clearer than I did, but no—there were other ideas that found their way into the countryside. 
 Besides, the new explainers made a much spicier stew— they talked about the land and equality and the landlords. 
 Of course , the muzhiks saw it and swallowed it at once . 
 First of all they came to tell me that they would pay me for tithes not two hundred rublesbut one hundred.... 
 “However, what vexed me particularly wasn’t that fact—about that hundred rubles—but the totality of the things which so unex-pectedly reshaped the countryside. 
 Didn’t they all try to open its eyes for it, to rid it of its ignorance, to lighten its darkness! And to tell the truth, they succeeded too. 
 A bit of light did dawn on theblind, and they have no longer been blind since then, even though they haven’t really recovered their eyesight. 
 But with that half-vision came only the most sorrowful knowledge and the most chokinghatred .... 
 Some day they may sigh regretfully thinking of their past ignorance. 
 There’s so much hatred in the countryside that you’d say the very air is saturated with it nowadays .... 
 T hey are quick with the knife and the cudgel and the fire-brand. 
 There’s a feeling of helplessness, the sting of unavenged grievances, internecine quar-rels, indiscriminate hatred, envy of all who are better off, who livemore comfortably and own more. 
 To be sure, there was envy and hatred and sorrow and vile sin in the past as well, but people had faith in the divine will and realised the futility of worldly benefits. 
They had faith and were therefore able to bear it , hoping to be rewarded in the hereafter. 
 That faith is no more. 
 What people there believe in today is that we are oppressors and they are the oppressed. 
 Weedsand thornapples have sprouted in the countryside from all that talk about freedom .... 
 And now this new law about the land—brother has risen up against brother, son against father and neighbour againstneighbour! The hatred and discord now are such that the country-side will choke with it, it certainly will. 
” We have underlined certain particularly characteristic words in this characteristic description of the countryside by the mealy-mouthed little priest (a genuine Narodnikintellectual!). 
 The priest is a partisan of “love” and an enemy of “ha-tred”. 
 In this respect he fully shares the Tolstoyan (we mayalso say Christian), thoroughly reactionary point of view which our Cadets and Cadet-like people are constantly promoting. 
 Such a priest would hardly mind dreaming ofsome sort of “socialisation of the land” or prattling about the “socialist” significance of co-operation and about “standards of landownership”. 
 But when it came to hatredinstead of “love”, he at once recoiled, went limp and whimpered. 
 There is any amount of verbal, loud-mouthed “social-ism” (“popular and not proletarian”), and in Europe too any literate philistine approves of it. 
 But when it comes to “hatred” instead of “love”, that is the end. 
 Socialism as humane phrase-mongering—yes, we are for it; revolutionary democracy—no, we are against it. 
 What the honey-tongued little priest says on the hack-neyed subject of “hooliganism” in the countryside is abso-lutely nothing new from the factual point of view. 
 But itis evident from his own story that “hooliganism” is a con-cept introduced by the feudal landlords . 
 “Burning, unavenged grievances” is what the sugary priest notes. 
 And this, ofcourse, is a very far cry from “hooliganism”. 
 In the struggle against Narodism, Marxists have long regarded it as their task to smash Manilovism, cloying phrases, a sentimental supra-class point of view, and vulgar“popular” socialism worthy of a French “Radical Social-ist” skilled in shady business deals. 
 But, at the same time,Marxists have long considered it just as much their indis-pensable task to extract the democratic core of Narodnik views. 
 Narodnik socialism is a putrid and evil-smelling corpse. 
 Peasant democracy in Russia is a living force, ifKryukov’s honey-tongued priest has depicted it accurately. 
Indeed, it cannot help being a living force so long as thePurishkeviches are in the saddle, and so long as there aresome thirty million who are starving. 
 “Indiscriminate hatred”, we are told. 
 First of all, this is not the whole truth. 
 It is the Purishkeviches and govern-ment officials and amiable intellectuals who see no “dis-crimination”. 
 Secondly, even at the beginning of the work-ing-class movement in Russia there was a certain element of“indiscriminate hatred”, such as that, for instance, which took the form of destroying machinery during the strikes of the sixties, seventies and eighties of the last century. 
 Thatdid not last. 
 Nor was that the point. 
 It would be banal todemand that people in this situation who were losing theirpatience should use “kid gloves”. 
 The important thing is the far-reaching break with the old, hopelessly reactionary world outlook, the thorough assimilation of just that doctrine about the “enslaved”that is an earnest of real life and not of the sleep of death. 
 Narodnik socialism is rotten even in its most Left-wing section. 
 What is alive and vital is the task of purifying, en-lightening, arousing and unifying the democratic movement through a deliberate break with doctrines of “love”, “pa-tience”, and so on. 
 The honey-tongued little priest is sad. 
We, however, have every reason to rejoice in the ampleopportunities for vigorous work.

 AN INCREASING DISCREPANCY NOTES OF A PUBLICIST I Recently the Cadet deputies conferred again with local leaders of that party. 
 As might have been expected, they discussed the features of the present political situation. 
 The liberals appraised thesituation as follows: “Attention was drawn to the increasing discrepancy between the country’s requirements for basic legislation and the impossibility of meeting them under the present system of legislative institutions and in view of the present attitude of the authorities towards popularrepresentation. 
” The style is as tangled as a ball of wool with which a kitten has been playing for a long time. 
 Our poor liberals—they have nowhere to express their ideas clearly! But take a closer look: the trouble is not so much that the liberals have nowhere to talk as that they have nothing t o say. 
 The discrepancy is growing not only between the coun-try’s requirements and the hopelessness of the “present system”, etc. 
, but also between the country’s requirementsand the liberals’ helplessness . 
 Why is it impossible for you, liberal politicians, to meet the requirements of the country? The Cadets reply: becausethe present system of legislative institutions and the present attitude of the authorities towards popular representation hinder it. 
 Consequently, we need a different system and a differ-ent attitude of the authorities. 
 We shall see in what way they must be different when we analyse in subsequent arti-cles the “four theses” of the Cadet meeting. 
 But we must first put the main question: What is the reason for the “present” “system and attitude”? Where couldanything different come from? The Cadets did not even think of it! Their reticence on this fundamental question amounts to hardened, Asiatic philistinism, like saying that therewere bad advisers but there can be good advisers. 
 Is there no connection, Cadet gentlemen, between the “present” and the interests of some class , such as the class of the big landlords? Or the richest section of the bourgeoisie?Is not there complete accord between the “present” and the interests of definite classes ? Is it not clear that any one who sets about discussing the political situation without taking into account the relations between all the classes engages in useless talk? Alas! The Cadets have nothing but empty talk to cover up the “increasing discrepancy” between their policy andthe requirements of the country. 
 II Our liberals in general—and they are followed by the liberal labour politicians (liquidators)—like to talk at length about the “Europeanisation” of Russia. 
 A tiny littletruth serves here as a cover for a big untruth. 
 There can be no doubt that Russia, speaking generally, is becoming Europeanised, i. 
e. 
, reorganised in the image ofEurope (moreover, in “Europe” we should now include Japan and China, in spite of geography). 
 But this European-isation has been going on since Alexander II, or perhapseven since Peter the Great; it went on not only during theupswing (1905), but also during reaction (1908-11); it has been going on in the police and among the Markov-typelandlords, who are “Europeanising” their methods of fight-ing the democratic movement. 
 The catchword “Europeanisation” turns out to be so gen-eral that it serves to obscure matters, to obscure urgentpolitical issues. 
 The liberals want a Europeanised Russia. 
 But the Council of the United Nobility, too, sought Europeanisation by its law of November 9, 1906 (June 14, 1910). 
 The liberals want a European constitution. 
 But the con-stitutions established in various countries of Europe werethe result of long and strenuous class struggles between feu-dalism and absolutism, on the one hand, and the bourgeoi-sie, the peasantry and the workers, on the other. 
 Written and unwritten constitutions, with which the liberals “shame” our reactionaries, are merely a record of the results of struggle obtained through a series of hard-won victories ofthe new over the old and a series of defeats inflicted on thenew by the old. 
 The liberals want the results to make their appearance in our country without the sum total of advantages and disadvantages of which the results consist! The liberalprogramme and liberal tactics amount to this: let a Euro-pean way of life take shape in our country without the hard struggle which brought it into being in Europe! It is understandable that our Kobylinskys greet the liberals’ wishes and arguments with contemptuous sallies against “shopkeepers” and “muzhiks”. 
 “You want, liberalgentlemen,” say the Kobylinskys, “to register on paper vic-tories that you have not yet won in reality. 
” III The Cadet meeting approved four theses on tactics. 
 The first reads: “The tactic of united action by the entire opposition front, while being a necessary condition for the execution of the Duma’s currentbusiness, does not, however, guarantee either the securing of a solidand lasting majority in the Duma for the Bills of the opposition orthe actual realisation of the Bills whose adoption in the Duma theopposition could secure, with the aid of the Duma Centre. 
” Translated into plain Russian, this gibberish means the following: It is only with the Octobrists that the liberals can form a majority in the Duma. 
 Such a majority is not perma-nent and its decisions are not put into effect. 
 Quite so. 
 But this leads to the conclusion that to call those decisions “necessary”, “current” and “business” (!??) is to deceive oneself and the people. 
 In defeating the Rights by voting with the Octobrists, we must not adopt the standpoint of legislating in theFourth Duma, must not sow constitutional illusions—thatis what the Cadets should have said to the people had theywanted to be democrats, not in words alone. 
 The first “thesis” of the Cadet meeting is strikingly illog-ical. 
 It describes as “business” the approval by an incon-stant and unstable majority in the Fourth Duma of Billsthat are not put into effect!! The Cadets themselves haveon a hundred occasions described this as “vermicelli” and anuisance, and justly so. 
 But the Cadet tactics, extremely stupid from the stand-point of logic, become comprehensible from the standpointof class interests. 
 Let us recall what the Social-Democratshave been saying in the Third and Fourth Dumas ever since1907. 
 “There are two possible majorities in the Duma,”they said, “a Right-wing and Octobrist and an Octobrist-Cadet one. 
 Both take a counter-revolutionary stand” (cf. 
 Prosveshcheniye , 1913, No. 
 1, p. 
 13). 
 * The Cadets’ February 1913 meeting confirmed what we had been saying in our official decisions since 1907. 
 “The tactic of united action by the entire opposition front ... with the aid of the Duma Centre” is indispensable to the Cadets precisely because, like the Octobrists, they take a counter-revolutionary stand. 
 In view of the inner kinshipof the Cadets and Octobrists, it is understandable that theygravitate towards joint ‘business’, despite-its hopelessnesstoday. 
 The Octobrists are always whimpering in their press, railing at the revolution, railing at the government, the Rights and the Council of State, but in the Duma they con-fine themselves to a desire for reforms and follow thegovernment. 
 The Cadets whimper even more in their press, railing at the revolution, railing at the government, the Rights, the *See pp. 
 496-97 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 Council of State and the Octobrists, but in the Duma they confine themselves to a desire for reforms and try to adapt their opposition to the Octobrists. 
 IV The second thesis of the Cadet meeting reads: “The Duma can be substantially strengthened as a legislative and political factor only by fulfilling three fundamental conditions: democratisation of the electoral law (universal suffrage), a radicalreform of the Council of State, and a responsible Ministry. 
” The gist of the tactics set out here may be expressed by one word: reformism. 
 Historical science tells us that the distinction between a reformist and a non-reformist change in a given politicalform is, generally speaking, that in the former case the oldruling class retains power, while in the latter case power istransferred from the old class to a new one. 
 The Cadets donot understand the class basis of historical changes. 
 This is their basic error from the point of view of theory. 
 From the point of view of practice, the above theoretical distinction depends on whether the particular is changedwhile the general and basic is left unchanged, or whether itis the latter that is changed. 
 In different countries and in different periods of history, the bourgeoisie has been reformist or has gone further than that. 
 On the other hand, the working class, which has neverconsidered reforms capable of bringing about radical changes,under certain conditions by no means refrains from advanc-ing immediate demands in the shape of reforms. 
 The point is, consequently, that the Cadets regard the retention of power by the present ruling class, i. 
e. 
, the big feudal-type landowners, as indisputable. 
 The Cadets persistin their standpoint of an opposition in the possessive case,continuing to hold the view that “there is a constitutionin Russia, thank God”. 
 In other words, the Cadets’ “three basic conditions” are those proposed by the liberal bourgeoisie for an amicable division of economic and political privileges between thefeudal landowners and the capitalists. 
 The Octobrists have the same standpoint (“reconciliation of the government and the country”, as phrased by Makla-kov, who is half Octobrist and half Cadet), except that the Octobrists propose conditions for division that are more“subservient ” with regard to the landowners. 
 The big subservience of the Octobrists has proved a fiasco. 
 What reasons are there for expecting a different result fromthe little subservience of the Cadets? From the point of view of reformism, the Octobrists are much more consistent, for those who adopt this point of view must take into accountthe acceptability of reforms, and the Octobrist “reforms” are much more “acceptable”. 
 The only conclusion to be drawn is that the discrepancy between liberal reformism and the requirements of the country is growing. 
 V The third thesis of the Cadet meeting reads: “Preparing these conditions should become the main tactical task of the Constitutional-Democrats, and current legislative activ-ity, jointly with the other opposition groups and with the Centre, should be utilised as far as it proves feasible but should not run coun-ter to the realisation of these main tasks” ( Rech No. 
 34, February 4). 
 The previous “thesis” was a concession to the Left Cadets, or rather a bait for the democrats, as if to say: support usCadets, for we are “democrats” and are for universal suffrage! After the nod to the left comes a serious turn to the right; the third thesis, translated from gibberish into plain Rus-sian reads: we Cadets recognise joint current legislative activity with the Progressists and Octobrists ! But does not this “current” legislation produce unreal-isable Bills, as the first thesis admits? The Cadets make a little reservation: “as far as feasible”. 
 Speaking more plain-ly, this is equivalent to saying: we shall busy ourselves withvermicelli, but the responsibility for it falls on the Octo-brists! Really, they are good jokers, are our Cadets. 
 To proceed. 
 Neither the Progressists, nor the Octobrists, who are more consistent than the Cadets in their adherence to the reformist point of view, agree to such “excessively” liberal demands as universal suffrage, radical reform of the Council of State, etc. 
 That being so, how can the Cadets, who continue to pose as democrats, proclaimjoint current legislative activity with these admitted op-ponents of democracy? Here, too, the Cadets have a little reservation—to the effect that they, the Cadets, are busy preparing for univer-sal suffrage, preparing , jointly with the Octobrists, for activity that “should not run counter to the realisation”of universal suffrage! It is a simple loophole—they declare Rodzyanko’s speech to be “constitutional”, and they vote (not by mistake, as dothe Social-Democrats, but by conviction) for the Octobrist formula of procedure with regard to the declaration of the Minister, for all this does not run counter to “preparing” for universal suffrage!! Here we cannot say that the Cadets are good jokers. 
 In this case we should have to use a different word. 
 In all European countries, the counter-revolutionary liberal bourgeoisie, which has turned its back on the demo-cratic movement, continues to assert that it is busy pre-paring (jointly with the national-liberals in Prussia and with all the Progressists in France) for “basic” democraticreforms. 
 The bourgeoisie which has definitely taken the reform-ist path is a rotten bourgeoisie, impotent in its liberalism, hopeless in the matter of democratic changes, and hostileto the workers, a bourgeoisie which has deserted to the Rightsfrom the people. 
 VI The fourth, and last, thesis of the Cadet meeting reads: “This meeting considers it opportune, along with advancing the three slogans mentioned above, to raise the question of adopting more active tactical measures of parliamentary struggle. 
” Only parliamentary? And only “to raise the question”? Just what is meant by “more active tactical measures of parliamentary struggle”, Allah alone knows. 
 One might think the Cadet meeting had deliberately formulated its theses in the most incoherent terms. 
 In speaking of more active measures, the Cadets clearly want to show that they are moving to the left. 
 But it isnothing more than a show , for nothing definite can be read into it. 
 What are the kind of “measures” of parliamentary strug-gle that can, generally speaking, be called more active? Refusal to vote for the Octobrist and Progressist formulas of procedure. 
 Refusal to make speeches about “reconciliation of the government and the country”. 
 Refusal to be silent whenever a Right-wing and Octobrist majority puts through anti-democratic measures. 
 Refusal to agree to the closure or curtailment of general debates on matters of principle. 
 We advise anyone who comes into contact with the Cadets to make a point of asking them whether they have “raised”the question of more active measures, how they have decidedthis question since they are going to raise it, and how they actually adopt “more active measures”. 
 The country is moving to the left. 
 The new democratic movement is awakening to life. 
 The Cadets’ show of a slightswing to the left has a very definite political meaning,namely, to deceive this new democratic movement, toimpose its leadership upon it, to make themselves out to be its spokesmen. 
 The urgent task of the democrats is to prevent this deceit. 
 Anyone who has not drawn from the hard lessons of the pastthe conclusion that even partial leadership of the democraticelements by the Cadets inevitably results in vacillation, be-trayals, and inglorious defeats without struggle, has learned nothing. 
 He should be regarded as an enemy of democracy. 
 VII Taken as a whole, the Cadet meeting was an interesting document of the political activity of our “Centre”. 
 Normally the press in our country pays little attention to such docu-ments, to the precise and formal decisions of organised parties. 
 It has a distaste for “resolutions”. 
 It prefers inter-views and gossip. 
 But those who take a serious view of politics must care-fully analyse party decisions, and Marxists will do all intheir power to make such an analysis. 
 We have described the Cadets as the “Centre”. 
 It is cus-tomary , however, to apply this term to the Octobrists, who stand midway between the Rights and the opposition. 
 However, both from the point of view of the class basis of the political parties and from that of the nature of con-temporary politics in general, we must not limit ourselves to the Duma in analysing the parties, must not consider theOctobrists alone to be the “Centre”. 
 Look at the class basis of our parties—the Rights and nationalists, in general, are semi-feudal landlords. 
 They stand for the preservation and “aggravation” of the present regime. 
 Among the Octobrists, Progressists and Cadets, we see landlords of an undoubtedly more bourgeois type, and thenthe bulk of the big bourgeoisie. 
 All these parties want re-forms . 
 They all form a real centre between the semi-feudal landlords and the democrats (peasants and workers). 
 The bourgeoisie is more afraid of democracy than of reaction; this applies both to the Progressists and to theCadets. 
 The oppositional nature of these two parties has,of course, to be taken into account in the practical tasks of everyday politics, but this oppositional nature should not make us close our eyes to the class kinship of these par-ties and the Octobrists. 
 The semi-feudal landlords rule both by themselves and in a bloc with the upper ranks of the bourgeoisie. 
 The feudallandlords are against reforms. 
 The bourgeoisie in general is in favour of reforms, and it confines itself to a reformist stand, which is more than we can say of the peasant, letalone of the worker, democrats. 
 The Cadet meeting clearly showed us the Cadets’ reform-ism as their exclusive tactics. 
 The most important thing is to see the connection between these tactics and the class interests of the bourgeoisie, and the inadequacy of these tactics, the “increasing discrepancy” between them and therequirements of the country. 
 The most important thing is to see the fundamental kinship of the Cadets and the Octo-brists, and the absolute impossibility of any democratic successes whatever under Cadet leadership. 
 VIII This article was finished when I received Golos Moskvy No. 
 30, with an editorial under the heading “What Next?”, devoted to the Cadet meeting. 
 Taken in conjunction with the Duma votings on February 6 (adoption of the formula of procedure with regard to Kasso’sexplanation 209), that editorial is so important and sheds so vivid a light on the Cadets’ attitude to the Octobriststhat it is absolutely necessary to comment on those votings. 
 The official Octobrist organ, Golos Moskvy , represents the Cadet meeting (for some reason the paper calls it a “con-ference”) as a victory of the Left Cadets, headed by Milyu-kov, over the Right Cadets. 
 “Legislative activity,” said Golos Moskvy , expounding the Cadet resolution, “can be utilised only insofar as it does not run counterto these main tasks [i. 
e. 
, universal suffrage, a reform of the Councilof State, and a responsible Ministry]. 
 “To put it more simply, the adoption of this formula is tantamount to renouncing all legislative work within the bounds of what can actually be accomplished, and the Cadet opposition is henceforward assuming a frankly irresponsible character. 
 ” Golos Moskvy infers that there is nothing for it but to dissolve the Duma, for the Octobrists will never adopt theCadets’ attitude, which is so “uncompromising” (don’tlaugh!), there is no majority in the Duma, things are “utterlyhopeless”.... 
 See how history is written! That brings out remarkably well the profound kinship of the Cadets and the Octobrists, and the true nature of their“quarrel”: a lovers’ quarrel. 
 On February 6, in Moscow, the official Octobrist organ announced, as we have seen, the complete break-up of theOctobrist-Cadet bloc following the Cadet meeting, which took place before February 4 (when Rech reported the meeting). 
 On the very same day , February 6, the Octobrists and Cadets in the Fourth Duma, in St. 
 Petersburg, together /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR adopted by 173 votes to 153 the Octobrist-Cadet formula of procedure with regard to Kasso’s explanation, a formula subsequently rejected by chance when a confirmatory vote was taken!! That’s good, isn’t it?We have here a classical example of how the Octobrists and the Cadets fix their political “affairs”. 
 They have noth-ing to do with any “bloc”, God forbid! But they distribute the roles among themselves—to fool the public—so “skil-fully” that no formal bloc could provide them with any-thing so “convenient”. 
 The Cadets see that the country ismoving to the left, that a new democratic movement is aris-ing, and so they play at leftism by putting in circulation,through their meeting, several phrases which say absolutely nothing and are completely meaningless, but which sound like Left phrases. 
 The Octobrists support this feeling or impression among the public that the Cadets have goneleft; they bolster it up by officially declaring, in the Golos Moskvy editorial, that the Cadets’ attitude is uncompromis-ing and that it is impossible to form a majority in the Duma by an alliance of the Octobrists and Cadets; they fulminate against the Cadets for their leftism, clamour for the dissolu-tion of the Duma, and so on and so forth. 
 But in reality under cover of this clamour they haggled with the Cadets, and at the very time when they were makingtheir sharpest attack on the Cadets’ leftism they struck a bargain with them on a common formula!! “The wolves had their fill and the sheep kept their skins. 
” The democrats were hoodwinked, they were deceived anddecoyed into the Cadet fold (the Cadets are so Left-wing—see how the Octobrists rail at them for their leftism!), andthe Octobrist-Cadet bloc in the Black-Hundred Duma was preserved, strengthened and expanded. 
 One feels very much like exclaiming: O God, when will the Russian democrats see through this simple stratagemof liberal Cadet bamboozling! For liberal bourgeois politi-cians in all European countries use, in one form or another,the very same trick: when facing the people, they shout and swear in their official election speeches that they are democrats and radicals (the German “freethinkers”, LloydGeorge and Co. 
 in Britain), and even socialists (the Radical Socialists in France). 
 But in reality , in their actual policy, they make common cause with unquestionably anti-demo-cratic governments and parties, with the Octobrists of vari-ous shades and various nationalities. 
 How old this story is and how infinitely often the Cadets repeat it! IX Golos Moskvy asserts that prior to the elections the Cadets “carried on bitter polemics against the Lefts, trying to prove the need for legislative work within the bounds of the actual condi-tions. 
 It was this that warranted the hope that agreement could be reached between the Duma Centre and the opposition. 
 But after theelections the views of the leaders of the Cadet Party underwent animportant change. 
 The resolution on Duma tactics proposed byMilyukov and adopted by the conference is entirely at variance withall that was said during the elections—evidently to win the votes of the big urban bourgeoisie. 
 The latter would scarcely have agreed to back the Cadets on the platform which the conference has now putforward. 
” In this specimen of reasoning, you wonder which is the more astounding—its naïve cunning or naïve ignorance. 
 The views of the Cadets have not changed in the least . 
 The Cadets have always been, and remain, a liberal party leading the democratic movement by fraud. 
 At the 1912elections, too, they showed the big bourgeoisie their “true”face, their “solidarity” of smart dealers, their “sobriety” as servants of the capitalist class. 
 But at the same time, in front of the democratic voters, they took great pains tosuggest that they were democrats and that their Duma tacticsdid not differ in any essential from Social-Democratic tactics. 
 These two aspects of the Cadet policy are an indispens-able “adjunct of the attire” of every liberal party in any civilised country. 
 To be sure, individual party members often specialise, some in playing at democracy, others insobering up the “over-zealous” and pursuing a “respectable”bourgeois policy. 
 But then this is true of all countries. 
For example, Britain’s well-known liberal charlatan, LloydGeorge, poses in his speeches to the people as a regular revolutionary and all but a socialist, but in reality this Minister follows the policy of his leader, Asquith, who isno different from a Conservative. 
 The fact that the article in Golos Moskvy describes Mr. 
 Milyukov as a representative of the Left Cadets can only call forth a smile. 
 Mr. 
 Milyukov in fact represents official Cadet diplomacy, which is trying to reconcile the undemo-cratic nature of the party with democratic phrase-mongering. 
 Golos Moskvy said: “This new ‘post-election’ attitude of Mr. 
 Milyukov’s was approved by the conference anything but unanimously. 
 A considerable numberof participants insisted on the tactic of agreement with the Duma Centre for the purpose of securing the adoption of various Bills and cultural reforms. 
 The advocates of this point of view argued thatin discussing various Bills the group should compromise, trying to have them adopted in a liberal spirit, and by no means making them unacceptable. 
” There followed a sally against “the famous Cadetdiscipline” and “unquestioning submission” of the Cadets to Mr. 
 Milyukov’s “autocratic will”. 
 The game is obvious. 
 It is transparent. 
 The Octobrists “tease ” the Right Cadets, whom they are trying to repre-sent as defeated and provoke to a more determined struggleagainst the Left Cadets. 
 But this Octobrist game (whichwould have been impossible had the Cadets and Octobristsnot been members of one and the same little family) doesnot eliminate the indisputable fact that there are differ-ences of shade between the Left and the Right Cadets, between the Lloyd Georges and the Asquiths of our liberalism. 
 Look at Russkaya Molva . 
 This Progressist organ, which advocates a compromise between the Octobrists and theCadets, is attracting an increasing number of official mem-bers of the Cadet Party. 
 Mansyrev and Maklakov and Obolensky and Gredeskul and Alexandrov proved to be contributors—not all at once, but gradually, following theVekhi leader, Struve. 
 It is beyond doubt that these people urged closer links with the Octobrists. 
 Nor could it havebeen otherwise. 
 But it is just as doubtless that Milyukov istrying to reconcile them with the “Left Cadets” on a platform with a democratic facade and an Octobrist essence. 
 X The various parties’ Duma formulas of procedure with re-gard to Kasso’s explanation are very interesting. 
 They sup-ply us with accurate material for political analysis, mate-rial officially confirmed by the deputies of the various parties. 
 It is analysis that this material usually lacks most of all. 
 It gets lost amid the comments of the daily press or in the pile of the Duma’s verbatim reports. 
 Yet it is wellworth dwelling on if we want to understand the true nature of the various parties. 
 A leading article in Rech declared on the day following the adoption of the formula of no-confidence: “Thus Russiansociety has obtained from the Duma what it was entitled to expect” (No. 
 37, February 7). 
 This sounds as though all that “society” had to know was whether the Duma trustsMr. 
 Kasso! That is not true. 
 The people and the democrats have to know the motives of no-confidence so as to understand t he causes of a development considered abnormal in politics, and be able to find a way out to the normal. 
 Unity of the Cadets, Octobrists and Social-Democrats on just the phrase “we have no confidence” is too little as far as these veryserious issues are concerned. 
 Here is the Octobrists’ formula of procedure: “The Duma ... considers: (1) all involvement of secondary school pupils in political struggles is ruinous to the spiritual developmentof Russia’s young forces and harmful to the normal course of the lifeof society; (2) it is necessary, whenever the authorities are informedin good time of undesirable developments in secondary schools,to take preventive measures and not to wait until developmentsassume an abnormal character *; (3) emphatically declares against the application to pupils of police measures, such as were adoptedon December 10, 1912, without the knowledge of the school authori-ties, instead of natural educational influence; (4) considers anti-educational the slowness with which the fate of pupils removed fromschools is decided on, and expecting this incident to be dealt withimmediately in a sense benevolent to the pupils, proceeds to the nextbusiness. 
” What are the political ideas of this vote? *This text was introduced at the January 25 sitting. 
 At the sit-ting of February 1, Clause 2 was edited as follows: “It is noted withreference to this particular case that a formal and indifferent attitudeto pupils prevails in secondary schools, that teaching staffs are estranged from the families, and that it is necessary to establish a general benevolent view on the rising generation. 
” Politics are harmful at school. 
 The pupils are to blame. 
 But it is their teachers who should punish them and not the police. 
 We are dissatisfied with the government for its lack of “benevolence” and its slowness. 
 These are anti-democratic ideas. 
 This is liberal oppo-sition, for it implies: let the old system of authority remain, but it should be applied more mildly. 
 You may flog, but within reason, and without publicity. 
 Look at the Progressist formula of procedure: “The Duma finds that (1) the Ministry of Education, being in-formed of what had lately taken place in the secondary schools ofSt. 
 Petersburg, adopted an impassive attitude to its duties and failedto protect the secondary schools against incursion by the police; (2) the methods used by police officers, methods which were resorted to without protest on the part of the Ministry of Education and con-sisted in searching the schools, seizing children and holding themunder arrest at police-stations, and in applying impermissible meth-ods of investigation, were utterly unjustifiable, all the more sincein this case it was a matter not of safeguarding state security, but of restoring order in the secondary schools; (3) the whole set of meas-ures adopted by the Ministry of Education, measures directed to-wards estranging the school from the family, creates, through itscallous formalism which hampers the moral and intellectual growthof the young generation, conditions favourable to developments thatare abnormal in school life. 
 The Duma considers the explanation offered by the Minister of Education to be unsatisfactory and proceeds to the next business. 
” This formula was introduced on January 30, and the Progressists declared there and then that they would vote forthe Octobrists provided the latter added no-confidence. 
 Wehave seen above the results of this haggling. 
 On what basis could that haggling take place? On the basis of agreement in the main. 
 The Progressists, too, consider politics in the schools abnormal and they, too, call for “restoring order” (feudalorder). 
 They, too, are in opposition in the possessive case—opposition not to the old system of authority but to its ap-plication—“impassive, callous”, and so on. 
 In the 1860sPirogov agreed that there must be flogging, but he insisted on the flogging not being done impassively or callously. 
 The Progressists have no objection to the present socialelements “restoring order”, but they advise the latter to do it more “sympathetically”. 
 What progress has been made in our country in five decades! The Cadets’ formula of procedure: “Having heard the explanation offered by the Minister of Edu-cation and considering: (1) that it shows a complete confusion of theeducational point of view with that of the police; (2) that this expla-nation is a complete denial of the normal foundations on which rela-tions of friendly co-operation can be established between school andfamily; (3) that the policy of the Ministry, by giving rise to deep resentment among the pupils and to legitimate annoyance in society, itself promotes the creation of an atmosphere making for the early involvement of school youth in Political pursuits and hence itselfcreates conditions which it should prevent from arising; (4) that treating pupils as being guilty of crimes against the state cripples the lives of the most gifted among the rising generation, snatchesnumerous victims from its ranks and constitutes a threat to the fu-ture of Russia, the Duma considers the explanation offered by theMinister to be unsatisfactory and proceeds to the next business. 
” Here, too, “early” involvement in politics is condemned but in much milder terms and in a form veiled by phrases. 
This is an anti-democratic point of view. 
 Octobrists andCadets alike condemn police measures only because theywant prevention instead. 
 The system should prevent meet-ings, not disperse them. 
 Obviously, such a reform would only embellish the system but not change it. 
 “We are dis-satisfied with the policy of the Ministry,” say the Cadets,and from what they say it follows, exactly as with the Octo-brists, that it is possible to wish for a change in this policy without something much more radical. 
 The Cadets pronounce themselves against the govern-ment much more sharply than the Octobrists, and because of the sharp language politically immature elements overlookthe complete identity of the liberal, anti-democratic, pres-entation of the issue by the Cadets and the Octobrists. 
 The Duma should earnestly teach the people politics. 
 Those who learn their politics from the Cadets are corrupt-ing and not developing their political consciousness. 
 It is not an accident that the Octobrists, Progressists and Cadets haggled and struck a bargain on a common for-mula; it is a result of their ideological and political solidar-ity in the main. 
 Nothing could be more paltry than the policyof the Cadets, who agree to a direct condemnation of politics in the schools for the sake of finding the explana-tion offered unsatisfactory. 
 But the Cadets agreed to this because they themselves condemn “early” involvement. 
 The formula of the Trudovik group: “Whereas: (1) the brute force used on December 9, 1912, against secondary school pupils, which shocked society by the disgracefulparticipation of the secret police in educational supervision overpupils of secondary schools, was fully approved in the explanation offered by Mr. 
 Kasso, the Minister of Education, who sneered mali-ciously at public opinion; (2) the system of secret police and spying,which is a result of the entire policy of the combined Ministry, andin particular of Kasso, the Minister of Education, leads to completehavoc, and threatens in the future to cause a severe shock to the ris-ing generation, the Duma insists that all those discharged on Decem-ber 9 should be immediately reinstated and, considering the explana-tion offered by Kasso, the Minister of Education, to be unsatisfac-tory, demands his immediate resignation, and proceeds to the nextbusiness. 
” This formula is, strictly speaking, a markedly liberal one; but it does not contain what a democrat, as distinct from a liberal, should have said. 
 A liberal, too, may findit disgraceful to enlist the assistance of the secret policein educational supervision, but a democrat should say (and teach the people) that no “supervisors” have a right to en-croach on the free organisation of political circles and talks. 
A liberal, too, may condemn “the entire policy of the com-bined Ministry”, but a democrat in Russia should makeclear that there are certain general conditions by virtue ofwhich any other Ministry would have had to pursue practi-cally the same policy. 
 The democracy of the Trudovik formula shows only i n its tenor, in the sentiment of its authors. 
 There is no denyingthat sentiment is a political symptom. 
 But it would not beamiss to insist that the formula of procedure should containa well-thought-out idea and not merely “heart-warming” sentiment. 
 The Social-Democrats’ formula of procedure: “Having heard the explanation offered by the Minister of Edu-cation and considering that it indicates: (1) a determination to com-bat the natural and encouraging desire of school youth to extendtheir mental horizons through self-education and to hold comradelyintercourse; 2) a justification of the system of official formalism,spying and police investigation that is being implanted in the higher, secondary and elementary schools, a system which cripples youth mentally and morally, ruthlessly stamps out all signs of independenceof thought and character, and results in an epidemic of suicides amongpupils, the Duma considers the explanation unsatisfactory. 
 Consid-ering, at the same time, that (1) there is an inseparable connection between the domination of the police standpoint in the matter ofpublic education and the domination of the secret police over thewhole of Russian life, the suppression of all forms of organised andindependent activity by the citizens, and the latter’s lack of rights,and that (2) only a radical change in the political organisation and the system of state administration can free the citizens from police fetters and also free the school from them, the Duma proceeds to thenext business. 
” This formula, too, can hardly be considered impeccable. 
 One cannot help wishing it had presented the matter inmore popular language and in greater detail, and regrettingthat it does not stress the legitimacy of engaging in politics,and so on and so forth. 
 However, our criticism of all the formulas is by no means aimed at details of formulation, but exclusively at thefundamental political ideas of their authors. 
 A democrat should have said the important thing, namely, that polit-ical circles and talks are natural and to be welcomed . 
 That is the point. 
 All condemnation of involvement in politics, even if only of “early” involvement, is hypocrisy and obscurantism. 
 A democrat should have raised the level of thequestion from the “combined Ministry” to the political system. 
 He should have pointed out the “inseparable con-nection”, firstly, with the “domination of the secret police”and, secondly, with the domination of the class of big land-lords of the feudal type in the economic sphere.

 Ilyin SOME RESULTS OF THE “LAND ” POLICY What are the results of the new agrarian policy? All workers take an interest—a very legitimate one—in this question. 
 Government statistics are kept so poorly andare so biassed that they are not to be trusted. 
 The new landpolicy is no doubt a bourgeois policy, but it is wholly man-aged by the Purishkeviches, Markovs and Co. 
, i. 
e. 
, feudallandlords of the old type. 
 One could hardly expect anything but failure from this kind of “management”. 
 We wish to note the conclusions drawn by Mr. 
 V. 
 Obolen-sky in the latest issue (No. 
 2, 1913) of Russkaya Mysl . 
 This is a Black-Hundred and Cadet periodical. 
 The author ofthe article, too, is a counter-revolutionary, which meansthat he is a witness partial to the landlords rather than to anyone else. 
 He has discovered in Samara Gubernia an uyezd (Novouzensk) which has made “tremendous” progress in“land distribution”, more than fifty per cent of the house-holders having been allotted land in one piece. 
 Nevertheless, the conclusion which the author had t o draw was this: “As regards the immediate results of the new agrarian reform ... they can hardly be considered encouraging at all .... 
 A considerable amount of allotment land has passed for a song from peasant semi-proletarians to well-to-do peasants and speculating buyers-up .... 
 Rents have increased .... 
 The difference in cultivability between inte-gral farms and communal strip holdings is quite negligible .... 
 The new law ... has helped to aggravate the contradictions betweenthe conditions of economic activity and its inner content .... 
 P erhaps the minds of the peasants are now working harder than they did at the height of the recent revolution. 
” It is no use at all asking the liberal of Russkaya Mysl which way the minds of the peasants are working. 
 It is not for nothing that he has left out altogether the question of feudal farming on the landed estates. 
 But it is worth giving some thought to the conclusions drawn by the liberal landlord. 
 All the contradictions havebecome sharper, exploitation has increased, rent has risen,and progress in farming is quite negligible . 
 Not “perhaps” but quite certainly the minds of the peasants are working.

 I. 
 to the Pravda text THE HISTORICAL DESTINY OF THE DOCTRINE OF KARL The chief thing in the doctrine of Marx is that it brings out the historic role of the proletariat as the builder of socialist society. 
 Has the course of events all over the worldconfirmed this doctrine since it was expounded by Marx? Marx first advanced it in 1844. 
 The Communist Manifesto of Marx and Engels, published in 1848, gave an integral andsystematic exposition of this doctrine, an exposition which has remained the best to this day. 
 Since then world history has clearly been divided into three main periods: (1) fromthe revolution of 1848 to the Paris Commune (1871);(2) from the Paris Commune to the Russian revolution(1905); (3) since the Russian revolution. 
 Let us see what has been the destiny of Marx’s doctrine in each of these periods. 
 I At the beginning of the first period Marx’s doctrine by no means dominated. 
 It was only one of the very numerous groups or trends of socialism. 
 The forms of socialism that did dominate were in the main akin to our Narodism: in-comprehension of the materialist basis of historical move-ment, inability to single out the role and significance ofeach class in capitalist society, concealment of the bourgeoisnature of democratic reforms under diverse, quasi-socialist phrases about the “people”, “justice”, “right”, and so on. 
 The revolution of 1848 struck a deadly blow at all these vociferous, motley and ostentatious forms of pre-Marxian socialism. 
 In all countries, the revolution revealed the var-ious classes of society in action . 
 The shooting of the workers by the republican bourgeoisie in Paris in the June days of 1848 finally revealed that the proletariat alone was socialist by nature. 
 The liberal bourgeoisie dreaded the independenceof this class a hundred times more than it did any kind ofreaction. 
 The craven liberals grovelled before reaction. 
 Thepeasantry were content with the abolition of the survivals of feudalism and joined the supporters of order, wavering but occasionally between workers ’ democracy and bourgeois liberalism . 
 All doctrines of non-class socialism and non-class politics proved to be sheer nonsense. 
 The Paris Commune (1871) completed this development of bourgeois changes; the republic, i. 
e. 
, the form of polit-ical organisation in which class relations appear in their most unconcealed form, owed its consolidation solely to theheroism of the proletariat. 
 In all the other European countries, a more tangled and less complete development led to the same result—a bour-geois society that had taken definite shape. 
 Towards the end of the first period (1848-71), a period of storms and revolu-tions, pre-Marxian socialism was dead . 
 Independent prole-tarian parties came into being: the First International (1864-72) and the German Social-Democratic Party. 
 II The second period (1872-1904) was distinguished from the first by its “peaceful” character, by the absence of revo-lutions. 
 The West had finished with bourgeois revolutions. 
The East had not yet risen to them. 
 The West entered a phase of “peaceful” preparations for the changes to come. 
 Socialist parties, basically proletar-ian, were formed everywhere, and learned to use bourgeoisparliamentarism and to found their own daily press, theireducational institutions, their trade unions and their co-operative societies. 
 Marx’s doctrine gained a complete vic-tory and began to spread . 
 The selection and mustering of the forces of the proletariat and its preparation for the comingbattles made slow but steady progress. 
 The dialectics of history were such that the theoretical victory of Marxism compelled its enemies to disguise them-selves as Marxists. 
 Liberalism, rotten within, tried to revive itself in the form of socialist opportunism . 
 They inter-preted the period of preparing the forces for great battles asrenunciation of these battles. 
 Improvement of the conditionsof the slaves to fight against wage slavery they took to meanthe sale by the slaves of their right to liberty for a few pence. 
 They cravenly preached “social peace” (i. 
e. 
, peace with the slave-owners), renunciation of the class struggle, etc. 
They had very many adherents among socialist members ofparliament, various officials of the working-class movement,and the “sympathising” intelligentsia. 
 III However, the opportunists had scarcely congratulated themselves on “social peace” and on the non-necessity ofstorms under “democracy” when a new source of great world storms opened up in Asia. 
 The Russian revolution was fol-lowed by revolutions in Turkey, Persia and China. 
 It isin this era of storms and their “repercussions” in Europethat we are now living. 
 No matter what the fate of thegreat Chinese republic, against which various “civilised”hyenas are now whetting their teeth, no power on earth can restore the old serfdom in Asia or wipe out the heroic democracy of the masses in the Asiatic and semi-Asiaticcountries. 
 Certain people who were inattentive to the conditions for preparing and developing the mass struggle were drivento despair and to anarchism by the lengthy delays in the decisive struggle against capitalism in Europe. 
 We can now see how short-sighted and faint-hearted this anarchistdespair is. 
 The fact that Asia, with its population of eight hundred million, has been drawn into the struggle for these sameEuropean ideals should inspire us with optimism and not despair. 
 The Asiatic revolutions have again shown us the spine-lessness and baseness of liberalism, the exceptional importance of the independence of the democratic masses, and the pronounced demarcation between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie of all kinds. 
 After the experience both of Europe and Asia, anyone who speaks of non-class politics and non-class socialism, ought simply to be put in a cage and exhibited alongside the Australian kangaroo or somethinglike that. 
 After Asia, Europe has also begun to stir, although not in the Asiatic way. 
 The “peaceful” period of 1872-1904 has passed, never to return. 
 The high cost of living and the tyr-anny of the trusts are leading to an unprecedented sharpen-ing of the economic struggle, which has set into movementeven the British workers who have been most corrupted byliberalism. 
 We see a political crisis brewing even in the most “diehard”, bourgeois-Junker country, Germany. 
 The fren-zied arming and the policy of imperialism are turning modernEurope into a “social peace” which is more like a gunpowderbarrel. 
 Meanwhile the decay of all the bourgeois parties and the maturing of the proletariat are making steady progress. 
 Since the appearance of Marxism, each of the three great periods of world history has brought Marxism new confirma-tion and new triumphs. 
 But a still greater triumph awaitsMarxism, as the doctrine of the proletariat, in the comingperiod of history.

 The last of ficial statistics of land distribution in European Russia were published by the Ministry of the Interior and date from 1905. 
 According to these statistics there were (in round num-bers) about 30,000 big landlords owning over 500 dessia-tines each, their total land amounting to about 70,000,000dessiatines. 
 Some 10,000,000 poor peasant households owned the same amount of land. 
 *Anniversary of the abolition of serfdom in Russia. 
— Tr. 
 It follows that on the average there are about 330 poor peasant families for each big landlord, each peasant family owning about 7 ( seven ) dessiatines, while each big landlord owns about 2,300 ( two thousand three hundred ) dessiatines. 
 To show this graphically, we have drawn the above diagram. 
 The large white rectangle in the middle stands for the estate of a big landlord. 
 The small squares around it repre-sent the small peasant holdings. 
 Altogether there are 324 squares, and the area of the white rectangle equals 320 squares.

 51, March 2, 1913 Published according to the Pravda text FALSE NOTES Mr. 
 Milyukov’s Duma speech on universal suffrage was of outstanding interest because he had to touch on a numberof subjects of prime importance to democrats. 
 Our press in general, including the liberal press, is becom-ing more and more addicted to the abominably unprin-cipled habit of disposing of Duma speeches by commentingon them in glowing (Mr. 
 Litovtsev in Rech ) or abusive terms, without ever analysing their ideological content! The workers do not believe in bourgeois political chican-ery. 
 They want to learn politics. 
 In response to this desire of theirs, we shall attempt an analysis of Mr. 
 Milyukov’sspeech. 
 “You,” said Mr. 
 Milyukov, addressing himself all the time t o the Octobrists, “are not linked with authority either by specificcommitments or even by gratitude”, for the elections, you say, were rigged against you. 
 Mr. 
 Milyukov, one of the most educated Cadets, a profes-sor, editor, etc. 
, put forward this argument in the mostearnest way, and even added: “Apparently there is no social stratum in Russia supporting the present government policy...” ( Rossiya No. 
 2236). 
 The falsity of this argument is glaring. 
 None other than Mr. 
 Milyukov himself went on to quote the Frenchman Chasles, who very justly says that the “ crux of the matter ” “is the agrarian question ”. 
 “To obtain a conservative Third Duma,” says Chasles, “the major-ity had to be shifted from the peasants to the landlords .... 
 The land-ed proprietors and the aristocracy of wealth can form a bloc of five-eighths of the votes [in the elections to the Duma under our electoral law] and the minority can literally be crushed: the peasants, themiddle classes and the town democrats are invited by the legislatorto look on at the elections and not make them, to attend but not participate in them. 
” The reactionary Chasles argues cleverly and correctly. 
 We thank Mr. 
 Milyukov for his interesting quotations whichdefeat Mr. 
 Milyukov’s phrase-mongering! In Russia there evidently is a social “stratum” (the class of landlords— feudal lords or feudal-minded landlords) which supportsthe policy of the government and is linked “ with author-ity” by the bonds of class interests. 
 As for being linked by “commitments” and “gratitude”, it is perfect nonsense. 
Remember that, learned Cadet! In our next article * we shall show how this learned Cadet circled—like a cat round hot milk—about the “ crux of the matter ” (i. 
e. 
, the agrarian question), which the reactionary Chasles correctly pointed out.

 “THE CRUX OF THE MATTER ” We have seen that Chasles, the French reactionary quoted by Mr. 
 Milyukov, correctly considers that the agrarian ques-tion is the “crux of the matter” confronting Russia. 
 * Mr. 
 Milyukov quoted a clever statement by a clever reactionary but he does not understand it at all! “Can the peasant whom you [i. 
e. 
, the Octobrists and the govern-ment, for it is to them that Mr. 
 Milyukov talks!] have brought into this body with your own hands be made dependent? After all, hespeaks of the land from this rostrum, and he says the same thing asthe independent peasant said in the First and Second Dumas. 
 Thereis no element in Russian life, gentlemen, more independent or more stable than the Russian peasant. 
” (Applause on the right and voices: “Hear, hear”. 
) Those handclaps must have come from the hypocritical Cadets alone, for everyone knows, firstly, that in the Thirdand Fourth Dumas the peasants have been saying not quite “the same thing” but something weaker than they saidin the First and Second Dumas; and secondly, there is inRussian life an element that is more independent and more stable. 
 Mr. 
 Milyukov himself was compelled to admit in his speech that it is the workers who have done “most” for political liberty in Russia. 
 Or can “independence” bemeasured with a different yardstick? But this is not the point. 
 The point is, can the interests of 130,000 landlords and of the mass of the peasantry be reconciled now ? Mr. 
 Milyukov “talked round and round” this question to evade an answer . 
 *See pp. 
 588-89 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 But Mr. 
 S. 
 Litovtsev, hired by Rech to praise P. 
 Milyu-kov, wrote that Milyukov’s speech had “dispelled the fog shrouding this sharp and debatable question. 
 To many people, universal suffrage is still a sort of bogey, the heightof revolutionism”. 
 There you have yet another specimen of phrase-mongering! Learn from the reactionary Chasles, liberal wind-bags! The crux of the matter lies in the agrarian question. 
 Canthe interests of 130,000 landlord families and 10,000,000peasant families be reconciled on this question now ? Yes or no? That is the “ crux ” of the matter as far as universal suffrage is concerned, Mr. 
 Milyukov, while you corrupt the political consciousness of the people by muddling up with phrases this main point, which is obvious to any intelligent person. 
 If your answer to the question is yes, I shall refute you by means of your own admission that the peasants in the Third and Fourth Dumas have been saying (if less emphatically) the “ same thing ” as they said in the First and Second Dumas. 
 If, however, your answer is no, then all your talk about the conciliatory, non-“ one-sided ” character of universal suffrage in the Russia of today falls to the ground. 
 And your learned references to Bismarck are sheer child-ishness, for Bismarck “granted” universal suffrage at a time when the bourgeois development of Germany had already reconciled the interests of the landlords and all the well-to-do peasants, and even a section of the middle peasants. 
 The shrewd reader may ask: does it not follow that uni-versal suffrage is impossible in Russia? No, we will answerthe shrewd reader, it only follows that a reformist point of view is impossible in Russia.

 to the Pravda text LIBERAL EMBELLISHMENT OF SERFDOM Mr. 
 Milyukov, a liberal historian, leader of the Cadet Party, wrote in a recent leading article in Rech : “Social inequality in Russia [serfdom] turned out to be more fragile and accidentally established than anywhere else in the civi-lised world. 
 It gave way without resistance [!!!] at the very firststroke of the pen. 
 Milyutin and Solovyov accomplished withoutdifficulty something the feasibility of which Count Stroganov predict-ed as long ago as the reign of Alexander I. 
” We are used to seeing all liberal and some Narodnik his-torians embellish serfdom and the serf-owning state powerin Russia. 
 But not all went to the length of such disgrace-ful “gems” as the one we have just quoted. 
 Serfdom and the serf-owning landlord class in Russia were not fragile and accidentally established but much “stronger”, more firm, powerful and omnipotent “than any-where else in the civilised world”. 
 It did not cede even asmall part of its privileges “without resistance”, but didit with the greatest resistance. 
 Or perhaps the liberalgentleman could point out in the “civilised world” examples comparable to the fate of Chernyshevsky? Milyutin and Solovyov themselves upheld the privileges of the feudal landlords and the exceedingly onerous “ com-pensation ” for these privileges. 
 By saying nothing about this, Mr. 
 Milyukov distorts history, which testifies to halfa century of “tenacious” feudal privileges, omnipotence and unlimited power after Milyutin and Co. 
, after “ their ” feu-dal reform. 
 Why do liberal historians embellish serfdom and feudal reforms? Because they see in the activity of the makers of such reforms a servility to the feudal lords that is gratify-ing to them, a fear of democracy that they find encouraging, a desire for a bloc with reaction that they appreciate, and an embellishment of the class struggle that is familiar to them. 
 The question relates to the distant past. 
 And yet the attitude to the class struggle adopted then and now by theliberals (liberals “without and bureaucrats within” 210) is a phenomenon of one and the same nature. 
 By embellishing serfdom, Mr. 
 Milyukov has splendidly portrayed his own self, his party and all Russian bourgeoisliberals, who class themselves among the democrats in orderto fool simpletons.

S. 
 capitalism is ahead of all. 
 The greatest development of technology and the most rapid progress are facts whichmake old Europe emulate the Yankees. 
 But it is not the democratic institutions that the European bourgeoisie is borrowing from America, nor political liberty, nor yet therepublican political system, but the latest methods of ex-ploiting the workers. 
 The most widely discussed topic today in Europe, and to some extent in Russia, is the “system” of the American engineer, Frederick Taylor. 
 Not so long ago Mr. 
 Semyonov read a paper on this system in the assembly hall of theRailway Engineering Institute in St. 
 Petersburg. 
 Taylorhimself has described his system under the title of “scien-tific”, and his book is being eagerly translated and promotedin Europe. 
 What is this “scientific system”? Its purpose is to squeeze out of the worker three times more labour during a workingday of the same length as before. 
 The sturdiest and mostskilful worker is put to work; a special clock registers—inseconds and fractions of a second—the amount of timespent on each operation and each motion; the most economi-cal and most efficient working methods are developed; the work of the best worker is recorded on cinematographicfilm, etc. 
 The result is that, within the same nine or ten working hours as before, they squeeze out of the worker three timesmore labour, mercilessly drain him of all his strength, and are three times faster in sucking out every drop of the wage slave’s nervous and physical energy. 
 And if he dies young?Well, there are many others waiting at the gate! In capitalist society, progress in science and technology means progress in the art of sweating. 
 Here is an example from Taylor’s book. 
 Speaking of the operation of loading cast iron on to hand-carts for further processing, the author compares the oldand the new, “scientific”, system: Old New system Number of workers engaged in loading ...... 500 140 Average number of tons loaded by one worker (a ton equals 61 poods) ............. 
. 
 16 59 Average earnings of workers (rubles) ....... 
 2. 
30 3. 
75 Expenditure incurred by factory owner per ton of load (kopeks) ............... 14. 
4 6. 
4 The capitalist cuts his expenditure by half or more. 
 His profits grow. 
 The bourgeoisie is delighted and cannot praisethe Taylors enough! The workers get a wage increase at first. 
 But hundreds of workers get the sack. 
 Those who are left have to work four times more intensively, doing a back-breaking job. 
 When he has been drained of all his strength, the workerwill be kicked out. 
 Only young and sturdy workers aretaken on. 
 It is sweating in strict accordance with all the precepts of science.

 to the Pravda text OUR “ACHIEVEMENTS ” The Minister of Finance, in his explanatory note on the Budget, and all the government parties assure themselvesand others that our Budget is firmly based. 
 They refer, among other things, to the “achievements” of industry, which indubitably has been on the upgrade in the last fewyears. 
 Our industry, as well as our entire national economy, has been developing along capitalist lines. 
 That is indis-putable, and needs no proof. 
 But anyone who limits himself to data on “development” and to the smugly boastful state-ment that “there is an increase of so-and-so many per cent”shuts his eyes to Russia’s incredible backwardness and pov-erty, which these data reveal. 
 The output of our entire factory industry was worth 4,307 million rubles in 1908 and about 4,895 million rubles in 1911, says the Minister of Finance exultantly. 
 But see what these figures mean . 
 In America a census is taken every ten years. 
 To come upon a figure similar t o ours, we must go back to 1860, when America still hadNegro slaves . 
 In 1860 the output of America’s manufacturing industry was valued at 3,771 million rubles, and in 1870 it was worth as much as 8,464 million rubles. 
 In 1910 its value wasalready as high as 41,344 million rubles, i. 
e. 
, almost nine times as much as in Russia. 
 Russia has a population of 160 million, while America had 92 million in 1910 and 31 mil-lion in 1860! In 1911 the Russian factory worker earned an annual average of 251 rubles, or 8. 
2 per cent more (in terms of thewages total) than in 1910, exults the Minister of Finance. 
 In America the average pay of the industrial worker in 1910 was 1,036 rubles , i. 
e. 
, more than four times that of his Russian counterpart. 
 In 1860 it was 576 rubles , i. 
e. 
, double the present amount in Russia. 
 Twentieth-century Russia, the Russia of the June Third “Constitution”, is in a lower position than slave-owning America . 
 In Russia, annual productivity per factory worker was 1,810 rubles in 1908, while in America it was 2,860 rubles in 1860 and 6,264 rubles in 1910. 
 These few figures suffice as a brief illustration of modern capitalism and of the medieval oppression of serfdom whichfetters it, and which accounts for the sorry plight of thebulk of the peasantry. 
 As a matter of fact, the plight of the peasantry is inevit-ably reducing the home market to miserable dimensionsand dragging down the worker, who in 1911 earned half theamount earned by the American worker in the period ofslavery. 
 Besides, the conditions of the world market con-front Russia with the alternative of either being crushed by competitors among whom capitalism is advancing at a different rate and on a truly broad basis, or of gettingrid of all the survivals of serfdom.

 to the Pravda text AGREEMENT OR SPLIT? CONCERNING THE DIFFERENCES WITHIN THE SOCIAL -DEMOCRATIC DUMA GROUP Social-Democratic opinion is alarmed by the threat of a split in the group that sounded in the letter of the sevendeputies. 
 The matter has justly aroused keen interest among the workers. 
 It is essential to make an accurate and clear-cut appraisal of the situation. 
 On one side are all six deputies from the worker curia, i. 
e. 
, representatives of the vast majority of Russia’s workingclass, as everyone realises. 
 On the other side are the remain-ing seven deputies, who command an accidental majority of one vote inside the group. 
 On the face of it, the point at issue is that the seven depu-ties want to force the other six to become contributors tothe newspaper Luch , and declare for merging Pravda and Luch . 
 These demands of the seven deputies seem to us sim-ply unreasonable, to put it plainly. 
 Can anyone be compelled “by a majority vote” to contribute to a newspaper whose trend he does not share? (It goes without saying that anyself-respecting editorial board would refuse to have “con-tributors” who have been dragged in by force, against theirwill. 
) Can one speak seriously of merging Pravda and Luch ? Of course not! And we declare plainly that we should consider it a betrayal of the proletarian cause for Pravda to renounce its struggle against liquidationism, and hence,for Pravda and Luch to be merged, so long as Luch has not renounced liquidationist propaganda —against the “under-ground ”, against political strikes , etc. 
 A serious Social-Democrat would hardly believe it if he were told that Prav-da and the six workers’ deputies had decided to commit suicide merely because Luch insisted on it. 
 That is out of the question, and the seven deputies will do well to cease harking back to their absolutely unacceptable and unreal-istic “plan”. 
 However, this does not exhaust the issue of the differ-ences within the group. 
 Everyone senses that behind theoutward dispute over the forced collaboration with Luch there is some other, more serious and important dispute. 
 Thepoint of this dispute is the attitude of either section of the group to liquidationism . 
 And we think that in this matter the workers are entitled first of all to insist on the seven deputies stating their atti-tude to liquidationism—in plain , precise , clear and definite terms . 
 It is the duty of the seven deputies to do this as open-ly as the six workers’ deputies did it. 
 In the Third Duma group, the overwhelming majority of the deputies were Mensheviks . 
 But their attitude to liquidationism was mark-edly negative . 
 Now what is the attitude of the seven depu-ties today? They have themselves raised the question ofLuch , i. 
e. 
, of liquidationism. 
 They are, therefore, doubly obliged to say openly and exactly what they think of the propaganda of Luch against the underground (see Luch No. 
 101 and other issues), against political strikes, against thehegemony of the working class in the emancipation move-ment, etc. 
 Unless this is done, not a single step can betaken towards finding a way out of the situation. 
 We say plainly: if the Social-Democratic group were found to include even one deputy who would make speeches from the Duma platform like the article in Luch No. 
 101 (which said that the growing sympathy for the “underground” was a“deplorable” fact, etc. 
), a break with that deputy would be unavoidable . 
 And any Social-Democratic deputy who did not get up and say that that speaker did not express the opinion of the Social-Democrats would fail in his duty towards the working class. 
 Are we right or wrong in expressing this opinion? We shall calmly leave it to the workers to answer this question. 
 In view of the serious differences between the two halves of the group, unity can be preserved only if both sides alike strive for agreement . 
 To “settle” questions bearing on the Party Programme by an accidental majority of one votemeans inviting a split . 
 That is obvious to anyone. 
 People who are earnest in their desire for unity will never adopt this way of “settling” questions. 
 Is such an agreement possible in the group as it now stands? Until recently it was. 
 The declaration of the group, read at the beginning of the Fourth Duma’s work, is anexample. 
 The group rejected liquidationist claims, and thusmade an agreement between the two sections possible. 
 Givengoodwill, and provided the seven deputies are not prepar-ing for a split, this will be possible in the future as well on all important political questions. 
 The declaration is an example of what should be done t o avoid a split. 
 On the other hand, the example of “culturalnational autonomy” is an example of what should not be done , to avoid a split. 
 To put forward this demand, as did Comrade Chkhenkeli, means cancelling the Social-Demo-cratic Programme. 
 Hitherto the liquidators have assertedthat this demand “does not contradict” the Programme,but now they have been exposed even by the Bundists them-selves, who (see Die Zeit No. 
 9 211) congratulate Chkhenkeli precisely for having “abandoned the rigid standpoint of official theory on the national question”. 
 To cancel the Programme by seven votes to six means paving the way for a split . 
 That is obvious to any class-conscious worker. 
 And so, the alternative is agreement or split ! What do we propose? Agreement ! Is agreement possible? Yes! Is it desirable? Yes! What is needed to bring it about? What is needed is not to cancel the programme, not to revile the “underground”,to remain loyal to the old banner! Our demands are modest,as the reader will see. 
 For agreement between the seven and six, against a split! This is what all class-conscious workers should demand.

 to the Pravda text “SPAR E CAS H”212 The government newspapers, headed by the sycophantic Novoye Vremya , are extolling our government for the splendid results achieved by the national economy. 
 Just think: 450 million rubles of “spare cash”! Bringing money intothe house and not taking it out—that, please note, is how “we” manage our household. 
 And Novoye Vremya , newspaper of the Black-Hundred landlords and Octobrist merchants, comes to the conclusion that there is no risk at all even in waging war when youhave such a nest-egg as 450 million rubles. 
 Let us, however, look at the explanatory note of the Min-ister of Finance to the Budget for 1913. 
 Perhaps we canfind in it, besides self-praise (of which the note is chock-full!), exact data on the origin of the vaunted “spare cash”? We open the Minister’s explanatory note and read (Part I, p. 
 15) that in the five years from 1908 to 1912 loans brought the Treasury 339,500,000 rubles. 
 During the same period, loans were paid off to the value of 252,100,000 rubles. 
 Hence loans have increased by a total of 87,400,000 rubles . 
 There you have the first “source” of the “spare cash”. 
 It is a simple one, as you see. 
 But to proceed. 
 It is known that on October 1 , 1908 , the price of state-monopoly vodka was raised to the limit, that is, from 8 rubles to 8. 
40 per vedro * (meaning the stand-ard vedro, for the price per table vedro went up from 11 to 12 rubles). 
 As a result of this “financial measure”, the prices of state-monopoly vodka in the five-year period 1908-12 averaged8. 
48 rubles per vedro, i. 
e. 
, exactly 42 kopeks more than in the previous four years (in 1904-07 it was 8. 
06 per vedro). 
 *Twenty-one pints— Tr. 
 Altogether the Treasury sold 440,500,000 vedros of 40% vodka in five years (1908-12). 
 The 42-kopek increase in profit per vedro added up to 185 million rubles . 
 There you have the second source of the “spare cash”!The third source—the state railways—yielded in four years (1908-11) 53 million rubles of “net profit”, if one leaves out of account payment of interest and amortisation of Treas-ury capital expenditure, which totalled 2,250 million rubles!! Let us assume that in 1912 this “profit” was as high as in 1911, i. 
e. 
, 105 million rubles. 
 We get a “profit” of 158 million rubles during the five years. 
 Obviously, a national “economy” in which interest and amortisation on thousandsof millions spent are not taken into account is more likenational juggling. 
 Let us note that it was not some “Left-wing journalist” (God forbid!) but the State Control itself that estimated at 397,600,000 rubles in four years (1908-11) the interest and amortisation on the investments made bythe Treasury in the railway system. 
 In terms of the fiveyears from 1908 to 1912, it adds up to 500 million rubbles ! This is a specimen of predatory economy . 
 We shall now sum up the three sources of the “spare cash”: (1) Loans .......... 
. 
 87,400,000 rubles (2) Increased price of state-monop-oly vodka ......... 185,000,000 ” (3) State railways (l eaving out of account 500 million rubles inter-est and amortisation on capitalexpenditure ) ....... 
. 
 158,000,000 ” Total ...... 430,400,000 rubles This would seem to be enough. 
 No need to indicate the less important “sources”. 
 Is it not clear that our feudal-minded landlords are the greatest financial geniuses? Borrowing money, raisingthe price of vodka, “leaving out of account” interest and amortisation on thousands of millions spent (on the “econo-my”)—are not these indications of genius? Are not they proof of the “stability” of our Budget? Pravda No.

 The gold-fields were owned by British capitalists, and their partners were Russian capitalists, members of the tsar’s family, and tsarist dignitaries. 
 The owners made a profit of about 7,000,000 rubles annually. 
 The gold-fields being situated in a region of taiga forests, almost 2,000 kilometres from the Siberian Railway, the capitalists and their helpers committed the worst excesses: they paid the workers niggardly wages for their back-breaking toil, supplied them with rotten food, and outraged the workers’ wives and children. 
 Unable to bear the oppression and outrages any long-er, the workers went on strike early in March 1912. 
 The strike was led by the Bolshevik group formed in the gold-fields in the autumn of 1911. 
 On March 4 (17), 1912, a central strike committee was elected with the Bolsheviks occupying a leading position on it. 
 The demands to be presented to the management included: an eight-hour working day, a 10 to 30 per cent wage increase, abolition of fines, organisation of medical aid, improvement of food and living quarters, etc. 
 The Board of Lenzoto (Lena Gold-Mining Company) rejected these demands and decided to dismiss the strikers, stop supplying them with food on credit and evict them from the gold-fields barracks, which meant dooming the workers and their fami-lies to death by starvation. 
 The workers did not allow the police to carry out the evictions. 
 The strikers held their ground and resist-ed all attempts at provocation and intimidation. 
 The strike was peaceful and organised. 
 At the instance of influential British and Russian shareholders of the company, the tsarist authorities decided to use arms against the strikers in order to intimidate workers in Russia. 
 During the night of April 3-4 (16-17) some of the members of the Central Strike Committee were arrested. 
 In reply, on April 4 (17) about 3,000 workers marched to the Nadezhda Mine to lodge a complaint against the unlawful actions of the authorities and hand the Procurator a petition for the release of those arrested. 
 Captain Treshchenkov of the gendarmerie ordered his men to open fire, with the result that 270 workers were killed and 250 injured. 
 The news of the bloody drama on the Lena aroused the furious indignation of the workers throughout Russia. 
 Protest demonstra-tions, meetings and strikes took place all over the country. 
 The Social-Democratic Duma group interpellated the government on the Lena shootings. 
 The insolent reply of the tsar’s Minister Ma-karov—“So it was and so it will be!”—added to the workers’ indignation. 
 Strikes protesting against the Lena shootings involved about 300,000 workers. 
 They merged with the May Day strikes in which about 400,000 workers took part. 
 “The Lena shootings,” Lenin pointed out, “led to the revolutionary temper of the masses developing into a revolutionary upswing of the masses.

 17 The Duma was a representative assembly which the tsarist govern-ment was forced to convene as a result of the revolutionary events of 1905. 
 Nominally it was a legislative body but it had no real authority. 
 Elections to the Duma were neither direct, nor equal, nor universal. 
 In the case of the working classes, as well as of the non-Russian nationalities of the country, the suffrage was greatly curtailed, a considerable section of the workers and peasants lack-ing any voting rights. 
 Under the electoral law of December 11 (24), 1905, one landlord vote was made equivalent to three votes cast by representatives of the urban bourgeoisie, 15 peasant votes and 45 votes cast by workers. 
 The First and Second Dumas (April-July 1906 and February-June 1907, respectively) were dissolved by the tsarist government. 
 On June 3, 1907, the government carried out a coup d’état and issued a new electoral law which still further curtailed the rights of the workers, peasants and urban petty bourgeoisie and guaran-teed the complete supremacy of the reactionary bloc of the land-lords and big capitalists in the Third and Fourth Dumas (1907-12 and 1912-17).

 p. 
 17 Sovremennik (The Contemporary )—a literary and political monthly published in St. 
 Petersburg from 1911 to 1915, around which were grouped Menshevik liquidators, Socialist-Revolutionaries, Popular Socialists and Left liberals.

 Sixteen issues appeared. 
 p. 
 20 Lenin is referring to the “ initiating groups of Social-Democratic functionaries of the open working-class movement ” which the Men-shevik liquidators formed from the end of 1910 onwards as a coun-ter to the illegal Party organisations. 
 The liquidators regarded those groups as nuclei of the new, broad legal party they were ad-vocating, a party within the framework of the June Third, Stolypin regime. 
 They succeeded in forming “initiating groups” in St. 
 Petersburg, Moscow, Yekaterinoslav and Konstantinovka (Donets coal-field) in the shape of small groups of intellectuals dissociated from the working class. 
 These groups opposed the strike movement and revolutionary demonstrations of the workers, and fought against the Bolsheviks in the Fourth Duma elections. 
 The guiding centres of the “initiating groups” were Golos Sotsial-Demokrata which the liquidators published abroad, and Nasha Zarya and Dye-lo Zhizni , legal liquidationist organs published in Russia.

 22 This refers to the Organising Committee set up by the January 1912 meeting of liquidators representing the Bund, the Caucasian Regional Committee and the Central Committee of the Social-Democrats of the Lettish Territory. 
 Among those who took an active part in the work of the Organising Committee in addition to the non-Russian Social-Democratic organisations were the edito-rial boards of the Vienna Pravda and of Golos Sotsial-Demokrata , the Vperyod group and representatives of the liquidators’ St. 
 Peters-burg “initiating group”. 
 Trotsky was the virtual head of the Organ-ising Committee, which was officially entrusted with convening the August 1912 anti-Party conference. 
 p. 
 22 The Vperyod group was an anti-Party group of otzovists, ultima-tumists, god-builders and empirio-monists (adherents of the reac-tionary, idealist philosophy of Mach and Avenarius). 
 The group was formed in December 1909 on the initiative of A. 
 A. 
 Bogdanov and G. 
 A. 
 Alexinsky. 
 It published a printed organ called Vperyod . 
 In 1912 it united with the Menshevik liquidators to form a general anti-Party bloc (the August bloc) against the Bolsheviks. 
 This bloc was organised by Trotsky. 
 Failing to gain support among the workers, the group virtually fell to pieces in 1913-14. 
 Its final disintegration occurred in 1917 after the February Revolution. 
 The Golos supporters were Menshevik liquidators grouped around Golos Sotsial-Demokrata (P. 
 B. 
 Axelrod, F. 
 I. 
 Dan, L. 
 Martov, A. 
 S. 
 Martynov, A. 
 N. 
 Potresov and others), which was published from February 1908 to December 1911 first in Geneva and then in Paris. 
 The pro-Party Bolsheviks were a group of Bolsheviks who took a conciliatory view of liquidationism and otzovism. 
 Most of the conciliators opposed the Lenin bloc of Bolsheviks and pro-Party Mensheviks. 
 They urged unprincipled unification of the Bolsheviks with various groups that had no support among the masses but sought to exert influence in the Party. 
 21 22 23 24The pro-Party Mensheviks were a small group of Mensheviks led by Plekhanov. 
 They had broken away from the Menshevik liquidators, and opposed liquidationism in 1908-12. 
 p. 
 23 Pravda (Vienna)—a factional newspaper published by the Trots-kyists from 1908 to 1912. 
 Its first three issues were published in Lvov, the rest in Vienna. 
 Twenty-five issues appeared in all. 
 With the exception of its first two issues, which appeared as the organ of the Ukrainian Spilka (Union), the newspaper represented no Party organisation in Russia and was described by Lenin as “a private undertaking”. 
 Its editor was Trotsky. 
 Under cover of “non-factionalism”, the newspaper opposed Bolshevism from the outset, and upheld liquidationism and otzovism. 
 It advocated the centrist theory of “co-operation” between revolutionaries and opportunists within one and the same party. 
 Following the January 1910 Ple-nary Meeting of the Central Committee it took a frankly liquida-tionist stand. 
 It also backed the anti-Party Vperyod group of the otzovists and ultimatumists. 
 In 1912 Trotsky and his newspaper were the initiators and chief organisers of the anti-Party August bloc. 
 p. 
 23 Za Partiyu (For the Party )—a sheet which the pro-Party Menshe-viks and conciliators published at irregular intervals in Paris from April 16 (29), 1912, to February 1914. 
 Five issues were brought out. 
 Among those who wrote for it were G. 
 V. 
 Plekhanov, S. 
 A. 
 Lozovsky and A. 
 I. 
 Lyubimov. 
 It was disseminated chiefly abroad and expressed mainly the views of the Paris group of Plekhanov’s supporters. 
 p. 
 24 The Bund (The General Jewish Workers’ Union of Lithuania, Po-land and Russia) came into being in 1897, at the founding congress of the Jewish Social-Democratic groups in Vilna. 
 In the main, it comprised semi-proletarian Jewish artisans in the west of Russia. 
 It represented nationalism and separatism in Russia’s working-class movement. 
 p. 
 24 Biron , E. 
 I . 
 (1690-1772)—all-powerful favourite of the Empress Anna Ivanovna. 
 He came from the petty nobility of Courland and was not a Russian subject. 
 But while holding no official position, he exerted great influence on the domestic and partly the foreign policy of Russia. 
 He established a terroristic regime and followed a policy of Germanising the state apparatus. 
 He took advantage of his position to rob the Treasury, take bribes and engage in spec-ulative deals. 
 After the death of the Empress he became Regent for a while. 
 He was overthrown in November 1740 as the result of a coup d’état. 
 Arakcheyev , A. 
 A . 
 (1769-1834)—one of the most reactionary representatives of the tsarist autocracy, Minister of War in the reign of Alexander I. 
 A man distinguished by brutality and cru-elty, he exerted tremendous influence on Russia’s home and foreign 25 26 27 28 29 30policies. 
 His name is associated with a long period of reaction and police tyranny, brutal militarism, spying, bribery, corruption and soulless, petty formalism, comprising what became known as the “Arakcheyev regime”.

 p. 
 27 The village commune in Russia was the communal form of peasant use of the land, characterised by compulsory crop rotation, and undivided woods and pastures. 
 Its principal features were collec-tive liability (compulsory collective responsibility of the peasants for timely and full payments, and the fulfilment of all kinds of services for the benefit of the state and the landlords), the periodi-cal redistribution of the land, with no right to refuse the allotment given, and prohibition of its purchase and sale. 
 The landlords and the tsarist government used the village cam-mune to intensify feudal oppression and to squeeze land redemp-tion payments and exactions from the people. 
 p. 
 27 The “ peasant Reform ” of 1861 abolished serfdom in Russia. 
 As a result, the landlords were able to cut off for themselves over one-fifth, or even two-fifths, of the peasants’ land. 
 They retained pos-session of the best parts of the peasants’ allotments (the “cut-off lands”, woods, meadows, watering places, grazing grounds, and so on), without which the peasants could not engage in independent farming. 
 The redemption payments imposed on the peasants for their allotments were nothing short of plunder by the landlords and the tsarist government. 
 To pay off their debts by instalments to the tsarist government, the peasants were granted credit for forty-nine years at 6 per cent interest. 
 Arrears on redemption pay-ments grew from year to year. 
 The former landlord peasants alone paid the government 1,900 million rubles by way of compensation, while the market price of the land transferred to the peasants did not exceed 544 million rubles. 
 The peasants had in effect to pay hundreds of millions of rubles for their land, which led to the ruin of the peasant households. 
 Lenin described the “peasant Reform” of 1861 as the first act of mass violence against the peasantry for the benefit of rising cap-italism in agriculture, as a “clearing of estates” for capitalism by the landlords.

 27 /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR 31 32 33 34 35All-Russia Peasant Union —a revolutionary-democratic organi-sation founded in 1905. 
 Its first and second congresses, held in Moscow in August and November 1905, drew up its programme and tactics. 
 The Union demanded political freedom and the immediate convening of a constituent assembly. 
 It favoured the tactic of boycotting the First Duma. 
 Its agrarian programme included the demand for abolishing private landownership and transferring the monastery, church, crown and state lands to the peasants without compensation. 
 Its policy was half-hearted and vacillating. 
 While insisting on the abolition of the landed estates, the Union was agreeable to partial compensation for the landlords. 
 The Peasant Union was persecuted by the police ever since it came into being. 
 It fell to pieces early in 1907.

 28 Kolokol (The Bell )—a political periodical, published under the motto of Vivos voco ! (I call on the living!) by A. 
 I. 
 Herzen and N. 
 P. 
 Ogaryov at the Free Russian Printing Works established by Herzen. 
 The periodical was published in London from July 1, 1857 to April 1865 and in Geneva from May 1865 to July 1867. 
 It was a monthly, but occasionally it was brought out twice a month. 
 In all 245 issues appeared. 
 In 1868 Kolokol was published in French (15 issues appeared), with an occasional supplement in Russian. 
 It had a circulation of 2,500 copies and it was disseminated throughout Russia. 
 It ex-posed the tyranny of the autocracy, the plunder and embezzlement practised by the civil servants, and the ruthless exploitation of the peasants by the landlords. 
 It issued revolutionary appeals and helped to rouse the people to the struggle against the tsarist government and the ruling classes. 
 Kolokol was the leading organ of the revolutionary uncensored press and the forerunner of the working-class press in Russia. 
 It played an important role in the development of the general-demo-cratic and revolutionary movement, in the struggle against the autocracy and against serfdom. 
 p. 
 28 Polyarnaya Zvezda (The Pole Star)—a literary-political symposi-um. 
 Its first three issues were published by A. 
 I. 
 Herzen, and the subsequent ones by Herzen and Ogaryov, at the Free Russian Printing Works in London from 1855 to 1862. 
 The last issue ap-peared in Geneva in 1868. 
 Altogether eight issues appeared. 
 p.

 p. 
 28 Turgenev , I. 
 S. 
 (1818-1883)—a famous Russian writer who did much for the development of the Russian literary language. 
 His writings reflected the typical contradictions of Russian society. 
 While protesting ardently against serfdom, he put forward mode-rate liberal demands. 
 Lenin said that “Turgenev ... was drawn to-36 37 38 39wards a moderate monarchist and nobleman’s Constitution, ... was repelled by the muzhik democracy of Dobrolyubov and Cherny-shevsky” (see present edition, Vol. 
 27, “The Immediate Tasks ofthe Soviet Government”). 
 p. 
 29 Narodnaya Volya (People ’s Will )—an illegal organisation of the revolutionary-minded intelligentsia, the Narodniks, founded in1879 to combat the tsarist regime. 
 It was active until the secondhalf of the 1880s. 
 p. 
 31 Zvezda (The Star)—a Bolshevik legal newspaper published in St. 
 Petersburg from December 16 (29), 1910, to April 22 (May 5), 1912,at first once a week, from January 1912 twice weekly, and fromMarch onwards three times a week. 
 Among its contributors wereN. 
 N. 
 Baturin, K. 
 S. 
 Yeremeyev, M. 
 S. 
 Olminsky and N. 
 G. 
 Pole-tayev, as well as Maxim Gorky. 
 The pro-Party Mensheviks (Ple-khanovites) were associated with Zvezda until the autumn of 1911. 
 Ideologically the newspaper was led (from abroad) by Lenin, whocontributed about 30 articles to it. 
 Thanks to his guidance, it wasa militant Bolshevik organ upholding the programme and tacticsof the illegal Party. 
 It had an extensive section for workers’ corre-spondence, and kept in constant close touch with the workers. 
 The circulation of some issues was between 50,000 and 60,000 copies. 
 The authorities were constantly taking repressive measures against Zvezda ; they confiscated 30 and fined 8 out of a total of 69 issues. 
 Zvezda prepared the way for the publication of the Bolshe-vik daily, Pravda ; it was closed down by the government on the day the first issue of Pravda appeared.

 17, pp. 
 569-78). 
 p. 
 41 Vekhi (Landmarks )—a Cadet symposium published in Moscow in the spring of 1909. 
 It contained articles by N. 
 Berdayev, S. 
 Bulga-kov, P. 
 Struve, M. 
 Herschensohn and other spokesmen of thecounter-revolutionary liberal bourgeoisie. 
 In their articles on theRussian intelligentsia the Vekhi writers calumniated the revolution-ary-democratic traditions of the foremost representatives of the Russian people, including V. 
 G. 
 Belinsky and N. 
 G. 
 Chernyshev-sky. 
 They smeared the revolutionary movement of 1905 and thankedthe tsarist government for having with “its bayonets and jails”saved the bourgeoisie “from the fury of the people”. 
 Vekhi called on the intelligentsia to serve the autocracy. 
 Lenin compared itsprogramme both in philosophy and in political writing with the programme of the Black-Hundred newspaper, Moskovskiye Vedo-mosti . 
 He called the collection “ an encyclopaedia of liberal rene-gacy ” and “a sheer torrent of reactionary mud turned upon the democratic movement” (see present edition, Vol. 
 16, pp. 
 123-31). 
 p. 
 41 40 41 42 43This refers to the unification of Germany which the German ruling classes undertook “from above” by means of the policy of “bloodand iron”, and through diplomatic intrigue and wars. 
 The Prusso-Austrian war of 1866 resulted in the formation of the North-Ger-man Union, and the Franco-Prussian war of 1870-71 led to the formation of the German Reich. 
 p. 
 45 Svet (Light )—a bourgeois nationalist daily published in St. 
 Peters-burg from 1882 to 1917. 
 Golos Moskvy (Voice of Moscow )—a daily newspaper published by the Octobrist Party, a counter-revolutionary party of the big industrial bourgeoisie and big landlords. 
 It was published in Mos-cow from 1906 to 1915. 
 p. 
 47 Council of the United Nobility —a counter-revolutionary organisa-tion of the feudal landlords founded in May 1906 at the first con-gress of the delegates of the gubernia societies of the nobility. 
 It functioned till October 1917. 
 Its main objective was to defend theautocratic system, the big landed estates and the privileges of thenobility. 
 The Council was headed by Count A. 
 A. 
 Bobrinsky, PrinceN. 
 F. 
 Kasatkin-Rostovsky, Count D. 
 A. 
 Olsufyev, V. 
 M. 
 Purish-kevich and others. 
 Lenin called it the “council of united serf-owners”. 
 The Council virtually became a semi-governmental agency which dictated to the government legislation designed to upholdthe interests of the feudal landlords. 
 A considerable number of itsmembers were also members of the Council of State and the leadingcentres of Black-Hundred organisations. 
 p. 
 47 This refers to the tsar’s Manifesto of June 3 (16), 1907, dissolving the Second Duma and amending the electoral law. 
 The new lawgreatly increased the proportion of members of the Duma repre-senting the landlords and the commercial and industrial bourgeoi-sie, while reducing several times over the proportion of peasant and workers’ deputies, already small. 
 It was a gross violation of the Manifesto of October 17 (30), 1905, and the Fundamental Law of1906, under which all legislation introduced by the governmentwas subject to approval by the Duma. 
 The new Regulations entitled the landowner curia to elect one elector for every 230 persons, the first urban curia one for every 1,000 and the second urban curia for 15,000, the peasant curia for every 60,000 and the worker curia for 125,000. 
 The landlords andthe bourgeoisie elected 65 per cent of the electors, the peasants22 per cent (instead of the former 42) and the workers 2 per cent(as against 4 per cent in the past). 
 The law disfranchised the indi-genous population of Asian Russia and the Turkic peoples of the Astrakhan and Stavropol gubernias, and cut by half the propor-tion of representatives of the population of Poland and theCaucasus. 
 All those who did not speak Russian were disfranchisedthroughout Russia. 
 The Third Duma elected under this law was 44 45 46 47convened on November 1 (14), 1907. 
 It was Black-Hundred and Octobrist in composition. 
 The June Third coup d’état ushered in the period of Stolypin reaction. 
 p. 
 47 The Council of State—one of the supreme organs of state govern-ment in pre-revolutionary Russia, established in 1810—according to a draft submitted by M. 
 M. 
 Speransky—as an advisory legisla-tive body whose members were appointed by the tsar. 
 Under the law of February 20 (March 5), 1906, it was reorganised and author-ised to approve or reject Bills after they had been discussed in the Duma. 
 Nevertheless, the tsar retained the right to amend funda-mental legislation and issue certain laws of special importance. 
 From 1906, one half of the Council members were elected repre-sentatives of the nobility, clergy and big bourgeoisie and the other half were dignitaries appointed by the tsar. 
 Hence it was an extremely reactionary assembly which rejected even moderate Bills passed by the Duma. 
 p. 
 48 Zemstvos —so-called local self-government bodies dominated by the nobility. 
 They were set up in the central gubernias of tsarist Russia in 1864. 
 Their jurisdiction was restricted to purely local economic and welfare matters—hospital and road building, statis-tics, insurance, etc. 
 They functioned under the control of the provincial governors and the Minister of the Interior, who could suspend decisions that did not suit the government. 
 p. 
 49 Lenin is referring to the speech which P. 
 N. 
 Milyukov made at the luncheon given by the Lord Mayor of the City of London in June 1909, during the visit of a delegation from the Third Duma and the Council of State. 
 Milyukov reaffirmed the Cadets’ allegiance to the tsarist autocracy and stressed that as long as Russia had a Duma “the Russian opposition would remain an opposition of, not to, His Majesty”. 
 p. 
 51 Lenin is referring to the decree of November 9 (22), 1906, on “Ad-ditions to Certain Regulations of the Existing Law on Peasant Land Ownership and Land Tenure”, drafted by Stolypin and named the law of June 14, 1910, upon its enactment by the Duma and the Council of State. 
 On November 15 (28), 1906, another decree was issued—“On the Granting of Loans by the Peasant Land Bank on the Security of Allotment Lands”. 
 The two decrees granted the peasants the right to take over their allotments as personal prop-erty and the right to withdraw from the village commune and settle on otrubs or khutor s. 
 Khutor and otrub peasants could obtain subsidies through the Peasant Bank to buy land. 
 The Stolypin agrarian legislation aimed at making the kulaks the new social mainstay of the autocracy in the countryside while preserving the landed estates and forcibly destroying the village communes. 
 The Stolypin agrarian policy speeded up the capitalist evolution of agriculture in the extremely painful “Prussian” way, with the feudal landlords retaining their power, property and privileges. 
 47a 48It intensified the forcible expropriation of the bulk of the peasantry and accelerated the development of the peasant bourgeoisie, whom it enabled to buy up the allotments of the peasant poor at a nomi-nal price. 
 Lenin described the Stolypin agrarian legislation of 1906 (and the law enacted on June 14 [27], 1910) as the second step, after the 1861 Reform, towards transforming the feudal autocracy into a bourgeois monarchy. 
 Although the government vigorously advocated the withdrawal of peasants from the village communes, only some 2,500,000 peas-ant households withdrew from them in European Russia over nine years (1907-15). 
 The right to secede from the village commune was used above all by the rural bourgeoisie, which was thus enabled to strengthen its farms. 
 Some of the poor peasants who wanted to sell their allotments and end their connection with the countryside seceded too. 
 The small peasants, crushed by want, remained pover-ty-stricken and backward. 
 The Stolypin agrarian policy did not remove the main contra-diction between the peasantry as a whole and the landlord class. 
 Moreover, it brought further ruin to the mass of the peasantry and aggravated the class antagonisms between the kulaks and the peasant poor. 
 p. 
 53 The Polish Kolo (Circle) was an association of Polish deputies to the Duma. 
 In the First and Second Dumas, its leading core was composed of National-Democrats, members of the reactionary, nationalist party of the Polish landlords and bourgeoisie. 
 The Kolo backed the Octobrists on all major tactical issues. 
 p. 
 55 The article “A Questionnaire on the Organisations of Big Capital” appeared in Prosveshcheniye Nos. 
 5-7. 
 Prosveshcheniye (Enlightenment ) was a socio-political and liter-ary monthly published by the Bolsheviks legally in St. 
 Peters-burg from December 1911 to June 1914. 
 It was founded on direc-tions from Lenin to replace the Bolshevik periodical, Mysl (Mos-cow), closed down by the authorities. 
 Lenin, who was abroad, guided Prosveshcheniye by editing articles for it and maintaining a regular correspondence with the members of its Editorial Board. 
 The periodical published “The Three Sources and Three Component Parts of Marxism”, “Critical Remarks on the National Question”, “The Right of Nations to Self-Determination”, and other works by Lenin. 
 The Editorial Board of Prosveshcheniye included M. 
 A. 
 Savelyev, M. 
 S. 
 Olminsky and A. 
 I. 
 Yelizarova. 
 The art and literature sec-tion was edited by Maxim Gorky. 
 The circulation reached 5,000 copies. 
 Prosveshcheniye was closed down by the authorities on the eve of the First World War. 
 In the autumn of 1917, however, it re-sumed publication, but only one (double) issue was brought out; it contained Lenin’s works “Can the Bolsheviks Retain State Power?” and “Revision of the Party Programme”.

 On the agrarian question he upheld the reactionary theory of the “stability” of small-scale agriculture and the pseudo-scientific bourgeois “law of diminishing returns”.

 It was closed down by the Military Revolutionary Committee under the Petrograd Soviet on October 26 (November 8), 1917. 
 p. 
 71 Nevskaya Zvezda (The Neva Star)—a legal Bolshevik newspaper published in St. 
 Petersburg from February 26 (March 10) to Octo-ber 5 (18), 1912. 
 Twenty-seven issues appeared. 
 At first the news-paper appeared simultaneously with Zvezda , which it was intended to replace in the event of the latter’s closure or confiscation. 
 After April 22 (May 5), 1912, it was published instead of Zvezda , which was closed down by the authorities. 
 It published twenty articles by Lenin.

 81This refers to the tsar’s Manifesto of October 17, 1905, published at the height of the All-Russia October political strike. 
 The Mani-festo promised “civil liberties” and a “legislative” Duma. 
 It was a political stratagem of the autocracy designed to gain time, split the revolutionary forces, foil the strike and suppress the revolu-tion. 
 It was a concession wrested from the tsarist regime by the rev-olution, but that concession by no means decided the fate of the revolution, as the liberals and Mensheviks claimed. 
 The Bolshe-viks exposed the real meaning of the Manifesto. 
 On October 18 (31), 1905, the Central Committee of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 issued its appeal “To the Russian People” revealing the spurious nature of the Manifesto and calling for a continued struggle. 
 “We still need the strike,” said the appeal, “to show our enemies that they cannot appease us with a mere slip of paper, and that we want genuine rights and genuine strength.

 p. 
 81 This refers to the Party of Peaceful Renovation, a constitutional-monarchist organisation of the big bourgeoisie and the landlords. 
 It took final shape in 1906, following the dissolution of the First Duma. 
 It grouped the “Left” Octobrists and Right Cadets. 
 Among its leaders were P. 
 A. 
 Heyden, N. 
 P. 
 Lvov, P. 
 P. 
 Ryabushinsky, M. 
 A. 
 Stakhovich, Y. 
 N. 
 and G. 
 N. 
 Trubetskoi, and D. 
 N. 
 Shipov. 
 The Peaceful Renovators’ programme was close to the Octo-brist programme. 
 It defended the interests of the commercial and industrial bourgeoisie and the landlords who conducted their farm-ing on capitalist lines. 
 Lenin called the Party of Peaceful Ren-ovation a “party of peaceful plunder”. 
 In the Third Duma this party merged with the Party of Democratic Reform into the Progressist group. 
 p. 
 81 Utro Rossii (Morning of Russia )—a daily newspaper published in Moscow from September 1907 to April 1918 (with a break in 1908). 
 Although it called itself a “non-partisan democratic publication”, it reflected the interests of the Russian imperialist bourgeoisie. 
 It was a Progressist mouthpiece subsidised by Ryabushinsky’s bank. 
 It was closed down early in April 1918 for slanderous state-ments against Soviet rule. 
 From the middle of April to July 1918 it was published under the title of Zarya Rossii (Dawn of Russia ).

 p. 
 86 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71Russkiye Vedomosti (Russian Recorder )—a newspaper published in Moscow from 1863 onwards by moderately liberal intellectuals. 
 Between the 1880s and 1890s contributors to it included writers of the democratic camp—V. 
 G. 
 Korolenko, M. 
 Y. 
 Saltykov-Shche-drin, G. 
 I. 
 Uspensky and others—and it also published articles by liberal Narodniks. 
 In 1905 it became an organ of the Right wing of the Cadet Party. 
 Lenin pointed out that the newspaper “pro-vided a unique combination of Right Cadetism and Narodnik over-tones” (see present edition, Vol. 
 19, p. 
 135). 
 In 1918 it was closed down along with other counter-revolutionary newspapers. 
 p. 
 86 Nevsky Golos (Neva Voice )—a legal newspaper of the Menshevik liquidators, published in St. 
 Petersburg from May to August 1912. 
 p. 
 87 In Russian political writing, the term “diehard” ( zubr , literally, aurochs) was applied to the extreme Right-wing representatives of landlord reaction.

 p. 
 91Temporarily bonded peasants —serfs who after the abolition of serfdom in 1861 were obliged to perform certain services for the landlords, i. 
e. 
, do corvée service or pay quit-rent. 
 The temporarily bonded status of the peasants continued until they had, by agree-ment with the landlords, acquired their allotments by paying cam-pensation. 
 It was only under the decree of 1881, which discontinued the “obligatory relation” between the peasants and the landlords as from January 1, 1883, that the landlords were obliged to accept compensation. 
 p. 
 95 In 1889 the tsarist government introduced the administrative of-fice of rural superintendent to strengthen landlord rule over the peasants. 
 The rural superintendents, who were selected from among the landed nobility, were vested with vast administrative and also judicial powers over the peasants, including the right to arrest peasants and subject them to corporal punishment.

 In all 58 issues appeared. 
 The first issue appeared in Russia, 72 73 74 75 76and then publication was transferred, first to Paris and afterwards to Geneva. 
 By decision of the Central Committee of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
, the Editorial Board consisted of representatives of the Bolsheviks, Mensheviks and Polish Social-Democrats. 
 Sotsial-Demokrat published more than eighty articles and other items by Lenin. 
 On its Editorial Board Lenin upheld a consistent-ly Bolshevik line. 
 Two members of the Board—Kamenev and Zinovyev—took a conciliatory view of the liquidators and tried to defeat Lenin’s line. 
 Another two members, the Mensheviks Martov and Dan, obstructed the work of the Board and at the same time openly defended liquidationism in Golos Sotsial-Demokrata . 
 Lenin’s uncompromising struggle against the liquidators re-sulted in Martov and Dan resigning from the Editorial Board in June 1911. 
 From December 1911 the newspaper was edited by Lenin. 
 p. 
 104 The leaflet mentioned by Lenin was printed in St. 
 Petersburg and circulated at the factories before May 1, 1912. 
 It called on the workers to hold meetings and demonstrations in Nevsky Prospekt on May Day, under the slogans put forward by the Sixth (Prague) All-Russia Conference of the R. 
S.

P. 
: “A constituent assem-bly, an eight-hour working day, and confiscation of the landed estates. 
” The leaflet ended with the militant appeals: “Down with the tsar’s government! Down with the autocratic Constitution of June 3! Long live a democratic republic! Long live socialism!” It was signed: “Meeting of Representatives of All Organised Work-ers of St. 
 Petersburg”, “Social-Democratic ‘Unity’ Group”, “City Central Social-Democratic Group”, “Group of Worker Socialist-Revolutionaries”, “Group of Worker Social-Democrats of St. 
 Pe-tersburg”, and “Representatives of May Day Committees”. 
 On June 4 (17), 1912, the full text of the leaflet was published in the news section of Sotsial-Demokrat No. 
 27. 
 p. 
 104 The December uprising was the armed uprising of the Moscow work-ers against the autocracy in December 1905. 
 For nine days the workers, led by the Moscow Bolshevik Social-Democrats, fought gallantly on the barricades against the tsar’s troops. 
 The govern-ment did not succeed in crushing the revolt until fresh troops arrived from St. 
 Petersburg. 
 It dealt with the insurgents with monstrous cruelty; the workers’ districts ran with blood, and thou-sands of workers were killed in Moscow and the vicinity. 
 p. 
 107 The Okhrana was an agency of the secret police in tsarist Russia, in charge of political investigation. 
 It was under the jurisdiction of the Police Department.

 Petersburg workers who were marching to the Winter Palace with the priest Gapon at their head to submit 77 78 79 80 81 82a petition to the tsar. 
 The atrocious shooting of the defenceless workers gave rise to mass political strikes and demonstrations all over Russia under the slogan of “Down with the autocracy!” The events of January 9 were the starting-point of the revolution of 1905-07. 
 p. 
 113 Budushcheye (L’Avenir )—a liberal bourgeois weekly published in Paris from October 1911 to January 1914 in Russian (some items were published in French). 
 It was edited by V.

 They sought to isolate the Jewish workers from the revo-lutionary struggle of the world proletariat, and advocated a cam-promise with the bourgeoisie with a view to bringing about the establishment of a Jewish state. 
 p. 
 118 The Lettish Social-Democratic Union , founded abroad in the autumn of 1900, put forward demands that were close to those of the Russian Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
 It was imbued to a consid-erable extent with nationalist tendencies. 
 In 1905 it gained some influence among a section of the peasantry, but it was not long before the Lettish Social-Democratic Labour Party superseded it. 
 Subsequently the Union ceased to play any appreciable role.

 p. 
 118 Lenin has in mind the Menshevik liquidators’ plan to liquidate the illegal Party and replace it by a “broad”, petty-bourgeois labour party without a programme, a party similar to the British Labour Party, with a supreme body in the form of a “labour con-gress” in which Social-Democrats, Socialist-Revolutionaries and anarchists alike would be represented. 
 Lenin exposed this exceed-ingly harmful attempt of the Mensheviks to liquidate the Social-Democratic Labour Party and dilute the vanguard of the working class with petty-bourgeois elements. 
 This idea of the Menshevik liquidators amounted to renunciation of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

 121 The Organising Commission Abroad (O. 
C. 
A. 
) for the convening of a general Party conference was established by a meeting of mem-bers of the Central Committee on June 1 (14), 1911, and consisted of representatives of the Bolsheviks, conciliators and Polish So-cial-Democrats. 
 The other organisations and groups abroad which had been invited to join the Commission did not send their repre-sentatives. 
 The O. 
C. 
A. 
 sent a group of Party functionaries to Russia, including its authorised representative G. 
 K. 
 Orjonikidze, to help in making preparations for the planned conference. 
 It also issued an appeal “To All Social-Democratic Party Organisations, Groups and Circles”, calling on them to set about electing members to the Russian Organising Commission (R. 
O. 
C. 
). 
 But as soon as the O. 
C. 
A. 
 was set up a majority in it was gained by the conciliators and the Polish Social-Democrats who backed them. 
 The concilia-tory majority pursued an unprincipled policy aimed at continuing talks with the Vperyod group and Trotsky, who had refused to send their delegates to the O. 
C. 
A. 
 The conciliators’ publications ac-cused the Bolsheviks of factionalism. 
 They used their predominance on the O. 
C. 
A. 
 to hold up the dispatch of Party money to Russia and obstructed preparations for the conference. 
 As a result of the work done by the Bolsheviks, the Russian Or-ganising Commission was set up. 
 At the end of October the O. 
C. 
A. 
 discussed the Notification which the R. 
O. 
C. 
 had adopted concern-ing its establishment and its resolutions by which it assumed full powers for the convening of the conference while the Organising and the Technical commissions were to be subordinated to the R. 
O. 
C. 
 After the conciliatory majority of the O. 
C. 
A. 
 had refused to submit to these decisions the Bolshevik representatives with-drew from the O. 
C. 
A. 
 On October 30 (November 12) Orjonikidze, who had arrived in Paris, made a report to the meeting of the O. 
C. 
A. 
 on the activities of the R. 
O. 
C. 
, whereupon the O. 
C. 
A. 
 was compelled to recognise the leading role of the R. 
O. 
C. 
 Nevertheless, it was not long before the O. 
C. 
A. 
 began an open fight against the R. 
O. 
C. 
 On November 20 (December 3) it issued a leaflet entitled “An Open Letter to the Russian Organising Commission” accusing the R. 
O. 
C. 
 of factionalism. 
 The anti-Party actions of the O. 
C. 
A. 
 87 88 89 90 91were exposed by Orjonikidze in a letter to the Editor published in Sotsial-Demokrat No. 
 25, on December 8 (21), 1911. 
 The entire work of convening the Party conference, held in January 1912, was carried out by the R. 
O. 
C. 
, which had rallied all the illegal Party organisations in Russia. 
 p. 
 121 This refers to the following facts: In October 1910 F. 
 A. 
 Golovin, a member of the Third Duma, announced that he was resigning his powers as a deputy, and short-ly afterwards took an active part in a railway concession. 
 In March 1912 V. 
 A. 
 Maklakov, another member of the Third Duma, in spite of his status as a deputy, acted as defence counsel for Tagiyev, a big oil industrialist of Baku charged with manhandling Bebutov, an engineer employed by him. 
 p. 
 130 By “ political babes ” Lenin means here the Bolshevik conciliators who had their little groups in Russia and abroad. 
 The “ seasoned diplomats ” were the few liquidators grouped around Trotsky’s Vienna Pravda , and the Bund leaders. 
 p. 
 133 Lenin is referring to the law of December 11 (24), 1905, on elec-tions to the Duma. 
 That law divided the electorate into four curias —landowner (landlords), urban (the bourgeoisie), peasant and work-er. 
 It granted the suffrage to persons who had reached the age of 25 years. 
 With regard to the landowner and urban curias, it estab-lished property qualifications; in the peasant curia, only house-holders had the right of suffrage, and in the worker curia, only per-sons who had been working on their job for at least six months. 
 The elections were unequal. 
 One landlord vote equalled 3 capital-ist, 15 peasant and 45 workers’ votes. 
 The law debarred from elec-tions women, agricultural workers, unskilled workers, handicrafts-men, students and servicemen. 
 In the case of the worker curia, the suffrage was granted only to those in factories employing at least fifty male workers. 
 Factories employing over a thousand workers elected one delegate for every full thousand. 
 Elections wore multi-stage: two-stage for the landlords and capitalists, three-stage for the workers and four-stage for the peasants. 
 For the law of June 3, 1907, see Note 43.

 These propositions of Marx’s were set forth and explained by Lenin in “The Agrarian Question in Russia Towards the Close of the Nine-teenth Century” (see present edition, Vol. 
 15, pp. 
 139-42). 
 p. 
 145 Gazeta Robotnicza (Workers ’ Newspaper )—an illegal organ pub-lished by the Warsaw Committee of the Social-Democratic Party of Poland and Lithuania from May to October 1906. 
 Publication was resumed in 1912. 
 The split among the Polish Social-Democrats in 1912 gave rise to two parallel Party committees. 
 There were two Warsaw Committees and two newspapers bearing the same title of Gazeta Robotnicza , one of them being published by the supporters 92 93 94 95 96of the Executive Committee in Warsaw and the other by the oppositionist Warsaw Committee in Cracow. 
 Lenin’s article “The Situation in the R. 
S. 
D.

P. 
 and the Immediate Tasks of the Party” was published in the Cracow Gazeta Robotnicza No. 
 15-16.

 p. 
 152This refers to the meeting which the liquidators held in Russia in the middle of January 1912. 
 The meting was called on the initia-tive of the Bund and the Contra Committee of the Social-Democrat-ic Party of the Lettish Territory. 
 It is known as the “Meeting of National Social-Democratic Organisations”. 
 It was attended by two delegates from the Lettish Social-Democrats, two from the Bund, one from the Caucasian Regional Committee and one from the So-cial-Democracy of Poland and Lithuania (this last delegate was present only at the second sitting). 
 The meeting set up an Organis-ing Committee for convening the Trotskyist-liquidationist August conference of 1912.

 Publication was suspended between 1914 and 1917. 
 In all 195 issues appeared. 
 p. 
 156 Lenin s note “ A Reply to the Liquidators ” was written for Pravda , the Editorial Board of which received it on July 11 (24), 1912. 
 p. 
 156 Pravda (Truth )—a legal Bolshevik daily newspaper published in St. 
 Petersburg, was founded on the initiative of the St. 
 Petersburg workers in April 1912. 
 Its first issue appeared on April 22 (May 5), 1912. 
 Pravda was published with money collected by the workers. 
 In 1912 the workers made 620 group contributions to the Bolshevik press, 2,181 in 1913 and 2,873 from January to May 1914. 
 Among the correspondents of Pravda were advanced workers. 
 In the course of one year alone the newspaper published more than 11,000 items by worker correspondents. 
 Its circulation reached 40,000 to 60,000 copies daily. 
 Lenin, who was abroad, guided Pravda and contributed to it almost every day. 
 He gave directions to the editors and gathered the Party’s best writers round the newspaper. 
 Pravda was a constant target of police persecution. 
 In the first year of its existence it was confiscated 41 times; its editors were sued 36 times and hold in prison for a total of 47 2 months. 
 During two years and three months the tsarist government closed down the newspaper eight times, but it continued to appear under different 97 98 99 100 101 102 103titles: Rabochaya Pravda , Severnaya Pravda , Pravda Truda , Za Pravdu , Proletarskaya Pravda , Put Pravdy , Rabochy , and Trudo-vaya Pravda . 
 It was closed down again on July 8 (21), 1914, shortly before the beginning of the First World War. 
 Publication was not resumed until after the February Revolu-tion of 1917. 
 On March 5 (18), 1917, Pravda began to appear as the Central Organ of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
(B. 
). 
 Upon his return from abroad on April 5 (18), Lenin became a member of the Editorial Board and assumed the leadership of the newspaper. 
 Between July and October 1917 Pravda , being persecuted by the Provisional Government, had to change its title four times—to Listok Pravdy , Proletary , Rabochy and Rabochy Put . 
 From October 27 (Novem-ber 9) onwards it appeared under its old title of Pravda . 
 p. 
 158 This refers to the resolution of the Board of the St. 
 Petersburg Bak-ers’ Union in favour of the publication of an anti-liquidationist workers’ daily. 
 The Board hailed the forthcoming publication of Pravda and called on the membership to collect money for the fu-ture newspaper. 
 A report on the resolution appeared in Zvezda No. 
 27, on April 8 (21), 1912. 
 p. 
 175 Zavety (Behests )—a literary and political monthly of a So-cialist-Revolutionary trend, published legally in St.

 p. 
 183 This refers to the rebellion which the Portuguese monarchists launched in the summer of 1912 to restore the monarchy. 
 The rebellion was put down. 
 p. 
 183 The article “ The Results of Six Months ’ Work ” was written in the first half of July 1912. 
 Lenin’s correspondence with Pravda concern-ing the publication of this article survived. 
 In one of his letters to Pravda , Lenin asked the editors to print the article in four in-stalments, as separate feature articles, and agreed only to correc-tions made for censorship reasons. 
 The article was published in the form suggested by Lenin.

 Its main point is the letter of the C. 
C. 
 of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 written on July 16-17 (29-30). 
 The letter was a reply to the appeal of the Executive of the German Social-Demo-cratic Party on the convening of the R.

 The Executive of the German Social-Democrats assigned part of the funds to the liquidators’ Organising Committee and Caucasian Regional Committee, to the Bund and to the Central Committee of the Lettish Social-Democratic Party, thereby backing the liquidators against the Bolsheviks. 
 The pamphlet Con-cerning the Present Situation in the R. 
 S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 was circulated by the editors of Sotsial-Demokrat to the regional and district centres of the German Social-Democratic Party, the delegates of the Party Congress held in Chemnitz in September 1912, and the editors of the major Social-Democratic newspapers of Germany.

 In 1912 there were only small disconnected groups of the Spilka and by then most of its members had become bourgeois nationalists. 
 Trotsky’s liquidationist Pravda (Vienna) was published as an organ of the Spilka only in October and Decem-ber 1908 (the first two issues). 
 p. 
 207 The Ninth International Socialist Congress of the Second Inter-national was to meet in Vienna in the autumn of 1913, but the war which broke out in the Balkans in 1912 and the threat of a world war prompted the International Socialist Bureau to convene an extraordinary congress in Basle on November 24-25, 1912. 
 p. 
 216 This refers to the August conference of the liquidators , which met in Vienna in August 1912 and formed the anti-Party August bloc. 
 110 111 112 113 114The bloc was organised by Trotsky. 
 The conference was attended by delegates from the Bund, the Caucasian Regional Committee, the Social-Democratic Party of the Lettish Territory and small liquidationist groups abroad: the editors of Golos Sotsial-Demokra-ta, Trotsky’s Vienna Pravda and the Vperyod group. 
 Delegates from Russia were sent by the St. 
 Petersburg and Moscow “initiating groups” of the liquidators and the editorial boards of the liquida-tionist Nasha Zarya and Nevsky Golos . 
 A representative of the Spil-ka Committee Abroad was present too. 
 The overwhelming majori-ty of the delegates were people who lived abroad and were out of touch with the working class of Russia. 
 The conference adopted anti-Party liquidationist decisions on all the questions of Social-Democratic tactics and declared against the existence of the illegal Party. 
 Being composed of heterogeneous elements, the August bloc began to fall apart even while the conference was meeting. 
 The liquidators were unable to elect a Central Committee and limited themselves to setting up an Organising Committee. 
 The blows deliv-ered by the Bolsheviks soon resulted in the final disintegration of the bloc.

 Zubatov’s activity in this field was supported by V. 
 K. 
Plehve, Minister of the Interior. 
 The Zubatovists sought to directthe working-class movement into the narrow channel of purely eco-nomic demands, and suggested to the workers that the govern-ment was willing to meet those demands. 
 The first Zubatovistorganisation—the Society for Mutual Assistance of MechanicalIndustry Workers—was set up in Moscow in May 1901. 
 Similarorganisations were founded in Minsk, Odessa, Vilna, Kiev andother cities. 
 The revolutionary Social-Democrats, in exposing the reaction-ary character of Zubatovism, used legal workers’ organisationsto draw large sections of the working class into the struggle againstthe autocracy. 
 The growing revolutionary movement in 1903 cam-pelled the tsarist government to abolish the Zubatovist organisa-tions.

 On account of this speech the Chair-man of the Duma moved that Voiloshnikov be excluded from the next five sittings. 
 Following Voiloshnikov’s second speech at the same sitting the period of exclusion was increased to fifteen sittings. 
 The Cadets voted for the original motion of the Chairman.

 395 The Polish Social-Democrats ’ “territorial conference ” met on Au-gust 11-17 (N.

 All the participants were supporters of the Executive Committee of the Social-Democratic Party of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania (Zarzadists), which took a con-ciliatory position in regard to the liquidators and opposed the Roz-lamists, who upheld the Bolshevik standpoint. 
 The Conference approved the activities of the Executive and resolved to dissolve the Party organisations that supported the Rozlamists. 
 It declared for a tactical agreement with the Bund and the Left wing of the P.

 The in-vaders drew near Moscow and camped in the village of Tushino. 
 The Impostor formed a government with its own Court as a counter to the Moscow government. 
 Some of the Russian noblemen and bo-yars deserted alternately to the Moscow and the Tushino govern-ments in an effort to safeguard themselves in the event of the vic-tory of either side. 
 It was those deserters that were nicknamed “Tushino turncoats”.

 In all, 237 issues appeared. 
 The newspaper was supported chiefly by donations from the liberals. 
 Ideologically it was directed by P. 
 B. 
 Axelrod, F. 
 I. 
 Dan, L. 
 Martov and A. 
 S. 
 Mar-tynov. 
 The liquidators used it to oppose the Bolshevik’s revolution-ary tactics. 
 They advocated the opportunist slogan of founding a so-called open party, opposed revolutionary mass strikes, and sought to revise the major provisions of the Party Programme. 
 Lenin wrote that “ Luch has been enslaved by a liberal policy” and called it a renegade organ. 
 p. 
 410 The term “ Austrian ” federation refers to the Austrian Social-Demo-cratic Party’s organisation on the national principle. 
 The Vienna Party Congress in 1897 abolished the united party, and replaced it by a federation of six national “Social-Democratic groups”: German, Czech Polish, Ruthenian, Italian and South Slav. 
 These groups were all united by a joint congress and a common Central Executive. 
 The Brünn Congress in 1899 reorganised the Central Executive into a federal body composed of the executive commit-tees of the national Social-Democratic parties. 
 Organisational fed-eralism resulted in the break-up of the integral Social-Democratic Party of Austria. 
 p. 
 412149 150 151148147 Lenin’s theses “ Concerning Certain Speeches by Workers ’ Deputies ” formed the basis of a declaration by the Social-Democratic groupin the Fourth Duma. 
 The manuscript has survived only in part. 
 The adoption of the declaration was preceded by a bitter fight of the Bolshevik deputies against the seven Menshevik members of the group. 
 A. 
 Y. 
 Badayev, a Bolshevik member of the group,wrote in his recollections: “Our group devoted a number of meet-ings to the declaration, which it began to discuss before the Dumaopened. 
 The debate was exceedingly heated and often lasted tilllate into the night. 
 On either side not only deputies but also Party functionaries then in St. 
 Petersburg took part in drafting the dec-laration.... 
 After a long and stubborn struggle and a number ofheated clashes with the Mensheviks we at last had all the funda-mental demands of the Bolsheviks incorporated in the declara-tion. 
” (A. 
 Badayev, The Bolsheviks in the Duma. 
 Recollections , Moscow, 1954, p. 
 67, Russ. 
 ed. 
) In accordance with Lenin’s directives, the declaration included nearly all the main provisions of the minimum programme. 
 Never-theless, the Mensheviks succeeded in getting the demand for cul-tural national autonomy included in the declaration. 
 On Decem-ber 7 (20), 1912, the declaration was read in the Duma. 
 On December 8 (21), 1912, Pravda carried a verbatim report of the Duma sitting together with the text of the declaration. 
 This Pravda issue was confiscated for publishing the declaration, and its editor brought to trial.

 413 The Extraordinary International Socialist Congress of the Second International took place in Basle on November 24-25, 1912. 
 On the opening day there was a large anti-war demonstration and an international protest meeting against the war. 
 On November 25the Congress unanimously adopted a manifesto calling on theworkers to use the organisation and might of the proletariat for arevolutionary struggle against the war danger. 
 p. 
 414 This refers to the unrest among the political prisoners in the Ku-tomara and Algachi prisons. 
 It began in August 1912 owing to theTransbaikal Military Governor’s order introducing military rulesof treatment of political prisoners in Nerchinsk penal-servitudeprisons. 
 In protest, the political prisoners at Kutomara declared afifteen-day hunger strike. 
 The prison administration retaliated by mass torture. 
 Some of the prisoners, driven to despair, committed suicide. 
 Similar events took place in Algachi prison. 
 The summerand autumn of 1912 saw unrest among political prisoners elsewherein Russia. 
 In response to these developments there were proteststrikes of workers in St. 
 Petersburg, Moscow, Warsaw and Riga. 
On behalf of the Social-Democratic and the Trudovik groups in the Fourth Duma, an interpellation was made concerning the outrages against the prisoners. 
 Discussion was postponed by a majorityvote but was never resumed. 
 p. 
 417152 153 154 This refers to the land Bill which was introduced by (non-party and Right-wing) peasant deputies in the Third Duma on May 10 (23),1908. 
 The Bill provided for the compulsory alienation, at averagemarket prices, of landed estates not tilled by their owners them-selves. 
 For carrying out the land reform, it was proposed that local land committees should be set up to be elected by a general vote. 
Lenin appraised the Bill in his article “The Agrarian Debates in p.

 It was copied by N.

 The draft was intercepted by the tsar’s police. 
 p. 
 420 The demonstration was organised on the initiative of the Bolshe-vik representatives of various districts and factories of St. 
 Peters-burg. 
 A few days prior to the opening of the Fourth Duma a leafletwas distributed in the factories calling on the workers to organisea one-day political strike on November 15 (28), 1912, and to marchto the Taurida Palace. 
 The liquidators, writing in Luch , opposed the idea of a march. 
 On November 13 (26) the Social-Democratic group called a meeting of representatives of the St. 
 Petersburg Committee, the Editorial Board of Pravda , the liquidators’ leading centre—the Organising Committee, and the liquidationist Luch . 
 At the meeting the Bolsheviks supported the workers’ proposalto mark the opening day of the Black-Hundred Duma by a strikeand demonstration. 
 The liquidators emphatically opposed it. 
 After the meeting the Social-Democratic group published in the press a politically erroneous statement in which they took a negative standon the proposal for a strike. 
 Despite the opposition of the liqui-dators and the political error of the Social-Democratic group, tensof thousands of workers struck on the day the Duma opened. 
 In anumber of factories short meetings were held at which the workers decided to boycott Luch . 
 After the demonstration the Bolshevik members of the Duma admitted their error at workers’ meetings.

 Jagiello , J. 
 I. 
 —a member of the Polish Socialist Party (P.

 The Bolshe-viks strongly objected to Jagiello’s admission into the Social-Democratic group because he had been elected to the Duma thanks to the support of the bourgeoisie and the bloc of the P. 
S. 
P. 
 and the Bund. 
 When the issue was first put to the vote, the group split, six Menshevik deputies voting for and six Bolshevik deputies against Jagiello. 
 With the arrival of the Right Menshevik Man-kov deputy for Irkutsk, the Mensheviks gained a majority and Jagiello was admitted into the group. 
 But under pressure from the Bolshevik deputies his rights within the group were restricted: he was granted a voice but no vote on all inner-Party questions.

 4 29 The delegates from the worker curia of St. 
 Petersburg Gubernia for the Fourth Duma met on October 5 (18), 1912, with 50 delegates present. 
 Of the six electors elected by the delegates, four were Bol-sheviks. 
 The tsarist government was afraid that the Social-Democrats might win in the worker curia and therefore it cancelled the elec-tion of delegates in twenty-one St. 
 Petersburg factories. 
 In reply, the St. 
 Petersburg Committee of the Bolsheviks called on the work-ers for a one-day political strike. 
 The strike involved about 100,000 workers. 
 The government had to give in and announced supplemen-tary elections. 
 At all the factories where these elections were held the workers adopted a “Mandate of the St. 
 Petersburg Workers to Their Workers’ Deputy”. 
 On October 17 (30) the Mandate was passed by a new gubernia meeting. 
 But during the second election of electors the vote was not taken by platforms, with the result that three Bolsheviks and three liquidators were elected. 
 The Bolsheviks proposed to the liquidators that lots should be cast to decide who was to be nominated for election to the Duma for the worker curia. 
 The liquidators rejected the proposal. 
 The gubernia meeting of electors elected A. 
 Y. 
 Badayev, a Bolshevik, for the worker curia of St.

 Participants in it included Lenin, N. 
 K. 
 Krup-skaya and the Bolshevik deputies to the Fourth Duma: A. 
 Y. 
 Ba-dayev, G. 
 I. 
 Petrovsky and N. 
 R. 
 Shagov. 
 It was also attended by delegates from the illegal Party organisations of St. 
 Petersburg, the Moscow Region, the South, the Urals and the Caucasus. 
 The preparations for the Meeting were made by Lenin himself, who also presided over it. 
 He spoke on a number of items and wrote the “Notification and Resolutions of the Meeting”. 
 The Meeting adopted decisions on major issues of the working-class movement. 
 It discussed reports by delegates on the state of local Party organisations, and the work of the editorial boards of Pravda and Prosveshcheniye . 
 The resolutions of the Meeting were endorsed by the Central Committee and were hectographed. 
 In the first half of February they were published together with the Notification as a separate pamphlet in Paris. 
 In April 1913 the Central Committee Bureau Abroad circulated a letter to the Party organisations, delegates of the C.

 461 At the fourteenth sitting of the Duma on December 15 (28), 1912, following the debate on the Government Declaration, the Cadets, Progressists, Trudoviks and nationalists proposed draft formulas of procedure to the next business. 
 The Progressist formula was carried by majority vote. 
 It expressed confidence that the govern ment would implement the Manifesto of October 17, 1905. 
 Mem bers of the Social-Democratic group voted for this formula. 
 After wards they admitted their vote to have been ill-advised. 
 p. 
 461 The unpublished clauses (7, 8 and 9) of the resolution on the work of the Social-Democratic Duma group called on the Bolshevik deputies to achieve equality in the group with the seven Menshe viks, strike their names off the list of contributors to the liquida tionist Luch and rally together for Party work.

 469 Before the delegates from the worker curia of St. 
 Petersburg Gu-bernia held their congress (October 5 [18], 1912) to elect electors to the Fourth Duma, the government gave a so-called clarification on twenty-one of the forty-four factories that had taken part in the elections, saying that the election of delegates at those factories had been found null and void. 
 In reply to this government move, the workers in a number of St. 
 Petersburg factories called a politi-cal strike. 
 The strike, which soon spread to every district of St. 
 Petersburg, was accompanied by mass meetings and demonstra-tions. 
 See also Note 164.

 On November 11 (24), 1912, the Riga workers organised a protest demonstration against the death sen-tences on a group of sailors of the battleship Ioann Zlatoust passed by a court martial in Sevastopol, against the torturing of political prisoners, and against the war that had begun in the Balkans. 
 Over 1,500 workers marched through the streets of Riga singing revolutionary songs and carrying red flags. 
 They were received sympathetically by the population. 
 On November 12 (25) many large factories in the city began a political strike. 
 On November 8 (21) the workers in a number of Moscow factories went on strike in protest against the Sevastopol executions. 
 There was also a demonstration but the police soon dispersed it.

 On January 12180 181 182 183 184 185 186 187 (25), 1913, Lenin sent the article to Rubakin in Clarens, Switzer-land, with a letter stipulating that the article “should not be al-tered in any way ” (see Present edition, Vol. 
 35, Russian ed.

 485 Iskra (The Spark )—the first all-Russia illegal Marxist newspaper. 
 It was founded by Lenin in December 1900 abroad, from where it was secretly sent to Russia. 
 It played a tremendous part in uniting the Russian Social-Democrats ideologically and paving the way for the unification of scattered local organisations in a revolution-ary Marxist party. 
 After the split into Bolsheviks and Mensheviks that took place at the Second Congress of the R. 
S.

 485 The Zemstvo campaign was conducted by bourgeois liberals be-tween the autumn of 1904 and January 1905. 
 It consisted of a seriesof congresses, public meetings and banquets at which speeches were made and resolutions passed in support of moderate constitutional demands. 
 Lenin sharply criticised the Menshevik attitude of sup-port for the campaign in his article “The Zemstvo Campaign and p. 
 485 Machism —a reactionary, subjectivist-idealist philosophical trend which became widespread in Western Europe in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. 
 It was founded by Ernst Mach, an Austrian physicist and philosopher, and Richard Avenarius, a German philosopher. 
 Machism was particularly dangerous to the working class as a trend of bourgeois idealist philosophy, for while professing to be opposed to idealism it referred to contemporary natural science, a circumstance which gave it a “scientific” semblance. 
 In Russia, Machist influence was strong among a section of the Social-Demo-cratic intelligentsia. 
 It was particularly widespread among the Menshevik intellectuals, such as N. 
 Valentinov and P. 
 S. 
 Yushke-vich. 
 Some Bolshevik writers, too, including V. 
 Bazarov, A. 
 Bog-danov and A. 
 V. 
 Lunacharsky, adopted the standpoint of Machism. 
 Under the pretence of developing Marxism, the Russian Machists tried to revise the fundamental tenets of Marxist philosophy. 
 Lenin in his book Materialism and Empirio-criticism exposed the reactionary nature of Machism. 
 He upheld Marxist philosophyagainst revisionist attacks and elaborated dialectical and histori-cal materialism in the new historical conditions. 
 The defeat of Machism struck a powerful blow at the ideological positions of the Mensheviks, otzovists and god-builders.

 Petersburg during ameeting at Witmer’s private gymnasium. 
 The pupils were suspect-ed by the secret police of being members of an illegal political group.
