 I. 
 Lenin wrote between December 30, 1920, and August 14, 1921. 
 These works show Lenin’s Party and government activ-ities—his leadership of the Bolshevik Party and guidance of the Soviet state—in the period of transition from thepolicy of War Communism to the New Economic Policy. 
 The volume contains his articles and speeches, “The Trade Unions, the Present Situation and Trotsky’s Mis-takes”, “The Party Crisis”, and the report and summing-up. 
 speech on the role and tasks of the trade unions at the Second All-Russia Congress of Miners, his pamphlet, OnceAgain on the Trade Unions, the Current Situation and theMistakes of Trotsky and Bukharin, his “Speech Deliveredat the Fourth All-Russia Congress of Garment Workers”,and others. 
 These works substantiate the forms and methods of the Party’s work among the masses in the new conditions of transition to the peace-time effort of economic recovery,and define the role and tasks of the trade unions as a schoolof communism in socialist construction. 
 In his uncompro-mising struggle against the Workers ‘ Opposition, DemocraticCentralists and Left Communists, who tried to erode the Party and undermine the dictatorship of the proletariat and the Party’s leading role in the Soviets and trade unions,Lenin directed his main blow at the Trotskyites as thecore of the anti-Party groupings. 
 A considerable section of the volume consists of reports, speeches and draft resolutions at the Tenth Party Congress. 
 Among them are the report and summing-up speech on the political work of the Central Committee of the R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
);speech on the trade unions; report and summing up speech on the tax in kind; “Preliminary Draft Resolution of the Tenth Congress of the R. 
C. 
P. 
 on Party Unity”; “Prelimin-ary Draft Resolution of the Tenth Congress of the R. 
C. 
P. 
 on the Syndicalist and Anarchist Deviation in Our Party”;report and summing-up speech on Party unity and theanarcho-syndicalist deviation, etc. 
 These works character-ise Lenin’s struggle for the Party’s unity, the consolidationof the alliance between the working class and the peasantry on the new economic basis, and the strengthening of the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
 The volume includes Lenin’s well-known pamphlet, The Tax in Kind (The Significance of the New Policy andIts Conditions), in which he gave an all-round substantiationof the New Economic Policy as a special policy of the proletarian state securing the possibility of laying the foundation of a socialist economy, and as a way for thesuccessful construction of socialism. 
 This question is alsodealt with in other works appearing in this volume, includ-ing “Report on the Tax in Kind Delivered at a Meeting ofSecretaries and Responsible Representatives of R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
) Cells of Moscow and Moscow Gubernia”, report and sum-ming-up speech on the tax in kind at the Tenth All-RussiaConference of the R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
), and recorded speeches. 
 There are many works showing Lenin’s direction of national economic planning and organisation. 
 Among themare “Integrated Economic Plan”; draft Instructions of the Council of Labour and Defence to Local Soviet Bodies, “Speech on Local Economic Bodies Delivered at a Sittingof the All-Russia Central Executive Committee”, “SpeechDelivered at the Third All-Russia Food Conference”, andothers. 
 A number of speeches and documents in the volume show Lenin’s activity in building up the state apparatus, and in training and drawing the broad mass of workingpeople into government. 
 They are: “Instructions of theCentral Committee to Communists Working in the People’sCommissariat for Education”, “The Work of the People’sCommissariat for Education ”, “Speech Delivered at an Enlarged Conference of Moscow Metalworkers”, “Speech at a Plenary Meeting of the Moscow Soviet of Workers’and Peasants’ Deputies”, Speech Delivered at the All-Russia Congress of Transport Workers”, “To the Petrograd City Conference of Non-Party Workers”, and others. 
 The volume contains Lenin’s theses, reports and speeches at the Third Congress of the Communist International:theses for a report on the tactics of the R. 
C. 
P. 
 at the ThirdCongress of the Communist International; speech on theItalian question, speech in defence of the tactics of theCommunist International, and report on the tactics of the R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
). 
 These documents define the tasks of the Communist Parties and their methods of winning over theworking people. 
 Nine items in this volume are included in the Collected Works for the first time. 
 They are: “Rough Draft of ThesesConcerning the Peasants”, “Preliminary Draft Resolution on Improving the Condition of Workers and Needy Peas-ants”, speech and proposal on the fuel question at theTenth Congress of the R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
), report on concessions ata meeting of the Communist group of the All-Russia CentralCouncil of Trade Unions, “Letter on Oil Concessions”, and“To the Trade Union Committee and All Workers of the First State Motor Works”. 
 “Draft Resolution on Questions of the New Economic Policy” is also published in full forthe first time. 
 All these works deal with the rehabilitationand development of the national economy and improve-ment of the working people’s living standards. 
 Another document published here for the first time is the decree of the Council of People’s Commissars “Concerning the Conditions Ensuring the Research Work of AcademicianI. 
 P. 
 Pavlov and His Associates”. 
 This decree shows theconcern of the Communist Party and the Soviet Governmentfor the development of Soviet science.

 LENIN May 19/FL00631 THE TRAD E UNIONS , THE PRESEN T SITUATION AND TROTS KY’S MISTAKE S1 SPEECH DELIVERED AT A JOINT MEETING OF COMMUNIST DELEGATES TO THE EIGHTH CONGRESS OF SOVIETS, COMMUNIST MEMBERS OF THE ALL-RUSSIA CENTRAL COUNCIL OF TRADE UNIONS AND COMMUNIST MEMBERS OF THE MOSCOW CITY COUNCIL OF TRADE UNIONS DECEMBER 30, 1920 Comrades, I must first of all apologise for departing from the rules of procedure, for anyone wishing to take part in the debate should have heard the report, the secondreport and the speeches. 
 I am so unwell, unfortunately,that I have been unable to do this. 
 But I was able yesterdayto read the principal printed documents and to prepare my remarks. 
 This departure from the rules will naturally cause you some inconvenience; not having heard the otherspeeches, I may go over old ground and leave out whatshould be dealt with. 
 But I had no choice. 
 My principal material is Comrade Trotsky’s pamphlet, The Role and Tasks of the Trade Unions . 
 When I compare it with the theses he submitted to the Central Committee,and go over it very carefully, I am amazed at the numberof theoretical mistakes and glaring blunders it contains. 
How could anyone starting a big Party discussion on thisquestion produce such a sorry excuse for a carefully thoughtout statement? Let me go over the main points which, I think, contain the original fundamental theoretical errors. 
 Trade unions are not just historically necessary; they are historically inevitable as an organisation of the indus-trial proletariat, and, under the dictatorship of the prole-tariat, embrace nearly the whole of it. 
 This is basic, butComrade Trotsky keeps forgetting it; he neither appreciates it nor makes it his point of departure, all this while dealing with “The Role and Tasks of the Trade Unions”, a subjectof infinite compass. 
 It follows from what I have said that the trade unions have an extremely important part to play at every step of the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
 But what is their part? I find that it is a most unusual one, as soon as I delve intothis question, which is one of the most fundamental theo-retically. 
 On the one hand, the trade unions, which take inall industrial workers, are an organisation of the ruling,dominant, governing class, which has now set up a dicta-torship and is exercising coercion through the state. 
 But it is not a state organisation; nor is it one designed forcoercion, but for education. 
 It is an organisation designedto draw in and to train; it is, in fact, a school: a schoolof administration, a school of economic management,a school of communism. 
 It is a very unusual type of school, because there are no teachers or pupils; this is an extremely unusual combination of what has necessarily come downto us from capitalism, and what comes from the ranks ofthe advanced revolutionary detachments, which you mightcall the revolutionary vanguard of the proletariat. 
 To talkabout the role of the trade unions without taking these truths into account is to fall straight into a number of errors. 
 Within the system of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the trade unions stand, if I may say so, between the Partyand the government. 
 In the transition to socialism thedictatorship of the proletariat is inevitable, but it is notexercised by an organisation which takes in all industrial workers. 
 Why not? The answer is given in the theses of the Second Congress of the Communist International onthe role of political parties in general. 
 I will not go intothis here. 
 What happens is that the Party, shall we say,absorbs the vanguard of the proletariat, and this vanguardexercises the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
 The dictator-ship cannot be exercised or the functions of government performed without a foundation such as the trade unions. 
These functions, however, have to be performed throughthe medium of special institutions which are also of a newtype, namely, the Soviets. 
 What are the practical conclu-sions to be drawn from this peculiar situation? They are, on the one hand, that the trade unions are a link between the vanguard and the masses, and by their daily workbring conviction to the masses, the masses of the class which alone is capable of taking us from capitalism to communism. 
 On the other hand, the trade unions are a “reservoir” of the state power. 
 This is what the trade unions are in the period of transition from capitalism to commu-nism. 
 In general, this transition cannot be achieved withoutthe leadership of that class which is the only class capital-ism has trained for large-scale production and which aloneis divorced from the interests of the petty proprietor. 
 But the dictatorship of the proletariat cannot be exercised through an organisation embracing the whole of that class,because in all capitalist countries (and not only over here,in one of the most backward) the proletariat is still sodivided, so degraded, and so corrupted in parts (by imperial-ism in some countries) that an organisation taking in the whole proletariat cannot directly exercise proletarian dictatorship. 
 It can be exercised only by a vanguard thathas absorbed the revolutionary energy of the class. 
 Thewhole is like an arrangement of cogwheels. 
 Such is thebasic mechanism of the dictatorship of the proletariat,and of the essentials of transition from capitalism to commu-nism. 
 From this alone it is evident that there is something fundamentally wrong in principle when Comrade Trotskypoints, in his first thesis, to “ideological confusion”, andspeaks of a crisis as existing specifically and particularlyin the trade unions. 
 If we are to speak of a crisis, we cando so only after analysing the political situation. 
 It is Trotsky who is in “ideological confusion”, because in this key question of the trade unions’ role, from the standpointof transition from capitalism to communism, he has lostsight of the fact that we have here a complex arrangementof cogwheels which cannot be a simple one; for the dictator-ship of the proletariat cannot be exercised by a mass prole-tarian organisation. 
 It cannot work without a number of “transmission belts” running from the vanguard to themass of the advanced class, and from the latter to the massof the working people. 
 In Russia, this mass is a peasant one. 
There is no such mass anywhere else, but even in the mostadvanced countries there is a non-proletarian, or a not entirely proletarian, mass. 
 That is in itself enough to produce ideological confusion. 
 But it’s no use Trotsky’spinning it on others. 
 When I consider the role of the trade unions in production, find that Trotsky’s basic mistake lies in his always dealing with it “in principle”, as a matter of “general principle”. 
 All his theses are based on “general principle”,an approach which is in itself fundamentally wrong, quiteapart from the fact that the Ninth Party Congress saidenough and more than enough about the trade unions’role in production, 2 and quite apart from the fact that in his own theses Trotsky quotes the perfectly clear statements of Lozovsky and Tomsky, who were to be his “whippingboys” and an excuse for an exercise in polemics. 
 It turnsout that there is, after all, no clash of principle, and thechoice of Tomsky and Lozovsky, who wrote what Trotskyhimself quotes, was an unfortunate one indeed. 
 However hard we may look, we shall not find here any serious diver-gence of principle. 
 In general, Comrade Trotsky’s greatmistake, his mistake of principle, lies in the fact that byraising the question of “principle” at this time he is drag-ging back the Party and the Soviet power. 
 We have, thankheaven, done with principles and have gone on to practical business. 
 We chatted about principles—rather more than we should have—at the Smolny. 
 Today, three years later,we have decrees on all points of the production problem,and on many of its components; but such is the sad fate ofour decrees: they are signed, and then we ourselves forgetabout them and fail to carry them out. 
 Meanwhile, argu-ments about principles and differences of principle are invented. 
 I shall later on quote a decree dealing with thetrade unions’ role in production, a decree all of us, includ-ing myself, I confess, have forgotten. 
 The actual differences, apart from those I have listed, really have nothing to do with general principles. 
 I have had to enumerate my “differences” with Comrade Trotsky because, with such a broad theme as “The Role and Tasksof the Trade Unions”, he has, I am quite sure, made anumber of mistakes bearing on the very essence of the dic-tatorship of the proletariat. 
 But, this apart, one may well ask,why is it that we cannot work together, as we so badly need to do? It is because of our different approach to the mass, the different way of winning it over and keeping in touch with it. 
 That is the whole point. 
 And this makes the trade union a very peculiar institution, which is set up under capitalism, which inevitably exists in the transition from capitalism to communism, and whose future is a question mark. 
 The time when the trade unions are actually calledinto question is a long way off: it will be up to our grand-children to discuss that. 
 What matters now is how toapproach the mass, to establish contact with it and winit over, and how to get the intricate transmission system working (how to run the dictatorship of the proletariat). 
 Note that when I speak of the intricate transmission systemI do not mean the machinery of the Soviets. 
 What itmay have in the way of intricacy of transmission comesunder a special head. 
 I have only been considering, in prin-ciple and in the abstract, class relations in capitalist society, which consists of a proletariat, a non-proletarian mass of working people, a petty bourgeoisie and a bourgeoisie. 
This alone yields an extremely complicated transmissionsystem owing to what has been created by capitalism, quiteapart from any red-tape in the Soviet administrativemachinery. 
 And that is the main point to be considered in analysing the difficulties of the trade unions’ “task”. 
 Let me say this again: the actual differences do not liewhere Comrade Trotsky sees them but in the question ofhow to approach the mass, win it over, and keep in touchwith it. 
 I must say that had we made a detailed, even ifsmall-scale, study of our own experience and practices, we should have managed to avoid the hundreds of quite unnecessary “differences” and errors of principle in whichComrade Trotsky’s pamphlet abounds. 
 Some of his theses,for instance, polemicise against “Soviet trade-unionism”. 
As if we hadn’t enough trouble already, a new bogey hasbeen invented. 
 Who do you think it is? Comrade Ryazanov, of all people. 
 I have known him for twenty odd years. 
 You have known him less than that, but equally as well by hiswork. 
 You are very well aware that assessing slogans is notone of his virtues, which he undoubtedly has. 
 Shall wethen produce theses to show that “Soviet trade-unionism”is just something that Comrade Ryazanov happened to say with little relevance? Is that being serious? If it is, we shall end up with having “Soviet trade-unionism”, “Soviet anti-peace-signing”, and what not! A Soviet “ism” could be invented on every single point. 
 (Ryazanov : “Soviet anti-Brestism. 
”) Exactly, “Soviet anti-Brestism”. 
 While betraying this lack of thoughtfulness, Comrade Trotsky falls into error himself. 
 He seems to say that ina workers’ state it is not the business of the trade unionsto stand up for the material and spiritual interests of theworking class. 
 That is a mistake. 
 Comrade Trotsky speaks of a “workers’ state”. 
 May I say that this is an abstraction. 
 It was natural for us to write about a workers’ state in1917; but it is now a patent error to say: “Since this is aworkers’ state without any bourgeoisie, against whom thenis the working class to be protected, and for what purpose?”The whole point is that it is not quite a workers’ state. 
 That is where Comrade Trotsky makes one of his main mis-takes. 
 We have got down from general principles to practi-cal discussion and decrees, and here we are being draggedback and prevented from tackling the business at hand. 
This will not do. 
 For one thing, ours is not actually aworkers’ state but a workers’ and peasants’ state. 
 And a lot depends on that. 
 ( Bukharin : “What kind of state? A workers’ and peasants’ state?”) Comrade Bukharin backthere may well shout “What kind of state? A workers’ andpeasants’ state?” I shall not stop to answer him. 
 Anyonewho has a mind to should recall the recent Congress ofSoviets, 3 and that will be answer enough. 
 But that is not all. 
 Our Party Programme—a document which the author of the ABC of Communism knows very well—shows that ours is a workers’ state with a bureau-cratic twist to it . 
 We have had to mark it with this dismal, shall I say, tag. 
 There you have the reality of the transi-tion. 
 Well, is it right to say that in a state that has taken this shape in practice the trade unions have nothing to protect, or that we can do without them in protecting thematerial and spiritual interests of the massively organisedproletariat? No, this reasoning is theoretically quite wrong. 
It takes us into the sphere of abstraction or an ideal weshall achieve in 15 or 20 years’ time, and I am not so sure that we shall have achieved it even by then. 
 What we actually have before us is a reality of which we have agood deal of knowledge, provided, that is, we keep our heads, and do not let ourselves be carried away by intellec-tualist talk or abstract reasoning, or by what may appear to be “theory” but is in fact error and misapprehension of the peculiarities of transition. 
 We now have a stateunder which it is the business of the massively organisedproletariat to protect itself, while we, for our part, mustuse these workers’ organisations to protect the workersfrom their state, and to get them to protect our state. 
 Both forms of protection are achieved through the peculiar interweaving of our state measures and our agreeing or“coalescing” with our trade unions. 
 I shall have more to say about this coalescing later on. 
 But the word itself shows that it is a mistake to conjureup an enemy in the shape of “Soviet trade-unionism”, for “coalescing” implies the existence of distinct things that have yet to be coalesced: “coalescing” implies the need to be able to use measures of the state power to protectthe material and spiritual interests of the massively organ-ised proletariat from that very same state power. 
 When the coalescing has produced coalescence and integration , we shall meet in congress for a business-like discussion of actual experience, instead of “disagreements” on principleor theoretical reasoning in the abstract. 
 There is an equallylame attempt to find differences of principle with Com-rades Tomsky and Lozovsky, whom Comrade Trotsky treatsas trade union “bureaucrats”—I shall later on say which side in this controversy tends to be bureaucratic. 
 We all know that while Comrade Ryazanov may love a slogan,and must have one which is all but an expression of princi-ple, it is not one of Comrade Tomsky’s many vices. 
 I think,therefore, that it would be going a bit too far to challengeComrade Tomsky to a battle of principles on this score (as Comrade Trotsky has done). 
 I am positively astonished at this. 
 One would have thought that we had grown upsince the days when we all sinned a great deal in the wayof factional, theoretical and various other disagreements—although we naturally did some good as well. 
 It is time westopped inventing and blowing up differences of principle and got down to practical work. 
 I never knew that Tomsky was eminently a theoretician or that he claimed to be one;it may be one of his failings, but that is something else again. 
 Tomsky, who has been working very smoothly with the trade union-movement, must in his position provide a reflection of this complex transition—whether he should do so consciously or unconsciously is quite anothermatter and I am not saying that he has always done itconsciously—so that if something is hurting the mass, andthey do not know what it is, and he does not know what itis (applause , laughter ) but raises a howl, I say that is not a failing but should be put down to his credit. 
 I am quite sure that Tomsky has many partial theoretical mistakes. 
And if we all sat down to a table and started thoughtfullywriting resolutions or theses, we should correct them all;we might not even bother to do that because productionwork is more interesting than the rectifying of minute theoretical disagreements. 
 I come now to “industrial democracy”, shall I say, for Bukharin’s benefit. 
 We all know that everyone has hisweak points, that even big men have little weak spots,and this also goes for Bukharin. 
 He seems to be incapableof resisting any little word with a flourish to it. 
 He seemed to derive an almost sensuous pleasure from writing the reso-lution on industrial democracy at the Central CommitteePlenum on December 7. 
 But the closer I look at this“industrial democracy”, the more clearly I see that it is half-baked and theoretically false. 
 It is nothing but a hodge-podge. 
 With this as an example, let me say once again, at a Party meeting at least: “Comrade N. 
 I. 
 Bukharin, the Republic, theory and you yourself will benefit from lessverbal extravagance. 
” ( Applause . 
) Industry is indispensa-ble. 
 Democracy is a category proper only to the politicalsphere. 
 There can be no objection to the use of this wordin speeches or articles. 
 An article takes up and clearly expresses one relationship and no more. 
 But it is quite strange to hear you trying to turn this into a thesis, andto see you wanting to coin it into a slogan, uniting the“ayes” and the “nays”; it is strange to hear you say, likeTrotsky, that the Party will have “to choose between twotrends”. 
 I shall deal separately with whether the Party must do any “choosing” and who is to blame for putting the Party in this position of having to “choose”. 
 Thingsbeing what they are, we say: “At any rate, see that you choose fewer slogans, like ‘industrial democracy’, which contain nothing but confusion and are theoretically wrong. 
” Both Trotsky and Bukharin failed to think out this term theoretically and ended up in confusion. 
 “Industrial democ-racy” suggests things well beyond the circle of ideas withwhich they were carried away. 
 They wanted to lay greateremphasis and focus attention on industry. 
 It is one thingto emphasise something in an article or speech; it is quite another to frame it into a thesis and ask the Party to choose, and so I say: cast your vote against it, because it isconfusion. 
 Industry is indispensable, democracy is not. 
 In-dustrial democracy breeds some utterly false ideas. 
 The ideaof one-man management was advocated only a little whileago. 
 We must not make a mess of things and confuse people: how do you expect them to know when you want democracy, when one-man management, and when dictatorship. 
 Buton no account must we renounce dictatorship either—I hearBukharin behind me growling: “Quite right. 
” ( Laughter . 
 Applause . 
) But to go on. 
 Since September we have been talking about switching from the principle of priority to that of equalisation, and we have said as much in the resolutionof the all-Party conference, which was approved by theCentral Committee. 
 4 The question is not an easy one, because we find that we have to combine equalisation withpriority, which are incompatible. 
 But after all we do have some knowledge of Marxism and have learned how and when opposites can and must be combined; and what is mostimportant is that in the three and a half years of our revolu-tion we have actually combined opposites again and again. 
 The question obviously requires thoughtfulness and circumspection. 
 After all, we did discuss these questions of principle at those deplorable plenary meetings of the Central Committee *—which yielded the groups of seven and eight, and Comrade Bukharin’s celebrated “buffergroup” 6—and we did establish that there was no easy tran-*The reference is to the November and December plenary meet-ing of the Central Committee in 1920.

 sition from the priority principle to that of equalisation. 
 We shall have to put in a bit of effort to implement the decision of the September Conference. 
 After all, these oppo-site terms can be combined either into a cacophony ora symphony. 
 Priority implies preference for one industryout of a group of vital industries because of its greaterurgency. 
 What does such preference entail? How great canit be? This is a difficult question, and I must say that it will take more than zeal to solve it; it may even take more than a heroic effort on the part of a man who is possiblyendowed with many excellent qualities and who will dowonders on the right job; this is a very peculiar matter andcalls for the correct approach. 
 And so if we are to raise thisquestion of priority and equalisation we must first of all give it some careful thought, but that is just what we fail to find in Comrade Trotsky’s work; the further he goes inrevising his original theses, the more mistakes he makes. 
Here is what we find in his latest theses: “The equalisation line should be pursued in the sphere of consump-tion , that is, the conditions of the working people’s existence as individuals. 
 In the sphere of production , the principle of priority will long remain decisive for us”... (thesis 41, p. 
 31 of Trotsky’spamphlet). 
 This is a real theoretical muddle. 
 It is all wrong. 
 Pri-ority is preference, but it is nothing without preferencein consumption. 
 If all the preference I get is a couple of ounces of bread a day I am not likely to be very happy. 
 The preference part of priority implies preference in con-sumption as well. 
 Otherwise, priority is a pipe dream,a fleeting cloud, and we are, after all, materialists. 
 Theworkers are also materialists; if you say shock work, theysay, let’s have the bread, and the clothes, and the beef. 
 That is the view we now take, and have always taken, in discussing these questions time without number withreference to various concrete matters in the Council ofDefence, 7 when one would say: “I’m doing shock work”, and would clamour for boots, and another: “I get the boots,otherwise your shock workers won’t hold out, and all your priority will fizzle out. 
” We find, therefore, that in the theses the approach to equalisation and priority is basically wrong. 
 What is more, it is a retreat from what has actually been achieved and tested in practice. 
 We can’t have that; it will lead to no good. 
 Then there is the question of “coalescing”. 
 The best thing to do about “coalescing” right now is to keep quiet. 
Speech is silver, but silence is golden. 
 Why so? It is becausewe have got down to coalescing in practice; there is nota single large gubernia economic council, no major depart-ment of the Supreme Economic Council, the People’s Commissariat for Communications, etc. 
, where somethingis not being coalesced in practice . 
 But are the results all they should be? Ay, there’s the rub. 
 Look at the waycoalescence has actually been carried out, and what it has produced. 
 There are countless decrees introducing coales-cence in the various institutions. 
 But we have yet to make a business-like study of our own practical experience; wehave yet to go into the actual results of all this; we have yetto discover what a certain type of coalescence has producedin a particular industry, what happened when memberX of the gubernia trade union council held post Y in the gubernia economic council, how many months he was at it, etc. 
 What we have not failed to do is to invent a disagree-ment on coalescence as a principle, and make a mistakein the process, but then we have always been quick at thatsort of thing; but we were not up to the mark when it cameto analysing and verifying our own experience. 
 When we have congresses of Soviets with committees not only on the application of the better-farming law in the variousagricultural areas but also on coalescence and its resultsin the Saratov Gubernia flour-milling industry, the Petro-grad metal industry, the Donbas coal industry, etc. 
, andwhen these committees, having mustered the facts, declare: “We have made a study of so and so”, then I shall say: “Now we have got down to business, we have finally grownup. 
” But could anything be more erroneous and deplorablethan the fact that we are being presented with “theses”splitting hairs over the principle of coalescence, after wehave been at it for three years? We have taken the path of coalescence, and I am sure it was the right thing to do, but we have not yet made an adequate study of theresults of our experience. 
 That is why keeping quiet is the only common sense tactics on the question of coalescence. 
 A study must be made of practical experience. 
 I have signed decrees and resolutions containing instructions onpractical coalescence, and no theory is half so importantas practice. 
 That is why when I hear: “Let’s discuss ‘coa-lescence’”, I say: “Let’s analyse what we have done. 
”There is no doubt that we have made many mistakes. 
 It may well be that a great part of our decrees need amend-ing. 
 I accept that, for I am not in the least enamoured ofdecrees. 
 But in that case let us have some practical pro-posals as to what actually has to be altered. 
 That wouldbe a business-like approach. 
 That would not be a waste oftime. 
 That would not lead to bureaucratic projecteering. 
 But I find that that is exactly what’s wrong with Trotsky’s “Practical Conclusions”, Part VI of his pamphlet. 
 He saysthat from one-third to one-half of the members of the All-Russia Central Council of Trade Unions and the Presidiumof the Supreme Economic Council should serve on bothbodies, and from one-half to two-thirds, on the collegiums, etc. 
 Why so? No special reason, just “rule of thumb”. 
 It is true, of course, that rule of thumb is frequently usedto lay down similar proportions in our decrees, but thenwhy is it inevitable in decrees? I hold no brief for all decreesas such and have no intention of making them appearbetter than they actually are. 
 Quite often rule of thumb is used in them to fix such purely arbitrary proportions as one-half or one-third of the total number of members,etc. 
 When a decree says that, it means: try doing it thisway, and later on we shall assess the results of your “try-out”. 
 We shall later sort out the results. 
 After sorting them out, we shall move on. 
 We are working on coalescence and we expect to improve it because we are becoming more efficient and practical-minded. 
 But I seem to have lapsed into “production propaganda”. 
 That can’t be helped. 
 It is a question that needs dealingwith in any discussion of the role of the trade unions inproduction. 
 My next question will therefore be that of production propaganda. 
 This again is a practical matter and weapproach it accordingly. 
 Government agencies have already been set up to conduct production propaganda. 
 I can’t tell whether they are good or had; they have to be tested and there’s no need for any “theses” on this subject at all. 
 If we take a general view of the part trade unions have to play in industry, we need not, in this question of democ-racy, go beyond the usual democratic practices. 
 Nothingwill come of such tricky phrases as “industrial democracy”,for they are all wrong. 
 That is the first point. 
 The second is production propaganda. 
 The agencies are there. 
 Trotsky’s theses deal with production propaganda. 
 That is quiteuseless, because in this case theses are old hat. 
 We do notknow as yet whether the agencies are good or bad. 
 But wecan tell after testing them in action. 
 Let us do somestudying and polling. 
 Assuming, let us say, that a congress has 10 committees with 10 men on each, let us ask: “You have been dealing with production propaganda, haven’tyou? What are the results?” Having made a study of this,we should reward those who have done especially well,and discard what has proved unsuccessful. 
 We do havesome practical experience; it may not be much but it is there; yet we are being dragged away from it and back to these “theses on principles ”. 
 This looks more like a “reac-tionary” movement than “trade unionism”. 
 There is then the third point, that of bonuses. 
 Here is the role and task of the trade unions in production:distribution of bonuses in kind . 
 A start on it has been made. 
 Things have been set in motion. 
 Five hundred thou-sand poods of grain had been allocated for the purpose,and one hundred and seventy thousand has been distribut-ed. 
 How well and how correctly, I cannot tell. 
 TheCouncil of People’s Commissars was told that they werenot making a good job of this distribution, which turned out to be an additional wage rather than a bonus. 
 This was pointed out by officials of the trade unions and thePeople’s Commissariat for Labour. 
 We appointed a commis-sion to look into the matter but that has not yet been done. 
One hundred and seventy thousand poods of grain hasbeen given away, but this needs to be done in such a way as to reward those who display the heroism, the zeal, the talent, and the dedication of the thrifty manager, in a word,all the qualities that Trotsky extols. 
 But the task now is not to extol this in theses but to provide the bread and the beef. 
 Wouldn’t it be better, for instance, to deprive one category of workers of their beef and give it as a bonus to workers designated as “shock” workers? We do notrenounce that kind of priority. 
 That is a priority we need. 
Let us take a closer look at our practices in the applicationof priority. 
 The fourth point is disciplinary courts. 
 I hope Comrade Bukharin will not take offence if I say that without disci-plinary courts the role of the trade unions in industry,“industrial democracy”, is a mere trifle. 
 But the fact isthat there is nothing at all about this in your theses. 
 “Greatgrief!” is therefore the only thing that can be said aboutTrotsky’s theses and Bukharin’s attitude, from the stand-point of principle, theory and practice. 
 I am confirmed in this conclusion when I say to myself: yours is not a Marxist approach to the question. 
 This quiteapart from the fact that there are a number of theoreticalmistakes in the theses It is not a Marxist approach to theevaluation of the “role and tasks of the trade unions”, because such a broad subject cannot be tackled without giving thought to the peculiar political aspects of the pre-sent situation. 
 After all, Comrade Bukharin and I did sayin the resolution of the Ninth Congress of the R. 
C. 
P. 
on trade unions that politics is the most concentratedexpression of economics. 
 If we analysed the current political situation, we might say that we were going through a transition period withina transition period. 
 The whole of the dictatorship of theproletariat is a transition period, but we now have, youmight say, a heap of new transition periods: the demobili-sation of the army, the end of the war, the possibility of having a much longer breathing space in peace than before, and a more solid transition from the war front to the labourfront. 
 This—and this alone—is causing a change in theattitude of the proletarian class to the peasant class. 
 Whatkind of change is it? Now this calls for a close examination,but nothing of the sort follows from your theses. 
 Until we have taken this close look, we must learn to wait. 
 The people are overweary, considerable stocks that had to beused for certain priority industries have been so used; the proletariat’s attitude to the peasantry is undergoing a change. 
 The war weariness is terrible, and the needs have increased, but production has increased insufficiently or not at all. 
 On the other hand, as I said in my reportto the Eighth Congress of Soviets, our application of coer-cion was correct and successful whenever we had beenable to back it up from the start with persuasion. 
 I mustsay that Trotsky and Bukharin have entirely failed to take account of this very important consideration. 
 Have we laid a sufficiently broad and solid base of per-suasion for all these new production tasks? No, indeed,we have barely started doing it. 
 We have not yet made themasses a party to them. 
 Now I ask you, can the massestackle these new assignments right away? No, they cannot, because while there is now no need for special propaganda on the question of, say, whether Wrangel the landowner shouldbe overthrown or whether any sacrifices should be sparedfor the purpose, we have just started to work on this questionof the role of the trade unions in production, and I meanthe business aspect of the matter and not the question of “principle”, the reasoning about “Soviet trade-unionism” and such like trifles; we have just set up the agency forproduction propaganda, but we have as yet no experience. 
We have introduced the payment of bonuses in kind, butwe lack the experience. 
 We have set up the disciplinarycourts, but we are not yet aware of the results. 
 Still, from the political standpoint it is the preparedness of the masses that is crucial. 
 Has the question been prepared, studied,weighed, and considered from this angle? No, far from it. 
And that is a basic, deep-going and dangerous politicalmistake, because if ever there was need to act accordingto the rule of measuring your cloth seven times before cut-ting it once, it is in this question. 
 We find instead that the cutting has been started in earnest without a singlemeasure having been taken. 
 We are told that “the Partymust choose between two trends”, but the false slogan of“industrial democracy” was invented without a singlemeasuring. 
 We must try to understand the meaning of this slogan, especially in the present political situation, when themasses are confronted with bureaucratic practices in visual form, and when we have the question itself on the agenda. 
 Comrade Trotsky says in his theses that on the question of workers’ democracy it remains for the Congress to “enter it unanimously in the record”. 
 That is not correct. 
 Thereis more to it than an entry in the record; an entry in therecord fixes what has been fully weighed and measured,whereas the question of industrial democracy is far fromhaving been fully weighed, tried and tested. 
 Just think how the masses may interpret this slogan of “industrial democracy”. 
 “We, the rank and file who work among the masses, say that there is need for new blood, that things must becorrected and the bureaucrats ousted, and here you arebeating about the bush, talking about getting on with pro-duction and displaying democracy in achieving success in production; we refuse to get on with production under sucha bureaucratic set-up of central and other boards, we wanta different one. 
” You have not given the masses a chanceto discuss things, to see the point, and to think it over;you have not allowed the Party to gain fresh experience but are already acting in haste, overdoing it, and produc-ing formulas which are theoretically false. 
 Just think howthis mistake will be further amplified by unduly zealousfunctionaries! A political leader is responsible not onlyfor the quality of his leadership but also for the acts of thosehe leads. 
 He may now and again be unaware of what they are about, he may often wish they had not done some-thing, but the responsibility still falls on him. 
 I now come to the November 9 and December 7 plenary meetings of the Central Committee, which gave expressionto all these mistakes in action, rather than in logical cate-gories, premises and theoretical reasoning. 
 This threw the Central Committee into confusion; it is the first time this has happened in our Party’s history, in time of revo-lution, and it is dangerous. 
 The crux was that there wasa division, there was the “buffer” group of Bukharin,Preobrazhensky and Serebryakov, which did the most harmand created the most confusion. 
 You will recall the story of Glavpolitput 8 and Tsektran. 
9 The resolution of the Ninth Congress of the R. 
C. 
P. 
 in April 1920 said that Glavpolitput was being set up as a “tempo-rary” institution, and that conditions should be brought back to normal “ as soon as possible ”. 
 In September you read, “Return to normal conditions”. 
 * The plenary meeting was held in November (November 9), and Trotsky cameup with his theses and ideas about trade-unionism. 
 How-ever fine some of his points about production propagandamay be, he should have been told that all this was neitherhere nor there, quite beside the mark, and a step backward; it is something the C. 
C. 
 should not be dealing with at present. 
 Bukharin says: “It is very good. 
” It may be verygood, but that is no answer to the question. 
 After a heateddebate, a resolution is adopted by 10 to 4 saying in a politeand comradely way that Tsektran has itself “already gotdown to ... strengthening and developing methods of proletarian democracy within the union”. 
 It adds that Tsektran must “take an active part in the general workof the All-Russia Central Council of Trade Unions, beingincorporated in it on an equal footing with other tradeunion bodies”. 
 What is the gist of the Central Committee’s decision? It is obviously this: “Comrades of Tsektran! You must do more than go through the motions of carrying out Congressand C. 
C. 
 decisions, you must actually do so to help alltrade unions by your work, wipe out every trace of red-tape, favouritism, arrogance, the we-are-better-than-youattitude, and boasts of being richer and getting more aid. 
” We then get down to brass tacks. 
 A commission is set up, and the names of its members are published. 
 Trotskywalks out, refuses to serve on the commission, and disruptsits work. 
 What are his reasons? There is only one. 
 Lutovinovis apt to play at opposition. 
 That is true, and that also goes for Osinsky. 
 Frankly speaking, it is not a pleasant *See Izvestia of the C.

 further believes that there has been a great improvement in thegrave situation in the transport workers’ unions, which producedGlavpolitput and Politvod, 10 as temporary levers for assisting and organising the work. 
 Therefore, incorporation of these organisations in the union, as union agencies being adapted to and absorbed by the union apparatus, can and must now proceed. 
” game. 
 But do you call that a reason? Osinsky was making an excellent job of the seed campaign. 
 The thing to do was to work with him, in spite of his “opposition campaign”, for this business of disrupting the work of a commissionis bureaucratic, un-Soviet, un-socialist, incorrect andpolitically harmful. 
 Such methods are doubly incorrectand politically harmful at a time when there is need toseparate the wheat from the chaff within the “opposition”. 
 When Osinsky conducts an “opposition campaign”, I tell him: “This is a harmful campaign”, but it is a pleasureto see him conduct the seed campaign. 
 I shall not denythat, like Ishchenko and Shlyapnikov, Lutovinov is makinga mistake in his “opposition campaign”, but that is no reasonto disrupt the work of a commission. 
 What did the commission in fact signify? It signified transition to practical work from intellectualist talkabout sterile disagreements. 
 What the commission was dueto discuss and deal with was production propaganda,bonuses, and disciplinary courts. 
 It was then that ComradeBukharin, the head of the “buffer group”, together with Preobrazhensky and Serebryakov, seeing the Central Com-mittee dangerously divided, set out to create a buffer, onethat I find difficult to describe in parliamentary terms. 
If I could draw cartoons as well as Comrade Bukharindoes, I would depict him as a man pouring a bucket ofkerosene on the flames, and give the following caption: “Buffer kerosene”. 
 Comrade Bukharin wanted to create something, and his intentions were no doubt most sincereand entirely in the “buffer” spirit. 
 But the buffer failed tomaterialise; the upshot was that he failed to take accountof the political situation and, what is more, made sometheoretical mistakes. 
 Should all such disputes have been brought up for broad discussion? Was it worth going into these trifles? Wasit worth wasting the few precious weeks before a Partycongress? We could have used the time to analyse and studythe question of bonuses, disciplinary courts and coalescence. 
Those are the questions we could have given a practical solution to in the C. 
C. 
 commission. 
 If Comrade Bukharin wished to create a buffer, instead of giving a display ofbarking up the wrong tree, he should have demanded and insisted that Comrade Trotsky remained on the commis-sion. 
 If he had said and done that, we should have been on the right track, with the commission looking into the practical aspects of such things as one-man management,democracy, appointees, etc. 
 But to go on. 
 By December (the December 7 Plenary Meeting), we were already faced with this flare-up of thewatermen, which intensified the conflict, and as a result there were now eight votes in the Central Committee to our seven. 
 Comrade Bukharin, in an effort to bring abouta “reconciliation” through the use of his “buffer”, hastilywrote the “theoretical” part of the December plenum’sresolution, but with the commission a shambles, nothing,of course, could come of it. 
 Where did Glavpolitput and Tsektran err? Certainly not in their use of coercion; that goes to their credit. 
Their mistake was that they failed to switch to normaltrade union work at the right time and without conflict,as the Ninth Congress of the R. 
C. 
P. 
 required; they failedto adapt themselves to the trade unions and help them by meeting them on an equal footing. 
 Heroism, zeal, etc. 
, are the positive side of military experience; red-tape andarrogance are the negative side of the experience of theworst military types. 
 Trotsky’s theses, whatever his inten-tions, do not tend to play up the best, but the worst inmilitary experience. 
 It must be borne in mind that a political leader is responsible not only for his own policy but also for the acts of those he leads. 
 The last thing I want to tell you about—something I called myself a fool for yesterday—is that I had altogetheroverlooked Comrade Rudzutak’s theses. 
 His weak pointis that he does not speak in ringing tones; he is not an im-pressive or eloquent speaker. 
 He is liable to be overlooked. 
 Unable to attend the meetings yesterday, I went throughmy material and found a printed leaflet issued for the FifthAll-Russia Trade Union Conference, which was-held fromNovember 2 to 6, 1920. 
 11 It is called: The Tasks of the Trade Unions in Production . 
 Let me read it to you, it is not long. 
 FIFTH ALL -RUSSIA TRADE UNION CONFERENCE T h e t a s k s o f t h e t r a d e u n i o n s i n p r o d u c t i o n (THESES OF COMRADE RUDZUTAK’S REPORT) 1. 
 Immediately after the October Revolution, the trade unions proved to be almost the only bodies which, while exercising workers’ control , were able and bound to undertake the work of organising and managing production . 
 In that early period of the Soviet power, no state apparatus for the management of the national economy had yet been set up, while sabotage on the part of factory owners and senior technicians brought the working class squarely up against the taskof safeguarding industry and getting the whole of the country’s eco-nomic apparatus back into normal running order. 
 2. 
 In the subsequent period of the Supreme Economic Council’s work, when a considerable part of it consisted in liquidating private enterprises and organising state management to run them, the trade unions carried on this work jointly and side by side with the state eco-nomic management agencies . 
 This parallel set-up was explained and justified by the weakness of the state agencies; historically it was vindicated by the establish-ment of full contact between the trade unions and the economic management agencies. 
 3. 
The centre of gravity in the management of industry and the drafting of a production programme shifted to these agencies as a result of their administration, the gradual spread of their control over production and management and the co-ordination of the severalparts. 
 In view of this, the work of the trade unions in organising production was reduced to participation in forming the collegiums of chief administrations, central boards, and factory managements.

 At the present time, we are once again squarely faced with the question of establishing the closest possible ties between the economic agencies of the Soviet Republic and the trade unions, forthe best use must be made of every working individual, and the whole mass of producers must be induced to take a conscious part in production, for the state apparatus of economic management,gradually gaining in size and complexity, has been transformed into a huge bureaucratic machine which is out of all proportion to the scale of industry, and is inevitably impelling the trade unions to takedirect part in organising production not only through its men in the economic agencies but also as an organised whole. 
 5. 
 While the Supreme Economic Council’s point of departure in drawing up an overall production programme is the availability of the material elements of production (raw materials, fuel, the state of machinery, etc. 
), the trade unions must look at it from the stand-point of organising labour for the tasks of production and its best use. 
 Therefore, the overall production programme , in whole and in part , must be drawn up with the participation of the trade unions in order to combine the use of the material resources of production and 6. 
 Only if the whole mass of those engaged in production con-sciously take a hand in establishing real labour discipline, fighting deserters from the labour front, etc. 
, can these tasks be fulfilled. 
 Bureaucratic methods and orders will not do; it must be brought home to each participant in production that his production tasks are appropriate and important; that each must take a hand not only in fulfilling his assignments, but also play an intelligent part incorrecting any technical and organisational defects in the sphere of production. 
 The tasks of the trade unions in this sphere are tremendous. 
 They must teach their members in each shop and in each factory to react to and take account of all defects in the use of manpower arising from improper handling of technical means or unsatisfactory management. 
 The sum total of the experience gained by separate enterprises and industry as a whole must be used to combat red-tape, bureaucratic practices and carelessness. 
 7. 
 In order to lay special emphasis on the importance of these production tasks, they must be organisationally worked into current operations. 
 As the economic departments of the trade unions, which are being set up in pursuance of the decision of the Third All-Russia Congress, extend their activity, they must gradually explain and define the nature of all trade union work. 
 Thus, in the present socialconditions, when all of production is geared to the satisfaction of the working people’s needs, wage rates and bonuses must be closely tied in with and must depend on the extent to which the production planis fulfilled . 
 Bonuses in kind and partial payment of wages in kind must be gradually transformed into a system of workers ’ supply which depends on the level of labour productivity. 
 8. 
 Trade union work on these lines would, on the one hand, put an end to the existence of parallel bodies (political departments , etc. 
) and, on the other, restore the close ties between the masses and theeconomic management agencies. 
 9. 
 After the Third Congress, the trade unions largely failed to carry out their programme for participation in economic construction,owing, first, to the military conditions , and second, to their organi-sational weakness and isolation from the administrative and practical work of the economic bodies. 
 10. 
 In view of this, the trade unions should set themselves the following immediate practical tasks: a) the most active participation in solving production and management problems; b) direct partici-pation, with the respective economic agencies, in setting up competent administrative bodies; c) careful consideration of the various types of management bodies , and their influence on production; d) unfail-ing participation in working out and laying down economic plans and production programmes; e) organisation of labour in accordance with the economic priorities; f) development of an extensive organi-sation for production agitation and propaganda. 
 11. 
 The economic departments of the trade unions and of their organisations must be actually transformed into powerful andexpeditious levers for the trade unions’ systematic participation in 12. 
 In the matter of providing workers with steady material supplies, the trade unions must shift their influence onto the distribu-tion bodies of the Commissariat for Food , both local and central, taking a practical and business-like part and exercising controI in all the distributive bodies, and paying special attention to the activity of central and gubernia workers ’ supply commissions . 
 13. 
 In view of the fact that the narrow departmental interests of some chief administrations, central boards, etc. 
, have plunged theso-called “priority” into a state of utter confusion, the trade unionsmust everywhere uphold the real order of economic priorities and review the existing system so as to determine them in accordance with the actual importance of the various industries and the availabilityof material resources in the country. 
 14. 
 Special attention must be given to the so-called model group of factories to help them set an example through the organisationof efficient management, labour discipline and trade union activities. 
 15. 
 In labour organisation, apart from the introduction of a harmonious wage-rate system and the overhaul of output rates, thetrade unions should take a firm hand in fighting the various forms of labour desertion (absenteeism, lateness, etc. 
). 
 The disciplinary courts, which have not received due attention until now, must be turned into a real means of combating breaches of proletarian labour discipline. 
 16. 
 The economic departments must be entrusted with the ful-filment of these tasks and also the drafting of a practical plan forproduction propaganda and a number of measures to improve theeconomic condition of the workers. 
 It is necessary, therefore, to author-ise the economic department of the All-Russia Central Council of Trade Unions to call a special All-Russia Conference of Economic Departments in the near future to discuss the practical problems of economic construction in connection with the world of state economicagencies. 
 I hope you see now why I called myself names. 
 There you have a platform, and it is very much better than theone Comrade Trotsky wrote after a great deal of thinking,and the one Comrade Bukharin wrote (the December 7 Plenum resolution) without any thinking at all. 
 All of us members of the Central Committee who have been out oftouch with the trade union movement for many yearswould profit from Comrade Rudzutak’s experience, andthis also goes for Comrade Trotsky and Comrade Bukharin. 
The trade unions have adopted this platform. 
 We all entirely forgot about the disciplinary courts, but “industrial democracy”, without bonuses in kind ordisciplinary courts, is nothing but empty talk. 
 I make a comparison between Rudzutak’s theses and those submitted by Trotsky to the Central Committee. 
 At the end of thesis 5, I read: “... a reorganisation of the unions must be started right away, that is, a selection of functionaries must be above all made from precisely that angle”.... 
 There you have an example of the real bureaucratic approach: Trotsky and Krestinsky selecting the trade union “functionaries”! Let me say this once again: here you have an explanation of Tsektran’s mistake. 
 It was not wrong to use pressure;that goes to its credit. 
 It made the mistake of failing tocope with the general tasks of all the trade unions, of failing to act itself and to help all the trade unions to employ the disciplinary comrades’ courts more correctly,swiftly and successfully. 
 When I read about the discipli-nary courts in Comrade Rudzutak’s theses it occurred tome that there might be a decree on this matter. 
 And infact there was. 
 It is the Regulations Governing Workers’ Disciplinary Comrades’ Courts, issued on November 14, 1919 ( Collection of Statutes No. 
 537). 
 The trade unions have the key role in these courts. 
 I don’t know how good these courts are, how well theyfunction, and whether they always function. 
 A study ofour own practical experience would be a great deal more useful than anything Comrades Trotsky and Bukharin have written. 
 Let me end by summing up everything there is on the question. 
 I must say that it was a great mistake to put upthese disagreements for broad Party discussion and theParty Congress. 
 It was a political mistake. 
 We should have had a business-like discussion in the commission, and only there, and would have in that case moved forward;as it is we are sliding back, and shall keep sliding back toabstract theoretical propositions for several weeks, insteadof dealing with the problem in a business-like manner. 
Personally, I am sick and tired of it, and quite apart from my illness, it would give me great pleasure to get away from it all. 
 I am prepared to seek refuge anywhere. 
 The net result is that there are a number of theoretical mistakes in Trotsky’s and Bukharin’s theses: they contain a number of things that are wrong in principle. 
 Politically, the whole approach to the matter is utterly tactless. 
 Comrade Trotsky’s “theses” are politically harmful. 
 The sum andsubstance of his policy is bureaucratic harassment of thetrade unions. 
 Our Party Congress will, I am sure, condemnand reject it. 
 ( Prolonged , stormy applause . 
) Published in pamphlet form Published according to the pamphlet in 1921 text collated with the verbatim re-port edited by Lenin THE PARTY CRISIS The pre-Congress discussion is in full swing. 
 Minor differ-ences and disagreements have grown into big ones, whichalways happens when someone persists in a minor mistake and balks at its correction, or when those who are making a big mistake seize on the minor mistake of one or morepersons. 
 That is how disagreements and splits always grow. 
 That is how we “grew up” from minor disagreements to syndical-ism, which means a complete break with communism and an inevitable split in the Party if it is not healthy and strong enough to purge itself of the malaise. 
 We must have the courage to face the bitter truth. 
 The Party is sick. 
 The Party is down with the fever. 
 The wholepoint is whether the malaise has affected only the “feverishupper ranks”, and perhaps only those in Moscow, or the whole organism. 
 And if the latter is the case, is it capable of healing itself completely within the next few weeks,before the Party Congress and at the Party Congress,making a relapse impossible, or will the malaise lingerand become dangerous? What is it that needs to be done for a rapid and certain cure? All members of the Party must make a calm and painstaking study of 1) the essence of the disagreements and 2) the development of the Party struggle. 
 A studymust be made of both, because the essence of the disagree-ments is revealed, clarified and specified (and very oftentransformed as well) in the course of the struggle , which, passing through its various stages, always shows, at every stage, a different line-up and number of combatants, different positions in the struggle, etc. 
 A study must be made of both, and a demand made for the most exact, printed documents that can be thoroughly verified. 
 Only a hopeless idiot will believe oral statements. 
 If no documents are available, there must be an examination of witnesses onboth or several sides and the grilling must take place in the presence of witnesses. 
 Let me outline the essence of the disagreements and the successive stages in the struggle, as I see them. 
 Stage one. 
 The Fifth All-Russia Trade Union Conference November 2-6. 
 The battle is joined. 
 Trotsky and Tomskyare the only Central Committee “combatants”. 
 Trotskylets drop a “catchy phrase” about “shaking up” the tradeunions. 
 Tomsky argues very heatedly. 
 The majority ofthe Central Committee members are on the fence. 
 The serious mistake they (and I above all) made was that we “overlooked” Rudzutak’s theses, The Tasks of the Trade Unions in Production , adopted by the Fifth Conference. 
 That is the most important document in the whole of the controversy. 
 Stage two. 
 The Central Committee Plenum of November 9. 
 Trotsky submits his “draft theses”, The Trade Unions and Their Future Role , advocating the “shake-up” policy camouflaged or adorned with talk of a “severe crisis”gripping the trade unions, and their new tasks and methodsTomsky, strongly supported by Lenin, considers that inview of Tsektran’s irregularities and bureaucratic excesses it is the “shake-up” that is the crux of the whole controversy. 
 In the course of it, Lenin makes a number of obviouslyexaggerated and therefore mistaken “attacks”, which pro-duces the need for a “buffer group”, and this is made up often members of the Central Committee (the group includesBukharin and Zinoviev, but neither Trotsky nor Lenin). 
 It resolves “not to put the disagreements up for broad discussion”, and, cancelling Lenin ’s report (to the trade unions), appoints Zinoviev as the rapporteur and instructshim to “present a business-like and non-controversialreport. 
 Trotsky’s theses are rejected. 
 Lenin’s theses are adopted. 
 In its final form, the resolution is adopted by ten votes to four (Trotsky, Andreyev, Krestinsky and Rykov). 
 Andthis resolution advocates “sound forms of the militarisa- /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR tion of labour”, condemns “the degeneration of centralism and militarised forms of work into bureaucratic practices, petty tyranny, red-tape”, etc. 
 Tsektran is instructed to “take a more active part in the general work of the All-Russia Central Council of Trade Unions, being incorporated init on an equal footing with other trade union bodies”. 
 The Central Committee sets up a trade union commission and elects Comrade Trotsky to it. 
 He refuses to work on the commission, magnifying by this step alone his original mistake, which subsequently leads to factionalism. 
 Withoutthat step, his mistake (in submitting incorrect theses)remained a very minor one, such as every member of theCentral Committee, without exception, has had occasionto make. 
 Stage three. 
 The conflict between the water transport workers and Tsektran in December. 
 The Central CommitteePlenary Meeting of December 7. 
 It is no longer Trotskyand Lenin, but Trotsky and Zinoviev who are the chief“combatants”. 
 As chairman of the trade union commission,Zinoviev inquires into the December dispute between the water transport workers and Tsektran. 
 The Central Commit-tee Plenary Meeting of December 7. 
 Zinoviev makes a prac-tical proposal for an immediate change in the compositionof Tsektran. 
 This is opposed by a majority of the CentralCommittee. 
 Rykov goes over to Zinoviev’s side. 
 Bukharin’sresolution—the substantive part of which is three-quarters in favour of the water transport workers, while the preamble, rejecting the proposal to “reconstruct” the trade unions “from above” (§3), approves of the celebrated “industrialdemocracy” (§5)—is adopted. 
 Our group of Central Com-mittee members is in the minority, being opposed to Bukha-rin’s resolution chiefly because we consider the “buffer” a paper one; for Trotsky’s non-participation in the trade union commission’s work actually implies a continuationof the struggle and its transfer outside the Central Com-mittee. 
 We propose that the Party Congress be convenedon February 6, 1921. 
 That is adopted. 
 The postpone-ment to March 6 was agreed to later, on the demand of the outlying areas. 
 Stage four. 
 The Eighth Congress of Soviets. 
 On December 25, Trotsky issues his “platform pamphlet”, The Role and Tasks of the Trade Unions . 
 From the standpoint of formal democracy, Trotsky had an uncontested right to issue his platform, for on December 24 the Central Com-mittee had permitted free discussion. 
 From the standpointof revolutionary interest, this was blowing up the mistakeout of all proportion and creating a faction on a faulty platform. 
 The pamphlet quotes from the Central Committeeresolution of December 7 only that part which refers to “industrial democracy” but does not quote what was said against “reconstruction from above”. 
 The buffer createdby Bukharin on December 7 with Trotsky’s aid was wreckedby Trotsky on December 25. 
 The pamphlet from beginningto end is shot through with the “shake-up” spirit. 
 Apartfrom its intellectualist flourishes (“production atmosphere”, “industrial democracy”), which are wrong in theory and in practice fall within the concept, ambit and tasks ofproduction propaganda, it fails to indicate any “new” “tasks or methods ” that were to gild or camouflage or justify the “shake-up”. 
 Stage five. 
 The discussion before thousands of respon-sible Party workers from all over Russia at the R. 
C. 
P. 
 group of the Eighth Congress of Soviets on December 30. 
The controversy flares up to full blast. 
 Zinoviev and Leninon one side, Trotsky and Bukharin on the other. 
 Bukharinwants to play the “buffer, but speaks only against Leninand Zinoviev, and not a word against Trotsky. 
 Bukharin reads out an excerpt from his theses (published on January 16), but only that part which says nothing about the rupturewith communism and the switch to syndicalism. 
 Shlyapni-kov (on behalf of the Workers’ Opposition 12) reads out the syndicalist platform, which Trotsky had demolished beforehand (thesis 16 of his platform) and which (partly, perhaps, for that reason) no one is inclined to take seriously. 
 In my opinion, the climax of the whole discussion of December 30 was the reading of Comrade Rudzutak’s theses. 
Indeed, Comrades Trotsky and Bukharin, far from beingable to object to them, even invented the legend that the“best part” of the theses had been drawn up by members of Tsektran —Holtzmann, Andreyev and Lyubimov. 
 And that is why Trotsky humorously and amiably twitted Leninon his unsuccessful “diplomacy”, by which, he said, Lenin had wanted to “call off or disrupt” the discussion, and find a “lightning conductor”, “accidentally catching hold of Tsektran instead of the lightning conductor”. 
 The legend was exploded that very day, December 30, by Rudzutak, who pointed out that Lyubimov “did notexist” on the All-Russia Central Council of Trade Unions,that in its presidium Holtzmann had voted against thesetheses, and that they had been drawn up by a commission consisting of Andreyev, Tsiperovich and himself. 
 13 But let us for a moment assume that Comrades Trotsky and Bukharin’s legend is true. 
 Nothing so completelydefeats them as such an assumption. 
 For what is theconclusion if the “Tsektranites” had inserted their “new”ideas into Rudzutak’s resolution, if Rudzutak had accepted them, if all the trade unions had adopted this resolution (November 2-6!), and if Bukharin and Trotsky have nothingto say against it? It is that all of Trotsky’s disagreements are artificial, that neither he nor the “Tsektranites” have any “new tasks or methods”, and that everything practical and substantive had been said, adopted and decided upon by the trade unions, even before the question was raised in the Central Committee . 
 If anyone ought to be taken thoroughly to task and “shaken up”, it is not the All-Russia Central Council ofTrade Unions but the Central Committee of the R. 
C. 
P. 
, forhaving “overlooked” Rudzutak’s theses, a mistake which allowed an altogether empty discussion to flare up. 
 There is nothing to cover up the mistake of the Tsektranites (which is not an excessive one but is, in essence, a very commonone, consisting in some exaggeration of bureaucracy). 
 Whatis more, it needs to be rectified, and not covered up, toneddown or justified. 
 That’s all there is to it. 
 I summed up the substance of Rudzutak’s theses on December 30 in four points: 1) Ordinary democracy (withoutany exaggerations, without denying the Central Com-mittee’s right of “appointment”, etc. 
, but also withoutany obstinate defence of the mistakes and excesses of certain“appointees”, which need to be rectified); 2) Production propaganda (this includes all that is practical in clumsy, ridiculous, theoretically wrong “formulas” like “industrialdemocracy”, “production atmosphere”, etc. 
). 
 We have established a Soviet institution , the All-Russia Production Propaganda Bureau. 
 We must do everything to support it and not spoil production work by producing ... bad theses . 
 That’s all there is to it; 3) Bonuses in kind and 4) Discipli-nary comrades’ courts. 
 Without Points 3 and 4, all talkabout “the role and tasks in production”, etc. 
, is empty,highbrow chatter; and it is these two points that are omittedfrom Trotsky’s “platform pamphlet”. 
 But they are in Rudzutak’s theses. 
 While dealing with the December 30 discussion, I must correct another mistake of mine. 
 I said: “Ours is not actuallya workers’ state but a workers’ and peasants’ state. 
”Comrade Bukharin immediately exclaimed: ‘What kind ofa state?” In reply I referred him to the Eighth Congress of Soviets, which had just closed. 
 I went back to the report of that discussion and found that I was wrong and ComradeBukharin was right. 
 What I should have said is: “A workers’state is an abstraction. 
 What we actually have is a workers’state, with this peculiarity, firstly, that it is not the workingclass but the peasant population that predominates in the country, and, secondly, that it is a workers’ state with bureaucratic distortions. 
” Anyone who reads the wholeof my speech will see that this correction makes nodifference to my reasoning or conclusions. 
 Stage six. 
 The Petrograd organisation issues an “Appeal to the Party” against Trotsky’s platform, and the Mos-cow Committee issues a counter-statement ( Pravda , January 13 14). 
 This is a transition from the struggle between factions, formed from above, to the intervention of lower organisations. 
It is a big step towards recovery. 
 Curiously enough, theMoscow Committee noticed the “dangerous” side of the Petrograd organisation ’s issuing a platform, but refused to notice the dangerous side of Comrade Trotsky’s forming a faction on December 25! Some wags have said this is “buffer”(one-eyed) blindness. 
 Stage seven. 
 The trade union commission concludes its work and issues a platform (a pamphlet, entitled Draft Decision of the Tenth Congress of the R. 
C. 
P. 
 on the Role and Tasks of the Trade Unions , 15 dated January 14 and signed by nine members of the Central Committee— Zinoviev, Stalin, Tomsky, Rudzutak, Kalinin, Kamenev, Petrovsky, Artyom and Lenin, and also by Lozovsky, a member of the trade union commission; Comrades Shlyap-nikov and Lutovinov seem to have “fled” to the Workers’Opposition). 
 It was published in Pravda on January 18, with the following additional signatures: Schmidt, Tsipe-rovich and Milyutin. 
 On January 16, Pravda carries the Bukharin platform (signed: “On behalf of a group of comrades, Bukharin, Larin, Preobrazhensky, Serebryakov, Sokolnikov, Yakov-leva”) and the Sapronov platform (signed: “A group ofcomrades standing for democratic centralism”, Bubnov,Boguslavsky, Kamensky, Maximovsky, Osinsky, Rafail,Sapronov). 
 16 The enlarged meeting of the Moscow Commit-tee on January 17 was addressed by spokesmen for these platforms, and also by the “Ignatovites”17 (theses published in Pravda on January 19 and signed by Ignatov, Orekhov, Korzinov, Kuranova, Burovtsev, Maslov). 
* What we find here is, on the one hand, increased solidarity (for the platform of the nine Central Committee members is in complete accord with the decision of the Fifth All-Russia Conference of Trade Unions); and, on the other,confusion and disintegration, with Bukharin and Co. 
’stheses being an all-time low in ideological disintegration. 
 We have here one of those “turns” which in the old daysMarxists used to call “not so much historical as hysterical”. 
 Thesis 17 says: “At the present time, these nominations must be made mandatory ” (that is, the trade unions’ nominations to the respective “chief administrations andcentral boards”). 
 This is a clean break with communism and a transi-tion to syndicalism. 
 It is, in essence, a repetition of Shlyapnikov’s “unionise the state” slogan, and means transferring the Supreme Economic Council apparatus *Incidentally, the Party should demand that every “platform” be issued with the full signatures of all the comrades responsiblefor it. 
 This demand is met by the “Ignatovites” and the “Saprono-vites” but not by the “Trotskyites”, the “Bukharinites” and the “Shlyapnikovites”, who refer to anonymous comrades allegedly responsible for their platforms. 
 piecemeal to the respective trade unions. 
 To say, “I pro-pose mandatory nominations”, is exactly the same as saying, “I appoint”. 
 Communism says: The Communist Party, the vanguard of the proletariat, leads the non-Party workers’ masses,educating, preparing, teaching and training the masses(“school ” of communism)—first the workers and then the peasants—to enable them eventually to concentrate in their hands the administration of the whole national economy. 
 Syndicalism hands over to the mass of non-Party work-ers, who are compartmentalised in the industries, themanagement of their industries (“the chief administrationsand central boards”), thereby making the Party superfluous,and failing to carry on a sustained campaign either in training the masses or in actually concentrating in their hands the management of the whole national economy . 
 The Programme of the R. 
C. 
P. 
 says: “The trade unions should eventually arrive ” (which means that they are not yet there or even on the way) “at a de facto concentration in their hands” (in their , that is, the hands of the trade unions, that is, the hands of the fully organised masses ; anyone will see how far we have still to go even to the very first approachesto this de facto concentration) ... concentration of what? “of the whole administration of the whole national economy,as a single economic entity” thence, not branches of industry,or even industry as a whole, but industry plus agriculture, etc. 
 Are we anywhere near to actually concentrating the management of agriculture in the hands of the trade unions?). 
The R. 
C. 
P. 
 Programme then speaks of the “ties” betweenthe “central state administration” and the “broad massesof toilers”, and of the “ participation of the trade unions in running the economy”. 
 Why have a Party, if industrial management is to be appointed (“mandatory nomination”) by the trade unionsnine-tenths of whose members are non-Party workers?Bukharin has talked himself into a logical, theoretical andpractical implication of a split in the Party, or, rather, abreakaway of the syndicalists from the Party. 
 Trotsky, who had been “chief” in the struggle, has now been “outstripped” and entirely “eclipsed” by Bukharin,who has thrown the struggle into an altogether new balance by talking himself into a mistake that is much more serious than all of Trotsky’s put together. 
 How could Bukharin talk himself into a break with communism? We know how soft Comrade Bukharin is; itis one of the qualities which endears him to people, whocannot help liking him. 
 We know that he has been ribbedfor being as “soft as wax”. 
 It turns out that any “unprin-cipled” person, any “demagogue” can leave any mark he likes on this “soft wax”. 
 The sharp words in quotation marks were used by Comrade Kamenev, during the January17 discussion, and he had a perfect right to do so. 
 But, ofcourse, neither Kamenev nor anyone else would dream ofattributing or reducing it all to unprincipled demagogy . 
 On the contrary, there is an objective logic in factional struggles which inevitably leads even the best of men—if they persist in their mistaken attitude—into a state whichdiffers little if at all from unprincipled demagogy. 
 Thatis the lesson of the entire history of factional wars (forexample, the alliance of the Vperyodists and the Mensheviksagainst the Bolsheviks 18). 
 That is why we must make a study not only of the nature of the disagreements in the abstract, but also of their concrete development and changeat the various stages of the struggle. 
 This developmentwas summed up in the January 17 discussion. 
 19 Neither the “shake-up” nor the “new production tasks” can anylonger be advocated (because all the efficient and sensible ideas went into Rudzutak’s theses). 
 The alternative then is to find what Lassalle called “the physical strength ofmind” (and character) to admit the mistake, rectify it andturn over this page of the history of the R. 
C. 
P. 
, or—tocling to the remaining allies, no matter who they are, and“ignore” the principles altogether. 
 There remain only the adherents of “democracy” ad nauseam . 
 And Bukharin is sliding down towards them and syndicalism. 
 While we are slowly absorbing what was sound in the “democratic” Workers’ Opposition, Bukharin has to clingto what is unsound . 
 On January 17, Comrade Bumazhny, a prominent Tsektranite, or Trotskyite, expressed his readiness to accept Bukharin’s syndicalist proposals. 
 The “Sapronovites” have gone so far as to insist in the samethesis (3) on a “profound crisis” and a “bureaucratic necrosis” of the trade unions, while proposing, as being “abso-lutely” necessary, the “extension of the trade unions’ rights in production” ... probably because of their “bureaucratic necrosis”? Can this group be taken seriously? They hadheard the talk about the role of the trade unions in produc-tion, and wishing to outshout the others, blurted out:“extension of rights” on the occasion of “bureaucraticnecrosis”. 
 You need read no more than the first few lines of their “practical” proposals: “The presidium of the Supreme Economic Council shall be nominated by the All-RussiaCentral Council of Trade Unions and confirmed by the All-Russia Central Executive Committee. 
” And what is theirdemocratic position in “principle”? Listen to this (thesis 2): “They [Zinoviev and Trotsky] * in fact express two trends within the same group of ex-militarisers of the economy . 
” Taken seriously, this is Menshevism and Socialist-Revo-lutionarism at their worst. 
 But Sapronov, Osinsky and Co. 
should not be taken seriously, when, before every Partycongress (“every blessed time on this very same spot”),these, I believe, superlative workers have a sort of paroxys-mal seizure and try to outshout the others (the “champion shouter” faction) and solemnly make a hash of things. 
 The“Ignatovites” try to keep up with the “Sapronovites”. 
It is, of course, quite permissible (specially before a congress)for various groups to form blocs (and also to go vote chasing). 
But this should he done within the framework of communism (and not syndicalism) and in such a way as to avoid being ridiculous. 
 Who is the highest bidder? Promisers of more“rights” to non-Party people, unite on the occasion of thecongress of the Russian Communist Party!... Our platform up to now has been: Do not defend but rectify the bureaucratic excesses. 
 The fight against bureauc-racy is a long and arduous one. 
 Excesses can and must be rectified at once. 
 It is not those who point out harmfulexcesses and strive to rectify them but those who resistrectification that undermine the prestige of the militaryworkers and appointees. 
 Such were the excesses of certain *Interpolations in square brackets (within passages quoted by Lenin) have been introduced by Lenin, unless otherwise indicated. 
— Ed. 
 Tsektranites who, however, will continue to be (and have been) valuable workers. 
 There is no need to harass the trade unions by inventing disagreements with them, when they themselves have decided upon and accepted all that is new,business-like and practical in the tasks of the trade unionsin production. 
 On this basis, let us vigorously work togetherfor practical results. 
 We have now added to our platform the following: We must combat the ideological discord and the unsound elements of the opposition who talk themselves into repu-diating all “militarisation of industry”, and not only the“appointments method”, which has been the prevailing oneup to now, but all “appointments”, that is, in the lastanalysis, repudiating the Party’s leading role in relation to the non-Party masses. 
 We must combat the syndicalist deviation, which will kill the Party unless it is entirelycured of it. 
 The Entente * capitalists will surely try to take advantage of our Party’s malaise to mount another invasion, and theSocialist-Revolutionaries, to hatch plots and rebellions. 
 We need have no fear of this because we shall all unite as one man, without being afraid to admit the malaise, butrecognising that it demands from all of us a greater disci-pline, tenacity and firmness at every post.

 THE SECON D ALL-RUSSI A CONGRESS OF MINERS20 1 REPORT ON THE ROLE AND TASKS OF THE TRADE UNIONS DELIVERED ON JANUARY 23 AT A MEETING OF THE COMMUNIST GROUP OF THE CONGRESS The morbid character of the question of the role and tasks of the trade unions is due to the fact that it took the form of a factional struggle much too soon. 
 This vast, boundlessquestion should not have been taken up in such haste, asit was done here, and I put the chief blame on ComradeTrotsky for all this fumbling haste and precipitation. 
 Allof us have had occasion to submit inadequately prepared theses to the Central Committee and this is bound to go on because all our work is being done in a rush. 
 This is nota big mistake, for all of us have had to act in haste. 
 Takenby itself, it is a common mistake and is unavoidable becauseof the extremely difficult objective conditions. 
 All the morereason, therefore, to treat factional, controversial issues with the utmost caution; for in such matters even not very hot-headed persons—something, I’m afraid, I cannot sayabout my opponent—may all too easily fall into this error. 
To illustrate my point, and to proceed at once to the heartof the matter, let me read you the chief of Trotsky’s theses. 
 In his pamphlet, towards the end of thesis No. 
 12, he writes: “We observe the fact that as economic tasks move into the foreground, many trade unionists take an ever more aggressive and uncompromising stand against the prospect of ‘coalescence’ and the practical conclusions that follow from it. 
 Among them we findComrades Tomsky and Lozovsky. 
 “What is more, many trade unionists, balking at the new tasks and methods, tend to cultivate in their midst a spirit of corporativeexclusiveness and hostility for the new men who are being drawn into the given branch of the economy, thereby actually fostering the survivals of craft-unionism among the organized workers. 
” I could quote many similar passages from Trotsky’s pamphlet. 
 I ask, by way of factional statement: Is it becom-ing for such an influential person, such a prominent leader, to attack his Party comrades in this way? I am sure that99 per cent of the comrades, excepting those involved inthe quarrel, will say that this should not be done. 
 I could well understand such a statement if Comrades Tomsky and Lozovsky were guilty, or could be suspected of being guilty, of, say, having flatly refused to sign the Brest Peace Treaty, or of having flatly opposed the war. 
The revolutionary interest is higher than formal democracy. 
But it is fundamentally wrong to approach the subject insuch haste at the present moment. 
 It won’t do at all. 
 Thispoint says that many trade unionists tend to cultivate in their midst a spirit of hostility and exclusiveness. 
 What does that mean? What sort of talk is this? Is it the rightkind of language? Is it the right approach? I had earliersaid that I might succeed in acting as a “buffer” and stayingout of the discussion, because it is harmful to fight withTrotsky—it does the Republic, the Party, and all of us a lot of harm—but when this pamphlet came out, I felt I had to speak up. 
 Trotsky writes that “many trade unionists tend to cul-tivate a spirit of hostility for the new men”. 
 How so? Ifthat is true, those who are doing so should be named. 
 Sincethis is not done, it is merely a shake-up, a bureaucratic approach to the business. 
 Even if there is a spirit of hostility for the new men, one should not say a thing like that. 
 Trotskyaccuses Lozovsky and Tomsky of bureaucratic practices. 
I would say the reverse is true. 
 It is no use reading anyfurther because the approach has spoiled everything; hehas poured a spoonful of tar into the honey, and no matter how much honey he may add now, the whole is already spoiled. 
 Whose fault is it that many trade unionists tend to cul-tivate a spirit of hostility for the new men? Of course, abufferite or a Tsektranite will say it is the trade unionists’. 
 The fact is that in this case idle fancy and invention have accumulated like the snowdrifts in the storm outside. 
But, comrades, we must sort things out and get at the sub-stance. 
 And it is that a spirit of hostility has been aroused among the masses by a number of tactless actions. 
 My opponent asserts that certain people have been cultivating a spirit of hostility. 
 This shows that the question is seen in the wrong light. 
 We must sort things out. 
 The All-RussiaConference was held in November, and that is where the“shake-up” catchword was launched. 
 Trotsky was wrong inuttering it. 
 Politically it is clear that such an approachwill cause a split and bring down the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
 We must understand that trade unions are not government departments, like People’s Commissariats, but comprise thewhole organised proletariat; that they are a special typeof institution and cannot be approached in this way. 
 Andwhen there arose this question of a wrong approach, latent with the danger of a split, I said: “Don’t talk about any broad discussion for the time being; go to the commissionand examine the matter carefully over there. 
” But thecomrades said: “No, we can’t do that; it is a violation ofdemocracy. 
” Comrade Bukharin went so far as to talk aboutthe “sacred slogan of workers’ democracy”. 
 Those are his very words. 
 When I read that I nearly crossed myself. 
 (Laughter . 
) I insist that a mistake always has a modest beginning and then grows up. 
 Disagreements always startfrom small things. 
 A slight cut is commonplace, but if itfesters, it may result in a fatal illness. 
 And this thing hereis a festering wound. 
 In November, there was talk about a shake-up; by December, it had become a big mistake. 
 The December Plenary Meeting of the Central Committee was against us. 
 The majority sided with Trotsky and carriedTrotsky and Bukharin’s resolution, which you must haveread. 
 But even the C. 
C. 
 members who did not sympathisewith us had to admit that the water transport workers had more right on their side than Tsektran. 
 That is a fact. 
 When I ask what Tsektran’s fault was, the answer is not thatthey had brought pressure to bear—that goes to their credit—but that they had allowed bureaucratic excesses. 
 But once you have realised that you had allowed excesses you ought to rectify them, instead of arguing against recti-fication. 
 That is all there is to it. 
 It will take decades to overcome the evils of bureaucracy. 
 It is a very difficultstruggle, and anyone who says we can rid ourselves of bureau-cratic practices overnight by adopting anti-bureaucratic platforms is nothing but a quack with a bent for fine words. 
 Bureaucratic excesses must be rectified right away. 
 We must detect and rectify them without calling bad good,or black white. 
 The workers and peasants realise that theyhave still to learn the art of government, but they are alsovery well aware that there are bureaucratic excesses, andit is a double fault to refuse to correct them. 
 This must be done in good time, as the water transport workers have pointed out, and not only when your attention is called to it. 
 Even the best workers make mistakes. 
 There are excellent workers in Tsektran, and we shall appoint them, and cor-rect their bureaucratic excesses. 
 Comrade Trotsky says thatComrades Tomsky and Lozovsky—trade unionists both— are guilty of cultivating in their midst a spirit of hostility for the new men. 
 But this is monstrous. 
 Only someone inthe lunatic fringe can say a thing like that. 
 This haste leads to arguments, platforms and accusations, and eventually creates the impression that everything isrotten. 
 You know when people fall out it only takes them a couple of days to start abusing each other’s relatives down to thetenth generation. 
 You ask: “What are you quarrellingover?” “Oh, his aunt was this, and his grandfather wasthat. 
” “I don’t mean now; how did the whole thing start?”It turns out that in the course of two days a heap of disa-greements has piled up. 
 Tsektran has allowed excesses in a number of cases, and these were harmful and unnecessary bureaucratic excesses. 
People are liable to allow excesses everywhere. 
 There aredepartments with a staff of 30,000 in Moscow alone. 
 Thatis no joke. 
 There’s something to be corrected, there’s a wall to be scaled. 
 There must be no fear, no thought of causing offence or dissension. 
 To start a factional struggle andaccuse Tomsky of cultivating among the masses a spirit ofhostility for the Tsektranites is utterly to distort the facts,absolutely to spoil all the work, and entirely to damageall relations with the trade unions. 
 But the trade unions embrace the whole proletariat. 
 If this thing is persisted in and voted on by platforms, it will lead to the downfall ofthe Soviet power. 
 If the Party falls out with the trade unions, the fault lies with the Party, and this spells certain doom for the Soviet power. 
 We have no other mainstay but the millions of proletarians, who may not be class conscious, are oftenignorant, backward and illiterate, but who, being proletari-ans, follow their own Party. 
 For twenty years they haveregarded this Party as their own. 
 Next comes a class whichis not ours, which may side with us, if we are wise and if we pursue a correct policy within our own class. 
 We have now reached the supreme moment of our revolution: wehave roused the proletarian masses and the masses of poorpeasants in the rural areas to give us their conscious support. 
No revolution has ever done this before. 
 There is no classthat can overthrow us: the majority of the proletarians and the rural poor are behind us. 
 Nothing can ruin us but our own mistakes. 
 This “but” is the whole point. 
 If wecause a split, for which we are to blame, everything willcollapse because the trade unions are not only an officialinstitution, but also the source of all our power. 
 They arethe class which the economics of capitalism has converted into the economic amalgamator, and which through its industry brings together millions of scattered peasants. 
That is why one proletarian has more strength than200 peasants. 
 That is just why Trotsky’s whole approach is wrong. 
 I could have analysed any one of his theses, but it would take me hours, and you would all be bored to death. 
 Every thesis reveals the same thoroughly wrong approach: “Manytrade unionists tend to cultivate a spirit of hostility. 
”There is a spirit of hostility for us among the trade unionrank and file because of our mistakes, and the bureaucraticpractices up on top, including myself, because it was I who appointed Glavpolitput. 
 What is to be done? Are things to be set right? We must correct Tsektran’s excesses, oncewe realise that we are a solid workers’ party, with a firmfooting, and a head on its shoulders. 
 We are not renouncingeither the method of appointment, or the dictatorship. 
 Thiswill not be tolerated by workers with a twenty years’ school-ing in Russia. 
 If we condone this mistakes we shall surely be brought down. 
 It is a mistake, and that is the root ofthe matter. 
 Trotsky says Lozovsky and Tomsky are balking at the new tasks. 
 To prove this will put a new face on the matter. 
 What are the new tasks? Here we are told: “production atmosphere”, “industrial democracy” and “role in production”. 
 I said, at the veryoutset, in the December 30 discussion, that that was nothingbut words, which the workers did not understand, and thatit was all part of the task of production propaganda. 
 We are not renouncing the dictatorship, or one-man manage-ment; these remain, I will support them, but I refuse todefend excesses and stupidity. 
 “Production atmosphere”is a funny phrase that will make the workers laugh. 
 Sayingit more simply and clearly is all part of production propa-ganda. 
 But a special institution has been set up for the purpose. 
 About enhancing the role of the trade unions in produc-tion, I replied on December 30 and in the press, and saidthat we have Comrade Rudzutak’s resolution, which wasadopted at the Conference on November 5. 
 Comrades Trotskyand Bukharin said that Tsektran had drafted this resolution. 
 Although this has been refuted, let me ask: if they had drafted it, who, in that case, is kicking? The trade unionsadopted it and Tsektran drafted it. 
 Well and good. 
 There’sno point, therefore, in quarrelling like children and raisingfactional disagreements. 
 Has Comrade Trotsky brought upany new tasks? No, he hasn’t. 
 The fact is that his new points are all worse than the old ones. 
 Comrade Trotsky is campaigning to get the Party to condemn those who arebalking at new tasks, and Tomsky and Lozovsky have beennamed as the greatest sinners. 
 Rudzutak’s resolution is couched in clearer and simpler language, and has nothing in it like “production atmos-phere” or “industrial democracy”. 
 It says clearly that every trade union member must be aware of the vital necessityof increasing productivity in the country. 
 It is put in simpleand intelligible language. 
 All this is stated better thanin Trotsky’s theses, and more fully, because bonuses in kindand disciplinary courts have been added. 
 Without the latter, all this talk of getting the transport system going and improving things is humbug. 
 Let us set up commissions anddisciplinary courts. 
 In this matter Tsektran has allowed excesses. 
 We propose calling a spade a spade: it is no use covering up excesses with new tasks; they must be corrected. 
 We have no intention of renouncing coercion. 
 No sober-minded worker would go so far as to say that we could nowdispense with coercion, or that we could dissolve the tradeunions, or let them have the whole of industry. 
 I can imag-ine Comrade Shlyapnikov blurting out a thing like that. 
 In the whole of his speech there is one excellent passage on the experience of the Sormovo Works, where, he said, absenteeism was reduced by 30 per cent. 
 This is said tobe true. 
 But I am a suspicious sort, I suggest that a com-mission be sent there to investigate and make a comparisonof Nizhni-Novgorod and Petrograd. 
 There is no need tohave a meeting about this: it can all be done in commis-sion. 
 Trotsky says that there is an attempt to prevent coa-lescence, but that is nonsense. 
 He says we must go forward. 
Indeed, if the engine is good; but if it isn’t, we must putit into reverse. 
 The Party will benefit from this, because wemust study experience. 
 Production is at a standstill, but some people have been busy producing bad theses. 
 This question requires study and experience. 
 You are trade unionists and miners who aredoing their job. 
 Now since you have taken up this question,you must inquire, demand figures, verify them over andover again—don’t take any statements for granted—andwhen you have done that, let us know the result. 
 If it is good, then go on; if it is bad, go back. 
 This means work, not talk. 
 All this should have been done at Party meetings. 
 At the Eighth Congress of Soviets, I said that we ought to have less politics. 
 When I said that I thought we wouldhave no more political mistakes, but here we are, three yearsafter the Soviet revolution, talking about syndicalism. 
 This is a shame. 
 If I had been told six months ago that I would be writing about syndicalism, I would have said that Ipreferred to write about the Donbas. 
 Now we are beingdistracted, and the Party is being dragged back. 
 A smallmistake is growing into a big one. 
 That is where ComradeShlyapnikov comes in. 
 Point 16 of Comrade Trotsky’s theses gives a correct definition of Shlyapnikov’s mistake. 
 In an effort to act the buffer, Bukharin clutched at Shlyap-nikov, but it would have been better for him to clutch at a straw. 
 He promises the unions mandatory nominations, which means they are to have the final say in appointments. 
 But that is exactly what Shlyapnikov is saying. 
 Marxists have been combating syndicalism all over the world. 
 Wehave been fighting in the Party for over twenty years, andwe have given the workers visual proof that the Party is aspecial kind of thing which needs forward-looking menprepared for sacrifice; that it does make mistakes, but corrects them; that it guides and selects men who know the way and the obstacles before us. 
 It does not deceive theworkers. 
 It never makes promises that cannot be kept. 
 Andif you skip the trade unions you will make a hash of every-thing we have achieved over the past three years. 
 ComradeBukharin, with whom I discussed this mistake, said. 
 “Com-rade Lenin, you are picking on us. 
” I take mandatory nominations to mean that they will be made under the direction of the Party’s Central Com-mittee. 
 But in that case, what are the rights we are givingthem? There will then be no chance of having a bloc. 
 Theworkers and the peasants are two distinct classes. 
 Let us talk about vesting the rights in the trade unions when elec-tricity has spread over the whole country—if we manageto achieve this in twenty years it will be incredibly quickwork, for it cannot be done quickly. 
 To talk about it beforethen will be deceiving the workers. 
 The dictatorship of theproletariat is the most stable thing in the world because it has won confidence by its deeds, and because the Party took great care to prevent diffusion. 
 What does that mean?Does every worker know how to run the state? People working in the practical sphere know that this is not true,that millions of our organised workers are going through what we always said the trade unions were, namely, a school of communism and administration. 
 When they haveattended this school for a number of years they will havelearned to administer, but the going is slow. 
 We have noteven abolished illiteracy. 
 We know that workers in touchwith peasants are liable to fall for non-proletarian slogans. 
 How many of the workers have been engaged in government? A few thousand throughout Russia and no more. 
 If we saythat it is not the Party but the trade unions that put up the candidates and administrate, it may sound very democratic and might help us to catch a few votes, but not for long. 
 It will be fatal for the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
 Read the decision of the Second Congress of the Comin-tern. 
21 Its resolutions and decisions have gone round the world. 
 The recent Socialist Congress in France revealedthat we have won a majority in a country where chauvin-ism is most virulent; we have split the Party and ejected the corrupt leaders, and we did this in opposition to thesyndicalists. 
 22 And all the best workers and leaders there have adopted our theory. 
 Even syndicalists—revolutionarysyndicalists—are siding with us all over the world. 
 I myselfhave met American syndicalists who, after a visit to this country, say: “Indeed, you cannot lead the proletariat without a Party. 
” You all know that this is a fact. 
 Andit is quite improper for the proletariat to rush into thearms of syndicalism and talk about mandatory nominationsto “all-Russia producers’ congresses”. 
 This is dangerousand jeopardizes the Party’s guiding role. 
 Only a very small percentage of the workers in the country are now organised. 
 The majority of the peasants will follow the Party becauseits policy is correct, and because, during the Brest peaceordeal, it was capable of making temporary sacrifices andretreats, which was the right thing to do. 
 Are we to throwall this away? Was it all a windfall? No, it was all won by the Party in decades of hard work. 
 Everybody believes the word of the Bolsheviks, who have had twenty yearsof Party training. 
 To govern you need an army of steeled revolutionary Communists. 
 We have it, and it is called the Party. 
 Allthis syndicalist nonsense about mandatory nominations of producers must go into the wastepaper basket. 
 To proceed on those lines would mean thrusting the Party aside andmaking the dictatorship of the proletariat in Russia impos-sible. 
 This is the view I believe it to be my Party duty toput to you. 
 It is, in my opinion, enunciated in the formof practical propositions in the platform called Draft Decision of the Tenth Congress of the R. 
C. 
P. 
 and signed by Lenin, Zinoviev, Tomsky, Rudzutak, Kalinin, Kamenev,Lozovsky, Petrovsky, Sergeyev and Stalin. 
 Lozovsky, who is not a member of the Central Committee, was included because he was on the trade union commission from which Shlyapnikov and Lutovinov, unfortunately, resigned. 
 It is up to the workers to decide whether Shlyapnikov wasright in resigning, and he will be censured, if he was wrong. 
I am convinced that all class-conscious workers will acceptthis platform and that the present disagreements in ourParty will be confined to fever at the top. 
 I am sure the workers will put them right, remain at their posts, main-tain Party discipline and join in an efficient but carefuldrive to increase production and secure full victory for ourcause.

 1, January 25, 1921 2 SPEECH CLOSING THE DISCUSSION DELIVERED AT A MEETING OF THE COMMUNIST GROUP OF THE CONGRESS JANUARY 24 Comrades, I should like to begin by speaking about who is trying to intimidate whom, and about Comrade Shlyap-nikov, who has tried hard to scare us. 
 Everyone here said Lenin was trying to raise the bogey of syndicalism. 
 This isridiculous because the very idea of using syndicalism asa bogey is ridiculous. 
 I think we ought to start with ourprogrammes, by reading the Programme of the CommunistParty to see what it says. 
 Comrades Trotsky and Shlyapnikov referred to the same passage which happens to be its Par-agraph 5. 
 Let me read it to you in full: “5. 
 The organisational apparatus of socialised industry should rely chiefly on the trade unions, which must to an ever increasingdegree divest themselves of the narrow craft-union spirit and becomelarge industrial associations, embracing the majority, and eventually all of the workers in the given branch of industry. 
” Comrade Shlyapnikov quoted this passage in his speech. 
 But, if the figures were correct, those who were managingthe organisations constituted 60 per cent, and these con-sisted of workers. 
 Furthermore, when reference is made to theProgramme, this should be done properly, bearing in mind that Party members know it thoroughly, and do not confine themselves to reading one extract, as Trotsky and Shlyap-nikov have done. 
 Comrades, there is much history to showthat the workers cannot organise otherwise than by indus-tries. 
 That is why the idea of industrial unionism has beenadopted all over the world. 
 That is for the time being, of course. 
 There is talk about the need to cast off the narrow craft-union spirit. 
 I ask you, has this been done to, say, atenth? Of course, not, is the sincere answer. 
 Why forget this? Who is it who says to the unions: “You have not yet divested yourselves of the narrow craft-union spirit, and must get on with it”? It is the R. 
C. 
P. 
 which does this in its Programme. 
 Read it. 
 To depart from this is to abandonthe Programme for syndicalism. 
 Despite the hints atLenin’s “intimidation”, the Programme is still there. 
 Youdepart from it by quoting the first part and forgetting thesecond. 
 In which direction? Towards syndicalism. 
 Let me read further: “The trade unions being, on the strength of the laws of the Soviet Republic and established practice, participants in all the local andcentral organs of industrial management, should eventually arrive at a de facto concentration in their hands of the whole administration of the whole national economy, as a single economic entity. 
” Everyone makes references to this paragraph. 
 What does it say? Something that is absolutely indisputable: “shouldeventually arrive. 
” It does not say that they are arriving. 
It does not contain the exaggeration which, once made,reduces the whole to an absurdity. 
 It says, “should even-tually arrive”. 
 Arrive where? At a de facto concentration and administration. 
 When are you due to arrive at this point? This calls for education, and it must be so organisedas to teach everyone the art of administration. 
 Now canyou say, with a clear conscience, that the trade unionsare able to fill any number of executive posts with suitablemen at any time? After all, it is not six million, but sixty thousand or, say, a hundred thousand men that you need to fill all the executive posts. 
 Can they nominate thisnumber? No, they cannot—not yet—as anyone will say whois not chasing after formulas and theses and is not misledby the loudest voices. 
 Years of educational work lie aheadfor the Party, ranging from the abolition of illiteracy to the whole round of Party work in the trade unions. 
 An enor-mous amount of work must be done in the trade unionsto achieve this properly. 
 This is exactly what it-says:“should eventually arrive at a de facto concentration in their hands of the whole administration of the whole nationaleconomy”. 
 It does not say branches of industry, as Trotsky does in his theses. 
 One of his first theses quotes the Pro-gramme correctly, but another one says: organisation ofindustry. 
 I’m afraid that is no way to quote. 
 When you are writing some theses and you want to quote the Programme, you must read it to the end. 
 Anyone who takes the trouble to read this Paragraph 5 right through and give it ten minutes’ thought will see that Shlyapnikov has departedfrom the Programme, and that Trotsky has leaped over it. 
Let’s read Paragraph 5 to the end: “The trade unions, ensuring in this way indissoluble ties between the central state administration, the national economy and the broad masses of working people, should draw the latter into direct economic management on the widest possible scale. 
 At the same time, the participation of the trade unions in economic management and their activity in drawing the broad masses into this work are the principal means of combating the bureaucratisation of the economic apparatus of the Soviet power and making possible the establishment of truly popular control over the results of production. 
” You find that you must first achieve de facto concentra-tion. 
 But what are you ensuring now? First, there are the ties within the central state administration. 
 This is a hugemachine. 
 You have not yet taught us to master it. 
 And so,you must ensure ties between the central state administra-tion—that’s one; national economy—that’s two; and themasses—that’s three. 
 Have we got those ties? Are the trade unions capable of administration? Anybody over thirty years of age with some little practical experience of Sovietorganisation will laugh at this. 
 Read the following: “At the same time, the participation of the trade unions in eco-nomic management and their activity in drawing the broad massesinto this work are the principal means of combating the bureaucrati-sation of the economic apparatus of the Soviet power and making possible the establishment of truly popular control over the resultsof production. 
” First, there is need to create ties between the central state organisations. 
 We have no intention of concealingthis malaise, and our Programme says: ensure ties with the masses, and ensure the participation of the trade unions in economic management. 
 There are no loud words in this. 
When you have done that in such a way as to reduceabsenteeism by, say, 3 per cent—let alone 30—we shall say:you have done a fine job. 
 Our present Programme says: “...the participation of the trade unions in economic management and their activity in drawing the broad masses into this work.... 
” It does not contain a single promise or a single loud word; nor does it say anything about your doing the electing. 
 It does not resort to demagogy, but says that there is an ignorant, backward mass, that there are trade unions, which are so strong that they are leadingthe whole of the peasantry, and which themselves follow thelead of the Party, with a twenty-year schooling in the fight against tsarism. 
 No country has gone through what Russia has, and that is the secret of our strength. 
 Why is this regarded as a miracle? Because in a peasant country, only the trade unions can provide the economic bonds to unite mil-lions of scattered farms, if this mass of six million has faith in its Party, and continues to follow it as it had hitherto. 
 That is the secret of our strength, and the way it works is a political question. 
 How can a minority govern a huge peasant country, and why are we so composed? After ourthree years’ experience, there is no external or internal force that can break us. 
 Provided we do not make any extra-stupid mistakes leading to splits, we shall retain our posi-tions; otherwise everything will go to the dogs. 
 That iswhy, when Comrade Shlyapnikov says in his platform: “The All-Russia Congress of Producers shall elect a body to administer the whole national economy,” I say: read the whole of Paragraph 5 of our Programme, which I have read out to you, and you will see that thereis no attempt at intimidation either on Lenin’s or anyoneelse’s part. 
 Shlyapnikov concluded his speech by saying: “We must eliminate bureaucratic methods in government and the national economy. 
” I say this is demagogy. 
 We have had thisquestion of bureaucratic practices on the agenda since lastJuly. 
 After the Ninth Congress of the R. 
C. 
P. 
 last July,Preobrazhensky also asked: Are we not suffering frombureaucratic excesses? Watch out! In August, the Central Committee endorsed Zinoviev’s letter: Combat the evils of bureaucracy. 
 The Party Conference met in September,and endorsed it. 
 So, after all, it was not Lenin who inventedsome new path, as Trotsky says, but the Party which said:“Watch out: there’s a new malaise. 
” Preobrazhensky raisedthis question in July; we had Zinoviev’s letter in August; there was the Party Conference in September and we had a long report on bureaucratic practices at the Congress of Soviets in December. 
 The malaise is there. 
 In our 1919 Programme we wrote that bureaucratic practices existed. 
 Whoever comes out and demands a stop to bureaucraticpractices is a demagogue. 
 When you are called upon to“put a stop to bureaucratic practices”, it is demagogy. 
 Itis nonsense. 
 We shall be fighting the evils of bureaucracyfor many years to come, and whoever thinks otherwise is playing demagogue and cheating, because overcoming the evils of bureaucracy requires hundreds of measures, whole-sale literacy, culture and participation in the activity ofthe Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection. 
 23 Shlyapnikov has been People’s Commissar for Labour and People’s Commissarfor Trade and Industry. 
 Has he put a stop to bureaucratic practices? Kiselyov has been on the Central Board of the Textile Industry. 
 Has he put a stop to the evils of bureaucracy? Let me say this once again: We shall have grown up when all our congresses resolve themselves into sections andmarshal the facts about coalescence among the millers and the Donbas miners. 
 But writing a string of useless platforms shows up our poor economic leadership. 
 I repeat that noth-ing can break us, neither external nor internal forces, ifwe do not lead things up to a split. 
 I say that Tsektran ismore than a bludgeon, but exaggerating this has led up to asplit. 
 Anyone can be guilty of an excess of bureaucratic practices, and the Central Committee is aware of it, and is responsible for it. 
 In this respect, Comrade Trotsky’s mis-take lies in that he drew up his theses in the wrong spirit. 
They are all couched in terms of a shake-up, and they haveall led to a split in the union. 
 It is not a matter of givingTrotsky bad marks—we are not schoolchildren and have no use for marks—but we must say that his theses are wrong in content and must therefore be rejected.

—are waxing hot. 
 The first factionalpronouncement, namely, the one made by Comrade Trotskyon behalf of “a number of responsible workers” in his “plat-form pamphlet” ( The Role and Tasks of the Trade Unions , with a preface dated December 25, 1920), was followed by a sharp pronouncement (the reader will see from what followsthat it was deservedly sharp) by the Petrograd organisationof the R. 
C. 
P. 
 (“Appeal to the Party”, published in Petro-gradskaya Pravda 25 on January 6, 1921, and in the Party’s Central Organ, the Moscow Pravda , on January 13, 1921). 
 The Moscow Committee then came out againstthe Petrograd organisation (in the same issue of Pravda ). 
 Then appeared a verbatim report, published by the bureauof the R. 
C. 
P. 
 group of the All-Russia Central Council ofTrade Unions, of the discussion that took place on Decem-ber 30, 1920, at a very large and important Party meeting, namely, that of the R. 
C. 
P. 
 group at the Eighth Congressof Soviets. 
 It is entitled The Role of the Trade Unions in Production (with a preface dated January 6, 1921). 
 This, of course, is by no means all of the discussion material. 
 Partymeetings to discuss these issues are being held almost every-where. 
 On December 30, 1920, I spoke at a meeting in conditions in which, as I put it then, I “departed from therules of procedure ”, i. 
e. 
, in conditions in which I could not take part in the discussion or hear the preceding and subsequent speakers. 
 I shall now try to make amends and express myself in a more “orderly” fashion. 
 THE DANGER OF FACTIONAL PRONOUNCEMENTS TO THE PARTY Is Comrade Trotsky’s pamphlet The Role and Tasks of the Trade Unions a factional pronouncement? Irrespective of its content, is there any danger to the Party in a pro-nouncement of this kind? Attempts to hush up this questionare a particularly favourite exercise with the members ofthe Moscow Committee (with the exception of ComradeTrotsky, of course), who see the factionalism of the Petro-grad comrades, and with Comrade Bukharin, who, however, felt obliged, on December 30, 1920, to make the following statement on behalf of the “buffer group”: “...when a train seems to be heading for a crash, a buffer is not a bad thing at all” (report of the December 30, 1920 discussion, p. 
 45). 
 So there is some danger of a crash. 
 Can we conceive of intelligent members of the Party being indifferent to the question of how, where and when this danger arose? Trotsky’s pamphlet opens with the statement that “it is the fruit of collective work”, that “a number of respon-sible workers, particularly trade unionists (members of thePresidium of the All-Russia Central Council of Trade Unions, the Central Committee of the Metalworkers’ Union, Tsektran and others)” took part in compiling it, and thatit is a “platform pamphlet”. 
 At the end of thesis 4 we readthat “the forthcoming Party Congress will have to choose [Trotsky’s italics] between the two trends within the tradeunion movement”. 
 If this is not the formation of a faction by a member of the Central Committee, if this does not mean “headingfor a crash”, then let Comrade Bukharin, or anyone of hisfellow-thinkers, explain to the Party any other possiblemeaning of the words “factionalism “, and the Party“seems to be heading for a crash”. 
 Who can be more purblind than men wishing to play the “buffer” and closing their eyes to such a “danger of a crash”? Just imagine: after the Central Committee had spent two plenary meetings (November 9 and December 7) in an unprecedentedly long, detailed and heated discussion of Comrade Trotsky’s original draft theses and of the entire trade union policy that he advocates for the Party, onemember of the Central Committee, one out of nineteen , forms a group outside the Central Committee and presentsits “collective work” as a “platform”, inviting the PartyCongress “to choose between two trends”! This, incidentally, quite apart from the fact that Comrade Trotsky’s announce-ment of two and only two trends on December 25, 1920,despite Bukharin’s coming out as a “buffer” on November 9,is a glaring exposure of the Bukharin group’s true role asabettors of the worst and most harmful sort of factionalism. 
But I ask any Party member: Don’t you find this attack and insistence upon “choosing” between two trends in the trade union movement rather sudden? What is there for us to dobut stare in astonishment at the fact that after three yearsof the proletarian dictatorship even one Party member canbe found to “attack” the two trends issue in this way ? Nor is that all. 
 Look at the factional attacks in which this pamphlet abounds. 
 In the very first thesis we find a threatening “gesture” at “certain workers in the trade unionmovement ” who are thrown “back to trade-unionism, pure and simple, which the Party repudiated in principle longago” (evidently the Party is represented by only one memberof the Central Committee’s nineteen). 
 Thesis 8 grandilo-quently condemns “the craft conservatism prevalent among the top trade union functionaries” (note the truly bureau-cratic concentration of attention on the “top”!). 
 Thesis 11opens with the astonishingly tactful, conclusive andbusiness-like (what is the most polite word for it?) “hint” thatthe “majority of the trade unionists ... give only formal, that is, verbal , recognition” to the resolutions of the Party’s Ninth Congress. 
 We find that we have some very authoritative judges before us who say the majority (!) of the trade unionists give only verbal recognition to the Party’s decisions. 
 Thesis 12 reads: “...many trade unionists take an ever more aggressive and uncompromising stand against the prospect of ‘coalescence’.... 
 Among them we find Comrades Tomsky and Lozovsky. 
 “What is more, many trade unionists, balking at the new tasks, and methods, tend to cultivate in their midst a spirit of corporativeexclusiveness and hostility for the new men who are being drawninto the given branch of the economy, thereby actually fostering the survivals of craft-unionism among the organised workers. 
” Let the reader go over these arguments carefully and ponder them. 
 They simply abound in “gems”. 
 Firstly, thepronouncement must be assessed from the standpoint of factionalism! Imagine what Trotsky would have said, and how he would have said it, if Tomsky had published a plat-form accusing Trotsky and “many” military workers ofcultivating the spirit of bureaucracy, fostering the sur-vivals of savagery, etc. 
 What is the “role” of Bukharin,Preobrazhensky, Serebryakov and the others who fail to see—positively fail to note, utterly fail to note—the aggres-siveness and factionalism of all this, and refuse to see how much more factional it is than the pronouncement of thePetrograd comrades? Secondly, take a closer look at the approach to the subject: many trade unionists “tend to cultivate in their midst a spirit”.... 
 This is an out-and-out bureaucratic approach. 
 The whole point, you see, is not the level ofdevelopment and living conditions of the masses in theirmillions, but the “spirit” which Tomsky and Lozovskytend to cultivate “in their midst”. 
 Thirdly, Comrade Trotsky has unwittingly revealed the essence of the whole controversy which he and the Bukharin and Co. 
 “buffer” have been evading and camouflaging withsuch care. 
 What is the point at issue? Is it the fact that many trade unionists are balking at the new tasks and methods and tendto cultivate in their midst a spirit of hostility for the new officials? Or is it that the masses of organised workers are legitimately protesting and inevitably showing readiness tothrow out the new officials who refuse to rectify the uselessand harmful excesses of bureaucracy? Is it that someone has refused to understand the “new tasks and methods”? Or is it that someone is making a clumsy attempt to cover up his defence of certain useless and harmful excesses of bureaucracy with a lot of talk about new tasks and methods? It is this essence of the dispute that the reader should bear in mind. 
 FORMAL DEMOCRACY AND THE REVOLUTIONARY INTEREST “Workers’ democracy is free from fetishes”, Comrade Trotsky writes in his theses, which are the “fruit of collec-tive work”. 
 “Its sole consideration is the revolutionaryinterest” (thesis 23). 
 Comrade Trotsky’s theses have landed him in a mess. 
 That part of them which is correct is not new and, what ismore, turns against him. 
 That which is new is all wrong. 
 I have written out Comrade Trotsky’s correct proposi-tions. 
 They turn against him not only on the point in thesis23 (Glavpolitput) but on the others as well. 
 Under the rules of formal democracy, Trotsky had a right to come out with a factional platform even against thewhole of the Central Committee. 
 That is indisputable. 
 What is also indisputable is that the Central Committee had endorsed this formal right by its decision on freedomof discussion adopted on December 24, 1920. 
 Bukharin, thebuffer, recognises this formal right for Trotsky, but notfor the Petrograd organisation, probably because onDecember 30, 1920, he talked himself into “the sacred slogan of workers’ democracy” (verbatim report, p. 
 45).... 
 Well, and what about the revolutionary interest?Will any serious-minded person who is not blinded by the factional egotism of Tsektran” or of the “buffer” faction,will anyone in his right mind say that such a pronouncement on the trade union issue by such a prominent leader as Trotsky does promote the revolutionary interest ? Can it be denied that, even if Trotsky’s “new tasks and methods” were as sound as they are in fact unsound (ofwhich later), his very approach would be damaging tohimself, the Party, the trade union movement, the trainingof millions of trade union members and the Republic? It looks as if the kind Bukharin and his group call them-selves a “buffer” because they have firmly decided not to think about the obligations this title imposes upon them. 
 THE POLITICAL DANGER OF SPLITS IN THE TRADE UNION MOVEMENT Everyone knows that big disagreements sometimes grow out of minute differences, which may at first appear to bealtogether insignificant. 
 A slight cut or scratch, of the kindeveryone has had scores of in the course of his life, may becomevery dangerous and even fatal if it festers and if blood poisoning sets in. 
 This may happen in any kind of conflict, even a purely personal one. 
 This also happens in politics. 
 Any difference, even an insignificant one, may become politically dangerous if it has a chance to grow into a split,and I mean the kind of split that will shake and destroythe whole political edifice, or lead, to use ComradeBukharin’s simile, to a crash. 
 Clearly, in a country under the dictatorship of the pro-letariat, a split in the ranks of the proletariat, or betweenthe proletarian party and the mass of the proletariat, isnot just dangerous; it is extremely dangerous, especiallywhen the proletariat constitutes a small minority of thepopulation. 
 And splits in the trade union movement (which, as I tried hard to emphasise in my speech on December 30, 1920, is a movement of the almost completely organisedproletariat) mean precisely splits in the mass of theproletariat. 
 That is why, when the whole thing started at the Fifth All-Russia Conference of Trade Unions on November 2-6, 1920 (and that is exactly where it did start), and when right after the Conference—no, I am mistaken, during that Con-ference—Comrade Tomsky appeared before the PoliticalBureau in high dudgeon and, fully supported by ComradeRudzutak, the most even-tempered of men, began to relatethat at the Conference Comrade Trotsky had talked about “shaking up” the trade unions and that he, Tomsky, had opposed this—when that happened, I decided there andthen that policy (i. 
e. 
, the Party’s trade union policy) layat the root of the controversy, and that Comrade Trotsky,with his “shake-up” policy against Comrade Tomsky, wasentirely in the wrong. 
 For, even if the “shake-up ” policy were partly justified by the “new tasks and methods” (Trots-ky’s thesis 12), it cannot be tolerated at the present time,and in the present situation, because it threatens a split. 
 It now seems to Comrade Trotsky that it is “an utter travesty” to ascribe the “shake-up-from-above” policy to him (L. 
 Trotsky, “A Reply to the Petrograd Comrades”, Pravda No. 
 9, January 15, 1921). 
 But “shake-up” is a real“catchword”, not only in the sense that after being utteredby Comrade Trotsky at the Fifth All-Russia Conference ofTrade Unions it has, you might say, “caught on” throughoutthe Party and the trade unions. 
 Unfortunately, it remains true even today in the much more profound sense that it alone epitomises the whole spirit , the whole trend of the platform pamphlet entitled The Role and Tactics of the Trade Unions . 
 Comrade Trotsky’s platform pamphlet is shot through with the spirit of the “shake-up-from-above” policy. 
Just recall the accusation made against Comrade Tomsky, or “many trade unionists”, that they “tend to cultivate in their midst a spirit of hostility for the new men”! But whereas the Fifth All-Russia Conference of Trade Unions (November 2-6, 1920) only saw the makings of theatmosphere fraught with splits, the split within Tsektranbecame a fact in early December 1920. 
 This event is basic and essential to an understanding of the political essence of our controversies; and ComradesTrotsky and Bukharin are mistaken if they think hushingit up will help matters. 
 A hush-up in this case does notproduce a “buffer” effect but rouses passions; for the questionhas not only been placed on the agenda by developments, but has been emphasised by Comrade Trotsky in his platform pamphlet. 
 It is this pamphlet that repeatedly,in the passages I have quoted, particularly in thesis 12,raises the question of whether the essence of the matter isthat “many trade unionists tend to cultivate in their midsta spirit of hostility for the new men”, or that the “hostility” of the masses is legitimate in view of certain useless and harmful excesses of bureaucracy, for example, in Tsektran. 
 The issue was bluntly and properly stated by Comrade Zinoviev in his very first speech on December 30, 1920,when he said that it was “Comrade Trotsky’s immoderateadherents” who had brought about a split. 
 Perhaps that is why Comrade Bukharin abusively described Comrade Zinoviev’s speech as “a lot of hot air”? But every Party mem-ber who reads the verbatim report of the December 30, 1920 discussion will see that that is not true. 
 He will find that it is Comrade Zinoviev who quotes and operates with the facts, and that it is Trotsky and Bukharin who indulge most in intellectualist verbosity minus the facts. 
 When Comrade Zinoviev said, “Tsektran stands on feet of clay and has already split into three parts”, ComradeSosnovsky interrupted and said: “That is something you have encouraged” (verbatim report, p. 
 15). 
 Now this is a serious charge. 
 If it were proved, there would, of course, be no place on the Central Committee,in the R. 
C. 
P. 
, or in the trade unions of our Republic forthose who were guilty of encouraging a split even in one of the trade unions. 
 Happily, this serious charge was advanced in a thoughtless manner by a comrade who, I regret to say, has now and again been “carried away” by thought-less polemics before this. 
 Comrade Sosnovsky has evenmanaged to insert “a fly in the ointment” of his otherwiseexcellent articles, say, on production propaganda, and thishas tended to negate all its pluses. 
 Some people (like Com-rade Bukharin) are so happily constituted that they are incapable of injecting venom into their attacks even whenthe fight is bitterest; others, less happily constituted, areliable to do so, and do this all too often. 
 Comrade Sosnov-sky would do well to watch his step in this respect, andperhaps even ask his friends to help out. 
 But, some will say, the charge is there, even if it has been made in a thoughtless, unfortunate and patently“factional” form. 
 In a serious matter, the badly wordedtruth is preferable to the hush-up. 
 That the matter is serious is beyond doubt, for, let me say this again, the crux of the issue lies in this area to a greater extent than is generally suspected. 
 Fortunately, we are in possession of sufficiently objective and conclusivefacts to provide an answer in substance to Comrade Sosnov-sky’s point. 
 First of all, there is on the same page of the verbatim report Comrade Zinoviev’s statement denying Comrade Sosnovsky’s allegation and making precise references to conclusive facts. 
 Comrade Zinoviev showed that ComradeTrotsky’s accusation (made obviously, let me add, in an outburst of factional zeal) was quite a different one from Comrade Sosnovsky’s; Comrade Trotsky’s accusation was that Comrade Zinoviev’s speech at the September All-Russia Conference of the R. 
C. 
P. 
 had helped to bring about or had brought about the split. 
 (This charge, let me say in paren-thesis, is quite untenable, if only because Zinoviev’s Septem-ber speech was approved in substance by the CentralCommittee and the Party, and there has been no formal protest against it since. 
) Comrade Zinoviev replied that at the Central Committee meeting Comrade Rudzutak had used the minutes to provethat “ long before any of my [Zinoviev’s] speeches and the All-Russia Conference the question [concerning certainunwarranted and harmful excesses of bureaucracy in Tsek-tran] had been examined in Siberia, on the Volga, in the North and in the South”. 
 That is an absolutely precise and clear-cut statement of fact. 
 It was made by Comrade Zinoviev in his first speechbefore thousands of the most responsible Party members,and his facts were not refuted either by Comrade Trotsky, who spoke twice later , or by Comrade Bukharin, who also spoke later . 
 Secondly, the December 7, 1920 resolution of the Central Committee ’s Plenary Meeting concerning the dispute between the Communists working in water transport and the Com-munist group at the Tsektran Conference , given in the same verbatim report, was an even more definite and official refutation of Comrade Sosnovsky’s charges. 
 The part ofthe resolution dealing with Tsektran says: “In connection with the dispute between Tsektran and the water transport workers, the Central Committee resolves: 1) To set up aWater Transport Section within the amalgamated Tsektran; 2) Toconvene a congress of railwaymen and water transport workers inFebruary to hold normal elections to a new Tsektran; 3) To authorise the old Tsektran to function until then; 4) To abolish Glavpolitvod and Glavpolitput immediately and to transfer all their funds andresources to the trade union on normal democratic lines. 
” This shows that the water transport workers, far from being censured, are deemed to be right in every essential. 
 Yet none of the C. 
C. 
 members who had signed the common platform of January 14, 1921 (except Kamenev) voted for the resolution. 
 (The platform referred to is the Role and Tasks of the Trade Unions. 
 Draft Decision of the Tenth Congress of the R. 
C. 
P. 
 , submitted to the Central Committee by a group of members of the Central Committee and thetrade union commission. 
 Among those who signed it wasLozovsky, a member of the trade union commission butnot of the Central Committee. 
 The others were Tomsky,Kalinin, Rudzutak, Zinoviev, Stalin, Lenin, Kamenev, Petrovsky and Artyom Sergeyev. 
) This resolution was carried against the C. 
C. 
 members listed above, that is, against our group, for we would havevoted against allowing the old Tsektran to continue tem-porarily. 
 Because we were sure to win, Trotsky was forcedto vote for Bukharin’s resolution, as otherwise our resolu-tion would have been carried. 
 Comrade Rykov, who had been for Trotsky in November, took part in the trade unioncommission’s examination of the dispute between Tsektranand the water transport workers in December, and saw thatthe latter were right. 
 To sum up: the December 7 majority in the Central Committee consisted of Comrades Trotsky, Bukharin, Pre-obrazhensky, Serebryakov and other C. 
C. 
 members who areabove suspicion of being biased against Tsektran. 
 Yet the substance of their resolution did not censure the watertransport workers but Tsektran, which they just stoppedshort of dissolving there and then. 
 This proves Sosnovsky’s charge to be quite groundless. 
 There is one other point to be dealt with, if we are to leave no room for ambiguity. 
 What were these “certainunwarranted and harmful excesses of bureaucracy” to whichI have repeatedly referred? Isn’t this last charge unsup-ported or exaggerated? Once again it was Comrade Zinoviev who, in his very first speech on December 30, 1920, provided the answerwhich was as precise as one could wish. 
 He quoted fromComrade Zoff’s water transport circular of May 3, 1920:“Committee treadmill abolished. 
” 26 Comrade Zinoviev was quite right in saying this was a fundamental error. 
 It exem-plified the unwarranted and harmful excesses of bureauc-racy and the “appointments system”. 
 But he said thereand then that some appointees were “not half as experienced or as tried” as Comrade Zoff. 
 I have heard Comrade Zoff referred to in the Central Committee as a most valuable worker, and this is fully borne out by my own observations in the Council of Defence. 
 It has not entered anyone’s mindeither to make scapegoats of such comrades or to underminetheir authority (as Comrade Trotsky suggests, without theleast justification, on page 25 of his report). 
 Their authorityis not being undermined by those who try to correct the “appointees’” mistakes, but by those who would defend them even when they are wrong. 
 We see, therefore, that the danger of splits within the trade union movement was not imaginary but real. 
 Andwe find that the actual disagreements really boiled downto a demand that certain unwarranted and harmful excesses of bureaucracy, and the appointments system should not be justified or defended, but corrected. 
 That is all there isto it. 
 DISAGREEMENTS ON PRINCIPLE There being deep and basic disagreements on principle— we may well be asked—do they not serve as vindication forthe sharpest and most factional pronouncements? Is it pos-sible to vindicate such a thing as a split, provided thereis need to drive home some entirely new idea? I believe it is, provided of course the disagreements are truly very deep and there is no other way to rectify a wrong trend in the policy of the Party or of the working class. 
 But the whole point is that there are no such disagree-ments. 
 Comrade Trotsky has tried to point them out, andfailed. 
 A tentative or conciliatory approach had beenpossible—and necessary— before the publication of his pamphlet (December 25) (“such an approach is ruled out even in the case of disagreements and vague new tasks”);but after its publication we had to say: Comrade Trotsky is essentially wrong on all his new points. 
 This is most evident from a comparison of his theses with Rudzutak’s which were adopted by the Fifth All-Russia Conference of Trade Unions (November 2-6). 
 I quoted the latter in my December 30 speech and in the January 21issue of Pravda . 
 They are fuller and more correct than Trotsky’s, and wherever the latter differs from Rudzutak, he is wrong. 
 Take this famous “industrial democracy”, which Comrade Bukharin hastened to insert in the Central Committee’sresolution of December 7. 
 It would, of course, be ridiculousto quibble about this ill-conceived brainchild (“trickyflourishes”), if it merely occurred in an article or speech. 
But, after all, it was Trotsky and Bukharin who put them-selves into the ridiculous position by insisting in their theses on this very term, which is the one feature that distinguishes their “platforms” from Rudzutak’s thesesadopted by the trade unions. 
 The term is theoretically wrong. 
 In the final analysis, every kind of democracy, as political superstructure in general (which must exist until classes have been abolished and a classless society established), serves production andis ultimately determined by the relations of production ina given society. 
 It is, therefore, meaningless to single out“industrial democracy”, for this leads to confusion, andthe result is a dummy. 
 That is the first point. 
 The second is that if you look at Bukharin’s own expla-nation given in the resolution of the C. 
C. 
 Plenary Meetingon December 7, which he drafted, you will find that he says:“Accordingly, the methods of workers’ democracy mustbe those of industrial democracy, which means.... 
 ” Note the “which means”! The fact is that Bukharin opens his appeal to the masses with such an outlandish term that he must give a gloss on it. 
 This, I think, is undemocratic from the democratic standpoint. 
 You must write for the masseswithout using terms that require a glossary. 
 This is badfrom the “production” standpoint because time is wastedin explaining unnecessary terms. 
 “Which means,” he says, “that nomination and seconding of candidates, elections, etc. 
, must proceed with an eye not only to their politicalstaunchness, but also business efficiency, administrativeexperience, leadership, and proved concern for the workingpeople’s material and spiritual interests. 
” The reasoning there is obviously artificial and incor-rect. 
 For one thing, democracy is more than “nomination and seconding of candidates, elections, etc. 
” Then, again,not all elections should be held with an eye to political staunchness and business efficiency. 
 Comrade Trotsky not-withstanding, an organisation of many millions must have a certain percentage of canvassers and bureaucrats (we shall not be able to make do without good bureaucrats for manyyears to come). 
 But we do not speak of “canvassing” or “bureaucratic” democracy. 
 The third point is that it is wrong to consider only the elected, the organisers, the administrators, etc. 
 After all, they constitute a minority of outstanding men. 
 It is the mass, the rank and file that we must consider. 
 Rudzutakhas it in simpler, more intelligible and theoretically morecorrect terms (thesis 6): “... it must be brought home to each participant in production that his production tasks are appropriate and important; that eachmust not only take a hand in fulfilling his assignments, but also playan intelligent part in correcting any technical and organisationaldefects in the sphere of production. 
” The fourth point is that “industrial democracy” is a term that lends itself to misinterpretation. 
 It may be readas a repudiation of dictatorship and individual authority. 
 It may be read as a suspension of ordinary democracy or a pretext for evading it. 
 Both readings are harmful, andcannot be avoided without long special commentaries. 
 Rudzutak’s plain statement of the same ideas is more correct and more handy. 
 This is indirectly confirmed byTrotsky’s parallel of “war democracy” which he draws with his own term in an article, “Industrial Democracy”, in Pravda of January 11, and which fails to refute that his term is inaccurate and inconvenient (for he side-steps thewhole issue and fails to compare his theses with Rudzu-tak’s). 
 Happily, as far as I can recall, we have never hadany factional controversy over that kind of term. 
 Trotsky’s “production atmosphere” is even wider of the mark, and Zinoviev had good reason to laugh at it. 
 Thismade Trotsky very angry, and he came out with thisargument: “We once had a war atmosphere.... 
 We must nowhave a production atmosphere and not only on the surfacebut deep down in the workers’ mass. 
 This must be as intense and practical an interest in production as was earlier displayed in the fronts.... 
” Well, there you are: the mes-sage must be carried “deep down into the workers’ mass” in the language of Rudzutak’s theses, because “production atmosphere” will only earn you a smile or a shrug. 
 Comrade Trotsky’s “production atmosphere” has essentially the same meaning as production propaganda, but such expressionsmust be avoided when production propaganda is addressedto the workers at large. 
 The term is an example of hownot to carry it on among the masses. 
 POLITICS AND ECONOMICS. 
 DIALECTICS AND ECLECTICISM It is strange that we should have to return to such elementary questions, but we are unfortunately forced to doso by Trotsky and Bukharin. 
 They have both reproached me for “switching” the issue, or for taking a “political” approach, while theirs is an “economic” one. 
 Bukharin evenput that in his theses and tried to “rise above” either side,as if to say that he was combining the two. 
 This is a glaring theoretical error. 
 I said again in my speech that politics is a concentrated expression of econom-ics, because I had earlier heard my “political” approach rebuked in a manner which is inconsistent and inadmis-sible for a Marxist. 
 Politics must take precedence overeconomics. 
 To argue otherwise is to forget the ABC ofMarxism. 
 Am I wrong in my political appraisal? If you think so, say it and prove it. 
 But you forget the ABC of Marxism when you say (or imply) that the political approach isequivalent to the “economic”, and that you can take “theone and the other”. 
 What the political approach means, in other words, is that the wrong attitude to the trade unions will ruin the Soviet power and topple the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
 (In a peasant country like Russia, the Soviet power wouldsurely go down in the event of a split between the tradeunions and a Party in the wrong. 
) This proposition can(and must) be tested in substance, which means lookinginto the rights and wrongs of the approach and taking a decision. 
 To say: I “appreciate” your political, approach, “but” it is only a political one and we “ also need an economic one”, is tantamount to saying: I “appreciate” your point that in taking that particular step you are liable to break your neck, but you must also take into considera-tion that it is better to be clothed and well-fed than to go naked and hungry. 
 Bukharin’s insistence on combining the political and the economic approach has landed him in theoreticaleclecticism . 
 Trotsky and Bukharin make as though they are concerned for the growth of production whereas we have nothing but formal democracy in mind. 
 This picture is wrong, becausethe only formulation of the issue (which the Marxist stand-point allows ) is: without a correct political approach to the matter the given class will be unable to stay on top,and, consequently , will be incapable of solving its production problem either. 
 Let us take a concrete example. 
 Zinoviev says: “By car-rying things to a split within the trade unions, you aremaking a political mistake. 
 I spoke and wrote about thegrowth of production back in January 1920, citing the con-struction of the public baths as an example. 
” Trotsky replies: “What a thing to boast of: a pamphlet with the public baths as an example (p. 
 29), ‘and not a single word’ aboutthe tasks of the trade unions” (p. 
 22). 
 This is wrong. 
 The example of the public baths is worth, you will pardon the pun, a dozen “production atmospheres”,with a handful of “industrial democracies” thrown in. 
 It tells the masses, the whole bulk of them, what the trade unions are to do, and does this in plain and intelligibleterms, whereas all these “production atmospheres” and“democracies” are so much murk blurring the vision ofthe workers’ masses, and dimming their understanding. 
 Comrade Trotsky also rebuked me for not “saying a word” (p. 
 66) about “the role that has to be played—and is being played—by the levers known as the trade union apparatus”. 
 I beg to differ, Comrade Trotsky. 
 By reading out Rudzu-tak’s theses in toto and endorsing them, I made a state-ment on the question that was fuller , plainer , clearer and more correct than all your theses, your report or co-report, and speech in reply to the debate. 
 I insist that bonuses in kind and disciplinary comrades’ courts mean a greatdeal more to economic development, industrial manage-ment, and wider trade union participation in production than the absolutely abstract (and therefore empty) talk about “industrial democracy”, “coalescence”, etc. 
 Behind the effort to present the “production” standpoint (Trotsky) or to overcome a one-sided political approach andcombine it with an economic approach (Bukharin) we find: 1) Neglect of Marxism, as expressed in the theoretically incorrect, eclectic definition of the relation between politics and economics; 2 ) Defence or camouflage of the political mistake expressed in the shake-up policy, which runs through thewhole of Trotsky’s platform pamphlet, and which, unless it is admitted and corrected, leads to the collapse of the dictatorship of the proletariat; 3) A step back in purely economic and production matters, and the question of how to increase production; itis, in fact, a step back from Rudzutak’s practical theses, with their concrete, vital and urgent tasks (develop pro-duction propaganda; learn proper distribution of bonusesin kind and correct use of coercion through disciplinary comrades’ courts), to the highbrow, abstract, “empty” and theoretically incorrect general theses which ignore all that is most practical and business-like. 
 That is where Zinoviev and myself, on the one hand, and Trotsky and Bukharin, on the other, actually stand on thisquestion of politics and economics. 
 I could not help smiling, therefore, when I read Comrade Trotsky’s objection in his speech of December 30: “In hissumming-up at the Eighth Congress of Soviets of the debateon the situation, Comrade Lenin said we ought to have lesspolitics and more economics, but when he got to the tradeunion question he laid emphasis on the political aspect of the matter” (p. 
 65). 
 Comrade Trotsky thought these words were “very much to the point”. 
 Actually, however, theyreveal a terrible confusion of ideas, a truly hopeless “ideo-logical confusion”. 
 Of course, I have always said, and willcontinue to say, that we need more economics and lesspolitics, but if we are to have this we must clearly be rid of political dangers and political mistakes . 
 Comrade Trotsky’s political mistakes, aggravated by Comrade Bukharin,distract our Party’s attention from economic tasks and “production” work, and, unfortunately , make us waste time on correcting them and arguing it out with the syndicalist deviation (which leads to the collapse of the dictatorship of the proletariat), objecting to the incorrect approach tothe trade union movement (which leads to the collapse ofthe Soviet power), and debating general “theses”, insteadof having a practical and business-like “economic” discussionas to whether it was the Saratov millers, the Donbas miners, the Petrograd metalworkers or some other group that had the best results in coalescing, distributing bonuses in kind,and organising comrades’ courts, on the basis of Rudzu-tak’s theses, adopted by the Fifth All-Russia-Trade UnionConference on November 2-6. 
 Let us now consider what good there is in a “broad dis-cussion”. 
 Once again we find political mistakes distracting attention from economic tasks. 
 I was against this “broad”discussion, and I believed, and still do, that it was amistake—a political mistake—on Comrade Trotsky’s partto disrupt the work of the trade union commission, whichought to have held a business-like discussion. 
 I believe Bukharin’s buffer group made the political mistake of misunderstanding the tasks of the buffer (in which casethey had once again substituted eclecticism for dialectics),for from the “buffer” standpoint they should have vigorous-ly opposed any broad discussion and demanded that thematter should be taken up by the trade union commission. 
 Here is what came of this. 
 On December 30, Bukharin went so far as to say that “we have proclaimed the new and sacred slogan of workers’democracy, which means that questions are no longer to bediscussed in the board-room within the corporation or atsmall meetings but are to be placed before big meetings. 
 I insist that by taking the trade union issue before such a large meeting as this one we are not taking a step back-ward but forward” (p. 
 45). 
 And this man has accused Zino-viev of spouting “hot air” and overdoing the democracy!I say that he himself has given us a lot of hot air and has shown some unexampled bungling; he has completely failed to understand that formal democracy must be subordinateto the revolutionary interest. 
 Trotsky is in the same boat. 
 His charge is that “Lenin wants at all costs to disrupt or shelve the discussion of the matter in essence” (p. 
 65). 
 He declares: “My reasons for refusing to serve on the commission were clearly stated in the Central Committee: until such time as I am permitted,on a par with all other comrades, to air these questionsfully in the Party press, I do not expect any good to comeof any cloistered examination of these matters, and, con-sequently, of work on the commission” (p. 
 69). 
 What is the result? Less than a month has passed since Trotsky started his “broad discussion” on December 25, andyou will be hard put to find one responsible Party workerin a hundred who is not fed up with the discussion and hasnot realised its futility (to say no worse). 
 For Trotsky hasmade the Party waste time on a discussion of words and bad theses, and has ridiculed as “cloistered” the business-like economic discussion in the commission, which was to have studied and verified practical experience and projectedits lessons for progress in real “production” work, in place of the regress from vibrant activity to scholastic exercises in all sorts of “production atmospheres”. 
 Take this famous “coalescence”. 
 My advice on December 30 was that we should keep mum on this point, because wehad not studied our own practical experience, and without that any discussion was bound to degenerate into “hot air”and draw off the Party’s forces from economic work. 
 I said it was bureaucratic projecteering for Trotsky to propose in his theses that from one-third to one-half and from one-half to two-thirds of the economic councils should consist oftrade unionists. 
 For this I was upbraided by Bukharin who, I see from p. 
 49 of the report, made a point of proving to me at lengthand in great detail that “when people meet to discuss something, they should not act as deaf-mutes” ( sic). 
 Trotsky was also angry and exclaimed: “Will every one of you please make a note that on this particular date Comrade Lenin described this as a bureaucratic evil. 
 I take the liberty to predict that within a few months we shall have accepted for our guidance and consideration that the All-Russia Central Councilof Trade Unions and the Supreme Economic Council, the CentralCommittee of the Metalworkers’ Union and the Metals Department,etc. 
, are to have from one-third to one-half of their members incommon” (p. 
 68). 
 When I read that I asked Comrade Milyutin (Deputy Chairman of the Supreme Economic Council) to let me have the available printed reports on coalescence. 
 I said to my-self: why not make a small start on the study of our practical experience ; it’s so dull engaging in “general Party talk” (Bukharin’s expression, p. 
 47, which has every chance ofbecoming a catchword like “shake-up”) to no useful purpose,without the facts, and inventing disagreements, definitions and “industrial democracies”. 
 Comrade Milyutin sent me several books, including The Report of the Supreme Economic Council to the Eighth All-Russia Congress of Soviets (Moscow, 1920; preface dated December 19, 1920). 
 On its p. 
 14 is a table showing work-ers’ participation in administrative bodies.

6 per cent, that is, closer to two-thirds than to one-half, of the staff of administrative bodies now consists of workers. 
 And this already proves that what Trotsky wrote on this matter in his theses was an exercisein bureaucratic projecteering. 
 To talk, argue and write platforms about “one-third to one-half” and “one-half to two-thirds” is the most useless sort of “general Party talk”, which diverts time, attention and resources from production work. 
 It is empty politicking. 
 All this while, a great dealof good could have been done in the commission, wheremen of experience would have refused to write any theseswithout a study of the facts, say, by polling a dozen or so“common functionaries” (out of the thousand), by compar-ing their impressions and conclusions with objective statistical data, and by making an attempt to obtainpractical guidance for the future: that being our experience,do we go straight on, or do we make some change in ourcourse, methods and approach, and how; or do we call ahalt, for the good of the cause, and check things over and over again, make a few changes here and there, and so on and so forth. 
 Comrades, a real “executive” (let me also have a go at “production propaganda”) is well aware that even inthe most advanced countries, the capitalists and theirexecutives take years—sometimes ten and more—to study and test their own (and others’) practical experience, mak-ing innumerable starts and corrections to tailor a systemof management, select senior and junior executives, etc. 
,fit for their particular business. 
 That was the rule undercapitalism, which throughout the civilised world based itsbusiness practices on the experience and habits of centuries . 
 We who are breaking new ground must put in a long, persistent and patient effort to retrain men and changethe old habits which have come down to us from capitalism,but this can only be done little by little. 
 Trotsky’s approachis quite wrong. 
 In his December 30 speech he exclaimed:“Do or do not our workers, Party and trade union functionaries have any production training? Yes or no? I say: No” (p. 
 29). 
 This is a ridiculous approach. 
 It islike asking whether a division has enough felt boots: Yesor no? It is safe to say that even ten years from now we shall have to admit that all our Party and trade union functionaries do not have enough production training, in much the same way as the workers of the Military Depart-ment, the trade unions and the Party will not have had enough military experience. 
 But we have made a start on production training by having about a thousand workers, and trade union members and delegates take part in management and run factories, head offices and otherbodies higher up the scale. 
 The basic principle underlying“production training”—which is the training of our own selves , of the old underground workers and professional journalists—is that we should start a painstaking and detailed study of our own practical experience, and teach others to do so, according to the rule: Look before youleap. 
 The fundamental and absolute rule behind “productiontraining” is systematic, circumspect, practical and business-like verification of what this one thousand have done, andeven more efficient and careful correction of their work, taking a step forward only when there is ample proof of the usefulness of a given method, system of management,proportion, selection of men, etc. 
 And it is this rule thatComrade Trotsky has broken by his theses and approach. 
All his theses, his entire platform pamphlet, are so wrongthat they have diverted the Party’s attention and resources from practical “production” work to a lot of empty talk. 
 DIALECTICS AND ECLECTICISM. 
 “SCHOOL” AND “APPARATUS” Among Comrade Bukharin’s many excellent traits are his theoretical ability and keen interest in getting at thetheoretical roots of every question. 
 That is a very valuabletrait because you cannot have a proper understanding ofany mistake, let alone a political one, unless you dig downto its theoretical roots among the basic premises of the one who makes it. 
 Responding to this urge, Comrade Bukharin tended to shift the controversy into the theoretical sphere, beginningfrom December 30, if not earlier. 
 In his speech on that day he said: “That neither the political nor the economic factor can be ignored is, I believe, absolutely incontrovertible—and that is the theoretical essence of what is here known as the ‘buffer group’ or itsideology” (p. 
 47). 
 The gist of his theoretical mistake in this case is substitu-tion of eclecticism for the dialectical interplay of politics and economics (which we find in Marxism). 
 His theoretical attitude is: “on the one hand, and on the other”, “the oneand the other”. 
 That is eclecticism. 
 Dialectics requires anall-round consideration of relationships in their concretedevelopment but not a patchwork of bits and pieces. 
 Ihave shown this to be so on the example of politics and economics. 
 That of the “buffer” has gone to reinforce the point. 
 You need a buffer, and it is useful when the Party trainis heading for a crash. 
 No question about that at all. 
Bukharin has built up his “buffer” problem eclectically, bycollecting odd pieces from Zinoviev and Trotsky. 
 As a “buffer”, Bukharin should have decided for himself just where, when and how each individual or group had madetheir mistake, whether it was a theoretical mistake, one ofpolitical tact, factional pronouncement, or exaggeration,etc. 
 He should have done that and gone hammer and tongs at every such mistake. 
 But he has failed to understand his task of “buffer”, and here is good proof of it. 
 The Communist group of Tsektran’s Petrograd Bureau (the C. 
C. 
 of the Railwaymen’s and Water Transport Workers’Union), an organisation sympathising with Trotsky, hasstated its opinion that, “on the main issue of the tradeunions’ role in production, Comrades Trotsky and Bukharin hold views which are variations of one and the same standpoint”. 
 It has issued Comrade Bukharin’s report inPetrograd on January 3, 1921, in pamphlet form (N. 
 Bukha-rin, The Tasks of the Trade Unions , Petrograd, 1921). 
 It says: “Comrade Trotsky’s original formulation was that the trade union leadership should be removed and suitable comrades found to take their place, etc. 
 He had earlier advocated a ‘shake-up’, but he hasnow abandoned the idea, and it is therefore quite absurd to use itas an argument against him” (p. 
 5). 
 I will let pass the numerous factual inaccuracies in this statement. 
 (Trotsky used the term “shake-up” at the Fifth All-Russia Conference of Trade Unions, November 2-6. 
 He mentions “selection of leadership” in Paragraph 5 ofhis theses which he submitted to the Central Committee on November 8, and which, incidentally, some of his supporters have published as a leaflet. 
 The whole of Trotsky’s pamphlet, The Role and Tasks of the Trade Unions , Decem-ber 25, reveals the same kind of mentality, the same spirit asI have pointed out before. 
 When and how he “abandoned”this attitude remains a mystery. 
) I am now dealing witha different matter. 
 When the “buffer” is an eclectic, hepasses over some mistakes and brings up others; he says nothing of them in Moscow on December 30, 1920, when addressing thousands of R. 
C. 
P. 
 functionaries from all overRussia; but he brings them up in Petrograd on January 3,1921. 
 When the “buffer” is a dialectician, he directs thefull brunt of his attack at every mistake he sees on eitherside, or on all sides. 
 And that is something Bukharin does not do. 
 He does not even try to examine Trotsky’s pamphlet in the light of the “shake-up” policy. 
 He simply says nothing about it . 
 No wonder his buffer performance has made everyone laugh. 
 To proceed. 
 In that same Petrograd speech he says (p. 
 7): “Comrade Trotsky’s mistake is insufficient support for the school-of-communism idea. 
” During the December 30 discussion, Bukharin reasoned as follows: “Comrade Zinoviev has said that the trade unions are a school of communism, and Trotsky has said that they are a technical andadministrative apparatus for industrial management. 
 I see no logical grounds for proof that either proposition is wrong; both, and a combi-nation of both, are right” (p. 
 48). 
 Bukharin and his “group” or “faction” make the same point in their thesis 6: “On the one hand, they [the tradeunions] are a school of communism ... and on the other, they are—increasingly—a component part of the economic apparatus and of state administration in general” ( Pravda , January 16). 
 That is where we find Comrade Bukharin’s fundamental theoretical mistake, which is substitution of eclecticism(especially popular with the authors of diverse “fashionable” and reactionary philosophical systems) for Marxist dialectics. 
 When Comrade Bukharin speaks of “logical” grounds, his whole reasoning shows that he takes—unconsciously, perhaps—the standpoint of formal or scholastic logic, and not of dialectical or Marxist logic. 
 Let me explain this by taking the simple example which Comrade Bukharin himself gives. 
 In the December 30 discussion he said: “Comrades, many of you may find that the current controversy suggests something like this: two men come in and invite each otherto define the tumbler on the lectern. 
 One says: ‘It is a glass cylinder, and a curse on anyone who says different. 
’ The other one says: ‘A tumbler is a drinking vessel, and a curse on anyone who says different’”(p. 
 46). 
 The reader will see that Bukharin’s example was meant to give me a popular explanation of the harm of one-trackthinking. 
 I accept it with gratitude, and in the one-good-turn-deserves-another spirit offer a popular explanation of the difference between dialectics and eclecticism. 
 A tumbler is assuredly both a glass cylinder and a drink-ing vessel. 
 But there are more than these two properties,qualities or facets to it; there are an infinite number ofthem, an infinite number of “mediacies” and inter-relation-ships with the rest of the world. 
 A tumbler is a heavy object which can be used as a missile; it can serve as a paper-weight, a receptacle for a captive butterfly, or a valuableobject with an artistic engraving or design, and this hasnothing at all to do with whether or not it can be usedfor drinking, is made of glass, is cylindrical or not quite, and so on and so forth. 
 Moreover, if I needed a tumbler just now for drinking, it would not in the least matter how cylindrical it was,and whether it was actually made of glass; what wouldmatter though would be whether it had any holes in thebottom, or anything that would cut my lips when I drank, etc. 
 But if I did not need a tumbler for drinking but for a purpose that could be served by any glass cylinder, atumbler with a cracked bottom or without one at all woulddo just as well, etc. 
 Formal logic, which is as far as schools go (and should go, with suitable abridgements for the lower forms), deals with formal definitions, draws on what is most common, or glaring, and stops there. 
 When two or more differentdefinitions are taken and combined at random (a glass cylinder and a drinking vessel), the result is an eclectic definition which is indicative of different facets of the object, and nothing more. 
 Dialectical logic demands that we should go further. 
 Firstly, if we are to have a true knowledge of an objectwe must look at and examine all its facets, its connectionsand “mediacies”. 
 That is something we cannot ever hope toachieve completely, but the rule of comprehensiveness is a safeguard against mistakes and rigidity. 
 Secondly, dia-lectical logic requires that an object should be taken indevelopment, in change, in “self-movement” (as Hegelsometimes puts it). 
 This is not immediately obvious inrespect of such an object as a tumbler, but it, too, is in flux,and this holds especially true for its purpose, use and connection with the surrounding world. 
 Thirdly, a full “definition” of an object must include the whole of humanexperience, both as a criterion of truth and a practicalindicator of its connection with human wants. 
 Fourthly,dialectical logic holds that “truth is always concrete,never abstract”, as the late Plekhanov liked to say after Hegel. 
 (Let me add in parenthesis for the benefit of young Party members that you cannot hope to become a real , intelligent Communist without making a study—and Imean study —of all of Plekhanov’s philosophical writings, because nothing better has been written on Marxismanywhere in the world. 
 *) I have not, of course, run through the whole notion of dialectical logic, but what I have said will do for thepresent. 
 I think we can return from the tumbler to thetrade unions and Trotsky’s platform. 
 “A school, on the one hand, and an apparatus on the other”, says Bukharin, and writes as much in his theses. 
 Trotsky’s mistake is “insufficient support for the school-*By the way, it would be a good thing, first, if the current edition of Plekhanov’s works contained a special volume or volumesof all his philosophical articles, with detailed indexes, etc. 
, to beincluded in a series of standard textbooks on communism; secondly,I think the workers’ state must demand that professors of philosophyshould have a knowledge of Plekhanov’s exposition of Marxist philosophy and ability to impart it to their students. 
 But all that is a digression from “propaganda” to “administration”. 
 of-communism idea”; Zinoviev errs by being lukewarm on the apparatus “factor”. 
 Why is Bukharin’s reasoning no more than inert and empty eclecticism? It is because he does not even try tomake an independent analysis, from his own standpoint,either of the whole course of the current controversy (asMarxism, that is , dialectical logic, unconditionally demands) or of the whole approach to the question, the whole presen-tation—the whole trend of the presentation, if you will— of the question at the present time and in these concretecircumstances. 
 You do not see Bukharin doing that at all!His approach is one of pure abstraction: he makes no attemptat concrete study, and takes bits and pieces from Zinovievand Trotsky. 
 That is eclecticism. 
 Here is another example to clarify the picture. 
 I know next to nothing about the insurgents and revolutionariesof South China (apart from the two or three articles bySun Yat-sen, and a few books and newspaper articles Iread many years ago). 
 Since there are these uprisings, it isnot too far-fetched to assume a controversy going on between Chinese No. 
 1, who says that the insurrection is the product of a most acute nation-wide class struggle, and ChineseNo. 
 2, who says that insurrection is an art. 
 That is all Ineed to know in order to write theses à la Bukharin: “On the one hand, ... on the other hand”. 
 The one has failedto reckon with the art “factor”, and the other, with the “acuteness factor”, etc. 
 Because no concrete study is made of this particular controversy, question, approach, etc. 
, the result is a dead and empty eclecticism. 
 On the one hand, the trade unions are a school, and on the other, an apparatus; but they also happen to be anorganisation of working people, an almost exclusive organ-isation of industrial workers, an organisation by industry, etc. 
 * Bukharin does not make any analysis for himself, nor does he produce a shred of evidence to prove why it isthat we should consider the first two “facets” of the question *Incidentally, here again Trotsky makes a mistake. 
 He thinks that an industrial union is designed to control industry. 
 That iswrong. 
 When you say that a union is an industrial one you mean thatit admits to membership workers in one industry, which is inevitable at the present level of technology and culture (in Russia and else-where). 
 or object, instead of the third, the fourth, the fifth, etc. 
 That is why his group’s theses are an eclectic soap bubble. 
 His presentation of the “school-apparatus” relationship is fundamentally eclectic and wrong. 
 The only way to view this question in the right light is to descend from empty abstractions to the concrete, thatis, the present issue. 
 Whether you take it in the form itassumed at the Fifth All-Russia Conference of Trade Unions, or as it was presented and slanted by Trotsky himself in his platform pamphlet of December 25, you will find that hiswhole approach is quite wrong and that he has gone off at a tangent. 
 He has failed to understand that the trade unionscan and must be viewed as a school both when raising thequestion of “Soviet trade-unionism”, and when speaking of production propaganda in general, and even when con-sidering “coalescence” and trade union participation inindustrial management, as Trotsky does . 
 On this last point, as it is presented in Trotsky’s platform pamphlet, themistake lies in his failure to grasp that the trade unionsare a school of technical and administrative management of production . 
 In the context of the controversy, you can-not say: “a school, on the one hand, and something elseon the other”; given Trotsky’s approach, the trade unions,whichever way you look at them, are a school. 
 They are aschool of unity, solidarity, management and administration,where you learn how to protect your interests. 
 Instead of making an effort to comprehend and correct Comrade Trots-ky’s fundamental mistake, Comrade Bukharin has produceda funny little amendment: “On the one hand, and on theother. 
” Let us go deeper into the question. 
 Let us see what the present trade unions are, as an “apparatus” of industrial management. 
 We have seen from the incomplete returns that about 900 workers—trade union members and delegates—are engaged in industrial management. 
 If you multiplythis number by 10 or even by 100—if it helps to clarifyyour fundamental mistake let us assume this incrediblespeed of “advance” in the immediate future—you still have an insignificant proportion of those directly engaged in management , as compared with the mass of six million trade union members. 
 This makes it even clearer that it is quite wrong to look to the “leading stratum”, and talk about the trade unions’ role in production and industrial management, as Trotsky does, forgetting that 98. 
5 per cent (6 million minus 90,000 equals 5,910,000 or 98. 
5 per centof the total) are learning , and will have to continue to do so for a long time to come . 
 Don’t say school and management, say school of management . 
 In his December 30 argument against Zinoviev, whom he accused, quite groundlessly and incorrectly, of denying the “appointments system”, that is, the Central Committee’sright and duty to make appointments, Comrade Trotskyinadvertently drew the following telltale comparison: “Zinoviev tends to overdo the propaganda angle on every practical matter, forgetting that it is not only a source of material for agitation,but also a problem requiring an administrative solution” (p. 
 27). 
 Before I explain in detail the potential administrative approach to the issue, let me say that Comrade Trotsky’sfundamental mistake is that he treats (rather, maltreats)the questions he himself had brought up in his platform pamphlet as administrative ones, whereas they could be and ought to be viewed only from the propaganda angle . 
 In effect, what are Trotsky’s good points? One undoubtedly good and useful point is his production propaganda , but that is not in his theses, but in his speeches , specially when he forgets about his unfortunate polemics with the allegedly “conservative” wing of the trade-unionists. 
 He would undoubtedly have done (and I believe he willdo) a great deal of good in the trade union commission’spractical business, as speaker and writer, and as a memberof the All-Russia Production Propaganda Bureau. 
 Hisplatform theses were a mistake, for through them, like a scarlet thread, runs the administrative approach to the “crisis” and the “two trends” within the trade unions,the interpretation of the R. 
C. 
P. 
 Programme, “Soviet trade-unionism”, “production training” and “coalescence”. 
 I havelisted all the main points of Trotsky’s “platform” andthey all happen to be topics which, considering the material at Trotsky’s disposal, can be correctly approached at the present time only from the propaganda angle. 
 The state is a sphere of coercion. 
 It would be madness to renounce coercion, especially in the epoch of the dictator-ship of the proletariat, so that the administrative approach and “steerage” are indispensable. 
 The Party is the leader, the vanguard of the proletariat, which rules directly. 
It is not coercion but expulsion from the Party that isthe specific means of influence and the means of purgingand steeling the vanguard. 
 The trade unions are a reservoirof the state power, a school of communism and a school of management. 
 The specific and cardinal thing in this sphere is not administration but the “ ties” “between the central state administration” (and, of course, the localas well), “the national economy and the broad masses of the working people” (see Party Programme, economicsection, §5, dealing with the trade unions). 
 The whole of Trotsky’s platform pamphlet betrays an incorrect approach to the problem and a misunderstandingof this relationship. 
 Let us assume that Trotsky had taken a different approach to this famous question of “coalescence” in connectionwith the other topics of his platform, and that his pamphlet was entirely devoted to a detailed investigation of, say, 90 of the 900 cases of “coalescence” where trade unionofficials and members concurrently held elective tradeunion posts and Supreme Economic Council posts in indus-trial management. 
 Let us say these 90 cases had beenanalysed together with the returns of a selective statistical survey, the reports of inspectors and instructors of Rabkrin and the People’s Commissariats concerned: let us say theyhad been analysed in the light of the data supplied by theadministrative bodies, the results of the work, the headwayin production, etc. 
 That would have been a correct administra-tive approach, and would have fully indicated the “shake-up” line, which implies concentrating attention on removals, transfers, appointments and the immediate demands tobe made on the “leading stratum”. 
 When Bukharin saidin his January 3 speech, published by the Tsektran peoplein Petrograd, that Trotsky had at first wanted a “shake-up”but had now abandoned the idea, he made another one of his eclectical mistakes, which is ridiculous from the practical standpoint and theoretically inadmissible for a Marxist. 
He takes the question in the abstract, being unable (or unwilling) to get down to brass tacks. 
 So long as we, the Party’s Central Committee and the whole Party, continue to run things, that is, govern, we shall never—we cannot— dispense with the “shake-up”, that is, removals, transfers,appointments, dismissals, etc. 
 But Trotsky’s platformpamphlet deals with something else, and does not raise the“question of practical business” at all. 
 It is not this butthe “ trends within the trade union movement” (Trotsky’s thesis 4, end) that was being debated by Zinoviev and Trotsky, Bukharin and myself, and in fact the whole Party. 
 This is essentially a political question. 
 Because of the substance of the case—this concrete, particular “case “—it is impossible to correct Trotsky’s mistake by means ofeclectic little amendments and addenda, as Bukharin has been trying to do, being moved undoubtedly by the most humane sentiments and intensions. 
 There is only one answer. 
First, there must be a correct solution of the political question of the “trends within the trade union movement”,the relationship between classes, between politics and economics, the specific role of the state, the Party, the trade unions, as “school” and apparatus, etc. 
 Second, once the correct political decision has been adopted, a diversified nation-wide production propagandacampaign must be carried through, or, rather, systematicallycarried forward with persistence and patience over a long term, under the sponsorship and direction of a state agency. 
 It should be conducted in such a way as to cover the sameground over and over again. 
 Third, the “questions of practical business” must not be confused with trend issues which properly belong to thesphere of general Party talk” and broad discussions; they must be dealt with as practical matters in the working commissions, with a hearing of witnesses and a study ofmemoranda, reports and statistics. 
 And any necessary“shake-up” must be carried out only on that basis and inthose circumstances: only under a decision of the competentSoviet or Party organ, or of both. 
 Trotsky and Bukharin have produced a hodgepodge of political mistakes in approach, breaks in the middle ofthe transmission belts, and unwarranted and futile attacks on “administrative steerage”. 
 It is now clear where the “theoretical” source of the mistake lies, since Bukharin has taken up that aspect of it with his example of the tumbler. 
 His theoretical—in this case, gnosiological—mistake lies in his substitution of eclecticism for dialectics. 
His eclectic approach has confused him and has landed himin syndicalism. 
 Trotsky’s mistake is one-track thinking,compulsiveness, exaggeration and obstinacy. 
 His platform says that a tumbler is a drinking vessel, but this particular tumbler happens to have no bottom. 
 CONCLUSION It remains for me to go over a few more points which must be dealt with to prevent misunderstanding. 
 Thesis 6 of Trotsky’s platform quotes Paragraph 5 of the economic section of the R. 
C. 
P. 
 Programme, which dealswith the trade unions. 
 Two pages later, his thesis 8 says: “Having lost the old basis of their existence, the class economic struggle, the trade unions...” (that is wrong, and is a hasty exaggeration: the trade unions no longer have to face the class economic struggle but the non-class “economic struggle”, which means combating bureaucraticdistortions of the Soviet apparatus, safeguarding the work-ing people’s material and spiritual interests in ways andmeans inaccessible to this apparatus, etc. 
 This is a struggle they will unfortunately have to face for many more years to come). 
 “The trade unions,” says Trotsky, “have, forvarious reasons, not yet succeeded in mustering the neces-sary forces and working out the necessary methods enablingthem to solve the new task, that of organising production ” (Trotsky’s italics, p. 
 9, thesis 8), “set before them by the proletarian revolution and formulated in our Programme. 
” That is yet another hasty exaggeration which is pregnant with grave error. 
 The Programme does not contain anysuch formulation nor does it set the trade unions the taskof “organising production”. 
 Let us go over the propositionsin the Party’s Programme as they unfold in the text: (1) “The organisational apparatus” (but not the others) “of socialised industry should rely chiefly” (but not exclusively)“on the trade unions. 
” (2) “They must to an ever increasing degree divest themselves of the narrow craft-union spirit” (how? under the leadership of the Party and through the proletariat’s educational and other influence on the non-proletarian mass of working people) “and becomelarge industrial associations, embracing the majority, andeventually all of the workers in the given industry. 
” That is the first part of the section of the Party Pro-gramme dealing with the trade unions. 
 You will have noted that it starts by laying down very “ strict conditions” demanding a long sustained effort for what is to follow. 
And what follows is this: “The trade unions being, on the strength of the laws of the Soviet Republic and established practice, participants”(note the cautious statement: participants only) “in all the local and central organs of industrial management, should eventually arrive at a de facto concentration in their hands of the whole administration of the whole national economy,as a single economic entity” (note this: should arrive at ade facto concentration of management not of branches of industry and not of industry as a whole, but of the whole national economy, and moreover, as an economic entity. 
 In economic terms, this condition may be considered ful-filled only when the petty producers both in industry andagriculture account for less than one-half of the populationand the national economy). 
 “The trade unions ensuringin this way” (the way which helps to realise all the condi-tions listed earlier) “indissoluble ties between the central state administration, the national economy and the broadmasses of working people, should draw the latter” (that is,the masses, the majority of the population) “into directeconomic management on the widest possible scale. 
 At thesame time, the participation of the trade unions in economic management and their activity in drawing the broad masses into this work are the principal means of combating thebureaucratisation of the economic apparatus of the Sovietpower and making possible the establishment of trulypopular control over the results of production. 
” There again, in that last sentence, we find a very cautious phrase: “participation in economic management”; and another reference to the recruitment of the broad massesas the chief (but not the only) means of combating bureaucratic practices; finally, we find a highly cautious statement: “ making possible ” the establishment of “ popu-lar”—that is, workers’ and peasants’, and not just purely proletarian—“ control ”. 
 It is obviously wrong to boil this down to the Party Programme “formulating” the trade unions’ task as “organi-sation of production”. 
 And if you insist on this error,and write it into your platform theses, you will get nothing but an anti-communist, syndicalist deviation. 
 Incidentally, Comrade Trotsky says in his theses that “over the last period we have not made any headway towardsthe goal set forth in the Programme but have in factretreated from it” (p. 
 7, thesis 6). 
 That statement isunsupported, and, I think, wrong. 
 It is no proof to say, as Trotsky did in the discussions, that the trade unions “themselves” admit this. 
 That is not the last resort, asfar as the Party is concerned, and, generally speaking,the proof lies only in a serious and objective study of agreat number of facts. 
 Moreover, even if such proof wereforthcoming, there would remain this question: Why have we retreated? Is it because “many trade-unionists” are “balking at the new tasks and methods”, as Trotsky believes,or because “we have not yet succeeded in mustering thenecessary forces and working out the necessary methods”to cut short and correct certain unwarranted and harmfulexcesses of bureaucracy? Which brings me to Bukharin’s rebuke of December 30 (repeated by Trotsky yesterday, January 24, during ourdiscussion in the Communist group of the Second Miners’Congress) that we have “dropped the line laid down by theNinth Party Congress” (p. 
 46 of the report on the December30 discussion). 
 He alleged that at that Congress I had defended the militarisation of labour and had jeered at references to democracy, all of which I now “repudiate”. 
In his reply to the debate on December 30, Comrade Trotskyadded this barb: “Lenin takes account of the fact that ...there is a grouping of opposition-minded comrades withinthe trade unions” (p. 
 65); that I view it from the “diplomatic angle” (p. 
 69), and that there is “manoeuvring inside the Party groups” (p. 
 70), etc. 
 Putting such a complexion onthe case is, of course, highly flattering for Trotsky, and /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR worse than unflattering for me. 
 But let us look at the facts. 
 In that same discussion on December 30, Trotsky and Krestinsky established the fact that “as long ago as July(1920), Comrade Preobrazhensky had proposed to theCentral Committee that we should switch to a new track inrespect of the internal life of our workers’ organisations”(p. 
 25). 
 In August, Comrade Zinoviev drafted a letter, and the Central Committee approved a C. 
C. 
 letter on combating red-tape and extending democracy. 
 In September, thequestion was brought up at a Party conference whose deci-sions were endorsed by the Central Committee. 
 In December,the question of combating red-tape was laid before theEighth Congress of Soviets. 
 Consequently, the whole Central Committee, the whole Party and the whole workers’ and peasants’ Republic had recognised that the question ofthe bureaucracy and ways of combating its evils was highon the agenda. 
 Does any “repudiation” of the Ninth Congressof the R. 
C. 
P. 
 follow from all this? Of course, not. 
 Thedecisions on the militarisation of labour, etc. 
, are incon-testable, and there is no need for me at all to withdraw any of my jibes at the references to democracy by those whochallenged these decisions. 
 What does follow is that we shallbe extending democracy in the workers’ organisations,without turning it into a fetish; that we shall redoubleour attention to the struggle against bureaucratic practices; and that we shall take special care to rectify any unwarranted and harmful excesses of bureaucracy, no matter who pointsthem out. 
 One final remark on the minor question of priority and equalisation. 
 I said during the December 30 discussionthat Trotsky’s formulation of thesis 41 on this point was theoretically wrong, because it implied priority in produc-tion and equalisation in consumption. 
 I replied thatpriority implied preference and that that was nothingunless you also had it in consumption. 
 Comrade Trotskyreproached me for “extraordinary forgetfulness” and“intimidation” (pp. 
 67 and 68), and I am surprised to find that he has not accused me also of manoeuvring, diplomatic moves, etc. 
 He has made “concessions” to my equalitarianline, but I have attacked him. 
 Actually, however, anyone who takes an interest in Party affairs, can turn to indisputable Party documents: the November resolution of the C. 
C. 
 Plenum, point 4, and Trotsky’s platform pamphlet, thesis 41. 
 However“forgetful” I may be, and however excellent ComradeTrotsky’s memory, it is still a fact that thesis 41 containsa theoretical error, which the C. 
C. 
 resolution of November9 does not. 
 The resolution says: “While recognising the necessity of keeping to the principle of priority in carrying out the economic plan, the Central Committee, in completesolidarity with the decisions of the last All-Russia Conference(September), deems it necessary to effect a gradual butsteady transition to equality in the status of various groupsof workers and their respective trade unions, all the while building up the organisation on the scale of the union as a whole. 
” That is clearly aimed against Tsektran, and itis quite impossible to put any other construction on the exactmeaning of the resolution. 
 Priority is here to stay. 
Preference is still to be given to enterprises, trade unions,trusts and departments on the priority list (in regard to fulfilment of the economic plan), but at the same time, the “equalitarian line”—which was supported not by “ComradeLenin alone”, but was approved by the Party Conference and the Central Committee, that is, the entire Party —makes this clear-cut demand: get on with the gradual but steadytransition to equalisation. 
 That Tsektran failed to carry out this C. 
C. 
 resolution (November) is evident from the Central Committee’s December resolution (on Trotsky andBukharin’s motion), which contains another reminder ofthe “principles of ordinary democracy”. 
 The theoreticalerror in thesis 41 is that it says: equalisation in consumption,priority in production. 
 That is an economic absurdity because it implies a gap between production and consump-tion. 
 I did not say—and could never have said—anythingof the sort. 
 If you don’t need a factory, close it down. 
 Closedown all the factories that are not absolutely essential,and give preference to those that are. 
 Give preference to,say, transport. 
 Most certainly. 
 But the preference must not be overdone, as it was in Tsektran’s case, which was why the Party (and not just Lenin) issued this directive: get on with the gradual but steady transition to equality. 
 And Trotsky has no one but himself to blame for having come out—after the November Plenary Meeting, which gave a clear-cut and theoretically correct solution—with a factional pamphlet on “the two trends” and proposed aformulation in his thesis 41 which is wrong in economicterms. 
 Today, January 25, it is exactly one month since Comrade Trotsky’s factional statement. 
 It is now patent that thispronouncement, inappropriate in form and wrong in essence,has diverted the Party from its practical economic andproduction effort into rectifying political and theoreticalmistakes. 
 But, it’s an ill wind, as the old saying goes. 
 Rumour has it that some terrible things have been said about the disagreements on the Central Committee. 
Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries undoubtedlyshelter (and have sheltered) behind the opposition, and itis they who are spreading the rumours, incredibly mali-cious formulations, and inventions of all sorts to malign the Party, put vile interpretations on its decisions, aggra-vate conflicts and ruin its work. 
 That is a political trickused by the bourgeoisie, including the petty-bourgeoisdemocrats, the Mensheviks and the Socialist-Revolution-aries, who, for very obvious reasons, hate—and cannot helphating—the Bolsheviks’ guts. 
 Every intelligent member of the Party is familiar with this political trick, and knows its worth. 
 Because of the disagreements on the Central Committee, it had to appeal to the Party, and the discussions thatfollowed clearly revealed the essence and scope of thesedisagreements. 
 That killed the rumours and the slander. 
 The Party learns its lessons and is tempered in the struggle against factionalism, a new malaise (it is new in the sensethat after the October Revolution we had forgotten allabout it). 
 Actually, it is an old malaise, with relapsesapparently bound to occur over the next few years, but withan easier cure now well in sight. 
 The Party is learning not to blow up its disagreements. 
 Let me quote at this point Comrade Trotsky’s correctremark about Comrade Tomsky: “I have always said —even when the polemic against Comrade Tomsky was at its bitterest—that it is quite clear to me that only men with his experience and authority ought to be our trade union leaders. 
 I told this to the Party group of the FifthConference of the Trade Unions, and repeated it at the Zimintheatre a few days ago. 
 Ideological struggle within the Partydoes not mean mutual ostracism but mutual influence ” 27 (p. 
 34 of the report on the December 30 discussion). 
 The Party will naturally apply this correct approach to Comrade Trotsky himself. 
 During the discussion it was Comrade Shlyapnikov and his group, the so-called Workers’ Opposition, who showedthe most pronounced syndicalist trend. 
 This being anobvious deviation from communism and the Party, we shall have to reckon with it, talk it over, and make a special propaganda effort to explain the error of these views andthe danger of making such mistakes. 
 Comrade Bukharin,who actually coined the syndicalist phrase “mandatorynominations” (by trade unions to management bodies)tries to vindicate himself in today’s issue of Pravda , but I’m afraid his line of defence is highly ineffective and quite wrong. 
 He wants us to know, you see, that he dealswith the role of the Party in his other points. 
 I shouldthink so! If it were otherwise it would have been more thanjust a mistake , requiring correction and allowing some slight rectification: it would have been withdrawal from the Party. 
 When you say “mandatory nominations” but neglect to add, there and then, that they are not mandatory for the Party, you have a syndicalist deviation, and that isincompatible with communism and the Party Programme. 
If you add: “mandatory but not for the Party” you are giving the non-Party workers a false sense of having some increase in their rights, whereas in fact there will be no change at all. 
 The longer Comrade Bukharin persists in his deviationfrom communism—a deviation that is wrong theoreticallyand deceptive politically—the more deplorable will be the fruits of his obstinacy. 
 You cannot maintain an untenable proposition. 
 The Party does not object to the extension of the rights of the non-Party workers in general, but a little reflection will show what can and what cannotbe done in this respect. 
 In the discussion by the Communist group of the Second All-Russia Miners ‘ Congress, Shlyapnikov’s platform was defeated despite the backing it got from Comrade Kiselyov, who commands special prestige in that union: our platformwon 137 votes, Shlyapnikov’s, 62, and Trotsky’s, 8. 
 Thesyndicalist malaise must and will be cured. 
 In this one month, Petrograd, Moscow and a number of provincial towns have shown that the Party responded to the discussion and has rejected Comrade Trotsky’s wrong line by an overwhelming majority. 
 While there may havebeen some vacillation “at the top” and “in the provinces”,in the committees and in the offices, the rank-and-filemembership—the mass of Party workers—came out solidlyagainst this wrong line. 
 Comrade Kamenev informed me of Comrade Trotsky’s announcement, during the discussion in the Zamoskvo-rechye District of Moscow on January 23, that he waswithdrawing his platform and joining up with the Bukharingroup on a new platform. 
 Unfortunately, I heard nothingof this from Comrade Trotsky either on January 23 or 24, when he spoke against me in the Communist group of the Miners’ Congress. 
 I don’t know whether this is due to anotherchange in Comrade Trotsky’s platform and intentions, orto some other reason. 
 In any case, his January 23 announce-ment shows that the Party, without so much as musteringall its forces, and with only Petrograd, Moscow and a minority of the provincial towns going on record, has corrected Comrade Trotsky’s mistake promptly and withdetermination. 
 The Party’s enemies had rejoiced too soon. 
 They have not been able—and will never be able—to take advantageof some of the inevitable disagreements within the Party to inflict harm on it and on the dictatorship of the prole-tariat in Russia. 
 January 25, 1921 Published as a pamphlet Published according in January 1921 to the pamphlet text by the Press Department collated with the manuscript of the Moscow Soviet of Workers’, Peasants’ and Red Army Deputies SPEEC H DELIVERED AT AN ENLARGE D CONFERENCE OF MOSCO W METALWORKERS FEBRUAR Y 4, 192128 I regret that I am unable to participate in the work of your Conference and that I must confine myself to a brief statement of my views. 
 From the speeches the comrades have delivered here I gather that you want to know all about the sowing campaign. 
 Very many people think that there is somethingtricky about the Soviet government’s policy towards thepeasants. 
 Our policy in this sphere is one that we are always ready to reveal to the masses. 
 The fundamental problem of the Soviet power is that our own victories have not yetbeen followed by victories in other countries. 
 If you giveour Constitution a careful reading, you will see that we havenot made any fantastic promises, but insist on the needfor dictatorship, because the whole bourgeois world is against us. 
 We are told: the peasants’ condition is not the same as that of the workers, there is some trick in this. 
 But it is one that we have openly proclaimed. 
 Anyone who has stopped to think of the relation of forces between ourselves and the bourgeoisie knows that they are stronger; yet, for three years, they have been unable to crush us. 
 That is not a miracle; we do not believe inmiracles. 
 The simple truth is that they cannot unite, andare quarrelling over the division of the spoils. 
 Most of theoppressed countries are colonies, and a minority live ontheir labour, but atop a volcano. 
 They are stronger, but the movement is growing over there as well. 
 The capitalists have a stronger militaryforce, but they have had a set-back, and we say: the worst is over, but the enemy will make further attempts. 
 Of the Europeans who have visited us none has claimed that his country could have avoided the rags and the queues; and they all agree that, after six years of war, even Britainwould have been in a similar state. 
 We must do our best to establish proper relations between the workers and the peasants. 
 The peasants are anotherclass. 
 We shall have socialism when there are no classes, when all the means of production belong to the working people. 
 We still have classes, it will take many, manyyears to abolish them, and only a quack will promise todo it overnight. 
 The peasants prefer to go it alone, eachone on his own farm, and with his own stock of corn. 
 Thisgives them power over everybody. 
 An armed enemy is lying in wait for us, and if we are to prevent him from overthrowing us, we must establish proper relations betweenthe workers and the peasants. 
 If you take the workers and the peasants, you will find that the latter are more numerous. 
 The capitalists claimto have a democracy under which workers and peasants enjoy equal rights. 
 So long as the peasants follow the bourgeoisie and the workers are isolated, they will bedefeated. 
 If we forget that, the capitalists will beat us. 
We have not promised equality, and we have not got it. 
There can be no equality so long as one has plenty of cornand the other has none The capitalists realised that you can share out the land, but not the factories. 
 We have a dictatorship of the prole-tariat, a term that scares the peasants, but it is the onlymeans of uniting them and making them follow the leadof the workers. 
 We believe this is the correct solution,and the working class will succeed in uniting the peasantry. 
 Only then will the road be open to further advance towards the abolition of classes What is the policy of the American capitalists? They are doling out land, and the peasants follow them and arelulled by their talk of equality. 
 Either you are duped inthis fashion, or you see through it, unite with the workers and drive out the capitalists. 
 This is our policy, and you will find it in our Constitu-tion. 
 I was told here that we ought to review the sowing campaign plans. 
 I know that this spring the peasants are having it very bad. 
 For the workers, the worst is over. 
 We have not promised equality to anyone: if you want to be with the workers, come with us, come over to the socialistside; if not, go over to the Whites. 
 We never promiseda liberal regime; the one we have has helped us to escapethe bondage of the landowners and capitalists. 
 Duringthese three years the workers starved and froze, and took over the idle factories. 
 But they also got the power. 
 Even the peasants in the fertile areas came to see the differencebetween the workers’ rule and Denikin’s, and they havemade their choice. 
 Our victory over Denikin was not amiracle; it was due to the fact that even the rich peasantsrealised what the Constituent Assembly had come to; this drove home the point that the proof of the pudding was in the eating. 
 The peasants realised that the more territory the Whites seized, the more peasants would be drafted into the army,and as soon as enough of them had been collected in thearmy, they overthrew Denikin. 
 We do not promise a land flowing with milk and honey. 
 But over there you are promised equality, and get saddledwith a landowner. 
 That is why we won. 
 We are told we ought to review our plans for the sowing campaign. 
 I say: nobody has suffered as much as the workers. 
During this period, the peasants received land and could obtain corn. 
 This winter the peasants are in desperate straits and their discontent is understandable. 
 Let us review the relations between the workers and the peasants. 
 We have said that the workers have madeincredible sacrifices. 
 This year the peasants are in a terribleplight, and we know it. 
 We are not opposed to reviewing these relations. 
 What is the main goal of the sowing cam-paign? It is to sow all the land, otherwise we are surelydoomed. 
 Do you know how much grain has been takenfrom the peasants this year? About three hundred millionpoods. 
 What would the working class have done withoutit? Even so it starved. 
 We know that the conditions of the peasants are hard, but there is no other way out of the situation. 
 We have completely suspended the surplusgrain appropriation system in thirteen gubernias. 
 Last year we supplied eight million poods of seed grain, and after the harvest we got back six million poods. 
 Now we have supplied approximately fifteen million. 
 To cancel the sowing campaign would be like jumping out of a fifthstorey window. 
 We cannot promise the peasants to relievethem of want at a stroke; to do that our factories wouldhave to multiply their output a hundredfold. 
 If we did not give the workers even the short ration they are now getting, industry would have ground down to a stop. 
 It is true that for three years the workers got nothing at all. 
 But there is no cure-all. 
 The working class has been exhausted by these three years, and this spring will be a very hard one for the peasants. 
 But you help us with the sowing campaign—to sow all the fields—then we shall manage to overcome ourdifficulties. 
 In Hungary, the peasants failed to help the Hungarian workers and fell under the power of the landowners. 
 There is the alternative before you. 
 What is the way out of this difficult situation? It is to concentrate efforts on the sowing campaign, point out the mistakes, and makecorrections; otherwise there is no way out of the difficulties. 
 First published Published according in full in 1927 to a typewritten copy of the minutes SPEEC H DELIVERED AT THE FOURT H ALL-RUSSIA CONGRESS OF GARMEN T WORKERS FEBRUAR Y 6, 192129 Comrades, it gives me great pleasure to greet your Congress on behalf of the Central Committee of our Party and of the Council of People’s Commissars. 
 What gives meeven greater pleasure is your unanimous decision of yes-terday, following the happy reconciliation and successfulresolution of the conflict and the friction among you, which required such strenuous efforts from all, and some from our Party as well. 
 I am sure, comrades, that this slightclash and its successful settlement will be an earnest thatin your future work, as members of the union and of theParty, you will be able to solve all the numerous difficultiesand problems that still lie ahead of us. 
 Comrades, speaking of the position of our Republic in general—of the internal and external position of theSoviet power—the greatest difficulties that confronted uswere, of course, those of our external positions. 
 The greatestdifficulties of the entire proletarian revolution in Russiaarose from our having had to take the initiative in the socialist revolution due to the course of the imperialist war and the preceding development of the first revolutionin 1905; this imposed unprecedented difficulties on us, andon our country. 
 You all know, of course—I think that inyour branch of industry this is more evident to you thanto the workers of other industries—you all know to what extent capital is an international force, to what extent all the big capitalist enterprises, factories, shops, etc. 
,all over the world are linked up together; this makes it obvious that in substance capital cannot be completely defeated in one country. 
 It is an international force, and in order to rout it the workers must also make a concerted effort on an international scale. 
 Ever since 1917, whenwe fought the bourgeois-republican governments in Russia,and ever since the power of the Soviets was establishedat the end of 1917, we have been telling the workers againand again that the cardinal task, and the fundamental condition of our victory is to spread the revolution to, at least, a few of the most advanced countries. 
 And ourmain difficulties over the past four years have been due tothe fact that the West European capitalists managed tobring the war to an end and stave off revolution. 
 We in Russia had particularly striking evidence of the extremely precarious position of the bourgeoisie during the imperialist war. 
 We also heard that in all other countriesit was the end of the war that marked the intensificationof the political crisis, for then the people were armed andit was an opportune moment for the proletariat to havedone with the capitalists at one stroke. 
 For a number of reasons the West European workers failed to do this, and for nearly four years now we have had to defend our po-sitions single-handed. 
 As a consequence, the difficulties that fell to the lot of the Soviet Republic of Russia were without number,because the military forces of the capitalists of the whole world (vastly superior to our own, of course) did all they possibly could to help our landowners. 
 We know full wellof the incredible hardships and privations the working classof Russia has had to bear, but if we are emerging todayfrom more than three years of successfully repulsing theirmilitary invasions and overcoming their obstructions, we have a perfect right to say without any exaggeration that the worst of our difficulties are behind us. 
 If in spite oftheir overwhelming military superiority, the capitalistsof the world have failed to crush this weak and backwardcountry in the course of three years, it was only becausewe have had the dictatorship of the proletariat and enjoyed the massive sympathy of the working people all over the world, we can safely say, in every country without exception. 
And if the capitalists of the whole world have failed in their attempt to crush Soviet Russia, which was not a hard task for them because of their enormous military superiority, we can say, I repeat, that in the international sphere, the greatest danger-point of the whole Soviet revolution ispast, the worst difficulties are over. 
 The danger is still there, of course; the negotiations for final peace are still dragging on and there are signsthat a rather difficult period in these negotiations is setting in, for the French imperialists, in particular, are pressing on with their efforts to push Poland into another war,and are spreading all sorts of false rumours about SovietRussia not wanting peace. 
 Actually, we have done everything to prove that we do; we signed the provisional terms several months ago, and they were such that everyone was surprised by our spirit of compromise. 
 We are not going back on any point of theseterms, but we shall certainly refuse to be soaked underthe pretext of a division of the property which under tsarismhad belonged to the Polish and to the Russian people, whichat the time both groaned under the yoke of tsarism. 
 That is something we cannot have. 
 We accept a fair division of the property, which is to be regarded as common, anda part of the railway property, and consider as indisputablethe need to restore to the Polish people all objects of culturalvalue to which they attach especial importance, and whichhad been stolen and carried off to Russia in the days of the tsar. 
 We have always anticipated that difficult problems would arise in the settlement of this matter; but if underthe pressure of the French imperialists the Poles want tocreate a conflict and sabotage peace at all costs, there isnothing we can do about it. 
 If there is to be peace, goodwill must be shown on both sides, whether in the case of a very serious conflict within a separate alliance or between two states. 
 If the Poles once again yield to the pressure ofthe French imperialists, then, I repeat, the effort to con-clude peace may be frustrated. 
 You are well aware, ofcourse, what new difficulties will confront us if the Frenchimperialists succeed in sabotaging this peace; and we all know from a number of sources and reports that attempts are being made and enormous efforts are being exerted tothis end, and that the foreign capitalists are spending millions upon millions to organise another invasion of Soviet Russia in the spring. 
 We now have over three years’ experience of the way these invasions are organised. 
 We know that unless they have the aid of a neighbouring state,the foreign capitalists cannot hope to organise anythinglike a serious expedition, and the millions they have beenhanding out to the various groups headed by Savinkov,or to the group of Socialist-Revolutionaries who are publish-ing their newspaper in Prague 30 and sometimes speak in the name of the Constituent Assembly, these millionswill go down the drain, and they will have nothing to showfor it but a lot of spoiled newsprint and wasted ink invarious printing offices in Prague. 
 But there are countries like Rumania, which has not tried to fight Russia, and Poland, which is ruled by an exploiting class and a military clique of adventurers. 
 Weknow that they cannot muster large forces against us, butwe also know that what we prize most is peace and an op-portunity to devote all our efforts to restoring our economy. 
So we must be extremely careful. 
 We have the right to tell ourselves that the worst difficulties in international politics are behind us, but it would be extremely thoughtless toshut our eyes to the possibility of fresh attempts. 
 Of course,now that we have eliminated the Wrangel front, and Ruma-nia had not risked war when the odds were on her side, itis hardly likely that she will risk it now, but we must not forget that the ruling classes in Rumania and Poland are in a position which may be said to be bordering on the des-perate. 
 Both countries have been sold to foreign capitalistslock, stock, and barrel. 
 Both are up to their ears in debt,and have no means of paying up. 
 Their bankruptcy isinevitable. 
 The revolutionary movement of the workers and peasants is growing steadily. 
 Bourgeois governments in such straits have been known to rush headlong into thecraziest adventures, for which there was no other expla-nation but their desperate and hopeless situation. 
 Thatis why we must still reckon with the possibility of freshattempts at armed invasion. 
 Our conviction that these attempts will be frustrated, and that the position of the capitalist powers all over theworld is, generally speaking, precarious, springs chiefly from the mounting economic crisis in all countries, and the growth of the communist working-class movement. 
 In Europe, the revolution has not been following the same lines as ours. 
 As I have said, the workers and peasants ofthe West European countries, who were in arms when thewar ended, failed to strike in a swift revolution that wouldhave been the least painful. 
 The imperialist war, however,had so shaken the position of these states that not only has the economic crisis there not yet run its course, but there are signs that in every country without exception,even in the richest and most advanced, it will become evenmore acute next spring. 
 Capital is an international evil,and just because of this all countries find themselves sograppled to each other that when some go down they tend to drag down the rest. 
 The rich countries have naturally waxed richer: during the war their capitalists piled up huge profits. 
 But in theoverwhelming majority of the European countries, tradehas been dislocated and disrupted owing to the completedevastation not only of Russia, but even of Germany, and owing to the depression and the currency depreciation. 
 The richest countries are suffocating, being unable to selltheir industrial goods because of the depreciating currency,unemployment is growing to incredible proportions every-where, and an unprecedented economic crisis is loomingall over the world. 
 Meanwhile, the working class—which its capitalists had bribed by giving sizable hand-outs from their profits tothe upper strata of the working class to entice it awayfrom the revolution—is recovering from its blindness afterthe three-and-a-half-year war against Soviet Russia, whilethe communist movement is growing steadily and taking on depth not only in the parties, but also in the trade unions all over the world, although not as fast as we should like. 
The ruling classes all over the world are particularly ap-prehensive of the changes that are taking place in the tradeunion movement. 
 In Europe, they are not afraid of theprospect of facing a party that could lead the revolutionary proletariat, as was the case in the Russian revolution, when in the course of a few months, no, weeks, the Party wastransformed from an illegal one into one commanding nation-wide forces, and backed by millions of people. 
 Europe has not had such a party for years. 
 But every capi-talist sees the trade unions, and knows that they unite millions of workers and that the machinery of capitalismis bound to break down, unless the capitalists controlthem through the leaders who call themselves socialistsbut pursue the policy of the capitalists. 
 This they know,feel and sense. 
 The most telltale fact, for instance, was that in Germany the whole bourgeois press and the whole press of the social-traitors meeting in the Second Inter-national and calling themselves socialists, but loyallyserving the capitalists, was whipped into a frenzy not somuch because of Zinoviev’s visit to Germany, as of that ofthe Russian trade unionists, for no one has stirred up the German trade unions to such an extent as they did on their first short visit to that country. 
 This savage fury of theGerman bourgeois press and all the Communist-hating capi-talists shows how precarious their position is. 
 An inter-national, world-wide struggle has flared up for influencewith the trade unions, with millions of members in all civilised countries, for on them depends this inner work, which is not always readily perceptible. 
 The inexorablegrowth of the economic crisis is deciding the fate of thecapitalist countries. 
 The attempted coup 31 by the German monarchist party was thwarted by the resistance of the German trade unions, when the workers who had followed Scheidemann and the murderers of Liebknecht and Luxemburg rose and crushedthe military forces. 
 As the economic crisis gains momentum,we find the same thing happening in Great Britain, andto a large extent in America as well. 
 That is why it is theinternational situation that gives us most hope and con-viction that the internal situation in the capitalist countries tends to sap all of their strength, and that our internationalposition, which was difficult yesterday and remains suchtoday, despite our great successes, will undoubtedly improve,and that we shall be able to devote all our efforts to solvingour internal tasks. 
 I shall not enlarge on these tasks, because all of you who are engaged in industry are more familiar with the tasks of construction than I am, and it wouldbe superfluous for me to deal with them at length. 
 I heard the final remark made by the preceding speaker, and I join him in saying that every member must now concentrate most attention on the practical tasks of produc-tion and economic construction now before us. 
 The tradeunions now unite nearly all the industrial workers; theyunite the class that has borne the brunt of the burden ofthe past three years. 
 In Russia, the working class is exer-cising its dictatorship; it is the ruling class in a country where workers are in a minority. 
 But it is precisely because the working class is ruling the country and because theworkers had borne the brunt of capitalist exploitation,that it is assured of the sympathy and massive support ofthe working peasantry and all those who do not live on thelabour of others. 
 This explains what is a sealed book not only to the capitalists but also to the socialists who have remained enemies of the Third International, and whatthey take to be a trick on the part of our government. 
 Theycannot understand how the working class could fight onfor three years, against enormous odds, and beat them. 
But the majority of the peasants must support the working class because the workers have come to power for the first time in history, and because power has been taken by theclass that had been most exploited. 
 They have realisedthat the working class is right, and have withdrawn theirsupport from the bourgeoisie, which, by the way, theyregard as a term of abuse. 
 I met a peasant who complained about present conditions and was obviously not in sympathy with the Soviet government’s food policy, and certain otherissues. 
 The poor peasants of his district had called hima “bourgeois”, and he felt this to be an affront. 
 “I refuseto be called by such a disgraceful name,” he said. 
 Andthere is a world of meaning in the fact that this term has come to be regarded as an odious one by the peasants— even the well-to-do middle peasants who have workedwith their own hands, who know what it takes to earna living, and who have been exploited by landowners andcapitalists (and that is something they have all experienced). 
It is the basis of our propaganda and agitation, and the influence exercised by the working class through the state. 
 It is this support of the peasant masses that the workingclass is assured of in spite of the resistance of the rich and profiteering crowd. 
 And that is why our trade unions are not only associations of working people, not only the build-ers of our economy—that is their main task—but also a political force building a new state without landownersand capitalists. 
 Although a minority, they can and willbuild a new communist society, because we are assuredof the support of the millions upon millions of those whohave always lived by their own labour. 
 In greeting your Congress, I want to say that I am quite sure that we shall succeed in our tasks despite all the difficulties confrontingus.

 Verbatim Report ), Petrograd INSTRUCTIONS OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE TO COMMUNISTS WORKING IN THE PEOPLE’S COMMISSARIAT FOR EDUCATION 1. 
 Unreservedly adhering to the position de fined by the Programme of the R. 
C. 
P. 
 in regard to polytechnical education (see, in particular, §§1 and 8 of the section dealing with education), the Party must regard the lowering ofthe age for general and polytechnical education fromseventeen to fifteen as only a practical expedient necessitatedby the country’s poverty and ruin caused by the warsimposed upon us by the Entente. 
 Vocational training for persons of fifteen years of age and upwards “in conjunction with ... general polytechnicaleducation” (§8 mentioned above) is absolutely compulsoryall over the country, wherever there is the slightest oppor-tunity to introduce it. 
 2. 
 The main failing of the People’s Commissariat for Education is its lack of practical efficiency, inadequate attention to the recording and verification of practicalexperience, lack of systematic application of its lessons,and prevalence of general arguments and abstract slogans. 
The People’s Commissar and the Collegium must concentrateon combating these defects. 
 3. 
 The enlistment of specialists, i. 
e. 
, of teachers with theoretical and long practical experience, and of personshaving such experience in technical (including agronomic)vocational training for work at the centre, is improperlyorganised in the People’s Commissariat for Education ingeneral, and in Glavprofobr, * in particular. 
 *The Chief Administration for Vocational Training under the People’s Commissariat for Education. 
— Tr. 
 The registration of such workers, the study of their experience, the verification of the results of their work, and their systematic enlistment for responsible posts in local, and specially central, work must be organised immediately. 
Not a single serious measure should be carried out withoutcanvassing the opinion of these specialists and obtainingtheir continued co-operation. 
 It goes without saying that the enlistment of specialists must be carried out under these two indispensable con-ditions: first, specialists who are not Communists mustwork under the control of Communists; secondly, Commu-nists alone must determine the content of the curricula, inso far as this concerns general educational subjects, andparticularly philosophy, the social sciences and communist education. 
 4. 
 Curricula for the main types of educational establish-ments and for courses, lectures, readings, colloquia andpractice periods must be drawn up and endorsed by thecollegium and the People’s Commissar. 
 5. 
 The Standard Labour School Department, and, in particular, Glavprofobr, must devote greater attention to the wider and more systematic enlistment of all suitabletechnical and agronomic forces for the promotion oftechnical vocational and polytechnical education and to theutilisation for that purpose of every tolerably well-organised industrial and agricultural enterprise (state farm, agricultural experimental station, well-organised farm, etc. 
, electric power stations, etc. 
). 
 To avoid disruption of normal operations, the forms and the order in which economic enterprises and establish-ments are to be used for polytechnical education are to bedetermined by agreement with the economic agencies concerned. 
 6. 
 Clear, concise and practical forms of reporting must be devised to make it possible to estimate the scale andverify the results of the work. 
 The organisation of thiswork in the People’s Commissariat for Education is highlyunsatisfactory. 
 7. 
 The distribution of newspapers, pamphlets, magazines and books to libraries and reading-rooms in schools andelsewhere is also highly unsatisfactory. 
 The result is that newspapers and books reach only a small section of Soviet office workers and extremely few factory workers and peasants. 
 This whole system must be reorganised from top to bottom. 
 Pravda No. 
 25, February 5, 1921 Published according to the manuscript THE WORK OF THE PEOPLE’S COMMISSARIAT FOR EDUCATION Pravda No. 
 25 of February 5 carried “ Instructions of the Central Committee of the R. 
C. 
P. 
 to Communists Working in the People’s Commissariat for Education (inconnection with the reorganisation of the Commissariat)”. 
 Unfortunately, there are three misprints in Point 1 distorting the meaning: the text said “political” instead of“polytechnical” education. 
 I should like to draw our comrades-’ attention to these instructions and to call for an exchange of opinion on someof the more important points. 
 A five day Party Conference on educational questions was held in December 1920. 
 It was attended by 134 dele-gates with voice and vote, and 29 with voice. 
 A report of its proceedings is given in a Supplement to the Bulletin of the Eighth Congress of Soviets on the Party Conference on Education (published by the All-Russia Central Execu-tive Committee, January 10, 1921). 
 The resolutions ofthe Conference, the report of the proceedings, all the articlespublished in the above-mentioned Supplement —except for the introductory article by Comrade Lunacharsky and the article by Comrade Grinko—reveal a wrong approach topolytechnical education. 
 They suffer from the very defecton combating which the Central Committee in its instruc-tions urges the People’s Commissar and the Collegiumto concentrate their attention, namely, too many general arguments and abstract slogans. 
 The question of polytechnical education has in the main been settled by our Party Programme in its paragraphs 1 and 8 of the section dealing with the people’s education. 
 It is these paragraphs that are dealt with in the Central Committee’s Instructions. 
 Paragraph 1 deals with polytech-nical education up to the age of seventeen; and Paragraph 8 speaks of “the extensive development of vocational trainingfor persons of the age of seventeen and upwards in conjunction with general polytechnical education ”. 
 Thus, the Party Programme puts the question squarely. 
 The arguments about “polytechnical or monotechnical edu-cation” (the words I have put in quotes and italics, mon-strously absurd though they are, are the very words thatwe find on page 4 of the Supplement ) are fundamentally wrong and downright impermissible for a Communist;they betray ignorance of the Programme and an idle incli-nation for abstract slogans. 
 While we are temporarily compelled to lower the age (for passing from general poly-technical education to polytechnical vocational training)from seventeen to fifteen, the “ Party must regard ” this lowering of the age “as only” (point 1 of the Central Com-mittee’s Instructions) a practical expedient necessitated by the “ country ’s poverty and ruin ”. 
 General arguments with futile efforts to “substantiate” this lowering are claptrap. 
 Let us stop this game of generalarguments and “theorising”! Attention must be concen-trated on the “recording and verification of practical experience” and the “systematic application of its lessons ”. 
 We may have very few competent people with knowledge and practical pedagogical experience but we do have some. 
We suffer from our inability to find them, install them inthe proper executive posts, and join them in studying the practical experience of Soviet state development. 
 Now this is precisely what the Party Conference in December 1920 failed to do, and if this was not done at a conferenceof 163—one hundred and sixty-three!—educational workers,it is quite evident that there must be a general, fundamen-tal flaw in the organisation of this work, which madeit necessary for the Party’s Central Committee to issue special instructions. 
 In the Commissariat for Education there are two—just two—comrades who have special assignments. 
 These are the People’s Commissar, Comrade Lunacharsky, who exer-cises general direction, and Deputy Commissar, Comrade Pokrovsky, who directs affairs, firstly, as Deputy People’s Commissar, and secondly, as official adviser (and director)on scientific matters and questions of Marxism in general. 
The whole Party knows both Comrade Lunacharsky andComrade Pokrovsky very well and has no doubt, of course,that in this respect both are, in their way, “specialists” in the People’s Commissariat for Education. 
 None of the other workers of the Commissariat can afford to “ specialise ” in this way: their “speciality” must lie in skilfully organis-ing the enlistment of expert teachers, in organising theirwork properly, and in systematically applying the lessonsof practical experience. 
 The Central Committee’s instruc-tions refer to this in points 2, 3 and 5. 
 The Party workers’ conference should have heard reports by specialists—teachers with some ten years’ practicalexperience—who could have told us what is being doneand has been done in the various spheres, say, vocationaltraining, how we are coping with it in our Soviet organi-sation, what has been achieved, illustrated with examples (which could surely be found, even if in small number),what were the main defects, and how these could be removed,stated in concrete terms. 
 The Party workers’ conference made no such record of practical experience, and heard no teachers on their appli-cation of this experience; but fatuous efforts were made to produce “general arguments” and appraise “abstractslogans”. 
 The whole Party, all the workers of the People’sCommissariat for Education, must realise this defect andcorrect it in a common effort. 
 Local workers should ex-change experience and help the Party to give publicity to the exemplary gubernias, uyezds, districts, schools, or expert teachers who have achieved good results ina relatively narrow, local or special field. 
 Taking asa basis the achievements that have stood the test ofpractice, we must press on and, after proper verification,apply this local experience on a nation-wide scale, promoting talented, or simply capable, teachers to more responsible posts, giving them a wider sphere of activity,etc. 
 The touchstone of a Communist’s work in education (and educational institutions) should be his efforts in organising the enlistment of specialists, his ability to find them, utilise their knowledge, secure the co-operationof expert teachers with the Communist leadership, andverify what and how much is being done . 
 He must show ability to make progress—even if very slowly and on avery small scale—so long as it is achieved in practical matters, on the basis of practical experience. 
 But we shall not move forward if the People’s Commissariat for Educa-tion continues to be full of people who pretend to provide“Communist leadership” while there is a vacuum in thepractical sphere, a shortage, or total lack, of practicalspecialists, inability to promote them, hear what they have to say and take account of their experience. 
 The Communist leader must prove his claim to leadership by recruiting a growing number of experienced teachers to help him,and by showing his ability to help them in their work, to promote them , and take account of and bring out their experience. 
 In this sense the invariable slogan must be: less “leader-ship”, more practical work, that is to say, fewer generalarguments and more facts, and I mean verified facts,showing where, when and what progress we are making orwhether we are marking time, or retreating. 
 The Communistwho is a real leader will correct the curricula drawn up by the experienced teachers, compile a good textbook and achieve practical , even if slight, improvements in the content of the work of a score , a hundred , or a thousand expert teachers. 
 But there is not much use in the Communistwho talks about “leadership”, but is incapable of enlisting any specialists for practical work, getting them to achieve practical results in their work, and utilising the practical experience gained by hundreds upon hundredsof teachers. 
 That this is the main flaw in the work of the People’s Commissariat for Education is evident from a paging throughthe fine booklet, The People ’s Commissariat for Education. 
 October 1917 -October 1920 . 
 Brief Report. 
 Comrade Luna-charsky admits this when he refers in the preface (p. 
 5) tothe “obvious lack of the practical approach”. 
 But much more effort will be needed to drive this home to all the Communists in the People’s Commissariat for Education and make them practise these truths. 
 This booklet shows that our knowledge of the facts is poor, very poor indeed;we do not know how to collect them; we are unable to judgehow many questions we ought to raise and the number ofanswers we can expect to get (taking into considerationour level of culture, our customs, and our means of com-munication). 
 We don’t know how to collect evidence of practical experience and sum it up. 
 We indulge in empty“general arguments and abstract slogans”, but do not knowhow to utilise the services of competent teachers, in general,and of competent engineers and agronomists for technicaleducation, in particular; we don’t know how to utilise factories, state farms, tolerably well-organised enterprises and electric power stations for the purpose of polytechnicaleducation. 
 In spite of these defects, the Soviet Republic is making progress in public education; there is no doubt about that. 
There is a mighty urge for light and knowledge “down below”, that is to say, among the mass of working people whom capitalism had been hypocritically cheating outof an education and depriving of it by open violence. 
 Wecan be proud that we are promoting and fostering thisurge. 
 But it would be a real crime to ignore the defects inour work, and the fact that we have not yet learned properly to organise the state apparatus of education. 
 Take also the distribution of newspapers and books, the question dealt with in the last point of the CentralCommittee’s Instructions, point 7. 
 The Council of People’s Commissars issued its decree on “The Centralisation of Libraries” (p. 
 439, Collection of Statutes , 1920, No. 
 87) on November 3, 1920, providing for the creation of a single network of libraries of the R. 
 S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
 Here are some of the data I have been able to obtain on the question from Comrade Malkin of the Central PeriodicalsAdministration, and from Comrade Modestov of the LibrarySection of the Moscow Department of Education. 
 In 38 gubernias, 305 uyezds, the number of libraries in central So-viet Russia (excluding Siberia and North Caucasus) was asfollows: Central libraries ....... 
 342 District urban ” ....... 
 521 Volost ” ....... 
 4,474 Travelling ” ....... 
 1,661 Village reading-rooms ....... 
. 
 14,739 Miscellaneous ( “rural juvenile reference, libraries of various institutions and organ-isations ”)............ 12, 203 Total ....... 
 33,940 Comrade Modestov believes, on the basis of his expe-rience, that about three-quarters of this number actuallyexist, while the rest are only listed as such. 
 For MoscowGubernia, the Central Periodicals Administration givesthe figure of 1,223 libraries, while Comrade Modestov’s figure is 1,018; of these 204 are in the city proper and 814 in the gubernia, not counting the trade union libraries(probably about 16) and the army libraries (about 125). 
 As far as can be judged from a comparison of the different gubernias, these figures are not very reliable—let us hopethe actual figure does not turn out to be under 75 per cent! In Vyatka Gubernia, for example, there are 1,703 village reading-rooms, in Vladimir Gubernia—37, in PetrogradGubernia—98, in Ivanovo-Voznesensk Gubernia—75, etc. 
Of the “miscellaneous” libraries there are 36 in PetrogradGubernia, 378 in Voronezh Gubernia, 525 in Ufa Gubernia,31 in Pskov Gubernia, etc. 
 These figures seem to show that the thirst for knowledge among the mass of workers and peasants is tremendous,and that the striving for education and the establishmentof libraries is mighty and “popular” in the real sense ofthe word. 
 But we are still very short of ability in organising,regulating, shaping and properly satisfying this popular urge. 
 Much remains to be done in creating a real integrated network of libraries. 
 How are we distributing the newspapers and books? According to the Administration’s 1920 figures for elevenmonths, we distributed 401 million copies of newspapersand 14 million books. 
 Here are the figures for three news-papers (January 12, 1921), compiled by the Periodicals Section of the Central Administration for the Distributionof Books.

e. 
, the really mas-sive distribution, is astonishingly small, as against theenormous figures for the “establishments”, etc. 
, in thecapital, evidently the papers grabbed and bureaucrati-cally utilised by “Soviet bureaucrats”, both military and civilian. 
 Here are a few more figures taken from the reports of the local branches of the Central Periodicals Administra-tion. 
 In September 1920, its Voronezh Gubernia branchreceived newspapers twelve times (that is to say, there wereno papers on eighteen of the thirty days in September). 
 Those received were distributed as follows: Izvestia (to branches of the C. 
P. 
A. 
): uyezd—4,986 copies (4,020; 4,310) *; district—7,216 (5,860; 10,064); volost—3,370 (3,200; 4,285);Party organisations—447 (569; 3,880); Soviet establish-ments—1,765 (1,641; 509)—note that Soviet establishmentsreceived nearly three times as many copies of Pravda as Party organisations! Then follow: Agitation and Educa-tional Department of the Military Commissariat—5,532(5,793; 12,332); agitation centres—352 (400; 593); villagereading-rooms— nil. 
 Subscribers—7,167 (3,080; 764). 
 Thus, “subscribers” (actually, of course, “Soviet bureaucrats”)received a fat slice. 
 Public reading stands—460 (508; 500). 
 Total: 32,517 (25,104; 37,237). 
 *First figure— Pravda , second, Bednota . 
 In November 1920, Ufa Gubernia received 25 consign-ments, that is to say, there was no delivery on five days only. 
 Distribution: Party organisations—113 (1,572; 153); Soviet establishments—2,763 (1,296; 1,267); Agitation andEducational Department of the Military Commissariat—687 (470; 6,500); Volost Executive Committees—903 (308;3,511); village reading-rooms—36 ( Pravda —8, eight copies! —2,538); subscribers— nil; “various uyezd organisations”— 1,044 (219; 991). 
 Total: 5,841 (4,069; 15,429). 
 Lastly, the report of the branch in Pustoshensk Volost, Sudogoda Uyezd, Vladimir Gubernia for December 1920. 
Party organisations—1 (1; 2); Soviet offices—2 (1; 3);Agitation and Educational Department of the MilitaryCommissariat—2 (1; 2); Volost Executive Committees—2 (1; 3); post and telegraph offices—1 (1; 1); Urshelsky Works Committee—1 (1; 2); District Department of Social Main-tenance—1 (0; 3). 
 Total: 10 (6; 16). 
 What is the conclusion to be drawn from these fragmen-tary data? I believe it is what our Party Programme says,namely: “Only the first steps in the transition from capital-ism to communism are being taken ... at the present time. 
 Under capitalism, a newspaper is a capitalist enterprise, a means of enrichment, a medium of information and enter-tainment for the rich, and an instrument for duping andcheating the mass of working people. 
 We have smashed thisinstrument of profit-making and deceit. 
 We have begun to convert the newspapers into an instrument for educating the masses and for teaching them to live and run theireconomy without the landowners and capitalists. 
 But we are only at the start of the road. 
 Not much has been doneduring the last three years or so. 
 A great deal remains tobe done: the road ahead is very long indeed. 
 Let us have less political fireworks, fewer general arguments and abstract slogans from inexperienced Communists who failto understand their tasks; let us have more productionpropaganda and, above all, more efficient and capableapplication of practical experience to fit the developmentof the masses. 
 We have abolished newspaper subscriptions (I have no data on the distribution of books; there the situation isprobably even worse). 
 This is a step from capitalism to communism. 
 But capitalism cannot be killed at one stroke; it rears its head in the form of “Soviet bureaucrats” grabbing the newspapers on various pretexts—they must be grabbing a great number, though we cannot say just how manyThere must be a sustained drive in this field against theSoviet bureaucrats, who must be “rapped over theknuckles” for grabbing books and newspapers. 
 Their share—and they themselves—must be steadily reduced. 
 Unfortuna-tely, we are unable to slash their number down to one-tenth, or one-hundredth—it would be a fraud to promise this atour present level of culture, but we can and must whittleit down. 
 No real Communist will fail to do this We must see to it that books and newspapers are, as a rule, distributed gratis only to the libraries and reading-rooms, which provide a proper reading service for the whole country and the whole mass of workers, soldiersand peasants. 
 This will accelerate, intensify and makemore effective the people’s eager quest for knowledge. 
That is when education will advance by leaps and bounds. 
 Here is some simple arithmetic by way of illustration: there are 350,000 copies of Izvestia and 250,000 copies of Pravda for the whole of Russia. 
 We are poor. 
 We have no newsprint. 
 The workers are short of fuel, food, clothesand footwear. 
 The machines are worn out. 
 The buildingsare falling apart. 
 Let us assume that we actually have forthe country as a whole—that is some 10,000 odd volosts— 50,000 libraries and reading-rooms. 
 This would give no less than three for each volost, and certainly one for each factoryand military unit. 
 Let us further assume that we have notonly learned to take “the first step from capitalism to com-munism”, but also the second and the third. 
 Let us assumethat we have learned to distribute three copies of newspapers to every library and reading-room, of which, say, two go on the “public reading stands” (assuming that we havetaken the fourth step from capitalism to communism,I make the bold assumption that instead of pasting news-papers on walls in the barbarous way which spoils them, wefix them with wooden pegs—we have no metal tacks, and there will be a shortage of metal even at the “fourth step”!— to a smooth board for convenient reading and to keep thepapers from spoiling). 
 And so, two copies each for 50,000 libraries and reading-rooms for “pasting up” and one copy to be kept in reserve. 
 Let us also assume that we have learned to allow the Soviet bureaucrats, the pampered “grandees” of the Soviet Republic, a moderate number of newspapers for them to waste, let us say, no more than afew thousand copies. 
 On these bold assumptions the country will have a much better service with 160,000, or, say, 175,000 copies. 
 The papers will be there for everyone to read the news (if the “travelling libraries” which, in my opinion, ComradeF. 
 Dobler so successfully defended in Pravda just the other day, are properly organised 33). 
 All this needs is 350,000 copies of two newspapers. 
 Today, there are 600,000 copies,a large part of which is being grabbed by the “Soviet bureau-crats”, wasted as “cigarette paper”, etc. 
, simply through the habits acquired under capitalism. 
 This would give usa saving of 250,000 copies, or, despite our extreme poverty,a saving equal to two dailies with a circulation of 125,000 each. 
 Each of these could carry to the people every dayserious and valuable literary material and the best modern and classical fiction, and textbooks on general educational subjects, agriculture and industry. 
 Long before the war,the French bourgeoisie learned to make money by publish-ing popular fiction, not at 3. 
50 francs a volume for thegentry, but at 10 centimes (i. 
e. 
, 35 times as cheap, 4 kopeksat the pre-war rate) in the form of a proletarian news-paper; why, in that case, can’t we do the same—at the second step from capitalism to communism. 
 Why can’twe do the same thing and learn, within a year, even in ourpresent state of poverty, to give the people two copies of anewspaper through each of the 50,000 libraries and reading-rooms, all the necessary textbooks and world classics, and books on modern science and engineering. 
 We shall learn to do this, I am sure.

 Written on February 8, 1921 Published according First published in 1932 to the manuscript LETTER ON OIL CONCESSIONS To Members of the Political Bureau and Comrade Rykov, Stalin, Bukharin, Kamenev, Krestinsky, Rykov We are in receipt of replies to the Political Bureau’s query concerning oil concessions both from Krasin (and Bogda-tyan) and Chairman of Glavneft * Dosser and his four experts. 
 In connection with the report, The State of the Oil Indus-try by the End of 1920 (Baku, 1920), I am sending these replies on to Comrade Stalin, and request all members ofthe Political Bureau to ring him up to obtain all this materialand read it in good time. 
 (All you have to do with regardto the printed report is to read through what I have markedoff with a blue pencil on the pages listed on the cover, that is, on the page before the text. 
) This material needs to be read urgently, because it is desirable to have a Political Bureau decision (8. 
00 p.

 Mon-day, February 14). 
 The material gives ample proof that: (a) disaster is imminent ; (b) everything must be done to lease out the concessions in Baku (that is, find the concessionaires); (c) the Glavneft Chairman is extremely stupid. 
 Stupid-ity in such high quarters is a menace. 
 These three points summed up: (a) Disaster is looming. 
 This point is driven home by the Glavneft experts . 
 The fool Dosser tries to mi-*Chief Oil Industry Administration.

 nimise the danger in his “memo”. 
 That is the height of stupidity. 
 The opinions of all the Glavneft experts should be read and compared with Dosser’s toned-down conclusion. 
 (b) Dosser formulates his conclusion as follows: “There is doubtful benefit in inviting a concessionaire. 
” It looksas though he has, like the truly well-intentioned fool thathe is, scared his experts into believing that an anti-concession stand is the only decent one to take for a “Soviet” citizen. 
 That’s a really “good turn” he hasdone us! In the practical plane, the reports of the Glavneft experts (which are business-like and are strictly borne outby the “end of 1920” printed report) clarify the kind of terms we should lay down for the concessionaire. 
 It is, of course, “doubtful” whether a concessionaire can be found on these terms. 
 But no politician in his rightmind would consult Dosser or the experts on that. 
 It is up to us to make every effort to find such conces-sionaires. 
 If we don’t, so much the worse for us. 
 If we fail to make an all-out effort to find a concession-aire, we shall find ourselves bankrupt. 
 The working out of the terms must be speeded up. 
An immediate start must be made in fighting a highly dangerous prejudice which could easily carry a section of the workers and which must be debunked at any cost. 
 It is this “idea”: “We don’t want to work for the capitalists”,or its variant, “We don’t want to work for the capitalistswhen workers nearby are not doing it”. 
 The harm of it (refuted by the R. 
C. 
P. 
 Programme and Marxism in general) is evident from this rough calculation, which epitomises the conclusion given in the experts’ reports. 
 We are extracting 100 a of oil. 
 Output is dropping. 
Flooding threatens disaster. 
If we get a concessionaire, who will help to extract 100a$100b of oil, and if we have to pay him 98 b for this, our output will rise, instead of dropping, even if ever soslowly (100 a$2b). 
 Here is the question: are the workers who give the con-cessionaire 98 b out of the 100 b working for “the capitalists” or for the Soviet power? There is no difficulty about the answer. 
Please go over the enclosed material and reports urgently, to allow us to take a decision as soon as possible. 
 Thereis extreme danger in any delay. 
 February 12, 1921 Lenin First published in 1945 Published according in Lenin Miscellany XXXV to the manuscript INTEGRATED ECONOMIC PLAN What is being said and written on this subject leaves a very painful impression. 
 Take L. 
 Kritsman’s articles inEkonomicheskaya Zhizn 35 (I—December 14, 1920; II— December 23; III—February 9; IV—February 16; and V—February 20). 
 There is nothing there but empty talkand word-spinning, a refusal to consider and look intowhat has been done in this field. 
 Five long articles of reflec-tion on how to approach the study of facts and data, insteadof any actual examination of them. 
 Take Milyutin’s theses ( Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn , Feb-ruary 19), or Larin’s (ibid. 
, February 20); listen to thespeeches of “responsible” comrades: they all have the samebasic defects as Kritsman’s articles. 
 They all reveal thedullest sort of scholasticism, including a lot of twaddleabout the law of concatenation, etc. 
 It is a scholasticism that ranges from the literary to the bureaucratic, to the exclusion of all practical effort. 
 But what is even worse is the highbrow bureaucratic disdain for the vital work that has been done and thatneeds to be continued. 
 Again and again there is the emptiest“drawing up of theses” and a concoction of plans and slogans, in place of painstaking and thoughtful study of our own practical experience. 
 The only serious work on the subject is the Plan for the Electrification of the R. 
 S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
, the report of GOELRO (the State Commission for the Electrification of Russia)to the Eighth Congress of Soviets, published in December 1920 and distributed at the Congress. 
 It outlines an inte-grated economic plan which has been worked out—only asa rough approximation, of course—by the best brains in the Republic on the instructions of its highest bodies. 
 We have to make a very modest start in fighting the complacency born of the ignorance of the grandees, and the intellectualist conceit of the Communist literati, by tellingthe story of this book, and describing its content andsignificance . 
 More than a year ago—February 2-7, 1920—the All-Russia Central Executive Committee met in session andadopted a resolution on electrification which says: “Along with the most immediate, vital and urgent tasks in organising transport, coping with the fuel and food crises, fightingepidemics, and forming disciplined labour armies, Soviet Russia nowhas, for the first time, an opportunity of starting on more balancedeconomic development, and working out a nation-wide state economicplan on scientific lines and consistently implementing it. 
 In view of the prime importance of electrification ... mindful of the importance of electrification for industry, agriculture and transport, ... and so onand so forth ..., the Committee resolves: to authorise the Supreme Economic Council to work out, in conjunction with the People’sCommissariat for Agriculture, a project for the construction of asystem of electric power stations.... 
” This seems to be clear enough, doesn’t it? “A nation-wide state economic plan on scientific lines”: is it possibleto misread these words in the decision adopted by ourhighest authority? If the literati and the grandees, whoboast of their communism before the “experts”, are ignorantof this decision it remains for us to remind them that ignorance of our laws is no argument. 
 In pursuance of the All-Russia C. 
E. 
C. 
 resolution, the Pre-sidium of the Supreme Economic Council, on February 21,1920, confirmed the Electrification Commission set upunder the Electricity Department, after which the Councilof Defence endorsed the statute on GOELRO, whose compo-sition the Supreme Economic Council was instructed to determine and confirm by agreement with the People’sCommissariat for Agriculture. 
 On April 24, 1920, GOELROissued its Bulletin No. 
 1, 36 containing a detailed pro-gramme of works and a list of the responsible persons,scientists, engineers, agronomists and statisticians on the several subcommissions to direct operations in the various areas, together with the specific assignments each hadundertaken. 
 The list of persons and their assignments runs to ten printed pages of Bulletin No. 
 1. 
 The best talent available to the Supreme Economic Council, the People’s Commissariat for Agriculture and the People’s Commis-sariat for Communications has been recruited. 
 The GOELRO effort has produced this voluminous— and first-class—scientific publication. 
 Over 180 specialistsworked on it. 
 There are more than 200 items on the listof works they have submitted to GOELRO. 
 We find, first, a summary of these works (the first part of the volume, running to over 200 pages): a) electrification and a stateeconomic plan; followed by b) fuel supply (with a detailed“fuel budget” for the R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
 over the next ten years , with an estimate of the manpower required); c) waterpower; d) agriculture; e) transport; and f) industry. 
 The plan ranges over about ten years and gives an indi-cation of the number of workers and capacities (in 1,000 hp). 
Of course, it is only a rough draft, with possible errors,and a “rough approximation”, but it is a real scientificplan. 
 We have precise calculations by experts for everymajor item, and every industry. 
 To give a small example, we have their calculations for the output of leather, foot-wear at two pairs a head (300 million pairs), etc. 
 As a result,we have a material and a financial (gold rubles) balance-sheet for electrification (about 370 million working days,so many barrels of cement, so many bricks, poods of iron,copper, and other things; turbine generator capacities, etc. 
). 
 It envisages (“at a very rough estimate”) an 80 per cent increase in manufacturing, and 80-100 per cent, inextracting industry over the next ten years. 
 The goldbalance deficit ( $11,000 million — 17,000 million leaves a total deficit of about 6,000 million) “can be covered bymeans of concessions and credit operations”. 
 It gives the site of the first 20 steam and 10 water power district electric stations, and a detailed description of theeconomic importance of each. 
 The general summary is followed, in the same volume, by a list of works for each area (with a separate paging):Northern, Central Industrial (both of which are especially well set out in precise detail based on a wealth of scientific data), Southern, Volga, Urals? Caucasian (the Caucasusis taken as a whole in anticipation of an economic agreement /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR between its various republics), Western Siberia and Turke-stan. 
 For each of the areas, electric power capacities are projected beyond the first limits; this is followed by the “GOELRO Programme A”, that is, the plan for the useof existing electric power stations on the most rational and economic lines. 
 Here is another small example: it is esti-mated that a grid of the Petrograd stations (Northern Area)could yield the following economy (p. 
 69): up to one-half of the capacities could be diverted to the logging areas of the North, such as Murmansk and Archangel, etc. 
 The result-ing increase in the output and export of timber could yield“up to 500 million rubles’ worth of foreign exchange a year in the immediate period ahead ”. 
 “Annual receipts from the sale of our northern timber could very well equal our gold reserves over the next few years” (ibid. 
, p. 
 70), provided, of course, we stop talkingabout plans and start studying and applying the plan already worked out by our scientists. 
 Let me add that we have an embryonic calendar programme for a number of other items (though not for all, of course). 
 This is more than a general plan: it is an estimate for each year, from 1921 to 1930, of the number of stations thatcan be run in, and the proportions to which the existingones can be enlarged, provided again we start doing whatI have just said, which is not easy in view of the ways ofour intellectualist literati and bureaucratic grandees. 
 A look at Germany will bring out the dimensions and value of GOELRO’s effort. 
 Over there, the scientist Ballodproduced a similar work: he compiled a scientific planfor the socialist reconstruction of the whole nationaleconomy of Germany. 
 37 But his being a capitalist country, the plan never got off the ground. 
 It remains a lone-wolf effort, and an exercise in literary composition. 
 With us over here it was a state assignment, mobilising hundredsof specialists and producing an integrated economic plan onscientific lines within 10 months (and not two, of course,as we had originally planned). 
 We have every right to beproud of this work, and it remains for us to understand how it should be used. 
 What we now have to contend with is failure to understand this fact . 
 The resolution of the Eighth Congress of Soviets says: “The Congress ... approves the work of the Supreme Eco-nomic Council , etc. 
, especially that of GOELRO in drawing up the plan for the electrification of Russia ... regards this plan as the first step in a great economic endeavour , author-ises the All-Russia Central Executive Committee, etc. 
,to put the finishing touches to the plan and to endorse it , at the very earliest date .... 
 It authorises the adoption of all measures for the most extensive popularisation of this plan .... 
 A study of this plan must be an item in the cur-ricula of all educational establishments of the Republic , without exception ”, 38 etc. 
 The bureaucratic and intellectualist defects of our appa-ratus, especially of its top drawer, are most glaringlyrevealed by the attitude to this resolution taken by some people in Moscow and their efforts to twist it, to the extent of ignoring it altogether. 
 Instead of advertising the plan,the literati produce theses and empty disquisitions on howto start working out a plan. 
 The grandees, in purely bureau-cratic fashion, lay stress on the need to “approve” the plan,by which they do not mean concrete assignments (the dates for the construction of the various installations, the purchase of various items abroad, etc. 
) but some muddled idea,such as working out a new plan. 
 The misunderstanding this produces is monstrous, and there is talk of partiallyrestoring the old before getting on with the new. 
 Electri-fication, it is said, is something of an “electrification”. 
 Why not gasification, we are asked; GOELRO, they also say, is full of bourgeois specialists, with only a handfulof Communists; GOELRO should provide the cadre ofexperts, instead of staffing the general planning commis-sion, and so forth. 
 The danger lies in this discord, for it betrays an inability to work, and the prevalence of intellectualist and bureau-cratic complacency, to the exclusion of all real effort. 
 Theconceited ignoramus is betrayed by his jibes at the “fan-tastic” plan, his questions about gasification, etc. 
 The nerveof their trying, offhand, to pick holes in something it tookan army of first-class specialists to produce! Isn’t it a shame to try to shrug it off with trite little jokes, and to put on airs about one’s right “to withhold approval”? It is time we learned to put a value on science and got rid of the “communist” conceit of the dabbler and the bureaucrat; it is time we learned to work systematically, making use of our own experience and practice. 
 Of course, “plans” naturally give rise to endless argu-ment and discussion, but when the task is to get down tothe study of the only scientific plan before us, we shouldnot allow ourselves to engage in general statements anddebates about underlying “principles”. 
 We should get down to correcting it on the strength of practical experience and a more detailed study. 
 Of course, the grandees alwaysretain the right to “give or withhold approval”. 
 A soberview of this right, and a reasonable reading of the resolu-tion of the Eighth Congress concerning the approval of theplan, which it endorsed and handed down to us for the broadest popularisation, show that approval must be taken to mean the placing of a series of orders and the issueof a set of instructions, such as the items to be purchased,the building to be started, the materials to be collected andforwarded, etc. 
 Upon the other hand, “approval” from thebureaucratic standpoint means arbitrary acts on the part of the grandees, the red-tape runaround, the commissions-of-inquiry game, and the strictly bureaucratic foul-up ofanything that is going. 
 Let us look at the matter from yet another angle. 
 There is a special need to tie in the scientific plan for electrifica-tion with existing short-term plans and their actual imple-mentation. 
 That this must be done is naturally beyond doubt. 
 But how is it to be done? To find out, the econo-mists, the literati, and the statisticians should stop theirtwaddle about the plan in general, and get on with a de-tailed study of the implementation of our plans, our mistakesin this practical business, and ways of correcting them. 
 Otherwise we shall have to grope our way long. 
 Over and above such a study of our practical experience, there remainsthe very small matter of administrative technique. 
 Ofplanning commissions we have more than enough. 
 Taketwo men from the department under Ivan Ivanovich andintegrate them with one from the department under Pavel Pavlovich, or vice versa. 
 Link them up with a subcommis-sion of the general planning commission. 
 All of which boilsdown to administrative technique. 
 Various combinations should be tried out, and the best selected. 
 That is elemen-tary. 
 The whole point is that we have yet to learn the art of approach, and stop substituting intellectualist andbureaucratic projecteering for vibrant effort. 
 We have, andhave had, short-term food and fuel plans, and there areglaring mistakes in both. 
 That is unquestionable. 
 Butthe efficient economist, instead of penning empty theses, will get down to a study of the facts and figures, and analyse our own practical experience. 
 He will pin-point themistakes and suggest a remedy. 
 This kind of study willsuggest to the efficient administrator the transfers, altera-tions of records, recasting of the machinery, etc. 
, to beproposed or put through. 
 You don’t find us doing anything of the sort. 
 The main flaw is in the wrong approach to the relation-ships between the Communists and the specialists, theadministrators and the scientists and writers. 
 There isno doubt at all that some aspects of the integrated economicplan, as of any other undertaking, call for the administra-tive approach or for decisions by Communists alone. 
 Let me add that new aspects of that kind can always come tothe fore. 
 That, however, is the purely abstract way of look-ing at it. 
 Right now, our communist writers and admini-strators are taking quite the wrong approach, because theyhave failed to realise that in this case we should be learning- all we can from the bourgeois specialists and scientists, and cutting out the administrative game. 
 GOELRO’s isthe only integrated economic plan we can hope to have justnow. 
 It should be amplified, elaborated, corrected andapplied in the light of well scrutinised practical experience. 
The opposite view boils down to the purely “pseudo-radical conceit, which in actual fact is nothing but ignorance”, as our Party Programme puts it. 
 39 Ignorance and conceit are equally betrayed by the view that we can have anothergeneral planning commission in the R. 
S.

R. 
 in additionto GOELRO, which, of course, is not to deny that someadvantage may be gained from partial and business-like changes in its membership. 
 It is only on this basis—by continuing what has been started—that we can hope tomake any serious improvements in the general economic plan; any other course will involve us in an administrative game, or high-handed action, to put it bluntly. 
 The task of the Communists inside GOELRO is to issue fewer orders, rather, to refrain from issuing any at all, and to be verytactful in their dealings with the scientists and techni-cians (the R. 
C. 
P. 
 Programme says: “Most of them inevitablyhave strong bourgeois habits and take the bourgeois viewof things”). 
 The task is to learn from them and to help them to broaden their world-view on the basis of achieve-ments in their particular field, always bearing in mindthat the engineer’s way to communism is different from that of the underground propagandist and the writer; he is guidedalong by the evidence of his own science , so that the agrono-mist, the forestry expert, etc. 
, each have their own path to tread towards communism. 
 The Communist who has failed to prove his ability to bring together and guide the workof specialists in a spirit of modesty, going to the heart ofthe matter and studying it in detail, is a potential menace. 
We have many such Communists among us, and I wouldgladly swap dozens of them for one conscientious qualified bourgeois specialist. 
 There are two ways in which Communists outside GOELRO can help to establish and implement the inte-grated economic plan. 
 Those of them who are economists,statisticians or writers should start by making a study ofour own practical experience, and suggest corrections and improvements only after such a detailed study of the facts. 
 Research is the business of the scientist, and once again,because we are no longer dealing with general principles,but with practical experience, we find that we can obtainmuch more benefit from a “specialist in science and tech-nology”, even if a bourgeois one, than from the conceited Communist who is prepared, at a moment’s notice, to write “theses”, issue “slogans” and produce meaningless abs-tractions. 
 What we need is more factual knowledge andfewer debates on ostensible communist principles. 
 Upon the other hand, the Communist administrator’s prime duty is to see that he is not carried away by the issuing of orders. 
 He must learn to start by looking at the achievements of science, insisting on a verification of thefacts, and locating and studying the mistakes (through reports, articles in the press, meetings, etc. 
), before pro-ceeding with any corrections. 
 We need more practical studies of our mistakes, in place of the Tit Titych40 type of tactics (“I might give my approval, if I feel like it”). 
 Men’s vices, it has long been known, are for the most part bound up with their virtues. 
 This, in fact, appliesto many leading Communists. 
 For decades, we had beenworking for the great cause, preaching the overthrow of the bourgeoisie, teaching men to mistrust the bourgeois specialists, to expose them, deprive them of power andcrush their resistance. 
 That is a historic cause of world-wide significance. 
 But it needs only a slight exaggerationto prove the old adage that there is only one step from thesublime to the ridiculous. 
 Now that we have convinced Russia, now that we have wrested Russia from the exploiters and given her to the working people, now thatwe have crushed the exploiters, we must learn to run thecountry. 
 This calls for modesty and respect for the efficient“specialists in science and technology”, and a business-likeand careful analysis of our numerous practical mistakes, and their gradual but steady correction. 
 Let us have less of this intellectualist and bureaucratic complacency, and adeeper scrutiny of the practical experience being gainedin the centre and in the localities, and of the availableachievements of science.

 I am sure that the alliance between the poor peasants and Ukrainian workers willstrengthen Soviet Ukraine and consolidate the UkrainianRepublic, despite the enemy’s traps and machinations. 
 I have asked Comrade Petrovsky to convey my regret at being unable to accept your invitation to attend the Congress. 
 Nevertheless, I hope to be able to visit Soviet Ukraine in the near future. 
 I wish the Congress success inconsolidating the power of the workers and peasants and inrestoring the national economy. 
 Yours, Lenin Kommunist (Kharkov) No. 
 45, Published according February 27, 1921 to the Kommunist text SPEEC H AT A PLENAR Y MEETING OF THE MOSCO W SOVIE T OF WORKERS’ AND PEASANTS ’ DEPUTIES FEBRUAR Y 28, 192142 (Prolonged applause . 
) Before going on to the domestic situation—a subject which, quite naturally, arouses great interest and much concern—let me run over the salientinternational developments. 
 To be brief, I shall deal withonly three. 
 The first is our conference with Turkish dele-gates which has opened here in Moscow. 
 43 This is an espe-cially welcome fact, because there had been many obstacles to direct negotiations with the Turkish Government dele-gation, and now that there is an opportunity of reachingan understanding here in Moscow, we feel sure that a firmfoundation will be laid for closer relations and friendship. 
Of course, this will not be achieved through diplomaticmachinations (in which, we are not afraid to admit, our adversaries have the edge on us), but through the fact that over the past few years both nations have had to endureuntold suffering at the hands of the imperialist powers. 
A previous speaker referred to the harm of isolation fromthe imperialist countries. 
 But when a wolf attacks a sheep,there is hardly any point in advising the sheep to avoid isolation from the wolf. 
 ( Laughter , applause . 
) Up to now, the Eastern peoples may have been like sheep before the imperialist wolf, but Soviet Russia was the first to showthat, despite her unparalleled military weakness, it isnot so easy for the wolf to get his claws and teeth into her. 
This example has proved to be catching for many nations, regardless of whether or not they sympathise with the “Bolshevik rumour-mongers”. 
 We are a popular topic allover the world, and, in relation to Turkey, have even been described as malicious rumour-mongers. 
 Of course, we have so far been unable to do anything in this sphere, but the Turkish workers and peasants have demonstrated that the resistance on the part of modern nations to plunder isa thing that has to be reckoned with: Turkey herself resistedplunder by the imperialist governments with such vigourthat even the strongest of them have had to keep theirhands off her. 
 That is what makes us regard the current negotiations with the Turkish Government as a very great achievement. 
 We have no hidden motives. 
 We know thatthese negotiations will proceed within a very modest frame-work, but they are important because the workers andpeasants of all countries are drawing steadily closertogether, despite all the formidable obstructions. 
 This is something we should bear in mind when assessing our present difficulties. 
 The second thing worth recalling in connection with the international situation is the state of the peace talksin Riga. 
 44 You know that in order to conclude a peace with any degree of stability we have been making the great-est possible concessions to all the states formerly within the Russian Empire. 
 This is very natural because nationaloppression is one of the main factors which arouses hatredfor the imperialists and unites the peoples against them,and few states in the world have sinned as much in thisrespect as the old Russian Empire and the bourgeois republic of Kerensky, the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries in alliance with the bourgeoisie. 
 That is why it is in respectof these nations that we have shown the greatest willing-ness to make concessions and readiness to accept such peaceterms, for which some Socialist-Revolutionaries havevirtually called us Tolstoyans. 
 We don’t care, because we have to show the greatest willingness to compromise with these nations, to dispel the age-old suspicions gen-erated by the old oppression, and to lay the foundationfor a union of workers and peasants of various nationswhich once suffered together at the hands of tsarism andthe Russian landowners, and now suffer at the hands of imperialism. 
 In respect of Poland, this policy has been largely frustrated by the Russian whiteguards, Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, who enjoy “freedom of the press”, “freedom of speech” and other wonderful “free-doms”, alongside the extraordinary freedom of the French and other capitalists to buy up a larger part of Poland, where they are at liberty to spread their propaganda in aneffort to push Poland into a war against us. 
 The capitalistsare now doing their utmost to disrupt the peace that hasbeen concluded. 
 One of the reasons why we cannot demobi-lise our army, as we should like to do, is that we must reckon with the possibility of war on a much larger scale than some people imagine. 
 Those who say that we need notput so much into defence are wrong, because our enemiesare resorting to all sorts of machinations and intrigues tobreak up the final peace with Poland, the provisional termsof which have already been signed. 
 These negotiations have lately been dragging on, and although a few weeks ago things had come to such a pass that there was reason to feara serious crisis, we recently decided to make some furtherconcessions, not because we thought they were warranted,but because we considered it necessary to thwart the in-trigues of the Russian whiteguards, Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks in Warsaw, and of the Entente imperialists, who are making the greatest efforts to prevent peace. 
 Ithas not yet been signed, but let me say that we have everyreason to be optimistic: it will be signed in the near future,and we shall succeed in thwarting the intrigues againstits conclusion. 
 Although this is only guesswork on my part, I believe the prospect will gladden us all. 
 But let us not count our chickens before they are hatched. 
 That iswhy we shall not slacken or weaken our military efforthowever slightly, but we shall not be afraid to make a fewmore concessions to bourgeois Poland, so as to wrest theworkers and peasants of Poland from the Entente and prove to them that the workers’ and peasants’ government does not deal in national strife. 
 We shall defend this peaceeven at the price of considerable sacrifice. 
 The third international question is the events in the Caucasus. 
 There have been large-scale developments thererecently, and although we do not yet know the details their implication is that we are on the brink of a major war. 
 We were, of course, disturbed at the clash between Armeniaand Georgia, for these events turned the Armenian-Georgian war into an insurrection, with a section of the Russian troops taking part. 
 The upshot of all this was that, for the time being, the tables have been turned on the Armenian bourgeoi-sie, which had been scheming against us, so that, accordingto the latest but still unconfirmed reports, Soviet powerhas been established in Tiflis. 
 ( Applause . 
) We know that the insurrection began in the neutral zone of Armenia,which lies between Georgia and Armenia, and which Georgia had occupied with the consent of the Entente imperialists. 
 When the Mensheviks, particularly the GeorgianMensheviks, speak of the harm of isolation from the Westernpowers, they usually mean the reliance on the Ententeimperialists, who are stronger than anyone else. 
 But somewhiteguards tend to forget that the advanced capitalists are more deceitful than anyone else, and say to them-selves: can Armenia, the Armenian peasants, etc. 
, or theravaged Soviet Republic be compared to the united impe-rialist powers of the world? Let us turn to the advancedcapitalists for they are the civilised forces of the world. 
That is how the Georgian Mensheviks seek to justify their unseemly defence of the capitalists, and they had control of the only railway line, the Armenian peasants’ food supplyline. 
 No one will have the patience to read all the telegrams, statements and protests we exchanged with Georgia onthis question. 
 If we had had a peace treaty with Georgia, our policy would have been to procrastinate as long as possible. 
 You must understand, however, that the Arme-nian peasants did not view the treaty question in that light,and things culminated in the terrible insurrection whichbroke out in early February and spread with astonishingrapidity, involving not only Armenians, but also Georgians. 
 There has been hardly any news from over there, but our assumptions have been borne out by the latest availablereport. 
 We know perfectly well that the Georgian bourgeoi-sie and the Georgian Mensheviks do not rely for supporton their working people, but on their capitalists, who areonly looking for a pretext to start hostilities. 
 Upon the other hand, we have had our stake on the working people for three years and we shall continue to have it on themto the last even in this backward and oppressed country. 
 With all our circumspection and all our efforts to strength-en the Red Army, we shall ultimately do everything possible to put out the flames in the Caucasus. 
 We shall demonstrate in the East what we have been able to demon-strate in the West: when Soviet power is in, nationalOppression is out. 
 On this, in the final analysis, dependsthe outcome of the struggle, and because of their superiornumbers the workers and peasants will ultimately prove to be stronger than the capitalists. 
 Let me now turn from foreign policy to home affairs. 
 I have been unable, unfortunately, to hear the whole ofComrade Bryukhanov’s report. 
 He has given you the factsin detail and I need not go over that again. 
 I want to dealwith the main thing, which may possibly show us the causes of our terrible crisis. 
 We shall have to set ourselves a task and find a way to solve it. 
 There is a path, we have foundit, but we are not yet strong enough to follow it with thepersistence and the regularity demanded by the difficultpost-war conditions. 
 We are in every respect poverty-stricken, and yet we are no more destitute than the workers of Vienna. 
 They and their children are starving and dying, but they have not the main thing that we have: they haveno hope. 
 They are dying, crushed by capitalism; they arein a position where they have to endure sacrifices, but notas we do. 
 We make sacrifices for the war which we havedeclared on the whole capitalist world. 
 That is the differ-ence between the position of the workers of Petrograd and Moscow and that of the workers of Vienna. 
 Now, inthe spring, our hardships due to the food shortage have onceagain become more acute, after the improvement earlieron. 
 The fact is that we had miscalculated. 
 When the planfor surplus-food appropriation was drawn up, we thought we could improve on our success. 
 The people had gone-hungry for so long that their condition had to be improvedat all costs. 
 It was essential not only to help, but to improvethings. 
 We had failed to see that if we improved thingsthen, we should be hard pressed later on, and it was dueto this mistake that we now face a food crisis. 
 We have made the same mistake elsewhere: in the Polish war, and in fuel. 
 The procurement of food and fuel—coal, oil, fire-wood—are all different types of work, but in all three we have made identical mistakes. 
 At the time of the severest hardships, we overestimated our resources and failed to take stock of them properly. 
 We failed to realise that we were using up our resources all at once, we failed to estimateour reserves, and we put nothing by for a rainy day. 
 Thisis, generally speaking, a good rule of thumb that anypeasant follows in his simple, everyday economy. 
 But therewe were, acting on a nation-wide scale as if we gave no thought to the reserves so long as we had enough for today, so that when we were finally faced with and brought up shortby this question of reserves we were quite unable to putanything by for a rainy day. 
 During the Polish war we had a vigorous, daring Red Army, but we advanced too far—to the very gates of Warsaw, and then had to roll back, almost to Minsk. 
 The same thing has happened with the food supply. 
 True enough,we emerged from the war as victors. 
 In 1920, we offeredthe Polish landowners and bourgeoisie peace on termsmore advantageous to them than the present terms. 
 Theywere taught a lesson, and the whole world was taught a lesson, which nobody had previously bargained for. 
 When we speak about our position we tell the truth; if anything,we tend to exaggerate the negative side. 
 In April 1920,we said: transport is falling to pieces, there is no food. 
We said this frankly in our newspapers and spoke aboutit openly at mass meetings in the best halls of Moscow and Petrograd. 
 The spies of Europe rushed to cable the news, and over there some people rubbed their hands in glee andsaid: “Get on with the job, you Poles: you see how badlythings are going with them, we shall soon crush them. 
”But we were telling the truth, sometimes tending to exag-gerate the negative side. 
 Let the workers and peasants know that our difficulties are not over. 
 And when the Polish army, with French, British and other military advisersand arms and money, went into battle, it was defeated. 
And now, when we say that our affairs are in poor shape,when our ambassadors report that the whole of the bourgeoispress is saying “The Soviet power is doomed”, when even Chernov has said that it will undoubtedly fall, we say: “You can shout your heads off, that’s what freedom ofthe press on capitalist money is for, you have as much of this freedom as you want, but we are still not in the least afraid to speak the bitter truth. 
” Indeed, the situation this spring has worsened again, and our papers are full of admissions of this bad situation. 
 But we say to the foreigncapitalists, the Mensheviks, the S. 
R. 
s, the Savinkovites, 45 or whatever else they are called: just you try to cash in onthis and you will find yourselves in a far deeper hole. 
(Applause . 
) It is obviously a difficult transition from our state of utter destitution in 1918-19, when it was very hard to think about a year’s reserve or allocation, andwhen all we could do was to look one or two weeks aheadand say “we’ll see” about the third one. 
 It is obviouslydifficult to change over from this situation to that of 1920,when we saw that our army was bigger than that of the Poles, when we had twice as much grain as the previous year, when we had fuel, and when there was one and a halftimes more Donets and Siberian coal. 
 We were unableto distribute this on a nation-wide scale. 
 You must rememberthat annual estimates require a special approach and spe-cial conditions. 
 We knew that the spring would be worse than the autumn, but how much worse, we could not know. 
 It is not a matter of figures or distribution but a matter ofthe degree to which the workers and peasants have starved,and the extent of the sacrifice they are still able to makefor the common cause of all workers and peasants. 
 Who canestimate this? Some may point out this error—it is an error, and we make no effort to conceal the fact, just as we did not conceal it in the case of the Polish war—but let thosewho blame us for it—and justly so—give us an estimatefor projecting the national amount to be set aside from thefirst six months’ grain reserves, so as to leave somethingin stock for the six months after that. 
 No such estimates have been made. 
 We first tried to work out some in 1920 and miscalculated. 
 In certain respects, a revolution isa miracle. 
 If we had been told in 1917 that we would holdout in three years of war against the whole world, that,as a result of the war, two million Russian landowners,capitalists and their children would find themselves abroad, and that we would turn out to be the victors, no one of us would have believed it. 
 A miracle took place because theworkers and peasants rose against the attack of the landowners and capitalists in such force that even powerful capitalism was in danger. 
 But just because of the miracle we lost the habit of taking the long view of things. 
 That is why all of us now have to limp along. 
 The forthcomingParty Congress is to be called earlier, because we need tosum up this new experience in earnest. 
 The defence of theworkers’ and peasants’ power was achieved by a miracle,not a divine miracle—it was not something that fell from the skies—but a miracle in the sense that, no matter how oppressed, humiliated, ruined and exhausted the workersand peasants were, precisely because the revolution wentalong with the workers, it mustered very much more strengththan any rich, enlightened and advanced state could havemustered. 
 But this will not work in economics, where— perhaps the word is not altogether appropriate—you need “thrift”. 
 We have not yet learned to practise “thrift”. 
We must bear in mind that we have defeated the bourgeoi-sie, but that they are still with us and so the struggle goeson. 
 And spreading panic is one of their ways of fighting us. 
We must not forget that they are past masters at it. 
 They have their newspapers, although not printed ones, but splendidly distributed, and they are doing much more thanmaking mountains out of molehills. 
 But under no circum-stances must we succumb to panic. 
 The situation has beenaggravated because we have made mistakes in every fieldof work. 
 Let us not be afraid of these mistakes, let us not be afraid to admit them; let us not indulge in mutual recrim-ination; but if we are to make use of all our resources andput in the greatest effort in every field, we must know howto reckon. 
 Reckoning will give us control of the wholeRepublic, for proper reckoning alone will give us an estimateof the large amounts of available grain and fuel. 
 The bread ration will be short for a lusty appetite, but the amount cannot be increased all at once. 
 There will be a shortageonly if we do not lay in stocks, but we shall have enoughif we make a correct estimate and give to the most needy,and take from those who have large surpluses rather thanfrom those who, over the last three years, may have given away their last crust. 
 Have the peasants of the Ukraine and Siberia seen the point of this reckoning? Not yet,I’m afraid. 
 Their present and past grain surpluses have never been matched in central Russia, nor have they ever experienced such a plight. 
 The peasants of the Ukraine, Siberia and Northern Caucasus have never known such destitution and hunger as the peasants of Moscow and Petro-grad gubernias (who received far less than the Ukrainianpeasants) have endured for three years. 
 Their surplusesusually ran to hundreds of poods, and they were accustomedto receive goods at once for that kind of surplus. 
 There is nowhere to obtain the goods from, now that the factories are at a standstill. 
 To set them going once again willtake time and preparation, and workers. 
 Our tremendoussacrifices are not made in a state of desperation, but ina fight that wins one victory after another. 
 This is a distinc-tion that makes all the difference. 
 That is the main point that I wished to make here, not in terms of the exact figures given by the comrade respon-sible for food supplies and by the comrade responsiblefor fuel, but in terms of economics and politics, to helpunderstand how our recent mistakes differ from earlierones, and while they are different they still have this in common, that we have tried to jump two rungs when we only had the possibility of climbing one. 
 Nevertheless,we are now at a higher stage. 
 That is good. 
 This year weshall have a much better fuel balance than last year. 
 Andlet me give you one final fact in regard to the food supply:the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the republican forces in Siberia has cabled that communications have been restored and that seven train-loads of grain are on their wayto Moscow. 
 At one time there were disturbances and kulakrevolts. 
 Of course, it is possible to joke about rumour-mongers, but it is necessary to appreciate that after all wehave learned a thing or two in the course of the class strug-gle. 
 We know that the tsarist government called us rumour-mongers, but when we speak of the Socialist-Revolutionaryand Menshevik rumour-mongers, we are speaking of anotherclass, of people who support the bourgeoisie and who takeadvantage of every difficulty to issue leaflets and say:“Look, 300 poods of grain surpluses are being confiscated from you; you give everything away, and get nothing in return but coloured bits of paper. 
” Don’t we know theserumour-mongers! What is their class? No matter what they call themselves, Socialist-Revolutionaries, lovers of liberty, of people’s power, constituent assemblies, and so on, they are the same old landowners. 
 We have heard all they have to say and have learned to understand their true meaning. 
These revolts indicate that there are people among thepeasants who do not wish to reconcile themselves either tosurplus food requisitioning or to the tax. 
 Someone here hasmentioned the tax. 
 Much of what he said was common sense, but he should have added that before we said any-thing about it from this platform, the newspaper Pravda , which is the Central Organ of the Russian CommunistParty, carried tax proposals signed not only by casualcontributors but by staff correspondents. 
 46 When the non-Party peasant says to us: “Make your calculations conform to the needs of the small peasant; he needs confi-dence; I shall give so much and then I shall look to my ownaffairs,” we say: “Yes, that is business-like, that is commonsense and is in keeping with local conditions. 
” So long as wehave no machines, so long as the peasant himself has nowish to change over from small-scale to large-scale farming, we are inclined to take this idea into account and we shall place this question before the Party Congress due to be heldin a week’s time, sort it out and take a decision satisfactoryto the non-Party peasant and to the mass of the people. 
In our apparatus there is, of course, much that is imperfectand inexcusable, because a great deal, a very, very great deal of the bureaucratic practices has seeped in. 
 But weren’t there the same kind of mistakes and imperfections in ourRed Army? We could not rid ourselves of them right away,but thanks to the help of the workers and peasants, theArmy was, nevertheless, victorious. 
 What took place inthe Red Army is bound to happen in another form in all spheres, and we shall be cured of these bureaucratic distor-tions—condemned on every hand because they are evidenceof our mistakes and misfortunes—by persistent work, notsuccumbing to panic and not turning a blind eye to thosewho, taking advantage of these mistakes, are trying torepeat the Kolchak and Denikin affairs. 
 Any amount of scandalous practices in the way of the pilfering of coal is taking place in the Ukraine, while here we are sufferingfrom a great shortage. 
 Over there they have had 120 govern-ments, and the rich peasants have been corrupted. 
 They cannot understand that there is a workers’ and peasants’ government and that, if it confiscates grain, it does so in order to ease the position of the workers and peasants. 
Until we are able to achieve full clarity on all thesequestions in that area, we shall continue to receive news ofdisturbances, banditry and revolts. 
 This is inevitablebecause we have inherited from capitalism a peasant who is isolated and cannot help being ignorant and full of resent-ment, and it will take us years to re-educate him. 
 We seethis every spring, and we shall continue to see it everyspring for some time to come. 
 The south-eastern railways are quite another matter. 
 This year we have mainly existed on the resources supplied us by Siberia and the Northern Caucasus. 
 Here is a five-day report. 
 It says 8 cars were sent in every day from February1; the second five-day report gives the figure of 32 cars;the third, 60; the fourth, 109; but we should be receiving200 cars a day, and only in the last five days, from Feb-ruary 20 to 24, have we been getting 120 cars a day. 
 That is three train-loads. 
 Today Comrade Fomin reports that during the past two days we have received four train-loads. 
As one comrade has said, the position in the Donets Basinis that there is no grain because there is no coal, and thereis no coal because there is no grain. 
 This vicious circlemust be broken at some point by the energy, pressure and heroism of the working people, so that all the wheels start turning. 
 We are beginning to emerge from the enormousdifficulties that we have experienced in this respect. 
 A rayof light has appeared. 
 I do not at all wish, comrades, tolull you with promises and I have no intention of announc-ing that this difficult period has ended. 
 Nothing of the sort! There are signs of improvement, but the period remains incredibly difficult, and, in comparison with last autumn,it need not have been as difficult as it is now, despite thefact that we are cut off from Western Europe. 
 In order notto be cut off, we have had to accept the idea of grantingconcessions: here’s your 500 per cent profit, and let’s have more grain, paraffin oil, etc. 
 We are prepared to grant concessions, and will grant them. 
 This will mean a newstruggle, because we are not going to give them 500 per cent, or perhaps even more, without bargaining, and to switch to this struggle is equivalent to switching all our trains onto new rails. 
 For this it is essential to convince the capitalists that they cannot butt in on us with a war. 
 We have decisivelyaccepted the policy of concessions. 
 You know that we havehad many arguments with the peasants and workers aboutthis, you know that the workers have said: “Have we got rid of our own bourgeoisie only to let the foreigners in?” We have explained to them that we cannot switch all atonce from scarcity to abundance, and in order to ease thistransition, in order to obtain the necessary amount ofgrain and textiles, we must be able to make every necessarysacrifice. 
 Let the capitalists benefit from their own greed, so long as we are able to improve the position of the workers and peasants. 
 It is no easy thing, however, to get this con-cession business going. 
 We published a decree about thisin November, but so far not a single concession has beengranted. 
 Of course, this is due to the influence of the white-guard and Menshevik press. 
 Russian newspapers are now published in every country in the world, and in all of them the Mensheviks are clamouring against any concessionsand saying that in Moscow things are not going well, thatthe Soviet power is about to collapse, and that the capital-ists should not believe the Bolsheviks and should havenothing to do with them. 
 But we shall not abandon the fight: we have defeated the capitalists, but we have not destroyed them; they have now moved on to Warsaw,which once used to be the centre of the struggle againstthe Russian autocracy, and is now the rallying point ofthe whiteguards against Soviet Russia. 
 We shall fight themeverywhere, both on the foreign and on the home front. 
 I have here a telegram from Comrade Zinoviev in Petro-grad which says that, in connection with the arrests there,a leaflet found in the possession of one of those detainedmakes it clear that he is a spy of foreign capitalists. 
 Thereis another leaflet, headed To the Faithful , which is also counter-revolutionary in content. 
 Further, Comrade Zino-viev informs us that Menshevik leaflets posted up in Petro-grad call for strikes, and over here in Moscow this has beenblown up into a rumour about some kind of demonstration. 
 In actual fact, one Communist was killed by an agent pro-vocateur, and he is the only victim of these unhappy days. 
 When Denikin was at Orel, the whiteguard papers said he was advancing at almost 100 versts an hour. 
 These paperswill not surprise us. 
 We take a sober view of things. 
 We mustrally closer, comrades. 
 Otherwise, what are we to do? Tryanother Kerensky or Kolchak “coalition” government?Kolchak, let us say, is no longer with us, but another might take his place. 
 There are any number of Russian generals, quite enough for a large army. 
 We must speak frankly andhave no fear of the newspapers being published in all thecities of the world. 
 These are all trifles, and we shall not keepsilent about our difficult position because of them. 
 But weshall say this: comrades, we are carrying on this difficult and bloody struggle, and if at the moment they cannot attack us with guns, they attack us with lies and slander,taking advantage of every instance of need and poverty inorder to help our enemies. 
 I repeat, all of this we haveexperienced and survived. 
 We have lived through fargreater difficulties; we know this enemy extremely well, and we shall defeat him this spring; we shall defeat him by working more successfully, and by calculating morecarefully.

 ORJONIKIDZE March 2, 1921 Sergo Orjonikidze Please convey to the Georgian Communists, and in par-ticular to all members of the Georgian Revolutionary Com-mittee, my warm greetings to Soviet Georgia. 
 My special request to them is to inform me whether or not we are incomplete agreement on the following three questions: First, immediate arming of the workers and poor peasants and formation of a strong Georgian Red Army. 
 Second, there is need for a special policy of concessions with regard to the Georgian intelligentsia and small mer-chants. 
 It should be realised that it is not only imprudentto nationalise them, but that there is even need for certainsacrifices in order to improve their position and enablethem to continue their small trade. 
 Third, it is of tremendous importance to devise an acceptable compromise for a bloc with Jordania or similar Georgian Mensheviks, who before the uprising had not beenabsolutely opposed to the idea of Soviet power in Georgiaon certain terms. 
 Please bear in mind that Georgia’s domestic and interna-tional positions both require that her Communists should avoid any mechanical copying of the Russian pattern. 
 They must skilfully work out their own flexible tactics, basedon bigger concessions to all the petty-bourgeois elements.

 5, Published according March 6, 1921 to the manuscript INTERNATIONAL WORKING WOMEN’S DAY The gist of Bolshevism and the Russian October Revolu-tion is getting into politics the very people who were mostoppressed under capitalism. 
 They were downtrodden, cheat-ed and robbed by the capitalists, both under the monarchy and in the bourgeois-democratic republics. 
 So long as theland and the factories were privately owned this oppressionand deceit and the plunder of the people’s labour by thecapitalists were inevitable. 
 The essence of Bolshevism and the Soviet power is to expose the falsehood and mummery of bourgeois democracy, to abolish the private ownership of land and the factoriesand concentrate all state power in the hands of the workingand exploited masses. 
 They, these masses, get hold of po-litics, that is, of the business of building the new society. 
This is no easy task: the masses arc downtrodden and oppressed by capitalism, but there is no other way—and there can be no other way—out of the wage-slavery andbondage of capitalism. 
 But you cannot draw the masses into politics without drawing in the women as well. 
 For under capitalism thefemale half of the human race is doubly oppressed. 
 The working woman and the peasant woman are oppressed by capital, but over and above that, even in the most demo-cratic of the bourgeois republics, they remain, firstly,deprived of some rights because the law does not give themequality with men; and secondly—and this is the mainthing—they remain in “household bondage”, they continue to be “household slaves”, for they are overburdened with the drudgery of the most squalid, backbreaking andstultifying toil in the kitchen and the family household. 
 No party or revolution in the world has aver dreamed of striking so deep at the roots of the oppression and inequality of women as the Soviet, Bolshevik revolution is doing. 
 Over here, in Soviet Russia, no trace is left of anyinequality between men and women under the law. 
 TheSoviet power has eliminated all there was of the especiallydisgusting, base and hypocritical inequality in the laws onmarriage and the family and inequality in respect of children. 
 This is only the first step in the liberation of woman. 
 But none of the bourgeois republics, including the mostdemocratic, has dared to take even this first step. 
 The reasonis awe of “sacrosanct private property”. 
 The second and most important step is the abolition of the private ownership of land and the factories. 
 This and this alone opens up the way towards a complete and actualemancipation of woman, her liberation from “householdbondage” through transition from petty individual housekeepingto large-scale socialised domestic services. 
 This transition is a difficult one, because it involves the remoulding of the most deep-rooted, inveterate, hide-bound and rigid “order” (indecency and barbarity wouldbe nearer the truth). 
 But the transition has been started,the thing has been set in motion, we have taken the newpath. 
 And so on this international working women’s day count-less meetings of working women in all countries of the world will send greetings to Soviet Russia, which has been thefirst to tackle this unparalleled and incredibly hard butgreat task, a task that is universally great and truly liber-atory. 
 There will be bracing calls not to lose heart in faceof the fierce and frequently savage bourgeois reaction. 
 The “freer” or “more democratic” a bourgeois country is, the wilder the rampage of its gang of capitalists against theworkers’ revolution, an example of this being the demo-cratic republic of the United States of North America. 
But the mass of workers have already awakened. 
 The dor-mant, somnolent and inert masses in America, Europe and even in backward Asia were finally roused by the imperialist war. 
 The ice has been broken in every corner of the world. 
 Nothing can stop the tide of the peoples’ liberation from the imperialist yoke and the liberation of working men and women from the yoke of capital. 
 This cause is being carried forward by tens and hundreds of millions of workingmen and women in town and countryside. 
 That is why thiscause of labour’s freedom from the yoke of capital willtriumph all over the world.

P. 
 Verbatim Report , March 8-16, 1921 ), Moscow 1 SPEECH AT THE OPENING OF THE CONGRESS MARCH 8 (Prolonged applause . 
) Comrades, allow me to declare the Tenth Congress of the Russian Communist Party open. 
 We have passed through a very eventful year both in inter-national and in our own internal history. 
 To begin withthe international situation, let me say that this is the firsttime we have met in conditions in which the CommunistInternational has ceased to be a mere slogan and has reallybeen converted into a mighty organisation with foundations —real foundations—in the major advanced capitalist coun-tries. 
 What had only been a set of resolutions at theSecond Congress of the Communist International 48 has been successfully implemented during the past year and hasfound expression, confirmation and consolidation in suchcountries as Germany, France and Italy. 
 It is enough to name these three countries to show that the Communist International, since its Second Congress in Moscow lastsummer, has become part and parcel of the working-classmovement in all the major advanced countries of Europe—more than that, it has become the chief factor in interna-tional politics. 
 This is such a great achievement, comrades, that however difficult and severe the various trials ahead of us—and we cannot and must not lose sight of them—no one can deprive us of it! Furthermore, comrades, this is the first congress that is meeting without any hostile troops, supported by thecapitalists and imperialists of the world, on the territory of the Soviet Republic. 
 The Red Army’s victories over the past year have enabled us to open a Party Congress in suchconditions for the first time. 
 Three and a half years of unparalleled struggle, and the last of the hostile armies has been driven from our territory—that is our achievement! Of course, that has not won us everything, not by a long shot; nor have we won all that we have to—real freedomfrom imperialist invasion and intervention. 
 On the contrary,their warfare against us has taken a form that is less mili-tary but is in some respects more severe and more dangerous. 
The transition from war to peace—which we hailed at the last Party Congress 49 and in the light of which we have tried to organise our work—is still far from completed. 
Our Party is still confronted with incredibly difficulttasks, not only in respect of the economic plan—wherewe have made quite a few mistakes—or the basis of eco-nomic construction, but also the basis of relations between the classes remaining in our society, in this Soviet Republic. 
 These relations have undergone a change, and this—youwill all agree—should be one of the chief questions for youto examine and decide here. 
 Comrades, we have passed through an exceptional year, we have allowed ourselves the luxury of discussions and disputes within the Party. 
 50 This was an amazing luxury for a Party shouldering unprecedented responsibilities andsurrounded by mighty and powerful enemies uniting thewhole capitalist world. 
 I do not know how you will assess that fact now. 
 Was it fully compatible with our resources, both material and spiritual? It is up to you to appraise this. 
 At all events, however, I must say that the slogan, task and aim whichwe should set ourselves at this Congress and which we mustaccomplish at all costs, is to emerge from the discussionsand disputes stronger than before. 
 ( Applause . 
) You, com-rades, cannot fail to be aware that all our enemies—and their name is legion—in all their innumerable press organs abroad repeat, elaborate and multiply the same wild rumourthat our bourgeois and petty-bourgeois enemies spread hereinside the Soviet Republic, namely: discussion means dis-putes; disputes mean discord; discord means that theCommunists have become weak; press hard, seize the oppor-tunity, take advantage of their weakening. 
 This has become the slogan of the hostile world. 
 We must not forget thisfor a moment. 
 Our task now is to show that, to whatever extent we have allowed ourselves this luxury in the past, whether rightly or wrongly, we must emerge from this situation in such a way that, having properly examined the extraordinary abundance of platforms, shades, slightshades and almost slight shades of opinion, that have beenformulated and discussed, we at our Party Congress could sayto ourselves: at all events, whatever form the discussion hastaken up to now, however much we have argued among ourselves—and we are confronted with so many enemies— the task of the dictatorship of the proletariat in a peasantcountry is so vast and difficult that formal cohesion is farfrom enough. 
 (Your presence here at the Congress is a signthat we have that much. 
) Our efforts should be more unitedand harmonious than ever before; there should not be the slightest trace of factionalism—whatever its manifestations in the past. 
 That we must not have on any account. 
 Thatis the only condition on which we shall accomplish theimmense tasks that confront us. 
 I am sure that I expressthe intention and firm resolve of all of you when I say:at all events, the end of this Congress must find our Party stronger, more harmonious, and more sincerely united than ever before. 
 ( Applause . 
) 2 REPORT ON THE POLITICAL WORK OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
) MARCH 8 Comrades, the question of the Central Committee’s politi-cal work, as you are, of course, aware, is so closely boundup with the whole work of the Party and Soviet institutions, and with the whole course of the revolution, that in my view, at any rate, there can be no question of a report inthe full sense of the word. 
 Accordingly, I take it to be mytask to try to single out some of the more important eventswhich, I think, represent the cardinal points of our workand of Soviet policy over the past year, which are most typical of what we have gone through and which provide most food for thought concerning the reasons for the coursetaken by the revolution, the significance of our mistakes—and these have been many—and the lessons for the future. 
For no matter how natural it is to report on the events ofthe past year, no matter how essential it is for the Central Committee, and no matter how interesting such a report in itself may be for the Party, the tasks of the current andforthcoming struggle are so urgent, difficult and grave,and press so hard upon us that all our attention is unwit-tingly concentrated on how to draw the appropriate conclu-sions from past experience and how best to solve present and future problems on which all our attention is focused. 
 Of all the key problems of our work in the past year, which chiefly hold our attention and with which, in myopinion, our mistakes are mainly connected, the most im-portant is the transition from war to peace. 
 All, or possiblymost of you, will recall that we have attempted this transi-tion several times during the past three and a half years, without once having completed it; and apparently we shallnot accomplish it this time either because international capitalism is too vitally interested in preventing it. 
 I recall that in April 1918, i. 
e. 
, three years ago, I had occasion to speak to the All-Russia Central Executive Committee about our tasks, which at the time were formulated as if the CivilWar had in the main come to an end, when in actual factit had only just begun. 
 You will all recall that at the pre-vious Party Congress we based all our plans on the transitionto peaceful construction, having assumed that the enormous concessions then made to Poland 51 would assure us of peace. 
 As early as April, however, the Polish bourgeoisie, which,with the imperialists of the capitalist countries, interpretedour peaceful stand as a sign of weakness, started an offensivefor which they paid dearly: they got a peace that was muchworse. 
 But we were unable to switch to peaceful construction and had once again to concentrate on the war with Poland and subsequently on wiping out Wrangel. 
 That is whatdetermined the substance of our work in the year underreview. 
 Once again all our work turned on militaryproblems. 
 Then followed the transition from war to peace when the last enemy soldier was finally driven from the territory of the R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
 This transition involved upheavals which we had certainly never foreseen. 
 That is undoubtedly one of the main causesof all our mistakes in policy during the period under review,from which we are now suffering. 
 We now realise that some of the tasks we had grossly underrated were posed by the demobilisation of the army, which had to be created in acountry that had suffered unparalleled strains and stresses,and that had gone through several years of imperialist war. 
Its demobilisation put a terrible strain on our transportfacilities, and this was intensified by the famine due to the crop failure and the fuel shortage, which largely brought the railways to a standstill. 
 That is largely the source ofthe series of crises—economic, social and political—thathit us. 
 At the end of last year I had occasion to point outthat one of the main difficulties of the coming spring wouldbe that connected with the demobilisation of the army. 
 I also pointed this out at the big discussion on December 30, which many of you may have attended. 
 I must say that atthe time we had scarcely any idea of the scale of these difficulties. 
 We had not yet seen the extent of the possible technical difficulties; but then neither had we realised the extent to which the demobilisation would intensify all the misfortunes which befell the Soviet Republic, exhaustedas it was by the old imperialist war and the new civil war. 
To some extent it would be right to say that the demobili-sation brings out these difficulties to an even greater degree. 
For a number of years, the country had been dedicated to the solution of war tasks and had given its all to solve them. 
 It had ungrudgingly sacrificed all it had, its meagre re-serves and resources, and only at the end of the war werewe able to see the full extent of that devastation and pov-erty which now condemn us to the simple healing of woundsfor a long time to come. 
 But even to this we cannot devote ourselves entirely. 
 The technical difficulties of army demo-bilisation show a good part of the depth of that devastationwhich inevitably breeds, apart from other things, a wholeseries of economic and social crises. 
 The war had habituatedus—hundreds of thousands of men, the whole country—to war-time tasks, and when a great part of the army, having solved these military tasks, finds very much worse condi-tions and incredible hardships in the countryside, withoutany opportunity—because of this and the general crisis—to apply its labour, the result is something midway betweenwar and peace. 
 We find that it is a situation in whichwe cannot very well speak of peace. 
 For it is the demobili-sation—the end of the Civil War—that makes it impos-sible for us to concentrate on peaceful construction, becauseit brings about a continuation of the war, but in a new form. 
We find ourselves involved in a new kind of war, a new formof war, which is summed up in the word “banditism”—when tens and hundreds of thousands of demobilised sol-diers, who are accustomed to the toils of war and regard it almost as their only trade, return, impoverished andruined, and are unable to find work. 
 Failure to reckon with the scale of the difficulties con-nected with the demobilisation was undoubtedly a mistakeon the part of the Central Committee. 
 It must, of course, be said that we had nothing to go on, for the Civil War was so arduous an effort that there was only one guidingprinciple: everything for victory on the Civil War front, and nothing else. 
 It was only by observing this principle, and by the Red Army’s unparalleled efforts in the struggle against Kolchak, Yudenich and others, that we could hope to, achieve victory over the imperialists who had invadedSoviet Russia. 
 From this crucial fact, which determined a whole series of mistakes and intensified the crisis, I should like to turnto the question of how a whole number of even more profound discrepancies, erroneous calculations or plans were brought to light in the work of the Party and the struggleof the entire proletariat. 
 These were not only mistakes inplanning, but in determining the balance of forces betweenour class and those classes in collaboration with which,and frequently in struggle against which, it had to decide the fate of the Republic. 
 With this as a starting-point, let us turn to the results of the past, to our politicalexperience, and to what the Central Committee, as thepolicy-making body, must understand and try to explain tothe whole Party. 
 These questions range from the course ofour war with Poland to food and fuel. 
 Our offensive, our too swift advance almost as far as Warsaw, was undoubtedly a mistake. 
 I shall not now analyse whether it was a strategicor a political error, as this would take me too far afield. 
Let us leave it to future historians, for those of us who haveto keep beating off the enemy in hard struggle have no timeto indulge in historical research. 
 At any rate, the mistake is there, and it was due to the fact that we had overestimated the superiority of our forces. 
 It would be too difficult todecide now to what extent this superiority of forcesdepended on the economic conditions, and on the fact thatthe war with Poland aroused patriotic feelings even amongthe petty-bourgeois elements, who were by no means prole-tarians or sympathisers with communism, by no means giving unconditional support to the dictatorship of the proletariat;sometimes, in fact, they did not support it at all. 
 But thefact remains that we had made a definite mistake in thewar with Poland. 
 We find a similar mistake in food. 
 With regard to surplus food appropriation and its fulfilment there can be no doubt that the year under review was more favourable than theprevious one. 
 This year the amount of grain collected is over 250 million poods. 
 By February 1, the figure was estimated at 235 million poods, as against the 210 million poods for the whole of the previous year; that is to say, more was collected in a much shorter period than for thewhole of the previous year. 
 It turned out, however, thatof these 235 millions collected by February 1, we had usedup 155 million poods within the first six months, that is,an average of 25 million or even more poods a month. 
 Of course, we must on the whole admit that we were unable to space out our reserves properly, even when they were betterthan last year’s. 
 We failed to see the full danger of thecrisis approaching with the spring, and succumbed to thenatural desire to increase the starving workers’ ration. 
Of course, it must be said that there again we had no basis for our estimates. 
 All capitalist countries, in spite of the anarchy and chaos intrinsic to capitalism, have as a basisfor their economic planning, the experience of many decadeswhich they can compare, for they have the same economicsystem differing only in details. 
 From this comparison itis possible to deduce a genuinely scientific law, a certain regularity and uniformity. 
 We cannot have and have not had anything of the kind, and it was quite natural thatwhen at the end of the war the possibility finally aroseto give the starving population a little more, we were unableall at once to establish the correct proportion. 
 We shouldhave obviously limited the increase in the ration, so as to create a certain reserve fund for a rainy day, which was due to come in the spring, and which has now arrived. 
 That wefailed to do. 
 Once again it is a mistake typical of all ourwork, a mistake which shows that the transition from war topeace confronted us with a whole number of difficultiesand problems, and we had neither the experience, the training, nor the requisite material to overcome them, and this worsened, intensified and aggravated the crisis to anextraordinary extent. 
 We undoubtedly had something similar in fuel. 
 It is crucial to economic construction. 
 The output estimates andproper distribution of fuel had, of course, to be the basis for the entire transition from war to peace—to economic construction—which was discussed at the previous PartyCongress and which has been the main concern and the focal point of all our policy during the year under review. 
 There can be no question of overcoming our difficulties or reha-bilitating our industry without it. 
 In this respect, we are clearly in a better position now than we were last year. 
We used to be cut off from the coal and oil districts, butwe got the coal and oil after the Red Army’s victories. 
 Inany case, our fuel resources have increased. 
 We know thatthe fuel resources with which we entered upon the year under review were greater than before. 
 Accordingly, we made the mistake of immediately permitting such a wide distributionof fuel that these resources were exhausted and we werefaced with a fuel crisis before we had put everything inproper working order. 
 You will hear special reports on allthese problems, and I cannot even give you any approximate figures. 
 But in any case, bearing in mind the experience of the past, we must say that this mistake was due to a wrongunderstanding of the state of affairs and the rapid pace oftransition from war to peace. 
 It turned out that the tran-sition could only be made at a much slower pace than wehad imagined. 
 The lesson driven home to us over the past year is that the preparations had to be longer, and the pace slower. 
 It is a lesson that the whole Party will need par-ticularly to learn in order to determine our main tasks forthe year ahead, if we are to avoid similar mistakes in thefuture. 
 I must add that the crop failure aggravated these mistakes and especially the resultant crises. 
 I have pointed out that the food effort during the year under review gave us verymuch better food reserves, but that too was one of the mainsources of the crises, because the crop failure had led toan acute feed shortage, a great loss of cattle and widespreadruin among the peasants, so that these grain procurements fell mainly in places where the grain surplus was not very large. 
 There are far greater surpluses in various outlyingareas of the Republic, in Siberia and in the Northern Cau-casus, but it is there that the Soviet power was less stable,the Soviet government apparatus least efficient, and trans-portation from over there was very difficult. 
 That is why it turned out that we collected the increased food reserves from the gubernias with the poorer crops and this wentto intensify the crisis in the peasant economy considerably. 
 Here again we clearly see that our estimates were not as accurate as they should have been. 
 But then we were in such a tight corner that we had no choice. 
 A country which, after a devastating imperialist war, survived such a thingas a long civil war, could not, of course, exist withoutgiving the front everything it had. 
 And, once ruined, whatcould it do but take the peasants’ surpluses, even withoutcompensating them by any other means. 
 We had to do this to save the country, the army, and the workers’ and peas-ants’ government. 
 We said to the peasants: “Of course,you are lending your grain to the workers’ and peasants’state, but unless you do, you cannot expect to save thecountry from the landowners and the capitalists. 
” We coulddo nothing else in the circumstances forced upon us by the imperialists and the capitalists through their war. 
 We had no choice. 
 But these circumstances led to such a weakeningof the peasant economy after the long war that the cropfailure was due also to the smaller sown area, worseningequipment, lower crop yields, shortage of hands, etc. 
 Thecrop failure was disastrous, but the collection of surplus grain, which was rather better than we had expected, was accompanied by an aggravation of the crisis that may bringus still greater difficulties and calamities in the monthsto come. 
 We must carefully reckon with this fact whenanalysing our political experience of the past year, andthe political tasks we set ourselves for the year ahead. 
 The year under review has left the following year with the same urgent problems. 
 I shall now deal with another point from a totally differ-ent sphere—the trade union discussion, which has takenup so much of the Party’s time. 
 I mentioned it earlier ontoday, and could naturally only venture the cautious remark that I thought many of you would consider this discussion as being too great a luxury. 
 I must add, for my part, thatI think it was quite an impermissible luxury, and we cer-tainly made a mistake when we allowed it, for we had failedto realise that we were pushing into the forefront a questionwhich for objective reasons cannot be there. 
 We allowed ourselves to indulge in this luxury, failing to realise how much attention we distracted from the vital and threaten-ing question before us, namely, this question of the crisis. 
 /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR What are the actual results of this discussion, which has been going on for so many months and which must have bored most of you? You will hear special reports on it, but I should like to draw your attention to one aspect of thematter. 
 It is that in this case the saying, “Every cloudhas a silver lining”, has been undoubtedly justified. 
 Unfortunately, there was rather a lot of cloud, and very little silver lining. 
 ( Laughter . 
) Still, the silver lining was there, for although we lost a great deal of time and diverted the attention of our Party comrades from the urgent tasksof the struggle against the petty-bourgeois elements sur-rounding us, we did learn to discern certain relationshipswhich we had not seen before. 
 The good thing was that theParty was bound to learn something from this struggle. 
 Although we all knew that, being the ruling party, we had inevitably to merge the Party and government leadership—they are merged and will remain so—the Party neverthelesslearned a certain lesson in this discussion which cannot beignored. 
 Some platforms mostly got the votes of the “top”section of the Party. 
 Some platforms which were sometimes called “the platforms of the Workers’ Opposition”, and sometimes by other names, clearly proved to be an expres-sion of a syndicalist deviation. 
 That is not just my personalopinion, but that of the vast majority of those present. 
(Voices : “That’s right. 
”) In this discussion, the Party proved itself to have matured to such an extent that, aware of a certain wavering of the “top” section and hearing the leadership say: “We cannotagree—sort us out,” it mobilised rapidly for this task andthe vast majority of the more important Party organisa-tions quickly responded: “We do have an opinion, andwe shall let you know it. 
” During the discussion we got a number of platforms. 
 There were so many of them that, although in view of myposition I should have read them all, I confess I had not. 
(Laughter . 
) I do not know whether all those present had found the time to read them, but, in any case, I must saythat this syndicalist, and to a certain degree even semi-anarchist, deviation, which has crystallised, gives food for thought. 
 For several months we allowed ourselves towallow in the luxury of studying shades of opinion. 
 Meanwhile, the demobilisation of the army was producing banditry and aggravating the economic crisis. 
 The discussion should have helped us to understand that our Party, with at least half a million members and possibly even more,has become, first, a mass party, and, second, the govern-ment party, and that as a mass party it reflects somethingof what is taking place outside its ranks. 
 It is extremelyimportant to understand this. 
 There would be nothing to fear from a slight syndical-ist or semi-anarchist deviation; the Party would haveswiftly and decisively become aware of it, and would haveset about correcting it. 
 But it is no time to argue abouttheoretical deviations when one of them is bound up withthe tremendous preponderance of peasants in the country, when their dissatisfaction with the proletarian dictator-ship is mounting, when the crisis in peasant farming iscoming to a head, and when the demobilisation of the peas-ant army is setting loose hundreds and thousands of brokenmen who have nothing to do, whose only accustomed oc-cupation is war and who breed banditry. 
 At the Congress, we must make it quite clear that we cannot have arguments about deviations and that we must put a stop to that. 
 TheParty Congress can and must do this; it must draw theappropriate lesson, and add it to the Central Committee’spolitical report, consolidate and confirm it, and make ita Party law and duty. 
 The atmosphere of the controversy is becoming extremely dangerous and constitutes a direct threat to the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
 A few months ago, when I had occasion to meet and argue with some comrades in a discussion and said, “Beware,this constitutes a threat to working-class rule and the dic-tatorship of the proletariat,” they replied, “This is intimi-dation, you are terrorising us. 
” On several occasions I have had to hear my remarks being labelled in this manner, andaccusations of intimidation thrown about, and I replied thatit would be absurd for me to try to intimidate old revolu-tionaries who had gone through all sorts of ordeals. 
 Butwhen you see the difficulties the demobilisation is producing you can no longer say it was an attempt at intimidation, or even an unavoidable exaggeration in the heat of thecontroversy; it was, in fact, an absolutely exact indication of what we now have, and of our need for unity, discipline and restraint. 
 We need all this not only because otherwise a proletarian party cannot work harmoniously, but because the spring has brought and will bring even more difficultconditions in which we cannot function without maximumunity. 
 These two main lessons, I think, we shall still beable to learn from the discussion. 
 I think it necessary tosay, therefore, that whilst we did indulge in luxury and presented the world with a remarkable example of a party, engaged in a most desperate struggle, permitting itselfthe luxury of devoting unprecedented attention to the de-tailed elucidation of separate points of platforms—all thisin face of a crop failure, a crisis, ruin and demobilisation—we shall now draw from these lessons a political conclusion —not just a conclusion pointing to some mistake, but a political conclusion—concerning the relations betweenclasses, between the working class and the peasants. 
 Theserelations are not what we had believed them to be. 
 Theydemand much greater unity and concentration of forceson the part of the proletariat, and under the dictatorship of the proletariat they are a far greater danger than all the Denikins, Kolchaks and Yudeniches put together. 
 Itwould be fatal to be deluded on this score! The difficultiesstemming from the petty-bourgeois element are enormous,and if they are to be overcome, we must have great unity,and I don’t mean just a semblance of unity. 
 We must all pull together with a single will, for in a peasant country only the will of the mass of proletarians will enable theproletariat to accomplish the great tasks of its leadershipand dictatorship. 
 Assistance is on its way from the West-European countries but it is not coming quickly enough. 
 Still it is coming and growing. 
 I pointed out this morning that one of the most important factors of the period under review, one closely related to thework of the Central Committee, is the organisation of theSecond Congress of the Comintern. 
 Of course, compared withlast year, the world revolution has made considerable head-way. 
 Of course, the Communist International, which at the time of last year’s Congress existed only in the form ofproclamations, has now begun to function as an independent party in each country, and not merely as an advanced party —communism has become central to the working-class movement as a whole. 
 In Germany, France and Italy the Communist International has become not only the centre of theworking-class movement, but also the focus of political lifein these countries. 
 Any German or French newspaper youpicked up last autumn contained abuse of Moscow and theBolsheviks, who were called all sorts of names; in fact, the Bolsheviks and the 21 conditions for admission to the Third International 52 were made the central issue of their entire political life. 
 That is an achievement no one can take awayfrom us! It shows how the world revolution is growing and howit is paralleled by the aggravation of the economic crisisin Europe. 
 But in any case, it would be madness on our part to assume that help will shortly arrive from Europe in the shape of a strong proletarian revolution, and I am sure noone here is making such an assumption. 
 In these last threeyears, we have learned to understand that placing our stakeon the world revolution does not mean relying on a definitedate, and that the accelerating pace of development may or may not lead to a revolution in the spring. 
 Therefore, we must be able to bring our work in line with the classbalance here and elsewhere, so as to be able to maintain thedictatorship of the proletariat for a long time, and, howevergradually, to remedy all our numerous misfortunes andcrises. 
 This is the only correct and sober approach. 
 I shall now turn to an item concerning the work of the Central Committee during the present year which is closelyrelated to the tasks facing us. 
 It is the question of our foreignrelations. 
 Prior to the Ninth Party Congress, our attention and all our endeavours were aimed at switching from our rela-tions of war with the capitalist countries to relations of peace and trade. 
 For that purpose we undertook all sorts of dip-lomatic moves and bested men who were undoubtedly skilleddiplomats. 
 When, for instance, the representatives ofAmerica or of the League of Nations 53 proposed that we halt hostilities against Denikin and Kolchak on certain stated terms, they thought we would land in difficulties. 
 In actual fact, it was they who landed in difficulties and we who scoreda great diplomatic victory. 
 They were made to look silly, they had to withdraw their terms, and this was subsequently exposed in all the diplomatic writings and press of the world. 
 But we cannot rest content with a diplomatic victory. 
 We need more than that: we need genuine trade relations. 
However, only this year has there been some developmentin trade relations. 
 There is the question of trade relationswith Britain, which has been central since the summerof last year. 
 In this connection, the war with Poland was a considerable setback for us. 
 Britain was ready to sign a trade agreement. 
 The British bourgeoisie wanted it, butcourt circles in Britain were against it and hampered it, andthe war with Poland delayed it. 
 It so happens that thematter has not been settled yet. 
 Today’s papers, I think, say that Krasin has told the press in London that he expects the trade agreement to be signed shortly. 
 54 I do not know whether these hopes are fully justified. 
 I cannot be certain that it will actuallytake place, but for my part I must say that we in the CentralCommittee have devoted a great deal of attention to thisquestion and considered it correct for us to compromise in order to achieve a trade agreement with Britain. 
 Not only because we could obtain more from Britain than from othercountries—she is, in this respect, not as advanced as, say,Germany or America. 
 She is a colonial power, with toogreat a stake in Asian politics, and is sometimes toosensitive to the successes of the Soviet power in certain countries lying near her colonies. 
 That is why our relations with Britain are especially tenuous. 
 This tenuousness arisesfrom such an objective tangle of causes that no amountof skill on the part of the Soviet diplomatists will help. 
But we need a trade treaty with Britain owing to thepossibility opening up for a treaty with America, whose industrial capacity is so much greater. 
 The concession issue is bound up with this. 
 We devoted far more attention to it last year than before. 
 A decreeof the Council of People’s Commissars issued on November23 set out the concession question in a form most acceptableto foreign capitalists. 
 When certain misinterpretations or insufficient understanding of this problem arose in Party circles, a number of meetings of senior Party workers wereheld to discuss it. 
 On the whole, there was not a great deal of disagreement, although we did hear of many protests from workers and peasants. 
 They said: “We got rid of our own capitalists, and now they want to call in some foreign capitalists. 
” Of course, the Central Committee had nostatistics at its disposal to decide to what extent theseprotests were due to ignorance, or expressed the hopes of thekulak or outright capitalist section of the non-Party peoplewho believe they have a legitimate right to be capitalists in Russia, and not like the foreign capitalists who are invited in without any power, but with real power. 
 Indeed, it ismost unlikely that statistics on such factors are availableanywhere in the world. 
 But this decree was, at any rate,a step towards establishing relations with a view to grant-ing concessions. 
 I must add that in practice—and this is something we must never forget—we have not secured a single concession. 
 The point at issue is whether we should try toget them at all costs. 
 Whether we get them or not does notdepend on our arguments or decisions, but on internationalcapital. 
 On February 1 of this year, the Council of People’sCommissars took another decision on the concessions. 
 Its first clause says: “To approve in principle the granting of oil concessions in Grozny and Baku and at other workingoilfields and to open negotiations which should be pressedforward. 
” There was some difference of opinion on this point. 
 Some comrades thought it was wrong to grant concessions in Grozny and Baku, as this would arouse opposition among the workers. 
 The majority on the Central Committee, includingmyself, took the view that there were possibly no groundsfor the complaints. 
 The majority on the Central Committee and I myself took the view that it was essential to grant these concessions, and we shall ask you to back it up with your authority. 
 It is vital to have such an alliance with the state trusts of theadvanced countries because our economic crisis is so deepthat we cannot, on our own, rehabilitate our ruined economywithout machinery and technical aid from abroad. 
 Gettingthe equipment out here is not enough. 
 We could grant con-cessions to the biggest imperialist trusts on a wider basis: say, a quarter of Baku, a quarter of Grozny, and a quarterof our best forest reserves, so as to assure ourselves of an essential basis by the installation of the most modern machinery; on the other hand, in return for this we shall be getting badly needed machinery for the remaining part. 
 In this way we shall be able to close a part—say, a quarteror a half—of the gap between us and the modern, advancedtrusts of other countries. 
 No one, with anything like a soberview of the present situation, will doubt that unless we dothis we shall be in a very difficult position indeed, and shall be unable to overtake them without a superhuman effort. 
 Negotiations with some of the largest world trusts havealready begun. 
 Naturally, for their part they are not simplydoing us a good turn: they are in it only for the fantasticprofits. 
 Modern capitalism—as a non-belligerent diplomatwould put it—is a robber, a ring. 
 It is not the old capital-ism of pre-war days: because of its monopoly of the world market its profit margins run to hundreds of per cents. 
 Ofcourse, this will exact a high price, but there is no otherway out because the world revolution is marking time. 
 Thereis no other way for us to raise our technology to the modernlevel. 
 And if one of the crises were to give a sharp spur to the world revolution, and if it were to arrive before the concession terms ran out, our concession obligations wouldturn out to be less onerous than they appear on paper. 
 On February 1, 1921, the Council of People’s Commissars decided to purchase 18,500,000 poods of coal abroad, forour fuel crisis was already in evidence. 
 It had already be-come clear by then that we would have to expend our gold reserves not only on the purchase of machinery. 
 In thelatter case, our coal output would have increased, for wewould have boosted our production if, instead of coal, wehad bought machines abroad to develop our coal industry,but the crisis was so acute that we had to opt for the worse economic step and spend our money on the coal we could have produced at home. 
 We shall have to make furthercompromises to buy consumer goods for the peasants andworkers. 
 I should now like to deal with the Kronstadt events. 
 55 I have not yet received the latest news from Kronstadt, but I have no doubt that this mutiny, which very quickly revealed to us the familiar figures of whiteguard generals,will be put down within the next few days, if not hours. 
 There can be no doubt about this. 
 But it is essential that we make a thorough appraisal of the political and economic lessons of this event. 
 What does it mean? It was an attempt to seize political power from the Bolsheviks by a motley crowd or alliance ofill-assorted elements, apparently just to the right of theBolsheviks, or perhaps even to their “left”—you can’treally tell, so amorphous is the combination of political groupings that has tried to take power in Kronstadt. 
 You all know, undoubtedly, that at the same time whiteguardgenerals were very active over there. 
 There is ample proof ofthis. 
 A fortnight before the Kronstadt events. 
, the Parisnewspapers reported a mutiny at Kronstadt. 
 It is quite clearthat it is the work of Socialist-Revolutionaries and white-guard émigrés, and at the same time the movement was reduced to a petty-bourgeois counter-revolution and petty-bourgeois anarchism. 
 That is something quite new. 
 Thiscircumstance, in the context of all the crises, must be givencareful political consideration and must be very thoroughlyanalysed. 
 There is evidence here of the activity of petty-bourgeois anarchist elements with their slogans of unrestrict-ed trade and invariable hostility to the dictatorship of theproletariat. 
 This mood has had a wide influence on theproletariat. 
 It has had an effect on factories in Moscowand a number of provincial centres. 
 This petty-bourgeoiscounter-revolution is undoubtedly more dangerous than Denikin, Yudenich and Kolchak put together, because ours is a country where the proletariat is in a minority, wherepeasant property has gone to ruin and where, in addition,the demobilisation has set loose vast numbers of potentiallymutinous elements. 
 No matter how big or small the initial,shall I say, shift in power, which the Kronstadt sailors and workers put forward—they wanted to correct the Bol-sheviks in regard to restrictions in trade—and this lookslike a small shift, which leaves the same slogans of “Sovietpower” with ever so slight a change or correction. 
 Yet,in actual fact the whiteguards only used the non-Partyelements as a stepping stone to get in. 
 This is politically inevitable. 
 We saw the petty-bourgeois, anarchist elements in the Russian revolution, and we have been fighting themfor decades. 
 We have seen them in action since February 1917, during the great revolution, and their parties’ at-tempts to prove that their programme differed little from that of the Bolsheviks, but that only their methods in carrying it through were different. 
 We know this not only from theexperience of the October Revolution, but also of the out-lying regions and various areas within the former RussianEmpire where the Soviet power was temporarily replacedby other regimes. 
 Let us recall the Democratic Committee in Samara. 
 56 They all came in demanding equality, freedom, and a constituent assembly, and every time they provedto be nothing but a conduit for whiteguard rule. 
 Becausethe Soviet power is being shaken by the economic situation,we must consider all this experience and draw the theo-retical conclusions a Marxist cannot escape. 
 The experience of the whole of Europe shows the practical results of trying to sit between two stools. 
 That is why in this context wemust say that political friction, in this case, is a greatdanger. 
 We must take a hard look at this petty-bourgeoiscounter-revolution with its calls for freedom to trade. 
Unrestricted trade—even if it is not as bound up initially with the whiteguards as Kronstadt was—is still only the thin end of the wedge for the whiteguard element, a victory forcapital and its complete restoration. 
 We must, I repeat,have a keen sense of this political danger. 
 It shows what I said in dealing with our platforms discussion: in face of this danger we must understand that we must do more than put an end to Party disputes as a matter of form—we shall do that, of course. 
 We need toremember that we must take a much more serious approachto this question. 
 We have to understand that, with the peasant economy in the grip of a crisis, we can survive only by appealing to the peasants to help town and countryside. 
 We must bear in mind that the bourgeoisie is trying to pit the peasantsagainst the workers; that behind a façade of workers’ slogansit is trying to incite the petty-bourgeois anarchist elementsagainst the workers. 
 This, if successful, will lead directlyto the overthrow of the dictatorship of the proletariat and, consequently, to the restoration of capitalism and of the old landowner and capitalist regime. 
 The political dangerhere is obvious. 
 A number of revolutions have clearly gone that way; we have always been mindful of this possibility and have warned against it. 
 This undoubtedly demands of the ruling party of Communists, and of the leading revo-lutionary elements of the proletariat a different attitudeto the one we have time and again displayed over the pastyear. 
 It is a danger that undoubtedly calls for much greaterunity and discipline; it undoubtedly requires that we shouldall pull harder together. 
 Otherwise we shall not cope with the dangers that have fallen to our lot. 
 Then there are the economic problems. 
 What is the mean-ing of the unrestricted trade demanded by the petty-bourgeoiselements? It is that in the proletariat’s relations with thesmall farmers there are difficult problems and tasks wehave yet to solve. 
 I am-speaking of the victorious proletar-iat’s relations with the small proprietors when the prole-tarian revolution unfolds in a country where the proletariatis in a minority, and the petty bourgeoisie, in a majority. 
In such a country the proletariat’s role is to direct thetransition of these small proprietors to socialised and col-lective work. 
 Theoretically this is beyond dispute. 
 We have dealt with this transition in a number of legislative acts, but we know that it does not turn on legislative acts, buton practical implementation, which, we also know, canbe guaranteed when you have a very powerful, large-scaleindustry capable of providing the petty producer with suchbenefits that he will see its advantages in practice. 
 That is how Marxists and all socialists who have given thought to the social revolution and its tasks have alwaysregarded the question in theory. 
 But Russia’s most pro-nounced characteristic of which I have spoken is that we have,on the one hand, not only a minority, but a considerableminority of proletarians, and, on the other, a vast majority of peasants. 
 And the conditions in which we have had to defend the revolution made the solution of our problemsincredibly difficult. 
 We have not been able to show allthe advantages of large-scale production, for it lies in ruins,and is dragging out a miserable existence. 
 It can only berehabilitated by demanding sacrifices from these very same small farmers. 
 To get industry on its feet you need fuel; if you need fuel, you must rely on firewood; and ifyou rely on firewood, you must look to the peasant and his horse. 
 In conditions of crisis, the fodder shortage and the loss of cattle, the peasant must give his produce on credit to the Soviet power for the sake of a large-scale industry which has not yet given him a thing. 
 That is theeconomic situation which gives rise to enormous difficultiesand demands a deeper analysis of the conditions of transi-tion from war to peace. 
 We cannot run a war-time economyotherwise than by telling the peasants: “You must make loans to the workers’ and peasants’ state to help it pull through. 
” When concentrating on economic rehabilitation,we must understand that we have before us a small farmer,a small proprietor and producer who will work for the marketuntil the rehabilitation and triumph of large-scale produc-tion. 
 But rehabilitation on the old basis is impossible; it will take years, at least a decade, and possibly longer, in view of the havoc. 
 Until then we shall have to deal, formany long years, with the small producer as such, and theunrestricted trade slogan will be inevitable. 
 It is dangerous,not because it covers up the aspirations of the whiteguardsand Mensheviks, but because it may become widespread in spite of the peasants’ hatred for the whiteguards. 
 It is apt to spread because it conforms to the economic conditionsof the small producer’s existence. 
 It is out of such consid-erations that the Central Committee adopted its decisionto start a discussion on the substitution of a tax forsurplus food appropriation and today placed this question squarely before the Congress, a motion which today’s reso-lution approves. 
 57 The tax and appropriation problem had been brought up in our legislation a long time ago,back in late 1918. 
 The tax law was dated October 30, 1918. 
The law on a tax in kind on the farmer was enacted, butnever became operative. 
 A number of instructions were issued in the few months after its promulgation, but it was never applied. 
 On the other hand, the confiscationof surpluses from the peasants was a measure with whichwe were saddled by the imperative conditions of war-time,but which no longer applies to anything like the peace-time conditions of the peasant’s economy. 
 He needs the assurance that, while he has to give away a certain amount, he will have so much left to sell locally. 
 The whole of our economy and its various branches were affected throughout by war-time conditions. 
 With this in mind, our task was to collect a definite quantity of food, regardless of what it did to the national turnover. 
 As we turn from problems of war to those of peace, we take adifferent view of the tax in kind: we see it not only from thestandpoint of meeting the needs of the state, but alsothose of the small farms. 
 We must try to understand theeconomic forms of the petty farmer’s indignation against the proletariat which has been in evidence and which is being aggravated in the current crisis. 
 We must try to doour utmost in this respect for it is a matter of vital impor-tance. 
 We must allow the peasant to have a certain amountof leeway in local trade, and supplant the surplus foodappropriation by a tax, to give the small farmer a chance to plan his production and determine its scale in accordance with the tax. 
 We know quite well, of course, that in ourconditions this is a very difficult thing to do. 
 The sownarea, the crop yield, and the farm implements have allbeen reduced, the surpluses have undoubtedly decreased,and in very many cases have disappeared altogether. 
 These circumstances must be regarded as a fact. 
 The peasant will have to go hungry for a while in order to save the townsand factories from famine. 
 That is something quite under-standable on a country-wide scale, but we do not expect thepoverty-stricken lone-wolf farmer to understand it. 
 Andwe know that we shall not be able to do without coercion, on which the impoverished peasants are very touchy. 
 Nor must we imagine that this measure will rid us of the crisis. 
 Butwe do regard it as our task to make the maximum conces-sions, to give the small producer the best conditions to comeinto his own. 
 Up to now, we have been adapting ourselvesto the tasks of war; we must now adapt ourselves to the conditions of peace. 
 The Central Committee is faced with this task—the task of switching to the tax in kind in con-ditions of proletarian power, and it is closely bound upwith the question of concessions. 
 You will be having aspecial discussion on this problem, and it requires yourspecial consideration. 
 By granting concessions, the prole-tarian power can secure an agreement with advanced capi-talist states. 
 On it depends our industrial growth, withoutwhich we cannot hope to advance towards communism. 
 On the other hand, in this period of transition in a country where the peasants predominate, we must manage to go over to measures giving economic security to the peasants, and do the most we can to ease their economic condition. 
 Untilwe have remoulded the peasant, until large-scale machineryhas recast him, we must assure him of the possibility ofrunning his economy without restrictions. 
 We are now ina transitional phase, and our revolution is surrounded by capitalist countries. 
 As long as we are in this phase, we are forced to seek highly complex forms of relationships. 
Oppressed by war, we were unable to concentrate on how toestablish economic relations between the proletarian statepower, with an incredibly devastated large-scale industry,and the small farmers, and how to find forms of coexistence with them, who, as long as they remain small farmers, cannot exist without their small economy having somesystem of exchange. 
 I believe this to be the Soviet Govern-ment’s most important question in the sphere of economicsand politics at the present time. 
 I believe that it sums upthe political results of our work, now that the war period has ended and we have begun, in the year under review, to make the transition to peace. 
 This transition is bound up with such difficulties and has so clearly delineated this petty-bourgeois element, thatwe must take a sober view of it. 
 We view this series of eventsin terms of the class struggle, and we have never doubted that the relations between the proletariat and the petty bourgeoisie are a difficult problem, demanding complexmeasures or, to be more accurate, a whole system of complex,transitional measures, to ensure the victory of the prole-tarian power. 
 The fact that we issued our tax in kind decreeat the end of 1918 proves that the Communists were aware of this problem, but were unable to solve it because of the war. 
 With the Civil War on, we had to adopt war-timemeasures. 
 But it would be a very great mistake indeed ifwe drew the conclusion that these are the only measuresand relations possible. 
 That would surely lead to the col-lapse of the Soviet power and the dictatorship of the prole-tariat. 
 When the transition to peace takes place in a period of economic crisis, it should be borne in mind that it iseasier to build up a proletarian state in a country with large-scale production than in one with a predominantly small-scale production. 
 This problem has to be approached in a whole number of ways, and we do not close our eyes to these difficulties, or forget that the proletariat is one thing, andthe small-scale producer, another. 
 We have not forgottenthat there are different classes, that petty-bourgeois, anarch-ist counter-revolution is a political step to whiteguard rule. 
We must face this squarely, with an awareness that this needs, on the one hand, maximum unity, restraint and discipline within the proletarian party, and on the other,a series of economic measures which we have not been ableto carry out so far because of the war. 
 We must recognisethe need to grant concessions, and purchase machinery andequipment to satisfy agriculture, so as to exchange them for grain and re-establish relations between the proletariat and the peasants which will enable it to exist in peace-time conditions. 
 I trust that we shall return to this prob-lem, and I repeat that, in my view, we are dealing herewith an important matter, and that the past year, whichmust be characterised as a period of transition from war to peace, confronts us with some extremely difficult problems. 
 Let me say a few words in conclusion about combating bureaucratic practices, the question which has taken upso much of our time. 
 It came up before the Central Commit-tee last summer; in August the Central Committee senta circular to all organisations, and the matter was put before a Party conference in September. 
 Finally, at the December Congress of Soviets, it was dealt with on a widerscale. 
 58 We do have a bureaucratic ulcer; it has been diagnosed and has to be treated in earnest. 
 Of course, in thediscussion that we have had some platforms dealt with theproblem quite frivolously, to say the least, and, by and large, from a petty-bourgeois viewpoint. 
 There is no doubt that some discontent and stirrings have recently been inevidence among non-Party workers. 
 Non-Party meetingsin Moscow have clearly turned “democracy” and “freedom”into slogans leading up to the overthrow of the Soviet power. 
Many, or, at any rate, some representatives of the Workers’ Opposition have battled against this petty-bourgeois, counter-revolutionary evil, and have said: “We shall unite againstthis. 
” And in actual fact they have been able to display the maximum unity. 
 I cannot tell whether all the support-ers of the Workers’ Opposition group and other groups with semi-syndicalist platforms are like them. 
 We need to learn more about this at the Congress, we need to under-stand that the struggle against the evils of bureaucracy isabsolutely indispensable, and that it is just as intricateas the fight against the petty-bourgeois element. 
 Thebureaucratic practices of our state system have become such a serious malaise that they are dealt with in our Party Programme, because they are connected with this petty-bourgeois element, which is widely dispersed. 
 This malaisecan only be cured by the working people’s unity and theirability not only to welcome the decrees of the Workers’and Peasants’ Inspection (have you seen many decrees that have not been welcomed?) but to exercise their right through the Inspection, something you don’t find eitherin the villages, the towns, or even the capital cities. 
 Thosewho shout loudest against the evils of bureaucracy veryfrequently do not know how to exercise this right. 
 Verygreat attention needs to be paid to this fact. 
 In this area, we often see those who battle against this evil, possibly with a sincere desire to help the proletarianparty, the proletarian dictatorship and the proletarianmovement, actually helping the petty-bourgeois, anarchistelement, which on more than one occasion during therevolution has shown itself to be the most dangerous enemy of the proletarian dictatorship. 
 And now—and this is the main conclusion and lesson of the past year—it has onceagain shown itself to be the most dangerous enemy, whichis most likely to have followers and supporters in a countrylike ours, to change the mood of the broad masses and toaffect even a section of the non-Party workers. 
 That is when the proletarian state finds itself in a very difficult position. 
 Unless we understand this, learn our lesson, and make thisCongress a turning-point both in economic policy and inthe sense of maximum unity of the proletariat, we shallhave to apply to ourselves the unfortunate saying: we haveforgotten nothing of what—small and trifling at times— deserves to be forgotten, and have learned nothing of the serious things this year of the revolution should havetaught us. 
 I hope that will not be the case! ( Stormy applause . 
) 3 SUMMING -UP SPEECH ON THE REPORT OF THE C. 
C. 
 OF THE R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
) MARCH 9 (Prolonged applause . 
) Comrades, one would have ex-pected the criticism, remarks, additions and amendments,etc. 
, elicited by the report on the political activity of theCentral Committee to concentrate on political work and political mistakes, and to give political advice. 
 Unfortunately, when you take a closer look at the debate and go over the main points made in it, you cannot helpasking yourself: Was it not because the speeches were sostrangely vapid, and almost all the speakers werefrom the Workers’ Opposition, that the Congress folded up its debate so quickly? Indeed, just what has been said of the Central Committee’s political work and currentpolitical tasks? Most of the speakers said they belonged tothe Workers’ Opposition. 
 This is no trifling title. 
 And it isno trifling matter to form an opposition in such a Party andat such a moment! Comrade Kollontai, for example, said bluntly: “Lenin’s report evaded Kronstadt. 
” When I heard that I didn’t knowwhat to say. 
 Everyone present at this Congress knows per-fectly well—newspaper reports will naturally not be as explicitas the speeches here are—that my report tied in everything—from beginning to end—with the lessons of Kronstadt. 
 If anything, I deserve to be reproached for devoting the greater part of my report to the lessons that flow from theKronstadt events, and the smaller part to past mistakes,political facts and crucial points in our work, which, inmy opinion, determine our political tasks and help us toavoid such mistakes in the future. 
 What did we hear of the lessons of Kronstadt? When people come forward in the name of an opposition, which they call a “workers’” opposition, and say that the Central Committee has failed to steer the Party’s policy properly, we must tell them that we need pointers indicating what was wrong on the main questions, and ways of recti-fying it. 
 Unfortunately, we heard absolutely nothing, nota word or sound, about the present situation and its les-sons. 
 No one even touched upon the conclusion that I drew. 
It may be wrong, but the whole point of making reports atcongresses is precisely to rectify what is wrong. 
 The political conclusion to be drawn from the present situation is that the Party must be united and any opposition prevented. 
The economic conclusion is that we must not rest contentwith what has been achieved in the policy of reaching anagreement between the working class and the peasantry;we must seek new ways and put them to the test. 
 I was quite specific about what we needed to do. 
 Perhaps I was wrong, but nobody said a word about that. 
 One of the speakers, Ithink it was Ryazanov, reproached me only for havingsuddenly sprung the tax on the Congress, before the groundhad been prepared for it by discussion. 
 That is not true. 
The surprising thing is that responsible comrades can make such statements at a Party Congress. 
 The tax discussion was started in Pravda a few weeks ago. 
 If the comrades who arefond of the game of opposition and like to complain that weare not providing an opportunity for broad discussion did notchoose to take part in it, they have no one to blame butthemselves. 
 We are connected with Pravda ’s editorial board not only through Comrade Bukharin’s being a member of the Central Committee, but also through the Central Com-mittee discussions of all the most important subjects andlines of policy. 
 Otherwise there can be no political work. 
The Central Committee submitted the tax question fordiscussion. 
 Articles were published in Pravda . 
 Nobody replied to them. 
 Those who refrained from replying showed that they did not wish to go into the matter. 
 When, at ameeting of the Moscow Soviet—after these articles had beenpublished—somebody, I do not remember whether it wasa non-Party man or a Menshevik, got up and began to talkabout the tax, I said: You don’t seem to know what’s being said in Pravda. 
 It was more natural to say that sort of thing to a non-Party man than to a member of the Party. 
 It wasno accident that the discussion was started in Pravda ; and we shall have to deal with it here. 
 The criticism has been altogether unbusiness-like. 
 The question was put up for discussion, and the critics should have taken part in it; because they had failed to do so, their criticism is ground-less. 
 The same may be said of the political question. 
 Irepeat: all my attention was concentrated on drawing thecorrect conclusion from recent events. 
 We are passing through a period of grave danger: as I have said the petty-bourgeois counter-revolution is a greater danger than Denikin. 
 The comrades did not deny this. 
 Thepeculiar feature of this counter-revolution is that it is petty-bourgeois and anarchistic. 
 I insist that there is a connectionbetween its ideas and slogans and those of the Workers’Opposition. 
 There was no response to this from any of the speakers, although most of them belonged to the Workers’ Opposition. 
 And yet, the Workers’ Opposition pamphlet,which Comrade Kollontai published for the Congress, servesto confirm my assertion better than anything else. 
 And Isuppose I shall have to deal chiefly with this pamphlet toexplain why the counter-revolution, to which I have referred, is assuming an anarchist, petty-bourgeois form, why it is so vast and dangerous, and why the speakers from theWorkers’ Opposition have failed entirely to realise thedanger. 
 But before replying to them I want to say a word or two, before I forget, on another subject, namely Osinsky. 
 This comrade, who has written a great deal and has brought out his own platform, gets up and criticises the CentralCommittee’s report. 
 We could have expected him to criti-cise our principal measures, and this would have been veryvaluable for us. 
 Instead, he said that we had “thrown out”Sapronov, which showed that our calls for unity were at variance with our deeds; and he made a point of stressing that two members of the Workers’ Opposition had beenelected to the Presidium. 
 I am surprised that an extremelyprominent Party worker and writer, who occupies a respon-sible post, can talk about such trifles, which are of tenth-rate importance! Osinsky has the knack of seeing political trickery in everything. 
 He sees it also in the fact that two seats on the Presidium were given to the Workers’Opposition. 
 At a Party meeting in Moscow I called attention to the rise of the Workers’ Opposition, and I regret that I must do so again now, at the Party Congress. 
 It had revealed itself in October and November by bringing in the two-roomsystem, and the formation of factions. 
 We have repeatedly said, and I have, in particular, that our task is to separate the wheat from the chaff in the Work-ers’ Opposition, because it has spread to some extent, and has damaged our work in Moscow. 
 There was no difference of opinion in the Central Committee on that score. 
 Therewas evidence of damage to our work, the start of fac-tionalism and a split in November, during the two-roomconference 59—when some met here and others down at the other end of the floor, and when I had my share of the trouble, for I had to act as errand-boy and shuttle between the rooms. 
 Back in September, during the Party Conference,60 w e regarded it as our task to separate the wheat from the chafffor the group could not be regarded as consisting entirelyof good stuff. 
 When we hear complaints about inadequate democracy, we say: it is absolutely true. 
 Indeed, it is not being practised sufficiently. 
 We need assistance and advicein this matter. 
 We need real democracy, and not just talk. 
We even accept those who call themselves the Workers’Opposition, or something worse, although I think that formembers of the Communist Party no name can be worse or more disreputable. 
 But even if they had adopted a much worse title, we say to ourselves: since this is a malaise thathas affected a section of the workers we must pay the closestattention to it. 
 And we should be given credit for the verything that Comrade Osinsky has accused us of, though whyhe should have done so, I don’t know. 
 I now come to the Workers’ Opposition. 
 You have admitted that you are in opposition. 
 You have come to the PartyCongress with Comrade Kollontai’s pamphlet which is en-titled The Workers ’ Opposition . 
 When you sent in the final proofs, you knew about the Kronstadt events and the risingpetty-bourgeois counter-revolution. 
 And it is at a time like this that you come here, calling yourselves a Workers’ Opposition. 
 You don’t seem to realise the responsibilityyou are undertaking, and the way you are disrupting our unity! What is your object? We will question you and put you through a test right here. 
 Comrade Osinsky used this expression in a polemical sense; he seemed to think that we were guilty of somemistake or misdemeanour. 
 Like Ryazanov, he saw politicaltrickery in our policy towards the Workers’ Opposition. 
It is not political trickery; it is the policy the CentralCommittee has been pursuing, and will continue to pursue. 
 Since unhealthy trends and groups have arisen, let us more than redouble our attention to them. 
 If there is anything at all sound in that opposition, we must make every effort to sift it from the rest. 
 We cannotcombat the evils of bureaucracy effectively, or practisedemocracy consistently because we lack the strength and are weak. 
 We must enlist those who can help us in this matter, and expose and sift out those who produce suchpamphlets on the pretext of helping us. 
 This task of sifting is being facilitated at the Party Con-gress. 
 Representatives of the ailing group have been electedto the Presidium and these “poor”, “wronged”, and “ban-ished” people will no longer dare to complain and wail. 
 There’s the rostrum, up on it, and let’s have your answer!You have spoken more than anyone else. 
 Now let us see whatyou have in store for us, with this looming danger, which,you admit, is a greater one than Denikin! What have youcome up with? What is the nature of your criticism? We must have this test now, and I think it will be the final one. 
 We have had enough of that sort of thing! The Partywill not be trifled with in this way! Whoever comes to theCongress with such a pamphlet is trifling with the Party. 
You can’t play that kind of game when hundreds of thou-sands of demoralised veterans are playing havoc with our economy—the Party will not stand for such treatment. 
 You can’t behave that way. 
 You must realise that, andput a stop to it! After these preliminary remarks about the election to the Presidium and the character of the Workers’ OppositionI want to draw your attention to Comrade Kollontai’s pamphlet. 
 It really deserves your attention, for it sums up the activity this opposition has been carrying on forseveral months, or the disintegration it has caused. 
 It was said here, by a comrade from Samara, I think, that I had stuck the label of syndicalism on the Workers’ Opposition, in an “administrative” fashion. 
 The reference is altogether misplaced, and we must investigate which of the questionscalls for an administrative solution. 
 Comrade Milonov triedto score with a terrifying catchword, but it fell flat. 
 Hesaid that I stuck on a label in “administrative” fashion. 
I have said before that at our meetings Comrade Shlyap-nikov and others have accused me of “intimidating” people with the word “syndicalism”. 
 When this was mentionedat one of our discussions, at the Miners’ Congress, I think,I replied to Comrade Shlyapnikov: “Do you hope to takein any grown-ups?” After all, Comrade Shlyapnikov andI have known each other for many, many years, ever since the period of our underground work and emigration—how can he say that I am trying to intimidate anyone by charac-terising certain deviations? And when I say that the standof the Workers’ Opposition is wrong, and that it is syndi-calism—what has administrating got to do with it?! Andwhy does Comrade Kollontai write that I have been bandy-ing the word “syndicalism” about in frivolous fashion? She ought to produce some proof before saying anythinglike that. 
 I am prepared to allow that my proof is wrong,and that Comrade Kollontai’s statement is weightier—Iam prepared to believe that. 
 But we must have some littleproof—not in the form of words about intimidating or administrating (which, unfortunately, my official duties compel me to engage in a great deal), but in the form ofa definite reply, refuting my accusation that the Workers’Opposition is a deviation towards syndicalism. 
 I made it before the whole Party, with a full sense of responsibility, and it was printed in a pamphlet in 250,000 copies, and everyone has read it. 
 Evidently, all the com-rades have prepared for this Congress, and they should knowthat the syndicalist deviation is an anarchist deviation,and that the Workers’ Opposition, which is hiding behindthe backs of the proletariat, is a petty-bourgeois, anarchistelement. 
 That it has been penetrating into the broad masses is evident, and the Party Congress has thrown light on thisfact. 
 That this element has become active is proved by Comrade Kollontai’s pamphlet and Comrade Shlyapnikov’s theses. 
 And this time you can’t get away with talk about being a true proletarian, as Comrade Shlyapnikov is in the habit of doing. 
 Comrade Kollontai starts her pamphlet with the follow-ing: “The opposition,” we read on page one, “consists ofthe advanced section of the class-organised proletarians,who are Communists. 
” A delegate from Siberia told the Miners’ Congress 61 that over there they had discussed the same questions as were being discussed in Moscow, andComrade Kollontai mentions this in her pamphlet: “‘We had no idea that there were disagreements and discussions in Moscow about the role of the trade unions,’ a delegate from Siberia told the Miners’ Congress, ‘but we were set astir by the same questions that you are faced with over here. 
’” Further: “The Workers’ Opposition has the backing of the proletarian masses, or, to be more precise: it is the class-welded, class-consciousand class-consistent section of our industrial proletariat. 
” Well, thank heaven, we now know that Comrade Kollon-tai and Comrade Shlyapnikov are “class-welded” and “class-conscious”. 
 But, comrades, when you say and write suchthings you must have some sense of proportion! ComradeKollontai writes on page 25, and this is one of the main points of the Workers’ Opposition theses, the following: “The organisation of the management of the national economy is the function of an All-Russia Congress of Producers organised intrade and industrial unions, which shall elect a central body to runthe whole of the national economy of the Republic. 
” That is the very thesis of the Workers’ Opposition that I have quoted in every case in the discussion and in thepress. 
 I must say that after reading it I did not troubleto read the rest, as that would have been a waste of time;for that thesis made it quite clear that these people hadreached the limit, and that theirs is a petty-bourgeois, anarchist element. 
 Now, in the light of the Kronstadt events, that thesis sounds queerer than ever. 
 At the Second Congress of the Comintern last summer, I pointed to the significance of the resolution on the role of the Communist Party. 
 It is a resolution uniting the Com-munist workers and the Communist Parties of the world. 
 It explains everything. 
 Does that mean that we are fencingoff the Party from the whole of the working class, which isdefinitely exercising a dictatorship? That is what certain“Leftists” and very many syndicalists think, and the ideais now widespread. 
 It is the product of petty-bourgeois ideology. 
 The theses of the Workers’ Opposition fly in the face of the decision of the Second Congress of the Cominternon the Communist Party’s role in operating the dictator-ship of the proletariat. 
 It is syndicalism because—considerthis carefully—our proletariat has been largely declassed;the terrible crises and the closing down of the factories have compelled people to flee from starvation. 
 The workers have simply abandoned their factories; they have had to settledown in the country and have ceased to be workers. 
 Arewe not aware of the fact that the unprecedented crises,the Civil War, the disruption of proper relations betweentown and country and the cessation of grain deliveries have given rise to a trade in small articles made at the big fac-tories—such as cigarette lighters—which are exchanged forcereals, because the workers are starving, and no grain isbeing delivered? Have we not seen this happen in theUkraine, or in Russia? That is the economic source of theproletariat’s declassing and the inevitable rise of petty-bourgeois, anarchist trends. 
 The experience of all our hardships tells us how desper-ately hard it is to combat them. 
 After two and a half yearsof the Soviet power we came out in the Communist Inter-national and told the world that the dictatorship of theproletariat would not work except through the Communist Party. 
 At the time, the anarchists and syndicalists furi-ously attacked us and said: “You see, this is what they think—a Communist Party is needed to operate the proletariandictatorship. 
 62 But we said this before the whole Com-munist International. 
 After all this, you have these “class-conscious and class-welded” people coming and telling us that “the organisation of the management of the national economy is the function of an All-Russia Congress of Pro-ducers” (Comrade Kollontai’s pamphlet). 
 What is this “All-Russia Congress of Producers”? Are we going to waste more time on that sort of opposition in the Party? I think we have had enough of this discussion! All the arguments about freedom of speech and freedom to criticise, of which thepamphlet is full and which run through all the speechesof the Workers’ Opposition, constitute nine-tenths of themeaning of these speeches, which have no particular mean-ing at all. 
 They are all words of the same order. 
 After all, comrades, we ought to discuss not only words, but also their meaning. 
 You can’t fool us with words like “freedomto criticise”. 
 When we were told that there were symptomsof a malaise in the Party, we said that this deserved ourredoubled attention: the malaise is undoubtedly there, letus help to cure it; but tell us how you intend to go about it. 
 We have spent quite a lot of time in discussion, and I must say that the point is now being driven farther home with“rifles” than with the opposition’s theses. 
 Comrades, thisis no time to have an opposition. 
 Either you’re on thisside, or on the other, but then your weapon must be a gun,and not an opposition. 
 This follows from the objective situation, and you mustn’t blame us for it. 
 Comrades, let’s not have an opposition just now! I think the Party Congresswill have to draw the conclusion that the opposition’s timehas run out and that the lid’s on it. 
 We want no moreoppositions! ( Applause . 
) This group has long been free to criticise. 
 And now, at this Party Congress, we ask: What are the results and the content of your criticism? What have you taught the Partyby your criticism? We are prepared to enlist the servicesof those of you who stand closest to the masses, the reallyclass-welded and class-mature masses. 
 If Comrade Osinskyregards this as political trickery he will be isolated, for the rest will regard it as a real help to Party members. 
 We must really help those who live with the workers’ masses,who have intimate knowledge of them, who have expe-rience and can advise the Central Committee. 
 Let them callthemselves what they like—it makes no difference—as longas they help in the work, as long as they help us, instead of playing at opposition and insisting on having groups and factions at all costs. 
 But if they continue this gameof opposition, the Party will have to expel them. 
 And when on this very same page of her pamphlet Comrade Kollontai writes in bold type about “lack of confidence in the working class”, the idea is that they are a real “workers’” opposition. 
 There is an even more strikingexpression of this idea on page 36: “The Workers’ Opposition cannot, and must not, make any concessions. 
 This does not mean calling for a split.... 
 No, its aim isdifferent. 
 Even in the event of defeat at the Congress, it must remainwithin the Party and firmly defend its point of view, step by step,saving the Party and straightening out its line. 
” “Even in the event of defeat at the Congress”—my word, what foresight! ( Laughter . 
) You will pardon me if I take he liberty of saying, on my own behalf, that I am sure thatis something the Party Congress will certainly not permit! (Applause . 
) Everyone has the right to straighten out the Party’s line, and you have had every opportunity of doingso. 
 The condition has been laid down at the Party Congress that there must not be the slightest suspicion that we wantto expel anybody. 
 We welcome every assistance in getting democracy working, but when the people are exhausted it will take more than talk to do it. 
 Everyone who wants tohelp is to be welcomed; but when they say that they will“make no concessions” and will make efforts to save theParty, while remaining in it, we say: yes, if you are allowedto stay! ( Applause . 
) In this case, we have no right to leave any room for ambiguity. 
 We certainly need help in combating bureaucracy,safeguarding democracy, and extending contacts with thetruly working-class masses. 
 We can and must make “con-cessions” in this respect. 
 And though they keep sayingthat they will not make any concessions, we shall repeat: We will. 
 That’s not making concessions but helping the workers’ Party. 
 In this way, we shall win over all the soundand proletarian elements in the Workers’ Opposition to theside of the Party, leaving outside the “class-conscious”authors of syndicalist speeches. 
 ( Applause . 
) This has been done in Moscow. 
 The Moscow Gubernia Conference last November ended up in two rooms: some met in one, others, in another. 
 That was the eve of a split. 
 The last MoscowConference said, “We will take from the Workers’ Opposition those we want, and not those they want”, because we need the assistance of men who are connected with the masses of workers and who can teach us how to combat the evils of bureaucracy in practice. 
 This is a difficult task. 
I think the Party Congress should take note of the Musco-vites’ experience and stage a test, not only on this point,but on all the points of the agenda. 
 As a result, the peoplewho declare that they “will make no concessions” must be told: “But the Party will. 
” We must all pull together. 
 By means of this policy we shall sift the sound elementsfrom the unsound in the Workers’ Opposition, and the Partywill be strengthened. 
 Just think: it was said here that production should be run by an “All-Russia Congress of Producers”. 
 I find myself groping for words to describe this nonsense, but am reas-sured by the fact that all the Party workers present here arealso Soviet functionaries who have been doing their workfor the revolution for one, two or three years. 
 It is notworth criticising that sort of thing in their presence. 
 Whenthey hear such tedious speeches they close the discussion, because it is frivolous to speak of an “All-Russia Congress of Producers” running the national economy. 
 A proposalof that kind could be made in a country where thepolitical power has been taken but no start has been madeon the work. 
 We have made a start. 
 And it is a curious factthat on page 33 of this pamphlet we find the following: “The Workers’ Opposition is not so ignorant as to disregard the great role of technique and of technically trained forces.... 
 It has nointention to set up its organs of administration of the national economyelected by the Producers’ Congress and then to dissolve the economiccouncils, chief administrations and central boards. 
 No, the idea isquite different: it is to subordinate these necessary, technically valua-ble centres of administration to its guidance, assign theoretical tasks to them and use them in the same way as the factory owners once usedthe services of technical experts. 
” In other words, Comrade Kollontai and Comrade Shlyap-nikov, and their “class-welded” followers, are to subor-dinate to their necessary guidance the economic councils, chief administrations and central boards—all the Rykovs, Nogins and other “nonentities”—and assign to them theo-retical tasks! Comrades, are we to take that seriously? If you have had any “theoretical tasks”, why had you not assigned them before? Why did we proclaim freedom of discussion? It was not merely to engage in verbal exchanges. 
 During the war we used to say: “This is not the time forcriticism: Wrangel is out there. 
 We correct our mistakesby beating Wrangel. 
” After the war, we hear shouts of “Wewant freedom of discussion!” When we ask, “Tell us ourmistakes!”, we are told, “The economic councils and chief administrations must not be dissolved; they must be assigned theoretical tasks. 
” Comrade Kiselyov, as arepresentative of the “class-welded” Workers’ Opposi-tion, was left in an insignificant minority at theMiners’ Congress, but, when he was head of the ChiefAdministration of the Textile Industry, why did he not teach us how to combat the evils of bureaucracy? Why did not Comrade Shlyapnikov, when he was a People’sCommissar, and Comrade Kollontai, when she toowas a People’s Commissar, why did they not teach us howto combat the evils of bureaucracy? We know that we havea touch of bureaucracy, and we, who have to deal with this bureaucratic machine at first hand, suffer as a result. 
 You sign a paper—but how is it applied in practice? How doyou check up on it, when the bureaucratic machine is soenormous? If you know how to make it smaller, dear com-rades, please share your knowledge with us! You have adesire to argue, but you give us nothing apart from general statements. 
 Instead, you indulge in demagogy pure and simple. 
 For it is sheer demagogy to say: “The specialistsare ill-treating the workers; the workers are leading a lifeof penal servitude in a toilers’ republic. 
” Comrades, I entreat you all to read this pamphlet. 
 You could not find a better argument against the Workers’ Opposition than Comrade Kollontai’s pamphlet, The Workers ’ Opposition . 
 You will see that this is really no way to approach the question. 
 We all admit that bureaucraticpractices are a vexed question, and as much is stated in ourParty Programme. 
 It is very easy to criticise the chiefadministrations and economic councils, but your kind of criticism leads the masses of non-Party workers to think they should be dissolved. 
 The Socialist-Revolutionariesseize upon this. 
 Some Ukrainian comrades have told me that Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, at their conference,63 formulated their proposals in exactly the same way. 
 And what about the Kronstadt resolutions64? You have not all read them? We will show them to you: they say the samething. 
 I emphasised the danger of Kronstadt because it liesprecisely in the fact that the change demanded was appar-ently very slight: “The Bolsheviks must go ... we willcorrect the regime a little. 
” That is what the Kronstadt rebels are demanding. 
 But what actually happened was that Savinkov arrived in Revel, the Paris newspapersreported the events a fortnight before they actually occurred,and a whiteguard general appeared on the scene. 
 That iswhat actually happened. 
 All revolutions have gone thatway. 
 That is why we are saying: Since we are faced with that sort of thing, we must unite, and, as I said in my first speech, counter it with rifles, no matter how innocent itmay appear to be. 
 To this the Workers’ Opposition does notreply, but says: “We shall not dissolve the economic coun-cils but ‘subordinate them to our guidance’. 
” The “All-Russia Congress of . 
Producers” is to subordinate to its guidance the Economic Council’s 71 chief administrations. 
 I ask you: is that a joke? Can we take them seriously? Thisis the petty-bourgeois, anarchist element not only amongthe masses of the workers, but also in our own Party; andthat is something we cannot tolerate in any circumstances. 
We have allowed ourselves a luxury: we gave these people the opportunity to express their opinions in the greatest possible detail and have heard their side of it several times. 
When I had occasion to debate with Comrades Trotsky andKiselyov at the Second Miners’ Congress, two points ofview were definitely revealed. 
 The Workers’ Oppositionsaid: “Lenin and Trotsky will unite. 
” Trotsky came out and said: “Those who fail to understand that it is necessary to unite are against the Party; of course we will unite,because we are men of the Party. 
” I supported him. 
 Ofcourse, Comrade Trotsky and I differed; and when more orless equal groups appear within the Central Committee, theParty will pass judgement, and in a way that will make us unite in accordance with the Party’s will and instructions. 
 Those are the statements Comrade Trotsky and I made atthe Miners’ Congress, and repeat here; but the Workers’ Opposition says: “We will make no concessions, but we will remain in the Party. 
” No, that trick won’t work! (Applause . 
) I repeat that in combating the evils of bureauc-racy we welcome the assistance of every worker, whateverhe may call himself, if he is sincere in his desire to help. 
This help is highly desirable if sincere. 
 In this sense wewill make “concessions” (I take the word in quotationmarks). 
 No matter how provocative the statements against us, we shall make “concessions” because we know how hard the going is. 
 We cannot dissolve the economic councils andchief administrations. 
 It is absolutely untrue to say thatwe have no confidence in the working class and that we arekeeping the workers out of the governing bodies. 
 We areon the look-out for every worker who is at all fit for mana-gerial work; we are glad to have him and give him a trial. 
 If the Party has no confidence in the working class and doesnot allow workers to occupy responsible posts, it ought tobe ousted! Go on, be logical and say it! I have said that thatis not true: we are on our last legs for want of men and weare prepared to take any assistance, with both hands, from any efficient man, especially if he is a worker. 
 But we have no men of this type, and this creates the ground for anarchy. 
We must keep up the fight against the evils of bureaucracy—and it demands hundreds of thousands of men. 
 Our Programme formulates the task of combating the evils of bureaucracy as one of extremely long duration. 
 The wider the dispersal of the peasantry, the more inevitable are bureaucratic practices at the centre. 
 It is easy to write things like this: “There is something rotten in our Party. 
” You know what weakening the Sovietapparatus means when there are two million Russian émigrésabroad. 
 They were driven out by the Civil War. 
 They have gratified us by holding their meetings in Berlin, Paris, London, and all the other capitals but ours. 
 They supportthis element that is called the small producer, the petty-bourgeois element. 
 We shall do everything that can be done to eliminate bureaucratic practices by promoting workers from below, and we shall accept every piece of practical advice on this matter. 
 Even if we give this the inappropriate name of“concessions”, as some here have done, there is no doubt that, despite this pamphlet, 99 per cent of the Congress will say, “In spite of this we will make ‘concessions’ and win over all that is sound. 
” Take your place by the side of the workers and teach us how to combat the evils of bureauc-racy, if you know how to do it better than we do; butdon’t talk as Shlyapnikov has done. 
 That is not the sortof thing that one can brush aside. 
 I shall not deal with thetheoretical part of his speech because Kollontai said the same thing. 
 I shall deal with the facts he quoted. 
 He said that potatoes were rotting, and asked why Tsyurupa wasnot being prosecuted. 
 But I ask: Why is Shlyapnikov not prosecuted for making such statements? Are we seriously discussing discipline andunity in an organised Party, or are we at a meeting of the Kronstadt type? For his is a Kronstadt, anarchist type of statement, to which the response is a gun. 
 We organisedmembers of the Party, have come here to rectify ourmistakes. 
 If Shlyapnikov thinks that Tsyurupa ought to beprosecuted, why had he not, as an organised member ofthe Party, lodged a complaint with the Control Commission? When we were setting up the Control Commission, we said: The Central Committee is swamped with administrativework. 
 Let us elect people who enjoy the confidence of theworkers, who will not have so much administrative workand will be able to examine complaints on behalf of theCentral Committee. 
 This created a means of developing crit-icism and rectifying mistakes. 
 If Tsyurupa was so wrong why was not a complaint lodged with the Control Com-mission? Instead, Shlyapnikov comes to the Congress, themost responsible assembly of the Party and the Republic,and starts hurling accusations about rotting potatoes, andasking why Tsyurupa is not being prosecuted. 
 But I ask, doesn’t the Defence Department make any mistakes? Are not battles lost and waggons and supplies abandoned? Shallwe then prosecute the military workers? Comrade Shlyap-nikov comes here and hurls accusations which he himselfdoes not believe, and which he cannot prove. 
 Potatoes arerotting. 
 Of course, many mistakes will be made, for our machinery wants adjustment, and our transport is not running smoothly. 
 But when instead of a rectification of ourmistakes such accusations are hurled at random, and when, in addition—as several comrades here have noted—there is an undertone of malice in this question of why Tsyurupa is not being prosecuted, then I say: Why not prosecute us, the Central Committee? We think that such talk isdemagogy. 
 Either proceedings should be started againstTsyurupa and us, or against Shlyapnikov; but no work can bedone in such a spirit. 
 When Party comrades talk as Shlyap-nikov has done here—and he always talks like that at other meetings—and Comrade Kollontai’s pamphlet says the same thing, although she mentions no names, we say: Wecannot go on like this, for it is the kind of demagogy thatthe Makhno anarchists and the Kronstadt elements jumpat. 
 We are both members of the Party, and both of us arestanding before this most responsible tribunal. 
 If Tsyurupa has committed an unlawful act and we, the Central Com-mittee, have condoned it, then why not come out with adefinite charge, instead of throwing about words that willbe caught up here, in Moscow, tomorrow, and immediatelycarried by the grapevine telegraph to the bourgeoisie. 
 To-morrow all the gossips in the Soviet offices will be rubbing their hands in glee and repeating your words with delight. 
 If Tsyurupa is the kind of man Shlyapnikov accuses himof being, and if, as he demands, he ought to be prosecuted,then I say that we must seriously ponder over his words;such accusations are not lightly made. 
 Those who makeaccusations of this sort should be either removed from the Party or told: We are putting you on this potato job; you go to such and such a gubernia and let’s see whether youhave less rotting potatoes than in the gubernias underTsyurupa’s charge. 
 4 PRELIMINARY DRAFT RESOLUTION ON IMPROVING THE CONDITION OF WORKERS AND NEEDY PEASANTS The exhaustion caused by the privation and the calami-ties and havoc of the seven-year war, and the overstraindue to the virtually superhuman exertions on the part of the working class of Russia over the past three and a half years, have now been so aggravated that they demandurgent measures on the part of the Soviet power. 
 The Tenth Congress of the R. 
C. 
P. 
 accordingly demands that the whole Party and all Party and Soviet establish-ments should redouble their attention to this question and immediately work out measures to improve the condition of the workers and ease their hardships at all costs. 
 The Congress approves of the decision taken by the Central Committee and the Soviet Government to release apart of the gold reserve for the purchase of consumer goodsfor the workers, and demands an extension of this measure and an immediate amendment, with that end in view, of our import plan. 
 The Congress authorises the Central Committee to set up a special Central Commission to implement urgent measuresto improve the condition of the workers, which should beorganised in such a way as to work in close contact with, on the one hand, the Central Committee of the R. 
C. 
P. 
 and the All-Russia Central Council of Trade Unions, and, onthe other, with the Council of People’s Commissars andthe Council of Labour and Defence, for the swiftest imple-mentation of the measures to be adopted, and to allow theworkers themselves to exercise control over the implementa-tion of these measures. 
 The Commission must set up sub-commissions in the Commissariats which are in the bestposition right away to assign a part of their machinery and resources to help improve the condition of the workers (People’s Commissariats for Foreign Trade, Food, Defence, and Health, the Government Buildings Committee, etc. 
). 
 Sub-commissions are especially needed in the gubernias whereindustrial workers are chiefly concentrated. 
 The Congressentrusts the Central Committee and Party workers of theCommissariats concerned to work out an ordinance governingthe operation of these commissions without delay. 
 In view of the acute hardships inflicted on the peasantry by the crop failure—in very many cases aggravated by thedemobilisation of the army—the Tenth Congress authorisesthe Central Committee to take, through the Council ofPeople’s Commissars and the All-Russia Central ExecutiveCommittee, measures similar to those outlined above to improve the condition of needy peasants, without confining itself to the commission earlier set up for that purposeby the All-Russia Central Executive Committee. 
 Published according to the manuscript 5 SPEECH ON THE TRADE UNIONS MARCH 14 Comrades, Comrade Trotsky was particularly polite in his polemics with me today and reproached me for being, or said that I was, extremely cautious. 
 I thank him for the compliment, but regret that I cannot return it. 
 On thecontrary, I must speak of my incautious friend, so as toexpress my attitude to the mistake which has caused me towaste so much time, and which is now making us continuethe debate on the trade union question, instead of dealing with more urgent matters. 
 Comrade Trotsky had his final say in the discussion on the trade union question in Pravda of January 29, 1921. 
 In his article, “There Are Disagree-ments, But Why Confuse Things?”, he accused me of beingresponsible for this confusion by asking who started itall. 
 The accusation recoils on Trotsky, for he is trying to shift the blame. 
 The whole of his article was based on the claim that he had raised the question of the role of the tradeunions in production, and that this is the subject that oughtto have been discussed. 
 This is not true; it is not this thathas caused the disagreements, and made them painful. 
And however tedious it may be after the discussion to have to repeat it again and again—true, I took part in it for only one month—I must restate that that was not the starting-point; it started with the “shake-up” slogan that was pro-claimed at the Fifth All-Russia Conference of Trade Unions onNovember 2-6. 
 65 Already at that time it was realised by every-one who had not overlooked Rudzutak’s resolution—and among those were the members of the Central Committee, including myself—that no disagreements could be found onthe role of the trade unions in production. 
 But the three month discussion revealed them. 
 They existed, and they were a political mistake. 
 During a discussion at the Bol-shoi Theatre, Comrade Trotsky accused me before respon-sible Party workers of disrupting the discussion. 
66 I take that as a compliment: I did try to disrupt the discussionin the form it was being conducted, because with a severespring ahead of us such pronouncements were harmful. 
Only the blind could have failed to see that. 
 Comrade Trotsky now laughs at my asking who started it all, and is surprised that I should reproach him for refusingto serve on the commission. 
 I did it because this is veryimportant, Comrade Trotsky, very important, indeed; yourrefusal to serve on the trade union commission was a vio-lation of Central Committee discipline. 
 And when Trotsky talks about it, the result is not a controversy, but a shake-up of the Party, and a generation of bitter feeling; it leadsto extremes—Comrade Trotsky used the expression “dia-bolical rage”. 
 I recall an expression used by Comrade Holtz-mann—I will not quote it because the word “diabolical”calls to mind something fiendish, whereas Holtzmann reminds one of something angelic. 
 There is nothing “diabolical” about it, but we must not forget that both sides go toextremes, and, what is much more monstrous, some of thenicest comrades have gone to extremes. 
 But when ComradeTrotsky’s authority was added to this, and when in a pub-lic speech on December 25 he said that the Congress must choose between two trends, such words are unpardonable! They constitute the political mistake over which we arefighting. 
 And it is naïve for people to try to be witty abouttwo-room conferences. 
 I should like to see the wag whosays that Congress delegates are forbidden to confer to pre-vent their votes from being split. 
 That would be too much of an exaggeration. 
 It was Comrade Trotsky and Tsektran’s political mistake to raise the “shake-up” question and to doit in an entirely wrong way. 
 That was a political mistake,and it is yet to be rectified. 
 As regards transport, we havea resolution. 
 67 What we are discussing is the trade union movement, and the relationship between the vanguard of the working class and the proletariat. 
 There is nothing discreditable in ourdismissing anybody from a high post. 
 This casts no reflec-tion upon anybody. 
 If you have made a mistake the Congress will recognise it as such and will restore mutual relations and mutual confidence between the vanguard of the working class and the workers’ mass. 
 That is the meaning of the“Platform of Ten”. 
 68 It is of no importance that there are things in it that can be substituted, and that this is empha-sised by Trotsky and enlarged upon by Ryazanov. 
 Someonesaid in a speech that there is no evidence of Lenin’s having taken a hand in the platform or of his having taken any part in drafting it. 
 I say to this: If I had a hand, by writingor phoning, in everything I sign, I would have gone madlong ago. 
 I say that in order to establish mutual relationsand mutual confidence between the vanguard of the workingclass and the workers’ mass, it was necessary, if Tsektran had made a mistake—and anyone can make a mistake—to rectify it. 
 But it is a source of political danger to defend themistake. 
 We would have been faced with politicalbankruptcy if we had not done everything we could to turnthe attitudes expressed here by Kutuzov to the service ofdemocracy. 
 Persuasion must come before coercion. 
 We must make every effort to persuade people before applying coer-cion. 
 We were not able to carry conviction to the broadmasses, and disturbed the correct relationship between themand the vanguard. 
 When people like Kutuzov devote part of a business-like speech to pointing out the scandalous bureaucratic practices in our machinery we say: That is true, our state is one with bureaucratic distortions. 
 And we invite the non-Partyworkers to join us in righting them. 
 I must say here thatwe should enlist comrades like Kutuzov for this work andpromote them. 
 That is the lesson of our experience. 
 As for the syndicalist deviation—it is ridiculous. 
 That is all we have to say to Shlyapnikov, who maintained that the “All-Russia Congress of Producers”, a demand set downin black and white in their platform and confirmed byKollontai, can be upheld by a reference to Engels. 
 Engelsspeaks of a communist society which will have no classes, andwill consist only of producers. 
 69 Do we now have classes? Yes, we do. 
 Do we have a class struggle? Yes, and a most furious one! To come in the midst of this furious class struggleand talk about an “All-Russia Congress of Producers ”— isn’t that a syndicalist deviation which must be emphati-cally and irrevocably condemned? We saw that in this plat-form hurly-burly even Bukharin was tripped up by the one-third nomination proposal. 
 Comrades, in the history ofthe Party we must not forget such waverings. 
 And now, since the Workers’ Opposition has defended democracy, and has made some sound demands, we shall doour utmost to mend our fences with it; and the Congress as such should make a definite selection. 
 You say that we are not doing enough to combat the evils of bureaucracy—come and help us, come closer and help us in the fight;but it is not a Marxist, not a communist notion to proposean “All-Russia Congress of Producers”. 
 The Workers’Opposition, with Ryazanov’s help, is putting a false con-struction on our Programme which says: “The trade unions should eventually arrive at a de facto concentration in their hands of the whole administration of the whole nationaleconomy, as a single economic entity. 
” 70 Exaggerating, as he always does, Shlyapnikov thinks that it will take ustwenty-five centuries .... 
 The Programme says: the trade unions “should eventually arrive”, and when a Congress says that this has been done, the demand will have been carriedout. 
 Comrades, if the Congress now declares before the pro-letariat of the whole of Russia and of the whole world thatit regards the proposals of the Workers’ Opposition as a syndicalist semi-deviation, I am sure that all the truly proletarian and sound elements in the opposition will followus and help us to regain the confidence of the masses,which has been shaken by Tsektran’s slight mistake. 
 I amsure that we shall strengthen and rally our ranks in a com-mon effort and march forward together to the hard struggle that lies ahead. 
 And marching forward unanimously, with firmness and resolution, we shall win out. 
 ( Applause . 
) 6 REPORT ON THE SUBSTITUTION OF A TAX IN KIND FOR THE SURPLUS GRAIN APPROPRIATION SYSTEM MARCH 15 Comrades, the question of substituting a tax for surplus-grain appropriation is primarily and mainly a political question, for it is essentially a question of the attitude of the working class to the peasantry. 
 We are raisingit because we must subject the relations of these two mainclasses, whose struggle or agreement determines the fateof our revolution as a whole, to a new or, I should perhapssay, a more careful and correct re-examination and some revision. 
 There is no need for me to dwell in detail on the reasons for it. 
 You all know very well of course whattotality of causes, especially those due to the extremewant arising out of the war, ruin, demobilisation, and thedisastrous crop failure—you know about the totality ofcircumstances that has made the condition of the peasantry especially precarious and critical and was bound to increase its swing from the proletariat to the bourgeoisie. 
 A word or two on the theoretical significance of, or the theoretical approach to, this issue. 
 There is no doubt thatin a country where the overwhelming majority of the popu-lation consists of small agricultural producers, a socialist revolution can be carried out only through the implemen-tation of a whole series of special transitional measures whichwould be superfluous in highly developed capitalist coun-tries where wage-workers in industry and agriculture makeup the vast majority. 
 Highly developed capitalist coun-tries have a class of agricultural wage-workers that has taken shape over many decades. 
 Only such a class can socially, economically, and politically support a directtransition to socialism. 
 Only in countries where this class is sufficiently developed is it possible to pass directly from capitalism to socialism, without any special country-wide transitional measures. 
 We have stressed in a good many written works, in all our public utterances, and all ourstatements in the press, that this is not the case in Russia,for here industrial workers are a minority and petty farm-ers are the vast majority. 
 In such a country, the socialistrevolution can triumph only on two conditions. 
 First, if it is given timely support by a socialist revolution in one or several advanced countries. 
 As you know, we have donevery much indeed in comparison with the past to bringabout this condition, but far from enough to make it areality. 
 The second condition is agreement between the proletar-iat, which is exercising its dictatorship, that is, holds state power, and the majority of the peasant population. 
 Agree-ment is a very broad concept which includes a whole series ofmeasures and transitions. 
 I must say at this point that ourpropaganda and agitation must be open and above-board. 
We must condemn most resolutely those who regard politics as a series of cheap little tricks, frequently bordering on deception. 
 Their mistakes have to be corrected. 
 You can’tfool a class. 
 We have done very much in the past three yearsto raise the political consciousness of the masses. 
 Theyhave been learning most from the sharp struggles. 
 In keepingwith our world outlook, the revolutionary experience we have accumulated over the decades, and the lessons of our revolution, we must state the issues plainly—the interestsof these two classes differ, the small farmer does not wantthe same thing as the worker. 
 We know that so long as there is no revolution in other countries, only agreement with the peasantry can save the socialist revolution in Russia. 
 And that is how it must be I stated, frankly, at all meetings and in the entire press. 
 Weknow that this agreement between the working class and thepeasantry is not solid—to put it mildly, without enteringthe word “mildly” in the minutes—but, speaking plainly,it is very much worse. 
 Under no circumstances must we try to hide anything; we must plainly state that the peasantry is dissatisfied with the form of our relations, that it doesnot want relations of this type and will not continue to live as it has hitherto. 
 This is unquestionable. 
 The peas-antry has expressed its will in this respect definitely enough. 
 It is the will of the vast masses of the working population. 
 We must reckon with this, and we are sober enough poli-ticians to say frankly: let us re-examine our policy in regardto the peasantry. 
 The state of affairs that has prevailedso far cannot be continued any longer. 
 We must say to the peasants: “If you want to turn back, if you want to restore private property and unrestricted trade in their entirety, it will certainly and inevitablymean falling under the rule of the landowners and the cap-italists. 
 This has been proved by a number of examples fromhistory and examples of revolutions. 
 The briefest examina-tion of the ABC of communism and political economy will prove that this is inevitable. 
 Let us then look into the mat-ter. 
 Is it or is it not in the interest of the peasantry to partways with the proletariat only to slip back—and let thecountry slip back—to the rule of the capitalists and land-owners? Consider this, and let us consider it together. 
” We believe that if the matter is given proper considera-tion, the conclusion will be in our favour, in spite of the admittedly deep gulf between the economic interests ofthe proletariat and the small farmer. 
 Difficult as our position is in regard to resources, the needs of the middle peasantry must be satisfied. 
 There arefar more middle peasants now than before, the antagonisms have been smoothed out, the land has been distributed for use far more equally, the kulak’s position has been under-mined and he has been in considerable measure expropriated—in Russia more than in the Ukraine, and less in Siberia. 
On the whole, however, statistics show quite definitelythat there has been a levelling out, an equalisation, in the village, that is, the old sharp division into kulaks and cropless peasants has disappeared. 
 Everything has becomemore equable, the peasantry in general has acquired thestatus of the middle peasant. 
 Can we satisfy this middle peasantry as such, with its economic peculiarities and economic roots? Any Commu-nist who thought the economic basis, the economic roots, of small farming could be reshaped in three years was, ofcourse, a dreamer. 
 We need not conceal the fact that there were a good many such dreamers among us. 
 Nor is there anything particularly bad in this. 
 How could one start a socialist revolution in a country like ours without dreamers? Practice has, of course, shown the tremendous role all kindsof experiments and undertakings can play in the sphere ofcollective agriculture. 
 But it has also afforded instancesof these experiments as such playing a negative role, whenpeople, with the best of intentions and desires, went to the countryside to set up communes but did not know how to run them because they had no experience in collectiveendeavour. 
 The experience of these collective farms merelyprovided examples of how not to run farms: the peasantsaround either laughed or jeered. 
 You know perfectly well how many cases there have been of this kind. 
 I repeat that this is not surprising, for it will take generations to remould the small farmer, and recasthis mentality and habits. 
 The only way to solve this prob-lem of the small farmer—to improve, so to speak, his men-tality—is through the material basis, technical equipment,the extensive use of tractors and other farm machinery and electrification on a mass scale. 
 This would remake the small farmer fundamentally and with tremendous speed. 
 If I saythis will take generations, it does not mean centuries. 
 Butyou know perfectly well that to obtain tractors and othermachinery and to electrify this vast country is a matter thatmay take decades in any case. 
 Such is the objective situation. 
 We must try to satisfy the demands of the peasants who are dissatisfied and disgruntled, and legitimately so, andwho cannot be otherwise. 
 We must say to them: “Yes, thiscannot go on any longer. 
” How is the peasant to be satisfiedand what does satisfying him mean? Where is the answer?Naturally it lies in the demands of the peasantry. 
 We know these demands. 
 But we must verify them and examine all that we know of the farmer’s economic demands from thestandpoint of economic science. 
 If we go into this, we shallsee at once that it will take essentially two things tosatisfy the small farmer. 
 The first is a certain freedom ofexchange, freedom for the small private proprietor, and the second is the need to obtain commodities and products. 
 What indeed would free exchange amount to if there wasnothing to exchange, and freedom of trade, if there was nothing to trade with! It would all remain on paper, and classes cannot be satisfied with scraps of paper, they want the goods. 
 These two conditions must be clearly under-stood. 
 The second—how to get commodities and whetherwe shall be able to obtain them—we shall discuss later. 
It is the first condition—free exchange—that we must dealwith now. 
 What is free exchange? It is unrestricted trade, and that means turning back towards capitalism. 
 Free exchange and freedom of trade mean circulation of commoditiesbetween petty proprietors. 
 All of us who have studied atleast the elements of Marxism know that this exchange andfreedom of trade inevitably lead to a division of commodityproducers into owners of capital and owners of labour-power, a division into capitalists and wage-workers, i. 
e. 
, a revival of capitalist wage-slavery, which does not fall from the skybut springs the world over precisely from the agriculturalcommodity economy. 
 This we know perfectly well in theory,and anyone in Russia who has observed the small farmer’slife and the conditions under which he farms must have seen this. 
 How then can the Communist Party recognise freedom to trade and accept it? Does not the proposition contain ir-reconcilable contradictions? The answer is that the practicalsolution of the problem naturally presents exceedinglygreat difficulties. 
 I can foresee, and I know from the talks I have had with some comrades, that the preliminary draft on replacing surplus-grain appropriation by a tax—it hasbeen handed out to you—gives rise to legitimate andinevitable questions, mostly as regards permitting exchangeof goods within the framework of local economic turnover. 
This is set forth at the end of Point 8. 
 What does it mean, what limits are there to this exchange, how is it all to be implemented? Anyone who expects to get the answerat this Congress will be disappointed. 
 We shall find theanswer in our legislation; it is our task to lay down theprinciple to be followed and provide the slogan. 
 Our Partyis the government party and the decision the Party Congress passes will be obligatory for the entire Republic: it is now up to us to decide the question in principle. 
 We must dothis and inform the peasantry of our decision, for the sowing /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR season is almost at hand. 
 Further we must muster our whole administrative apparatus, all our theoretical forces and all our practical experience, in order to see how it can be done. 
 Can it be done at all, theoretically speaking: can freedomof trade, freedom of capitalist enterprise for the smallfarmer, be restored to a certain extent without underminingthe political power of the proletariat? Can it be done? Yes,it can, for everything hinges on the extent. 
 If we were able to obtain even a small quantity of goods and hold them in the hands of the state—the proletariat exercising politicalpower—and if we could release these goods into circulation,we, as the state, would add economic power to our politicalpower. 
 Release of these goods into circulation would stim-ulate small farming, which is in a terrible state and cannot develop owing to the grievous war conditions and the eco-nomic chaos. 
 The small farmer, so long as he remains small,needs a spur, an incentive that accords with his economicbasis, i. 
e. 
, the individual small farm. 
 Here you cannotavoid local free exchange. 
 If this turnover gives the state,in exchange for manufactured goods, a certain minimum amount of grain to cover urban and industrial requirements, economic circulation will be revived, with state powerremaining in the hands of the proletariat and growing strong-er. 
 The peasants want to be shown in practice that the workerwho controls the mills and factories—industry—is capableof organising exchange with the peasantry. 
 And, on the other hand, the vastness of our agricultural country with its poor transport system, boundless expanses, varyingclimate, diverse farming conditions, etc. 
, makes a certainfreedom of exchange between local agriculture and localindustry, on a local scale, inevitable. 
 In this respect, weare very much to blame for having gone too far; we overdid the nationalisation of industry and trade, clamping down on local exchange of commodities. 
 Was that a mistake?It certainly was. 
 In this respect we have made many patent mistakes, and it would be a great crime not to see it, and not to realisethat we have failed to keep within bounds, and have not known where to stop. 
 There has, of course, also been the factor of necessity—until now we have been living in theconditions of a savage war that imposed an unprecedented burden on us and left us no choice but to take war-time measures in the economic sphere as well. 
 It was a miracle that the ruined country withstood this war, yet the miracle did not come from heaven, but grew out of the economicinterests of the working class and the peasantry, whosemass enthusiasm created the miracle that defeated thelandowners and capitalists. 
 But at the same time it is anunquestionable fact that we went further than was theo-retically and politically necessary, and this should not be concealed in our agitation and propaganda. 
 We can allowfree local exchange to an appreciable extent, withoutdestroying, but actually strengthening the political powerof the proletariat. 
 How this is to be done, practice willshow. 
 I only wish to prove to you that theoretically it is conceivable. 
 The proletariat, wielding state power, can, if it has any reserves at all, put them into circulation andthereby satisfy the middle peasant to a certain extent—on the basis of local economic exchange. 
 Now a few words about local economic exchange. 
 First of all, the co-operatives. 
 They are now in an extreme state of decline, but we naturally need them as a vehicle of local economic exchange. 
 Our Programme stresses that theco-operatives left over from capitalism are the best distri-bution network and must be preserved. 
 That is what theProgramme says. 
 Have we lived up to this? To a veryslight extent, if at all, again partly because we have made mistakes, partly because of the war-time necessity. 
 The co-operatives brought to the fore the more business-like,economically more advanced elements, thereby bringingout the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries in thepolitical sphere. 
 This is a law of chemistry—you can’t doanything about it! ( Laughter . 
) The Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries are people who either consciously or unconsciously work to restore capitalism and help theYudeniches. 
 This too is a law. 
 We must fight them. 
 Andif there is to be a fight, it must be done the military way;we had to defend ourselves, and we did. 
 But do we haveto perpetuate the present situation? No, we do not. 
 It would be a mistake to tie our hands in this way. 
 Because of this I submit a resolution on the question of the co-operatives;it is very brief and I shall read it to you: “Whereas the resolution of the Ninth Congress of the R. 
C. 
P. 
 on the co-operatives is based entirely on the principle of surplus-grain appropriation, which is now superseded by a tax in kind, the Tenth Congress of the R. 
C. 
P. 
 resolves: “That the said resolution be rescinded. 
“The Congress instructs the Central Committee to draw up and carry out through Party and Soviet channels deci-sions to improve and develop the structure and activity of the co-operatives in conformity with the Programme of the R. 
C. 
P. 
 and with a view to substituting the tax in kind forthe surplus-grain appropriation system. 
” 71 You will say that this is rather vague. 
 Yes, it is, and should necessarily be so to some extent. 
 Why necessarily?Because if we are to be absolutely definite, we must know exactly what we are going to do over the year ahead. 
 Who knows that? No one. 
 But the resolution of the Ninth Congress ties our hands by calling for “subordination to the Commissariat for Food”. 
This is a fine institution, but it would be an obvious polit-ical mistake to subordinate the co-operatives to it and to no other, and to tie our hands at a time when we are review-ing our attitude to the small farmers. 
 We must instructthe newly elected Central Committee to elaborate and carryout definite measures and changes, and to check up onevery step we take forward or back—to what extent wemust act, how to uphold our political interests, how much relaxation there must be to make things easier, how to check up on the results of our experience. 
 Theoretically speaking,in this respect we are facing a number of transitional stages,or transitional measures. 
 One thing is clear: the resolutionof the Ninth Congress assumed that we would be advancingin a straight line, but it turned out, as has happened again and again throughout the history of revolutions, that the movement took a zigzag course. 
 To tie one’s hands withsuch a resolution would be a political mistake. 
 Annulling it,we say that we must be guided by our Programme, whichstresses the importance of the co-operative machinery. 
 As we annul the resolution, we say: work with a view to replacing surplus-grain appropriation by a tax. 
 But when are we to do this? Not before the harvest, that is,in a few months’ time. 
 Will it be done the same way everywhere? In no circumstances. 
 It would be the height of stupidity to apply the same pattern to central Russia, the Ukraine, and Siberia. 
 I propose that this fundamental idea of unrestricted local exchange be formulated as a decisionof this Congress. 
 72 I presume that following this decision the Central Committee will without fail send out a letterwithin the next few days and will point out—doing it betterthan I can do here (we shall find the best writers to polish up the style)—that there are to be no radical changes, no undue haste, or snap decisions, and that things should bedone so as to give maximum satisfaction to the middle peas-antry, without damaging the interests of the proletariat. 
Try one thing and another, study things in practice, throughexperience, then share your experience with us, and let us know what you have managed to do, and we shall set up a special commission or even several commissions to considerthe experience that has been accumulated. 
 I think we shouldissue a special invitation to Comrade Preobrazhensky, theauthor of Paper Money in the Epoch of the Proletarian Dictatorship . 
 This is a highly important question, for money circulation is a splendid test of the state of commodity circulation in the country; when it is unsatisfactory, moneyis not worth the paper it is printed on. 
 In order to proceedon the basis of experience, we must check and recheck themeasures we have adopted. 
 We shall be asked where the goods are to come from, for unrestricted trade requires goods, and the peasants are shrewd people and very good at scoffing. 
 Can weobtain any goods now? Today we can, for our interna-tional economic position has greatly improved. 
 Weare waging a fight against the international capital-ists, who, when they were first confronted by this Republic, called us “brigands and crocodiles” (I was told by an Eng-lish artiste 73 that she had heard these very words spoken by one of the most influential politicians). 
 Crocodiles aredespicable. 
 That was the verdict of international capital. 
It was the verdict of a class enemy and quite correct fromhis point of view. 
 However, the correctness of such conclu-sions has to be verified in practice. 
 If you are world capital —a world power—and you use words like “crocodile” andhave all the technical means at your disposal; why not try and shoot it! Capital did shoot—and got the worst of it. 
 It was then that the capitalists, who are forced to reckon with political and economic realities, declared: “We must trade. 
” This is one of our greatest victories. 
 Let me tell you thatwe now have two offers of a loan to the amount of nearlyone hundred million gold rubles. 
 We have gold, but youcan’t sell gold, because you can’t eat it. 
 Everybody hasbeen reduced to a state of impoverishment, currency relations between all the capitalist countries are incredibly chaotic as a result of the war. 
 Moreover, you need a merchantmarine to communicate with Europe, and we have none. 
It is in hostile hands. 
 We have concluded no treaty withFrance; she considers that we are her debtors and, con-sequently, that every ship we have is hers. 
 They have a navy and we have none. 
 In these circumstances we have so far been in a position to make use of our gold on a limitedand ridiculously insignificant scale. 
 Now we have twooffers from capitalist bankers to float a loan of one hundredmillion. 
 Of course, they will charge us an exorbitant rateof interest. 
 Still it is their first offer of this kind; so far they have said: “I’ll shoot you and take everything for nothing. 
” Now, being unable to shoot us, they are readyto trade with us. 
 Trade agreements with America andBritain can now be said to be almost in the bag; the sameapplies to concessions. 
 Yesterday I received another letterfrom Mr. 
 Vanderlip, who is here and who, besides numerous complaints, sets forth a whole series of plans concerning concessions and a loan. 
 He represents the shrewdest typeof finance capitalist connected with the Western States ofthe U. 
S. 
A. 
, those that are more hostile to Japan. 
 So it iseconomically possible for us to obtain goods. 
 How we shallmanage to do it is another question, but a certain possi-bility is there. 
 I repeat, the type of economic relations which on top looks like a bloc with foreign capitalism makes it possiblefor the proletarian state power to arrange for free exchangewith the peasantry below. 
 I know—and I have had occasionto say this before—that this has evoked some sneers. 
 There is a whole intellectual-bureaucratic stratum in Moscow, which is trying to shape “public opinion”. 
 “See whatcommunism has come to!” these people sneer. 
 “It’s like a man on crutches and face all bandaged up—nothing but a picture puzzle. 
” I have heard enough of gibes of this kind— they are either bureaucratic or just irresponsible. 
 Russia emerged from the war in a state that can most of all belikened to that of a man beaten to within an inch of his life; thebeating had gone on for seven years, and it’s a mercy she canhobble about on crutches! That is the situation we are in!To think that we can get out of this state without crutches is to understand nothing! So long as there is no revolution in other countries, it would take us decades to extricateourselves, and in these circumstances we cannot grudgehundreds of millions’ or even thousands of millions’ worthof our immense wealth, our rich raw material sources, inorder to obtain help from the major capitalists. 
 Later we shall recover it all and to spare. 
 The rule of the proletariat cannot be maintained in a country laid waste as no country hasever been before—a country where the vast majority arepeasants who are equally ruined—without the help ofcapital, for which, of course, exorbitant interest will beextorted. 
 This we must understand. 
 Hence, the choice is between economic relations of this type and nothing at all. 
 He who puts the question otherwise understands absolutelynothing in practical economics and is side-stepping the issueby resorting to gibes. 
 We must recognise the fact that themasses are utterly worn-out and exhausted. 
 What can youexpect after seven years of war in this country, if the more advanced countries still feel the effects of four years of war?! In this backward country, the workers, who have made unprecedented sacrifices, and the mass of the peasants arein a state of utter exhaustion after seven years of war. 
 Thiscondition borders on complete loss of working capacity. 
What is needed now is an economic breathing space. 
 We had hoped to use our gold reserve to obtain some means of pro-duction. 
 It would be best of all to make our own machines,but even if we bought them, we would thereby build upour industry. 
 To do this, however, you must have a workerand a peasant who can work; yet in most cases they are inno condition for it, they are exhausted, worn-out. 
 They must be assisted, and contrary to our old Programme the gold reserve must be used for consumer goods. 
 That Pro-gramme was theoretically correct, but practically unsound. 
 /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR I shall pass on to you some information I have here from Comrade Lezhava. 
 It shows that several hundred thousand poods of various items of food have already been bought in Lithuania, Finland, and Latvia and are being shippedin with the utmost speed. 
 Today we have learned that a dealhas been concluded in London for the purchase of 18,500,000poods of coal, which we decided to buy in order to revivethe industry of Petrograd and the textile industry. 
 If we obtain goods for the peasant, it will, of course, be a viola-tion of the Programme, an irregularity, but we must havea respite, for the people are exhausted to a point where theyare not able to work. 
 I must say a few words about the individual exchange of commodities. 
 When we speak of free exchange, we mean individual exchange of commodities, which in turn means encouraging the kulaks. 
 What are we to do? We must notclose our eyes to the fact that the switch from the appro-priation of surpluses to the tax will mean more kulaksunder the new system. 
 They will appear where they couldnot appear before. 
 This must not be combated by prohibitive measures but by association under state auspices and by government measures from above. 
 If you can give the peas-ant machines you will help him grow, and when you providemachines or electric power, tens or hundreds of thousandsof small kulaks will be wiped out. 
 Until you can supplyall that, you must provide a certain quantity of goods. 
 If you have the goods, you have the power; to preclude, deny or renounce any such possibility means making allexchange unfeasible and not satisfying the middle peasant,who will be impossible to get along with. 
 A greater propor-tion of peasants in Russia have become middle peasants,and there is no reason to fear exchange on an individual basis. 
 Everyone can give something in exchange to the state: one, his grain surplus; another, his garden produce;a third, his labour. 
 Basically the situation is this: we mustsatisfy the middle peasantry economically and go overto free exchange; otherwise it will be impossible—economi-cally impossible—in view of the delay in the world revo-lution, to preserve the rule of the proletariat in Russia. 
 We must clearly realise this and not be afraid to say it. 
 In thedraft decision to substitute a tax in kind for the surplus appropriation system (the text has been handed out to you) you will find many discrepancies, even contradictions, and that is why we have added these words at the end: “The Congress, approving in substance [this is a rather looseword covering a great deal of ground] the propositionssubmitted by the Central Committee to substitute a tax inkind for surplus-grain appropriation, instructs the CentralCommittee of the Party to co-ordinate these propositions with the utmost dispatch. 
” We know that they have not been co-ordinated, for we had no time to do so. 
 We did not gointo the details. 
 The ways of levying the tax in practicewill be worked out in detail and the tax implementedby a law issued by the All-Russia Central ExecutiveCommittee and the Council of People’s Commissars. 
 The procedure outlined is this: if you adopt the draft today, it will be given the force of a decision at the very first sessionof the All-Russia Central Executive Committee, whichwill not issue a law either, but modified regulations; theCouncil of People’s Commissars and the Council of Labourand Defence will later make them into a law, and, what is still more important, issue practical instructions. 
 It is important that people in the localities should understandthe significance of this and help us. 
 Why must we replace surplus appropriation by a tax? Surplus appropriation implied confiscation of all surplusesand establishment of a compulsory state monopoly. 
 We could not do otherwise, for our need was extreme. 
 Theoretically speaking, state monopoly is not necessarily the best systemfrom the standpoint of the interests of socialism. 
 A systemof taxation and free exchange can be employed as atransitional measure in a peasant country possessing anindustry—if this industry is running—and if there is a cer-tain quantity of goods available. 
 The exchange is an incentive, a spur to the peasant. 
 The proprietor can and will surely make an effort in hisown interest when he knows that all his surplus producewill not be taken away from him and that he will onlyhave to pay a tax, which should whenever possible be fixed in advance. 
 The basic thing is to give the small farmer an incentive and a spur to till the soil. 
 We must adaptour state economy to the economy of the middle peasant, which we have not managed to remake in three years, and will not be able to remake in another ten. 
 The state had to face definite responsibilities in the sphere of food. 
 Because of this the appropriation quotaswere increased last year. 
 The tax must be smaller. 
 Theexact figures have not been defined, nor can they be defined. 
Popov’s booklet, Grain Production of the Soviet and Feder-ated Republics , gives the exact data issued by our Central Statistical Board and shows why agricultural production has fallen off. 
 If there is a crop failure, surpluses cannot be collected because there will be none. 
 They would have to be taken outof the peasants’ mouths. 
 If there is a crop, everybody willgo moderately hungry and the state will be saved, or it will perish, unless we take from people who do not eat their fill as it is. 
 This is what we must make clear in ourpropaganda among the peasants. 
 A fair harvest will meana surplus of up to five hundred million poods. 
 This willcover consumption and yield a certain reserve. 
 The impor-tant thing is to give the peasants an economic incentive. 
 The small proprietor must be told: “It is your job as a pro-prietor to produce, and the state will take a minimum tax. 
”My time is nearly up, I must close; I repeat: we cannotissue a law now. 
 The trouble with our resolution is that itis not sufficiently legislative—laws are not written atParty congresses. 
 Hence we propose that the resolution submitted by the C. 
C. 
 be adopted as a basis and that the C. 
C. 
 be instructed to co-ordinate the various propositionscontained in it. 
 We shall print the text of the resolutionand Party officials in the various localities will try toco-ordinate and correct it. 
 It cannot be co-ordinated frombeginning to end; this is an insoluble problem, for life is too varied. 
 To find the transitional measures is a very difficult task. 
 If we are unable to do this quickly anddirectly, we must not lose heart, for we shall win throughin the end. 
 No peasant with the slightest glimmer ofpolitical consciousness will fail to understand that we,as the government, represent the working class and all those working people with whom the labouring peasants (and they make up nine-tenths of the total) can agree, that anyturn back will mean a return to the old, tsarist government. 
 The experience of Kronstadt proves this. 
 There they do not want either the whiteguards or our government—and there is no other—and as a result they find themselves in a situation which speaks best of all in our favour andagainst any new government. 
 We are now in a position to come to an agreement with the peasants, and this must be done in practice, skilfully,efficiently, and flexibly. 
 We are familiar with the apparatus of the Commissariat for Food and know that it is one of the best we have. 
 We see that it is better than that of theothers and we must preserve it. 
 Administrative machi-nery, however, must be subordinated to politics. 
 Thesplendid apparatus of the Commissariat for Food will beuseless if we cannot establish proper relations with the peasants, for otherwise this splendid apparatus will be serving Denikin and Kolchak, and not our own class. 
 Sinceresolute change, flexibility and skilful transition havebecome politically necessary, the leaders must realise it. 
A strong apparatus must be suitable for any manoeuvre,but struggle is inevitable when its strength makes it unwieldy and hampers change. 
 All efforts must, therefore, be turned to achieving our aim: the complete subordina-tion of the apparatus to politics. 
 Politics are relations be-tween classes, and that will decide the fate of our Republic. 
The stronger the apparatus, as an auxiliary, the better andmore suitable it is for manoeuvring. 
 If it cannot manoeuvre, it is of no use to us. 
 I ask you to bear in mind this basic fact—it will take several months to work out the details and interpretations. 
The chief thing to bear in mind at the moment is that wemust let the whole world know, by wireless this very night,of our decision; we must announce that this Congress of the government party is, in the main, replacing the surplus appropriation system by a tax and is giving the small farmercertain incentives to expand his farm and plant more; thatby embarking on this course the Congress is correctingthe system of relations between the proletariat and thepeasantry and expresses its conviction that in this way these relations will be made durable. 
 ( Stormy applause . 
) 7 SUMMING -UP SPEECH ON THE TAX IN KIND MARCH 15 Comrades, I think I can confine myself to a few fairly brief remarks. 
 First of all, the question of the Siberian food supply workers. 
 Yaroslavsky and Danishevsky have asked me to make the following statement. 
 Drozhzhin hasbeen put on trial to prove that he is not guilty. 
 I can hearsceptical remarks, but at all events it must be said thatthis course is correct. 
 We hear a lot of scandal and gossip,and this is the proper way of proving them to be false. 
 Then again, a number of food supply workers in Tyumen have been shot for flogging, torture, rape and other crimes. 
Consequently, in no circumstances can this be connectedwith food supply work, but should be regarded as criminaloutrages calling for harsher penalties than usual, in viewof the conditions in which the food supply work is proceed-ing. 
 From this aspect, therefore, the measures adopted were correct. 
 I should now like to start by saying a few words about the question of the co-operatives. 
 Comrade Tsyu-rupa’s report—as we all heard him say here—was not aco-report presenting a point of view opposite to that of the chief rapporteur. 
 The Central Committee’s decision to sub-stitute a tax for the surplus-grain appropriation system wasadopted with such obvious unanimity—and what is mostimportant, we saw at once, even before the Congress opened,that various comrades in the localities had arrived at thesame conclusions independently of this decision, on the basis of their own practical experience—that it is essen-tially impossible to doubt that as a measure it is properand necessary. 
 In his report, Comrade Tsyurupa added a few suggestions and warnings on a number of questions, but he did not propose a different policy. 
 The only departure from this general line in his report was made on the question of the co-operatives. 
 He opposedmy draft resolution, but I’m afraid his arguments do notcarry conviction. 
 We can hardly determine just now howrelations in local free economic exchange will develop,and how the fund is to be handled—through co-operative societies or the restoration of small private trade. 
 This question must certainly be examined, and in this respectwe must make a careful study of local experience; that, ofcourse, is something we all agree upon. 
 I think, however,that the co-operative societies still present certain advan-tages. 
 In so far as, politically—I have already pointed this out—they serve as centres for the organisation, centralisa-tion and amalgamation of elements politically hostile tous and are in effect pursuing a Kolchak and Denikin policy,the co-operatives are only another form of small economyand small trade. 
 Every emergence of the kulaks and thedevelopment of petty-bourgeois relations evidently give rise to corresponding political parties, which had been developing in Russia for decades, and with which we arequite familiar. 
 The choice before us is not whether or notto allow these parties to grow—they are inevitably engen-dered by petty-bourgeois economic relations. 
 The onlychoice before us, and a limited one at that, is between the forms of concentration and co-ordination of these parties’ activities. 
 It cannot possibly be proved that the co-operatives are worse in this respect. 
 On the contrary, theCommunists will have somewhat greater opportunities to exertsystematic influence and control over the co-operatives. 
 The resolution on the co-operatives passed by the Ninth Congress was strongly defended here by Comrade Tsyurupa, and strongly opposed by Comrade Milyutin. 
 Incidentally, Comrade Tsyurupa said that I had been a witness to the struggle over the question of co-operativesbefore it was settled by the Congress. 
 I must corroboratethis. 
 Indeed, there was a struggle, and the resolution adopted by the Ninth Congress put a stop to it by ensuring greater predominance, or it would be more exact to saycomplete predominance, for the Food Supply Department. 
 But it would, undoubtedly, be politically wrong, on these grounds, to forego greater freedom of action and freedom of choice of political measures in respect of the co-operatives. 
 In my capacity of, say, Chairman of the Councilof People’s Commissars, I find it much more unpleasant tohave to watch this petty strife, and even bickering, atscores of meetings, than to have the backing of a Congressresolution, which is binding on all and which puts a stop to this struggle. 
 But we must not be swayed by such conveniences, but must look to the interests of a definiteeconomic policy. 
 You have all seen here, and the large numberof notes—a great pile of notes—that I have received confirmit even more strikingly, that in this concrete question avast number of difficulties of detail arise in the course of changing our policy. 
 That is the whole point. 
 And there is no doubt whatever that we shall be unable to solve themat one stroke. 
 If we allow the resolution on the co-operatives adopted by the Ninth Congress to remain in forcewe shall have our hands tied. 
 We shall put ourselves in aposition where, being entirely subordinate to the Congress and bound to pursue its policy, we shall be unable to depart from the letter of this resolution. 
 The resolutionrepeatedly refers to the surplus-grain appropriation system,but we are substituting a tax for it. 
 We have no idea how much latitude we shall leave to economic exchange. 
 That we must allow some is beyond doubt, and we must take account of and verify the economic conditions for it. 
That is why, of course, if we rescind the resolution of theNinth Congress we shall be back where the question, whichseems to have been closed to some extent, becomes an openone again. 
 This is absolutely inevitable. 
 To evade it would mean basically to prejudice the economic policy relations which we have outlined and which are, undoubtedly, moreacceptable to the peasants. 
 There is evidently no difference of opinion at this Congress, or among Communists in general, as to whetherthe switch from appropriation to a tax is a more acceptable economic policy for the peasants. 
 And we have a number of statements to this effect from non-Party peasants aswell. 
 This has been definitely established, and it alone suggests that we ought to have the change. 
 Let me, therefore, read you the resolution on the co-operatives again: “Whereas the resolution of the Ninth Congress of the R. 
C. 
P. 
 on the co-operatives is based entirely on the prin-ciple of surplus-grain appropriation, which is now supersededby a tax in kind, the Tenth Congress of the R. 
C. 
P. 
 resolves: “That the said resolution be rescinded. 
“The Congress instructs the Central Committee to draw up and carry out through Party and Soviet channels decisions to improve and develop the structure and activityof the co-operatives in conformity with the Programme ofthe R. 
C. 
P. 
 and with a view to substituting the tax in kindfor the surplus-grain appropriation system. 
” On behalf of the Central Committee, I shall ask the Congress to adopt the first resolution—the preliminary draft on substituting a tax for the surplus-grain appropria-tion system—to adopt it as a basis and instruct the CentralCommittee of the Party to co-ordinate the proposals, makethe final draft and submit it to the All-Russia CentralExecutive Committee; and also the second resolution on the co-operatives. 
 I now come to the remarks made here. 
 I must say that the questions I have received in writing are so numerous,there is such a heap of them, that not only am I unableto enumerate the subjects they touch upon, but I am com-pelled to give up the effort to classify them all in a suitable way for discussion here. 
 I regret to say that I am compelled to abandon this task, but I will keep these notes as materialfor any future discussion of the subject. 
 Perhaps it will be possible to utilise them in greater detail in the press, or, at all events, to collect and classifythem and then compile a detailed and really full summary for the benefit of the comrades economists, executives and political leaders who will be directly engaged in the taskof drafting the law substituting the tax for surplus appropri-ation. 
 At present, I can only select the two main trendsand say a few words about the two main objections orremarks about the two main types or groups of questions raised in these notes. 
 The first deals with technical questions: these are nume-rous and detailed references to the difficulties and the many problems that will arise in carrying out these measures. 
 I pointed out in my report that this was absolutely inevi-table and that it is quite impossible at present to determine at once how we shall proceed to solve these difficulties. 
 The second deals with general principles of economic policy. 
 Many, I should say most, of the speakers, and thesewritten questions, all pointed to the inevitable increasein the strength of the petty bourgeoisie, the bourgeoisie and capitalism. 
 A number of comrades wrote in their notes: “This is throwing open the door for the development of abourgeoisie, small industry and capitalist relationships. 
”In answer to this, comrades, I must say, repeating somethingof what I said in my report: There is no doubt whateverthat the transition from capitalism to socialism is con-ceivable in different forms, depending upon whether big capitalist or small production relationships predominatein the country. 
 And I must say on this score that criticismwas expressed of certain conclusions drawn from my speechon the relation between state capitalism and free small-scale exchange; but no one has criticised my propositions, nor were they criticised in any of the notes I have received (I have read most of them, and they run to several dozen). 
Direct transition to communism would have been possibleif ours was a country with a predominantly—or, say, highlydeveloped—large-scale industry, and a high level of large-scale production in agriculture, otherwise the transition to communism is economically impossible. 
 Comrade Milyu-tin said that we had a harmonious system, and that ourlaws represented, as he put it, to a certain extent, a harmo-nious system for such a transition, which, however, did nottake account of the necessity of having to make a numberof concessions to the petty bourgeoisie. 
 But having said that, Comrade Milyutin drew a different conclusion from mine. 
 The harmonious system that has been created wasdictated by war and not by economic requirements, con-siderations or conditions. 
 There was no other way out inthe conditions of the unexampled ruin in which we foundourselves, when after a big war we were obliged to endure a number of civil wars. 
 We must state quite definitely that in pursuing our policy, we may have made mistakes andgone to extremes in a number of cases. 
 But in the war-time conditions then prevailing, the policy was in the main a correct one. 
 We had no alternative but to resort to wholesale and instant monopoly, including the confiscation of all sur-plus stocks, even without compensation. 
 That was the onlyway we could tackle the task. 
 That was not a harmoniouseconomic system; it was not a measure called forth byeconomic conditions, but one largely dictated to us by warconditions. 
 The main economic consideration now is to increase the quantity of products. 
 Our principal productive forces, the peasants and workers, are in such a state ofimpoverishment, ruin, weariness and exhaustion that fora time we must subordinate everything to this main con-sideration—increasing the quantity of products at all costs. 
 Some ask: What connection is there between the substitution of a tax for the surplus-grain appropriation system and the sowing campaign now in progress? In theirnotes, the comrades strive to expose a number of contra-dictions. 
 I think that, in the main, there is economicconsistency here, and not contradiction. 
 The sowing cam-paign is based on a number of measures directed towards taking the utmost possible advantage of all economic opportunities to increase the sown area. 
 For this purpose,we must redistribute the seed, store it properly and trans-port it. 
 But scanty as our seed stocks are, we are unableto transport them; very often we are compelled to resortto various forms of mutual aid to reduce the area left unsown to a minimum and to eliminate it altogether, in spite of the appalling shortage of implements. 
 That is outof the question in a number of gubernias. 
 If the non-Partypeasants, who in very many cases have themselves demandedthe switch to the tax—for it gives them an incentive todevelop their farms on the present economic basis—are definitely told by the state authorities before the spring campaign that this measure has been decided upon andwill be applied—does that run counter to the general policyof the sowing campaign? No, it does not; it is a measurethat introduces an element of encouragement. 
 I know thatit will be said that this is a very small element of encourage-ment. 
 But that is not the point. 
 It would, of course, be something much more real, if we could immediately showthe peasants dozens of ships on their way from Britain with goods to be exchanged for the grain they collect in the coming harvest. 
 But it would be ridiculous to attempt to deceive people who have practical knowledge of the state of our commerce. 
 We know that ships loaded with coaland a small quantity of foodstuffs are leaving Britain; wehave the information from Comrade Krasin. 
 We knowthat pending the conclusion of a trade agreement, whichhas not been signed yet, semi-legal commerce is being carried on with individual merchants whom the bourgeois government cannot, of course, prohibit from trading withus. 
 It is a difficult task to break through the economicblockade, and, of course, we cannot make any great promises. 
At all events, we are doing all we can, and we are alteringthe imports plan accordingly. 
 From the standpoint of the small proprietor, the small farmer, the tax, which is to be smaller than surplus ap-propriation, will be more definite and will enable him tosow more, and assure him of the opportunity of using hissurplus to improve his farm. 
 From his standpoint, it is apolicy of rendering the utmost assistance to the industrious farmer, and this is being emphasised in the sowing campaign. 
 In the last analysis, all the objections can be reduced tothe following: Who will gain most by this—the petty bour-geoisie, which is economically hostile to communism, orlarge-scale industry, which is the basis of the transitionto socialism and—in the light of the state of the productive forces, that is, the touchstone of social development—is the basis of socialist economic organisation, for it unitesthe advanced industrial workers, the class which is exercis-ing the dictatorship of the proletariat? Several speakers tried to prove or draw the economic deduction that the petty bourgeoisie—handicraft com-modity production—will undoubtedly gain most; and they urged this particularly on the grounds that as a result ofour granting concessions, large-scale industry will ceaseto be socialist. 
 I think there is fundamental economicerror in these arguments. 
 Even if it could be definitelyproved that small industry will gain most, relatively, or even, say, absolutely, it would not, either theoretically or practically, disprove the correctness of the steps we aretaking. 
 The fact is that there is no other basis for the eco-nomic consolidation of our work of building socialism. 
 Let us assume—purely for the sake of example and illustration— that small industry has a value of 100 (100 million work units, or 100 units of any other kind, it makes no difference)and large-scale industry, 200. 
 Let us assume that on acapitalist basis small industry increases to 175, while large-scale industry remains at 200. 
 We are assuming stagnaion in large-scale industry and an enormous development of small industry. 
 I think that even this worst assumption that I have made would represent an undoubted gain forus because at present, as this year’s experience has shown,as our fuel and transport conditions indicate, and as thefood distribution—which Comrade Milyutin very oppor-tunely reminded us of—is showing, we are barely holding on. 
 Speakers here have asked, and I have received written questions to the same effect: “How will you retain theworkers’ state, if capitalism develops in the rural areas?”This peril—the development of small production and ofthe petty bourgeoisie in the rural areas—is an extremely serious one. 
 I now come to concessions. 
 They signify a bloc with capitalism in the advanced countries. 
 We must be clear inour minds about the nature of concessions. 
 They signifyan economic alliance, a bloc, a contract with advancedfinance capital in the advanced countries, a contract that will give us a slight increase in products, but will also result in an increase in the products of the concessionaires. 
If we give the latter ore or timber, they will take the lion’sshare and leave us a small share. 
 But it is so important forus to increase the quantity of products at our commandthat even a small share will be an enormous gain for us. 
 Even a slight improvement in the condition of the urban workers, which will be guaranteed in the concessions agree-ment, and will not present the slightest difficulty to foreigncapital, will be a gain and will serve to strengthen ourlarge-scale industry. 
 And this, as a result of its economicinfluence, will serve to improve the condition of the prole-tariat, the class which is wielding political power. 
 There is no ground to fear that small-scale agriculture and small industry will grow to dimensions that may prove dangerous for our large-scale industry. 
 There must be certain signs for the rise of industry. 
 If we have a bad harvest (I have already mentioned Popov’s pamphlet), and our resources are as scanty as theywere last year, an abatement of the crisis and developmentof small industry are out of the question: capitalist rela-tions can be restored only if agricultural industry yieldsa surplus. 
 That is possible, and this is very important, for it represents a material gain for us. 
 The question of whether small or large-scale production will gain morewill be determined by the extent to which we succeed inco-ordinating and combining the utilisation of our fundsand the development of the market, which we shall achieveby means of concessions agreements with capitalism; and this will result in an increase in agricultural production for us. 
 The result will depend upon which side makes thebest use of these resources. 
 I think that if the workingclass, which controls the most important branches of large-scale industry, concentrates on the key ones, it will gainmore than small industry, even if the latter does have a relatively faster growth. 
 The situation in our textile industry was such that at the end of 1920 there were obvioussigns of an improvement, but there was a shortage of fuel. 
Otherwise we should have obtained about 800 millionarshins * of cloth, and would have had materials of our own manufacture to exchange for farm products. 
 Owing to the fuel crisis, however, there has been an enormous drop in production. 
 Although we have succeededin purchasing coal abroad, and ships with this cargo willarrive in a week or two, we have nevertheless lost severalweeks or even months. 
 Every improvement in the state of large-scale production and the possibility of starting some large factories will strengthen the position of the proletariat to such an extentthat there will be no need to fear the petty-bourgeois ele-ment, even if it is growing. 
 We must not be afraid of thegrowth of the petty bourgeoisie and small capital. 
 Whatwe must fear is protracted starvation, want and food shortage, which create the danger that the proletariat will *Arshin is equal to 28 inches.

 be utterly exhausted and will give way to petty-bourgeois vacillation and despair. 
 This is a much more terrible prospect. 
 If output is increased the development of the petty bourgeoisie will not cause great harm, for theincreased output will stimulate the development of large-scale industry. 
 Hence, we must encourage small farming. 
It is our duty to do all we can to encourage small farming. 
The tax is one of the modest measures to be taken in this direction, but it is a measure that will undoubtedly provide such encouragement, and we certainly ought to adopt it.

C. 
P. 
 ON PARTY UNITY 1. 
 The Congress calls the attention of all members of the Party to the fact that the unity and cohesion of theranks of the Party, the guarantee of complete mutual con-fidence among Party members and genuine team-work that really embodies the unanimity of will of the vanguard ofthe proletariat, are particularly essential at the presenttime, when a number of circumstances are increasing thevacillation among the petty-bourgeois population of thecountry. 
 2. 
 Notwithstanding this, even before the general Party discussion on the trade unions, certain signs of factionalismhad been apparent in the Party—the formation of groupswith separate platforms, striving to a certain degree tosegregate and create their own group discipline. 
 Such symp-toms of factionalism were manifested, for example, at a Party conference in Moscow (November 1920) and at a Party conference in Kharkov, 74 by the so-called Workers’ Opposition group, and partly by the so-called DemocraticCentralism group. 
 All class-conscious workers must clearly realise that factionalism of any kind is harmful and impermissible, for no matter how members of individual groups may desire to safeguard Party unity, factionalism in practiceinevitably leads to the weakening of team-work and tointensified and repeated attempts by the enemies of thegoverning Party, who have wormed their way into it, towiden the cleavage and to use it for counter-revolutionary purposes. 
 The way the enemies of the proletariat take advantage of every deviation from a thoroughly consistent commu-nist line was perhaps most strikingly shown in the case of the Kronstadt mutiny, when the bourgeois counter-revolutionaries and whiteguards in all countries of the world immediately expressed their readiness to accept the slogansof the Soviet system, if only they might thereby secure theoverthrow of the dictatorship of the proletariat in Russia,and when the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the bourgeoiscounter-revolutionaries in general resorted in Kronstadt to slogans calling for an insurrection against the Soviet Government of Russia ostensibly in the interest of the Sovietpower. 
 These facts fully prove that the whiteguards strive,and are able, to disguise themselves as Communists, andeven as the most Left-wing Communists, solely for the pur-pose of weakening and destroying the bulwark of the pro-letarian revolution in Russia. 
 Menshevik leaflets distributed in Petrograd on the eve of the Kronstadt mutiny likewiseshow how the Mensheviks took advantage of the disagree-ments and certain rudiments of factionalism in the RussianCommunist Party actually in order to egg on and supportthe Kronstadt mutineers, the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the whiteguards, while claiming to be opponents of mutiny and supporters of the Soviet power, only with supposedlyslight modifications. 
 3. 
 In this question, propaganda should consist, on the one hand, in a comprehensive explanation of the harmful-ness and danger of factionalism from the standpoint of Party unity and of achieving unanimity of will among the vanguard of the proletariat as the fundamental con-dition for the success of the dictatorship of the proletariat;and, on the other hand, in an explanation of the peculiarfeatures of the latest tactical devices of the enemies of theSoviet power. 
 These enemies, having realised the hopeless-ness of counter-revolution under an openly whiteguard flag, are now doing their utmost to utilise the disagreementswithin the Russian Communist Party and to further thecounter-revolution in one way or another by transferringpower to a political group which is outwardly closest torecognition of the Soviet power. 
 Propaganda must also teach the lessons of preceding revolutions, in which the counter-revolution made a pointof supporting the opposition to the extreme revolutionary party which stood closest to the latter, in order to undermine and overthrow the revolutionary dictatorship and thus pave the way for the subsequent complete victory of the counter-revolution, of the capitalists and landowners. 
 4. 
 In the practical struggle against factionalism, every organisation of the Party must take strict measures toprevent all factional actions. 
 Criticism of the Party’s short-comings, which is absolutely necessary, must be conducted in such a way that every practical proposal shall be sub-mitted immediately, without any delay, in the most preciseform possible, for consideration and decision to the leadinglocal and central bodies of the Party. 
 Moreover, everycritic must see to it that the form of his criticism takesaccount of the position of the Party, surrounded as it is by a ring of enemies, and that the content of his criticism is such that, by directly participating in Soviet and Partywork, he can test the rectification of the errors of the Partyor of individual Party members in practice. 
 Analyses ofthe Party’s general line, estimates of its practical expe-rience, check-ups of the fulfilment of its decisions, studies of methods of rectifying errors, etc. 
, must under no cir-cumstances be submitted for preliminary discussion togroups formed on the basis of “platforms”, etc. 
, but mustin all cases be submitted for discussion directly to all themembers of the Party. 
 For this purpose, the Congress ordersa more regular publication of Diskussionny Listok 75 and special symposiums to promote unceasing efforts to ensure that criticism shall be concentrated on essentials and shallnot assume a form capable of assisting the class enemiesof the proletariat. 
 5. 
 Rejecting in principle the deviation towards syndical-ism and anarchism, which is examined in a special reso-lution, 76 and instructing the Central Committee to secure the complete elimination of all factionalism, the Congressat the same time declares that every practical proposalconcerning questions to which the so-called Workers’ Oppo-sition group, for example, has devoted special attention,such as purging the Party of non-proletarian and unreliable elements, combating bureaucratic practices, developing democracy and workers’ initiative, etc. 
, must be examinedwith the greatest care and tested in practice. 
 The Party must know that we have not taken all the necessary measures in regard to these questions because of various obstacles, but that, while ruthlessly rejecting impractical and factional pseudo-criticism, the Party will unceasingly continue—trying out new methods—to fight with all the means atits disposal against the evils of bureaucracy, for the exten-sion of democracy and initiative, for detecting, exposingand expelling from the Party elements that have wormed their way into its ranks, etc. 
 6. 
 The Congress, therefore, hereby declares dissolved and orders the immediate dissolution of all groups withoutexception formed on the basis of one platform or another(such as the Workers’ Opposition group, the DemocraticCentralism group, etc. 
). 
 Non-observance of this decision of the Congress shall entail unconditional and instant expulsion from the Party. 
 7. 
 In order to ensure strict discipline within the Party and in all Soviet work and to secure the maximum unanim-ity in eliminating all factionalism, the Congress author-ises the Central Committee, in cases of breach of discipline or of a revival or toleration of factionalism, to apply all Party penalties, including expulsion, and in regard tomembers of the Central Committee, reduction to the statusof alternate members and, as an extreme measure, expulsionfrom the Party. 
 A necessary condition for the applicationof such an extreme measure to members of the Central Committee, alternate members of the Central Committee and members of the Control Commission is the convocationof a Plenary Meeting of the Central Committee, to whichall alternate members of the Central Committee and allmembers of the Control Commission shall be invited. 
 Ifsuch a general assembly of the most responsible leaders of the Party deems it necessary by a two-thirds majority to reduce a member of the Central Committee to the statusof alternate member, or to expel him from the Party, thismeasure shall be put into effect immediately.

C. 
P. 
 ON THE SYNDICALIST AND ANARCHIST DEVIATION IN OUR PARTY 1. 
 A syndicalist and anarchist deviation has been defi-nitely revealed in our Party in the past few months. 
 It calls for the most resolute measures of ideological struggle and also for purging the Party and restoring its health. 
 2. 
 The said deviation is due partly to the influx into the Party of former Mensheviks, and also of workers andpeasants who have not yet fully assimilated the communistworld outlook. 
 Mainly, however, this deviation is due to the influence exercised upon the proletariat and on the Russian Communist Party by the petty-bourgeois element,which is exceptionally strong in our country, and whichinevitably engenders vacillation towards anarchism, par-ticularly at a time when the condition of the masses hasgreatly deteriorated as a consequence of the crop failure and the devastating effects of war, and when the demobi-lisation of the army numbering millions sets loose hundredsand hundreds of thousands of peasants and workers unableimmediately to find regular means of livelihood. 
 3. 
 The most theoretically complete and clearly defined expression of this deviation ( or: one of the most complete, etc. 
, expressions of this deviation) is the theses and other literary productions of the so-called Workers’ Oppositiongroup. 
 Sufficiently illustrative of this is, for example,the following thesis propounded by this group: “Theorganisation of the management of the national economyis the function of an All-Russia Congress of Producers organised in industrial unions which shall elect a central body to run the whole of the national economy of theRepublic. 
” The ideas at the bottom of this and numerous similar statements are radically wrong in theory, and represent a complete break with Marxism and communism, with the practical experience of all semi-proletarian revolutions andof the present proletarian revolution. 
 First, the concept “producer” combines proletarians with semi-proletarians and small commodity producers,thus radically departing from the fundamental concept of the class struggle and from the fundamental demand that a precise distinction be drawn between classes. 
 Secondly, the bidding for or flirtation with the non-Party masses, which is expressed in the above-quoted thesis,is an equally radical departure from Marxism. 
 Marxism teaches—and this tenet has not only been formally endorsed by the whole of the Communist Interna-tional in the decisions of the Second (1920) Congress ofthe Comintern on the role of the political party of theproletariat, but has also been confirmed in practice by ourrevolution—that only the political party of the workingclass, i. 
e. 
, the Communist Party, is capable of uniting, training and organising a vanguard of the proletariat and of the whole mass of the working people that alone will becapable of withstanding the inevitable petty-bourgeoisvacillations of this mass and the inevitable traditions andrelapses of narrow craft unionism or craft prejudices amongthe proletariat, and of guiding all the united activities of the whole of the proletariat, i. 
e. 
, of leading it politically, and through it, the whole mass of the working people. 
Without this the dictatorship of the proletariat is impossible. 
 The wrong understanding of the role of the Communist Party in its relation to the non-Party proletariat, and in therelation of the first and second factors to the whole mass of working people, is a radical theoretical departure from communism and a deviation towards syndicalism andanarchism, and this deviation permeates all the views ofthe Workers’ Opposition group. 
 4. 
 The Tenth Congress of the Russian Communist Party declares that it also regards as radically wrong all attempts on the part of the said group and of other persons to defend their fallacious views by referring to Paragraph 5 of theeconomic section of the Programme of the Russian Com-munist Party, which deals with the role of the trade unions. 
 This paragraph says that “the trade unions should even-tually arrive at a de facto concentration in their hands of the whole administration of the whole national economy, asa single economic entity” and that they will “ensure in thisway indissoluble ties between the central state administra-tion, the national economy and the broad masses of workingpeople”, “drawing” these masses “into direct economic management”. 
 This paragraph in the Programme of the Russian Commu-nist Party also says that a prerequisite for the state at whichthe trade unions “should eventually arrive” is the processwhereby they increasingly “divest themselves of the narrowcraft-union spirit” and embrace the majority “and even-tually all” of the working people. 
 Lastly, this paragraph in the Programme of the Russian Communist Party emphasises that “on the strength of thelaws of the R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
, and established practice, the tradeunions participate in all the local and central organs ofindustrial management”. 
 Instead of studying the practical experience of partici-pation in administration, and instead of developing thisexperience further, strictly in conformity with successesachieved and mistakes rectified, the syndicalists andanarchists advance as an immediate slogan “congresses or a congress of producers” “to elect” the organs of economic management. 
 Thus, the leading, educational and organising role of the Party in relation to the trade unions of the pro-letariat, and of the latter to the semi-petty-bourgeois andeven wholly petty-bourgeois masses of working people, iscompletely evaded and eliminated, and instead of con-tinuing and correcting the practical work of building new forms of economy already begun by the Soviet state, we get petty-bourgeois-anarchist disruption of this work, whichcan only lead to the triumph of the bourgeois counter-revolution. 
 5. 
 In addition to the theoretical fallacies and a radically wrong attitude towards the practical experience of economic organisation already begun by the Soviet government, the Congress of the Russian Communist Party discerns in theviews of this and similar groups and persons a gross political mistake and a direct political danger to the very existence of the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
 In a country like Russia, the overwhelming prepon-derance of the petty-bourgeois element and the devastation, impov-erishment, epidemics, crop failures, extreme want andhardship inevitably resulting from the war, engenderparticularly sharp vacillations in the temper of the petty-bourgeois and semi-proletarian masses. 
 First they incline towards a strengthening of the alliance between these masses and the proletariat, and then towards bourgeois restoration. 
The experience of all revolutions in the eighteenth, nine-teenth, and twentieth centuries shows most clearly andconvincingly that the only possible result of these vacil-lations—if the unity, strength and influence of the revolu-tionary vanguard of the proletariat is weakened in the slightest degree—will be the restoration of the power andproperty of the capitalists and landowners. 
 Hence, the views of the Workers’ Opposition and of like-minded elements are not only wrong in theory, but arean expression of petty-bourgeois and anarchist wavering in practice, and actually weaken the consistency of the leading line of the Communist Party and help the class enemiesof the proletarian revolution. 
 6. 
 In view of all this, the Congress of the R. 
C. 
P. 
, emphati-cally rejecting the said ideas, as being expressive of asyndicalist and anarchist deviation, deems it necessary: First, to wage an unswerving and systematic struggle against these ideas; Secondly, to recognise the propaganda of these ideas as being incompatible with membership of the R. 
C. 
P. 
 Instructing the C. 
C. 
 of the Party strictly to enforce these decisions, the Congress at the same time points out that special publications, symposiums, etc. 
, can and should provide space for a most comprehensive exchange ofopinion between Party members on all the questions hereinindicated. 
 Published according to the manuscript 10 REPORT ON PARTY UNITY AND THE ANARCHO -SYNDICALIST DEVIATION MARCH 1678 Comrades, I do not think there is any need to say a great deal on this question because the subjects on which an official pronouncement must now be made on behalf of the Party Congress, that is, on behalf of the whole Party, weretouched upon in all the questions discussed at the Congress. 
The resolution “On Unity” largely contains a characterisa-tion of the political situation. 
 You must have all read theprinted text of this resolution that has been distributed. 
 Point 7, which introduces an exceptional measure, namely, the right to expel a member from the Central Committeeby a two-thirds majority of a general meeting of membersof the C. 
C. 
, alternate members and members of the CentralControl Commission, is not for publication. 
 This measurewas repeatedly discussed at private conferences at which representatives of all shades expressed their opinions. 
 Let us hope, comrades, that it will not be necessary to applythis point; but it is necessary to have it, in view of thenew situation, when we are on the eve of a new and fairlysharp turn, and want to abolish all traces of separatism. 
 Let me now deal with the resolution on syndicalist and anarchist deviations. 
 It is the question touched upon in point 4 of the Congress agenda. 
 The definition of our atti-tude to certain trends, or deviations in thinking, is thepivot of the whole resolution. 
 By saying “deviations”, weemphasise that we do not as yet regard them as somethingthat has crystallised and is absolutely and fully defined, but merely as the beginning of a political trend of which the Party must give its appraisal. 
 Point 3 of the resolution onthe syndicalist and anarchist deviation, copies of which you all probably have, evidently contains a misprint (judging by the remarks, it has been noticed). 
 It should read: “illustrative of this is, for example, the following thesis of the Workers’ Opposition: ‘The organisation of the manage-ment of the national economy is the function of an All-Russia Congress of Producers organised in industrial unionswhich shall elect a central body to run the whole of thenational economy of the Republic. 
’” We have repeatedly discussed this point during the Congress, at restricted con-ferences as well as at the open general sessions of the Con-gress. 
 I think we have already made it clear that it is quiteimpossible to defend this point on the plea that Engels hadspoken of an association of producers, because it is quiteobvious, and an exact quotation of the appropriate passage will prove, that Engels was referring to a classless commu-nist society. 
 That is something we all take for grantedonce society is rid of classes, only the producers remain,without any division into workers and peasants. 
 And weknow perfectly well from all the works of Marx and Engelsthat they drew a very clear distinction between the period in which classes still exist and that in which they no longer do. 
 Marx and Engels used to ridicule the idea that classescould disappear before communism, and said that commu-nism alone meant their abolition. 
 79 The position is that we are the first to raise the question of abolishing classes in the practical plane, and that two main classes remain in this peasant country—the working class and the peasantry. 
 Alongside of them, however, arewhole groups left over from capitalism. 
 Our Programme definitely says that we are taking the first steps and shall have a number of transitional stages. 
But in the practical work of Soviet administration and in the whole history of the revolution we have constantly had graphic illustrations of the fact that it is wrong to givetheoretical definitions of the kind the opposition has givenin this case. 
 We know perfectly well that classes haveremained in our country and will remain for a long time tocome; and that in a country with a predominantly peasant population they are bound to remain for many, many years. 
 It will take us at least ten years to organise large-scaleindustry to produce a reserve and secure control of agri-culture. 
 This is the shortest period even if the technical conditions are exceptionally favourable. 
 But we know that our conditions are terribly unfavourable. 
 We have a plan for building up Russia on the basis of modern large-scaleindustry: it is the electrification plan drawn up by ourscientists. 
 The shortest period provided for in that planis ten years, and this is based on the assumption thatconditions will be something like normal. 
 But we know perfectly well that we do not have such conditions and it goes without saying that ten years is an extremely shortperiod for us. 
 We have reached the very core of the question:the situation is such that classes hostile to the proletariatwill remain, so that in practice we cannot now create thatwhich Engels spoke about. 
 There will be a dictatorship of the proletariat. 
 Then will come the classless society. 
 Marx and Engels sharply challenged those who tended to for-get class distinctions and spoke about producers, the people,or working people in general. 
 Anyone who has read Marxand Engels will recall that in all their works they ridiculethose who talk about producers, the people, working people in general. 
 There are no working people or workers in general; there are either small proprietors who own the means ofproduction, and whose mentality and habits are capital-istic—and they cannot be anything else—or wage-workerswith an altogether different cast of mind, wage-workersin large-scale industry, who stand in antagonistic contra-diction to the capitalists and are ranged in struggle against them. 
 We have approached this question after three years of struggle, with experience in the exercise of the politicalpower of the proletariat, and knowledge of the enormousdifficulties existing in the relationships between classes, which are still there, and with remnants of the bourgeoisie filling the cracks and crevices of our social fabric, andholding office in Soviet institutions. 
 In the circumstancesthe appearance of a platform containing the theses I haveread to you is a clear and obvious syndicalist-anarchistdeviation. 
 That is no exaggeration: I have carefully weighed my words. 
 A deviation is not yet a full-blown trend. 
 A deviation is something that can be rectified. 
 People havesomewhat strayed or are beginning to stray from the path, but can still be put right. 
 That, in my opinion, is what the Russian word uklon means. 
 It emphasises that there is nothing final in it as yet, and that the matter can be easily rectified; it shows a desire to sound a warning and to raisethe question on principle in all its scope. 
 If anyone has abetter word to express this idea, let us have it, by all means. 
I hope we shall not start arguing over words. 
 We are essen-tially examining this thesis as the main one, so as not to go chasing after a mass of similar ideas, of which the Workers’ Opposition group has a great many. 
 We will leaveour writers, and the leaders of this trend to go into the mat-ter, for at the end of the resolution we make a point of sayingthat special publications and symposiums can and shouldgive space to a more comprehensive exchange of opinion between Party members on all the questions indicated. 
 We cannot now afford to put off the question. 
 We are a partyfighting in acute difficulties. 
 We must say to ourselves:if our unity is to be more solid, we must condemn a definitedeviation. 
 Since it has come to light, it should be broughtout and discussed. 
 If a comprehensive discussion is neces-sary, let us have it, by all means; we have the men to give chapter and verse on every point, and if we find it relevantand necessary, we shall raise this question internationallyas well, for you all know and have just heard the delegateof the Communist International say in his report that thereis a certain Leftist deviation in the ranks of the interna-tional revolutionary working-class movement. 
 The deviation we are discussing is identical with the anarchist deviationof the German Communist Workers’ Party, the fight againstwhich was clearly revealed at the last Congress of the Com-munist International. 
 80 Some of the terms used there to qualify it were stronger than “deviation”. 
 You know that this is an international question. 
 That is why it would be wrong to have done with it by saying, “Let’s have no morediscussions. 
 Full stop. 
” But a theoretical discussion is onething, and the Party’s political line—a political struggle—is another. 
 We are not a debating society. 
 Of course, we areable to publish symposiums and special publications and will continue to do so but our first duty is to carry on the fight against great odds, and that needs unity. 
 If we are tohave proposals, like organising an “All-Russia Congress of Producers”, introduced into the political discussion and struggle, we shall be unable to march forward united and in step. 
 That is not the policy we have projected over the next few years. 
 It is a policy that would disrupt the Party’steam-work, for it is wrong not only in theory, but also in its incorrect definition of the relations between classes—the crucial element which was specified in the resolutionof the Second Congress of the Communist International, 81 and without which there is no Marxism. 
 The situation todayis such that the non-Party element is yielding to the petty-bourgeois vacillations which are inevitable in Russia’spresent economic condition. 
 We must remember that in somerespects the internal situation presents a greater dangerthan Denikin and Yudenich; and our unity must not be formal but must go deep down below the surface. 
 If we are to create this unity, a resolution like the one proposed isindispensable. 
 The next very important thing in my opinion is Point 4 of this resolution, which gives an interpretation of ourProgramme. 
 It is an authentic interpretation, that is, the author’s interpretation. 
 Its author is the Congress, and that is why it must give its interpretation in order to puta stop to all this wavering, and to the tricks that are some-times being played with our Programme, as if what itsays about the trade unions is what some people wouldlike it to say. 
 You have heard Comrade Ryazanov’s criticism of the Programme—let us thank the critic for his theo-retical researches. 
 You have heard Comrade Shlyapnikov’scriticism. 
 That is something we must not ignore. 
 I thinkthat here, in this resolution, we have exactly what we needjust now. 
 We must say on behalf of the Congress, whichendorses the Programme and which is the Party’s supreme organ: here is what we understand the Programme to mean. 
 This, I repeat, does not cut short theoretical discussion. 
Proposals to amend the Programme may be made; no onehas suggested that this should be prohibited. 
 We do notthink that our Programme is so perfect as not to requireany modification whatever; but just now we have no formal proposals, nor have we allocated any time for the exami-nation of this question. 
 If we read the Programme carefullywe shall find the following: “The trade unions ... should eventually arrive at a de facto concentration”, etc. 
 The words, “should eventually arrive at a de facto concentra-tion”, should be underlined. 
 And a few lines above that we read: “On the strength of the laws ... the trade unionsparticipate in all the local and central organs of industrialmanagement. 
” We know that it took decades to build upcapitalist industry, with the assistance of all the advancedcountries of the world. 
 Are we so childish as to think that we can complete this process so quickly at this time of dire distress and impoverishment, in a country with a mass ofpeasants, with workers in a minority, and a proletarian van-guard bleeding and in a state of prostration? We have noteven laid the main foundation, we have only begun to givean experimental definition of industrial management with the participation of the trade unions. 
 We know that want is the principal obstacle. 
 It is not true to say that we arenot enlisting the masses; on the contrary, we give sinceresupport to anyone among the mass of workers with theleast sign of talent, or ability. 
 All we need is for the con-ditions to ease off ever so little. 
 We need a year or two, at least, of relief from famine. 
 This is an insignificant period of time in terms of history but in our conditions it is a longone. 
 A year or two of relief from famine, with regular sup-plies of fuel to keep the factories running, and we shallreceive a hundred times more assistance from the workingclass, and far more talent will arise from its ranks than we now have. 
 No one has or can have any doubts about this. 
 The assistance is not forthcoming at present, but notbecause we do not want it. 
 In fact, we are doing all we canto get it. 
 No one can say that the government, the tradeunions, or the Party’s Central Committee have missed asingle opportunity to do so. 
 But we know that the want in the country is desperate, that there is hunger and poverty everywhere, and that this very often leads to passivity. 
Let us not be afraid to call a spade a spade: it is these calam-ities and evils that are hindering the rise of mass energy. 
In such a situation, when the statistics tell us that 60 percent of the members of management boards are workers, it is quite impossible to try to interpret the words in the Programme— “The trade union ... should eventually arrive at a de facto concentration”, etc. 
— à la Shlyapnikov. 
 An authentic interpretation of the Programme will enable us to combine the necessary tactical solidarity and unity with the necessary freedom of discussion, and this is emphasised at the end of the resolution. 
 What does it sayin essence? Point 6 reads: “In view of all this, the Congress of the R.

, emphati-cally rejecting the said ideas, as being expressive of asyndicalist and anarchist deviation, deems it necessary, first, to wage an unswerving and systematic struggle against these ideas; secondly, to recognise the propaganda of theseideas as being incompatible with membership of the R.

 “Instructing the C. 
C. 
 of the Party strictly to enforce these decisions, the Congress at the same time points outthat special publications, symposiums, etc. 
, can and should provide space for a most comprehensive exchange of opinion between Party members on all the questions hereinindicated. 
” Do you not see—you all who are agitators and propagan-dists in one way or another—the difference between thepropaganda of ideas within political parties engaged in struggle, and the exchange of opinion in special publications and symposiums? I am sure that everyone who takes thetrouble to understand this resolution will see the difference. 
And we hope that the representatives of this deviationwhom we-are taking into the Central Committee will treatthe decisions of the Party Congress as every class-conscious disciplined Party member does. 
 We hope that with their assistance we, in the Central Committee, shall look intothis matter, without creating a special situation. 
 We shallinvestigate and decide what it is that is going on in theParty—whether it is the propaganda of ideas within apolitical party engaged in struggle, or the exchange of opinion in special publications and symposiums. 
 There is the opportunity for anyone interested in a meticulous studyof quotations from Engels. 
 We have theoreticians who canalways give the Party useful advice. 
 That is necessary. 
We shall publish two or three big collections—that is use-ful and absolutely necessary. 
 But is this anything like the propaganda of ideas, or a conflict of platforms? How can these two things be confused? They will not be confusedby anyone who desires to understand our political situation. 
 Do not hinder our political work, especially in a diffi-cult situation, but go on with your scientific research. 
 We shall be very happy to see Comrade Shlyapnikov supple-ment his recent book on his experiences in the undergroundrevolutionary struggle with a second volume written in hisspare time over the next few months and analysing theconcept of “producer”. 
 But the present resolution will serveas our landmark. 
 We opened the widest and freest discus-sion. 
 The platform of the Workers’ Opposition was pub-lished in the central organ of the Party in 250,000 copies. 
We have weighed it up from all sides, we have electeddelegates on its basis, and finally we have convened thisCongress, which, summing up the political discussion, says:“The deviation has come to light, we shall not play hide-and-seek, but shall say openly: a deviation is a deviation and must be straightened out. 
 We shall straighten it out,and the discussion will be a theoretical one. 
” That is why I renew and support the proposal that we adopt both these resolutions, consolidate the unity of theParty, and give a correct definition to what should be dealt with by Party meetings, and what individuals—Marxists, Communists who want to help the Party by looking intotheoretical questions—are free to study in their spare time. 
(Applause . 
) 11 SUMMING -UP SPEECH ON PARTY UNITY AND THE ANARCHO -SYNDICALIST DEVIATION MARCH 16 Comrades, we have heard some incredibly harsh expres-sions here, and the harshest, I think, was the accusationthat our resolution is slanderous. 
 But some harsh expres-sions tend to expose themselves. 
 You have the resolution. 
 You know that we took two representatives of the Workers’ Opposition into the Central Committee and that we usedthe term “deviation”. 
 I emphasise the meaning of thisterm. 
 Neither Shlyapnikov nor Medvedyev proposed anyother. 
 The theses we have criticised here have been criti-cised by the representatives of all shades of opinion. 
 After this, how can one talk of slander? If we had ascribed to someone something which is not true there would havebeen some sense in this harsh expression. 
 As it is, it issimply a sign of irritation. 
 That is not a serious objection! I now come to the points that have been mentioned here. 
 It has been stated that the Democratic Centralism group was given unfair treatment. 
 You have followed the develop-ment of the agreement between groups and the exchange ofopinion on the question of the election to the Central Com-mittee brought up by the representatives of the DemocraticCentralism group. 
 You know that ever since the privateconference that was attended by the whole of the Workers’ Opposition group and a number of very prominent com-rades, representatives of all shades, I, for one, have publiclyurged that it would be desirable to have representatives ofthe Workers’ Opposition and Democratic Centralism groupson the Central Committee. 
 No one opposed this at theconference, which was attended by all the comrades of the Workers’ Opposition and representatives of all shades. 
 It is quite clear that the election of a representative of theDemocratic Centralism group as an alternate and not as a full member of the Central Committee was the result of a lengthy exchange of opinion, and an agreement arrived at among the groups. 
 It is captious to regard this as a sign of mistrust in or unfairness to the Democratic Centralismgroup. 
 We in the Central Committee have done everythingto emphasise our desire to be fair. 
 This is a fact that cannotbe obliterated. 
 It is cavilling to draw the conclusion thatsomeone has been unfairly treated. 
 Or take the argument of a comrade from the Democratic Centralism group that Point 7 of the resolution was superfluous because the CentralCommittee already had that right. 
 We propose that Point7 be withheld from publication because we hope it willnot be necessary to apply it; it is an extreme measure. 
 Butwhen the comrade from the Democratic Centralism group says: “The Rules give you this right”, 82 he shows that he does not know the Rules, and is ignorant of the principlesof centralism and democratic centralism. 
 No democracyor centralism would ever tolerate a Central Committeeelected at a Congress having the right to expel its members. 
(A voice: “Bypassing the Party. 
”) Particularly bypassing the Party. 
 The Congress elects the Central Committee, thereby expressing its supreme confidence and vesting leadershipin those whom it elects. 
 And our Party has never allowedthe Central Committee to have such a right in relation toits members. 
 This is an extreme measure that is beingadopted specially, in view of the dangerous situation. 
 A special meeting is called: the Central Committee, plus the alternate members, plus the Control Commission, allhaving the same right of vote. 
 Our Rules make no provisionfor such a body or plenum of 47 persons; and never hasanything like it been practised. 
 Hence, I repeat that thecomrades of the Democratic Centralism group know neither the Rules, nor the principles of centralism or democratic centralism. 
 It is an extreme measure. 
 I hope we shall nothave to apply it. 
 It merely shows that the Party will resortto what you have heard about in the event of disagreementswhich in one aspect verge on a split. 
 We are not children,we have gone through some hard times, we have seen splits and have survived them; we know what a trial they are, and are not afraid of giving the danger its proper name. 
 Have we had at previous congresses, even amidst the sharpest disagreements, situations which, in one aspect, verged on a split? No, we have not. 
 Do we have such a situa-tion now? Yes, we do. 
 This point has been made repeatedly. 
 Now, I think, these are disagreements we can combat. 
 It has also been said that unity is not created by such resolutions; that according to the resolution criticism mustbe expressed only through the medium of the gubernia com-mittee; that lack of confidence has been expressed in the comrades of the Workers’ Opposition and that this has hampered their presence on the Central Committee. 
 But allof this is not true either. 
 I explained from the very outsetwhy we had chosen the word “deviation”. 
 If you don’tlike the word, accept the resolution as a basis and send it upto the Presidium for possible modification. 
 If we find a milder term I would propose that it be substituted for the word “deviation”, and also that other parts be modified. 
We shall not object to that. 
 We cannot discuss such detailshere, of course. 
 Hand in the resolution to the Presidiumfor editing and toning down. 
 It is certainly impossible tocouch it in stronger terms—I agree with that. 
 But it is not true to say that the resolution means inciting one section of the Party against another. 
 I do not know the composition of the Workers’ Opposition group in Samara, I have not been there; but I am sure thatif any member of the Central Committee or delegate to theCongress of whatever shade of opinion—except the Workers’ Opposition—were to set out to prove at a meeting of the Samara organisation that there is no incitement in theresolution, but a call for unity and for winning over themajority of the members of the Workers’ Opposition, hewould certainly succeed. 
 When people here use the term“incitement” they forget about Point 5 of the resolution on unity, which notes the services of the Workers’ Opposi-tion. 
 Are these not set down alongside each other? On theone hand, there is the “guilty of a deviation”, and onthe other, Point 5 says: “The Congress at the same timedeclares that every practical proposal concerning questionsto which the so-called Workers’ Opposition group, for example, has devoted special attention, such as purging the Party of non-proletarian and unreliable elements, com-bating bureaucratic practices, developing democracy and workers’ initiative, etc. 
, must be examined with the great-est care”, etc. 
 Is that incitement? It is a recognition of services. 
 We say: On the one hand, in the discussion, you have shown a deviation which is politically dangerous,and even Comrade Medvedyev’s resolution 83 admits this, although his wording is different. 
 And then we go on to say:As for combating bureaucratic practices, we agree that weare not yet doing all that can be done. 
 That is recognition of services and not incitement! When a comrade from the Workers’ Opposition is taken into the Central Committee, it is an expression of comradelyconfidence. 
 And after this, anyone attending a meeting notinflamed with factional strife will hear it say that thereis no incitement in this, and that it is an expression of comradely confidence. 
 As for the extreme measure, it is a matter for the future: we are not resorting to it now, andare expressing our comradely confidence. 
 If you thinkthat we are wrong in theory, we can issue dozens of specialpublications on the subject. 
 And if there are any youngcomrades, in the Samara organisation, for example, who have anything new to say on this question, then let’s have it, Comrades Samarians! We shall publish a few of yourarticles. 
 Everyone will see the difference between speechesat a Congress and words being bandied outside it. 
 If youexamine the precise text of the resolution you will finda theoretical definition of principle, which is not offensive in the least. 
 Alongside of it is recognition of services in combating bureaucratic practices, a request for assistanceand, what is more, inclusion of the representatives of thisgroup in the Central Committee, which is the Party’s great-est expression of confidence. 
 Therefore, comrades, I movethat both resolutions be adopted, by a roll-call vote, and then sent on to the Presidium for revision and modifica-tion of the formulations. 
 As Comrade Shlyapnikov is amember of the Presidium, perhaps he will find a moreappropriate substitute for the word “deviation “. 
 As regards the notices of resignation, I move we adopt the following resolution: “The Congress calls upon all members of the dissolved Workers’ Opposition group to submit to Party discipline, binding them to remain at their posts, and rejectsComrade Shlyapnikov’s and all other resignations. 
” 84 12 REMARKS ON RYAZANOV’S AMENDMENT TO THE RESOLUTION ON PARTY UNITY MARCH 1685 I think that, regrettable as it may be, Comrade Ryaza-nov’s suggestion is impracticable. 
 We cannot deprive the Party and the members of the Central Committee of theright to appeal to the Party in the event of disagreementon fundamental issues. 
 I cannot imagine how we can dosuch a thing! The present Congress cannot in any way bindthe elections to the next Congress. 
 Supposing we are faced with a question like, say, the conclusion of the Brest peace? Can you guarantee that no such question will arise? No,you cannot. 
 In the circumstances, the elections may haveto be based on platforms. 
 ( Ryazanov : “On one question?”) Certainly. 
 But your resolution says: No elections accordingto platforms. 
 I do not think we have the power to prohibit this. 
 If we are united by our resolution on unity, and, of course, the development of the revolution, there will beno repetition of elections according to platforms. 
 The lessonwe have learned at this Congress will not be forgotten. 
 Butif the circumstances should give rise to fundamental disagree-ments, can we prohibit them from being brought before the judgement of the whole Party? No, we cannot! This is an excessive desire, which is impracticable, and I movethat we reject it. 
 13 SPEECH ON THE FUEL QUESTION MARCH 16 Allow me to take the floor to refer the fuel question to a commission. 
 The fuel crisis is undoubtedly one ofthe—if not the—most important issue in all our economicdevelopment. 
 But I ask myself: shall we be able to reach a final decision on such an important question on the basis of the report and co-report—the one setting forth the view of thePresidium of the Supreme Economic Council, which is to begiven by Comrade Rykov, and the other, criticising that poli-cy, Comrade Larin’s standpoint—without referring it to acommission and studying documents which explain the essence of the matter and help to find out whether the whole depends on flaws in the machinery, scandalous practices and crimes,or the weakness of the peasant economy and the peasanthorse, without which the supply of firewood is impossible?I ask myself: can we adopt a decision without a commis-sion? And I say that we cannot. 
 It would therefore be much better for us to elect an enlarged commission consisting mostly of comrades from the provinces, who are famil-iar with the fuel, and specifically the firewood, business,who have more than a book knowledge of it, and haveactually had experience in the line. 
 The commission wouldhear not only the rapporteurs but would summon a number of persons and see that the statements made by the rap-porteur and co-rapporteur are documented. 
 It will thenreport to the Central Committee, which will, on that basis,have to adopt a number of crucial decisions in that sphere. 
This procedure will yield much more productive and use-ful results than discussions at the Congress which could make us waste a whole day and eventually lead us up to no further than reference of the question to a commission. 
 14 PROPOSAL ON THE FUEL QUESTION MARCH 16 I move that we instruct the Central Timber Board immediately to confer with delegates to the Congress whohave practical experience in the work of fuel and firewoodenterprises, with the view of working out right away urgent measures, especially in floating. 
 15 SPEECH IN CLOSING THE CONGRESS MARCH 16 Comrades, we have concluded the work of the Party Congress, which has been meeting at an extremely importantmoment for the fate of our revolution. 
 The Civil War, coming in the wake of so many years of imperialist war, has so torn and dislocated this country, that its revival istaking place in incredibly difficult conditions. 
 Hence, weshould not be surprised that there is a resurgence of theelements of disintegration and decay and of petty-bour-geois and anarchistic elements. 
 One of the fundamental conditions for this is the extreme and unprecedented intensification of want and despair that has now grippedtens and hundreds of thousands, and possibly even largernumbers, of people who see no way out of this disastroussituation. 
 But we know, comrades, that this country has hadit even worse. 
 Without shutting our eyes to the danger, or entertaining any sort of false optimism, we say frankly to ourselves and our comrades that the danger is great, butwe have great trust in the solidarity of the vanguard ofthe proletariat. 
 We know that no other force but the class-conscious proletariat can unite the millions of scatteredsmall farmers, many of whom are suffering incredible hardships; no other force can unite them economically and politically against the exploiters. 
 We are convinced thatthis force has emerged from the experience of the struggle—the gruelling experience of the revolution—sufficientlysteeled to withstand all severe trials and the difficultiesthat lie ahead. 
 Comrades, apart from the decisions we have adopted on these lines, there is the exceptionally important decisionour Congress has adopted on relations with the peasantry. 
 In it we make a most sober appraisal of the relations between classes, and are not afraid openly to admit that this is a most difficult task, namely, that of establishing proper relations between the proletariat and the predomi-nating peasantry while normal relations are unfeasible. 
You can call relations normal only when the proletariathas control of large-scale industry and its products andfully satisfies the needs of the peasantry and, providing them with the means of subsistence, so alleviates their condition that there is a tangible and obvious improvement over thecapitalist system. 
 That is the only way to create a basisfor a normally functioning socialist society. 
 We cannotdo this at present because of the crushing ruin, want, im-poverishment and despair. 
 But to help to rid ourselves of this accursed legacy we are reacting in a definite way to the relations established during the disastrous war. 
 Wewill not conceal the fact that the peasantry have some verydeep grounds for dissatisfaction. 
 We shall explain the situa-tion more fully, and tell them that we shall do all we canto improve it and pay more heed to the small proprietor’s living conditions. 
 We must do everything to alleviate his condition, to give more to the small farmer, and assure him of greatersecurity in private farming. 
 We are not afraid of the anti-communist trend this measure is bound to produce. 
 Comrades, we have now been working for several years to lay, for the first time in history, the foundations of a social-ist society and a proletarian state, and it is in the spiritof sober appraisal of these relations that we have expressedour full readiness to reconsider this policy and even tomodify it. 
 I think that the results of our Congress in thisrespect will be all the more successful because we have been solidly united on this fundamental question from the very outset. 
 There was need for unanimity in the solution oftwo fundamental questions, and we have had no disagree-ments on the relations between the vanguard of the prole-tariat and its mass, and the relations between the proletariatand the peasantry In spite of the very difficult political conditions, we have been more united in our decisions on these points than ever before. 
 Permit me now to deal with two points, which I ask not to be entered into the minutes. 
 The first is the question of concessions in Baku and Grozny. 
 It was dealt with only in passing at this Congress. 
 I was unable to attend that session, but I have been told that some comrades have theirdoubts or have been left with a sense of dissatisfaction. 
I don’t think there are any grounds for this. 
 The CentralCommittee thrashed out this question of granting conces-sions in Grozny and Baku. 
 Several special commissions were set up and special reports from the departments concerned were called for. 
 There was some disagreement,several votes were taken, but after the last one not a singlemember or group in the Central Committee wished to exer-cise their incontestable right to appeal to the Congress. 
The new Central Committee will, I think, have full formal and actual right to decide this big question on the strength of a Congress decision. 
 Unless we grant concessions,we cannot hope to obtain the assistance of well-equippedmodern capitalist industry. 
 And unless we utilise the latter,we shall be unable to lay a proper foundation for our ownlarge-scale production in such industries as oil, which is of exceptional importance for the whole of the world economy. 
 We have not yet concluded a single concessionagreement, but we shall do all we can to do so. 
 Have youread in the newspapers about the opening of the Baku-Tiflis oil pipeline? There will soon be news of a similarpipeline to Batum. 
 This will give us an outlet to the world market. 
 We have to improve our economic posi-tion, and the technical equipment of our Republic, andgive our workers more food and goods. 
 Everything thathelps to ease things in this respect is of tremendous valueto us. 
 That is why we are not afraid of leasing parts ofGrozny and Baku. 
 By leasing out one-fourth of Grozny and one-fourth of Baku, we shall be able—if we succeed—to raise the rest of them to the modern technical level ofadvanced capitalism. 
 There is no other way for us to dothis at present. 
 Those who know the state of our economywill understand this. 
 But once we have a base, even if itcosts us hundreds of millions of gold rubles, we shall do everything to develop the rest. 
 The second question that I ask not to be published is the Presidium’s special decision concerning the manner /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR of reporting. 
 You know that at this Congress we have re-peatedly had to work in an atmosphere of excessive tension and a larger number of delegates were kept away from the sittings of the Congress than has usually been the case. 
We must, therefore, be more calm and thoughtful in draw-ing up a plan of how the reports are to be made in thelocalities, and we must be guided by a definite decision. 
Let me read you a comrade’s draft of the Presidium’s in-structions to the delegates returning home ( reads ). 
 86 I have summed it up, and I think these few lines are sufficient tocause every delegate to ponder over the question and inhis report to exercise the necessary caution, taking care notto exaggerate the danger of the situation or allow himselfor those around him to panic, whatever the circumstances. 
 Now that world capitalism has started its incredibly frenzied, hysterical campaign against us, it would beparticularly inappropriate for us to panic, and thereis no reason to do so. 
 Yesterday, by arrangement withComrade Chicherin, I received a summary of the newson this question, and I think you will find it instructive. 
 It is a summary of the news on the slander campaign about the situation in Russia. 
 The comrade who made the sum-mary writes: “Never before has the West-European pressindulged in such an orgy of lies or engaged in the massproduction of fantastic inventions about Soviet Russia asin the last fortnight. 
 Since the beginning of March, the whole of the West-European press has been daily pouring out torrents of fantastic reports about insurrections inRussia; a counter-revolutionary victory; Lenin and Trots-ky’s flight to the Crimea; the white flag over the Kremlin;barricades in Petrograd and Moscow and their streets runningwith blood; hordes of workers converging on Moscow from the hills to overthrow the Soviet government; Budyonny’s defection to the rebels; a counter-revolutionary victory ina number of Russian towns, a succession of names addingup to virtually all the gubernia capitals of Russia. 
 The scopeand method of the campaign betray it as a far-reaching planadopted by all the leading governments. 
 On March 2, the British Foreign Office announced through the Press Asso-ciation that it regarded these reports as improbable, but immediately thereafter issued its own bulletin about a rising in Petrograd, a bombardment of Petrograd by the Kronstadt fleet, and fighting in the streets of Moscow. 
 On March 2, all the British newspapers published cabled reports about uprisings in Petrograd and Moscow: Leninand Trotsky have fled to the Crimea; 14,000 workers inMoscow are demanding a constituent assembly; the Moscowarsenal and the Moscow-Kursk railway station are in thehands of the insurgent workers; in Petrograd, Vasilyevsky Ostrov is entirely in the hands of the insurgents. 
 Let me quote a few of the radio broadcasts and cables received on the following days: on March 3, Klyshko cabledfrom London that Reuter had picked up some absurd rumours about a rising in Petrograd and was assiduouslycirculating them. 
 March 6. 
 The Berlin correspondent Mayson cables to New York that workers from America are playing animportant part in the Petrograd revolution, and thatChicherin has radioed an order to General Hanecki to closethe frontier to émigrés from America. 
 March 6. 
 Zinoviev has fled to Oranienbaum; Red artillery is shelling the working-class quarter in Moscow; Petrograd is beleaguered (cable from Wiegand). 
 March 7. 
 Klyshko cables that according to reports from Revel, barricades have been erected in the streets of Moscow;the newspapers carry reports from Helsingfors that anti-Bolshevik troops have taken Chernigov. 
 March 7. 
 Petrograd and Moscow are in the hands of the insurgents; insurrection in Odessa; Semyonov advancingin Siberia at the head of 25,000 Cossacks; a RevolutionaryCommittee in Petrograd is in control of the fortificationsand the fleet (reported by the Poldhu wireless station inEngland). 
 Nauen, March 7. 
 The factory quarter in Petrograd is in revolt; an anti-Bolshevik insurrection has broken out inVolhynia. 
 Paris, March 7. 
 Petrograd in the hands of a Revolution-ary Committee; Le Matin 87 quotes reports from London saying the white flag is flying over the Kremlin. 
 Paris, March 8. 
 The rebels have captured Krasnaya Gorka; Red Army regiments have mutinied in Pskov Gubernia;the Bolsheviks are sending Bashkirs against Petrograd. 
 March 10. 
 Klyshko cables: the newspapers are asking whether Petrograd has fallen or not. 
 According to reports from Helsingfors three-quarters of Petrograd is in the hands of the insurgents. 
 Trotsky, or according to otherreports, Zinoviev is in command of operations and has hisheadquarters in Tosna, or else in the Peter and PaulFortress. 
 According to other reports, Brusilov has been ap-pointed Commander-in-Chief. 
 Reports from Riga say that Petrograd, except for the railway stations, was captured on the 9th; the Red Army has retreated to Gatchina; strik-ers in Petrograd have raised the slogan: “Down with theSoviets and the Communists. 
” The British War Office statesthat it is not yet known whether or not the Kronstadtrebels have joined up with the Petrograd rebels but, accord-ing to information at its disposal, Zinoviev is in the Peter and Paul Fortress, where he is in command of the Soviettroops. 
 Of a vast number of fabrications in this period I am taking only a few samples: Saratov has become an in-dependent anti-Bolshevik republic (Nauen, March 11). 
 Fierce anti-Communist riots in towns along the Volga (same source). 
 Fighting between Byelorussian detach-ments and the Red Army in Minsk Gubernia (same source). 
 Paris, March 15. 
 Le Matin reports that large numbers of Kuban and Don Cossacks are in revolt. 
 Nauen reported on March 14 that Budyonny’s cavalry has joined up with the rebels near Orel. 
 At various times insurrections were reported in Pskov, Odessa and other towns. 
 Krasin cabled on March 9 that the Washington cor-respondent of The Times said the Soviet regime was on its last legs and America was therefore deferring establish-ment of relations with the border states. 
 Reports at various times quoted American banking circles as saying that in the circumstances trade with Russia would be a gamble. 
 The New York correspondent of The Daily Chronicle reported as early as March 4 that business circles and theRepublican Party in America considered trade relationswith Russia at the present time to be a gamble. 
 This campaign of lies is being undoubtedly conducted not only with an eye to America, but also to the Turkishdelegation in London, and the plebiscite in Silesia. 
 Comrades, the picture is absolutely clear. 
 The world press syndicate—over there they have a free press, which means that 99 per cent of the press is in the pay of the financial magnates, who have command of hundreds ofmillions of rubles—has launched a world-wide campaignon behalf of the imperialists with the prime object of dis-rupting the negotiations for a trade agreement with Britain,which Krasin has initiated, and the forthcoming trade agreement with America, which, as I have stated, we have been negotiating here, and reference to which was madeat this Congress. 
 This shows that the enemies around us,no longer able to wage their war of intervention, are nowpinning their hopes on a rebellion. 
 And the Kronstadtevents revealed their connection with the international bourgeoisie. 
 Moreover, we see that what they fear most, from the practical angle of international capital, is theresumption of proper trade relations. 
 But they will failin their attempts to disrupt them. 
 There are some bigbusinessmen here in Moscow, and they have stoppedbelieving these false rumours. 
 They have told us that a group of citizens in America has used an original method of propaganda in favour of Soviet Russia. 
 It has collected the diverse press reports about Russia over the past few months—about the flight of Lenin andTrotsky, about Trotsky shooting Lenin, and vice versa—and has published them in a pamphlet. 
 You couldn’t find a better way of popularising the Soviet power. 
 Day after day they collected reports of the assassination of Lenin andTrotsky and showed how many times each had been shotor killed; such reports were repeated month after month. 
Finally, all these reports were collected in a pamphletand published. 
 The American bourgeois press has got a bad name for itself. 
 That is the enemy whom two million Rus-sian émigrés, landowners and capitalists, are serving; this isthe army of the bourgeoisie confronting us. 
 Let them try todisrupt trade relations and belittle the practical achievementsof the Soviet power. 
 We know that they will fail. 
 And thereports of the international press, which controls hundreds of thousands of newspapers and supplies news to the whole world, show once again how we are surrounded by enemiesand how much weaker they are as compared with last year. 
 That, comrades, is what we must understand. 
 I think that the majority of the delegates present here have realised just how far we can let our disagreements go. 
 It was natu-rally impossible to keep within these bounds during thestruggle at the Congress. 
 Men who have just emerged fromthe heat of battle cannot be expected to see these limitsall at once. 
 But we must have no doubts in our own mindwhen we look at our Party as the nucleus of the world revo-lution, and at the campaign which the world syndicate of states is now waging against us. 
 Let them wage their cam-paign. 
 We have sized it up, and we have exactly sized upour own disagreements. 
 We know that by closing our ranksat this Congress we shall emerge from our disagreementssolidly united, with the Party much stronger and marching with ever greater resolution towards international victo-ries! ( Stormy applause . 
) SPEEC H DELIVERED AT THE ALL-RUSSI A CONGRESS OF TRANSPOR T WORKERS MARC H 27, 192188 Comrades, may I thank you all for your greetings and ask you to accept my greetings to your Congress. 
 ( Stormy applause . 
) Allow me to digress before dealing with the subject that directly concerns the work and tasks of this Congress and what the Soviet state expects of it. 
 As I was coming in through your hall just now, I saw a placard with this inscription: “The reign of the workers and peasants will last for ever. 
” When I read this odd plac-ard, which, it is true, was not up in the usual place, but stood in a corner—perhaps it had occurred to someone thatit was not very apt and he had moved it out of the way—when I read this strange placard, I thought to myself:there you have some of the fundamental and elementarythings we are still confused about. 
 Indeed, if the reign of the workers and peasants would last for ever, we should never have socialism, for it implies the abolition of classes;and as long as there are workers and peasants, there willbe different classes and, therefore, no full socialism: Andas I pondered over the fact that three and a half years afterthe October Revolution we still have such odd placards (even if they are shifted out of the way) it occurred to me that there may still be great misunderstanding of themost common slogans in popular use. 
 Take one of our mostpopular slogans which we all variously repeat: we all singabout our present fight being the last and decisive one. 
But I am afraid that if we were to ask a large section of the Communists against whom they are now waging this last battle (not the last one, of course, that’s putting it on abit thick, but one of the last and crucial ones) I am afraid only a few would give the right answer showing a clear understanding against what, or whom, we are now waging one of our last and decisive battles. 
 It also seems to me that, in view of the political events which have caughtthe attention of the broad masses of workers and peasants,we ought once again to ascertain, or, at any rate, try toascertain, against whom we are waging one of our last andcrucial battles this spring, at this very moment. 
 Let me go over this point. 
 To sort it out we should, I think, start by reviewing as precisely and as soberly as possible, the opposed forceson whose struggle hinges the fate of the Soviet power, and,generally speaking, the course and development of theproletarian revolution, which is a revolution for the over-throw of the capitalists in Russia and elsewhere. 
 What are these forces? How are they grouped against one another?How are they deployed at present? Any marked aggravationof the political situation, every new turn in the politicalevents, even if it is not considerable, should always causeevery thinking worker and peasant to ask himself: “What are the forces involved? How are they grouped?” And only when we are able to estimate these forces correctly and quitesoberly, irrespective of our sympathies and desires, shallwe be able to draw the proper conclusions concerning ourpolicy in general, and our immediate tasks in particular. 
 Letme, therefore, give you a brief description of these forces. 
 There are basically three such forces. 
 Take first the pro-letariat, the force that is closest to us. 
 It is the first force,the first discrete class. 
 You all know this very well, livingin the very midst of it. 
 What is its condition now? In theSoviet Republic it is the class that took power three anda half years ago, that has, since then, been exercising its domination—dictatorship—and has suffered and endured exhaustion, want and privation more than any other class. 
To the working class, to the proletariat, this period,during the greater part of which the Soviet state wasengaged in a relentless civil war against the whole capi-talist world, brought calamities, privation, sacrifice and intense want on a scale unparalleled in world history. 
 A strange thing happened. 
 The class that took politicalpower did so in the knowledge that it was doing so alone. 
 That is intrinsic to the concept of the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
 It has meaning only when one class knows that it is taking political power alone, and does not deceive others or itself with talk about “popular government bypopular consent through universal suffrage”. 
 You all knowthat there are very many—far too many—people who loveto hold forth on that subject, but, at any rate, you willnot find them among proletarians, because they have real-ised that theirs is a dictatorship of the proletariat, and they say as much in their Constitution, the fundamentallaw of the Republic. 
 This class was well aware that it wastaking power alone, under extremely difficult conditions. 
It has exercised its political power as any dictatorship does,that is, with grim determination. 
 In these three and a half years, it has suffered distress, want, starvation and a worsening of economic positions such as no other class inhistory has suffered. 
 It is not surprising that as a resultof its superhuman effort it is uncommonly weary, exhaustedand strained. 
 How was a single class able to exercise its power in the teeth of the resistance and attacks of the world bourgeoi-sie, in a country where the proletariat is numerically somuch smaller than the rest of the population? How was itable to do that in a backward country artificially cut offby armed force from countries with a more numerous,class-conscious, disciplined and organised proletariat? How could it hold on for three and a half years? What was its mainstay? We know that it was the mass of the peasants,at home. 
 About this second force more in a moment, afterwe finish our examination of the first. 
 I have said that neverhas its suffering been so great and acute as in this epochof its dictatorship; and you all know it, having observed the life of your mates in the factories, railway depots, and workshops. 
 Never before has the country been so wearyand worn out. 
 Where did this class get the moral strengthto bear these privations? Clearly it had to draw on somesource for the moral strength to overcome these materialprivations. 
 As you know, the question of moral strength and support is a vague one; you can give any reading to moral strength. 
 To avoid the danger of reading anythingvague or fantastic into “moral strength”, I ask myself: Is there a precise definition of that which gave the prole-tariat the moral strength to bear the unprecedented material privations connected with its political rule? I think this will give us a precise answer. 
 Ask yourself: Could the SovietRepublic have borne its trials over three and a half years,and withstood the onslaught of the whiteguards supportedby the capitalists of the world, if it had had to face backwardinstead of advanced countries? You have only to put the question to see the obvious answer. 
 You know that for three and a half years the wealthiest powers of the world fought against us. 
 The armed forcesthat were ranged against us and that supported Kolchak,Yudenich, Denikin and Wrangel—you all know this verywell, for you all fought in the war—were immensely and clearly superior to our forces. 
 You know perfectly well that these states are still very much stronger than we are. 
How is it, then, that they set out to vanquish the Sovietpower, and failed? How did this happen? We have an exactanswer: the proletariat of all the capitalist countries wason our side. 
 Even when it was patently under the influence of the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries—in the European countries they go by another name—it refusedto support the fight against us. 
 Eventually, the leaderswere compelled to yield to the masses, and the workersdisrupted the war. 
 It was not we who won, for our armedforces were insignificant; the victory was won because the powers could not hurl the whole of their armed force against us. 
 The course of a war depends on the workers of theadvanced countries to such an extent that it cannot be wagedagainst their will, and their passive and semi-passive resist-ance eventually disrupted the war against us. 
 This incon-trovertible fact gives the exact answer to the question as to the source on which the Russian proletariat drew for moral strength to hold out for three and a half years and win. 
The moral strength of the Russian worker lay in his knowl-edge and awareness of the tangible assistance and supportwhich the proletariat of all the advanced countries ofEurope was giving him in this struggle. 
 The direction which the working-class movement in these countries is taking is indicated by this most important recent event:the split in the Socialist parties of Britain, France, Italy, and other countries (both vanquished and victors) which differ in cultural and economic development. 
 The main development of the year in all countries has been the for-mation of Communist Parties, with the support of all thatis most advanced in the working class, on the ruins of theSocialist and Social-Democratic parties—which in Russiaare called Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary. 
 And,of course, there can be no doubt that if we had been attacked by backward countries, without mighty proletarian masses, and not by advanced countries, we would have been unableto hold out for three and a half months, let alone three anda half years. 
 Would our proletariat have had the moralstrength if it had not relied on the sympathy of the workersof the advanced countries, who supported us in spite of the lies about the Soviet power circulated by the imperialists in millions of copies, and in spite of the efforts of the “labourleaders”—the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries—who could have been expected to, and did, hamper theworkers’ struggle for us? With this support, our prole-tariat—numerically weak and tormented by poverty and privation—won out because it had the moral strength. 
 That is the first force. 
The second is that which stands between developed capital and the proletariat. 
 It is the petty bourgeoisie, the smallproprietors, which in Russia constitute the overwhelmingmajority of the population—the peasantry. 
 They are mainly small proprietors and small farmers. 
 Nine-tenths of them are that way, and can be nothing else. 
 They do not takepart in the acute struggle daily waged by capital and labour. 
They have not been schooled; their economic and politicalconditions do not bring them together, but rather tend toseparate, alienating them from each other, and transform-ing them into millions of lone-wolf small proprietors. 
 Such are the facts and you are all perfectly well aware ofthem. 
 It will take collectives, collective farms and com-munes years to change this. 
 Thanks to the revolutionaryenergy and devotion of the proletarian dictatorship, thisforce was able to dispose of its enemies on the right—the landowner class—to sweep them right out and abolish their rule more swiftly than has ever been done before. 
 Butthe more quickly it abolished the rule of the landowners, the more quickly it turned to its farming on the nation-alised land, the more resolutely it settled accounts with the small minority of kulaks, the sooner it itself became transformed into small proprietors. 
 You know that therehas been a levelling-off in the Russian countryside in thisperiod. 
 The number of peasants with large areas undercrop and without any at all has decreased, while the num-ber of medium farms has increased. 
 The countryside has become more petty bourgeois. 
 This is an independent class, which, once the landowners and capitalists are expelledand eliminated, is the only class capable of opposing theproletariat. 
 That is why it is absurd to write on placardsthat the reign of the workers and peasants will last forever. 
 You know the political mood of this force. 
 It is a vacil-lating force. 
 We saw this to be true during our revolutionall over the country. 
 There were some local features inRussia proper, Siberia and the Ukraine, but the resultwas the same everywhere: it is a vacillating force. 
 Fora long time it was in the leading strings of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, with the aid of Kerensky, in the Kolchak period, under the Constituent Assemblyin Samara, when the Menshevik Maisky was a Ministerof Kolchak or of one of his predecessors, etc. 
 This forcewavered between the leadership of the proletariat andthat of the bourgeoisie. 
 Why didn’t it lead itself? After all, it is the overwhelming majority. 
 The fact is that the economic conditions of these masses are such that they areunable to organise and unite by their own efforts. 
 This isclear to anyone who is not misled by empty talk about“universal suffrage”, a constituent assembly and such like“democracy” which has served to dupe the people in all countries for hundreds of years and which the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks in our own country playedup for hundreds of weeks but fell through “on this veryspot every blessed time”. 
 ( Applause . 
) We know from our own experience—and revolutions all over the world confirmit if we take the modern epoch of, say, a hundred and fifty years—that the result has always been the same every-where: the petty bourgeoisie in general, and the peasantsin particular, have failed in all their attempts to realise their strength, and to direct economics and politics their own way. 
 They have had to follow the leadership either of the proletariat, or the capitalists—there is no middle way open to them. 
 Anyone who thinks of a middle way is anempty dreamer. 
 There is much politics, economics, and his-tory to prove it. 
 The teachings of Marx show that once thesmall proprietors-become owners of the means of productionand land, exchange between them necessarily gives rise to capital, and simultaneously to the antagonisms between capi-tal and labour. 
 The struggle between capital and the pro-letariat is inevitable; it is a law manifesting itself all overthe world. 
 This must be accepted by anyone-who refuses tofool himself. 
 These fundamental economic facts explain why this force cannot manifest itself through its own efforts, and why it has always failed in all its attempts to do so in thehistory of all revolutions. 
 Whenever the proletariat wasunable to lead the revolution, this force always followedthe leadership of the bourgeoisie. 
 That was the case in allrevolutions. 
 The Russians, of course, are of the same clay, and if they choose to pretend they are not, they will only look ridiculous. 
 History metes out the same treatmentto all. 
 We, in particular, saw the truth of this under therule of Kerensky. 
 At that time, the government hadthe support of very many more political leaders than theBolsheviks have. 
 They were clever, educated men, with vast experience in politics and state administration. 
 If we were to count all the officials who sabotaged us, butwho did not make it their business to sabotage the Kerenskygovernment, which relied on the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, we would find that they made up an over-whelming majority. 
 Still that government collapsed. 
 That shows that there were factors which offset the enormous preponderance of intellectual and educated forces accus-tomed to administering the state, an art they had acquireddecades before they actually took over. 
 Events ran thesame course, with some modifications, in the Ukraine,the Don and the Kuban regions, and the result was exactly the same. 
 That could not have been a coincidence. 
 Such is the economic and political law governing the second force:hence, either the leadership of the proletariat—a hard road, but one which can help it to escape the rule of the landowners and capitalists—or the leadership of the capi-talists, as it does in the advanced democratic republics, and even in America, where the free distribution of land (everysettler was allotted sixty dessiatines * free of charge— better conditions can hardly be imagined!) has not yetentirely stopped, and where this has led to the completedomination of capital. 
 That is the second force. 
 Over here it is wavering, and is particularly weary. 
 It has had to bear the burdens of the revolution, and inthe past few years fresh burdens have been thrust upon it:a year of crop failure, surplus-grain appropriations, withcattle dying off because of the fodder shortage, etc. 
 In the circumstances, it is not surprising that this second force— the masses of the peasantry—should give way to despair. 
They could not think of improving their condition althoughthree and a half years have passed since the landownerswere driven out, yet the improvement is becoming anurgent necessity. 
 The dispersing army fails to find proper employment for its labour-power, and so this petty-bourgeois force is being transformed into an anarchic element, whoserestiveness is an expression of its demands. 
 You are all familiar with the third force: the landowners and capitalists. 
 It is no longer conspicuous in this country. 
But one crucial event, one critical lesson of the past few weeks—the Kronstadt events—was like a flash of lightning which threw more of a glare upon reality than anything else. 
 There is now no country in Europe without some white-guard elements. 
 Russian émigrés in Europe have been esti-mated to total about seven hundred thousand. 
 These arefugitive capitalists and the mass of office workers who could not adapt themselves to Soviet rule. 
 We see nothing of this third force, it has emigrated, but it lives and operatesin alliance with the capitalists of the world, who are assist-ing it as they assisted Kolchak, Yudenich and Wrangel,with money and in other ways, because they have theirinternational bonds. 
 We all remember these people. 
 You must have noticed the abundance of extracts from the *about 160 acres. 
— Tr. 
 whiteguard press in our newspapers over the last few days, explaining the events in Kronstadt. 
 In the last few days, they have been described by Burtsev, who puts out a news-paper in Paris, and have been appraised by Milyukov—youmust have all read this. 
 Why have our newspapers devotedso much attention to it? Was it right to do so? It was,because we must have a clear view of our enemy. 
 Abroad,they are not so conspicuous, but you will find that they have not moved very far away, just a few thousand versts at most; and having moved that far, have taken cover. 
They are alive and kicking, and lying in wait. 
 That is whywe must keep a close watch on them, especially becausethey are more than just refugees. 
 Indeed, they are the agentsof world capital, who work with it hand in glove. 
 You must have noticed that these extracts from the whiteguard newspapers published abroad appeared side byside with extracts from British and French newspapers. 
They are one chorus, one orchestra. 
 It is true that suchorchestras are not conducted by a man with a score. 
 Inter-national capital uses less conspicuous means than a con-ductor’s baton, but that it is one orchestra should be clear from any one of these extracts. 
 They have admitted that ifthe slogan becomes “Soviet power without the Bolshe-viks” they will all accept it. 
 Milyukov explains this withparticular clarity. 
 He has made a close study of history,and has had a refresher course in Russian history at first hand. 
 He has supplemented his twenty years of book learn-ing with twenty months of personal experience: He says heis prepared to accept the “Soviet power without the Bol-sheviks” slogan. 
 He cannot see from over there in Pariswhether this is to be a slight shift to the right or to theleft, towards the anarchists. 
 From over there, he cannot see what is going on in Kronstadt, but asks the monarchists not to rush and spoil things by shouting about it. 
 Hedeclares that even if the shift is to be to the left, he is pre-pared to back the Soviet power against the Bolsheviks. 
 This is what Milyukov says, and it is absolutely right. 
 When he says that the Kronstadt events reveal an urge to set up a Soviet regime without the Bolsheviks, he shows that he has learned something from Russian history andfrom the landowners and capitalists. 
 It is a demand for a slight shift to the right, with a little bit of unrestricted trade, and a little bit of a constituent assembly—listen to any Menshevik, and you will hear it all, perhaps even without leaving this hall. 
 If the slogan of the Kronstadtevents is a slight deviation to the left—Soviet power withthe anarchists, begotten by distress, war, the demobilisa-tion of the army—why is Milyukov in favour of it? Becausehe knows that a deviation leads either to the proletarian dictatorship or to the capitalists. 
 Political power cannot exist in any other way. 
 Although we are not waging our last battle but one of the last anddecisive battles, the only correct answer to the question“Against whom shall we wage one of the decisive battlestoday?” is: “Against petty-bourgeois anarchy at home. 
” (Applause . 
) As for the landowners and capitalists, we beat them in the first campaign, but only in the first one: thesecond is to be waged on an international scale. 
 Moderncapitalism cannot fight against us, even if it were a hundredtimes stronger, because over there, in the advanced coun-tries, the workers disrupted its war yesterday and will disrupt it even more effectively today, because over there the consequences of the war are beginning to tell more andmore. 
 We have defeated the petty-bourgeois element at home,but it will make itself felt again. 
 And that is taken intoaccount by the landowners and the capitalists, particularlythe clever ones, like Milyukov, who has told the monarch-ists: “Sit still, keep quiet, otherwise you will only strength-en the Soviet power. 
” This has been proved by the generalcourse of the revolutions in which the toilers, with tempo-rary peasant support, set up short-lived dictatorships buthad no consolidated power, so that after a brief periodeverything tended to slip back. 
 This happened because the peasants, the toilers, the small proprietors, can have no policy of their own and must retreat after a period of vacil-lation. 
 That was the case in the Great French Revolution,and, on a smaller scale, in all revolutions. 
 And, of course,everyone has learned this lesson. 
 Our whiteguards crossedthe frontier, rode off a distance of three days’ journey, and, backed and supported by West-European capital, are lying in wait and watching. 
 Such is the situation. 
 It makes clearthe tasks and duties of the proletariat. 
 Weariness and exhaustion produce a certain mood, and sometimes lead to desperation. 
 As usual, this tends to breed anarchism among the revolutionary elements. 
 That was the case in all capitalist countries, and that is what is takingplace in our own country. 
 The petty-bourgeois element isin the grip of a crisis because it has had it hard over thepast few years; not as hard as the proletariat had it in1919, but hard, nevertheless. 
 The peasantry had to save the state by accepting the surplus-grain appropriations without remuneration, but it can no longer stand the strain. 
That is why there is confusion and vacillation in its midst,and this is being taken into account by the capitalist enemy,who says: “All it needs is a little push, and it will startsnowballing. 
” That is the meaning of the Kronstadt events in the light of the alignment of class forces in the whole of Russia and on the international scale. 
 That is the mean-ing of one of our last and crucial battles, for we have notbeaten this petty-bourgeois-anarchist element, and the imme-diate fate of the revolution now depends on whether or notwe succeed in doing so. 
 If we do not, we shall slide down as the French Revolution did. 
 This is inevitable, and we must not let ourselves be misled by phrases and excuses. 
We must do all we can to alleviate the position of thesemasses and safeguard the proletarian leadership. 
 If we dothis, the growing movement of the communist revolutionin Europe will be further reinforced. 
 What has not yet taken place there today, may well take place tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, but in world history such periods,as between today and tomorrow, mean no less than a fewyears. 
 That is my answer to the question as to what we are now fighting for, in one of our last and crucial battles. 
 That is my reading of recent events and the significance of the class struggle in Russia. 
 It is now clear why it has becomeso acute and why we find it so hard to see that the chiefenemy is not Yudenich, Kolchak or Denikin, but our ownconditions. 
 I can now go on to the concluding part of my speech (which is already too long), namely, the state of railway and water transport, and the tasks of the Railway andWater Transport Workers’ Congress. 
 I think that what I have had to describe here is very intimately bound up with these tasks. 
 There is hardly another section of the proletariat which comes so closely into contact with industry and agriculture in its everyday economic activity as therailway and water transport workers. 
 You must supply thecities with food, and revive the rural areas by carrying themanufactured goods to them. 
 That is clear to everyone, butit is much clearer to railway and water transport workers, because that is their everyday work. 
 And from this, I think, follow the exceptionally important tasks and the responsi-bility now falling to the railway and water transportworkers. 
 You all know that your Congress has been meeting just after some friction between the upper and the lower echelons of the union. 
 When this question was brought up at the last Party Congress, decisions were adopted to reconcilethem by subordinating the upper echelons to the lower,by rectifying the upper echelons’ mistakes, which I thinkwere of a minor nature but needed rectifying. 
 You knowthat the Party Congress rectified these mistakes, that the Congress closed on a note of greater solidarity and unity in the ranks of the Communist Party than before. 
 That is thelegitimate, necessary and only correct reply that the van-guard, i. 
e. 
, the leading section of the proletariat, can giveto the movement of the petty-bourgeois-anarchist element. 
If we class-conscious workers realise the danger of this movement, if we rally our forces, work much more harmo-niously and show a great deal more of solidarity, we shallmultiply our forces. 
 After our victory over the militaryattack, we shall conquer the vacillations and wavering ofthis element that is disturbing the whole of our everydaylife and for that reason is, I repeat, dangerous. 
 The deci-sions of the Party Congress, which rectified what was called to its attention, signify a great step forward in increasingthe solidarity and unity of the proletarian army. 
 YourCongress must do the same thing and implement the deci-sions of the Party Congress. 
 I repeat: the fate of the revolution depends more imme-diately upon the work of this section of the proletariat than upon any other. 
 We must restore the exchange betweenagriculture and industry, and we need a material basis to do so. 
 What is it? It is railway and water transport. 
 That is why it is your duty to dedicate yourselves to your work and this applies not only to those of you who are members of the Communist Party, and are therefore consciousvehicles of the proletarian dictatorship, but also to those ofyou who do not belong to the Party, but represent a trans-port workers trade union with a million, or a million anda half, members. 
 All of you, learning the lessons of our revo-lution and of all preceding revolutions, must understand the full gravity of the present situation. 
 If you do not allowyourselves to be blinded by all sorts of slogans, such as“Freedom”, “Constituent Assembly”, “Free Soviets”—it isso easy to switch labels that even Milyukov has turned upas a supporter of the Soviets of a Kronstadt republic—if you do not close your eyes to the alignment of class forces, you will acquire a sound and firm basis for all your politi-cal conclusions. 
 You will then see that we are passingthrough a period of crisis in which it depends on us whetherthe proletarian revolution continues to march to victoryas surely as before, or whether the vacillations and waver-ings lead to the victory of the whiteguards, which will not alleviate the situation, but will set Russia back from therevolution for many decades. 
 The only conclusion that you,representatives of railway and water transport workers,can and should draw is—let’s have much more proletariansolidarity and discipline. 
 Comrades, we must achieve this at all costs, and win.

 21, January 21, 1940 REPOR T ON THE TAX IN KIND DELIVERE D AT A MEETIN G OF SECRETARIES AND RESPONSIBL E REPRESENTATIVES OF R. 
C. 
P . 
(B. 
) CELL S OF MOSCOW AND MOSCO W GUBERNIA APRI L 9, 192190 Comrades, one hears the most varied and highly confusing opinions on the question of the tax in kind and the change in our food policy, and also on the Soviet government’seconomic policy. 
 Permit me, by arrangement with Com-rade Kamenev, to share our subjects in such a way that hewill give a detailed outline of the laws which have just been issued. 
 This will be all the more appropriate for he chaired the commission which was appointed by the Party’s CentralCommittee and later endorsed by the Council of People’sCommissars, and which drew up all the recent laws at anumber of conferences with representatives of the depart-ments concerned. 
 The last of these laws was issued yester-day, and we saw it in the newspapers this morning. 
 There is no doubt that each of these laws raises a number ofpractical questions, and it will take some work to familiar-ise all the local Party and Soviet workers with them andto devise the proper methods of applying them in thelocalities. 
 I should like to draw your attention to their general significance, or the principle behind them. 
 How are weto explain the fact that the Soviet government and thedictatorship of the proletariat are about to accept somefreedom of trade? To what extent can unrestricted trade andindividual enterprise be permitted side by side with the socialist economy? To what extent can we permit such a revival of capitalism, which may seem to be inevitablewith a free market, however restricted? What has called forth this change? What is its real meaning, character and significance? And how should members of the Commu-nist Party understand it? How is it to be explained, and what are the limits of its practical application? This,approximately, is the task I have set myself. 
 The first question is: what has called forth this change, which many think to be too drastic and not sufficientlyjustified? The fundamental and principal reason for the change is the extraordinarily acute crisis of peasant farming, andits very difficult condition, which has proved to be muchharder by the spring of 1921 than could have been expected. 
On the other hand, its consequences have affected therestoration of our transport system and of our industry. 
 I should like to point out that most mistakes on the question of substituting the tax in kind for the surplus-grain appro-priation system, and on the significance of the change, aremade because there is no effort to analyse the nature ofthe change and its implications. 
 Here is a picture of peasantfarming by the spring of 1921: an extremely severe crisis caused by the war-time ruin and aggravated by a disastrous crop failure and the resultant fodder shortage (for thefailure also affected the hay crop) and loss of cattle; andthe weakening of the productive forces of peasant farming,which in many places was doomed to utter ruin. 
 And herewe come to this question: what is the connection between this terribly acute crisis of peasant farming and the Soviet government’s abolition of the surplus-grain appropriationsystem? I say that if we are to understand this measure wemust ask ourselves: what is the transition we are making? In the event of a workers’ revolution in a country with a predominantly peasant population, with the factories, works and railways taken over by the working class, what, in essence, should be the economic relations between theworking class and the peasantry? They should obviously bethe following: the workers producing in the factories andworks, which now belong to them, all that is necessaryfor the country—and that means also for the peasants, who constitute the majority of the population—should transport all these things on their railroads and river vesselsand deliver them to the peasants, in return for the surplus agricultural produce. 
 This is absolutely obvious and hardly requires detailed explanation although it is constantly forgotten in the tax discussions. 
 But it should be borne in mind, because if we are to explain the significance of thetax in kind, which is only a transitional measure, we musthave a clear understanding of what we want to achieve. 
What I have said makes it clear that we do not want thepeasants’ products to be delivered to the workers’ state as appropriations of surplus grain, or a tax. 
 We want them in exchange for all the goods the peasants need delivered tothem by our transport system. 
 We must have such anarrangement. 
 It is a basis for the economy of a countrywhich has adopted socialism. 
 If peasant farming is todevelop, we must also assure its transition to the next stage which must inevitably be one of gradual amalgama-tion of the small, isolated peasant farms—the least profita-ble and most backward—into large-scale collective farms. 
That is how socialists have always visualised it, and that isexactly how our own Communist Party sees it. 
 I repeat,the greatest source of error and confusion is in appraising the tax in kind without making allowance for the specific features of the transitional measures which we must take,if we are to attain the goals which we can and must reach. 
 What, then, is the tax in kind? It is a measure in which we see something of the past and something of the future. 
A tax is something the state takes from the population without compensation. 
 If it is fixed at approximately one-half of last year’s rate of surplus-grain appropriations italone will not suffice for the workers’ state to maintainits Red Army, the whole of industry, and the whole of thenon-agricultural population, and to develop productionand relations with foreign countries, whose assistance in the way of machinery and equipment we need. 
 On the one hand, the workers’ state wants to rely on the tax at approxi-mately one-half the surplus-grain appropriations rate, andon the other, on the exchange of manufactured goods forthe surplus products of peasant farming. 
 Hence, the taxcontains a moiety of the old appropriation system and a moiety of that which is the only correct system, namely, the exchange of the manufactures of big socialist factoriesfor the products of peasant farming through the medium of food supply organisations of the working-class state and workers’ and peasants’ co-operative societies. 
 Why are we compelled to resort to a measure of which a moiety belongs to the past and a moiety only is put onproper lines? After all, we are not at all sure that we shallbe able to put it on proper lines at once, or that it will beat all considerable. 
 Why are we compelled to resort tosuch a half-measure? Why must we rely on such measures in our food and economic policy? What is it that makes it imperative? Everyone knows, of course, that it is not theSoviet government’s preference for some particular policy. 
It is the grinding need and the desperate situation. 
 Youknow that for several years after the victory of the work-ers’ revolution in Russia, after the imperialist war, we had to endure a civil war, and it is now no exaggeration to say that Russia suffered more than any other country in-volved in the imperialist war, including those which hadsuffered because it was fought on their territory. 
 For afterfour years of imperialist war we endured three years ofcivil war, which brought more havoc and industrial dis-location than any external war, because it was fought in the very heart of the country. 
 This terrible devastation isthe main reason why initially during the war—particularlywhen the Civil War cut us off from grain areas, like Siberia,the Caucasus and the whole of the Ukraine, and from oursupplies of coal and oil, and reduced our possibilities of obtaining other types of fuel—we could hold out—in a besieged fortress—only through the surplus-grain appropria-tion system, that is, by taking from the peasant whateversurplus produce was available, and sometimes even a partof his necessaries, in order to keep the army in fightingtrim and to prevent industry from going to pieces alto-gether. 
 During the Civil War, this problem was one of extraordinary difficulty, and was declared insoluble by allthe other parties. 
 Take the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, i. 
e. 
, the parties of the petty bourgeoisieand the kulaks. 
 At the most acute moments of the CivilWar they did the most shouting about the Bolsheviks’ having undertaken a crazy task, and the impossibility of holding out when all the powers were assisting the white-guards. 
 Indeed, the problem was one of exceptional diffi-culty, and called for a supreme effort. 
 It was successfully solved only because of what, you might say, was the super-human sacrifices on the part of the working class and the peasantry. 
 The working class never suffered such malnutri-tion, such starvation, as it did in the first years of its dicta-torship. 
 This naturally left as the only alternative theappropriation system, which meant taking from the peasantall of his surplus and a part of his necessaries. 
 He was told: “You, too, will have to go hungry for a while, but together we shall save our cause and drive off Denikin andWrangel. 
” That was the only conceivable solution. 
 This was not an economic system or an economic plan for a policy, adopted from a number of possible choices. 
 Thatwas not the case at all. 
 We could not think of restoring industry without ensuring a minimum of food and fuel. 
 Appropriation of surpluses without remuneration—becauseyou can’t call paper currency remuneration—was the onlyanswer to the task we set ourselves to preserve the remnantsof industry, to keep the workers from dispersing altogether,and to maintain the army. 
 We had no other way out. 
 That is what we are discarding, and I have already told you what we are adopting. 
 The tax is to help us make thetransition. 
 If it were possible to restore our industry faster,then perhaps, with a better harvest, we could make anearlier transition to the exchange of manufactured goodsfor agricultural products. 
 Many of you may remember that the question of switch-ing efforts to the economic front was raised at the NinthParty Congress. 
 At the time, all attention was focused onit. 
 We thought that we had finished with the war: afterall, we did offer bourgeois Poland incredibly favourablepeace terms. 
 But the peace was disrupted, and there fol-lowed the Polish war and its sequel—Wrangel, etc. 
 The period between the Ninth and the Tenth congresses wasalmost entirely a period of war. 
 You know that we signeda final peace treaty with the Poles only very recently;and a few days ago we signed a peace agreement withthe Turks, which alone will rid us of interminable wars in the Caucasus. 
 We have only now concluded a trade agree-ment with Britain, which is of world-wide significance. 
Only now has Britain been compelled to enter into commercial relations with us. 
 America, for example, still refuses to do so. 
 This will give you an idea of how hard it was for us to extricate ourselves from the war. 
 Had we been able to realise the anticipations of the Ninth Congressright away, we would, of course, have been able to providea much larger quantity of goods. 
 Today I had a visit from Comrade Korolyov of Ivanovo-Voznesensk, our most industrial, proletarian, Red gubernia. 
 He gave me some facts and figures. 
 In the first year only six factories were in operation, and not one ofthem ran for a month without stoppages. 
 Industry wasgrinding down to a standstill. 
 During the past year, 22factories were started for the first time, some running forseveral months, others up to half a year, without stop-pages. 
 The planned target was set at 150 million arshins, and according to the latest figures they produced 117million arshins, getting only half the fuel they had beenallocated. 
 That is how production plans were disrupted,not only in Ivanovo-Voznesensk, but all over Russia. 
 Thiswas due to a large extent to the decline of peasant farm-ing, to loss of cattle, and the impossibility of transporting a sufficient quantity of firewood to the railway stationsand river wharves, all of which gave Ivanovo-Voznesenskless firewood, less peat, and less oil than it should havehad. 
 The miracle is that, with only half the fuel they shouldhave got, they turned out 117 million arshins of the planned 150 million. 
 They increased the productivity of labour and transferred the workers to the best factories, obtaining ahigh percentage of output. 
 Here is a pretty good example,on our own doorstep, illustrating our position. 
 The NinthCongress fixed the textile target output at over 600 millionarshins, but we produced less than one-third of this because even Ivanovo-Voznesensk Gubernia, which proved to be the best, made only 117 million arshins. 
 Picture to your-selves Russia’s millions and these 117 million arshins ofcotton goods! This is poverty! The rehabilitation of indus-try lagged on such a scale that by the spring of 1921 itseemed to be quite hopeless. 
 We had to have a huge army, and it was built up to several millions. 
 Because of the dislocation of transport, it was very hard to demobilise itquickly in the winter. 
 We did it only by a supreme effort. 
 That was the situation we faced. 
 Was there any other way out but to cut food appropriations to the limit, taking 240 million poods of grain instead of 423 million? That is the least we must collect with a medium harvest, if weare to get by. 
 If we are to have more, we must give peasantfarming an opportunity to revive. 
 This requires somemeasures, and the best one, of course, would be to restorelarge-scale industry. 
 The best and the only economically correct measure would be to increase industrial output and give the peasant more of the things he needs, not onlycotton goods for the farmer and his family, but also badlyneeded machines and implements, even if they are of thesimplest kind. 
 But the metal industry was in the same stateas the textile industry. 
 That was the situation we faced. 
 We failed to restore industry after the Ninth Congress because we were hit by a year of war, fuel shortage, lack oftransport facilities, and the prostration of peasant farming. 
What can be done to give the utmost assistance to peasantfarming? Only a reduction of food appropriations and theirconversion into a tax of 240 million poods, given a medium harvest, and even less, if the harvest is bad. 
 The peasant must be sure that after paying a certain amount, fixed atthe minimum level, he will be absolutely free to grow asmuch as he can and use the rest of his products to get whathe needs and improve his farm not only with the help ofindustry, which would be the best and most rational way, but would take more resources than we now command. 
 The tax is fixed at the minimum, and its enforcement inthe localities will stimulate small industry, for we cannotset large-scale industry to rights as soon as we should like. 
This has been proved by the Ivanovo-Voznesensk programme,which yielded the largest portion of what we had planned for. 
 We must wait another year until fuel stocks are large enough to ensure the operation of all the factories. 
 Weshall be lucky to do it in a year, or even two. 
 Can we assurethe peasant of supplies? We can, if the harvest turns out tobe a good one. 
 When the question of the tax in kind was being decided at the Party Congress the delegates were given a pamphlet by Comrade Popov, Director of our Central Statistical Board,on grain output in Russia. 
 An enlarged edition will be published within a few days, and all of you should read it. 
 It gives an idea of grain production, with the figures calculated from the returns of our census, which gave us the exact figures of the population and an estimate of the sizeof farms. 
 It says that with a yield of 40 poods per dessiatine,peasant farming on Soviet Russia’s present area couldprovide 500 million poods of surplus grain that wouldcover the 350 million poods required by the urban popula-tion and leave us a fund for foreign trade and the improve-ment of peasant farming. 
 The harvest was so bad that theyield was no more than an average of twenty-eight poodsper dessiatine. 
 This produced a deficit. 
 If we accept thestatisticians’ figure of requirements at eighteen poods perhead, we must subtract three poods per head and oblige every peasant to go on short rations in order to keep the army and the industrial workers on half-rations. 
 In thatsituation, we could do nothing but reduce the surplusappropriations to a minimum and convert them into a tax. 
We must concentrate on improving small peasant farming. 
We had no cotton goods, machines or other goods produced by large factories to give the peasant farmers, but it is a problem requiring urgent solution, and we have to solve itwith the aid of small industry. 
 We should have some resultsfrom the new measure this very first year. 
 Now, why is peasant farming the focus? Because it alone can give us the food and the fuel we need. 
 If the working class, as the ruling class exercising its dictatorship, wants to run the economy properly, it must say: the crisis ofpeasant farming is the weakest spot. 
 It must be remedied,and another start made on the revival of large-scale in-dustry, 90 that in Ivanovo-Voznesensk district, for instance,all 70 factories—and not just 22—are running again. 
 These large factories will then satisfy national demand, and the working class will deliver the goods to the peasants inexchange for farm produce, instead of taking it in the formof a tax. 
 That is the transition we are making, and theprice is short rations all round, if we are to save those whoalone can keep what is left of industry and the railways going, and the army in the field to fight off the whiteguards. 
 Our grain appropriations-were maligned by the Menshe-viks, who said that the Soviet power had given the population nothing but grain appropriations, want and destruction. 
 They gloated over the fact that after the partial restoration of peace, after the end of the Civil War, the swift rehabilitation of our industry had proved to be impossible. 
But even the richest countries will take years to get theirindustry going full blast again. 
 Even a rich country likeFrance will take a long time to revive her industry, andshe did not suffer as much from the war as we did, because only a small part of her territory was devastated. 
 The aston-ishing thing is that in the first year of a partial peace wewere able to start 22 factories out of 70 in Ivanovo-Vozne-sensk, and to produce 117 million arshins of cotton goodsout of an anticipated 150 million. 
 The grain appropriationshad once been inevitable, but now we have had to change our food policy: we have had to switch from the surplus appropriation system to the tax. 
 This will undoubtedlyimprove the peasant’s condition, and give him an assuranceand a sense of certainty that he will be free to exchangeall his available grain surplus at least for local handicraftwares. 
 This explains why the Soviet government must conduct an economic policy on these lines. 
 Now, in conclusion, let me explain how this policy can be reconciled with the communist standpoint and how it hascome about that the communist Soviet power is promotinga free market. 
 Is it good from the standpoint of communism?To answer this question we must make a careful exami-nation of the changes that have taken place in peasant farm-ing. 
 First, we witnessed the assault of the whole of the peasan-try on the rule of the landowners, who were fought bothby the poor peasants and the kulaks, although, of course,their motives were different: the kulaks wanted to takethe land away from the landowners to develop their own farms. 
 That was when it became clear that the kulaks and the poor peasants had divergent interests and aims. 
 In theUkraine, this divergence of interests is still much more inevidence than it is over here. 
 The poor peasants could derivevery little direct benefit from the transfer of land fromthe landowners to themselves, because they had neither the materials nor the implements. 
 We find the poor peasants organising to prevent the kulaks from seizing the landtaken away from the landowners. 
 The Soviet government helped the Poor Peasants’ Committees that sprang up in Russia and in the Ukraine. 
91 As a result, the middle peas-ants have become the predominant element in the rural areas. 
 We know this from statistics, and everyone wholives in the country knows it from his own observations. 
The extremes of kulak and poor have been rounded off,and the majority of the population have come closer to thestatus of the middle peasant. 
 If we want to raise the produc-tivity of our peasant farming we must reckon chiefly with the middle peasant. 
 The Communist Party has had to shapeits policy accordingly. 
 Since the middle peasants now predominate in the rural areas, we must help them to improve their farming; more-over, we must make the same demands on them as we do on the workers. 
 The principal question discussed at the last Party Congress was that of food propaganda: con-centrate on the economic front, raise the productivity oflabour and increase output. 
 No progress is possible unlessthese tasks are fulfilled. 
 If we say this to the worker, wemust say as much to the peasant, but will demand in return that, after paying the tax, he should enlarge his farm, in the knowledge that no more will be exacted from him andthat he will be free to use the whole of his surplus to develophis farm. 
 Consequently, the change in policy in respect ofthe peasants is due to the change in their status. 
 There aremore middle peasants in the make-up of the rural areas and we must reckon with this, if we are to boost the productive forces. 
 Let me also remind you of the arguments I had with the “Left Communist” group in 1918, after the conclusion ofthe Brest-Litovsk peace. 
 92 Those who were in the Party at the time will remember that some Communists feared that the conclusion of the Brest Peace would disrupt all communist policy. 
 In the course of the argument with thesecomrades I said, among other things: State capitalism isnothing to fear in Russia; it would be a step forward. 
 Thatsounded very strange: How could state capitalism be a stepforward in a Soviet socialist republic? I replied: Take a close look at the actual economic relations in Russia. 
 We find at least five different economic systems, or structures,which, from bottom to top, are: first, the patriarchal economy, when the peasant farms produce only for their own needs, or are in a nomadic or semi-nomadic state, and we happen to have any number of these; second, small com-modity production, when goods are sold on the market; third,capitalist production, the emergence of capitalists, smallprivate capital; fourth, state capitalism, and fifth, socialism. 
And if we do take a close look we shall find all theserelations in Russia’s economic system even today. 
 In no circumstances must we forget what we have occasion to see very often, namely, the socialist attitude of workers atstate factories, who collect fuel, raw materials and food,or try to arrange a proper distribution of manufacturedgoods among the peasants and to deliver them with theirown transport facilities. 
 That is socialism. 
 But alongside is small enterprise, which very often exists independently of it. 
 Why can it do so? Because large-scale industry isnot back on its feet, and socialist factories are gettingperhaps only one-tenth of what they should be getting. 
 Inconsequence, small enterprise remains independent of thesocialist factories. 
 The incredible havoc, the shortage of fuel, raw materials and transport facilities allow small enterprise to exist separately from socialism. 
 I ask you:What is state capitalism in these circumstances? It isthe amalgamation of small-scale production. 
 Capital amal-gamates small enterprises and grows out of them. 
 It isno use closing our eyes to this fact. 
 Of course, a free market means a growth of capitalism; there’s no getting away from the fact. 
 And anyone who tries to do so will be delud-ing himself. 
 Capitalism will emerge wherever there is smallenterprise and free exchange. 
 But are we to be afraid ofit, if we have control of the factories, transport and foreigntrade? Let me repeat what I said then: I believe it to be incontrovertible that we need have no fear of this capitalism. 
 Concessions are that kind of capitalism. 
 We have been trying hard to conclude concession agree-ments, but, unfortunately, have not yet concluded a singleone. 
 Nevertheless, we are nearer to them now than wewere several months ago, when we last discussed concessions. 
 What are concessions from the standpoint of economic relations? They are state capitalism. 
 The Soviet govern-ment concludes an agreement with a capitalist. 
 Under it, the latter is provided with certain things: raw materials, mines, oilfields, minerals, or, as was the case in one of the last proposals, even a special factory (the ball-bearing project of a Swedish enterprise). 
 The socialist state givesthe capitalist its means of production such as factories,mines and materials. 
 The capitalist operates as a contractor leasing socialist means of production, making a profit onhis capital and delivering a part of his output to the socialist state. 
 Why is it that we badly need such an arrangement? Because it gives us, all at once, a greater volume of goodswhich we need but cannot produce ourselves. 
 That is howwe get state capitalism. 
 Should it scare us? No, it shouldnot, because it is up to us to determine the extent of the concessions. 
 Take oil concessions. 
 They will give us millions of poods of paraffin oil right away, and that is more thanwe produce ourselves. 
 This is to our advantage, because inexchange for the paraffin oil—and not paper money—thepeasant will give us his grain surplus, and we shall im-mediately be able to improve the situation in the whole country. 
 That is why the capitalism that is bound to grow out of a free market holds no terrors for us. 
 It will be theresult of growing trade, the exchange of manufactured goods,even if produced by small industry, for agricultural produce. 
 Today’s law tells you that workers in some industries are to be issued a certain part of the articles manufactured in their factories in the form of a bonus in kind which they can exchange for grain. 
 For example, provided they satisfythe requirements of the state, textile workers will receivea part of the textile goods they manufacture and will beable to exchange them for grain. 
 This must be done toimprove the condition of the workers and of the peasants as soon as possible. 
 We cannot do this on a nation-wide scale, but it must be done at all costs. 
 That is why we donot shut our eyes to the fact that a free market entails somedevelopment of capitalism, and we say: This capitalismwill be under the control and surveillance of the state. 
We need have no fear of it because the workers’ state has taken possession of the factories and railways. 
 It will help to stimulate the economic exchange of peasant producefor the manufactures of neighbouring craftsmen, who will satisfy some, if not all, of the peasants’ requirements in manufactured goods. 
 The peasant economy will improve, and that is something we need to do desperately. 
 Let small industry grow to some extent and let state capitalism de-velop—the Soviet power need have no fear of that. 
 We mustface the facts squarely and call a spade a spade, but we mustalso control and determine the limits of this development. 
 Concessions are nothing to be afraid of. 
 There is nothing terrible about giving the concessionaires a few factories and retaining the bulk in our own hands. 
 Of course, itwould be absurd for the Soviet power to hand out the bulkof its property in the form of concessions. 
 That would notbe concessions, but a return to capitalism. 
 There is nothingto fear in concessions so long as we retain possession of all the state enterprises and weigh up exactly and strictly the concessions we grant, and the terms and scale on whichwe grant them. 
 Growing capitalism will be under controland supervision, while political power will remain in thehands of the working class and of the workers’ state. 
 Thecapital which will exist in the form of concessions and the capital which will inevitably grow through the medium of the co-operatives and a free market, have no terrors forus. 
 We must try to develop and improve the condition ofthe peasantry, and make a great effort to have this benefitthe working class. 
 We shall be able to do all that can bedone to improve peasant farming and develop local trade more quickly with concessions than without them, while planning our national economy for a much faster rehabili-tation of large-scale socialist industry. 
 We shall be ableto do this more quickly with the help of a rested andrecuperated peasant economy than with the absolutelypoverty-stricken peasant farming we have had up to now. 
 That is what I have to say on the communist appreciation of this policy, on why it was necessary, and why, if properlyapplied, it will bring improvement immediately, or, at allevents, more quickly than if it had not been applied. 
 Pravda Nos. 
 81, 82 and 83, Published according April 15, 16 and 17, 1921 to the Pravda text MESSAG E OF GREETINGS TO THE CONFERENC E OF REPRESENTATIVES OF WOMEN’ S DEPARTMENTS OF THE PEOPLE S OF SOVIE T REGIONS AND REPUBLIC S IN THE EAST93 I deeply regret that I am unable to attend your conference because of the pressure of work. 
 Please accept my heartfelt greetings and best wishes of success in your work, partic-ularly in preparing for the forthcoming First All-RussiaNon-Party Congress of Women of the East, which, correctlyprepared and conducted, must greatly help the cause of awakening the women of the East and uniting themorganisationally. 
 Lenin Pravda No. 
 77, April 10, 1921 Published according to the Pravda text collated with the original signed by Lenin REPOR T ON CONCESSIONS AT A MEETIN G OF THE COMMUNIS T GROUP OF THE ALL-RUSSI A CENTRA L COUNCIL OF TRAD E UNIONS APRIL 11, 192194 Comrades, the concessions question has, rather unex-pectedly, brought out some differences among us, for it appeared to have been finally settled in principle as long ago as the autumn of last year, and when the Council ofPeople’s Commissars issued its concessions decree on No-vember 23, there was no sign of protest, or of any disagree-ment, in Party circles, among the responsible workers, atany rate. 
 You are, of course, aware that the Party Congress had to take a special decision confirming the concessions decree and specifically extending it to cover any conces-sions in Baku and Grozny. 
 95 This had to be done at the Party Congress to prevent any vacillation on policy in the CentralCommittee, whose division on this very question has tosome extent proved to be quite out of line with earlier group-ings, but which is largely connected with Baku. 
 Some Baku comrades resented the idea that Baku too—or, perhaps,specifically—is to have concessions, and that it is desirable tolease out a major part of its oilfields. 
 Their arguments werehighly diverse, and ranged from references to their own“exploration”, which could be done without any foreigners, to assertions that the old workers, who spent a lifetime fighting the capitalists, refuse to be saddled with their yokeonce again, etc. 
 I am not going to say offhand how much of these argu-ments was based on general principles and how much onBaku “patriotism” and localism. 
 Let me say for my part that I have opposed this view most vigorously in the belief that if we do not manage to conduct a concessions policyand attract foreign capital to our concessions, we can hardly consider any serious practical measures to improve our economic position. 
 We cannot seriously entertain the idea of an immediate improvement of the economic situation, unless we operate a policy of concessions, unless we discardour prejudices, our local patriotism, discard to some extentour craft patriotism, and to some extent the idea that wecan do our own “exploring”. 
 We must be prepared forinconveniences, hardships and sacrifices; we must be ready to break our habits and possibly our addictions as well, for the sole purpose of working a marked change and improve-ment in the economic state of the key industries. 
 Thismust be done at all costs. 
 The Party Congress concentrated on the policy in respect of the peasants and on the tax in kind, which has, in general, a high legislative priority and is, in particular, central to the Party’s political efforts. 
 In the context of both theseissues, we have become aware that we are unable to boostproductivity in large-scale industry as swiftly as the satis-faction of peasant needs demands, without the makeshiftsof unrestricted trade and free production. 
 These are the two crutches we must now use to move on, for, otherwise, as everyone in his right mind will see, we shall be unableto keep abreast of developments. 
 After all, the situationis worsening, if only because the floating this spring hasbeen largely hampered by various factors, chiefly theweather. 
 There is a looming fuel crisis. 
 The spring also holds out the threat of another crop failure, again because of the weather; this is liable to create a fodder shortage, which may,in its turn, still further reduce the fuel supply. 
 If on top ofthis we happen to have a drought, the crisis threatens to betruly exceptional. 
 We must understand that in these con-ditions what the Programme says—chiefly about the great need to increase the food supply—is not intended for admi-ration or for a show of great love for various resolutions(which the Communists have been doing with great zeal),but as a call to increase the quantity of foodstuffs at anycost. 
 That is something we cannot do without the help offoreign capital. 
 This should be plain to everyone who takes a realistic view of things. 
 That is why the concessions question became important enough to be dealt with bythe Party Congress. 
 After a short debate, the Council of People’s Commissars adopted the basic principles of concessions agreements. 
96 I shall now read them and underscore those which are ofespecial importance or have given rise to disagreements. 
We cannot seriously entertain the idea of economicdevelopment unless all members of the Party, specially theleaders of the trade union movement, that is, of the organisedmasses of the proletariat—its organised majority—under-stand the present situation and draw the appropriate conclu-sions. 
 I shall read out the basic principles of the concessionsagreement one by one, as they were adopted by the Councilof People’s Commissars. 
 Let me add that we have not yetconcluded a single concessions agreement. 
 We have alreadygiven expression to our disagreements of principle—we are past masters at that sort of thing—but have not yet secured any concessions. 
 I suppose this will make some peoplehappy, which is unfortunate, because if we fail to attractcapital to our concessions, we shall merely prove that weare poor businessmen. 
 But then, of course, the Communistscan always have a field day with resolutions, filling up all the stocks of paper that we have. 
 Here is Point One: “1. 
 The concessionaire shall improve the condition of the workers employed at the concession enterprises (as comparedwith that of other workers employed at similar enterprisesin the area) up to the average standard abroad. 
” We have inserted this basic provision in the agreement to bring out the gist of the matter at once for our Communists and chiefs of economic agencies. 
 What is the most importantaspect of any concession? It is, of course, an increase inthe quantity of goods. 
 That is self-evident. 
 But what isalso highly—if not much more—important is that we cansecure an immediate improvement in the condition of the workers employed at the oil concession enterprises. 
 These provisions of the concession agreement were adopted afterseveral discussions, in particular, on the basis of the talksthe plenipotentiaries of the R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
, specifically ComradeKrasin, have had with some of the financial magnates ofmodern imperialism. 
 Let me say—and you are of course all aware of this—that the great majority of our Communists have a book knowledge of capitalism and finance capital;they may even have written a pamphlet or two on the subject, but 99 per cent of them don’t know how to do business with financial magnates and, I’m afraid, will never learn. 
 In that respect, Comrade Krasin has had some exceptional experience, for he has made a study of the practices andorganisation of industry in Germany and Russia. 
 We in-formed him of these terms, and he replied that they were,on the whole, acceptable. 
 The concessionaire is above allduty bound to improve the condition of the workers. 
 This very point was discussed by Krasin in his exploratory talks with an oil king, and the West-European capitalistswere quite clear on the point that, the condition of the work-ers being what it is, it was absolutely impossible to expectgreater productivity. 
 The proviso that the concessionairemust improve the workers’ condition is not a humanitarian but a purely business proposition. 
 Point Two: “2. 
 Account shall be taken of the lower productivity of the Russian worker and provision made for the possibilityof a revision of the Russian worker’s rate of labour produc-tivity, depending on the improvement of his livingconditions. 
 ” We had to make this reservation to prevent a one-sided reading of the clause. 
 All these provisions are rules anddirectives for any representatives of the Soviet power whomay have to deal with the concessions, and are the basis onwhich the agreements are to be worked out. 
 We have draftsof an oil agreement, an agreement on ball-bearing plants, a draft timber concession, and an agreement on Kamchatka, which is being aired for a long time but is not being imple-mented for various reasons. 
 Point Two was required toprevent a literal reading of Point One. 
 We must consider thefact that labour productivity will not rise until the workers’condition improves. 
 Refusal to consider this would be so unbusiness-like that the capitalist would not even bother to negotiate. 
 Point Three: “3. 
 It shall be the duty of the concessionaire to supply the workers employed at the concession enterprises withthe necessary means of subsistence from abroad, sellingthem to the workers at no higher than cost price plus a certain percentage for overhead expenses. 
” There was a proposal to set the figure at 10 per cent, but it was discarded in the final discussion. 
 The important thing here is that we stipulate the supply of the means of subsistence for the workers from abroad. 
 We know that with the present state of peasant farming and the fuel problem we shall be unable, within the next few years, toeffect a radical improvement in the workers’ condition, and,consequently, to increase labour productivity. 
 It is, there-fore, necessary for the concessionaire to include in theagreement a provision covering the supply of all the means of consumption from abroad, something he can easily do, and we already have the tentative consent of some capi-talist sharks on this point. 
 The concessionaires will acceptthese terms because they are extremely anxious to obtainthe tremendously valuable raw materials. 
 For them thesupply of raw materials is a prime necessity. 
 Whether these priority enterprises will be employing 10,000, 20,000 or 30,000 workers, the concessionaires will have no trouble inobtaining the necessaries for the workers, considering theties between modern syndicates and trusts, for very fewcapitalists today are not syndicated and trustified, and alllarge enterprises are based on monopoly, instead of the free market; consequently, they can always block supplies of raw materials and foodstuffs for other capitalists and obtainall they require under all manner of provisional agreements. 
These syndicates operate with hundreds of millions ofdollars. 
 They will have vast stocks of food at their disposal,and will, consequently, be able to obtain foodstuffs and other necessaries for several tens of thousands of workers, and transport them to Russia. 
 They will not find it an economic problem at all. 
 They will regard these enterprises as being on the priority list—they will make a profit of 100, if not 1,000, per cent—andsupply them with food. 
 I repeat, that will be no economic problem for them at all. 
 We must put at the heart of our concessions policy the task of improving the conditionof the workers at the enterprises of the first category, andthen at the rest. 
 Here is Point Four: “4. 
 It shall also be the duty of the concessionaire, in the event of a request on the part of the R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
 Government, to import another 50 -100 per cent over and above the sup-plies he brings in for the workers employed at the conces-sion enterprises, handing it over to the R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
 Govern-ment in return for a payment of similar size (cost plus a certain percentage for overhead expenses). 
 The R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
 Government shall have the right to meet this payment with a part of the product extracted by the concessionaire(that is, to deduct it from its own share). 
” This stipulation was also accepted by the financial magnates in the exploratory talks because they put theconcession enterprises on the priority list. 
 They will be in a position to monopolise the marketing of the oil which they can obtain from us, and this is whythey can supply foodstuffs not only to the workers employedat their enterprises but also a certain percentage over andabove that. 
 A comparison of this clause with Point Oneshows that the pivot of our concessions policy is improve-ment of the condition of the workers, initially of those employed at the concession enterprises, and then, to asomewhat lesser extent, of the other workers as well, withsome of the consumer goods being obtained from abroad. 
Even if we had the wherewithal to pay for them, we our-selves are not in a position to purchase them in the interna-tional market. 
 You may have the currency, say, gold, but you must bear in mind that there is no free market, for itis all, or nearly all, controlled by the syndicates, cartelsand trusts, which are ruled by their imperialist profits. 
They will supply consumer goods only to workers of theirown enterprises, and not for those of others, because the old capitalism—meaning the free market—is no longer there. 
 That shows the essence of our concessions policyin the context of the present conditions of finance capitaland the behemoth struggle between the trusts. 
 The conces-sions policy is an alliance concluded by one side againstanother, and so long as we are not strong enough, we must play off their hostile rivalry, so as to hold out until the victory of the international revolution. 
 They can assurethe workers of their maintenance because it is no troubleat all for a large modern enterprise to supply an extra20,000 or 30,000 workers. 
 This would allow us to meet theexpenditure with raw materials, say, oil. 
 If we were able to pay for this additional quantity of necessaries for the workers with an additional quantity of timber or ore—ourchief resources—we should be in a position to start by improving the condition of the workers employed at the concession enterprises and use what is left to improve, to a lesser extent, the condition of other workers. 
 Point Five: “5. 
 It shall be the duty of the concessionaire to abide by the laws of the R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
, in particular, those relatingto working conditions, terms of payment, etc. 
; and enterinto agreements with the trade unions (in the event of the concessionaire’s demand we are prepared to add that under such agreements both parties shall be bound by the averagenorm of American or West-European workers). 
” This reservation is being made to remove any fears the capitalists may have in respect of our trade unions. 
 We saythat agreements must be entered into with our trade unions because their participation is stipulated by all the relevant laws—all essential laws stipulate the participation of tradeunions which enjoy statutory status in accordance withsocialist principles. 
 The well-informed capitalist is awarethat the trade unions are guided by Communist groupsand, through them, by the Party, and he would be highly suspicious if we told him that he would have to enter into agreements with our trade unions, because he would beapprehensive of all sorts of absurdities on the part of theseCommunists, and would, in consequence, make the mostincredible demands. 
 Such fears are quite natural from thecapitalist standpoint. 
 That is why we must say that we favour a business agreement—otherwise there is nothing to discuss. 
 That is why we say we are prepared to make thataddendum. 
 We are prepared to accept, for ourselves and ourtrade unions, a norm equal to the average American or West-European labour norm. 
 Otherwise, I repeat, there can beno question at all of any agreement adapted to capitalist relations. 
 Point Six: “6. 
 It shall be the duty of the concessionaire strictly to observe the scientific and technical regulations inconformity with Russian and foreign legislation (details tobe stated in each agreement). 
” This point is to be elaborated in the agreement in par-ticular detail. 
 The oil agreement, for instance, contains 10 clauses setting forth and describing detailed scientificregulations. 
 Inability to attend to the proper scientific exploitation of labour-power, as of the land, is the hallmark of capitalist economic operations. 
 Scientific and technical regulations are a way of overcoming it. 
 Incorrect or insuf-ficiently correct working of oilfields is known to resultin their flooding. 
 It is clearly very important for us toobtain the technical equipment. 
 You will recall that The Plan for the Electrification of Russia estimated just how much of that equipment we needed. 
 I do not remember the exact figure, but the overall expenditures for electrification were estimated at 17,000 million gold rubles, with thepriority projects taking about a decade to fulfil. 
 We expectto cover up to 11,000 million from our own resources—goldand exports—which leaves 6,000 million outstanding. 
 Theauthors of the plan say that we shall either have to borrow or lease. 
 The deficit has to be made good. 
 The plan was worked out for the whole Republic by the best brains and providesfor a balanced development of all branches of industry. 
The chief problem is fuel and its most economic, rationaland efficient use in the key industries. 
 We should be unableto solve it if we did not have any concessions or credit facilities. 
 These conditions may suddenly turn out to be non-existent, and that at the most welcome moment, say,after a large strike, like the one now on in Britain, orthe one which was recently defeated in Germany. 
 97 But a successful strike and a successful revolution will come inthe wake of an unsuccessful one, and we shall then find ourselves with socialist, instead of capitalist, relations. 
 Stoppages in oil extraction may prove to be disastrous. 
 The capitalists have failed to reach Baku’s 1905 rate. 
 Itturns out that the danger of flooding is also reckoned withabroad, for instance, in California and Rumania. 
 Insuffi-cient pump-off of water results in ever greater flooding. 
 There are detailed regulations on this score in Russian and foreign legislation. 
 When dealing with this matter inBaku, we sought the opinion of our experts on Rumanianand Californian legislation. 
 If we are to safeguard our oilresources, we must see that the scientific and technicalregulations are observed. 
 If we are to lease, say, a tract of forest we must see that the lumbering is done in a proper manner. 
 If it should be an oil lease, we must stipulatemeasures to prevent flooding. 
 In each case, there must be /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR observance of scientific and technical regulations and ra-tional exploitation. 
 Where are the regulations to come from? They are to be taken from Russian and foreign legislation, and this will allay any suspicions that they are our owninvention, in which case no capitalist will bother to nego-tiate with us. 
 We intend to take what there is in Russianand foreign legislation. 
 If we take the best of what thereis in Russian and any foreign legislation, we shall have a basis to guarantee the standards attained by the leading capitalists. 
 These are well-known business standards bor-rowed from capitalist practice, and not a Communist flightof fancy which the capitalists fear most of all. 
 We guaranteethat none of the terms, aspects or clauses of our concessionagreement will go beyond the framework of capitalist legislation. 
 We must never lose sight of this key proposi-tion. 
 We must take capitalist relationships as a basis toshow that the capitalists will find these terms acceptableand profitable, but we, for our part, must turn them to goodadvantage. 
 Otherwise, it is a waste of time to talk aboutconcessions. 
 But to return to what is recognised in capitalist legislation. 
 Advanced capitalism is known to be superior to our own industry in technical organisation and improve-ments. 
 For that reason, we are not confining ourselvesto Russian legislation, and in the case of oil we have startedto borrow from Russian, Rumanian and Californian legisla-tion. 
 We are entitled to take any law, which will dispel any suspicions of arbitrariness or whim. 
 That will be easily understood by the modern advanced capitalist and financialmagnate, in fact, finance capital as a whole, for our termsand standards will conform to those prevalent abroad, andwe are proposing them with an eye to the business practicesof capitalism. 
 In this case, we are not indulging in any flights of fancy, but are setting ourselves the practical goal of improving our industry and raising it to the levels ofmodern advanced capitalism. 
 Anyone who has an idea ofthe state of our industry will see that this will be a tremen-dous improvement. 
 If we were to do this even in respectof a certain section of our industry, say, one-tenth of it, we should still be taking a great step forward, which would be feasible for them, and highly desirable for us. 
 PointSeven: “7. 
 A rule similar to that set forth in Point Four shall also apply to the equipment imported by the concessionaire from abroad. 
” Point Four says that the concessionaire shall be bound, in the event the clause is written into the agreement, toimport a certain quantity of goods for sale, against a specialpayment, over and above what he imports for his own oper-ations. 
 If the capitalist should import improved types of bores and tools for himself, we shall be entitled to demand that he import, say, an extra 25 per cent for us, over andabove the bores he imports for himself, the payment arrange-ments to be the same as those specified in Point Four,that is, cost plus a definite percentage for overheadexpenses. 
 The future is very bright, but we should never confuse our activity in these two planes: on the one hand, there isthe agitation which brings nearer this future, and on theother, the ability now to adapt ourselves to and exist inthe capitalist encirclement. 
 If we fail to do that we mightfind ourselves in the position of one who has had his chance but was not alert enough to act in time. 
 We must manage, by taking advantage of the peculiarities of the capitalistworld and the capitalist avidity for raw materials, to deriveall the benefits that would help us to consolidate oureconomic positions among the capitalists, strange as thatmay sound. 
 The task seems to be an odd one: How can a socialist republic improve its positions with capitalist support? We had an instance of this during the war. 
 Wedid not win the war because we were stronger, but be-cause, while being weaker, we played off the enmity betweenthe capitalist states. 
 Either we now succeed in playing offthe rivalry between the trusts, or we shall find ourselves unadapted to capitalist conditions and unable to exist in the capitalist encirclement. 
 Point Eight: “8. 
 A special clause in each agreement shall regulate the question of payment to the workers employed at theconcession enterprises of wages in foreign currency specialcoupons, Soviet currency, etc. 
” You see that in this case we are prepared to accept pay-ment in any currency, whether foreign or Soviet, or incoupons, and show goodwill by being prepared to consider any of the businessmen’s proposals. 
 Of the concrete propos-als there is the one Vanderlip made to our representatives. 
 He said: “I should like to pay the workers an average wage of, say, a dollar and a half a day. 
 On my concession territoryI would set up stores carrying all the goods the workers mayneed, and these will be available to those who receive spe-cial coupons; these coupons will be issued only to workerswho are employed at my concession enterprises. 
” Whether things work out as he says, remains to be seen, but we find this acceptable in principle. 
 A great many difficultiesnaturally arise. 
 It is, of course, no easy task to harmonise aconcession geared to capitalist production with the Sovietstandpoint, and every effort of that kind is, as I have said,a continuation of the struggle between capitalism and socialism. 
 This struggle has assumed new forms, but it remains a struggle nonetheless. 
 Every concessionaire remainsa capitalist, and he will try to trip up the Sovietpower, while we, for our part, must try to make use of hisrapacity. 
 We say: “We shall not grudge him even 150 percent in profits, provided the condition of our workers is improved. 
” That is the pivot of the struggle. 
 In this sphere, of course, you need to be even more skilled than in strugglingfor the conclusion of a peace treaty. 
 The capitalist powersbehind the scenes take part in the struggle for the conclusionof any peace treaty. 
 There was a foreign power pulling thestrings behind each of the countries with whom we have signed a peace treaty—Latvia, Finland and Poland. 
 We had to conclude these treaties in such a way that, on theone hand, they allowed the bourgeois republics to exist,and on the other, they secured advantages for the Sovietpower from the standpoint of world diplomacy. 
 Every peacetreaty with a capitalist power is a record of certain war clauses. 
 In much the same way, each clause of a concession agreement records some aspect of a war, and we shouldorganise things in such a way as to safeguard our owninterests in that war. 
 This can be done because the capitalistwill be receiving big profits from the concession enterprise,while we shall be obtaining some improvement in the condition of our workers, and some increase in the quantity of goods from our share in the output. 
 If the wages shouldbe paid in foreign currency, this will give rise to a number of complex problems: how is this currency to be exchanged for Soviet currency? how are we to fight speculation? etc. 
 We have accepted the idea that we have an answer to all these problems, and need not fear any of them. 
 This pointtells the capitalists that they are free to invent anythingthey like. 
 It makes no difference to us whether you bringin the goods and sell them for special coupons, on specialterms, or only upon presentation of special certificates issued personally to workers employed at the concession. 
 We shall manage to adapt ourselves to any terms in sucha way as to fight the capitalists on these terms and securea certain improvement in the condition of our workers. 
This is the task we have set ourselves. 
 We can’t tell how itwill be resolved in a concession agreement, for we can’t very well offer the same terms of payment in some place like Kamchatka as over here or in Baku. 
 If the concession shouldbe located in the Donets Basin, the forms of payment cannotconceivably be the same as for one in the far North. 
 Weare not holding down the capitalists to some specific formof payment. 
 Every clause of the agreement will contain an element of struggle between capitalists and socialists. 
 We are not afraid of this struggle, and are sure that we shallmanage to derive every possible benefit from the conces-sions. 
 Point Nine: “9. 
 The concessionaire shall be free to make his own terms of employment, living conditions and remuneration with foreign skilled workers and employees. 
 “The trade unions shall not have the right to demand application of Russian pay rates or of Russian rules ofemployment to that category of workers. 
” We believed Point Nine to be absolutely indispensable because it would be quite absurd to expect the capitalists to trust the Communists. 
 This is clearly stated both from the standpoint of principle and especially from the businessman’sstandpoint. 
 For if we insisted on trade union endorsement ofthese terms of employment, if we told the capitalists that weaccepted any foreign technician or specialist but only withinthe framework of the Labour Code of the R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
, it would be too much to expect any of the latter to accept, and the demand would be a mere formality. 
 It could be said that thegovernment says one thing and the trade unions another, because they are two distinct bodies, thereby leaving a legal loophole. 
 But this was not written for lawyers but for Communists, and it was done on the basis of the decisions of the Tenth Party Congress on how to conduct the concessionspolicy. 
 All of our writings, to which people in Europe haveaccess, say that the concessions policy is being directed bythe Communist Party, which is the ruling party. 
 This hasbeen rendered into all foreign languages, and there is no catch in it. 
 We would not be in a position to consider any concessions policy at all, if we, being the political leader-ship, failed to say that in this case we were unable andunwilling to make use of our influence with the tradeunions. 
 There is no sense in teaching communism to the capi-talists. 
 We are fine Communists, but we are not going to usher in the communist order through concessions. 
 After all, a concession is an agreement with a capitalistpower. 
 We would surely have committed to a lunaticasylum any Communist who decided to go and conclude atreaty with a capitalist power on the basis of communistprinciples. 
 We would tell him that he was a fine Communist in his way but a complete flop as a diplomatist in a capi-talist country. 
 The Communist who tried to demonstratehis communism in respect of the concessions policy in anagreement would be just as near to being committed toa lunatic asylum. 
 What you need to have is a good idea ofcapitalist trade, and if you haven’t got it, you’re no good. 
 Either don’t go in for concessions at all, or make an effort to understand that we must try to use these capitalistconditions in our own interest, by allowing the foreigntechnicians and workers complete freedom. 
 That we shallnot insist on any restrictions in this sphere goes withoutsaying. 
 Section Three of Point Nine, which follows, does contain a restriction: “The proportion of foreign workers and employees to Russians, both in total and within the several categories,shall be agreed upon by the parties in concluding eachconcession agreement separately. 
” We cannot, of course, object to the importation of foreign workers into areas which we are unable to supply withRussian workers, as, for instance, in the Kamchatka timber industry. 
 In the case of, say, the mining industry, where there is a lack of drinking water or foodstuffs, and where the capitalists would wish to build, we shall also allow them to bring in the greater part. 
 On the other hand, where Russianworkers are available, we stipulate a proportion to giveour workers a chance, a) to learn, and b) to improve theircondition. 
 After all, we do want our workers to benefitfrom an improvement of our enterprises according to the last word in capitalist technology. 
 The capitalists have not raised any objections in principle to any of these pro-visions. 
 And here is Point Ten, the last one: “10. 
 The concessionaire may, by agreement with the government organs of the R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
, be granted the rightto invite highly skilled specialists from among Russian citizens, the terms of employment being agreed with central government bodies in each case. 
” Plainly, we cannot guarantee full scope in this respect, as we can in respect of foreign technicians and workers. 
In the latter case, we refrain from interfering, and they areleft entirely within the framework of capitalist relations. 
 We promise no such scope for our specialists and techni-cians, for we cannot have our best men working at theconcession enterprises. 
 We have no desire to shut off all accessfor them to that area, but there must be supervision overthe performance of the agreement from above and from below. 
The workers, members of the Communist Party, who will be employed at these enterprises, must supervise the performance of the terms of the agreement, both in respectof their technical training and observance of our laws. 
There were no objections in principle on this point in theexploratory talks with some of the magnates of moderncapitalism. 
 All these points have been confirmed by the Council of People’s Commissars, and I hope they give you a clearpicture of the concessions policy we intend to conduct. 
 Each concession will undoubtedly be a new kind of war— an economic war—the fight carried into another plane. 
This calls for adaptation, but one that is in line with the Party Congress. 
 If we are to attain our goal, we must have a respite and must be prepared to make sacrifices and endurehardships. 
 Our goal is: in the capitalist encirclement to make use of the greed of the capitalists for profit and the rivalry between the trusts, so as to create conditions for the existence of the socialist republic, which cannot exist without having ties with the rest of the world, and must, inthe present circumstances, adjust its existence to capital-ist relations. 
 There is the question of actual terms. 
 Foroil agreements, they are as follows: from one-quarter toone-third of the whole of Grozny and of the whole of Baku. 
 We have worked out our share of the output: we shall be retaining from 30 to 40 per cent of the oil extracted. 
 Wehave inserted a commitment to increase output within acertain period to, say, 100 million, and another commit-ment to extend the oil pipeline from Grozny and Petrovskto Moscow. 
 Whether we shall have to make any extra pay-ments is to be stipulated in each agreement. 
 But we should be quite clear on the type of agreement concluded in theseconditions. 
 The important thing, from the trade unionstandpoint, is for the Party leadership to see the specificfeatures of this policy and set themselves the task of securingsuch concessions at any cost, in pursuance of the decisions of the Party Congress, in the context of tasks facing the socialist system in the capitalist encirclement. 
 Everyconcession will be a gain and an immediate improvementin the condition of a section of the workers and peasants. 
The latter will stand to gain because each concession willmean the production of additional goods, which we are unable to produce ourselves, and which we shall be exchang-ing for their products, instead of taking them through a tax. 
 This is a very difficult operation, especially for the or-gans of the Soviet power. 
 With this point as pivotal wemust set about to secure concessions, overriding the preju-dices, inertia, ingrained customs, and the inconvenience of some workers having a bigger pay packet than the others. 
 We could invent any number of excuses, in the way ofobjections and inconveniences, to frustrate any practicalimprovement, and that is what the foreign capitalists arereally banking on. 
 I know of no other point that has drawnso many objections from the most intelligent writers in the Russian whiteguard press, the men the Kronstadt events proved to be head and shoulders above Martov and Chernov. 
They are very well aware that if we fail to improve the condition of our workers and peasants because of our preju-dices, we shall multiply our difficulties and altogether undermine the prestige of the Soviet power. 
 You know that we must have that improvement at all costs. 
 We shall notgrudge the foreign capitalist even a 2,000 per cent profit,provided we improve the condition of the workers andpeasants. 
 It is imperative that we do it. 
 First published in 1932 Published according to the verbatim report TO THE COMRADES COMMUNISTS OF AZERBAIJAN, GEORGIA, ARMENIA, DAGHESTAN, AND THE MOUNTAINEER REPUBLIC I send my warmest greetings to the Soviet Republics of the Caucasus, and should like to express the hope that their close alliance will serve as a model of national peace,unprecedented under the bourgeoisie and impossible underthe capitalist system. 
 But important as national peace among the workers and peasants of the Caucasian nationalities is, the maintenance and development of the Soviet power, as the transition to socialism, are even more important. 
 The task is difficult,but fully feasible. 
 The most important thing for its success-ful fulfilment is that the Communists of the Transcaucasusshould be fully alive to the singularity of their position, and of the position of their Republics, as distinct from the position and conditions of the R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
; that they should appreciate the need to refrain from copying our tactics,but thoughtfully vary them in adaptation to the differingconcrete conditions. 
 The Soviet Republic of Russia had no outside political or military assistance. 
 On the contrary, for years and years it fought the Entente military invasions and blockade. 
 The Soviet Republics of the Caucasus have had political and some military assistance from the R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
 Thisalone has made a vast difference. 
 Second, there is now no cause to fear any Entente inva-sion or military assistance to the Georgian, Azerbaijan, Armenian, Daghestan and mountaineer whiteguards. 
 The Entente “burnt their fingers” in Russia and that will prob-ably compel them to be more cautious for some time. 
 Third, the Caucasian Republics have an even more pronounced peasant character than Russia. 
 Fourth, Russia has been, and to a considerable extent still is, economically isolated from the advanced capitalistcountries. 
 The Caucasus is in a position to start tradingand “living together” with the capitalist West sooner andwith greater ease. 
 These are not all the differences, but they are sufficient to demonstrate the need for different tactics. 
 You will need to practise more moderation and caution, and show more readiness to make concessions to the pettybourgeoisie, the intelligentsia, and particularly the peas-antry. 
 You must make the swiftest, most intense andall possible economic use of the capitalist West through a policy of concessions and trade. 
 Oil, manganese, coal (Tkvarcheli mines) and copper are some of your immensemineral resources. 
 You have every possibility to developan extensive policy of concessions and trade with foreigncountries. 
 This must be done on a wide scale, with firmness, skill and circumspection, and it must be utiIised to the utmost for improving the condition of the workers and peasants,and for enlisting the intelligentsia in the work of economicconstruction. 
 Through trade with Italy, America and othercountries, you must exert every effort to develop the pro-ductive forces of your rich land, your water resources and irrigation which is especially important as a means of advancing agriculture and livestock farming. 
 What the Republics of the Caucasus can and must do, as distinct from the R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
, is to effect a slower, morecautious and more systematic transition to socialism. 
 Thatis what you must understand, and what you must be able to carry out, as distinct from our own tactics. 
 We fought to make the first breach in the wall of world capitalism. 
 The breach has been made. 
 We have maintainedour positions in a fierce and superhuman war against theWhites, the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Mensheviks,who were supported by the Entente countries, their blockade and military assistance. 
 You, Comrades Communists of the Caucasus, have no need to force a breach. 
 You must take advantage of the favourable international situation in 1921, and learn to build the new with greater caution and more method. 
 In 1921, Europe and the world are not what they were in 1917 and 1918. 
 Do not copy our tactics, but analyse the reasons for their peculiar features, the conditions that gave rise tothem, and their results; go beyond the letter, and applythe spirit, the essence and the lessons of the 1917-21 expe-rience. 
 You must make trade with the capitalist countries your economic foundation right away. 
 The cost should beno object even if it means letting them have tens of millions’worth of valuable minerals. 
 You must make immediate efforts to improve the con-dition of the peasants and start on extensive electrification and irrigation projects. 
 What you need most is irrigation, for more than anything else it will revive the area andregenerate it, bury the past and make the transition tosocialism more certain. 
 I hope you will pardon my slipshod style. 
 I have had to write the letter at very short notice, so as to send it along with Comrade Myasnikov. 
 Once again I send my best greetings and wishes to the workers and peasants of theSoviet Republics of the Caucasus.

 I send heartfelt greetings to the non-Party conference, and I welcome your work. 
 The assistance of the non-Party masses and co-operation with them is of especial importance today, whenthe bourgeoisie of the world is conducting an incredible cam-paign of lies against Soviet Russia, in an effort to preventus from concluding any trade agreements with foreigncountries. 
 The Kronstadt events have brought home to the workers and peasants the fact that any shift of power in Russia tends to favour the whiteguards; no wonder Milyu-kov and all intelligent leaders of the bourgeoisie welcomedthe Kronstadt “Soviets without the Bolsheviks” slogan. 
 In conveying my greetings to the non-Party conference, I should like to wish you every success in your work, and ask you to pay special attention to the present need—in fact a constant need—of drawing more non-Party workersand peasants into economic construction. 
 A regional eco-nomic centre has been set up in Petrograd. 
 Let us intensifyour effort.

 Written in late March-Published according early April 1921 to the manuscript THE TAX IN KIND (THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE NEW POLICY AND ITS CONDITIONS )102 IN LIEU OF INTRODUCTION The question of the tax in kind is at present attracting very great attention and is giving rise to much discussionand argument. 
 This is quite natural, because in presentconditions it is indeed one of the principal questions ofpolicy. 
 The discussion is somewhat disordered, a fault to which, for very obvious reasons, we must all plead guilty. 
 All themore useful would it be, therefore, to try to approachthe question, not from its “topical” aspect, but from theaspect of general principle. 
 In other words, to examine thegeneral, fundamental background of the picture on which we are now tracing the pattern of definite practical measures of present-day policy. 
 In order to make this attempt I will take the liberty of quoting a long passage from my pamphlet, The Chief Task of Our Day . 
 “Left-Wing ” Childishness and the Petty-Bourgeois Mentality . 
 It was published by the Petrograd Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies in 1918 and contains, first, a newspaper article, dated March 11, 1918, on the BrestPeace, and, second, my polemic against the then existinggroup of Left Communists, dated May 5, 1918. 
 The polemicis now superfluous and I omit it, leaving what appertains tothe discussion on ,”state capitalism” an the main elements of our present-day economy, which is transitional from capitalism to socialism. 
 Here is what I wrote at the time: THE PRESENT -DAY ECONOMY OF RUSSIA (EXTRACT THE 1918 PAMPHLET) State capitalism would be a step forward as compared with the present state of affairs in our Soviet Republic. 
If in approximately six months’ time state capitalismbecame established in our Republic, this would be a greatsuccess and a sure guarantee that within a year socialism will have gained a permanently firm hold and will have become invincible in this country. 
 I can imagine with what noble indignation some people will recoil from these words .... 
 What! The transition to state capitalism in the Soviet Socialist Republic would be a step forward?... Isn’t this the betrayal of socialism? We must deal with this point in greater detail. 
 Firstly, we must examine the nature of the transition from capitalism to socialism that gives us the right and thegrounds to call our country a Socialist Republic of Soviets. 
 Secondly, we must expose the error of those who fail to see the petty-bourgeois economic conditions and the petty-bourgeois element as the principal enemy of socialism in our country. 
 Thirdly, we must fully understand the economic implications of the distinction between the Soviet state and the bourgeois state. 
 Let us examine these three points. 
 No one, I think, in studying the question of the economic system of Russia, has denied its transitional character. 
Nor, I think, has any Communist denied that the termSoviet Socialist Republic implies the determination of theSoviet power to achieve the transition to socialism, andnot that the existing economic system is recognised as a socialist order. 
 But what does the word “transition” mean? Does it not mean, as applied to an economy, that the present systemcontains elements, particles, fragments of both capitalismand socialism? Everyone will admit that it does. 
 But notall who admit this take the trouble to consider what elements actually constitute the various socio-economic structures that exist in Russia at the present time. 
 And thisis the crux of the question. 
 Let us enumerate these elements: (1) patriarchal, i. 
e. 
, to a considerable extent natural, peasant farm-ing; (2) small commodity production (this includes the majority of those peasants who sell their grain); (3) private capitalism;(4) state capitalism;(5) socialism. 
 Russia is so vast and so varied that all these different types of socio-economic structures are intermingled. 
 Thisis what constitutes the specific feature of the situation. 
 The question arises: What elements predominate? Clearly, in a small-peasant country, the petty-bourgeoiselement predominates and it must predominate, for the great majority—those working the land—are small commodity producers. 
 The shell of state capitalism (grain monopoly,state-controlled entrepreneurs and traders, bourgeois co-operators) is pierced now in one place, now in another byprofiteers , the chief object of profiteering being grain . 
 It is in this field that the main struggle is being waged. 
 Between what elements is this struggle being waged if we are to speak in terms of economic categories such as “statecapitalism”? Between the fourth and fifth in the order inwhich I have just enumerated them? Of course not. 
 It isnot state capitalism that is at war with socialism, but thepetty bourgeoisie plus private capitalism fighting together against state capitalism and socialism. 
 The petty bourgeoi-sie oppose every kind of state interference, accounting and control, whether it be state-capitalist or state-socialist. 
This is an unquestionable fact of reality whose misunder-standing lies at the root of many economic mistakes. 
The profiteer, the commercial racketeer, the disrupter of monopoly—these are our principal “internal” enemies, the enemies of the economic measures of the Soviet power. 
 Ahundred and twenty-five years ago it might have beenexcusable for the French petty bourgeoisie, the most ardentand sincere revolutionaries, to try to crush the profiteerby executing a few of the “chosen” and by making thunder-ous declarations. 
 Today, however, the purely French approach to the question assumed by some Left Socialist-Revolutionaries can arouse nothing but disgust and re-vulsion in every politically conscious revolutionary. 
 We know perfectly well that the economic basis of profiteering is both the small proprietors, who are exceptionally wide-spread in Russia, and private capitalism, of which everypetty bourgeois is an agent. 
 We know that the milliontentacles of this petty-bourgeois octopus now and againencircle various sections of the workers, that instead of statemonopoly, profiteering forces its way into every pore of our social and economic organism. 
 Those who fail to see this show by their blindness that they are slaves of petty-bourgeois prejudices.... 
 The petty bourgeoisie have money put away, the few thousands that they made during the war by “honest” andespecially by dishonest means. 
 They are the characteristic economic type, that is, the basis of profiteering and private capitalism. 
 Money is a certificate entitling the possessor toreceive social wealth; and a vast section of small proprie-tors, numbering millions, cling to this certificate andconceal it from the “state”. 
 They do not believe in socialismor communism, and “mark time” until the proletarian storm blows over. 
 Either we subordinate the petty bourgeoi-sie to our control and accounting (we can do this if weorganise the poor, that is, the majority of the populationor semi-proletarians, round the politically conscious pro-letarian vanguard), or they will overthrow our workers’power as surely and as inevitably as the revolution was overthrown by the Napoleons and the Cavaignacs who sprang from this very soil of petty proprietorship. 
 That is howthe question stands. 
 That is the only view we can take ofthe matter.... 
 The petty bourgeois who hoards his thousands is an enemy of state capitalism. 
 He wants to employ these thousands just for himself, against the poor, in opposition to any kind of state control. 
 And the sum total of these thousands,amounting to many thousands of millions, forms the base forprofiteering, which undermines our socialist construction. 
Let us assume that a certain number of workers producein a few days values equal to 1,000. 
 Let us then assume that 200 of this total vanishes owing to petty profiteering, various kinds of embezzlement and the evasion by the smallproprietors of Soviet decrees and regulations. 
 Every politically conscious worker will say that if better order and organisation could be obtained at the price of 300 out of the 1,000 he would willingly give 300 instead of 200, for it will be quite easy under the Soviet power to reducethis “tribute” later on to, say, 100 or 50, once order andorganisation are established and the petty-bourgeoisdisruption of state monopoly is completely overcome. 
 This simple illustration in figures, which I have deliberately simplified to the utmost in order to make it absolutely clear, explains the present correlation of statecapitalism and socialism. 
 The workers hold state powerand have every legal opportunity of “taking” the wholethousand, without giving up a single kopek, except forsocialist purposes. 
 This legal opportunity, which rests upon the actual transition of power to the workers, is an element of socialism. 
 But in many ways, the small-proprietary andprivate-capitalist element undermines this legal position,drags in profiteering and hinders the execution of Sovietdecrees. 
 State capitalism would be a gigantic step forwardeven if we paid more than we are paying at present (I took the numerical example deliberately to bring this out more sharply), because it is worth paying for “tuition”, because itis useful for the workers, because victory over disorder,economic ruin and laxity is the most important thing,because the continuation of the anarchy of small ownership-is the greatest, the most serious danger, and it will certainly be our ruin (unless we overcome it), whereas not only will the payment of a heavier tribute to state capitalism notruin us, it will lead us to socialism by the surest road. 
When the working class has learned how to defend the statesystem against the anarchy of small ownership, when it haslearned to organise large-scale production on a national scale along state-capitalist lines, it will hold, if I may use the expression, all the trump cards, and the consoli-dation of socialism will be assured. 
 In the first place economically state capitalism is immeas-urably superior to our present economic system. 
 In the second place there is nothing terrible in it for the Soviet power, for the Soviet state is a state in which the power of the workers and the poor is assured.... 
 * * To make things even clearer, let us first of all take the most concrete example of state capitalism. 
 Everybody knows what this example is. 
 It is Germany. 
 Here we have “the last word” in modern large-scale capitalist engineeringand planned organisation, subordinated to Junker-bourgeois imperialism . 
 Cross out the words in italics, and in place of the militarist, Junker, bourgeois, imperialist state put alsoa state, but of a different social type, of a different class content—a Soviet state, that is, a proletarian state, and you will have the sum total of the conditions necessary forsocialism. 
 Socialism is inconceivable without large-scale capitalist engineering based on the latest discoveries of modern science. 
It is inconceivable without planned state organisation which keeps tens of millions of people to the strictest observance of a unified standard in production and distribution. 
 WeMarxists have always spoken of this, and it is not worthwhile wasting two seconds talking to people who do notunderstand even this (anarchists and a good half of the LeftSocialist-Revolutionaries). 
 At the same time socialism is inconceivable unless the proletariat is the ruler of the state. 
 This also is ABC. 
 Andhistory (which nobody, except Menshevik blockheads of thefirst order, ever expected to bring about “complete” social-ism smoothly, gently, easily and simply) has taken such apeculiar course that it has given birth in 1918 to two un-connected halves of socialism existing side by side like two future chickens in the single shell of international imperial-ism. 
 In 1918, Germany and Russia had become the moststriking embodiment of the material realisation of theeconomic, the productive and the socio-economic conditionsfor socialism, on the one hand, and the political conditions, on the other. 
 A victorious proletarian revolution in Germany would immediately and very easily smash any shell of imperialism(which unfortunately is made of the best steel, and hencecannot be broken by the efforts of any chicken) and wouldbring about the victory of world socialism for certain, without any difficulty, or with only slight difficulty—if, of course, by “difficulty” we mean difficulty on a worldhistorical scale, and 44 not in the parochial philistine sense. 
 While the revolution in Germany is still slow in “coming forth”, our task is to study the state capitalism of the Germans, to spare no effort in copying it and not shrink from adopting dictatorial methods to hasten the copying ofWestern culture by barbarian Russia, without hesitatingto use barbarous methods in fighting barbarism. 
 If thereare anarchists and Left Socialist-Revolutionaries (I recalloffhand the speeches of Karelin and Ghe at the meeting of the Central Executive Committee) who indulge in Karelin-like reflections and say that it is unbecoming for us revo-lutionaries to “take lessons” from German imperialism,there is only one thing we can say in reply: the revolutionthat took these people seriously would perish irrevocably(and deservedly). 
 At present petty-bourgeois capitalism prevails in Russia, and it is one and the same road that leads from it to both large-scale state capitalism and to socialism, through one and the same intermediary station called “national accounting and control of production and distribution”. 
Those who fail to understand this are committing an un-pardonable mistake in economics. 
 Either they do not know the facts of life, do not see what actually exists and areunable to look the truth in the face, or they confinethemselves to abstractly comparing “socialism” with“capitalism” and fail to study the concrete forms and stagesof the transition that is taking place in our country. 
 Let it be said in parenthesis that this is the very theoret-ical mistake which misled the best people in the Novaya Zhizn and Vperyod 103 camp. 
 The worst and the mediocre * of these, owing to their stupidity and spinelessness, tag along behind the bourgeoisie, of whom they stand in awe;the best of them have failed to understand that it was not without reason that the teachers of socialism spoke of a whole period of transition from capitalism to socialismand emphasised the “prolonged birth pangs” of the newsociety. 
 104 And this new society is again an abstraction which can come into being only by passing through a series ofvaried, imperfect and concrete attempts to create this or that socialist state. 
 It is because Russia cannot advance from the economic situation now existing-here without traversing the ground which is common to state capitalism and to socialism (national accounting and control) that the attempt to frighten others as well as themselves with “evolution towards state capitalism” is utter theoretical nonsense. 
 This is lettingone’s thoughts wander away from the true road of“evolution”, and failing to understand what this road is. 
 Inpractice, it is equivalent to pulling us back to small-proprietary capitalism. 
 In order to convince the reader that this is not the first time I have given this “high” appreciation of state capital-ism and that I gave it before the Bolsheviks seized power, I take the liberty of quoting the following passage frommy pamphlet, The Impending Catastrophe and How To Combat It , written in September 1917. 
 “Try to substitute for the Junker-capitalist state, for the landowner-capitalist state, a revolutionary-democraticstate, i. 
e. 
, a state which in a revolutionary way abolishesall privileges and does not fear to introduce the fullestdemocracy in a revolutionary way. 
 You will find that, givena really revolutionary-democratic state, state-monopoly capitalism inevitably and unavoidably implies a step ... to-wards socialism.... 
 “For socialism is merely the next step forward from state-capitalist monopoly.... 
 “State-monopoly capitalism is a complete material pre-paration for socialism, the threshold of socialism, a rung on the ladder of history between which and the rung called socialism there are no intermediate rungs” (pp. 
 27 and 28). 
 Please note that this was written when Kerensky was in power, that we are discussing not the dictatorship of the proletariat, not the socialist state, but the “revolutionary-democratic” state. 
 Is it not clear that the higher we stand on this political ladder, the more completely we incorporate the socialist state and the dictatorship of the proletariatin the Soviets, the less ought we to fear “state capitalism”? Is it not clear that from the material , economic and pro-ductive point of view, we are not yet on the “threshold”of socialism? Is it not clear that we cannot pass through the door of socialism without crossing the “threshold” we have not yet reached?... * * * The following is also extremely instructive. 
 When we argued with Comrade Bukharin in the Central Executive Committee, he declared, among other things, that on the question of high salaries for specialists “they” were“to the right of Lenin”, for in this case “they” saw nodeviation from principle, bearing in mind Marx’s words thatunder certain conditions it is more expedient for the work-ing class to “buy out the whole lot of them” 105 (namely, the whole lot of capitalists, i. 
e. 
, to buy from the bourgeoisie the land, factories, works and other means of production). 
 That is a very interesting statement .... 
 Let us consider Marx’s idea carefully. 
Marx was talking about the Britain of the seventies of the last century, about the culminating point in the development of pre-monopoly capitalism. 
 At that time Britain was a country in which militarism and bureaucracywere less pronounced than in any other, a country in whichthere was the greatest possibility of a “peaceful” victoryfor socialism in the sense of the workers “buying out” thebourgeoisie. 
 And Marx said that under certain conditions the workers would certainly not refuse to buy out the bour-geoisie. 
 Marx did not commit himself, or the future leadersof the socialist revolution, to matters of form, to ways andmeans of bringing about the revolution. 
 He understoodperfectly well that a vast number of new problems wouldarise, that the whole situation would change in the course of the revolution, and that the situation would change radically and often in the course of the revolution. 
 Well, and what about Soviet Russia? Is it not clear that after the seizure of power by the proletariat and after the crushing of the exploiters’ armed resistance and sabotage—certain conditions prevail which correspond to those which might have existed in Britain half a century ago had a peace-ful transition to socialism begun there? The subordinationof the capitalists to the workers in Britain would have beenassured at that time owing to the following circumstances:(1) the absolute preponderance of workers, of proletarians,in the population owing to the absence of a peasantry (in Britain in the seventies there where signs that gave hope of an extremely rapid spread of socialism among agriculturallabourers); (2) the excellent organisation of the proletariat in trade unions (Britain was at that time the leading country in the world in this respect); (3) the comparatively high level of culture of the proletariat, which had been trained by centuries of development of political liberty; (4) the oldhabit of the well-organised British capitalists of settlingpolitical and economic questions by compromise—at thattime the British capitalists were better organised than thecapitalists of any country in the world (this superiority has now passed to Germany). 
 These were the circumstances which at the time gave rise to the idea that the peaceful subjugation of the British capitalists by the workers waspossible. 
 In our country, at the present time, this subjugation is assured by certain premises of fundamental significance (the victory in October and the suppression, from October to February, of the capitalists’ armed resistance and sabotage). 
But instead of the absolute preponderance of workers, of proletarians, in the population, and instead of a high degree of organisation among them, the important factor of victoryin Russia was the support the proletarians received from the poor peasants and those who had experienced sudden ruin. 
 Finally, we have neither a high degree of culture northe habit of compromise. 
 If these concrete conditions arecarefully considered, it will become clear that we now canand ought to employ a combination of two methods. 
 On the one hand, we must ruthlessly suppress the uncultured capitalists who refuse to have anything to do with “state capitalism” or to consider any form of compromise, and whocontinue by means of profiteering, by bribing the poorpeasants, etc. 
, to hinder the realisation of the measurestaken by the Soviets. 
 On the other hand, we must usethe method of compromise , or of buying out the cultured capitalists who agree to “state capitalism”, who are capable of putting it into practice and who are useful to theproletariat as intelligent and experienced organisers of thelargest types of enterprises, which actually supplyproducts to tens of millions of people. 
 Bukharin is an extremely well-read Marxist economist. 
 He therefore remembered that Marx was profoundly right when he taught the workers the importance of preservingthe organisation of large-scale production, precisely for the purpose of facilitating the transition to socialism. 
 Marx taught that (as an exception, and Britain was then an exception) the idea was conceivable of paying the capitalists well , of buying them out, if the circumstances were such as to compel the capitalists to submit peacefully and to comeover to socialism in a cultured and organised fashion,provided they were paid well. 
 But Bukharin went astray because he did not go deep enough into the specific features of the situation in Russia at the present time—an exceptional situation when we,the Russian proletariat, are in advance of any Britain or any Germany as regards political system, as regards thestrength of the workers’ political power, but are behind the most backward West-European country as regards organ-ising a good state capitalism, as regards our level of culture and the degree of material and productive preparednessfor the “introduction” of socialism. 
 Is it not clear that thespecific nature of the present situation creates the need fora specific type of “buying out” operation which the work-ers must offer to the most cultured, the most talented, the most capable organisers among the capitalists who are ready to enter the service of the Soviet power and to helphonestly in organising “state” production on the largestpossible scale? Is it not clear that in this specific situationwe must make every effort to avoid two mistakes, bothof which are of a petty-bourgeois nature? On the one hand, it would be a fatal mistake to declare that since there is a discrepancy between our economic “forces” and our po-litical strength, it “follows” that we should not have seizedpower. 
 Such an argument can be advanced only by a “manin a muffler”, who forgets that there will always be such a“discrepancy”, that it always exists in the development of nature as well as in the development of society, that only by a series of attempts—each of which, taken by itself, willbe one-sided and will suffer from certain inconsistencies—will complete socialism be created by the revolutionary co-operation of the proletarians of all countries. 
 On the other hand, it would be an obvious mistake to give free rein to ranters and phrase-mongers who allow them-selves to be carried away by the “dazzling” revolutionaryspirit, but who are incapable of sustained, thoughtful and deliberate revolutionary work which takes into account the most difficult stages of transition. 
 Fortunately, the history of the development of revolution-ary parties and of the struggle that Bolshevism wagedagainst them has left us a heritage of sharply defined types,of which the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries and anarchistsare striking examples of bad revolutionaries. 
 They are nowshouting hysterically, choking and shouting themselves hoarse, against the “compromise” of the “Right Bolsheviks”. 
 But they are incapable of understanding what is bad in “compromise”, and why “compromise” has been justly condemned by history and the course of the revolution. 
 Compromise in Kerensky’s time meant the surrender of power to the imperialist bourgeoisie, and the question of power is the fundamental question of every revolution. 
 Compromise by a section of the Bolsheviks in October-November 1917 either meant that they feared the proletar-iat seizing power or wished to share power equally, not only with “unreliable fellow-travellers” like the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, but also with enemies, with the Chernov-ists and the Mensheviks. 
 The latter would inevitably have hindered us in fundamental matters, such as the dissolutionof the Constituent Assembly, the ruthless suppression ofthe Bogayevskys, the universal setting up of the Sovietinstitutions, and in every act of confiscation. 
 Now power has been seized, retained and consolidated in the hands of a single party, the party of the proletariat, even without the “unreliable fellow-travellers”. 
 To speakof compromise at the present time when there is no question,and can be none, of sharing power , of renouncing the dicta-torship of the proletariat over the bourgeoisie, is merelyto repeat, parrot-fashion, words which have been learned by heart but not understood. 
 To describe as “compromise” the fact that, having arrived at a situation when we canand must rule the country, we try to win over to our side,not grudging the cost, the most efficient people capitalismhas trained and to take them into our service against smallproprietary disintegration, reveals a total incapacity to think about the economic tasks of socialist construction. 
 TAX IN KIND, FREEDOM TO TRADE AND CONCESSIONS In the arguments of 1918 quoted above there are a number of mistakes as regards the periods of time involved. 
 Theseturned out to be longer than was anticipated at that time. 
That is not surprising. 
 But the basic elements of oureconomy have remained the same. 
 In a very large number ofcases the peasant “poor” (proletarians and semi-proletar-ians) have become middle peasants. 
 This has caused an increase in the small-proprietor, petty-bourgeois “element”. 
The Civil War of 1918-20 aggravated the havoc in thecountry, retarded the restoration of its productive forces, andbled the proletariat more than any other class. 
 To this wasadded the 1920 crop failure, the fodder shortage and the loss of cattle, which still further retarded the rehabilitation of transport and industry, because, among other things, itinterfered with the employment of peasants’ horses forcarting wood, our main type of fuel. 
 As a result, the political situation in the spring of 1921 was such that immediate, very resolute and urgent measures had to be taken to improve the condition of the peasants and to increase their productive forces. 
 Why the peasants and not the workers?Because you need grain and fuel to improve the condition of the workers. 
 This is the biggest “hitch” at the presenttime, from the standpoint of the economy as a whole. 
 For it is impossible to increase the production and collection of grain and the storage and delivery of fuel except by improv-ing the condition of the peasantry, and raising theirproductive forces. 
 We must start with the peasantry. 
 Thosewho fail to understand this, and think this putting the peas-antry in the forefront is “renunciation” of the dictatorship of the proletariat, or something like that, simply do not stop to think, and allow themselves to be swayed by thepower of words. 
 The dictatorship of the proletariat is thedirection of policy by the proletariat. 
 The proletariat, asthe leading and ruling class, must be able to direct policyin such a way as to solve first the most urgent and “vexed” problem. 
 The most urgent thing at the present time is to take measures that will immediately increase the productiveforces of peasant farming. 
 Only in this way will it be the alliance between the workers and peasants, and con-solidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
 The prole-tarian or representative of the proletariat who refused to improve the condition of the workers in this way would in fact prove himself to be an accomplice of the whiteguards and the capitalists; to refuse to do it in this way meansputting the craft interests of the workers above their classinterests, and sacrificing the interests of the whole of the working class, its dictatorship, its alliance with the peasant-ry against the landowners and capitalists, and its leadingrole in the struggle for the emancipation of labour fromthe yoke of capital, for the sake of an immediate, short-term and partial advantage for the workers. 
 Thus, the first thing we need is immediate and serious measures to raise the productive forces of the peasantry. 
 This cannot be done without making important changes in our food policy. 
 One such change was the replacement ofthe surplus appropriation system by the tax in kind, whichimplies a free market, at least in local economic exchange,after the tax has been paid. 
 What is the essence of this change? Wrong ideas on this point are widespread. 
 They are due mainly to the fact that no attempt is being made to studythe meaning of the transition or to determine its implica-tions, it being assumed that the change is from communismin general to the bourgeois system in general. 
 To counteract this mistake, one has to refer to what was said in May 1918. 
 The tax in kind is one of the forms of transition from that peculiar War Communism, which was forced on us byextreme want, ruin and war, to regular socialist exchange ofproducts. 
 The latter, in its turn, is one of the forms of tran-sition from socialism, with the peculiar features due to the predominantly small-peasant population, to communism. 
 Under this peculiar War Communism we actually took from the peasant all his surpluses—and sometimes even apart of his necessaries—to meet the requirements of the armyand sustain the workers. 
 Most of it we took on loan, forpaper money. 
 But for that, we would not have beaten the landowners and capitalists in a ruined small-peasant coun-try. 
 The fact that we did (in spite of the help our exploitersgot from the most powerful countries of the world) shows not only the miracles of heroism the workers and peasants can perform in the struggle for their emancipation; it also shows that when the Mensheviks, Socialist-Revolutionaries and Kautsky and Co. 
 blamed us for this War Communism they were acting as lackeys of the bourgeoisie. 
 We deservecredit for it. 
 Just how much credit is a fact of equal importance. 
 It was the war and the ruin that forced us into War Communism. 
 It was not, and could not be, a policy that corresponded to the economic tasks of the proletariat. 
 It was a makeshift. 
The correct policy of the proletariat exercising its dictator-ship in a small-peasant country is to obtain grain in ex-change for the manufactured goods the peasant needs. 
 Thatis the only kind of food policy that corresponds to the tasks of the proletariat, and can strengthen the foundations of socialism and lead to its complete victory. 
 The tax in kind is a transition to this policy. 
 We are still so ruined and crushed by the burden of war (which wason but yesterday and could break out anew tomorrow, owingto the rapacity and malice of the capitalists) that we cannot give the peasant manufactured goods in return for all the grain we need. 
 Being aware of this, we are introducingthe tax in kind, that is, we shall take the minimum of grainwe require (for the army and the workers) in the form of atax and obtain the rest in exchange for manufacturedgoods. 
 There is something else we must not forget. 
 Our poverty and ruin are so great that we cannot restore large-scalesocialist state industry at one stroke . 
 This can be done with large stocks of grain and fuel in the big industrial centres,replacement of worn-out machinery, and so on. 
 Experiencehas convinced us that this cannot be done at one stroke, and we know that after the ruinous imperialist war even the wealthiest and most advanced countries will be ableto solve this problem only over a fairly long period of years. 
Hence, it is necessary, to a certain extent, to help to re-store small industry, which does not demand of the state machines, large stocks of raw material, fuel and food, and which can immediately render some assistance to peasant farming and increase its productive forces right away. 
 What is to be the effect of all this? It is the revival of the petty bourgeoisie and of capitalism on the basis of some freedom of trade (if only local). 
 That much is certain and it is ridiculous to shut our eyes to it. 
 Is it necessary? Can it be justified? Is it not dangerous?Many such questions are being asked, and most are merely evidence of simple-mindedness, to put it mildly. 
 Look at my May 1918 definition of the elements (constituent parts) of the various socio-economic structures in our economy. 
 No one can deny the existence of all these five stages (or constituent parts), of the five forms ofeconomy—from the patriarchal, i. 
e. 
, semi-barbarian, to thesocialist system. 
 That the small-peasant “structure”, partlypatriarchal, partly petty bourgeois, predominates in a small-peasant country is self-evident. 
 It is an incontrovertible truth, elementary to political economy, which even the lay-man’s everyday experience will confirm, that once youhave exchange the small economy is bound to develop thepetty-bourgeois-capitalist way. 
 What is the policy the socialist proletariat can pursue in the face of this economic reality? Is it to give the small peasant all he needs of the goods produced by large-scale socialist industries in exchange for his grain and rawmaterials? This would be the most desirable and “correct”policy—and we have started on it. 
 But we cannot supply all the goods, very far from it; nor shall we be able to do so verysoon—at all events not until we complete the first stage of the electrification of the whole country. 
 What is to be done? One way is to try to prohibit entirely, to put thelock on all development of private, non-state exchange,i. 
e. 
, trade, i. 
e. 
, capitalism, which is inevitable with millionsof small producers. 
 But such a policy would be foolishand suicidal for the party that tried to apply it. 
 It would be foolish because it is economically impossible. 
 It would be suicidal because the party that tried to apply it wouldmeet with inevitable disaster. 
 Let us admit it: someCommunists have sinned “in thought, word and deed” byadopting just such a policy. 
 We shall try to rectify these mistakes, and this must be done without fail, otherwise things will come to a very sorry state. 
 The alternative (and this is the only sensible and the last possible policy) is not to try to prohibit or put the lock on the development of capitalism, but to channel it into state capitalism . 
 This is economically possible, for state capitalism exists—in varying form and degree—wherever there are elements of unrestricted trade and capitalism in general. 
 Can the Soviet state and the dictatorship of the proletariat be combined with state capitalism? Are theycompatible? Of course they are. 
 This is exactly what I argued in May 1918. 
 I hope I had proved it then. 
 I had also proved that state capitalism is a step forward compared with the small-proprietor (both small-patriarchal and petty-bourgeois)element. 
 Those who compare state capitalism only withsocialism commit a host of mistakes, for in the presentpolitical and economic circumstances it is essential to com-pare state capitalism also with petty-bourgeois production. 
 The whole problem—in theoretical and practical terms— is to find the correct methods of directing the developmentof capitalism (which is to some extent and for some timeinevitable) into the channels of state capitalism, and todetermine how we are to hedge it about with conditions to ensure its transformation into socialism in the near future. 
 In order to approach the solution of this problem we must first of all picture to ourselves as distinctly as possiblewhat state capitalism will and can be in practice inside theSoviet system and within the framework of the Soviet state. 
 Concessions are the simplest example of how the Soviet government directs the development of capitalism into the channels of state capitalism and “implants” state capital-ism. 
 We all agree now that concessions are necessary, buthave we all thought about the implications? What areconcessions under the Soviet system, viewed in the light ofthe above-mentioned forms of economy and their inter-relations? They are an agreement, an alliance, a bloc between the Soviet, i. 
e. 
, proletarian, state power and state capitalismagainst the small-proprietor (patriarchal and petty-bour-geois) element. 
 The concessionaire is a capitalist. 
 Heconducts his business on capitalist lines, for profit, and iswilling to enter into an agreement with the proletarian government in order to obtain superprofits or raw materials which he cannot otherwise obtain, or can obtain only withgreat difficulty. 
 Soviet power gains by the development of the productive forces, and by securing an increased quan-tity of goods immediately, or within a very short period. 
 We have, say, a hundred oilfields, mines and forest tracts. 
 We cannot develop all of them for we lack the machines,the food and the transport. 
 This is also why we are doingnext to nothing to develop the other territories. 
 Owingto the insufficient development of the large enterprises thesmall-proprietor element is more pronounced in all its forms, and this is reflected in the deterioration of the surrounding (and later the whole of) peasant farming, the disruption ofits productive forces, the decline in its confidence in theSoviet power, pilfering and widespread petty (the mostdangerous) profiteering, etc. 
 By “implanting” state capi-talism in the form of concessions, the Soviet government strengthens large-scale production as against petty produc-tion, advanced production as against backward production,and machine production as against hand production. 
 Italso obtains a larger quantity of the products of large-scaleindustry (its share of the output), and strengthens state-regulated economic relations as against the anarchy of petty-bourgeois relations. 
 The moderate and cautious application of the concessions policy will undoubtedly help us quicklyto improve (to a modest extent) the state of industry andthe condition of the workers and peasants. 
 We shall, ofcourse, have all this at the price of certain sacrifices andthe surrender to the capitalist of many millions of poods of very valuable products. 
 The scale and the conditions under which concessions cease to be a danger and are turnedto our advantage depend on the relation of forces and aredecided in the struggle, for concessions are also a form ofstruggle, and are a continuation of the class struggle inanother form, and in no circumstances are they a substitu-tion of class peace for class war. 
 Practice will determine the methods of struggle. 
 Compared with other forms of state capitalism within the Soviet system, concessions are perhaps the most simple andclear-cut form of state capitalism. 
 It involves a formalwritten agreement with the most civilised, advanced, West-European capitalism. 
 We know exactly what our gains and our losses, our rights and obligations are. 
 We know exactlythe term for which the concession is granted. 
 We know the terms of redemption before the expiry of the agreement if it provides for such redemption. 
 We pay a certain “tribute” to world capitalism; we “ransom” ourselves under certain arrangements, thereby immediately stabilising the Sovietpower and improving our economic conditions. 
 The wholedifficulty with concessions is giving the proper considera-tion and appraisal of all the circumstances when concludinga concession agreement, and then seeing that it is fulfilled. 
 Difficulties there certainly are, and mistakes will probably be inevitable at the outset. 
 But these are minor diffi-culties compared with the other problems of the socialrevolution and, in particular, with the difficulties arisingfrom other forms of developing, permitting and implantingstate capitalism. 
 The most important task that confronts all Party and Soviet workers in connection with the introduction of thetax in kind is to apply the principles of the “concessions”policy (i. 
e. 
, a policy that is similar to “concession” statecapitalism) to the other forms of capitalism—unrestrictedtrade, local exchange, etc. 
 Take the co-operatives. 
 It is not surprising that the tax in kind decree immediately necessitated a revision of theregulations governing the co-operatives and a certain ex-tension of their “freedom” and rights. 
 The co-operatives arealso a form of state capitalism, but a less simple one; itsoutline is less distinct, it is more intricate and therefore creates greater practical difficulties for the government. 
 The small commodity producers’ co-operatives (and it isthese, and not the workers’ co-operatives, that we arediscussing as the predominant and typical form in a small-peasant country) inevitably give rise to petty-bourgeois,capitalist relations, facilitate their development, push the small capitalists into the foreground and benefit them most. 
 It cannot be otherwise, since the small proprietors predomi-nate, and exchange is necessary and possible. 
 In Russia’spresent conditions, freedom and rights for the co-operativesocieties mean freedom and rights for capitalism. 
 It wouldbe stupid or criminal to close our eyes to this obvious truth. 
 But, unlike private capitalism, “co-operative” capitalism under the Soviet system is a variety of state capitalism, andas such it is advantageous and useful for us at the present time—in certain measure, of course. 
 Since the tax in kind means the free sale of surplus grain (over and above that taken in the form of the tax), we must exert every effort to direct this development of capitalism—for a free market is development of capitalism—into the channels of co-operative capitalism. 
 It resembles state capitalism in thatit facilitates accounting, control, supervision and the estab-lishment of contractual relations between the state (in this case the Soviet state) and the capitalist. 
 Co-operative trade is more advantageous and useful than private trade not onlyfor the above-mentioned reasons, but also because itfacilitates the association and organisation of millions ofpeople, and eventually of the entire population, and this inits turn is an enormous gain from the standpoint of the subsequent transition from state capitalism to socialism. 
 Let us make a comparison of concessions and co-operatives as forms of state capitalism. 
 Concessions are basedon large-scale machine industry; co-operatives are based onsmall, handicraft, and partly even on patriarchal industry. 
Each concession agreement affects one capitalist, firm, syndicate, cartel or trust. 
 Co-operative societies embrace many thousands and even millions of small proprietors. 
Concessions allow and even imply a definite agreement for aspecified period. 
 Co-operative societies allow of neither. 
It is much easier to repeal the law on the co-operativesthan to annul a concession agreement, but the annulment of an agreement means a sudden rupture of the practical rela-tions of economic alliance, or economic coexistence, with thecapitalist, whereas the repeal of the law on the co-opera-tives, or any law, for that matter, does not immediatelybreak off the practical coexistence of Soviet power and thesmall capitalists, nor, in general, is it able to break off the actual economic relations. 
 It is easy to “keep an eye” on a concessionaire but not on the co-operators. 
 The transitionfrom concessions to socialism is a transition from one formof large-scale production to another. 
 The transition fromsmall-proprietor co-operatives to socialism is a transitionfrom small to large-scale production, i. 
e. 
, it is more com-plicated, but, if successful, is capable of embracing wider masses of the population, and pulling up the deeper andmore tenacious roots of the old, pre-socialist and even pre-capitalist relations, which most stubbornly resist all “innovations”. 
 The concessions policy, if successful, will give us a few model—compared with our own—large en-terprises built on the level of modern advanced capitalism. 
After a few decades these enterprises will revert to us intheir entirety. 
 The co-operative policy, if successful, willresult in raising the small economy and in facilitating itstransition, within an indefinite period, to large-scale production on the basis of voluntary association. 
 Take a third form of state capitalism. 
 The state enlists the capitalist as a merchant and pays him a definite com-mission on the sale of state goods and on the purchase ofthe produce of the small producer. 
 A fourth form: the stateleases to the capitalist entrepreneur an industrial establish-ment, oilfields, forest tracts, land, etc. 
, which belong to the state, the lease being very similar to a concessionagreement. 
 We make no mention of, we give no thought ornotice to, these two latter forms of state capitalism, notbecause we are strong and clever but because we are weakand foolish. 
 We are afraid to look the “vulgar truth” squarely in the face, and too often yield to “exalting deception”. 
 106 We keep repeating that “we” are passing from capitalism to socialism, but do not bother to obtain adistinct picture of the “we”. 
 To keep this picture clear wemust constantly have in mind the whole list—without anyexception—of the constituent parts of our national economy, of all its diverse forms that I gave in my article of May 5, 1918. 
 “We”, the vanguard, the advanced contingentof the proletariat, are passing directly to socialism; but theadvanced contingent is only a small part of the whole of theproletariat while the latter, in its turn, is only a small partof the whole population. 
 If “we” are successfully to solve the problem of our immediate transition to socialism, we must understand what intermediary paths, methods, means and instruments are required for the transition from pre-capitalist relations to socialism. 
 That is the whole point. 
 Look at the map of the R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
 There is room for dozens of large civilised states in those vast areas which lie to the north of Vologda, the south-east of Rostov-on-Don and Saratov, the south of Orenburg and Omsk, and thenorth of Tomsk. 
 They are a realm of patriarchalism, and semi-and downright barbarism. 
 And what about the peasant backwoods of the rest of Russia, where scores of versts of country track, or rather of trackless country, lie between the villages and the railways, i. 
e. 
, the material link withthe big cities, large-scale industry, capitalism and culture?Isn’t that also an area of wholesale patriarchalism, Oblo-movism 107 and semi-barbarism? Is an immediate transition to socialism from the state of affairs predominating in Russia conceivable? Yes, it is, to a certain degree, but on one condition, the precisenature of which we now know thanks to a great piece ofscientific work 108 that has been completed. 
 It is electrifica-tion. 
 If we construct scores of district electric powerstations (we now know where and how these can and should be constructed), and transmit electric power to every village, if we obtain a sufficient number of electric motorsand other machinery, we shall not need, or shall hardlyneed, any transition stages or intermediary links betweenpatriarchalism and socialism. 
 But we know perfectly wellthat it will take at least ten years only to complete the first stage of this “one” condition; this period can be conceivably reduced only if the proletarian revolution is victorious insuch countries as Britain, Germany or the U. 
S. 
A. 
 Over the next few years we must learn to think of the intermediary links that can facilitate the transition frompatriarchalism and small production to socialism. 
 “We” continue saying now and again that “capitalism is a bane and socialism is a boon”. 
 But such-an argument is wrong,because it fails to take into account the aggregate of theexisting economic forms and singles out only two of them. 
 Capitalism is a bane compared with socialism. 
 Capital-ism is a boon compared with medievalism, small produc-tion, and the evils of bureaucracy which spring from the dispersal of the small producers. 
 Inasmuch as we are asyet unable to pass directly from small production to social-ism, some capitalism is inevitable as the elemental productof small production and exchange; so that we must utilisecapitalism (particularly by directing it into the channels of state capitalism) as the intermediary link between small production and socialism, as a means, a path, and a methodof increasing the productive forces. 
 Look at the economic aspect of the evils of bureaucracy. 
 We see nothing of them on May 5, 1918. 
 Six months after the October Revolution, with the old bureaucratic apparatus smashed from top to bottom, we feel none of its evils. 
 A year later, the Eighth Congress of the Russian Com-munist Party (March 18-23, 1919)109 adopted a new Party Programme in which we spoke forthrightly of “ a partial revival of bureaucracy within the Soviet system ”—not fear-ing to admit the evil, but desiring to reveal, expose and pillory it and to stimulate thought, will, energy and actionto combat it. 
 Two years later, in the spring of 1921, after the Eighth Congress of Soviets (December 1920), which discussed theevils of bureaucracy, and after the Tenth Congress of the Russian Communist Party (March 1921), which summed up the controversies closely connected with an analysis ofthese evils, we find them even more distinct and sinister. 
 What are their economic roots? They are mostly of a dualcharacter: on the one hand, a developed bourgeoisie needsa bureaucratic apparatus, primarily a military apparatus, and then a judiciary, etc. 
, to use against the revolutionary movement of the workers (and partly of the peasants). 
 Thatis something we have not got. 
 Ours are class courts directedagainst the bourgeoisie. 
 Ours is a class army directedagainst the bourgeoisie. 
 The evils of bureaucracy are notin the army, but in the institutions serving it. 
 In our coun-try bureaucratic practices have different economic roots, namely, the atomised and scattered state of the small pro-ducer with his poverty, illiteracy, lack of culture, the ab-sence of roads and exchange between agriculture and in-dustry, the absence of connection and interaction betweenthem. 
 This is largely the result of the Civil War. 
 We could not restore industry when we were blockaded, besieged on all sides, cut off from the whole world and later fromthe grain-bearing South, Siberia, and the coalfields. 
 Wecould not afford to hesitate in introducing War Communism,or daring to go to the most desperate extremes: to save theworkers’ and peasants’ rule we had to suffer an existence of semi-starvation and worse than semi-starvation, but to hold on at all costs, in spite of unprecedented ruin and theabsence of economic intercourse. 
 We did not allow ourselves to be frightened, as the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Men-sheviks did (who, in fact, followed the bourgeoisie largely because they were scared). 
 But the factor that was crucial to victory in a blockaded country—a besieged fortress—revealed its negative side by the spring of 1921, just whenthe last of the whiteguard forces were finally driven fromthe territory of the R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
 In the besieged fortress,it was possible and imperative to “lock up” all exchange; with the masses displaying extraordinary heroism this could be borne for three years. 
 After that, the ruin of the smallproducer increased, and the restoration of large-scale in-dustry was further delayed, and postponed. 
 Bureaucraticpractices, as a legacy of the “siege” and the superstructurebuilt over the isolated and downtrodden state of the small producer, fully revealed themselves. 
 We must learn to admit an evil fearlessly in order to combat it the more firmly, in order to start from scratchagain and again; we shall have to do this many a time inevery sphere of our activity, finish what was left undoneand choose different approaches to the problem. 
 In view of the obvious delay in the restoration of large-scale industry, the “locking up” of exchange between industry and agri-culture has become intolerable. 
 Consequently, we mustconcentrate on what we can do: restoring small industry,helping things from that end, propping up the side of thestructure that has been half-demolished by the war and blockade. 
 We must do everything possible to develop trade at all costs, without being afraid of capitalism, becausethe limits we have put to it (the expropriation of the land-owners and of the bourgeoisie in the economy, the rule ofthe workers and peasants in politics) are sufficiently narrowand “moderate”. 
 This is the fundamental idea and economic significance of the tax in kind. 
 All Party and Soviet workers must concentrate their efforts and attention on generating the utmost local initia-tive in economic development—in the gubernias, still morein the uyezds, still more in the volosts and villages—for thespecial purpose of immediately improving peasant farming, even if by “small” means, on a small scale, helping it by developing small local industry. 
 The integrated stateeconomic plan demands that this should become the focus of concern and “priority” effort. 
 Some improvement here, closest to the broadest and deepest “foundation”, will permit of the speediest transition to a more vigorous and successful restoration of large-scale industry. 
 Hitherto the food supply worker has known only one fundamental instruction: collect 100 per cent of the grainappropriations. 
 Now he has another instruction: collect100 per cent of the tax in the shortest possible time and then collect another 100 per cent in exchange for the goods of large-scale and small industry. 
 Those who collect 75 per cent of the tax and 75 per cent (of the second hundred) inexchange for the goods of large scale and small industrywill be doing more useful work of national importance thanthose who collect 100 per cent of the tax and 55 per cent (of the second hundred) by means of exchange. 
 The task of the food supply worker now becomes more complicated. 
 Onthe one hand, it is a fiscal task: collect the tax as quicklyand as efficiently as possible. 
 On the other hand, it is ageneral economic task: try to direct the co-operatives,assist small industry, develop local initiative in such a way as to increase the exchange between agriculture and industry and put it on a sound basis. 
 Our bureaucratic practicesprove that we are still doing a very bad job of it. 
 We mustnot be afraid to admit that in this respect we still have a great deal to learn from the capitalist . 
 We shall compare the practical experience of the various gubernias, uyezds, vo-losts and villages: in one place private capitalists, big and small, have achieved so much; those are their approximateprofits. 
 That is the tribute, the fee, we have to pay forthe “schooling”. 
 We shall not mind paying for it if welearn a thing or two. 
 That much has been achieved in aneighbouring locality through co-operation. 
 Those are the profits of the co-operatives. 
 And in a third place, that much has been achieved by purely state and communist methods(for the present, this third case will be a rare exception). 
 It should be the primary task of every regional economic centre and economic conference of the gubernia executivecommittees immediately to organise various experiments, or systems of “exchange” for the surplus stocks remaining after the tax in kind has been paid. 
 In a few months’ timepractical results must be obtained for comparison and study. 
 Local or imported salt; paraffin oil from the nearest town; the handicraft wood-working industry; handicrafts using local raw materials and producing certain, perhaps not very important, but necessary and useful, articles for the peas-ants; “green coal” (the utilisation of small local water powerresources for electrification), and so on and so forth—allthis must be brought into play in order to stimulate ex-change between industry and agriculture at all costs. 
 Those who achieve the best results in this sphere, even by means of private capitalism, even without the co-operatives, orwithout directly transforming this capitalism into statecapitalism, will do more for the cause of socialist construc-tion in Russia than those who “ponder over” the purityof communism, draw up regulations, rules and instructions for state capitalism and the co-operatives, but do nothing practical to stimulate trade. 
 Isn’t it paradoxical that private capital should be helping socialism? Not at all. 
 It is, indeed, an irrefutable economic fact. 
 Since this is a small-peasant country with transport in an extreme state of dislocation, a country emerging from war and blockade under the political guidance of the proletar-iat—which controls the transport system and large-scaleindustry—it inevitably follows, first, that at the presentmoment local exchange acquires first-class significance, and,second, that there is a possibility of assisting socialism by means of private capitalism (not to speak of state capitalism). 
 Let’s not quibble about words. 
 We still have too much of that sort of thing. 
 We must have more variety in practicalexperience and make a wider study of it. 
 In certain circum-stances, the exemplary organisation of local work, even on the smallest scale, is of far greater national importance than many branches of central state work. 
 These are precisely thecircumstances now prevailing in peasant farming in general,and in regard to the exchange of the surplus products ofagriculture for industrial goods in particular. 
 Exemplaryorganisation in this respect, even in a single volost, is of far greater national importance than the “exemplary” improvement of the central apparatus of any People’sCommissariat; over the past three and a half years our central apparatus has been built up to such an extent that it has managed to acquire a certain amount of harmful routine; we cannot improve it quickly to any extent, we do not know how to do it. 
 Assistance in the work of radically improvingit, securing an influx of fresh forces, combatingbureaucratic practices effectively and overcoming thisharmful routine must come from the localities and thelower ranks, with the model organisation of a “complex”, even if on a small scale. 
 I say “complex”, meaning not just one farm, one branch of industry, or one factory, but a totality of economic relations, a totality of economic exchange, even if only in a small locality. 
 Those of us who are doomed to remain at work in the centre will continue the task of improving the apparatus and purging it of bureaucratic evils, even if only on a modest and immediately achievable scale. 
 But the greatestassistance in this task is coming, and will come, from thelocalities. 
 Generally speaking, as far as I can observe,things are better in the localities than at the centre;and this is understandable, for, naturally, the evils of bureaucracy are concentrated at the centre. 
 In this respect, Moscow cannot but be the worst city, and in general theworst “locality”, in the Republic. 
 In the localities we havedeviations from the average to the good and the bad sides,the latter being less frequent than the former. 
 The devia-tions towards the bad side are the abuses committed by former government officials, landowners, bourgeois and other scum who play up to the Communists and who sometimescommit abominable outrages and acts of tyranny againstthe peasantry. 
 This calls for a terrorist purge, summarytrial and the firing squad. 
 Let the Martovs, the Chernovs,and non-Party philistines like them, beat their breasts and exclaim: “I thank Thee, Lord, that I am not as ‘these’, and have never accepted terrorism. 
” These sim-pletons “do not accept terrorism” because they choose tobe servile accomplices of the whiteguards in fooling theworkers and peasants. 
 The Socialist-Revolutionaries andMensheviks “do not accept terrorism” because under the flag of “socialism” they are fulfilling their function of placing the masses at the mercy of the whiteguard terrorism . 
 This was proved by the Kerensky regime and the Kornilov putsch in Russia, by the Kolchak regime in Siberia, and by Menshevism in Georgia. 
 It was proved by the heroes of the Second International and of the “Two-and-a-Half”110 International in Finland, Hungary, Austria, Germany, Italy, Britain, etc. 
 Let the flunkey accomplices of whiteguardterrorism wallow in their repudiation of all terrorism. 
 We shallspeak the bitter and indubitable truth: in countries besetby an unprecedented crisis, the collapse of old ties, and the intensification of the class struggle after the imperialist war of 1914-18—and that means all the countries of theworld—terrorism cannot be dispensed with, notwithstandingthe hypocrites and phrase-mongers. 
 Either the whiteguard,bourgeois terrorism of the American, British (Ireland),Italian (the fascists), German, Hungarian and other types, or Red, proletarian terrorism. 
 There is no middle course, no “third” course, nor can there be any. 
 The deviations towards the good side are the success achieved in combating the evils of bureaucracy, the greatattention shown for the needs of the workers and peasants,and the great care in developing the economy, raising the productivity of labour and stimulating local exchange between agriculture and industry. 
 Although the good exam-ples are more numerous than the bad ones, they are, never-theless, rare. 
 Still, they are there. 
 Young, fresh communistforces, steeled by civil war and privation, are comingforward in all localities. 
 We are still doing far too little to promote these forces regularly from lower to higher posts. 
 This can and must be done more persistently, and on awider scale than at present. 
 Some workers can and should betransferred from work at the centre to local work. 
 As lead-ing men of uyezds, and of volosts , where they can organise economic work as a whole on exemplary lines, they will do far more good, and perform work of far greater national importance, than by performing some junction at the centre. 
The exemplary organisation of the work will help to trainnew workers and provide examples that other districtscould follow with relative ease. 
 We at the centre shall be ableto do a great deal to encourage the other districts all over the country to “follow” the good examples, and even make it mandatory for them to do so. 
 By its very nature, the work of developing “exchange” between agriculture and industry, the exchange of after-tax surpluses for the output of small, mainly handicraft, industry, calls for independent, competent and intelligent local initiative. 
 That is why it is now extremely importantfrom the national standpoint to organise the work in theuyezds and volosts on exemplary lines. 
 In military affairs,during the last Polish war, for example, we were not afraidof departing from the bureaucratic hierarchy, “downgrad-ing”, or transferring members of the Revolutionary Mili-tary Council of the Republic to lower posts (while allowingthem to retain their higher rank at the centre). 
 Why notnow transfer several members of the All-Russia CentralExecutive Committee, or members of collegiums, or otherhigh-ranking comrades, to uyezd or even volost work? Surely, we have not become so “bureaucratised” as to “be ashamed” of that. 
 And we shall find scores of workers inthe central bodies who will be glad to accept. 
 The economicdevelopment of the whole Republic will gain enormously;and the exemplary volosts, or uyezds, will play not onlya great, but a positively crucial and historic role. 
 Incidentally, we should note as a small but significant circumstance the necessary change in our attitude to theproblem of combating profiteering. 
 We must foster “proper”trade, which is one that does not evade state control; itis to our advantage to develop it. 
 But profiteering, in itspolitico-economic sense, cannot be distinguished from “proper” trade. 
 Freedom of trade is capitalism; capitalism is profiteering. 
 It would be ridiculous to ignore this. 
 What then should be done? Shall we declare profiteering to be no longer punishable? No. 
 We must revise and redraft all the laws on profiteer-ing, and declare all pilfering and every direct or indirect, open or concealed evasion of state control , supervision and accounting to be a punishable offence (and in fact prosecuted with redoubled severity). 
 It is by presenting the questionin this way (the Council of People’s Commissars has alreadystarted, that is to say, it has ordered that work be started,on the revision of the anti-profiteering laws) that we shall succeed in directing the rather inevitable but necess-ary development of capitalism into the channels of state capitalism. 
 POLITICAL SUMMARY AND DEDUCTIONS I still have to deal, if briefly, with the political situa-tion, and the way it has taken shape and changed in connectionwith the economic developments outlined above. 
 I have already said that the fundamental features of our economy in 1921 are the same as those in 1918. 
 Thespring of 1921, mainly as a result of the crop failure and the loss of cattle, brought a sharp deterioration in the con-dition of the peasantry, which was bad enough because of thewar and blockade. 
 This resulted in political vacillationswhich, generally speaking, express the very “nature” ofthe small producer. 
 Their most striking expression was theKronstadt mutiny. 
 The vacillation of the petty-bourgeois element was the most characteristic feature of the Kronstadt events. 
 Therewas very little that was clear, definite and fully shaped. 
We heard nebulous slogans about “freedom”, “freedom totrade”, “emancipation”, “Soviets without the Bolsheviks”,or new elections to the Soviets, or relief from “Party dic-tatorship”, and so on and so forth. 
 Both the Mensheviks and the Socialist-Revolutionaries declared the Kronstadtmovement to be “their own”. 
 Victor Chernov sent a messen-ger to Kronstadt. 
 On the latter’s proposal, the MenshevikValk, one of the Kronstadt leaders, voted for the Constitu-ent Assembly . 
 In a flash, with lightning speed, you might say, the whiteguards mobilised all their forces “ for Kron-stadt ”. 
 Their military experts in Kronstadt, a number of experts, and not Kozlovsky alone, drew up a plan fora landing at Oranienbaum, which scared the vacillatingmass of Mensheviks, Socialist-Revolutionaries and non-party elements. 
 More than fifty Russian whiteguard news-papers published abroad conducted a rabid campaign “for Kronstadt ”. 
 The big banks, all the forces of finance capital, collected funds to assist Kronstadt. 
 That shrewdleader of the bourgeoisie and the landowners, the CadetMilyukov, patiently explained to the simpleton VictorChernov directly (and to the Mensheviks Dan and Rozhkov, who are in jail in Petrograd for their connection with the Kronstadt events, indirectly) that there is noneed to hurry with the Constituent Assembly, and that Soviet power can and must be supported— only without the Bolsheviks. 
 Of course, it is easy to be cleverer than conceited simple-tons like Chernov, the petty-bourgeois phrase-monger,or like Martov, the knight of philistine reformism doctoredto pass for Marxism. 
 Properly speaking, the point is not thatMilyukov, as an individual, has more brains, but that,because of his class position, the party leader of the big bour-geoisie sees and understands the class essence and political interaction of things more clearly than the leaders of thepetty bourgeoisie, the Chernovs and Martovs. 
 For thebourgeoisie is really a class force which, under capitalism,inevitably rules both under a monarchy and in the mostdemocratic republic, and which also inevitably enjoys the support of the world bourgeoisie. 
 But the petty bourgeoi-sie, i. 
e. 
, all the heroes of the Second International and ofthe “Two-and-a-Half” International, cannot, by the veryeconomic nature of things, be anything else than the ex-pression of class impotence; hence the vacillation, phrase-mongering and helplessness. 
 In 1789, the petty bourgeois could still be great revolutionaries. 
 In 1848, they were ridiculous and pathetic. 
 Their actual role in 1917-21 isthat of abominable agents and out-and-out servitors ofreaction, be their names Chernov, Martov, Kautsky, Mac-Donald, or what have you. 
 Martov showed himself to be nothing but a philistine Narcissus when he declared in his Berlin journal 111 that Kronstadt not only adopted Menshevik slogans but alsoproved that there could be an anti-Bolshevik movementwhich did not entirely serve the interests of the whiteguards,the capitalists and the landowners. 
 He says in effect: “Letus shut our eves to the fact that all the genuine white-guards hailed the Kronstadt mutineers and collected funds in aid of Kronstadt through the banks!” Compared withthe Chernovs and Martovs, Milyukov is right, for he isrevealing the true tactics of the real whiteguard force, the force of the capitalists and landowners. 
 He declares:“It does not matter whom we support, be they anarchists or any sort of Soviet government, as long as the Bolsheviks are overthrown, as long as there is a shift in power ; it does not matter whether to the right or to the left, to the Mensheviks or to the anarchists, as long as it is away from the Bolsheviks. 
 As for the rest—‘we’, the Milyukovs, ‘we’, the capitalists and landowners, will do the rest ‘ourselves’; we shall slap down the anarchist pygmies, the Chernovsand the Martovs, as we did Chernov and Maisky in Siberia,the Hungarian Chernovs and Martovs in Hungary, Kautskyin Germany and the Friedrich Adlers and Co. 
 in Vienna. 
”The real, hard-headed bourgeoisie have made fools of hundreds of these philistine Narcissuses—whether Menshevik, Socialist-Revolutionary or non-party—and have driventhem out scores of times in all revolutions in all countries. 
History proves it. 
 The facts bear it out. 
 The Narcissuseswill talk; the Milyukovs and whiteguards will act. 
 Milyukov is absolutely right when he says, “If only there is a power shift away from the Bolsheviks, no matter whether it is a little to the right or to the left, the restwill take care of itself. 
” This is class truth, confirmed bythe history of revolutions in all countries, and by thecenturies of modern history since the Middle Ages. 
 The scat-tered small producers, the peasants, are economically and politically united either by the bourgeoisie (this has always been—and will always be—the case under capitalism inall countries, in all modern revolutions), or by the prole-tariat (that was the case in a rudimentary form for a veryshort period at the peak of some of the greatest revolutionsin modern history; that has been the case in Russia in a more developed form in 1917-21). 
 Only the Narcissuses will talk and dream about a “third” path, and a “thirdforce”. 
 With enormous difficulty, and in the course of desperate struggles, the Bolsheviks have trained a proletarian van-guard that is capable of governing; they have created and successfully defended the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
 After the test of four years of practical experience, therelation of class forces in Russia has become as clear asday: the steeled and tempered vanguard of the only revo-lutionary class; the vacillating petty-bourgeois element;and the Milyukovs, the capitalists and landowners, lying in wait abroad and supported by the world bourgeoisie. 
 It is crystal-clear: only the latter are able to take advan-tage of any “shift of power “, and will certainly do so. 
 In the 1918 pamphlet I quoted above, this point was put very clearly: “the principal enemy” is the “petty-bour-geois element”. 
 “Either we subordinate it to our control and accounting, or it will overthrow the workers’ poweras surely and as inevitably as the revolution was over-thrown by the Napoleons and the Cavaignacs whosprang from this very soil of petty proprietorship. 
 Thisis how the question stands. 
 That is the only view we can take of the matter. 
” (Excerpt from the pamphlet of May 5, 1918, cf. 
 above. 
) Our strength lies in complete clarity and the sober con-sideration of all the existing class magnitudes, both Russian and international; and in the inexhaustible energy, ironresolve and devotion in struggle that arise from this. 
 We have many enemies, but they are disunited, or do not know their own minds (like all the petty bourgeoisie, all theMartovs and Chernovs, all the non-party elements andanarchists). 
 But we are united—directly among ourselvesand indirectly with the proletarians of all countries; weknow just what we want. 
 That is why we are invincible on a world scale, although this does not in the least preclude the possibility of defeat for individual proletarian revolu-tions for longer or shorter periods. 
 There is good reason for calling the petty-bourgeois element an element, for it is indeed something that ismost amorphous, indefinite and unconscious. 
 The petty-bourgeois Narcissuses imagine that “universal suffrage” abolishes the nature of the small producer under capital-ism. 
 As a matter of fact, it helps the bourgeoisie, through the church, the press, the teachers, the police, the mili-tarists and a thousand and one forms of economic oppression,to subordinate the scattered small producers. 
 Ruin, want and the hard conditions of life give rise to vacillation: one day for the bourgeoisie, the next, for the proletariat. 
 Onlythe steeled proletarian vanguard is capable of withstandingand overcoming this vacillation. 
 The events of the spring of 1921 once again revealed the role of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks: they help the vacillating petty-bourgeois element to recoil from the Bolsheviks, to cause a “shift of power” in favourof the capitalists and landowners. 
 The Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries have now learned to don the “non-party ” disguise . 
 This has been fully proved. 
 Only fools now fail to see this and understand that we must not allow ourselves to be fooled. 
 Non-Party conferences arenot a fetish. 
 They are valuable if they help us to comecloser to the impassive masses—the millions of workingpeople still outside politics. 
 They are harmful if theyprovide a platform for the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries masquerading as “non-party” men. 
 They are helping the mutinies, and the whiteguards. 
 The place forMensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, avowed or innon-party guise, is not at a non-Party conference but in prison(or on foreign journals, side by side with the white-guards; we were glad to let Martov go abroad). 
 We can and must find other methods of testing the mood of the masses and coming closer to them. 
 We suggest that thosewho want to play the parliamentary, constituent assemblyand non-Party conference game, should go abroad; overthere, by Martov’s side, they can try the charms of “democ-racy” and ask Wrangel’s soldiers about them. 
 We have no time for this “opposition” at “conferences” game. 
 We are surrounded by the world bourgeoisie, who are watchingfor every sign of vacillation in order to bring back “theirown men”, and restore the landowners and the bourgeoisie. 
We will keep in prison the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, whether avowed or in “non-party” guise. 
 We shall employ every means to establish closer contacts with the masses of working people untouched by politics—except such means as give scope to the Mensheviks andSocialist-Revolutionaries, and the vacillations that benefit Milyukov . 
 In particular, we shall zealously draw into Soviet work, primarily economic work, hundreds upon hundreds of non-Party people, real non-Party people from the masses, the rank and file of workers and peasants, andnot those who have adopted non-party colours in order tocrib Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary instructionswhich are so much to Milyukov’s advantage. 
 Hundredsand thousands of non-Party people are working for us, and scores occupy very important and responsible posts. 
 We must pay more attention to the way they work. 
 We mustdo more to promote and test thousands and thousands of rank-and-file workers, to try them out systematically and persistently, and appoint hundreds of them to higher posts, if experience shows that they can fill them. 
 Our Communists still do not have a sufficient understand-ing of their real duties of administration: they should notstrive to do “everything themselves”, running themselvesdown and failing to cope with everything, undertakingtwenty jobs and finishing none. 
 They should check up on the work of scores and hundreds of assistants, arrange to have their work checked up from below, i. 
e. 
, by the realmasses. 
 They should direct the work and learn from those who have the knowledge (the specialists) and the experiencein organising large-scale production (the capitalists). 
 Theintelligent Communist will not be afraid to learn from the military expert, although nine-tenths of the military experts are capable of treachery at every opportunity. 
 Thewise Communist will not be afraid to learn from a capital-ist (whether a big capitalist concessionaire, a commissionagent, or a petty capitalist co-operator, etc. 
), althoughthe capitalist is no better than the military expert. 
 Did we not learn to catch treacherous military experts in the Red Army, to bring out the honest and conscientious, and,on the whole, to utilise thousands and tens of thousandsof military experts? We are learning to do the same thing(in an unconventional way) with engineers and teachers,although we are not doing it as well as we did it in the Red Army (there Denikin and Kolchak spurred us on, compelled us to learn more quickly, diligently and intelli-gently). 
 We shall also learn to do it (again in an unconven-tional way) with the commission agents, with the buyersworking for the state, the petty capitalist co-operators,the entrepreneur concessionaires, etc. 
 The condition of the masses of workers and peasants needs to be improved right away. 
 And we shall achievethis by putting new forces, including non-Party forces,to useful work. 
 The tax in kind, and a number of measuresconnected with it, will facilitate this; we shall thereby cutat the economic root of the small producer’s inevitable vacillations. 
 And we shall ruthlessly fight the political vacillations, which benefit no one but Milyukov. 
 The wa-verers are many, we are few. 
 The waverers are disunited, we are united. 
 The waverers are not economically independ-ent, the proletariat is. 
 The waverers don’t know their own minds: they want to do something very badly, but Milyukov won’t let them. 
 We know what we want. 
 And that is why we shall win. 
 CONCLUSION To sum up. 
The tax in kind is a transition from War Communism to a regular socialist exchange of products. 
 The extreme ruin rendered more acute by the crop failure in 1920 has made this transition urgently necessary owingto the fact that it was impossible to restore large-scale industry rapidly. 
 Hence, the first thing to do is to improve the condition of the peasants. 
 The means are the tax in kind, thedevelopment of exchange between agriculture and industry,and the development of small industry. 
 Exchange is freedom of trade; it is capitalism. 
 It is use-ful to us inasmuch as it will help us overcome the dispersal of the small producer, and to a certain degree combatthe evils of bureaucracy; to what extent this can be donewill be determined by practical experience. 
 The proletarianpower is in no danger, as long as the proletariat firmlyholds power in its hands, and has full control of transport and large-scale industry. 
 The fight against profiteering must be transformed into a fight against stealing and the evasion of state supervi-sion, accounting and control. 
 By means of this controlwe shall direct the capitalism that is to a certain extentinevitable and necessary for us into the channels of state capitalism. 
 The development of local initiative and independent action in encouraging exchange between agriculture andindustry must be given the fullest scope at all costs. 
 Thepractical experience gained must be studied; and thisexperience must be made as varied as possible. 
 We must give assistance to small industry servicing peasant farming and helping to improve it. 
 To some extent,this assistance may be given in the form of raw materials from the state stocks. 
 It would be most criminal to leave these raw materials unprocessed. 
 We must not be afraid of Communists “learning” from bourgeois experts, including merchants, petty capitalistco-operators and capitalists, in the same way as we learnedfrom the military experts, though in a different form. 
The results of the “learning” must be tested only by practi-cal experience and by doing things better than the bour-geois experts at your side; try in every way to secure an improvement in agriculture and industry, and to developexchange between them. 
 Do not grudge them the “tuition”fee: none will be too high, provided we learn something. 
 Do everything to help the masses of working people, to come closer to them, and to promote from their ranks hun-dreds and thousands of non-Party people for the work of economic administration. 
 As for the “non-party” peoplewho are only Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionariesdisguised in fashionable non-party attire à la Kronstadt, they should be kept safe in prison, or packed off to Berlin,to join Martov in freely enjoying all the charms of pure democracy and freely exchanging ideas with Chernov, Milyukov and the Georgian Mensheviks. 
 April 21, 1921 Published in pamphlet form Published according in May 1921 to the pamphlet text collated with the manuscript RECORDE D SPEECH ES112 1 THE TAX IN KIND The surplus-food appropriation system has been replaced by a tax in kind. 
 The All-Russia Central Executive Com-mittee has issued a decree to that effect. 
 In pursuance of this decree, the Council of People’s Commissars has issueda law introducing the tax in kind. 
 113 It is now the duty of all Soviet institutions to inform the peasants of the lawas broadly as possible and explain what it means. 
 Why was it necessary to substitute a tax in kind for the surplus-grain appropriation system? It is because thesurplus appropriation system proved to be extremely in-convenient and onerous for the peasants, whose want and ruinwere further aggravated by the 1920 crop failure. 
 Further-more, the fodder shortage led to greater loss of cattle; lessfirewood was transported from the forests; and there was a slowdown in the factories producing the goods to be exchanged for the peasants’ grain. 
 The workers’ andpeasants’ government had to take steps immediately toalleviate the condition of the peasants. 
 The tax in kind amounts to only about one-half of the surplus-grain appropriation rate: grain, for example, will amount to 240 million poods instead of 423 million. 
 Every peasant will know the exact amount of tax he has to paybeforehand, that is, in the spring. 
 This will reduce theabuses in tax collection. 
 It will be an incentive for thepeasant to cultivate a larger area, to improve his farm, andtry to raise yields. 
 This country has been devastated unbelievably first by the tsarist war, and then by the Civil War, that is, by thelandowners’ and capitalists’ invasion against the Soviet power of workers and peasants. 
 The national economy must be put on its feet at all costs. 
 And the first thing to do is to restore, consolidate and improve peasant farming. 
 The tax in kind will help to improve peasant farming. 
 The peasants will now set to work on their farms with great-er confidence and with a will, and that is the main thing.

 Lenin First published in 1926 Published according to the manuscript 2 CONCESSIONS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF CAPITALISM The Soviet government is inviting foreign capitalists to obtain concessions in Russia. 
 What is a concession? It is a contract between the govern-ment and a capitalist who undertakes to organise or im-prove production (for example, felling and floating timber,extracting coal, oil, ore, etc. 
) and to pay the governmenta share of the product obtained, keeping the rest as hisprofit. 
 Is it right for the Soviet government to invite foreign capitalists after expelling the Russian landowners andcapitalists? Yes, it is, because, seeing that the workers’revolution in other countries is delayed, we have to makesome sacrifices in order to achieve a rapid and even imme-diate improvement in the condition of the workers and peasants. 
 The sacrifice is that over a number of years we shall be giving away to the capitalists tens of millions ofpoods of valuable products. 
 The improvement in thecondition of the workers and peasants is that we shall imme-diately obtain additional quantities of petroleum, paraffinoil, salt, coal, farming implements, and so forth. 
 We have no right to forego the opportunity of immediately improv-ing the condition of the workers and peasants, for ourimpoverishment makes it essential, and our sacrifices willnot be fatal. 
 But is it not dangerous to invite the capitalists? Does it not imply a development of capitalism? Yes, it does imply a development of capitalism, but this is not danger-ous, because power will still be in the hands of the workersand peasants, and the landowners and capitalists will not be getting back their property. 
 A concession is something in the nature of a contract of lease. 
 The capitalist becomes, for a specified period, the lessee of a certain part of state property under a contract, but he does not becomethe owner. 
 The state remains the owner. 
 The Soviet government will see to it that the capitalist lessee abides by the terms of the contract, that the contractis to our advantage, and that, as a result, the condition of the workers and peasants is improved. 
 On these terms the development of capitalism is not dangerous, and theworkers and peasants stand to gain by obtaining a largerquantity of products.

 Lenin First published in 1924 Published according to the manuscript 3 CONSUMERS’ AND PRODUCERS’ CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETIES Consumers’ co-operative societies are associations of workers and peasants for the purpose of supplying anddistributing the goods they need. 
 Producers’ co-operativesocieties are associations of small farmers or artisans forthe purpose of producing and marketing products, whetheragricultural (such as vegetables, dairy produce and the like) or non-agricultural (all sorts of manufactured goods, woodwork, ironware, leather goods, and so forth). 
 The substitution of the tax in kind for the surplus appro-priation system will give the peasants grain surpluses whichthey will freely exchange for all sorts of manufactured goods. 
 Producers’ co-operatives will help to develop small industry, which will supply the peasants with greater quantities of necessary goods. 
 Most of these do not haveto be transported by rail over long distances and do notneed large factories for their manufacture. 
 Everything mustbe done to foster and develop producers’ co-operatives,and it is the duty of Party and Soviet workers to render them every assistance, for this will give the peasants imme-diate relief and improve their condition. 
 At the presenttime, the revival and restoration of the national economyof the workers’ and peasants’ state depends most of all onthe improvement of peasant life and farming. 
 There must also be support and development of consum-ers’ co-operative societies, for they will ensure swift, regular and low-cost distribution of products. 
 It remains for theSoviet authorities to supervise the activity of the co-operative societies to see that there are no fraudulent prac-tices, no concealment from the government, no abuses. 
In no circumstances should they hamper the co-operative societies but should help and promote them in every way. 
 Written on April 25, 1921 Published according to a First published in 1924transcript from the record TO COMRADE KRZHIZHANOVSKY, THE PRESIDIUM OF THE STATE PLANNING COMMISSION There is still hardly any evidence of the operation of an integrated state economic plan. 
 The predominating tendency is to “revive” everything, all branches of the national economy indiscriminately, even all the enter-prises that we have inherited from capitalism. 
 The State Planning Commission should organise its work in such a way as to have drawn up, at least by harvesttime, the main principles of a state economic plan for the next year or two. 
 It should start with food, for this is the taproot of all our difficulties. 
 An attempt must be made to draw up a nation-al economic plan for three contingencies: a state reserveof (1) 200; (2) 250 and (3) 300 million poods of grain forthe year (September 1, 1921 to September 1, 1922). 
 Perhaps, if the difficulties of working out detailed calculations for the three contingencies prove too great, it would bemore rational to confine ourselves to one detailed calcula-tion based on the assumption that we obtain 250 millionpoods, with a surplus (300 minus 250) provided againsta rainy day, and only approximate the details for the contingency of a complete shortage of grain (200 million poods) (so much to be bought from abroad, so much to be “tightened up” in industry, transport, the army, etc. 
). 
 Assume that the state grain reserve amounts to so much; deduct a reserve for the contingency of war, interruptionsin railway communication, etc. 
 Then comes fuel. 
 The prospects ranging from so much to so much. 
 Minimum and maximum amount of foodrequired for this purpose. 
 The possibility of increasing fuel supplies to such -and-such dimensions if the grain reserve is increased by so much. 
 Possibility of economising so much fuel by concentrat-ing production in a few of the best factories. 
 These cal-culations are essential. 
 In this connection, estimate thepossibilities of economising food by closing down unneces-sary factories, or those not absolutely essential, and bytransferring the workers (Where? Is such transfer feasible? If not—consider the minimum task of putting such workers on shorter rations). 
 Economising fuel by paying a bonus for saving it and by tighter supervision of consumption. 
 Approximate esti-mate of such economy—if there are any data to base it on. 
 The army (as distinct from the navy, for which special calculations must be made for maximum reduction, verging on abolition, and reduction of expenditure). 
 Basis of cal-culation—1. 
6 million by Sept. 
 1, 1921, and a provisionalestimate for half the amount. 
 Soviet office staffs. 
 Present size. 
 Possibility of reducing by 25 or 50 per cent. 
 Bonus for one-fourth (of present num-ber of employees, those absolutely essential) for reducing the total number. 
 This question of giving a bonus to theremaining fourth (or third, or half) for reducing the totalnumber of mouths (and for reducing fuel consumption by,say, introducing a three-shift system and closing two outof three offices) must be examined with particular care in view of its exceptional importance. 
 Industry, divided into several groups with the smallest possible number of the main groups. 
 Water and light. 
Minimum necessary to cover minimum requirements:(α) productive consumption, ( β) individual consumption. 
 Estimates for a definite number of main groups (the task of working out detailed calculations for the respective branches of industry, districts and towns may, perhaps,be assigned to special subcommissions, or special localagents, or to the gubernia statistical bureaus, etc. 
)—calculate how many large factories all production can beconcentrated in, and how many should be closed. 
 Obviously, this extremely important question requires particularly careful study: firstly, purely statistical (data for 1920,and, if possible, also for 1918 and 1919; sometimes, in exceptional cases, pre-war statistics may be of auxiliary use); secondly, economic, which must solve the following special problem: Is it possible to find for the redundant urban and indus-trial workers whom the state ought not to feed, and forwhom other employment cannot be provided in the towns,temporary employment—for a year or two—in the graindistricts on the understanding that they satisfy the needs of the surrounding farming population? After industry, from which the building industry must be singled out, comes transport (perhaps this should beput before industry?), and electrification as a distinct item. 
 And so forth. 
The estimates must be first drawn up at least in rough outline, as a first approximation; but they must be ready at an early date—within a month, or two, at the outside. 
They must give an overall picture of the total food andfuel expenditure for the year. 
 This rough plan can after-wards be filled in, corrected, amended; but at this earlydate we must have the main plan for the year even if only in rough outline (or perhaps separate plans for each of the quarters, or thirds, of the year: Sept. 
 1, 1921 to Jan. 
 1,1922; Jan. 
 1 to May 1, and May 1 to Sept. 
 1, 1922). 
 Nineteen-twenty must be taken as a basis for comparison throughout. 
 Perhaps a number of estimates can and must bemade on the basis of a comparative statistical and economic study of the data for 1920 and the “prospects” for 1921-22. 
 I request that the Presidium of the State Planning Commission inform me of the opinions on this letter ofthe majority and of its individual members, beforesubmitting my proposal to the Plenum of the State PlanningCommission. 
 Chairman of the Council of Labour and Defence, V.

 1) Special attention must be paid to the industries producing articles that can be exchanged for grain, in order to obtain grain within the country. 
 At all events these industries must be grouped separately so as to providea definite answer to the question: In the event of a general shortage of grain, will it be possible, by setting aside a given quantity of food and fuel for certain branches of industry, or certain factories, to obtain a given quantity of goods which can be exchanged for a given quantity ofgrain? This provisional estimate must be drawn up before-hand, for application, in certain cases, after the harvest. 
 2) An attempt must be made to single out and count up: (a) the factories (and number of workers) that are abso-lutely essential for the state and (b) the factories—and num-ber of workers—which are being kept running by tradition,routine, and the unwillingness of the workers to changetheir occupation and domicile, etc. 
, and which shouldbe closed down to rationalise production and concentrateindustry in a few of the best factories operating in several shifts. 
 Total number of factories and workers in each category. 
 Estimate reduction of ration for second categoryas an incentive for closing these factories. 
 First published in 1923 Published according to the manuscript INSTRUCTIONS OF THE COUNCI L OF LABOU R AND DEFENCE TO LOCAL SOVIET BODIE S114 DRAFT The primary task of the Soviet Republic is to restore the productive forces and revive agriculture, industry and transport. 
 The ruin and impoverishment caused everywhere by the imperialist war are so vast that an economic crisis is raging throughout the world, and even in the advancedcountries, which before the war were way ahead of Russiain their development and which suffered much less fromthe war than she did, economic rehabilitation is proceed-ing with enormous difficulty and will take many long years. 
 This situation prevails even in many of the “victor” coun-tries, despite the fact that they are allied with the richestcapitalist powers and are exacting a fat tribute from thedefeated, dependent and colonial countries. 
 Backward Russia, which in addition to the imperialist war endured more than three years of civil war, imposed upon the workers and peasants by the landowners and capi-talists with the help of the world bourgeoisie, naturallyfinds the difficulties of economic rehabilitation so muchmore formidable. 
 The heavy crop failure in 1920, the lackof fodder and the loss of cattle have had a disastrous effecton peasant farming. 
 In conformity with the law passed by the All-Russia Central Executive Committee, a tax in kind has beensubstituted for the surplus appropriation system. 
 Thefarmer is free to exchange his surplus produce for variousgoods. 
 The tax rates have been announced by order ofthe Council of People’s Commissars. 
 The tax amounts to approximately one-half of the produce obtained under the surplus appropriation system. 
 The Council of People’sCommissars has issued a new law on the co-operative societies giving them wider powers in view of the free exchange of surplus farm produce. 
 These laws have done a great deal for the immediate improvement of the condition of peasant farming andstimulation of peasant interest in enlarging the area undercrop and improving methods of farming and livestock breed-ing. 
 They have also done much to help revive and developsmall local industry which can do without the procure-ment and transportation of large state stocks of food, raw materials and fuel. 
 Particularly great importance now attaches to independent local initiative in improving peasant farming,developing industry and establishing exchange betweenagriculture and industry. 
 Great opportunities are being created for the application of new forces and fresh energy to the work of restoring the country’s economy. 
 The Council of Labour and Defence, upon whom, in pur-suance of the decision of the Eighth All-Russia Congressof Soviets, devolves the duty of co-ordinating and directingthe activity of the People’s Commissariats for the various sectors of the economy, insistently urges all local bodies to do their utmost to develop extensive activities for theall-round improvement of peasant farming and the revivalof industry, in strict conformity with the new laws andin the light of the fundamental propositions and instructionsgiven below. 
 We now have two main criteria of success in our work of economic development on a nation-wide scale. 
 Firstsuccess in the speedy, full and, from the state point ofview, proper collection of the tax in kind; and second—and this is particularly important—success in the exchangeof manufactured goods for agricultural produce between industry and agriculture. 
 This is most vital, urgent and imperative. 
 It will put all our efforts to the test and lay the foundations forimplementing our great electrification plan, which willresult in the restoration of our large-scale industry andtransport to such proportions and on such a technical basis that we shall overcome starvation and poverty once and for all. 
 We must collect 100 per cent of the tax in kind, and, in addition, an equal quantity of food products through the First page of Lenin’s “Instructions of the Council of Labour and Defence to Local Soviet Bodies. 
 Draft. 
” May 1921 Reduced First page of Lenin’s “Instructions of the Council of Labour and Defence to Local Soviet Bodies. 
 Draft. 
” May 1921 Reduced free exchange of surplus farm produce for manufactured goods. 
 Of course, this will not be achieved everywhere all at once, but it should be our short-term goal. 
 We can achieve it in a very short time if we take the right view of the stateof our economy and put our hearts into reviving it the rightway. 
 All local authorities and bodies in every gubernia,uyezd, regional centre and autonomous republic must joinforces and co-ordinate their efforts to stimulate the exchange of surplus produce. 
 Experience will show how far we can do this by increasing the output and delivery of goods madeby the state in the big socialist factories. 
 It will show howfar we succeed in encouraging and developing small localindustry, and what part will be played in this by the co-operative societies and the private traders, manufacturers and capitalists who are under state control. 
 We must try out every method, giving the utmost scope to local initia-tive. 
 The new task before us has never been tackledanywhere else before. 
 We are trying to solve it in the condi-tions of post-war ruin, which prevent any precise estimationof our resources or of the effort we can expect of the workers and peasants, who have made such incredible sacrifices to defeat the landowners and capitalists. 
 We must bebolder in widely applying a variety of methods and takingdifferent approaches, giving rein to capital and privatetrade in varying degree, without being afraid to implantsome capitalism, as long as we succeed in stimulating ex-change at once and thereby revive agriculture and industry. 
 We must ascertain the country’s resources by practicalexperience, and determine the best way to improve thecondition of the workers and peasants to enable us to pro-ceed with the wider and more fundamental work of build-ing up the economy and implementing the electrification plan. 
 The two main questions to which every Soviet official engaged in economic work must pay attention are: how muchof their surplus farm produce, over and above the tax,have the peasants exchanged for the manufactures of smallindustry and private trade, and how much for manufacturedgoods provided by the state? These are the main lines to follow over the short haul in order to achieve the greatest results. 
 They will provide the success indicators and enableus to decide on the subsequent tasks. 
 Every aspect of economic construction in general must be geared to these two immediate tasks. 
 To attain this co-ordination, encourage local initiative, enterprise and large-scale operations to the utmost, andmake sure that central bodies are guided by local experienceand local supervision, and vice versa, thereby eliminatingred tape and bureaucratic practices, the Council of Labourand Defence has ordered (see text of the order) that: first, regular economic conferences should be convened in all districts for the purpose of co-ordinating the workof the local departments of all the People’s Commissariatsfor the various sectors of the economy; second, proper records of the local economic conferences should be kept to facilitate the pooling of experience and the organising of emulation, and mainly, to utilise the work of the local organisations and its results as a means of checkingup on the methods and organisation of the central bodies. 
 The local economic conferences should be organised on the lines of the C. 
L. 
D. 
 (Council of Labour and Defence)and their relationship with the local executive committees should be similar to those between the C. 
L. 
D. 
 and the Council of People’s Commissars. 
 The C. 
L. 
D. 
 functions asa commission of the Council of People’s Commissars. 
 Theappointment of members of the Council of People’s Com-missars to the C. 
L. 
D. 
 ensures the fullest co-ordinationof the work of both bodies, eliminates the possibility of any friction between them, expedites matters and simplifies procedures. 
 Having no staff of its own, the C. 
L. 
D. 
 utilisesthat of various government departments, striving to sim-plify their procedures and co-ordinate their operations. 
 Gubernia economic councils should stand in the same relationship to the gubernia executive committees, and that is the actual trend in practice. 
 The C. 
L. 
D. 
, in confirm-ing the appointment of members and chairmen of regionaland territorial economic councils, strives to take accountof the experience of local workers and consults with themon all its confirmations. 
 The regional economic councilsmust certainly strive, and will continue to strive, to co-ordinate their work with that of the gubernia economic councils, securing their fullest co-operation, keeping theminformed and stimulating their interest. 
 This is hardly the time to try to reduce these relationships to a set of regulations, for experience is still very short and any such attempt might result in a purely bureaucratic exercise. 
 It is far more appropriate to allow practice to determineinitially the most suitable form of relationship (the C. 
L. 
D. 
worked side by side with the Council of People’s Commissarsfor about a year, virtually without a constitution). 
 Letthese forms be at first not absolutely stable: variety is desirable, useful and even necessary to enable us to make a more precise study and a fuller comparison of the varioussystems of relationships. 
 Uyezd and volost economic councils should be organised on the same lines, naturally with a lot of leeway in modi-fying the main type, that is, the executive committees may assume all the functions and duties of the economic conferences, convert their own “executive” or “economic”meetings into economic conferences, appoint (say, in thevolosts and sometimes in the uyezds) special committees oreven individuals to exercise all or some of the functions of theeconomic conferences, and so on and so forth. 
 The village committees should be the bottom rung and should operate as the lower units of the C. 
L. 
D. 
 in the rural districts. 
 The Coun-cil of People’s Commissars has already passed a law, issuedin May 1921, which gives the village committees widerpowers and defines their relationship with the villageSoviets. 
 The gubernia executive committees must draw up provisional regulations suitable for the given locality which, however, must not restrict, but give the greatest possible scope to “local” initiative in general, and that of the lowest units in particular . 
 In industrial uyezds and settlements, the district commit-tees and factory committees, or the management boards of factories, should serve as the lower units of the C. 
L. 
D. 
, depending on whether one or more branches of industry arebeing dealt with. 
 In any case, co-operation with the uyezd executive committees, volost executive committees andvillage committees in directing all local economic life is absolutely essential in one form or another. 
 Furthermore, it is exceptionally important that local organisations should submit to the C. 
L. 
D. 
 regular andprecise information on their activity, for one of our main evils is the inadequate study of practical experience, inade-quate exchange of experience and mutual control—putting orders from the centre to the test of local experience, and subjecting local work to control by the centre. 
 One of themost important means of combating bureaucratic practicesand red tape should be to check the way the laws and ordersfrom the centre are carried out locally, and this requiresthe printing of public reports, with non-Party people and peo-ple not working in the departments necessarily taking a greater hand. 
 Nashe Khozyaistvo , “the fortnightly journal of the Tver Gubernia Economic Council” (No. 
 1, April 15, 1921; No. 
 2,April 30, 1921), is evidence that the local need to study,elucidate and publicise the results of our economic expe-rience is being realised and satisfied the correct way. 
 It will not be possible, of course, to publish a journal in every gubernia, not within the next few months, at any rate;nor will it be possible everywhere to have a fortnightlyprinting of 3,000 copies, as is the case in Tver. 
 But everygubernia, and every uyezd even, can—and should—com-pile a report on local economic activities once every two months (or initially at longer intervals, by way of excep-tion) and issue it in a printing of, say, 100 to 300 copies. 
The paper and the printing facilities for such a small oper-ation will surely be found everywhere, provided we realiseits urgency and importance, and see the necessity to satisfythis need by taking the paper from many of the departments which print a mass of useless and hardly urgent material. 
 The copy could be set up in small type and printed in twocolumns (as the comrades in Tver are doing); the feasibilityand urgency of this will be quite clear if we realise thesimple truth that even a hundred copies, distributed oneto every gubernia library and all the major state libraries, will provide a source of information for the whole of Russia , which may perhaps be scanty but sure , and will serve as a record of experience. 
 These reports must be published regularly, even if in small printings, in order to maintain a proper record of experience, and actually pool it, and enlist all the promi-nent and capable organisers among the non-Party people. 
This is something we can and must do immediately. 
 When drawing up the reports, the questions put must be answered as briefly and precisely as possible. 
 The ques-tions fall into four groups, the first being those especially prominent at the present time. 
 They must be answered in every report with the maximum precision and in the greatestdetail. 
 That is particularly necessary because this groupof questions is extremely vital and urgent for most uyezdsat this very moment. 
 Other questions will come to the forefor the smaller part of the uyezds and districts, that is, the purely industrial ones. 
 The second group consists of questions which must also be answered in every report,but the answers can and should frequently be given in theform of brief summaries of reports already submitted tothe government departments concerned. 
 In all such cases,the reports to the C. 
L. 
D. 
 must give: the dates on which the reports were sent off; the departments to which they were sent; and a brief summary of the reports in figures. 
 TheC. 
L. 
D. 
 requires such reports for supervision over thevarious departments, as well as for the totals indicating theresults in food supplies, fuel, industry, and so forth. 
 Thethird group contains questions that need not be answered in every report. 
 The answers to these questions must be given initially, that is, in the first report, but subsequentreports should add only the supplementary and newinformation as it accumulates. 
 In many cases, there will benothing to report at all on these questions every two months. 
The fourth group consists of miscellaneous, supplementary questions, which are not indicated in advance; they are not formulated by the centre but arise locally. 
 This groupmust be compiled by the local bodies, and is not limitedin any-way. 
 It goes without saying that questions pertainingto state secrets (army, or such as are connected with militaryoperations, security, etc. 
) must be answered in special reports not for publication, but intended exclusively for the C. 
L. 
D. 
 as confidential reports. 
 Here is a list of these questions: FIRST GROUP OF QUESTIONS 1. 
 COMMODITY EXCHANGE WITH THE PEASANTRY At present, this question ranks first in importance and urgency. 
 First, the state cannot carry on any economicdevelopment unless the army and the urban workers have regular and adequate supplies of food; the exchange of commodities must become the principal means of collect-ing foodstuffs. 
 Secondly, commodity exchange is a test of the relationship between industry and agriculture and thefoundation of all our work to create a fairly well regulatedmonetary system. 
 All economic councils and all economicbodies must now concentrate on commodity exchange(which also includes the exchange of manufactured goods, for the manufactured goods made by socialist factories and exchanged for the foodstuffs produced by the peasantsare not commodities in the politico-economic sense of theword; at any rate, they are not only commodities, theyare no longer commodities, they are ceasing to becommodities). 
 What preparations have been made for commodity exchange? What has been done specifically to prepare forit? By the Commissariat for Food? By the co-operativesocieties? The number of co-operative shops availablefor this purpose? Are there such shops in every volost?In how many villages? Stock of goods for commodity exchange? Prices on the “free” market? Surplus stocks of grain and other farm produce? Is there any, and how much,experience in commodity exchange? Totals and results?What is being done to prevent the pilferage of goods stocksearmarked for exchange, and of food stocks (a particularlyimportant point demanding investigation of every case of pilferage)? Salt and paraffin oil as articles for commodity exchange? Textiles? Other goods? What items are needed most? Whatare the chief peasant shortages? What can be supplied bylocal, small, handicraft industry? Or by developing localindustry? Facts and figures showing how commodity exchange is organised and the results achieved are most important forthe conduct of the experiment on a country-wide scale. 
 Has the proper relationship been established between the Commissariat for Food, the body controlling and supervis-ing commodity exchange, and the co-operative societies, the bodies carrying on commodity exchange? How does this relationship operate in practice? In each locality? What part does private trade play in commodity /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR exchange? To what extent is private trade developing, or developed? Number of private traders; their turnover in the major items, particularly foodstuffs? 2. 
 THE STATE’S ATTITUDE TO THE CAPITALISTS Commodity exchange and freedom of trade inevitably imply the appearance of capitalists and capitalist relation-ships. 
 There is no reason to fear this. 
 The workers’ state has enough resources to keep within the proper bounds and control these relationships, which are useful and necessaryin conditions of small-scale production. 
 The thing to doat present is to make a close study of their dimensionsand devise suitable methods (not restrictive, or rather, not prohibitive) of state control and accountancy. 
 To what extent is private trade developing as a result of the substitution of the tax for the surplus appropriationsystem? Can it be estimated or not? Is it only profiteeringor regular trade as well? Is it registered, and if so, whatare the results? Private enterprise: have there been any offers from capitalists and entrepreneurs to lease enterprises or estab-lishments, or commercial premises? Exact number ofsuch offers and an analysis of them? How are the resultsof trading operations assessed (if only approximately)?Ditto as regards the accounts of leaseholders and commission agents, if any? Have there been any offers from commission agents? To buy produce for the state on a commission basis? Orto market and distribute it? Or to organise industrialenterprises? Handicraft industry: changes since the introduction of the tax in kind? Extent of development? Source of information? 3. 
 ENCOURAGEMENT OF ENTERPRISE IN COMMODITY EXCHANGE, AND IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN GENERAL This question is closely bound up with the preceding one. 
 The encouragement of initiative may often prove to have no connection with capitalist relationships. 
 All economiccouncils and economic bodies in general should ask them-selves: how is this to be encouraged? In view of the novelty of the task, it is scarcely possible to issue any definite instructions at present. 
 The thing is to pay great attention to the question, encourage all initiative in economic matters,make a careful study of practical experience and let thecountry know what is being done. 
 When the small farmer pays his tax to the state and enters into commodity exchange with it (with the social-ist factory) the economic situation created imperatively demands that the state, through its local bodies, shouldgive all possible encouragement to enterprise and initia-tive. 
 The exchange of the observations and experience oflocal bodies will enable us to collect material, and lateron, perhaps, to supplement this general and inadequate formulation of the question with a number of examples and detailed instructions. 
 4. 
 CO-ORDINATION OF THE ECONOMIC WORK OF VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS IN THE LOCAL ADMINISTRATIVE AREAS: VOLOSTS, UYEZDS AND GUBERNIAS One of the great evils hindering our economic develop-ment is the absence of co-ordination in the work of thevarious local departments. 
 Great attention must be devotedto this question. 
 It is the function of the economic councilsto eliminate this flaw and to stimulate the enterprise of local bodies. 
 There must be a collection of practical exam-ples to secure improvements and hold out the successfulcases as a model for all. 
 During the extreme food shortage,for instance, it was natural and inevitable that local bodiesshould be highly restricted in making decisions on the use ofgrain collected. 
 As grain stocks increase, and under appropri-ate control, they must have a freer hand to do so. 
 This can and should help to reduce red tape, cut down haulage of goods,encourage production and improve the condition of the work-ers and peasants. 
 The food supply, small local industry, fuel,large-scale state industry, etc. 
, are all bound up together,and their necessary division into “departments” for the purposes of state administration will cause harm unless constant efforts are made to co-ordinate them, removefriction, red tape, departmental narrow-mindedness and bureaucratic methods. 
 The local bodies, which are closer to the mass of workers and peasants, have a better view of these defects, and it is therefore their business to devise methods of eliminating them by pooling theirexperience. 
 It is absolutely essential that definite, careful and de-tailed replies should be submitted to the following question:What has been done and how to co-ordinate the activity of the local state farms, timber committees, uyezd land departments, economic councils, and so forth? How are officials penalised for satisfying local require-ments to the detriment of the centre and in violation oforders from the centre? The names of those penalised? Isthe number of such offences diminishing? Have the penalties been increased? If so, in what way? 5. 
 IMPROVEMENT OF THE CONDITION OF THE WORKERS AND 6. 
 DITTO OF THE PEASANTS Every success achieved in economic development im-proves the condition of the workers and peasants. 
 But, first, here again departmental narrow-mindedness andthe lack of co-ordination are doing a great deal of harm. 
And, second, these questions must be brought up well tothe fore to allow a careful observation of the resultsachieved in this sphere. 
 What exactly has been achieved? In what way? Answers to these questions are essential. 
 Weariness and in some cases downright exhaustion as a result of the long years of war, first the imperialist warand then the Civil War, are so great that it is absolutelyessential to make special efforts to improve the conditionof the workers and peasants. 
 Very far from everything is being done that could and should be done, even with our meagre resources. 
 By no means all the departments andagencies are concentrating on it. 
 It is therefore a matterof urgent necessity to collect and study local experiencein this field. 
 The reports should be compiled as precisely,fully and carefully as possible. 
 If that is done, it will at once become evident which departments lag most and where. 
 We shall then secure an improvement more quicklythrough a common effort. 
 7. 
 INCREASING THE NUMBER OF GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT It is extremely important for us to enlarge this group of workers, but very little systematic effort is being madeto do so. 
 Under capitalism, the individual proprietors strove to obtain—secretly from one another, and tripping each other up—the services of good salesmen, managersand directors. 
 It took them decades to do this, and onlya few of the best firms achieved good results. 
 Today, theworkers’ and peasants’ state is the “proprietor”, and itmust select the best men for economic development; it must select the best administrators and organisers on the special and general, local and national scale, doing this publicly,in a methodical and systematic manner and on a broadscale. 
 Now and again we still see traces of the initial periodof the Soviet power—the period of fierce civil war andintense sabotage, traces of Communists isolating themselves in a narrow circle of rulers, being fearful or incapable of enlisting the services of sufficient numbers of non-Partypeople. 
 We must set to work quickly and energetically to correct this. 
 A number of capable and honest non-Party peopleare coming to the fore from the ranks of the workers, peasants and intellectuals, and they should be promoted to more important positions in economic work, with the Com-munists continuing to exercise the necessary control andguidance. 
 Conversely, we must have non-Party peoplecontrolling the Communists. 
 For this purpose, groups ofnon-Party workers and peasants, whose honesty has been tested, should be invited to take part, on the one hand, in the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection, and on the other,in the informal verification and appraisal of work, quiteapart from any official appointment. 
 In their reports to the C. 
L. 
D. 
, the local bodies, particu-larly in the volosts, uyezds and districts, which have the best knowledge of the worker and peasant masses, should give lists of non-Party people who have proved their honestyat work, or who have simply become prominent at non-Party conferences, or who command universal respect in theirfactory, village, volost, etc. 
, and should indicate theirassignments in economic construction. 
 By work is meant official position as well as unofficial participation in control and verification , regular attendance at informal conferences, etc. 
 There must be regular replies to these questions, for otherwise the socialist state will be unable to organise correctly the enlistment of the masses in the work of eco-nomic development. 
 There are any number of honest andloyal workers. 
 There are many of them among the non-Partypeople, but we do not know them. 
 Only local reports canhelp us to find them and try them out in wider and graduallyexpanding fields of work, and cure the evil of isolation of Communist Party cells from the masses, an evil that is in evidence in many places. 
 8. 
 METHODS AND RESULTS OF COMBATING BUREAUCRATIC PRACTICES AND RED TAPE At first, most answers to this question will probably be very simple: methods—nil; results—nil. 
 The decisionsof the Eighth All-Russia Congress of Soviets have been readand forgotten. 
 But although the situation in this field is deplorable, we shall certainly not imitate those who give way to despair. 
 We know that in Russia bureaucratic routine and red tape are mostly due to the low standard of culture and theconsequences of the extreme ruin and impoverishmentresulting from the war. 
 This evil can be overcome only bystrenuous and persistent effort over a long period of years. 
Therefore, we must not give way to despair, but make a new start every time, pick it up where it was abandoned, and try diverse ways of achieving our goal. 
 The reorganisation of the Workers’ and Peasants’ In-spection; enlistment of the services of non-Party peoplewith and without this inspection; legal proceedings; reduc-tion and careful selection of staffs; verification and co-ordination of the work of the various departments, and so on and so forth—all these measures, everything indicated inthe decisions of the Eighth Congress of Soviets, all themeasures and methods mentioned in the press must besystematically, steadily and repeatedly tried out, com-pared and studied. 
 The gubernia economic councils, and all the other bodies co-ordinating and directing economic development in the localities, must insist on the implementation of measures prescribed by the law and indicated by practical expe-rience. 
 Local experience must be pooled. 
 Answers to thisquestion must be sent in to the C. 
L. 
D. 
, regardless of howhard it may be at first to teach people to give exact, full and timely answers. 
 The C. 
L. 
D. 
 will see to it that this is done. 
 It will undoubtedly produce good results, even ifnot as quickly as is expected by those who tend to reduce the “combating of red tape” to a mere phrase (or to a repetition of whiteguard, Socialist-Revolutionary and also Menshevik, gossip) instead of working hard to takedefinite steps. 
 SECOND GROUP OF QUESTIONS 9. 
 REVIVAL OF AGRICULTURE: A) PEASANT FARMING; B) STATE FARMS; C) COMMUNES; D) ARTELS; E) CO-OPERATIVES; F) OTHER FORMS OF COLLECTIVE FARMING The briefest summaries, giving the figures of the reports sent to the respective departments, with the date on whicheach report was sent. 
 More detailed information—not in every report, but periodically, every four or six months, and so forth—on the more important aspects of local farming, results of surveys, the major measures adopted, and their verified results. 
 Exact information must be given at least twice a year on the number of collective farms (all types, b-f), classi-fied according to the degree of organisation—good, fair andunsatisfactory. 
 A typical farm in each of the three groups must be described in detail at least twice a year, with exact data on size, location, production performance, itsassistance to peasant farming, etc. 
 10. 
 REVIVAL OF INDUSTRY: A) LARGE -SCALE INDUSTRY ENTIRELY CONTROLLED BY THE CENTRE; B) LARGE -SCALE INDUSTRY CONTROLLED WHOLLY OR PARTLY BY LOCAL BODIES; C) SMALL, HANDICRAFT, DOMESTIC, ETC. 
, INDUSTRIES The answers should be on the same lines as those for the preceding section. 
 As regards category A, the local bodies, which have opportunities for making a close observation of the work of large national establishments, their influence on the neighbouring population, and the attitude of the population to them, must, in every report, give information on these establishments, the assistance given to them by localbodies, the results of this assistance, the assistance renderedto the local population by these establishments, theirmost urgent requirements, defects in their organisation, etc. 
 11. 
 FUEL: A) FIREWOOD; B) COAL; C) OIL; D) SHALE; E) OTHER TYPES OF FUEL (WASTE FUEL, ETC. 
) The same as for the two preceding questions: the brief-est summaries, giving the figures of the reports sent to the respective departments and dates on which they were sent. 
 Detailed information on major points, on what is outside the scope of the department, on local co-ordination of work, etc. 
 Special attention must be paid to economising fuel. 
 What measures are being taken? What are the results? 12. 
 FOOD SUPPLIES Summary of reports to the Commissariat for Food, follow-ing the same rules as above. 
 Market gardening and suburban farming (connected with industrial establishments). 
 Results. 
 Local experience in organising school meals, the feeding of children, dining-rooms, public catering in general, etc. 
 Bi-monthly summaries in two figures are obligatory, that is, total number of persons receiving food, and totalquantity of foodstuffs distributed. 
 In every large consuming centre (large or medium towns, military institutions in special settlements, etc. 
) we are feeding many extra people, former government officials who have crept into Soviet agencies, bourgeois lying low,profiteers, etc. 
 There must be a determined drive to sift out these superfluous mouths who are breaking the fun-damental law: He who does not work shall not eat. 
 Forthis purpose, a responsible statistician must be appointed in all such places to study the returns of the census of August 28, 1920, and current statistical returns, and submit a signedreport on the number of extra consumers every two months. 
 13. 
 BUILDING INDUSTRY Answers must be on the same lines as the preceding. 
 Local initiative and self-reliance are particularly importantin this sphere and must be given particularly wide scope. 
Detailed information on the major measures and resultsis obligatory. 
 14. 
 MODEL AND HOPELESS ENTERPRISES AND ESTABLISHMENTS A description of every enterprise, establishment and office connected with economic development and meritingthe designation of model, or at least outstanding, or suc-cessful (in the event of there being none in the first two categories) is obligatory. 
 Names of the members of the management boards of these establishments. 
 Their methods. 
Results. 
 Attitude of the workers and the population. 
 The same as regards hopeless and useless enterprises. 
Of special importance is the question of closing down enterprises that are not absolutely essential (hopeless ones, such as might be closed down and their operations transferred to a smaller number of larger enterprises, etc. 
). 
Statistical summary of such superfluous establishments,their number and the order in which the Republic shouldgradually dispense with them. 
 15. 
 IMPROVEMENT IN ECONOMIC WORK Enumerate major and model cases of improvements introduced by inventors and workers of exceptional ability. 
Give names; enumerate experiments which the local bodiesregard as important, and so forth. 
 16. 
 BONUSES IN KIND This is one of the most important factors in socialist development. 
 The enlistment of labour is one of the mostimportant and difficult problems of socialism. 
 Practical experience in this field must be systematically collected, recorded and studied. 
 Obligatory bi-monthly reports showing how many bonuses issued, what the bonuses consist of, what branch of industry (separately forestry and all other branches of work). 
 A comparison of the results, output, with the number of bonuses in kind issued? Have there been any cases of bonuses being converted into a wage reserve? Report each case separately. 
 Have bonuses been issued to conspicuously successful enterprises and individual workers? Give exact detailsof each case. 
 Investigate: can a local product be obtained (for export, or one particularly valuable for use in Russia) by increas-ing the bonuses in kind by a given quantity? This is highlyimportant, because if this survey is properly conductedacross the country we shall discover many valuable productswhich we could profitably export, even if we have to import a certain quantity of goods for the bonuses in kind. 
 17. 
 THE TRADE UNIONS. 
 THEIR PART IN PRODUCTION The gubernia trade union councils and the uyezd trade union bodies must immediately appoint reporters and their deputies who must, on their own, and with the helpof local statisticians, draw up bi-monthly reports on thesubject. 
 As regards production propaganda, give exact facts and figures on lectures, meetings and demonstrations, with the names of organisers, etc. 
 But of even greater importance than production propa-ganda are the facts about the part the factory committeesand the trade unions in general actually play in produc-tion. 
 Forms of participation? Describe every typical case. 
Practical results. 
 Compare establishments where the participation of the trade union in production is well, or fairly well, organised, with those where it is not. 
 The question of labour discipline is particularly im-portant. 
 Reports on the number of absentees are obligatory. 
Compare factories where labour discipline is bad with thosewhere it is good. 
 Methods of improving labour discipline. 
 Comrades’ disciplinary courts. 
 How many, and when established? How many cases examined per month? Results? 18. 
 STEALING While some organisations are aware of this widespread evil and are fighting it, there are others which report that“in the department, office or factory in our charge, there isno stealing”, “everything is in order”. 
 Precise bi-monthly reports are obligatory. 
 How many offices, establishments, and so forth, send in information? How many do not? Brief summary of this information. 
The measures taken to combat stealing. 
Are managers, management boards, or factory committees called to account (for laxity in combating stealing)? Are people searched? Are other methods of control employed; if so, what are they? Is the new law on commodity exchange, and on the permission given the workers to retain part of their outputfor this purpose, having the effect of reducing stealing?Give precise details. 
 Local warehouses, that is, warehouses located in the given district, and belonging to the state or to the localauthorities. 
 Brief summary of the reports on these ware-houses, giving the date on which each was sent. 
 Reports by the local authorities on state warehouses. 
 Methods of protection. 
 Stealing. 
 Number of persons employed, etc. 
 19. 
 PROFITEERING Extent of this according to local information. 
 Predomi-nating type of profiteer. 
 Workers? Peasants? Railwayemployees? Other Soviet employees? And so forth. 
 State of the railways and waterways. 
 Measures to combat profiteering and results obtained. 
What records are being kept of profiteers and profiteering? 20. 
 USE OF ARMY UNITS FOR LABOUR Labour armies. 
 Composition, numerical strength, and performance. 
 Methods of accounting? Attitude of the local population? Other forms of using army units—ditto universal mili-tary training units—for labour purposes. 
 Numerical strength of local army units—ditto local universal military training administration, and number of youths undergoing training in the units. 
 Concrete cases of employment of youths undergoing universal military training and Red Army men for definiteforms of control work, sanitary inspection, help to the localpopulation, various economic operations. 
 Give a detaileddescription of each case, or if there are a number of cases give two typical ones: the most and the least successful. 
 21. 
 LABOUR SERVICE AND LABOUR MOBILISATION How are the local departments of the People’s Com-missariat for Labour organised? What are they doing? Brief summaries of their reports sent to the People’s Commissariat for Labour; give date on which each reportwas sent. 
 Describe, not less than once in four months, two typical cases of labour mobilisation; the most and the leastsuccessful. 
 Enumerate purposes for which labour service was enforced. 
 Total figures of the number engaged and results of workdone. 
 What part do the local departments of the Central Statis-tical Board play in organising labour service and labourmobilisation? THIRD GROUP OF QUESTIONS 22. 
 REGIONAL AND LOCAL ECONOMIC COUNCILS When and how were the economic councils established in the localities at region, gubernia, uyezd and volost level? How is their work co-ordinated between themselves and with the village committees, the factory committees? Economic councils of district Soviets in big towns. 
 Their composition, work, how is the work organised, relationswith the city Soviets? Are there any district committees and district economic councils? Are they necessary? Is it necessary to set up the larger factory or industrial settlements, with their environs,as separate areas, and so forth? 23. 
 GOSPLAN (THE STATE GENERAL PLANNING COMMISSION OF THE C. 
L. 
D. 
) AND ITS RELATIONSHIPS WITH LOCAL ECONOMIC BODIES Are there any regional bodies of Gosplan? Or special representatives of the latter? Or groups of experts actingin such a capacity? Is the work of the local bodies co-ordinated with Gos-plan’s? If so, how? Is such co-ordination necessary? 24. 
 ELECTRIFICATION Have the gubernia and uyezd libraries copies of the Plan for the Electrification of the R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
, which was sub-mitted as a report to the Eighth Congress of Soviets? If so,how many copies? If not, it shows that the local delegatesto the Eighth Congress of Soviets are dishonest and oughtto be expelled from the Party and dismissed from theirresponsible posts, or else they are idlers who should be taught to do their duty by a term of imprisonment (at the Eighth Congress of Soviets, 1,500-2,000 copies werehanded out for local libraries). 
 What measures have been taken to carry out the decision of the Eighth Congress of Soviets to conduct extensivepropaganda of the electrification plan? How many articles on the subject have appeared in the local newspapers? How many lectures have been delivered? Number of personsattending these? Have all local workers with theoretical or practical knowl-edge of electricity been mobilised for the purpose of deliv-ering lectures on, or teaching, the subject? Number of such persons? How is their work being conducted? Are the local or nearest electric power stations utilised for lectures andpurposes of instruction? Number of such stations? How many educational establishments have included the electrification plan in their syllabus, in conformity withthe decision of the Eighth Congress of Soviets? Has anything practical been done towards carrying out this plan? Or any electrification work outside the plan? Ifso, what has been done? Is there a local plan and schedule of work on electrifica-tion? 25. 
 COMMODITY EXCHANGE WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIES It is absolutely obligatory for all border areas to answer this question, but not only for them. 
 Uyezds and guberniasadjacent to border areas also have opportunities for engag-ing in such commodity exchange and observing how it isorganised. 
 Furthermore, as indicated above (Point 16: Bo-nuses in Kind), localities even very remote from the border have opportunities to engage in commodity exchange with foreign countries. 
 State of the ports? Protection of the border? Volume and forms of trade? Brief summaries of the reports on thissent to the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade, givingthe date on which each report was sent. 
 Supervision of the work of the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade by the local economic councils? Theiropinions on practical organisation and results? 26. 
 RAILWAY, WATER AND LOCAL TRANSPORT Brief summaries of the reports sent to the appropriate department, giving date on which each report was sent. 
 State of affairs appraised from the local standpoint. 
Defects in the transport system.

 PRESS PUBLICITY FOR ECONOMIC WORK Local publications and Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn . 
 How is economic work treated in the press? Participation of non-Party people? Verification and appraisal of practical experience? Circulation of local publications and of Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn ? Are they available at the libraries and accessible to the public? Publication of pamphlets and books on economic devel-opment. 
 Give list of the publications issued. 
 Demand for foreign literature: to what extent is it sat-isfied. 
? Are the publications of the Bureau of Foreign Science and Technology delivered? If so, what opinion is expressed about them? Other foreign publications in Russian and other languages? FOURTH GROUP OF QUESTIONS This group should include questions chosen at the discretion of and suggested by the local bodies themselves, and by individuals; moreover, these questions may have a direct or indirect, close or remote, connection with economicdevelopment. 
 These reports must be drawn up in co-operation with the members of the local staffs of the Central StatisticalBoard. 
 Whether this is done by them, or any other persons,is up to the local economic council to decide, but the co-operation of the gubernia statistical bureau and uyezd statisticians is obligatory. 
 Every report and every answer to a question, if written by different persons, must be signedby the author, giving his official position, if he holds one. 
Responsibility for the reports rests on the authors, andthe local economic councils as a whole, and it shall be theirduty to send in regular, punctual and truthful reports. 
 Wherever there is a shortage of local workers, courses of instruction in the compilation of reports must be organ-ised under the supervision of statisticians and comrades,specially appointed for the purpose (from the Workers’ andPeasants’ Inspection, and other bodies). 
 The names of thepersons responsible for these courses and the schedule of instruction must be published.

C. 
P. 
 open. 
 You are aware, comrades, that this conference has been convened earlier than is prescribed by the Rules. 
 Conse-quently, it is not an ordinary, or at least, not quite anordinary conference. 
 You are also aware that the mainitem on the agenda—the main question—that has compelledus to convene the conference before the planned date is that of economic policy—the tax in kind. 
 It is central at the present time. 
 I propose that we proceed to elect the presidium of the conference. 
 2 REPORT ON THE TAX IN KIND MAY 26 Comrades, I had occasion to discuss, for the benefit of the Party, the question of the tax in kind in a pamphletwith which, I suppose, the majority of you are familiar. 
That this question has been brought up for discussion at a Party conference came as a surprise to me, for I had not seen anything to indicate that this was called for. 
 But verymany of the comrades who have visited the localities,notably Comrade Osinsky upon his return from a tour of anumber of gubernias, informed the Central Committee—and this was corroborated by several other comrades—that locally the policy which had taken shape in connection with the tax in kind remained largely unexplained and partlyeven misunderstood. 
 In view of its exceptional importance,additional discussion at a Party conference seemed sonecessary that it was decided to convene the conferenceearlier than scheduled. 
 You are aware that we in the Central Committee have decided to divide the report on this point into four parts, to be given by four rapporteurs: Kamenev,on the work of the co-operatives; Milyutin, on small-scaleindustry; Comrade Svidersky, on the precise calculationsand proposals of the People’s Commissariat for Food, andthe related organisational measures; the instructions and regulations on the tax system, partly approved, and partly to be approved shortly, by the Council of People’s Com-missars, are of especial importance in this connection. 
Finally, Comrade Khinchuk is to be the fourth rapporteur;he has been relieved of all his duties in the People’sCommissariat for Food to allow him to concentrate entirely on the co-operatives, as Chairman of Tsentrosoyuz. 
 * *Central Council of Co-operative Societies. 
— Tr. 
 It has been decided, as the chief principle, that the commodity exchange in this case is to be handled by the People’s Commissariat for Food, mostly and even chiefly, through Tsentrosoyuz and the co-operatives. 
 These rela-tions between the People’s Commissariat for Food andTsentrosoyuz should be formalised in an agreement, statingthat all the goods available for exchange shall be handedover by the People’s Commissariat for Food to Tsentrosoyuz. 
 This makes the latter’s role quite clear, and there is no need to go into it in detail. 
 Thus, it has fallen to me tointroduce the question of the general significance of thispolicy, and I should merely like to supplement what Ihave already said in the pamphlet. 
 I have no directinformation as to how this question is being presented in the localities or to the flaws, defects and unclarity that there prevail. 
 I may have to elaborate certain points later on,when it becomes clearer from the questions that are raisedat the conference, or from the subsequent debate, how thelocal officials and the Party are to be oriented. 
 As far as I can see, the misunderstandings and lack of clarity on the political tasks connected with the tax in kind and the New Economic Policy are perhaps due to the exag-geration of this or that aspect of the matter. 
 But until wehave organised this work on practical lines, these exaggera-tions are absolutely inevitable; and until we have carriedout at least one food campaign on the new lines, it will hardly be possible at all to give any precise definition to the real limits for the application of this or that specificfeature of this policy. 
 I shall deal only in general outlinewith some of the contradictions which, as far as I couldjudge from several notes sent up at the meeting, have givenrise to most misunderstanding. 
 The tax in kind and the attendant changes in our policy are often interpreted as a sign of a drastic reversal of policy. 
 It is not surprisingthat this interpretation is taken up and made most of bythe whiteguard, particularly the Socialist-Revolutionaryand Menshevik, press abroad. 
 I do not know whether itis due to the operation of similar influences which have made themselves felt on the territory of the R. 
S.

, or to the acute discontent which was, and perhaps stillis, evident in certain circles, owing to the extreme aggrava-tion of the food situation, but this sort of perplexity may have spread to some extent even in this country and created what is largely a wrong conception of the significance of the change that has been brought about and of the characterof the new policy. 
 Naturally, in view of the fact that the peasantry pre-ponderates enormously among the population, the principaltask—of our policy in general, and of our economic policy in particular—is to establish definite relations between the working class and the peasantry. 
 For the first time in modernhistory we have a social system from which the exploitingclass has been eliminated but in which there are twodifferent classes—the working class and the peasantry. 
 Theenormous preponderance of the peasantry could not but have an effect on our economic policy, and our policy in general. 
 The principal problem that still confronts us—and willinevitably confront us for many years to come—is thatof establishing proper relations between these two classes,proper from the standpoint of abolishing classes. 
 The ene-mies of the Soviet power discuss the formula of agreement between the working class and the peasantry with such frequency, and so very often use it against us, because it isso vague. 
 Agreement between the working class and thepeasantry may be taken to mean anything. 
 Unless we assumethat, from the working-class standpoint, an agreementis possible in principle, permissible, and correct only if it supports the dictatorship of the working class and is one of the measures aimed at the abolition of classes, then, ofcourse, it remains a formula on which all the enemies of theSoviet-power, all the enemies of the dictatorship, operate. 
How is this agreement to be realised in the first periodof our revolution, i. 
e. 
, the period which we can now approximately consider as coming to a close? How was the dictatorship of the proletariat maintained and consolidatedamidst the enormous preponderance of the peasant popu-lation? It is the Civil War that was the principal reason, theprincipal motive force, and the principal determinant ofour agreement. 
 Although, in many cases, the Civil War was started with the whiteguards, the Socialist-Revolutionaries, and the Mensheviks jointly participating in the allianceagainst us, it invariably led to all the Socialist-Revolution-ary Constituent Assembly and Menshevik elements finding themselves—either through a coup d’état or otherwise— driven into the background, which left the capitalist and landowner elements to head the whiteguard movement. 
That was the case under Kolchak and Denikin, and all thenumerous smaller regimes and during campaigns against us. 
It was the principal factor that determined the form of thealliance between the proletariat and the peasantry. 
 This circumstance multiplied our incredible difficulties, but upon the other hand, it spared us the necessity of racking ourbrains over how to apply the alliance formula, for it andthe conditions of its realisation were both dictated by thecircumstances of war, leaving us no choice whatsoever. 
 Only the working class could exercise the dictatorship in the form demanded by the Civil War and its conditions. 
 The participation of the landowners in this war united theworking class and the peasantry absolutely, unreservedlyand irrevocably. 
 In that respect there was no internalpolitical wavering whatsoever. 
 Amidst the gigantic dif-ficulties that confronted us because Russia was cut off from her principal grain areas and food hardships had been aggravated to the extreme, we could not havecarried out our food policy in practice without the appro-priation of surplus grain. 
 This meant taking not only thesurplus stocks of grain, which would hardly have sufficedeven if they had been properly distributed. 
 I cannot here deal in detail with the irregularities which the system brought in its train. 
 At all events, it served its main purpose—keepingindustry going even when we were almost completely cutoff from the grain districts. 
 But this could have been at allsatisfactory only in conditions of war. 
 As soon as we hadfinally done away with the external enemy—and this became a fact only in 1921—another task confronted us, the task of establishing an economic alliance between the work-ing class and the peasantry. 
 It was only in the spring of1921 that we actually got down to this task, and that waswhen the 1920 crop failure had worsened the condition ofthe peasantry to an incredible degree, and when we first witnessed some internal political wavering, which did not result from external enemy pressure, but from the rela-tions between the working class and the peasantry. 
 If we had had a very good, or at least a good, harvest in 1920, if the surplus appropriations had yielded 400 million out of the planned 420 million poods of grain, we would have been able to fulfil the greater part of our industrial pro-gramme and would have had a stock of manufactured urbangoods to exchange for agricultural produce. 
 But the oppositehappened. 
 A fuel crisis, even more acute than the foodcrisis, developed in some places and it was utterly impos-sible to satisfy the needs of the peasant farms in urban manufactures. 
 Peasant farming was gripped by an in-credibly acute crisis. 
 Those were the circumstances thatsuggested that we could not possibly continue with the oldfood policy. 
 We had to bring up the question of what eco-nomic basis we required immediately for the alliance between the working class and the peasantry as a stepping stone to further measures. 
 The stepping stone is to prepare the exchange of industrial goods for agricultural produce; to create a system underwhich the peasant would not have to surrender his produceotherwise than in exchange for urban and factory-made goods, but which would not subordinate him to any of the forms existing under the capitalist system. 
 In view ofthe prevailing economic conditions, however, we could noteven think about that. 
 That is why we have adopted thetransitional form I have spoken about, namely, to takeproduce in the form of a tax without giving any equivalent, and to obtain additional produce through the medium of exchange. 
 But this requires an appropriate fund; ours isextremely small, and the possibility of augmenting itthrough foreign trade has arisen only this year, as a result ofa number of agreements with capitalist countries. 
 It is truethat these are as yet a mere introduction, a foreword; no real trade has yet begun. 
 There is continued sabotage and all sorts of attempts to disrupt these agreements by mostor the greater part of the capitalist circles, and the mostcharacteristic thing is that the Russian whiteguard press,including the Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik press,is hammering away at these agreements with more venom than at anything else. 
 It is absolutely clear that the bour-geoisie is better prepared for the fight, that it is moredeveloped than the proletariat, that its class-consciousness has been given a keener edge by all the “trouble” it has had to put up with, and that it is betraying an abnormal sensitiveness. 
 A close look at the whiteguard press will show that it is hitting out at the very point that is the centre,the pivot, of our policy. 
 After the failure of the military invasion, which has quite obviously collapsed, although the struggle is still on,the whole of the whiteguard Russian press has set itself an unattainable aim: to tear up the trade agreements. 
 The campaign which was started this spring on an extremelyextensive scale, with the Socialist-Revolutionaries andMensheviks in the forefront of the counter-revolutionaryforces, had a definite aim—to tear up the economic agree-ments between Russia and the capitalist world by this spring; and to a considerable extent they succeeded in achieving their aim. 
 It is true that we have concluded the principalagreements—their number is increasing—and we are over-coming the growing resistance to them. 
 But there has beena very dangerous delay; for, without some assistance fromabroad, rehabilitation of large-scale industry and restora-tion of regular exchange of commodities will either be impossible or will mean very dangerous delay. 
 These arethe conditions in which we are obliged to act, and these arethe conditions which for the peasants have brought thequestion of restoring trade to the forefront. 
 I shall not dealwith the question of concessions, because it has been de-bated most at Party meetings, and has not lately given rise to any perplexity. 
 The position is that we are continuingour assiduous offers of concessions, but the foreign capitalistshave not yet received a single sizable concession, and we havenot yet concluded any really serious concessions agreement. 
The whole difficulty lies in finding a way of enlisting West-European capital that has been tested in practice. 
 Theoretically, it is absolutely indisputable—and it seems to me that everyone’s doubts on this score have beendispelled—theoretically, I say, it is absolutely clear that itwould be to our advantage to pay off European capitalwith a few score or hundreds of millions, which we could give it in order to augment, in the shortest possible time, our stocks of equipment, materials, raw materials and machin-ery for the purpose of restoring our large-scale industry. 
 Large-scale industry is the one and only real basis upon which we can multiply our resources and build a socialist society. 
 Without large factories, such as capitalism has created, without highly developed large-scale industry,socialism is impossible anywhere; still less is it possible in apeasant country, and we in Russia have a far more concreteknowledge of this than before; so that instead of speakingabout restoring large-scale industry in some indefinite and abstract way, we now speak of the definite, precisely calculated and concrete plan of electrification. 
 We havea precise plan projected by the best Russian specialists andscientists, a plan which gives us a definite picture of theresources, considering Russia’s natural features, with whichwe can, must and will lay the basis of large-scale industry for our economy. 
 Without it, no real socialist foundation for our economic life is possible. 
 This remains absolutelyindisputable, and if, in connection with the tax in kind,we have lately spoken about it in abstract terms, wemust now say definitely that we must first of all restorelarge-scale industry. 
 I myself have heard statements of this kind from several comrades, and all I could do in reply was, of course, to shrug my shoulders. 
 It is absolutelyridiculous and absurd to assume that we could ever lose sightof this fundamental aim. 
 The only question that arises hereis: how could such doubts and perplexity arise in the mindsof comrades, and how could they think that this key task, without which the material production basis of socialism is impossible, has been pushed into the background? Thesecomrades must have misunderstood the relation betweenour state and small industry. 
 Our main task is to restorelarge-scale industry, but in order to approach this task atall seriously and systematically we must restore small industry. 
 Both this year, 1921, and last year, we had great gaps in our efforts to restore large-scale industry. 
 In the autumn and winter of 1920 we started several important branches of our large-scale industry, but we hadto suspend them again. 
 Why? Many factories were able toobtain enough manpower and sufficient supplies of raw materials; why then was work at these factories suspended? Because we were short of food and fuel. 
 Without a statereserve of 400 million poods of grain (I take an approximate figure) backed up by regular monthly allotments, it is difficult to talk about any sort of regular economic devel-opment or of restoring large-scale industry. 
 Without it we find that after having started work on restoring large-scale industry and continuing it for several months we havehad to suspend it again. 
 Most of the few factories that werestarted are now idle. 
 Without fully assured and adequatefood stocks the state cannot concentrate on systematically organising the rehabilitation of large-scale industry, or-ganising it on a modest scale, perhaps, but in such a wayas to keep it going continuously. 
 As regards fuel, until the Donbas is restored, and until we obtain a regular supply of oil, we shall have to continueto rely on timber, on firewood, which again means depend-ence on small-scale production. 
 That explains the mistake of those comrades who failed to understand why it is the peasant who must now be placedin the centre of things. 
 Some workers say: the peasants arebeing favoured, but we get nothing. 
 I have heard such talk,but I must say I think it is not very widespread, for such talk is dangerous, because it echoes the Socialist-Revolu-tionaries. 
 It is an obvious political provocation; and is,besides, a survival of craft—not class—but craft-unionprejudices of workers, when the working class regards itselfa part of equitable capitalist society and fails to realisethat it still stands on the old capitalist basis. 
 These work-ers say, in fact: the peasant is being favoured, he has been relieved of surplus-grain appropriation, he is allowed toretain his grain surplus for the purpose of exchange; weworkers at the bench want to have the same thing. 
 What is at the bottom of this point of view? It is, in essence, the old petty-bourgeois ideology: since the peasants are a component part of capitalist society, the working class also remains a component part of this society; hence,if the peasant trades, we too must trade. 
 Here we undoubt-edly see a revival of the old prejudices which grapple theworker to the old world. 
 The Socialist-Revolutionaries andMensheviks are the most ardent and, in fact, the only sin-cere, champions of the old capitalist world. 
 You will find none among the hundreds, the thousands, and even thehundreds of thousands in all the other camps. 
 But these rare specimens remain among the so-called pure democrats, whom the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks represent. 
 And the more persistently they advocate their views, the more dangerous is their influence over the working class. 
 Theyare doubly dangerous when the working class has to gothrough periods of suspended production. 
 The principalmaterial basis for the development of proletarian class-consciousness is large-scale industry, where the worker sees the factories running, and daily feels the power that can really abolish classes. 
 When the workers lose their footing in this material production basis, some of them are beset by a sense ofinstability, uncertainty, despair and skepticism, and thishas a definite effect when combined with outright provoca-tions by our bourgeois democrats, i. 
e. 
, the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks. 
 This produces a mentalitywhich makes people, even in the ranks of the CommunistParty, reason in this way: the peasants were given a hand-out; for the same reasons, and by the same methods, ahandout should be given to the workers. 
 We have had to yield to this mentality to some extent. 
 The decree on bonuses to workers in the form of a part of the goods theyproduce is, of course, a concession to these sentiments, whichhave their roots in the past and are engendered by skep-ticism and despair. 
 Within certain small limits, this con-cession was necessary. 
 It has been made. 
 But we must not for a moment forget that we have been making a concession that is necessary from no other standpoint but the economicone: the interests of the proletariat. 
 Its basic and mostvital interests are bound up with the rehabilitation oflarge-scale industry as a solid economic foundation. 
 Whenthat is done, it will consolidate its dictatorship, it will be sure to carry its dictatorship to success, in the teeth of all the political and military difficulties. 
 Why, then, werewe obliged to make a concession, and why would it beextremely dangerous to give it a wider interpretation thanit deserves? It is only because temporary food and fuel dif-ficulties compelled us to take this path. 
 What is the principal economic determinant of the policy when we say, “We must not base our relations with thepeasants on surplus-grain appropriation but on a tax”? It is that under the surplus-grain appropriation system the small peasant farms have no proper economic basis and are doomed to remain dead for many years. 
 Small farming can-not exist and develop, because the petty farmer loses interestin consolidating and developing his activity and in increas-ing his output, all of which leaves us without an economicbasis. 
 We have no other basis or source, and unless the stateis able to accumulate large stocks of food it is no use thinking about the rehabilitation of large-scale industry. 
 That is why we are first of all applying this policy which ischanging our food relations. 
 We are conducting this policy so as to have a fund for the rehabilitation of large-scale industry; to relieve theworking class from all interruption of work, which should not be experienced even by our large-scale industry, miser-able though it is when compared with that of the advancedcountries; to relieve the proletarian of the need to find themeans of subsistence by resorting to the petty-bourgeoismethod of profiteering, which is not a proletarian methodand threatens us with the gravest economic dangers. 
 Owing to our present deplorable conditions, proletarians are obliged to earn a living by methods which are not proletarianand are not connected with large-scale industry. 
 They areobliged to procure goods by petty-bourgeois profiteeringmethods, either by stealing, or by making them for them-selves in a publicly-owned factory, in order to barter them for agricultural produce—and that is the main economic danger, jeopardising the existence of the Soviet system. 
 Theproletariat must now exercise its dictatorship in such a wayas to have a sense of security as a class, with a firm footing. 
But the ground is slipping from under its feet. 
 Insteadof large, continuously running factories, the proletarian sees something quite different, and is compelled to enter the economic sphere as a profiteer, or as a small producer. 
 We must spare no sacrifice in this transitional period to save the proletariat from this. 
 To ensure the contin-uous, if slow, rehabilitation of large-scale industry wemust not hesitate to throw sops to the greedy foreign capitalists, because, from the standpoint of building socialism, it is at present to our advantage to overpay theforeign capitalists some hundreds of millions in order to obtain the machines and materials for the rehabilitation of large-scale industry, which will restore the economic basis of the proletariat, and will transform it into a stead-fast proletariat, instead of one engaged in profiteering. 
The Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries have deaf-ened us with their shouts that since the proletariat has beendeclassed, we ought to abandon the tasks of the dictatorshipof the proletariat. 
 They have been shouting that since 1917, and the surprising thing is that they have not grown tired of shouting it up to 1921. 
 But when we hear these attackswe do not say that there has been no declassing, and thatthere are no flaws. 
 What we say is that Russian and inter-national realities are such that even though the proletar-iat has to go through a period when it is declassed, and has to suffer from these handicaps, it can nevertheless fulfil its task of winning and holding political power. 
 It would be absurd and ridiculous to deny that the fact that the proletariat is declassed is a handicap. 
 By 1921,we realised that after the struggle against the externalenemy, the main danger and the greatest evil confronting us was our inability to ensure the continuous operation of the few remaining large enterprises. 
 This is the main thing. 
Without such an economic basis, the working class cannotfirmly hold political power. 
 In order to ensure thecontinued rehabilitation of large-scale industry we mustorganise the food supply in such a way as to collect and properly distribute a fund of, say, 400 million poods. 
 It would be utterly impossible for us to collect it through theold surplus-grain appropriation system: 1920 and 1921 areproof of this. 
 Now we see that we can nonetheless fulfil thisextremely difficult task by means of the tax in kind. 
 Wecannot fulfil it with the old methods, and so we must try some new ones. 
 It can be done by means of the tax in kind and by establishing proper relations with the peasant asa small producer. 
 We have devoted considerable effort toprove this theoretically. 
 I think, judging by the Party press and by what is being said at meetings, that it has been fully proved theoretically that this task can be fulfilled if the proletariat retains possession of the transport system, the big factories, theeconomic basis as well as political power. 
 We must give the peasant a fair amount of leeway as a small producer. 
 Unless we revive peasant farming we shall not solve the food problem. 
 It is within this framework that we must deal with the question of developing small industry on the basis ofunrestricted trade and free turnover. 
 This free turnover isa means to establish economically stable relations betweenthe working class and the peasantry. 
 We now have more and more precise data on agricultural output. 
 A pamphlet on grain output was distributed at the Party Congress; it wasstill in proofs when it was distributed to the delegates. 
Since then the material contained in it has been supplement-ed and circulated. 
 The pamphlet in its final form has nowbeen sent to the press, but it is not yet ready for the conference, and I am unable to say whether it will be ready before the conference comes to a close and the delegatesdisperse. 
 We shall do all we can to get it out in time, butwe cannot promise to do so. 
 This is a small part of our effort to determine, as precisely as possible, the position in regard to agricultural output, and the resources at our disposal. 
 Still, we can say that there is evidence that we are quite able to solve this economic problem, particularly this year,when the harvest prospects are not too bad, or not as bad aswe anticipated in spring. 
 This assures us of thepossibility of accumulating an agricultural reserve that will enable us to devote ourselves entirely to the task of steadily, even if slowly, restoring our large-scale industry. 
 In order to solve the problem of accumulating food stocks for industry we must devise a form of relations with the peas-ant, the small proprietor, and there is no other form exceptthat of the tax in kind; no one has come up with another form, and one can be imagined. 
 But we must have a practical solution of this problem: we must arrange to have the taxcollected in a proper manner, and not in the old way, whengrain was taken two or three times, leaving the peasant ina worse plight than ever, inflicting the most suffering onthe more industrious and destroying every possibility of establishing economically stable relations. 
 The tax in kind, while also a levy on every peasant, must be collected in adifferent way. 
 On the basis of the collected and published data we can say that the tax in kind will now bring about a crucial change, but whether it will cover everything is still, to some extent, an open question. 
 Of one thing we can be quite certain, however, and it is that we must bringabout an immediate improvement in the condition of thepeasant. 
 The task that confronts the local workers is to collect the tax in kind in full, and do so in the shortest possible time. 
 The difficulties are increased by the fact that the harvest promises to be an unusually early one this year, andif our preparations are based on the customary dates, we runthe risk of being too late. 
 That is why the early convoca-tion of the Party conference was important and opportune. 
We must work more quickly than before to prepare the apparatus for collecting the tax in kind. 
 The accumulation of a minimum state fund of 240 million poods of grain andthe possibility of making the position of the peasant securedepend on the speed with which the tax in kind is collected. 
Delay in collecting it will cause a certain amount of inconveni-ence to the peasant. 
 The tax will not be paid voluntarily, we shall not be able to dispense with coercion, for the levy imposes some restrictions on the peasant farm. 
 If we dragout the process of collecting the tax, the peasant will bediscontent and will say that he is not free to dispose of hissurplus. 
 If the freedom is to be such in practice, the taxmust be collected quickly; the tax-collector must not hover over the peasant for long, and so the period between the harvesting and the collection of the tax in full must bereduced to a minimum. 
 That is one task. 
 The other is to maximise the peasant’s freedom of trade and the revival of small-scale industry,so as to allow some leeway to the capitalism that grows up on the basis of small private property and petty trade. 
 We should not be afraid of it, for it is not dangerous tous in the least. 
 We need not fear it at all in view of the general economic and political situation that has now arisen, with the pro-letariat controlling all the sources of large-scale production, and denationalisation in any shape or form entirely out of the question. 
 At a time when we are suffering most of allfrom a severe shortage of goods and utter impoverish-ment, it is ridiculous to fear the threat of capitalism based on small commercial agriculture. 
 To fear it is to fail altogether to take account of the relation of forces in our economy. 
 It means to fail to understand that the peasanteconomy, as a small-scale peasant economy, cannot bestable at all without some free exchange and the attendantcapitalist relations. 
 This is what you must firmly impress on your minds, comrades. 
 And our main task is to give a push to the com-rades in all the localities, to give them the utmost scopefor initiative, to stimulate them to display the utmostself-reliance and boldness. 
 In this respect we are still suffer-ing from the fear of doing things on a really wide scale. 
 Wehave no more or less definitely tabulated local data showing from practical experience what the situation is in regard to local goods exchange and trade, what success has been achievedin restoring and developing small industry—which canalleviate the condition of the peasant right away, without thegreat effort of transporting large stocks of food and fuel tothe industrial centres that large-scale industry entails. 
 From the general economic standpoint, not enough is being done locally in this respect. 
 We have no information on thisfrom the localities, we do not know what the position isall over the Republic, we have no examples of reallywell-organised work; and my impression is that the TradeUnion Congress and the Congress of the Supreme Economic Council 116 have none either. 
 Here again, the principal defect of these congresses is that we devote ourselves mainly to such threadbare thingsas theses, general programmes and arguments, instead ofgiving the participants a chance to swap local experienceand say, on returning home: “Out of a thousand examples we heard one good one, and we shall follow it. 
” Actually, we have not only one good example in a thousand, we havemany more; but least of all do we see congress work arrangedin this way. 
 I have no wish to forestall events, but I must say a word or two about collective supplies for the workers, i. 
e. 
, about the proposal to substitute for the ration system a system under which certain factories that are actually in operationwill be assured of a certain quantity of food in proportion to their output. 
 The idea is an excellent one, but we have turned it into something semi-fantastic, without however doing any real preparatory work for it. 
 We have no example as yet of any particular factory, even one employing asmall number of workers, in a particular uyezd, havingtried out this system and having secured such-and-suchresults. 
 That is something we do not as yet have, and it is oneof the greatest drawbacks in our work. 
 We must keep repeat-ing that instead of discussing general problems, which was all very well in 1918, i. 
e. 
, in the long distant past, wemust, in this 1921, discuss practical problems. 
 By tellingcongresses first of all about the examples of well-organisedwork—there are quite enough of them—we would make itan obligation for the rest to strive to imitate the best that has been achieved in a few rare and exceptional localities. 
 I have in mind the work of the Trade Union Congress, butit also applies to all work connected with the food problem. 
 Quite a lot has been done in some cases, in a few localities, to prepare for the collection of the tax in kind, the organi-sation of trade, etc. 
, but we have not managed to study this experience; and the great task that confronts us now is to induce the vast majority of the localities to followthe example of the best. 
 Our task now is to study practicalexperience and raise the backward and medium uyezds andvolosts, the standard of which is absolutely unsatisfactory,to the level of the insignificant number of highly satisfac-tory ones. 
 At our congresses we must shift our main atten-tion from the study of general theses and programmes ofmeetings to the study of practical experience, to the studyof the examples set by the satisfactory and highly satis-factory districts, and to raising the backward and mediumones, which predominate, to the level of these good ones, which may be few but are still there. 
 Those are the remarks to which I must confine myself. 
 (Applaus e. 
) 3 SUMMING -UP SPEECH ON THE TAX IN KIND MAY 27 Comrades, although many comrades from the provinces have expressed dissatisfaction with the reports and the debate, it seems to me that we have, at any rate, achieved one object—we have ascertained how the new policy isunderstood and applied locally. 
 The conference could hardlyhave set itself any other aim than that of securing an ex-change of opinion for the purpose of thoroughly assimilatingthis new policy and of unanimously proceeding to its proper application. 
 This we have achieved. 
 True, there has been some perplexity and even wavering, which, unfortu-nately, in some cases, went far beyond perplexity overpractical questions and conjectures about whether the newpolicy was meant “seriously” or “not seriously”, and for howlong. 
 What Comrade Vareikis said, for example, was really not communist at all, and in content smacked of Menshe-vism. 
 I must say this quite bluntly. 
 How could he keepasking: “Tell us, is the peasantry a class, or not a class?”Of course, it is a class. 
 In that case, he says, it must havepolitical concessions, or, if not that, then certain measuresshould be taken in that direction, which will resemble Zubatovism 117 just the same. 
 Reference was made here to the fact that Martov had put the case squarely, whereas Vareikis was adding: “Toa certain extent”, “to some degree”, “partly”. 
 This causedincredible, monstrous confusion. 
 It is the same sort ofconfusion that was displayed when we were being accused of employing force. 
 Again we have to explain that when we speak of dictatorship we mean the employment of coercion. 
Every state implies employment of coercion; but the whole difference lies in whether it is employed against the exploited or against the exploiters. 
 Is it employed against the toiling and exploited class? The same applies to the reference to Zubatovism. 
 What was Zubatovism? It wassupport for the oppressor class by means of small economicconcessions to the oppressed classes. 
 That is why theresponse at that time was: economic concessions will not helpyou to induce the proletariat, the class that is fighting for the emancipation of all the oppressed, to abandon the idea of capturing political power and of destroying the systemof oppression. 
 At present the proletariat holds power andguides the state. 
 It guides the peasantry. 
 What does thatmean? It means, first, pursuing a course towards the abo-lition of classes, and not towards the small producer. 
 If we strayed from this bedrock course we should cease to be socialists and would find ourselves in the camp of the pettybourgeoisie, the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks,who are now the proletariat’s most bitter enemies. 
 Notlong ago Comrade Bukharin quoted in Pravda some utterances of such a serious political thinker as Milyukov (Chernov and Martov come nowhere near him), who argued that only a socialist party could occupy the arena of politicalstruggle in Russia today. 
 And since the “socialist” parties,the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Mensheviks, desireto take the trouble of fighting the Bolsheviks, they “arewelcome to try”. 
 That is literally what Milyukov said, and it proves that he is cleverer than Martov and Chernov, simply because he is a representative of the big bour-geoisie (even if he personally had less brains than Chernovand Martov). 
 Milyukov is right. 
 He takes a very soberaccount of the stages of political development and says thatSocialist-Revolutionism and Menshevism are the necessary stepping stones leading to a reversion to capitalism. 
 The bourgeoisie needs such stepping stones, and whoever doesnot understand this is stupid. 
 From the standpoint of the interests of the bourgeoisie, Milyukov is absolutely right. 
 Since we, being the party ofthe proletariat, are leading the peasantry, we must pursue a course towards strengthening large-scale industry, and must therefore be prepared to make economic concessions. 
The proletariat led the peasantry, and did it in such a way that during the Civil War the peasantry obtained more eco-nomic benefits than the proletariat. 
 In Martov’s terms, this is Zubatovism. 
 Economic concessions have been made to the peasantry. 
 These concessions were made to a section of theworking people constituting the majority of the population. 
Is this policy wrong? No, it is the only correct one! Andno matter what you say about Martov’s catchwords, aboutit being impossible to deceive a class, I ask you neverthe-less: where is our deception? We say that there are two paths to choose: one following Martov and Chernov—andthrough them to Milyukov—and the other following theCommunists. 
 As for us, we are fighting for the abolition ofcapitalism and the establishment of communism. 
 Ours isa very hard road, and many are weary and lack faith. 
 The peasants lack faith. 
 But are we deceiving them? It is ridiculous to say that we are deceiving a class, and have lostour way amidst three pines, or even two, for the workingclass and the peasantry are only two classes. 
 The proletariatleads the peasantry, which is a class that cannot be drivenout as the landowners and capitalists were driven out and destroyed. 
 We must remould it by prolonged and persistent effort, entailing great privation. 
 It depends on us, theruling party, how much of the suffering will fall to the lotof the proletariat and how much to that of the peasantry. 
How is this suffering to be shared? Is it to be on a basisof equality? Let Chernov and Martov say that. 
 We say that we must be guided by the interests of the proletariat, that is, we must obtain safeguards against the restoration ofcapitalism and ensure the road to communism. 
 Since thepeasantry is now wearier and more exhausted, or rather itthinks that it is so, we make more concessions to it in orderto obtain safeguards against the restoration of capitalism and to ensure the road to communism. 
 That is the correct policy, and we are guided exclusively by class considera-tions. 
 We tell the peasants frankly and honestly, without anydeception: in order to hold the road to socialism, we aremaking a number of concessions to you, comrade peasants,but only within the stated limits and to the stated extent; and, of course, we ourselves shall be the judge of the limits and the extent. 
 The concession itself is being made withan eye to distributing the burdens which, up to now, the proletariat has borne to a larger extent than the peasantry. 
 During the three and a half years of the dictatorship of the proletariat, it has voluntarily borne more hardships than the peasantry. 
 This is an absolutely obvious and incon-trovertible truth. 
 This is how the question stands in regardto the relations between the proletariat, and the peasantry:either the peasantry comes to an agreement with us and wemake economic concessions to it—or we fight. 
 That is why all other arguments are but evidence of a terrible confusion. 
 As a matter of fact, any other road leads to Milyukov, andthe restoration of the landowners and capitalists. 
 We saythat we shall agree to make any concession within the limitsof what will sustain and strengthen the power of the prole-tariat, which, in spite of all difficulties and obstacles, is unswervingly advancing towards the abolition of classes and towards communism. 
 The next point is that much of the criticism of Comrade Svidersky’s speech was wrong. 
 All the members of theopposition at once hurled themselves upon him with whatmight be called brilliant parliamentary speeches, Comrade Larin proving to be the most brilliant representative of the “parliamentary opposition”. 
 The Soviet system does notprovide many opportunities for making parliamentaryspeeches; but nature asserts herself, and although we haveno parliamentary institutions, the parliamentary mannersurvives. 
 Concerning Comrade Svidersky they complained that he had proposed the introduction of a food supply inspec-torate, and had even gone to the length of talking abouta food dictatorship. 
 Comrade Svidersky may have overstatedhis case, but he is right in substance. 
 We distributedthe reporters’ roles in such a way that each played on adifferent instrument, as it were. 
 The report on the question of exchange was made by the representative of Tsentrosoyuz, Comrade Khinchuk—the co-operator. 
 As you are well aware,Tsentrosoyuz has concluded an agreement with the state. 
 Ifsome of the comrades have not read it, this only goes toshow that they have not treated the material of theconference in a business-like way. 
 Our state concludes an agreement with the representative of Tsentrosoyuz: the representative of the People’s Commissariat for Food con-cludes an agreement with the representative of the co-operative societies, and co-operators abroad must reckon with our agreement. 
 Under the agreement all goods are delivered to the co-operative societies, so that the co-operators may trade on our behalf—on behalf of the centralised state, the bigfactories, and the proletariat—but not on their own behalf. 
This is a major and most important condition, because therecan be no other arrangement. 
 Petrograd and Moscow arestarving, while the well-fed gubernias, as Comrade Bryu-khanov’s figures show, have eaten twice as much, and sent us half as much as they should have. 
 What do you say:in the circumstances, do we or do we not need a fooddictatorship? I think we do; we need it very much, indeed,because there is any amount of this laxity all over thecountry. 
 You must realise that we cannot do without coercion, and Tsentrosoyuz must do the distributing under our control. 
 We say to Tsentrosoyuz: you have traded well and we will give you a bonus in the form of a definite percentage. 
 Thisis stipulated in the agreement, and we will encourage thiscommission-basis trading by every sort of bonus system. 
 We will give a bonus for profitable trade; but we will demand that this trade is carried on for our benefit, for the benefitof the state, which has centralised large-scale industry, andwhich is governed by the proletariat. 
 Does large-scaleindustry stand to gain? Who stands to gain? How can you ensure food supplies without a tax? You cannot. 
 We do not know whether the tax or the exchange will yield most, but we do know—and it is a fact—that we lackan adequate fund for exchange. 
 At the present time, youcannot get what you need without an instrument of coercion. 
Never! This is obvious. 
 And in this, Svidersky, as arepresentative of his line, is absolutely right. 
 We have approved of the establishment of a food supply inspectorate, and the Presidium of the All-Russia Central ExecutiveCommittee will bring more pressure to bear on you becauseyou know who ought to be appointed; that is your business;but once you make the appointment, see that the man doeshis job. 
 Things being what they are, unless the state is assured of approximately 400 million poods of grain, it is no use talking about large-scale industry and socialistconstruction. 
 Those who have not learned this in the course of the past three years are not worth arguing with. 
 But in spite of our numerous mistakes, we have increased this fund. 
 True, while increasing the fund in 1920, we blundered over distribution, but enormous progress wasmade nonetheless. 
 We must approach the subject soberlyand say that to collect the tax in kind we need an expe-ditious apparatus, and it is no use making liberal speechesand hinting that a food supply inspectorate is such a nasty thing. 
 I am not aware of the existence of a “communist” system under which you could expect to collect—without coercion—a tax from the peasantry constituting a majority of thepopulation in the period of transition from capitalism tocommunism. 
 If you want to sustain large-scale industry— the basis of the proletarian dictatorship—then you must want this apparatus to function. 
 And this, naturally,demands centralism. 
 Look at the figures. 
 Unfortunately, fewof you are sufficiently familiar with them. 
 See how much thelocalities have kept for themselves, in spite of the ordersfrom the centre. 
 The comrades from Moscow and Petrograd have quoted figures here showing that the orders from the centre are not being fully carried out. 
 It turns out that threereminders were given, and an equal number of censures. 
What else is there to do? There remains nothing but dis-missal, arrest and so forth. 
 ( A voice : “How many such cases were there?”) There were many cases of infringements, but few dismissals. 
 That is what I wanted to say in defence of this line of policy. 
 The harvest this year will evidently be a fair one in many parts, and will set in earlier than we expected. 
 Hence,we must make preparations beforehand, the situation nowbeing such that we must swiftly collect the main fund. 
 Consequently, it is absolutely wrong to take the approach that many did here. 
 As for Comrade Larin, his talents lie more in the sphere of parliamentary opposition and journalism than businessefficiency. 
 He is tireless in the drawing-up of projects. 
He mentioned that he had proposed a good plan as early as January 1920, but if we were to collect all of his projects and pick out the good ones, we would probably find thatthey add up to one in ten thousand. 
 On May 10, he submitted a scheme to the Central Com-mittee’s Political Bureau for a general introduction of a collective supply system. 
 Its main principle is alluring, but when was it proposed? On May 10, 1921, when therewas an absolute shortage of food in centres like Moscow andPetrograd, when these important centres of the RussianRepublic were temporarily doomed to semi-starvation andeven worse. 
 It is ridiculous to propose a reshuffle of the food supply organisations at a time when men are on their last legs, and are overworking the trunk-lines to Siberia,the Caucasus and the Ukraine, in an effort to track downevery trainload, every car almost. 
 What the devil is theuse of introducing a collective supply system at a time likethat? The Political Bureau adopted the following resolu-tion: “That the scheme proposed by Larin and the All-Russia Central Council of Trade Unions [the A. 
C. 
C. 
T. 
U. 
,of course, hastened to put its signature to it] be rejected;that the author of the scheme be instructed to re-examinethe question with greater care, in the light of the actualpossibilities of obtaining supplies.... 
” This principle was reiterated (in Chubar’s and Holtzmann’s theses, if you have read them) at the Trade Union Congress; Chubar had for-mulated the main parts of his theses in harmony with thepolicy of circumspection laid down by the Party’s CentralCommittee. 
 Holtzmann and Larin behaved according tothe rule which Larin, half in jest, whispered in my ear at the end of the meeting of the Political Bureau. 
 (I don’t think I shall be committing an indiscretion if I relate thisconversation. 
) When Larin saw that the resolution hadbeen adopted he said to me: “You have given us your littlefinger, but we will take your hand. 
” Then I said to myself—although I had known it before—now we know how to bargain with Larin. 
 If he asks for a million rubles, offer him fifty kopeks. 
 ( Laughter . 
) During the debate, when Larin was asked for the facts, he quoted the example (which hesaid was “brilliant”) of the construction of the Kizlyar-Staro-Terek railway. 
 Although it has already been shownthat there is nothing new in this example, that similar experiments have been made before, it is a sign of progress to hear definite examples and results of experience, insteadof general arguments and countless theses, It would be disastrous if everyone began reading and discussing these theses, nine-tenths of which you cannot read to the end without a splitting headache. 
 It is not theses, but a record of local experience, that we need. 
 Let us study this experience, instead of pilingsystem upon system and drawing up laws on collectivesupplies when we lack even the minimum of real supplies. 
Practical work is going on in the localities. 
 We were told: it is not right to reproach the localities for not sharing their experiences. 
 The Central Committee was reproached here fornot giving publicity to local experience. 
 But we have noneof it: our time is taken up entirely with decrees. 
 The majorityof us are immersed in this unpleasant work, and that is whywe cannot see local experience. 
 It is your business to bring it to us. 
 Larin was right in quoting the fine example of the Kizlyar-Terek railway, for it was a piece of local experience. 
But even here he allowed his imagination to run away withhim, and Chubar and Osinsky had to put him right. 
 This isnot the only example. 
 He said that a worker received 28pounds under the old system and four poods under the new system. 
 I was doubtful about the figures and so I asked him: Where did you get that from? He replied that theyhad been certified by the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspec-tion. 
 But we know that Larin is not only a parliamentaryman, but also a cartoonist. 
 First, he drew a cartoon satiris-ing the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection. 
 And now he says: four poods instead of 28 pounds—certified by the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection. 
 First, he underminesconfidence in the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection by relat-ing anecdotes of that kind, and then presents the certificateof the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection as sole proof. 
Chubar and Osinsky say that this system has been repeat-edly employed in the timber industry. 
 The whole point is to compare the experience of one locality with that ofanother. 
 The best part of Larin’s statement was his descrip-tion of the work on the Kizlyar-Terek railway. 
 But whatwe need to know is whether things have not been donebetter in Tula or Tambov. 
 The centre cannot tell you that, because we do not know. 
 You should bring us this infor-mation from the localities, show us the facts, teach us, andwe will all learn, and try to follow the best example. 
 The number of local centres, on the uyezd or district level, with such experience is two or three per thousand, possibly more, but surely two or three can be found. 
 This experience must be thoroughly studied in a business-likefashion. 
 We must carefully sift the evidence and verifythe figures, and not rely merely on speeches by the opposi-tion. 
 If we do this, the centre will be able to learn. 
 I think the most important outcome of the debate has been the information we got on how the exchange of com-modities was begun; the only thing lacking was the precisefacts. 
 Donbas comrades cabled to say: We have obtained3,000 poods of wheat through exchange. 
 This referred toa small district, but there were no details. 
 I expected thecomrades to come forward here and tell us what they gave in return, and through what organisation the exchange was made: the Commissariat for Food, a lessee, conces-sionaire or private entrepreneur? This we do not know; andyet it is far more important than our decrees. 
 Decreescan be read, and it is hardly worth getting together todiscuss them; but it is certainly worth while to come together to discuss how they obtained 3,000 poods of wheat in the Donbas, and whether the comrades in Volhynia orTambov have not done better. 
 Quite a good deal has beendone locally. 
 The comrades should come here and tell usthe results of their practical experience over there. 
 Onewill say: “I started doing so and so, but was hindered by the central organisation. 
” Another will say: “I managed to bring the central organisation to heel. 
” As for TambovGubernia, the comrade who delivered a parliamentary speechand thundered against the Commissariat for Food vaguelyhinted that they had set up co-operative shops andagencies. 
 The comrades had accepted this. 
 Over there they have to put up with a number of additional difficulties; part of the area has not been sown, severe conditions gen-erally, handicap upon handicap. 
 Nevertheless, from whathe said it is evident that exchange has begun and the co-operatives are functioning. 
 Even pomade was mentioned. 
How much pomade did you take? And on what terms was it distributed? You must even trade in pomade; when you are trading you must reckon with the demand. 
 If there isa demand for pomade, we must supply it. 
 If we run things properly we can restore large-scale industry even with the aid of pomade. 
 What we must calculate, though, is how much of it we need to buy, or obtain, to be able to purchase 1,000 poods of grain. 
 ( Voice : What about icons; there’s a demand for icons. 
) As for icons, someone has just givena reminder that the peasants are asking for icons. 
 I thinkthat we should not follow the example of the capitalistcountries and put vodka and other intoxicants on the market, because, profitable though they are, they will lead us back to capitalism and not forward to communism; butthere is no such danger in pomade. 
 ( Laughter . 
) As for church bells, we differ on that, and some comrades think that insome places the bells will soon be voluntarily recast intocopper wire for electrification. 
 Besides, there are so many of them in Russia at the moment that they can hardly be used by religious people for their original purpose, because theneed is no longer there. 
 As regards Volhynia, it wasstated that there are places there where they give a poodof grain for ten pounds of salt. 
 But how was this trans-acted? Did you have any agents? How did you trade? Who looked after the goods? Who locked up the warehouses? How much was stolen? That is the main thing butnothing was said about it at all. 
 Instead, we were toldthat the Poles had given a pood of salt for a pood of grain. 
In conversation with the comrade I said that if the Polesoffered a pood of salt for a pood of grain and the peasants offered you a pood of grain for ten pounds of salt, then you could have traded something for yourselves. 
 What preventedyou from doing that? The centre, it was said. 
 I’m sorry butI simply cannot believe that the centre prevented you fromobtaining four poods of grain for a pood of Polish salt. 
We could not have opposed a thing like that; I refuse to believe it. 
 The comrades complained that before, when the army was there, everything had to be done throughthe military authorities; but now that the army is no longerthere and there is no war, permission must be obtainedfrom the centre. 
 A comrade said that now they had theSouthern Paper Trust and that they were fighting this Trust. 
 But when I asked to whom they had complained about this organisation he answered that he did not know. 
 Butthis is very important. 
 They were unable to name the body to whom they had sent their complaint about the Southern Paper Trust. 
 I do not know what this Paper Trust is. 
 In all probability it is a body that suffers from the same bureaucratic distortion thatall our Soviet organisations are afflicted with. 
 The capital-ists are still fighting us. 
 We have compelled many of themto seek protection under Milyukov’s wing abroad; butmany thousands are still here, waging war against us according to all the rules of the art of bureaucracy. 
 But how are you combating this, comrades? Do you think youcan take this Paper Trust and all the rest of them withyour bare hands? We did not fight Denikin with bare hands,but armed ourselves strongly, and organised an army. 
 Buthere we have excellent officials, who consider that it is in the interests of their class to play dirty tricks on us, to hamper our work; they think that they are saving civil-isation by helping to bring about the downfall of theBolsheviks, and they know how to run an office a hundredtimes better than we do. 
 There was nowhere for us to learnthis business. 
 We must fight them according to all the rules of the art and take proceedings against Party comrades who go about lodging complaints, or telling anecdotesabout the dirty tricks that are being played in some officeor other. 
 They go about Moscow telling anecdotes aboutthe bureaucratic tricks that are being played. 
 But you,comrades, who are intelligent Communists, what have you done to combat this?—“I lodged a complaint. 
”—Where did you file your complaint? It turns out that no complainthad been filed, whereas it should have been sent to the Coun-cil of People’s Commissars and to the All-Russia CentralExecutive Committee; in other words, they should haveexercised all their rights provided for by our Constitution. 
 Of course, we may suffer a reverse here and there in this war. 
 But has there ever been a war, even the most victorious,without any reverses? In this one reverses are also possible,but the fight must go on. 
 Many of us, however, are not tak-ing it seriously. 
 Have you taken legal proceedings againstthose who are responsible for red tape? Has any people’s court convicted anyone for making a worker or a peasant call at an office four or five times and finally sending himoff with an answer which is formally correct, but is essen-tially sheer mockery? You are Communists, aren’t you? Then why don’t you set a trap for these bureaucratic gen-tlemen and then haul them before a people’s court, and into prison, for this red tape? How many people have you putinto prison for red tape? Everyone will say, of course, thatit is a troublesome business: Someone may be offended. 
Many take this view, but do not find it too much troubleto complain and tell anecdotes. 
 Very often one cannot tell the difference between these anecdotes and the slander published by the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionariesin foreign journals. 
 The Mensheviks write: “We have ourown correspondents in all the Soviet offices in Moscow. 
”(Laughter . 
) Quite often the anecdotes that are told here, and those with which the speeches of the parliamentary opposition are replete, appear in the Menshevik journals a few days later. 
 But you should know where to drawthe line; you must see the difference between a seriousstruggle and the telling of anecdotes. 
 Of course, whenpeople are tired, an anecdote told by a capable speakermay help to let off steam. 
 Judging from my own observations this is so, and I have no objections from this point of view. 
 But we need something more: wemust study the methods used to catch the culprits, countup how many were caught and brought to trial, and sumup the results obtained. 
 If we proceed on these lines wewill win this war, although it takes far more skill than the Civil War. 
 I should like to say a word or two about Nikolayev- Gubernia. 
 The comrade from Nikolayev Gubernia gave us anumber of valuable facts, but in most cases he gave nodetails. 
 He said: “There is a demand for textiles and iron,but not for pomade. 
” Others said, however, that there was no demand for textiles. 
 The comrade came up against the profiteers, and being obliged to pursue the free marketpolicy, he wants to know how to combat them. 
 We cannotfight them in the old way; and to fight them in the newway we have mounted guards in the transport system, anda number of new decrees have been passed; but, of course, no quick results can be expected. 
 But where is your local experience in this matter? A number of decrees have nowbeen passed for the protection of the transport system, not against the profiteers, but against its “improper use”. 
 Special commissions, Extraordinary Three-Man Commis-sions have been set up by the Cheka and the Transport Cheka; the War Department and the People’s Commis-sariat for Railways are also taking a hand. 
 But what arethe bodies functioning in your districts? How do theyco-ordinate their work? What is being done about thecomplaints that the profiteers are getting the upper hand? How do they operate? This is what we ought to discuss. 
 But comrades come here and complain: “The profiteershave got the upper hand. 
” We have adopted the decrees. 
Perhaps they are no good, they must be put to the test,but how is this to be done? We test our decrees by pub-lishing them. 
 You know them; you come here to discuss them and tell us how they are applied. 
 You must tell us: in such and such a place, such and such a Transport Three-ManCommission has done the following. 
 In one place it wassuccessful, in another it was not. 
 Perhaps the speeches willnot be as brilliant as those we heard about the food dicta-torship; but unless we do this we shall never learn to make fewer mistakes in drafting decrees, and that is the main thing. 
 Let me deal in conclusion with the deductions which, I think, Comrade Osinsky has quite rightly drawn, andwhich sum up our activities. 
 His deductions were three. 
First: “Seriously and for a long time”. 
 I think he is quite right. 
 The policy is a long-term one and is being adopted in earnest. 
 We must get this well into our heads and rememberit, because, owing to the gossip habit, rumours are beingspread that we are indulging in a policy of expedients, thatis to say, political trickery, and that what is being done isonly for the present day. 
 That is not true. 
 We are taking class relationships into account and have our eyes on what the proletariat must do to lead the peasantry in the directionof communism in spite of everything. 
 Of course, we have toretreat; but we must take it very seriously and look at itfrom the standpoint of class forces. 
 To regard it as a trickis to imitate the philistines, the petty bourgeoisie, who are alive and kicking not only outside the Communist Party. 
 But I would not go along with Comrade Osinsky in hisestimate of the period. 
 He said “seriously and for a long time” meant 25 years. 
 I am not that pessimistic; I shall refrain from estimating the period, but I think his figure is a bit too pessimistic. 
 We shall be lucky to project our policy for some 5 or 10 years, because we usually fail to doso even for 5 weeks. 
 We must promote enterprising non-Party workers. 
 We must reiterate over and over again that, after all is said anddone, meetings, congresses and conferences held by the Communist Party and other organisations in Soviet Russia must not be what they have been in the past, and stillare, that is to say, assemblies with speeches in the spiritof parliamentary oppositions and the drawing up of resolu-tions. 
 We have so many resolutions that nobody eventakes the trouble to file them, let alone read them. 
 We must devote our attention to business and not to resolutions. 
 Under the bourgeois system, business matters were managedby private owners and not by state agencies; but now,business matters are our common concern. 
 These are thepolitics that interest us most. 
 Of course, we can denouncethe Mensheviks for the 999th time, they deserve it; but after all is said and done, this is mere repetition, and many of us have now been doing it these thirty years. 
Most of us have had enough of it. 
 What is much more interesting is how, in this socialist state, we are to exchange textiles, pomade and other thingsfor grain, and obtain an extra pood of flour in exchange for Polish salt. 
 Although it is not our custom, Party meetings must take up the question of enterprise andinitiative. 
 The whole capitalist world is starving. 
 Theyhave an abundance of salt, pomades, and other things ofthat sort, and if we apply the slogan of local exchangeproperly and show initiative, we shall obtain extra poods of grain. 
 Comrade Gusev has handed me a draft of the rules and regulations for a Communist Producers’ Co-operativeSociety. 
 Its substance is contained in Point 5, in whichthe members of the society ask to be assured a “healthy,hygienic ration”. 
 ( Laughter . 
) A “healthy, hygienic ration” is the goal of our whole food policy. 
 We must collect 240 million poods of grain by means of the tax, and 160 millionthrough commodity exchange, making a total of 400 million poods, so that the peasants may feel that this system is economically stable. 
 The surplus-grain appropriation system could not be continued any longer. 
 The policy had to be changed. 
 In thisrespect, we are facing what is, perhaps, the most difficultperiod of our construction effort. 
 If we were to comparethe whole work of the Communist Party to a four-yearcourse in the higher sciences, we could say that our present position is as follows: we are taking our examination to pass from the third course to the fourth; we have not yetpassed the examination, but there is every sign that weshall. 
 We can say that the first course lasted from the1870s to 1903; it was the initial introductory period,ranging from Narodnaya Volya, Social-Democracy and the Second International to Bolshevism. 
 That was the first course. 
 The second course lasted from 1903 to 1917, with a serious preparatory course for revolution, and the first essay inrevolution in 1905. 
 The third course lasted from 1917 to1921, a period of four years, which in content was more important than the first forty years. 
 This was a very practi-cal test, when the proletariat came to power, but it wasnot yet the crucial test. 
 Although in our anthem we sing:“The last fight let us face”, I must say that, unfortunately,it was not the last fight, but one of the fights just beforethe last, to be absolutely exact. 
 At present we are taking our examination to pass from the third course to the fourth. 
 Taking Osinsky’s example of years, I think we should allowten, because we shall have to take an exam to pass fromthe third course to the fourth. 
 After that we must do wellin the fourth course and then we shall really be invincible. 
We can win on the economic front. 
 If we are victorious in relation to the peasantry and collect a “healthy, hygienic ration” this year, we shall pass to the fourth course. 
 Afterthat, all the work of construction that we are planning willbe more serious. 
 This is the task confronting us. 
 That is why I take the liberty, once again, in conclusion to express the hope that, in spite of the difficulties, and all the old traditions which frown on the idea of discussing local questions of minoreconomics at congresses, conferences and fine parliamentary assemblies, we shall, nevertheless, say to ourselves: being Communists, we shall have to devote ourselves to these tasks. 
 We must study the practical experience gained in economic work in the localities, where the decrees are beingapplied, where they are tested, where their defects shouldbe rectified, where we must begin to do the things that arelater summed up at our meetings. 
 If we do that, our workof construction will make real and durable progress.

) 4 DRAFT RESOLUTION ON QUESTIONS OF THE NEW ECONOMIC POLICY 1. 
 The fundamental political task of the moment is for all Party and Soviet workers to gain a complete under-standing of the New Economic Policy and to implement it to the letter. 
 The Party regards this policy as being established for a long period of years, and demands that everyone shouldcarry it out unconditionally with thoroughness and diligence. 
 2. 
 Commodity exchange is brought to the fore as the principal lever of the New Economic Policy. 
 It is impos-sible to establish a correct relationship between the prole-tariat and the peasantry, or an altogether stable form ofeconomic alliance between these two classes in the periodof transition from capitalism to socialism, without regularcommodity exchange or the exchange of products between industry and agriculture. 
 The exchange of commodities, in particular, is required to stimulate the extension of the peasants’ area under cropand improvement of peasant farming. 
 Local initiative and enterprise must be given all-round support and development at all costs. 
 Gubernias with the greatest grain surpluses must be placed on the priority list for commodity exchange. 
 3. 
 Considering co-operatives to be the main apparatus for commodity exchange, the conference recognises as correctthe policy of contracts between the agencies of the People’sCommissariat for Food and the co-operative societies, and the transfer, under government control, by the former to the latter of commodity-exchange stocks to fulfil theassignments of the government; /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR the co-operatives to be given broad opportunities for procurement and all-round development of local industry and revival of economic life in general; support for credit operations by the co-operatives;anarchic commodity exchange (that is, exchange which eludes all control and state supervision) to be combated byconcentration of exchange chiefly in the hands of the co-operatives, without, however, any restrictions on regular free market operations; market analysis. 
 4. 
 Support for small and medium (private and co-operative) enterprises, chiefly those not requiring suppliesfrom state raw material, fuel and food reserves. 
 Permission to lease government enterprises to private persons, co-operatives, artels and associations. 
 The right of local economic agencies to conclude such contracts withoutauthorisation from superior agencies. 
 Obligatory notifica-tion of the Council of Labour and Defence in each suchcase. 
 5. 
 Review of (certain sections of) production programmes for large-scale industry towards increasing the manufac-ture of consumer goods and peasant household articles. 
 Extension of enterprise and initiative by each large establishment in the disposal of financial and materialresources. 
 Submission of a precise decree to that effectfor approval by the Council of People’s Commissars. 
 6. 
 Development of the system of bonuses in kind and the establishment by way of experiment of a collectivesupply system. 
 Establishment of a more correct distribution of food-stuffs with the aim of increasing labour productivity. 
 7. 
 The need to maintain and enlarge the apparatus for the full and expeditious collection of the tax in kind every-where. 
 Investment of food agencies with the necessaryParty authority for that purpose. 
 Maintenance and enhance-ment of the centralisation of the food apparatus. 
 8. 
 To concentrate all the enumerated measures on the current year’s practical and urgent task: collection of at least 400 million poods of grain stocks as a basis for the rehabilitation of large-scale industry and the implementa-tion of the electrification plan. 
 9. 
 To adopt in principle the draft Instructions of the C. 
L. 
D. 
, authorising the All-Russia Central Executive Committee group to enact them into law. 
 To recognise the strict fulfilment of the Instructions in general and the recruitment and promotion of non-Party people for work, in particular, as the Party’s uncon-ditional and primary task. 
 10. 
 To establish special responsibility on the part of central agencies for any hampering of local initiative and insufficient support of it. 
 To authorise the All-Russia CentralExecutive Committee group to work out a correspondingdecision and have it adopted at the very next session. 
 11. 
 The conference authorises the Central Committee and all Party organisations to carry out a system of measures to intensify agitation and propaganda and effect the neces-sary transfer of Party cadres to ensure complete understand-ing and steady implementation of the enumerated tasks. 
 12. 
 To set as the Party’s most important task the careful and all-round publicising and study in the press and attrade union, Soviet, and Party meetings, conferences, congresses, etc. 
, of the practical experience gained in economic development locally and at the centre. 
 First published in full according to page proofs with Lenin’s corrections 5 SPEECH IN CLOSING THE CONFERENCE MAY 28 Comrades, I think that I can confine myself to a very short speech. 
 As you are aware, we convened this special conference mainly for the purpose of achieving complete understanding on economic policy between the centre andthe localities, among Party and all Soviet workers. 
 I thinkthat the conference has fully achieved its object. 
 Somespeakers noted that Comrade Osinsky gave the correctexpression to the feelings of very many, probably, the ma-jority of local Party workers when he said that we must remove all doubt about the fact that the policy adoptedby the Tenth Party Congress and subsequently reinforcedby decrees and orders has unquestionably been acceptedby the Party in earnest and for a long time. 
 This is whatthe conference most emphatically expressed and amplified by a number of points. 
 When the comrades return to their localities, not the slightest possibility of wrong interpre-tation will remain. 
 Of course, in adopting a policy to bepursued over a number of years we do not for a momentforget that everything may be altered by the internationalrevolution, its rate of development and the circumstances accompanying it. 
 The current international situation is such that some sort of a temporary, unstable equilibrium, butequilibrium for all that, has been established; it is the kindof equilibrium under which the imperialist powers havebeen compelled to abandon their desire to hurl themselvesat Soviet Russia, despite their hatred for her, because the disintegration of the capitalist world is steadily progressing, unity is steadily diminishing, while the onslaught of theforces of the oppressed colonies, which have a population of over a thousand million, is increasing from year to year, month to month, and even week to week. 
 But we can make no conjectures on this score. 
 We are now exercising our main influence on the international revolution throughour economic policy. 
 The working people of all countrieswithout exception and without exaggeration are lookingto the Soviet Russian Republic. 
 This much has beenachieved. 
 The capitalists cannot hush up or conceal anything. 
 That is why they so eagerly catch at our every economic mistake and weakness. 
 The struggle in this fieldhas now become global. 
 Once we solve this problem, we shallhave certainly and finally won on an international scale. 
That is why for us questions of economic developmentbecome of absolutely exceptional importance. 
 On this front, we must achieve victory by a steady rise and progress which must be gradual and necessarily slow. 
 I think that as aresult of the work of our conference we shall certainlyachieve this goal.

 June 2, 1921 to the Pravda text SPEEC H ON LOCA L ECONOMI C BODIES DELIVERE D AT A SITTING OF THE ALL-RUSSIA CENTRA L EXECUTIV E COMMITTEE MAY 30, 1921118 Comrades, I have very little to add to what Comrade Osinsky has said, for he has already explained the preliminary draft of the Instructions, copies of whichyou have, and the main idea underlying it. 
 As there aredetails in this matter which virtually determine the wholeissue, it was decided not to limit its examination to the Council of Labour and Defence and the Council of People’s Commissars, but to bring it before the Party conference,where the Instructions were approved in principle, andbefore the supreme legislative body—the Session of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee. 
 Local workers mustmake a careful verification of the methods by which this law is to be implemented, and it may be necessary at first to lay down a number of supplementary rules. 
 Care must be taken that this measure is not, in any cir-cumstances, converted into just another source of increasedred tape. 
 This would not be unlikely if we were toreceive too many reports, or if the methods of compiling them did not guarantee that they could be checked. 
 Com-rades, we must give thought to the methods of compilingthe reports, and you may find it appropriate to elect aspecial commission which, guided by the suggestions thatwill be made here and the instructions and directives yougive it, will put the matter of the reports into final shape. 
 We already have a fair amount of material on this question. 
 Naturally, if reports are to be submitted, they must comenot only from the various economic bodies, but also from the People’s Commissariats, that is, including those which do not run branches of the economy but are nevertheless closely connected with economic work. 
 One of the main objects of printing the reports is to bring them within reachof the non-Party masses, and of the population in general. 
We cannot use mass production methods and print thesereports in large numbers, and so we must concentrate themin the libraries. 
 That being the case, we must arrange for brief printed summaries of these reports, giving the gist of what is of most interest to the population. 
 The technicalfacilities for this are available. 
 Before coming here to speakI made inquiries of the representative of the Central PaperBoard. 
 He has sent me a precise report covering 339 uyezdcentres, and showing that each of these has the printing faci-lities and the paper to print very brief reports. 
 He has based his calculations on the assumption that the smallest of theseuyezd centres would print 16 pages in octavo, once a month,of course. 
 But once a month is too often. 
 Whether youdecide on once in two months, or in four, or perhaps evena longer period, will evidently be determined by the reports we get from the localities. 
 He has assumed that there would be 1,000 copies, and has accordingly estimated thatthe required quantity of paper is now available. 
 A thou-sand copies would enable us to supply these reports at leastto every uyezd library and so bring them within the reachof all who are interested in them, particularly the masses of non-Party people. 
 Of course, this will initially have to be an experiment; no one can guarantee that it will besuccessful at once, and that there will be no defects. 
 To conclude my brief supplementary remarks I should like to emphasise one other thing. 
 One of the most importanttasks confronting us at present is that of massive enlistment of non-Party people for this work, ensuring that apart from Party members and in any case officials of the departmentconcerned, the largest possible number of non-Party peopleshould have an interest in the work and be enlisted in it. 
It appeared to us that this could not be achieved in anyway except by publishing the reports, at any rate, the more essential part of them. 
 Some establishments send in ex-tremely full reports. 
 All the information that we have hadon this question up to now shows that some local bodies are excellently organised. 
 At all events, the work in the localities is constantly providing us with a great deal of very encouraging material. 
 What we really lack is the abil-ity to publicise the best examples—which are not many—and set them up as models which all should be obliged toemulate. 
 Our press does not publicise these really exem-plary local organisations which have practical experience. 
Printing these reports and bringing them within the reach of the broad masses of the population, by supplying copies to every library, if only on the uyezd level, should help—provided conferences of non-Party people are properly con-vened—to enlist far greater numbers in the economic drive. 
Any number of resolutions have been passed on thissubject. 
 In some places, something has been done, but taking the country as a whole, certainly far too little is being done. 
 By this method, however, we shall improvethe work of the establishments and make it possible forevery local worker in every responsible economic post toprovide the centre with signed reports containing preciseand definite information on his practical experience, which could be used as a model. 
 This seems to be what we lack most at the present time. 
 Let us leave it to practice to decide how these reports are subsequently to be summarised and studied, and utilisedat conferences, congresses and by establishments. 
 Con-sidering the available experience of local workers, the main thing now is to approve this decree and put it to the test and be sure to obtain results by the forthcoming All-RussiaCongress (some time next December) which would showjust how this measure could be developed, improved,modified and enlarged on the basis of experience. 
 These are the brief supplementary remarks that I should like to confine myself to for the time being.

 Moscow, 1922 SPEEC H DELIVERE D AT THE THIRD ALL-RUSSI A FOO D CONFERENCE JUN E 16, 1921119 Comrades, first of all permit me to greet your conference on behalf of the Council of People’s Commissars and of the Central Committee of the R. 
C. 
P. 
 Comrades, we all understand, of course, why such special attention should be paid to your conference, not only bythose who are engaged in food supply work, but by allSoviet and Party workers, by the whole Party, and by all those who are at all seriously concerned about the fate of the Soviet Republic and its tasks. 
 Your conference has metat a moment of exceptional importance, and for that reasonit cannot possibly be regarded as an ordinary, or regularfood conference, like any you have attended in the past,and will no doubt attend again in the future. 
 The exceptional importance of your present conference is due to two circumstances. 
 The first is an unavoidableone—what we feared—the fact that for the second yearour country is afflicted by a disaster that entails grave hard-ships. 
 We do not know whether we are in for a long cycleof drought, as has been predicted these two years, but it is now clear that the grain and hay crop will fail in a large area of the country for the second year running, and theprospects are menacing. 
 I will not say just now how large is the area which, according to the grain and hay crop reports, is affected by the drought; at all events, it isconsiderable. 
 Whatever it is, the prospect is that in many gubernias there will be a large deficit in the tax in kind, and, moreover, the condition of the population in a number ofgubernias will be desperate; so that, instead of collecting a certain quantity of surplus produce from these gubernias for the maintenance of the army, the working class and industry, the food supply workers will have to assist the starving in these gubernias. 
 The unanticipated tasks whichthus devolve upon you, as food supply workers, will makeyour work much more arduous. 
 This is the first circumstance. 
 The second circumstance, which is not as unexpected, is the moment of change, the turning point that has been reached, in our whole food policy. 
 This is the first food campaign to be launched since the radical change inour food policy. 
 This is the first time we have met to sumup the experience of local food supply workers and toprepare for our forthcoming tasks since the Soviet govern-ment was obliged to change, not only its food policy but, in many respects, the very principles of its economic policy; since the extremely severe hardships the peasants sufferedlast year, and the impossibility, as it turned out, of rap-idly restoring large-scale industry, compelled us to switchall our state work to new lines Reckoning with the gravity of the situation in the coun-try and the impossibility of rapidly restoring large-scale industry, means making preparations to help small-peasantfarming, at all costs, at any price, pull out of its criticalposition to a bearable one, and for this purpose to revivesmall, local industry, and adopt measures which, by atonce placing small production on a sound basis, would open up opportunities for local trade, thereby enlarging the sphere for the investment of capital, and also switching tonew lines the whole Soviet power—its very foundations,and its entire economic policy. 
 You are well aware of the effort it has cost us all, and you particularly, during the past three years to build up something like a stable food supply apparatus and to run it so that it might fulfil at least the most urgent and essen-tial tasks. 
 Hence, there is no need to tell you, who havebeen in the thick of all this, what it means quickly to reor-ganise all our work and switch it over to new lines; whatit means to organise amidst so many unknowns, and, at the same time, to solve the problem of obtaining a larger quantity of food. 
 You know all about it. 
 Year after year,in spite of the terrible, unprecedented, sometimes super-human difficulties created by the Civil War, our food policy has produced striking and tangible results, and the improvement has been far more rapid than in any other sphere of Soviet work. 
 But you also know, of course,that although, as a result of the strenuous efforts of thefood supply workers, we have succeeded in raising graincollections from 110 million poods in the first year to over280 million poods, you know very well that this is not enough. 
 We are now, for the first time, entering on a big food supply campaign without any whiteguard troops or foreignarmies on the territory of the R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
 But to this mustbe added some reservations: except for the interventionstarted by the Japanese in the Far Eastern Republic. 
 Which shows again that in the very first year when we can say that, on the whole, we have done with the Civil War, it becomesevident that we are surrounded by the international bour-geoisie, whom the Red Army taught a harsh lesson, but whohas not by any means abandoned the idea of resuming theattack, in open or undercover, systematic or sporadic form, at the very first opportunity. 
 So even here we have no sure guarantee. 
 But in addition to all this you know that the verytransition from war to economic development, the transitionabout which we talked so long, and to which we devotedseveral Party conferences and congresses, this transitionin itself, is a transition, created fresh difficulties of vast proportions because, with a dislocated state apparatus and transport a shambles, enormous difficulties arose fromthe very transition from the old, large army, ranged on thefrontier in battle formation, to a peace-time army. 
 Thesigns are that we have overcome most of these difficulties;nevertheless, as anyone familiar with the situation will agree, quite a number of difficulties still confront us. 
 That is why I say that this food conference is excep-tionally important, that it must settle other questionsbesides those specifically connected with the food supply,that your attention and efforts on behalf of the Republicare required not only in your capacity of food supply work-ers, and men on whom the Soviet government has placed the crucial task of supplying the population with food. 
I say that this is not enough. 
 You as Party workers must exert all your efforts to fulfil a number of tasks which so far exist only in the form of instructions and decisions adopted by the supreme organs of the Soviet power and by the Party. 
 And you know perfectly well what a wide gap thereis between general decisions, general instructions, and theirpractical application. 
 You are aware that this entailsenormous effort, which must be exerted in order to putthese principles successfully into practice, to prevent them from remaining a dead letter, as, unfortunately, often happens in Soviet Russia. 
 I should like to remind you of the decision adopted by the last Party Conference, which dealt specifically with thequestion of the New Economic Policy. 
 120 The Party con-ference was called urgently for the purpose of convincing all comrades that this policy had been adopted, as was said at the conference, in earnest and for a long time andto prevent any wavering on that score in future, for therehas been some wavering and uncertainty. 
 The Party con-ference, as the supreme organ of the ruling, governmentParty, the leading authority of the working class, empha-sised the importance of collecting the large food stock of 400 million poods. 
 It laid emphasis on the point that thewhole meaning of our food policy, permitting a largemeasure of unrestricted trade, boils down to building up abig food fund, as a large state reserve. 
 Without it, neitherthe restoration of large-scale industry nor the restoration of the currency will be possible, and every socialist understands that unless large-scale industry—the only realbasis—is restored, it is no use talking about socialistconstruction. 
 No country has been so devastated as ours. 
 It had been more backward than other countries before the imperialist war, which brought it more ruin than it did to any other country, and in addition we had to endure the untold hard-ships of another three years of war against the bourgeoisieand the landowners. 
 The vanquished countries with whichRussia might be compared, countries like Serbia andAustria—where industry has been ruined to an extent equal to, and in some cases even greater than, that of Russia—are in desperate straits. 
 Counting on the assistance of the bour-geoisie—for they did not rise against it—they are crushed by a double burden: starvation, ruin and impoverishment (as in our case), plus the realisation that their position is hopeless, that they had put their stake on the bourgeoisie and are perishing without any prospects of assistance. 
 But,in spite of all our incredible difficulties, we see and clearlyrealise, and the mass of workers and peasants clearly realise—in spite of our incredible difficulties fresh forces arearising. 
 Every difficulty brought to life fresh forces, created new sources of energy and indicated new paths. 
 The work these forces have performed proves to us that, terriblyslow though it is, we are making progress, that frightfullyhard though it may be to overcome difficulties at times,we are nevertheless overcoming them. 
 There is a growingrealisation that economic relationships are being built upon entirely new lines, that great as its sufferings may be, the working class is, step by step, day after day, finding solu-tions for all problems without the aid of the capitalists,and is fighting them, and dislodging them from oneposition after another. 
 This, comrades, seems to me to be the sum and substance of the decisions adopted by the Party conference. 
 And with this I want particularly to emphasise that the presentconference is not only a conference of specialists, but ofParty and Soviet workers upon whom will devolve the prac-tical task of building, under extremely difficult conditions,the new forms of economic policy and the foundation of the whole Soviet edifice. 
 We shall have to build in two ways: by collecting the tax and by reviving commodity exchange. 
 The tax has beenfixed, on the assumption of an average harvest, at 240million poods, which is inadequate even for a short rationfor the army which we need, and for the absolutely essential industrial enterprises. 
 It will be difficult to collect this amount in full, not only in view of the threatening cropfailure, but under any circumstances. 
 I have not got the exact figures before me showing the changes in the percentages of fulfilment of our food supplyplans and assignments according to districts during the three years that we have been carrying on food supply operations. 
 But everyone knows that the machinery we havecreated by our joint efforts is running far more smoothly than that of a number of other People’s Commissariats, and that our efficiency is steadily increasing. 
 I also take it as an irrefutable fact that this year, when so much attention is being devoted to this work, we shall cope morefully with the tasks the Republic has set us. 
 We must achieve,if not 100 per cent, then as near to that figure as possible;and we can achieve it, even amidst the difficulties createdby the threatening failure of the harvest. 
 The tax deficit may run to tens of millions of poods, but this may be balanced by the extra amount that is likely to be collectedin areas where the harvest has been particularly good. 
 Comrades, the harvest absolutely refuses to reckon with the state of the food supply apparatus, and it has not givenus the satisfaction of being particularly good where the food supply apparatus is particularly good. 
 If we look at the chart indicating the harvest prospects we shall findthat the areas of the R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
 and of neighbouring andfraternal republics where the harvest outlook is partic-ularly good, or is above the average, are the very regionswhere the food supply apparatus is certainly not above the average, but even below it. 
 Vigorous measures must be taken to transfer extra food supply workers to theseareas, but we know too few people who are sufficientlytrained and experienced to adapt themselves to the newareas quickly and get things moving at once. 
 This is amatter that requires very close attention. 
 The main thing is commodity exchange, and it is this the Party conference put into the forefront and the last PartyCongress decided. 
 It is the question that is engaging mostof the concern and attention of all those who are at thehead of Soviet and Party work in Moscow. 
 How well arewe prepared for it? What has been actually done? What part of these plans has been carried out? You will be the first to have to answer these questions from first-hand experience. 
Your experience in this matter and its summing up willbe of particular and vital importance. 
 This is a new field, and additional forces must be sent in. 
 It demands that the food supply apparatus should be something more than it has been up to now—nothing but a more or less uniform and smoothly running machinefor collecting a quantity of food Products. 
 No, here you will have to take account of the difference in the localities, in the goods demanded and the equivalents offered. 
 You will not have to adjust yourselves to what the Soviet government wants, and to what the Soviet apparatuscan carry out. 
 No, you will have to adjust yourselves tothe economic conditions of the small farmers, and will haveto reckon with their satisfied and outstanding needs. 
 Youhave fought the profiteers and have combated trade conducted in contravention of government orders. 
 You will have to go on fighting them. 
 But in order to engage in theexchange of commodities and avoid being beaten in thefree market—which means being beaten by unrestrictedtrade—you must know it thoroughly, compete with it,fight it with its own weapons and beat it at its own game, but to be able to do that you must have a thorough knowledge of it. 
 The old bureaucratic methods are of no use; we need precise knowledge of commercial conditions and the abilityto react quickly to every change. 
 For this purpose, foodproducts and articles for exchange must be rapidly trans-ported from place to place over the vast territory of the R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
 The difficulties ahead of us are enormous. 
But this will be the basis of the whole of our New EconomicPolicy for the period until we fully restore large-scaleindustry. 
 This may take at least ten years, during whichtime we must create such relations between the working class and the peasantry—the only classes that can serve as a base on which to build up our economy—and suchan alliance between them as will economically satisfy bothsides. 
 It must be an alliance in which the small peasantwill be reckoned with as a small peasant, until we are ableto provide him with all the products of large-scale industry. 
 We must reckon with the small proprietor who sells his surplus products. 
 We must also reckon with the need toimprove the condition of the urban population—the workers. 
Unless we do this, we shall fail in our further work ofconstruction that will so consolidate the transition tosocialism that there will be no turning back. 
 That is why commodity exchange is now the most important part of our economic policy. 
 This is the task you, food supply work-ers, business managers and co-operators, will have to tackle. 
 This is what the Soviet government, the Party, and the whole Republic expect of you, for your attitude to this work and your successes will determine the success of what the Soviet Republic is now staking everything on in thework of socialist construction. 
 Comrades, I must say in conclusion that your conference has a special task before it: to consider a matter that wasraised in the Political Bureau of the Party’s Central Com-mittee in May, and settled, after discussion on the Central Committee, at the All-Russia Congress of Trade Unions. 
It is to set to work, with due circumspection and verygradually, but immediately, to try out the system of col-lective supplies. 
 The present system of food distributionhas proved to be defective, and this cannot go on. 
 The system of distributing food on the egalitarian principle has led to equalisation, which sometimes proves to be an obsta-cle to increasing output. 
 The Republic must utilise the foodsurpluses it collects to maintain only what is needed forindustry. 
 We cannot maintain all our factories, nor is itnecessary to do so: that would be wasteful management. 
 We cannot restore the whole of large-scale industry, and so we must select and maintain only those factories which havethe best equipment and promise a greater output. 
 Food supply workers cannot just go on thinking that their business boils down to collecting so many millionsof poods and distributing them in certain fixed rations, on the present ration cards, say, and that there is the end of it. 
 The immediate thing is to integrate the activity of all theeconomic People’s Commissariats. 
 The conscientious foodsupply worker must not only be interested in food supplywork, but in all economic activity. 
 More is expected ofhim now. 
 He cannot go on being only a food supply worker. 
 He must be an economist appraising every step in the light ofthe work of all the economic People’s Commissariats, andof all the results achieved by that work. 
 It is wrong to think that food distribution is only a matter of fairness. 
 We must bear in mind that it is a method, an instrument, and a means of increasing output. 
 State food supplies must be given only to those employees who arereally needed, on the condition that productivity of labour is increased to the utmost. 
 And if the distribution of food is to be used as a political instrument, then it must be used to reduce the number of those who are not absolutely needed and to encourage those who actually are. 
 If the distributionof food is a political instrument for restoring our industry,then we must maintain the industrial enterprises whichare really needed now, and certainly stop maintainingthose we do not need now, and thus economise fuel and food. 
 For a number of years we have been managing these things very badly. 
 This must now be rectified. 
 Thus, you see that the closer you look into the matter the wider you find the tasks confronting your food confer-ence. 
 I hope, however, that none of you will be intimidatedby the complexity of these tasks, and that, on the contrary, the unusual nature of your tasks as Soviet and Party work-ers will stimulate you to fresh efforts to fulfil them. 
 Ourpast experience of the work of other People’s Commis-sariats clearly proves the necessity of combining Soviet andParty work. 
 Food supply workers have carried out a num-ber of urgent tasks under extremely difficult conditions; and they did it successfully because in these cases the Soviet and Party bodies resorted to unconventional methods,urgent measures and shock-work campaign operations. 
 Irepeat that it is the fundamental basis of our economicpolicy that is the main subject of your food conference. 
 Itmust engage all your attention. 
 In conclusion, permit me to express the conviction that our united efforts in the direction we have taken will laya firm foundation for a successful economic policy that willcreate an alliance between the working class and the peas-antry, the two main classes on which the Soviet powerrests, the economic alliance which alone can guarantee the success of all our work of socialist construction.

 at present is distinguished by a certain equilibrium, which, althoughextremely unstable, has nevertheless given rise to a pe-culiar state of affairs in world politics. 
 This peculiarity is the following. 
 On the one hand, the international bourgeoisie is filled with furious hatred of, and hostility towards, Soviet Russia, and is prepared at any moment to fling itself upon her in order to strangle her. 
On the other hand, all attempts at military intervention,which have cost the international bourgeoisie hundredsof millions of francs, ended in complete failure, in spiteof the fact that the Soviet power was then weaker than it is now and that the Russian landowners and capitalists had whole armies on the territory of the R.

 Oppositionto the war against Soviet Russia has grown considerablyin all capitalist countries, adding fuel to the revolutionarymovement of the proletariat and extending to very widesections of the petty-bourgeois democrats. 
 The conflict of interests between the various imperialist countries has become acute, and is growing more acute every day. 
 Therevolutionary movement among the hundreds of millionsof oppressed peoples of the East is growing with remarkablevigour. 
 The result of all these conditions is that interna-tional imperialism has proved unable to strangle Soviet Russia, although it is far stronger, and has been obliged for the time being to grant her recognition, or semi-recognition,and to conclude trade agreements with her. 
 The result is a state of equilibrium which, although highly unstable and precarious, enables the Socialist Republic to exist—not for long, of course—within the capitalist encirclement. 
 2. 
 THE INTERNATIONAL ALIGNMENT OF CLASS FORCES This state of affairs has given rise to the following inter-national alignment of class forces. 
 The international bourgeoisie, deprived of the oppor-tunity of waging open war against Soviet Russia, is waitingand watching for the moment when circumstances willpermit it to resume the war. 
 The proletariat in all the advanced capitalist countries has already formed its vanguard, the Communist Parties, which are growing, making steady progress towards winningthe majority of the proletariat in each country, and destroy-ing the influence of the old trade union bureaucrats and ofthe upper stratum of the working class of America andEurope, which has been corrupted by imperialist privileges. 
 The petty-bourgeois democrats in the capitalist countries, whose foremost sections are represented by the Secondand Two-and-a-Half Internationals, serve today as themainstay of capitalism, since they retain an influence overthe majority, or a considerable section, of the industrial andcommercial workers and office employees who are afraid that if revolution breaks out they will lose the relative petty-bourgeois prosperity created by the privileges ofimperialism. 
 But the growing economic crisis is worseningthe condition of broad sections of the people everywhere,and this, with the looming inevitability of new imperialistwars if capitalism is preserved, is steadily weakening this mainstay. 
 The masses of the working people in the colonial and semi-colonial countries, who constitute the overwhelming major-ity of the population of the globe, were roused to politicallife at the turn of the twentieth century, particularly bythe revolutions in Russia, Turkey, Persia and China. 
 The imperialist war of 1914-18 and the Soviet power in Russia are completing the process of converting these masses intoan active factor in world politics and in the revolutionary destruction of imperialism, although the educated philis-tines of Europe and America, including the leaders of the Second and Two-and-a-Half Internationals, stubbornly refuse to see this. 
 British India is at the head of thesecountries, and there revolution is maturing in proportion, onthe one hand, to the growth of the industrial and railwayproletariat, and, on the other, to the increase in the brutalterrorism of the British, who with ever greater frequency resort to massacres (Amritsar), 122 public floggings, etc. 
 3. 
 THE ALIGNMENT OF CLASS FORCES IN RUSSIA The internal political situation in Soviet Russia is deter-mined by the fact that here, for the first time in history, there have been, for a number of years, only two classes— the proletariat, trained for decades by a very young, butmodern, large-scale machine industry, and the smallpeasantry, who constitute the overwhelming majority ofthe population. 
 In Russia, the big landowners and capitalists have not vanished, but they have been subjected to total expropria-tion and crushed politically as a class, whose remnants arehiding out among Soviet government employees. 
 They havepreserved their class organisation abroad, as émigrés, num-bering probably from 1,500,000 to 2,000,000 people, withover 50 daily newspapers of all bourgeois and “socialist” (i. 
e. 
, petty-bourgeois) parties, the remnants of an army, and numerous connections with the international bourgeoisie. 
These émigrés are striving, with might and main, to destroythe Soviet power and restore capitalism in Russia. 
 4. 
 THE PROLETARIAT AND THE PEASANTRY IN RUSSIA This being the internal situation in Russia, the main task now confronting her proletariat, as the ruling class,is properly to determine and carry out the measures that arenecessary to lead the peasantry, establish a firm alliancewith them and achieve the transition, in a series of gradual stages, to large-scale, socialised, mechanised agriculture. 
 This is a particularly difficult task in Russia, both becauseof her backwardness, and her extreme state of ruin as a result of seven years of imperialist and civil war. 
 But apart from these specific circumstances, this is one of the most difficult tasks of socialist construction that will con-front all capitalist countries, with, perhaps, the sole excep-tion of Britain. 
 However, even in regard to Britain it mustnot be forgotten that, while the small tenant farmers thereconstitute only a very small class, the percentage of workers and office employees who enjoy a petty-bourgeois standard of living is exceptionally high, due to the actualenslavement of hundreds of millions of people in Britain’s colonial possessions. 
 Hence, from the standpoint of development of the world proletarian revolution as a single process, the epoch Russiais passing through is significant as a practical test and averification of the policy of a proletariat in power towardsthe mass of the petty bourgeoisie. 
 5. 
 THE MILITARY ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE PROLETARIAT AND THE PEASANTRY IN THE R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
 The basis for proper relations between the proletariat and the peasantry in Soviet Russia was created in theperiod of 1917-21 when the invasion of the capitalists and landowners, supported by the whole world bourgeoisie and all the petty-bourgeois democratic parties (Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks), caused the proletariat andthe peasantry to form, sign and seal a military alliance todefend the Soviet power. 
 Civil war is the most intense formof class struggle, but the more intense it is, the more rap-idly its flames consume all petty-bourgeois illusions and prejudices, and the more clearly experience proves even tothe most backward strata of the peasantry that only thedictatorship of the proletariat can save it, and that theSocialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks are in fact merelythe servants of the landowners and capitalists. 
 But while the military alliance between the proletariat and the peasantry was—and had perforce to be—the pri-mary form of their firm alliance, it could not have been main-tained even for a few weeks without an economic alliancebetween the two classes. 
 The peasants received from theworkers’ state all the land and were given protection against the landowners and the kulaks; the workers have been receiving from the peasants loans of food supplies until large-scale industry is restored. 
 6. 
 THE TRANSITION TO PROPER ECONOMIC RELATIONS BETWEEN THE PROLETARIAT AND THE PEASANTRY The alliance between the small peasants and the proletariat can become a correct and stable one from thesocialist standpoint only when the complete restoration oftransport and large-scale industry enables the proletariatto give the peasants, in exchange for food, all the goodsthey need for their own use and for the improvement of their farms. 
 With the country in ruins, this could not pos-sibly be achieved at once. 
 The surplus appropriation systemwas the best measure available to the insufficiently organ-ised state to maintain itself in the incredibly arduous waragainst the landowners. 
 The crop failure and the foddershortage in 1920 particularly increased the hardships of the peasantry, already severe enough, and made the immediate transition to the tax in kind imperative. 
 The moderate tax in kind will bring about a big improve-ment in the condition of the peasantry at once, and will atthe same time stimulate them to enlarge crop areas andimprove farming methods. 
 The tax in kind signifies a transition from the requisition of all the peasants’ surplus grain to regular socialist exchangeof products between industry and agriculture. 
 7. 
 THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT CAN PERMIT CAPITALISM AND CONCESSIONS, AND THE SIGNIFICANCE THEREOF Naturally, the tax in kind means freedom for the peasant to dispose of his after-tax surplus at his own discretion. 
Since the state cannot provide the peasant with goodsfrom socialist factories in exchange for all his surplus, freedom to trade with this surplus necessarily means freedom for the development of capitalism. 
 Within the limits indicated, however, this is not at all dangerous for socialism as long as transport and large-scaleindustry remain in the hands of the proletariat. 
 On the contrary, the development of capitalism, controlled and regulated by the proletarian state (i. 
e. 
, “state” capitalism in this sense of the term), is advantageous and necessary in an extremely devastated and backward small-peasantcountry (within certain limits, of course), inasmuch as it iscapable of hastening the immediate revival of peasant farm-ing. 
 This applies still more to concessions: without dena-tionalising anything, the workers’ state leases certain mines, forest tracts, oilfields, and so forth, to foreign capitalists in order to obtain from them extra equipment and machinerythat will enable us to accelerate the restoration of Sovietlarge-scale industry. 
 The payment made to the concessionaires in the form of a share of the highly valuable products obtained is undoubtedly tribute, which the workers’ state pays to the world bourgeoisie; without in any way glossing this over,we must clearly realise that we stand to gain by payingthis tribute, so long as it accelerates the restoration of ourlarge-scale industry and substantially improves the condi-tion of the workers and peasants. 
 8. 
 THE SUCCESS OF OUR FOOD POLICY The food policy pursued by Soviet Russia in 1917-21 was undoubtedly very crude and imperfect, and gave rise to many abuses. 
 A number of mistakes were made in its imple-mentation. 
 But as a whole, it was the only possible policyunder the conditions prevailing at the time. 
 And it didfulfil its historic mission: it saved the proletarian dicta-torship in a ruined and backward country. 
 There can beno doubt that it has gradually improved. 
 In the first year that we had full power (August 1, 1918 to August 1, 1919) the state collected 110 million poods of grain; in the secondyear it collected 220 million poods, and in the third year—over 285 million poods. 
 Now, having acquired practical experience, we have set out, and expect, to collect 400 million poods (the tax in kind is expected to bring in 240 million poods). 
 Only when it is actually in possession of an adequate stock offood will the workers’ state be able to stand firmly on its own feet economically, secure the, steady, if slow, restora-tion of large-scale industry, and create a proper financial system. 
 9. 
 THE MATERIAL BASIS OF SOCIALISM AND THE PLAN FOR THE ELECTRIFICATION OF RUSSIA A large-scale machine industry capable of reorganising agriculture is the only material basis that is possible for socialism. 
 But we cannot confine ourselves to this generalthesis. 
 It must be made more concrete. 
 Large-scale industrybased on the latest achievements of technology and capableof reorganising agriculture implies the electrification of thewhole country. 
 We had to undertake the scientific work of drawing up such a plan for the electrification of the R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
 and we have accomplished it. 
 With the co-oper-ation of over two hundred of the best scientists, engineers andagronomists in Russia, this work has now been completed; itwas published in a large volume and, as a whole, endorsedby the Eighth All-Russia Congress of Soviets in Decem-ber 1920. 
 Arrangements have now been made to convene an all-Russia congress of electrical engineers in August 1921to examine this plan in detail, before it is given final govern-ment endorsement. 
 The execution of the first part of theelectrification scheme is estimated to take ten years, andwill require about 370 million man-days. 
 In 1918, we had eight newly erected power stations (with a total capacity of 4,757 kw); in 1919, the figure roseto 36 (total capacity of 1,648 kw), and in 1920, it rose to 100(total capacity of 8,699 kw). 
 Modest as this beginning is for our vast country, a start has been made, work has begun and is making steady progress. 
 After the imperialist war, after a million prisoners of war in Germany had become familiar with modern up-to-date technique, after the stern but hardening experienceof three years of civil war, the Russian peasant is a differ-ent man. 
 With every passing month he sees more clearlyand more vividly that only the guidance given by the prole-tariat is capable of leading the mass of small farmers out of capitalist slavery to socialism. 
 10. 
 THE ROLE OF “PURE DEMOCRACY”, THE SECOND AND TWO -AND -A-HALF INTERNATIONALS, THE SOCIALIST -REVOLUTIONARIES AND THE MENSHEVIKS AS THE ALLIES OF CAPITAL The dictatorship of the proletariat does not signify a ces-sation of the class struggle, but its continuation in a newform and with new weapons. 
 This dictatorship is essential as long as classes exist, as long as the bourgeoisie, over-thrown in one country, intensifies tenfold its attacks onsocialism on an international scale. 
 In the transition period,the small farmer class is bound to experience certain vacil-lations. 
 The difficulties of transition, and the influence ofthe bourgeoisie, inevitably cause the mood of this mass to change from time to time. 
 Upon the proletariat, enfeebled and to a certain extent declassed by the destruction ofthe large-scale machine industry, which is its vital foun-dation, devolves the very difficult but paramount historictask of holding out in spite of these vacillations, and ofcarrying to victory its cause of emancipating labour from the yoke of capital. 
 The policy pursued-by the petty-bourgeois democratic parties, i. 
e. 
, the parties affiliated to the Second and Two-and-a-Half Internationals, represented in Russia by theS. 
R. 
 (Socialist-Revolutionary) and Menshevik parties, is thepolitical expression of the vacillations of the petty bourgeoi-sie. 
 These parties now have their headquarters and news-papers abroad, and are actually in a bloc with the wholeof the bourgeois counter-revolution and are serving itloyally. 
 The shrewd leaders of the Russian big bourgeoisie headed by Milyukov, the leader of the Cadet (Constitutional-Democratic) Party, have quite clearly, definitely and openly appraised this role of the petty-bourgeois democrats, i. 
e. 
,the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks. 
 In connectionwith the Kronstadt mutiny, in which the Mensheviks,Socialist-Revolutionaries and whiteguards, joined forces,Milyukov declared in favour of the “Soviets without the Bolsheviks” slogan. 
 Elaborating on the idea, he wrote that the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks “arewelcome to try” ( Pravda No. 
 64, 1921, quoted from the Paris Posledniye Novosti 123), because upon them devolves the task of first taking power away from the Bolsheviks. 
 Milyukov, the leader of the big bourgeoisie, has correctlyappraised the lesson taught by all revolutions, namely,that the petty-bourgeois democrats are incapable of hold-ing power, and always serve merely as a screen for the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, and a stepping stone to its undivided power. 
 The proletarian revolution in Russia again and again confirms this lesson of 1789-94 and 1848-49, and also what Frederick Engels said in his letter to Bebel of December 11, 1884. 
 ...“Pure democracy ... when the moment of revolution comes, acquires a temporary importance ... as the finalsheet-anchor of the whole bourgeois and even feudal econ-omy.... 
 Thus between March and September 1848 the whole feudal-bureaucratic mass strengthened the liberals in order to hold down the revolutionary masses .... 
 In any case our sole adversary on the day of the crisis andon the day after the crisis will be the whole of the reactionwhich will group around pure democracy, and this, I think,should not be lost sight of.

 Lenin Moscow, Kremlin, June 13, 1921 2 SPEECH ON THE ITALIAN QUESTION JUNE 28 Comrades, I should like to reply mainly to Comrade Lazzari. 
 He said: “Quote concrete facts, not words. 
” Excellent. 
 But if we trace the development of the reformist-opportunist trend in Italy, what will that be, words or facts? In your speeches and in the whole of your policy you losesight of the fact, which is so important for the socialist move-ment in Italy, that not only this trend, but an opportunist-reformist group has existed for quite a long time. 
 Istill very well remember the time when Bernstein started his opportunist propaganda, which ended in social-patriotism, in the treason and bankruptcy of the Second International. 
We have known Turati ever since, not only by name,but for his propaganda in the Italian party and in theItalian working-class movement, of which he has been adisrupter for the past twenty years. 
 Lack of time prevents me from closely studying the material concerning the Italian party; but I think that one of the most important docu-ments on this subject is a report, published in a bourgeoisItalian newspaper—I don’t remember which, La Stampa125 or Corriere della Sera126—of the conference held by Turati and his friends in Reggio Emilia. 
127 I compared that report with the one published in Avanti!128 Is this not proof enough? After the Second Congress of the CommunistInternational, we, in our controversy with Serrati and hisfriends, openly and definitely told them what, in our opin-ion, the situation was. 
 We told them that the Italian partycould not become a Communist Party as long as it tolerated people like Turati in its ranks. 
 What is this, political facts, or again just words? After the Second Congress of the Communist International we openly said to the Italian proletariat: “Don’t unite with the reformists, with Turati. 
” Serrati launched a series of articles in the Italian press in opposition to the Communist Inter-national and convened a special conference of reformists. 
129 Was all this mere words? It was something more than asplit: it was the creation of a new party. 
 One must havebeen blind not to have seen this. 
 This document is of de-cisive importance for this question. 
 All those who attended the Reggio Emilia conference must be expelled from the party; they are Mensheviks—not Russian, but ItalianMensheviks. 
 Lazzari said: “We know the Italian people’smentality. 
” For my part I would not dare to make suchan assertion about the Russian people, but that is notimportant. 
 “Italian Socialists understand the spirit of the Italian people very well,” said Lazzari. 
 Perhaps they do, I will not argue about that. 
 But they do not know ItalianMenshevism, if the concrete facts and the persistent refusal toeradicate Menshevism is anything to go by. 
 We are obligedto say that—deplorable though it may be—the resolution ofour Executive Committee must be confirmed. 
 A party which tolerates opportunists and reformists like Turati in its ranks cannot be affiliated to the Communist International. 
 “Why should we change the name of the party?” asks Comrade Lazzari. 
 “The present one is quite satisfactory. 
”But we cannot share this view. 
 We know the history ofthe Second International, its fall and bankruptcy. 
 Do we not know the history of the German party? And do we not know that the great misfortune of the working-class movementin Germany is that the break was not brought about beforethe war? This cost the lives of twenty thousand workers,whom the Scheidemannists and the Centrists betrayed tothe German Government by their polemics with and complaints against the German Communists. 
 130 And do we not now see the same thing in Italy? The Italian party was never a truly revolutionary party. 
 Itsgreat misfortune is that it did not break with the Menshe-viks and reformists before the war, and that the lattercontinued to remain in the party. 
 Comrade Lazzari says: “We fully recognise the necessity of a break with the reform-ists; our only disagreement is that we did not think itnecessary to bring it about at the Leghorn Congress. 
” But the facts tell a different story. 
 This is not the first time that we are discussing Italian reformism. 
 In arguing about this with Serrati last year, we said: “You won’t mind us asking why the split in the Italian party cannot be brought aboutimmediately, why it must be postponed?” What did Serratisay in reply to that? Nothing. 
 And Comrade Lazzari, quot-ing an article by Frossard in which the latter said, “Wemust be adroit and clever”, evidently thinks that this is an argument in his favour and against us. 
 I think he is mistak-en. 
 On the contrary, it is an excellent argument in ourfavour and against Comrade Lazzari. 
 What will the Italianworkers say when you are obliged to explain your conductand your resignation? What will you tell them if theydeclare our tactics to be clever and adroit compared with the zigzags of the pseudo-Communist Left—the Left which at times is not even simply Communist and more oftenlooks like anarchism? What is the meaning of the tales told by Serrati and his party about the Russians only wanting everyone toimitate them? We want the very opposite. 
 It takes more than memorising communist resolutions and using revolu-tionary phrases on every possible occasion. 
 That is notenough, and we are opposed beforehand to Communistswho know this or that resolution by heart. 
 The mark oftrue communism is a break with opportunism. 
 We shall bequite frank and open with those Communists who subscribe to this and, boldly, in the conviction that we are right, will tell them: “Don’t do anything stupid; be clever andskilful. 
” But we shall speak in this way only with Com-munists who have broken with the opportunists, somethingthat cannot yet be said about you. 
 I repeat therefore: Ihope the Congress will confirm the resolution of the Execu-tive Committee. 
 Comrade Lazzari said: “We are in the preparatory period. 
” This is absolutely true. 
 You are in thepreparatory period. 
 The first stage of this period is a breakwith the Mensheviks, similar to the one we brought aboutwith our Mensheviks in 1903. 
 The sufferings the whole ofthe German working class has had to endure during this long and weary post-war period in the history of the German revolution are due to the fact that the German party didnot break with the Mensheviks. 
 Comrade Lazzari said that the Italian party is passing through the preparatory period. 
 This I fully accept. 
 And the first stage is a definite, final, unambiguous and deter-mined break with reformism. 
 When that is brought aboutthe masses will side solidly with communism. 
 The secondstage is by no means a repetition of revolutionary slogans. 
It will be the adoption of our wise and skilful decisions,which will always be such, and which will always say: fundamental revolutionary principles must be adapted to the specific conditions in the various countries. 
 The revolution in Italy will run a different course from that in Russia. 
 It will start in a different way. 
 How?Neither you nor we know. 
 The Italian Communists are notalways Communists to a sufficient degree. 
 Did a single Communist show his mettle when the workers seized the factories in Italy? 131 No. 
 At that time, there was as yet no communism in Italy; there was a certain amount of anarch-ism, but no Marxian communism. 
 The latter has still-to be created and the masses of the workers must be imbued-with it by means of the experience of the revolutionary struggle. 
 And the first step along this road is a final break with the Mensheviks, who for more than twenty years havebeen collaborating and working with the bourgeois govern-ment. 
 It is quite Probable that Modigliani, whom I wasable to watch to some extent at the Zimmerwald and Kien-thal conferences, is a sufficiently astute politician to keep out of the bourgeois government and to keep in the centre of the Socialist Party, where he can be far more useful tothe bourgeoisie. 
 But all the theories of Turati and his friends,all their propaganda and agitation, signify collaborationwith the bourgeoisie. 
 Is this not proved by the numerousquotations in Gennari’s speech? Indeed, it is the united front which Turati has already prepared. 
 That is why I must say to Comrade Lazzari: “Speeches like yours and likethe one which Comrade Serrati made here do not help toprepare for the revolution, they disorganise it. 
” ( Shouts : “Bravo!” Applause . 
) You had a considerable majority at Leghorn. 
 You had 98,000 votes against 14,000 reformist and 58,000 communist votes. 
 As the beginning of a purely communist movement ina country like Italy, with its well-known traditions, where the ground has not been sufficiently prepared for a split, this vote is a considerable achievement for the Communists. 
 This is a great victory and tangible proof of the fact that the working-class movement in Italy will develop fasterthan our movement developed in Russia, because, if youare familiar with the figures concerning our movement,you must know that in February 1917, after the fall oftsarism and during the bourgeois republic, we were still a minority compared with the Mensheviks. 
 Such was the position after fifteen years of fierce fighting and splits. 
Our Right wing did not grow—and it was not so easy toprevent it from growing, as you seem to think when youspeak of Russia in such a disparaging tone. 
 Undoubtedly,development in Italy will proceed quite differently. 
 After fifteen years of struggle against the Mensheviks, and after the fall of tsarism, we started work with a much smallernumber of adherents. 
 You have 58,000 communisticallyminded workers against 98,000 united Centrists who occupyan indefinite position. 
 This is proof, this is a fact, whichshould certainly convince all those who refuse to close their eyes to the mass movement of the Italian workers. 
 Nothing comes all at once. 
 But it certainly proves that the massof workers—not the old leaders, the bureaucrats, the pro-fessors, the journalists, but the class that is actuallyexploited, the vanguard of the exploited—supports us. 
 Andit proves what a great mistake you made at Leghorn. 
 This is a fact. 
 You controlled 98,000 votes, but you preferred to go with 14,000 reformists against 58,000 Communists. 
You should have gone with them even if they were notgenuine Communists, even if they were only adherents ofBordiga—which is not true, for after the Second CongressBordiga quite honestly declared that he had abandoned all anarchism and anti-parliamentarism. 
 But what did you do? You chose to unite with 14,000 reformists and to breakwith 58,000 Communists. 
 And this is the best proof thatSerrati’s policy has been disastrous for Italy. 
 We neverwanted Serrati in Italy to copy the Russian revolution. 
That would have been stupid. 
 We are intelligent and flex-ible enough to avoid such stupidity. 
 But Serrati has proved that his policy in Italy was wrong. 
 Perhaps he shouldhave manoeuvred. 
 This is the expression that he repeated most often when he was here last year. 
 He said: “We know how to manoeuvre, we do not want slavish imitation. 
 That would be idiocy. 
 We must manoeuvre, so as to bring about a separation from opportunism. 
 You Russians do not knowhow to do that. 
 We Italians are more skilful at that sortof thing. 
 That remains to be seen. 
” And what is it we saw?Serrati executed a brilliant manoeuvre. 
 He broke away from58,000 Communists. 
 And now these comrades come here and say: “If you reject us the masses will be confused. 
” No, com-rades, you are mistaken. 
 The masses of the workers in Italyare confused now, and it will do them good if we tell them:“Comrades, you must choose; Italian workers, you mustchoose between the Communist International, which willnever call upon you slavishly to imitate the Russians, and the Mensheviks, whom we have known for twenty years, and whom we shall never tolerate as neighbours in agenuinely revolutionary Communist International. 
” That iswhat we shall say to the Italian workers. 
 There can be-no doubt about the result. 
 The masses of workers will followus. 
 ( Loud approval . 
) 3 SPEECH IN DEFENCE OF THE TACTICS OF THE COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL JULY 1 Comrades! I deeply regret that I must confine myself to self-defence. 
 ( Laughter . 
) I say deeply regret, because after acquainting myself with Comrade Terracini’s speech and the amendments introduced by three delegations, I shouldvery much like to take the offensive, for, properly speaking,offensive operations are essential against the views defendedby Terracini and these three delegations. 
 132 If the Congress is not going to wage a vigorous offensive against such errors, against such “Leftist” stupidities, the whole move-ment is doomed. 
 That is my deep conviction. 
 But we areorganised and disciplined Marxists. 
 We cannot be satisfiedwith speeches against individual comrades. 
 We Russiansare already sick and tired of these Leftist phrases. 
 We aremen of organisation. 
 In drawing up our plans, we must proceed in an organised way and try to find the correct line. 
 It is, of course, no secret that our theses are a compro-mise. 
 And why not? Among Communists, who have alreadyconvened their Third Congress and have worked out definitefundamental principles, compromises under certain condi-tions are necessary. 
 Our theses, put forward by the Russian delegation, were studied and prepared in the most careful way and were the result of long arguments and meetingswith various delegations. 
 They aim at establishing the basicline of the Communist International and are especiallynecessary now after we have not only formally condemnedthe real Centrists but have expelled them from the Party. 
 Such are the facts. 
 I have to stand up for these theses. 
 Now, when Terracini comes forward and says that we mustcontinue the fight against the Centrists, and goes on to tell how it is intended to wage the fight, I say that if these amendments denote a definite trend, a relentless fight against this trend is essential, for otherwise there is no communism and no Communist International. 
 I amsurprised that the German Communist Workers’ Partyhas not put its signature to these amendments. 
 ( Laughter . 
) Indeed, just listen to what Terracini is defending andwhat his amendments say. 
 They begin in this way: “On page 1, column 1, line 19, the word ‘majority’ should be deleted. 
” Majority! That is extremely dangerous! ( Laughter . 
) Then further: instead of the words “’basic propositions’,insert ‘aims’”. 
 Basic propositions and aims are two diffe-rent things; even the anarchists will agree with us aboutaims, because they too stand for the abolition of exploita-tion and class distinctions. 
 I have met and talked with few anarchists in my life, but all the same I have seen enough of them. 
 I sometimessucceeded in reaching agreement with them about aims,but never as regards principles. 
 Principles are not an aim,a programme, a tactic or a theory. 
 Tactics and theory are not principles. 
 How do we differ from the anarchists on principles? The principles of communism consist in theestablishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat and inthe use of state coercion in the transition period. 
 Such arethe principles of communism, but they are not its aim. 
 Andthe comrades who have tabled this proposal have made a mistake. 
 Secondly, it is stated there: “the word ‘majority’ should be deleted. 
” Read the whole passage: “The Third Congress of the Communist International is setting out to review questions of tactics under conditions when in a whole number of countries the objective situation has become aggravatedin a revolutionary sense, and when a whole number of communistmass parties have been organised, which, incidentally, in their actualrevolutionary struggle have nowhere taken into their hands the virtualleadership of the majority of the working class. 
” And so, they want the word “majority” deleted. 
 If we cannot agree on such simple things, then I do not under-stand how we can work together and lead the proletariat to victory. 
 Then it is not at all surprising that we cannoteach agreement on the question of principles either. 
 Show me a party which has already won the majority of the working class. 
 Terracini did not even think of adducing any example. 
 Indeed, there is no such example. 
 And so, the word “aims” is to be put instead of “princi-ples”, and the word “majority” is to be deleted. 
 No, thankyou! We shall not do it. 
 Even the German party—one ofthe best—does not have the majority of the working classbehind it. 
 That is a fact. 
 We, who face a most severe strug-gle, are not afraid to utter this truth, but here you have three delegations who wish to begin with an untruth, forif the Congress deletes the word “majority” it will showthat it wants an untruth. 
 That is quite clear. 
 Then comes the following amendment: “On page 4, column 1, line 10, the words ‘Open Letter’, etc. 
, should be deleted. 
” 133 I have already heard one speech today in which I found the same idea. 
 But there it was quite natural. 
It was the speech of Comrade Hempel, a member of theGerman Communist Workers’ Party. 
 He said: “The ‘OpenLetter’ was an act of opportunism. 
” To my deep regretand shame, I have already heard such views privately. 
 But when, at the Congress, after such prolonged debate, the “Open Letter” is declared opportunist—that is a shameand a disgrace! And now Comrade Terracini comes forwardon behalf of the three delegations and wants to delete thewords “Open Letter”. 
 What is the good then of the fightagainst the German Communist Workers’ Party? The “Open Letter” is a model political step. 
 This is stated in our theses and we must certainly stand by it. 
 It is a modelbecause it is the first act of a practical method of winningover the majority of the working class. 
 In Europe, wherealmost all the proletarians are organised, we must win themajority of the working class and anyone who fails to under-stand this is lost to the communist movement; he will never learn anything if he has failed to learn that much duringthe three years of the great revolution. 
 Terracini says that we were victorious in Russia although the Party was very small. 
 He is dissatisfied with what issaid in the theses about Czechoslovakia. 
 Here there are 27 amendments, and if I had a mind to criticise them I should, like some orators, have to speak for not less thanthree hours .... 
 We have heard here that in Czechoslo-vakia the Communist Party has 300,000-400,000 members, and that it is essential to win over the majority, to create an invincible force and continue enlisting fresh masses of workers. 
 Terracini is already prepared to attack. 
 He says:if there are already 400,000 workers in the party, whyshould we want more? Delete! ( Laughter . 
) He is afraid of the word “masses” and wants to eradicate it. 
 Comrade Ter-racini has understood very little of the Russian revolution. 
 In Russia, we were a small party, but we had with us in addition the majority of the Soviets of Workers’ andPeasants’ Deputies throughout the country. 
 ( Cries : “Quite true!”) Do you have anything of the sort? We had with usalmost half the army, which then numbered at least tenmillion men. 
 Do you really have the majority of the army behind you? Show me such a country! If these views of Comrade Terracini are shared by three other delegations,then something is wrong in the International! Then wemust say: “Stop! There must be a decisive fight! Otherwisethe Communist International is lost. 
” ( Animation . 
) On the basis of my experience I must say, although I am taking up a defensive position ( laughter ), that the aim and the principle of my speech consist in defence of theresolution and theses proposed by our delegation. 
 It would,of course, be pedantic to say that not a letter in them mustbe altered. 
 I have had to read many resolutions and I amwell aware that very good amendments could he introduced in every line of them. 
 But that would be pedantry. 
 If, never-theless, I declare now that in a political sense not asingle letter can be altered, it is because the amendments,as I see them, are of a quite definite political nature andbecause they lead us along a path that is harmful and dan-gerous to the Communist International. 
 Therefore, I and all of us and the Russian delegation must insist that not a single letter in the theses is altered. 
 We have not onlycondemned our Right-wing elements—we have expelledthem. 
 But if, like Terracini, people turn the fight againstthe Rightists into a sport, then we must say: “Stop! Other-wise the danger will become too grave!” Terracini has defended the theory of an offensive strug-gle. 
 134 In this connection the notorious amendments propose a formula two or three pages long. 
 There is no need for us to read them. 
 We know what they say. 
 Terracini has stated the issue quite clearly. 
 He has defended the theory of an offensive, pointing out “dynamic tendencies” and the “transition from passivity to activity”. 
 We in Russia havealready had adequate political experience in the struggleagainst the Centrists. 
 As long as fifteen years ago, we werewaging a struggle against our opportunists and Centrists,and also against the Mensheviks, and we were victorious not only over the Mensheviks, but also over the semi-anarchists. 
 If we had not done this, we would not have been able to retain power in our hands for three and a half years,or even for three and a half weeks, and we would not havebeen able to convene communist congresses here. 
 “Dynamic tendencies”, “transition from passivity to activity”—these are all phrases the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries had usedagainst us. 
 Now they are in prison, defending there the“aims of communism” and thinking of the “transition frompassivity to activity”. 
 ( Laughter . 
) The line of reasoning followed in the proposed amendments is an impossible one, because they contain no Marxism, no political experience, and no reasoning. 
 Have we in our theses elaborated a generaltheory of the revolutionary offensive? Has Radek or anyoneof us committed such a stupidity? We have spoken of thetheory of an offensive in relation to a quite definite countryand at a quite definite period. 
 From our struggle against the Mensheviks we can quote instances showing that even before the first revolutionthere were some who doubted whether the revolutionaryparty aught to conduct an offensive. 
 If such doubts assailedany Social-Democrat—as we all called ourselves at thattime—we took up the struggle against him and said that he was an opportunist, that he did not understand anything of Marxism and the dialectics of the revolutionary party. 
Is it really possible for a party to dispute whether a revo-lutionary offensive is permissible in general? To find suchexamples in this country one would have to go back somefifteen years. 
 If there are Centrists or disguised Centrists who dispute the theory of the offensive, they should be immediately expelled. 
 That question cannot give rise todisputes. 
 But the fact that-even now, after three years of the Communist International, we are arguing about “dynamic tendencies”, about the “transition from passivity to activity” —that is a shame and a disgrace. 
 We do not have any dispute about this with Comrade Radek, who drafted these theses jointly with us. 
 Perhapsit was not quite correct to begin talking in Germany about the theory of the revolutionary offensive when an actual offensive had not been prepared. 
 Nevertheless the March action was a great step forward in spite of the mistakes of its leaders. 
 But this does not matter. 
 Hundreds of thou-sands of workers fought heroically. 
 However courageouslythe German Communist Workers’ Party fought against thebourgeoisie, we must repeat what Comrade Radek said ina Russian article about Hölz. 
 If anyone, even an anarchist, fights heroically against the bourgeoisie, that is, of course, a great thing; but it is a real step forward if hundreds ofthousands fight against the vile provocation of the social-traitors and against the bourgeoisie. 
 It is very important to be critical of one’s mistakes. 
 We began with that. 
 If anyone, after a struggle in which hun-dreds of thousands have taken part, comes out against this struggle and behaves like Levi, then he should beexpelled. 
 And that is what was done. 
 But we must draw alesson from this. 
 Had we really prepared for an offensive?(Radek : “We had not even prepared for defence. 
”) Indeed only newspaper articles talked of an offensive. 
 This theory as applied to the March action in Germany in 1921 was incorrect—we have to admit that—but, in general, thetheory of the revolutionary offensive is not at all false. 
 We were victorious in Russia, and with such ease, because we prepared for our revolution during the impe-rialist war. 
 That was the first condition. 
 Ten million workers and peasants in Russia were armed, and our slogan was: an immediate peace at all costs. 
 We were victorious becausethe vast mass of the peasants were revolutionarily disposedagainst the big landowners. 
 The Socialist-Revolutionaries,the adherents of the Second and the Two-and-a-Half Inter-nationals, were a big peasant party in November 1917. 
 They demanded revolutionary methods but, like true heroes of the Second and the Two-and-a-Half Internationals,lacked the courage to act in a revolutionary way. 
 In August and September 1917 we said: “Theoretically we are fighting the Socialist-Revolutionaries as we did before, but practi-cally we are ready to accept their programme because only we are able to put it into effect. 
” We did just what we said. 
The peasantry, ill-disposed towards us in November 1917,after our victory, who sent a majority of Socialist-Revolu-tionaries into the Constituent Assembly, were won overby us, if not in the course of a few days—as I mistakenly expected and predicted—at any rate in the course of a few weeks. 
 The difference was not great. 
 Can you point out anycountry in Europe where you could win over the majorityof the peasantry in the course of a few weeks? Italy perhaps?(Laughter . 
) If it is said that we were victorious in Russia in spite of not having a big party, that only proves that those who say it have not understood the Russian revolution and that they have absolutely no understanding of how toprepare for a revolution. 
 Our first step was to create a real Communist Party so as to know whom we were talking to and whom we couldfully trust. 
 The slogan of the First and Second congresses was “Down with the Centrists!” We cannot hope to master even the ABC of communism, unless all along the line andthroughout the world we make short shrift of the Centristsand semi-Centrists, whom in Russia we call Mensheviks. 
Our first task is to create a genuinely revolutionary partyand to break with the Mensheviks. 
 But that is only a preparatory school. 
 We are already convening the Third Congress, and Comrade Terracini keeps saying that the taskof the preparatory school consists in hunting out, pursuingand exposing Centrists and semi-Centrists. 
 No, thankyou! We have already done this long enough. 
 At the SecondCongress we said that the Centrists are our enemies. 
 But, we must go forward really. 
 The second stage, after organ-ising into a party, consists in learning to prepare forrevolution. 
 In many countries we have not even learnedhow to assume the leadership. 
 We were victorious in Russianot only because the undisputed majority of the workingclass was on our side (during the elections in 1917 the over-whelming majority of the workers were with us against the Mensheviks), but also because half the army, immediatelyafter our seizure of power, and nine-tenths of the peasants, in the course of some weeks, came over to our side; we were victorious because we adopted the agrarian programme of the Socialist-Revolutionaries instead of our own, and put it into effect. 
 Our victory lay in the fact that we carried outthe Socialist-Revolutionary programme; that is why thisvictory was so easy. 
 Is it possible that you in the Westcan have such illusions? It is ridiculous! Just comparethe concrete economic conditions, Comrade Terracini and all of you who have signed the proposed amendments! In spite of the fact that the majority so rapidly came tobe on our side, the difficulties confronting us after ourvictory were very great. 
 Nevertheless we won throughbecause we kept in mind not only our aims but also ourprinciples, and did not tolerate in our Party those who kept silent about principles but talked of aims, “dynamic tendencies” and the “transition from passivity to activity”. 
Perhaps we shall be blamed for preferring to keep suchgentlemen in prison. 
 But dictatorship is impossible in anyother way. 
 We must prepare for dictatorship, and thisconsists in combating such phrases and such amendments. 
 (Laughter . 
) Throughout, our theses speak of the masses. 
 But, comrades, we need to understand what is meant bymasses. 
 The German Communist Workers’ Party, the Left-wing comrades, misuse this word. 
 But Comrade Terracini,too, and all those who have signed these amendments, donot know how the word “masses” should be read. 
 I have been speaking too long as it is; hence I wish to say only a few words about the concept of “masses”. 
 It isone that changes in accordance with the changes in thenature of the struggle. 
 At the beginning of the struggle ittook only a few thousand genuinely revolutionary workersto warrant talk of the masses. 
 If the party succeeds in drawing into the struggle not only its own members, if it also succeeds in arousing non-party people, it is well on theway to winning the masses. 
 During our revolutions there wereinstances when several thousand workers represented themasses. 
 In the history of our movement, and of our struggleagainst the Mensheviks, you will find many examples where several thousand workers in a town were enough to give a clearly mass character to the movement. 
 You havea mass when several thousand non-party workers, who usually live a philistine life and drag out a miserable existence, and who have never heard anything about po-litics, begin to act in a revolutionary way. 
 If the movement spreads and intensifies, it gradually develops into a realrevolution. 
 We saw this in 1905 and 1917 during three rev-olutions, and you too will have to go through all this. 
 Whenthe revolution has been sufficiently prepared, the concept“masses” becomes different: several thousand workers no longer constitute the masses. 
 This word begins to denote something else. 
 The concept of “masses” undergoes a changeso that it implies the majority, and not simply a majorityof the workers alone, but the majority of all the exploited. 
Any other kind of interpretation is impermissible for arevolutionary, and any other sense of the word becomes incomprehensible. 
 It is possible that even a small party, the British or American party, for example, after it hasthoroughly studied the course of political development andbecome acquainted with the life and customs of the non-party masses, will at a favourable moment evoke a revolu-tionary movement (Comrade Radek has pointed to the miners’ strike as a good example 135). 
 You will have a mass movement if such a party comes forward with its slogansat such a moment and succeeds in getting millions of workersto follow it. 
 I would not altogether deny that a revolutioncan be started by a very small party and brought to a victo-rious conclusion. 
 But one must have a knowledge of the methods by which the masses can be won over. 
 For this thoroughgoing preparation of revolution is essential. 
 Buthere you have comrades coming forward with the assertionthat we should immediately give up the demand for “big”masses. 
 They must be challenged. 
 Without thoroughgoingpreparation you will not achieve victory in any country. 
 Quite a small party is sufficient to lead the masses. 
 At certain times there is no necessity for big organisations. 
 But to win, we must have the sympathy of the masses. 
 An absolute majority is not always essential; but whatis essential to win and retain power is not only the majorityof the working class—I use the term “working class” in its West-European sense, i. 
e. 
, in the sense of the industrial proletariat—but also the majority of the working andexploited rural population. 
 Have you thought about this? /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR Do we find in Terracini’s speech even a hint at this thought? He speaks only of “dynamic tendency” and the “transition from passivity to activity”. 
 Does he devote even a single word to the food question? And yet the workers demand theirvictuals, although they can put up with a great deal andgo hungry, as we have seen to a certain extent in Russia. 
We must, therefore, win over to our side not only themajority of the working class, but also the majority of the working and exploited rural population. 
 Have you prepared for this? Almost nowhere. 
 And so, I repeat: I must unreservedly defend our theses and I feel I am bound to do it. 
 We not only condemnedthe Centrists but expelled them from the Party. 
 Now wemust deal with another aspect, which we also consider dangerous. 
 We must tell the comrades the truth in the most polite form (and in our theses it is told in a kind and con-siderate way) so that no one feels insulted: we are confrontednow by other, more important questions than that of attackson the Centrists. 
 We have had enough of this question. 
 Ithas already become somewhat boring. 
 Instead, the com-rades ought to learn to wage a real revolutionary struggle. 
 The German workers have already begun this. 
 Hundredsof thousands of proletarians in that country have been fight-ing heroically. 
 Anyone who opposes this struggle shouldbe immediately expelled. 
 But after that we must not engagein empty word-spinning but must immediately begin to learn, on the basis of the mistakes made, how to organise the struggle better. 
 We must not conceal our mistakesfrom the enemy. 
 Anyone who is afraid of this is no revolu-tionary. 
 On the contrary, if we openly declare to the work-ers: “Yes, we have made mistakes”, it will mean that theywill not be repeated and we shall be able better to choose the moment. 
 And if during the struggle itself the majority of the working people prove to be on our side—not onlythe majority of the workers, but the majority of all theexploited and oppressed—then we shall really be victorious. 
(Prolonged , stormy applause . 
) 4 REPORT ON THE TACTICS OF THE R. 
C. 
P. 
 JULY 5 Comrades, strictly speaking I was unable to prepare properly for this report. 
 All that I was able to prepare foryou in the way of systematic material was a translation of my pamphlet on the tax in kind and the theses on the tactics of the Russian Communist Party. 
 To this I merelywant to add a few explanations and remarks. 
 I think that to explain our Party’s tactics we must first of all examine the international situation . 
 We have already had a detailed discussion of the economic position of capital-ism internationally, and the Congress has adopted definite resolutions on this subject. 
 136 I deal with this subject in my theses very briefly, and only from the political stand-point. 
 I leave aside the economic basis, but I think that indiscussing the international position of our Republic wemust, politically, take into account the fact that a certain equilibrium has now undoubtedly set in between the forces that have been waging an open, armed struggle againsteach other for the supremacy of this or that leading class. 
It is an equilibrium between bourgeois society, the inter-national bourgeoisie as a whole, and Soviet Russia. 
 It is, ofcourse, an equilibrium only in a limited sense. 
 It is only in respect to this military struggle, I say, that a certain equilibrium has been brought about in the internationalsituation. 
 It must be emphasised, of course, that this isonly a relative equilibrium, and a very unstable one. 
 Muchinflammable material has accumulated in capitalist coun-tries, as well as in those countries which up to now have been regarded merely as the objects and not as the subjects of history, i. 
e. 
, the colonies and semi-colonies. 
 It is quitepossible, therefore, that insurrections, great battles and revolutions may break out there sooner or later, and very suddenly too. 
 During the past few years we have witnessed the direct struggle waged by the international bourgeoisie against the first proletarian republic. 
 This struggle hasbeen at the centre of the world political situation, and itis there that a change has taken place. 
 Inasmuch as theattempt of the international bourgeoisie to strangle ourRepublic has failed, an equilibrium has set in, and a very unstable one it is, of course. 
 We know perfectly well, of course, that the international bourgeoisie is at present much stronger than our Republic,and that it is only the peculiar combination of circumstancesthat is preventing it from continuing the war against us. 
For several weeks now, we have witnessed fresh attempts in the Far East to renew the invasion, 137 and there is not the slightest doubt that similar attempts will continue. 
Our Party has no doubts whatever on that score. 
 Theimportant thing for us is to establish that an unstableequilibrium does exist, and that we must take advantageof this respite, taking into consideration the characteristic features of the present situation, adapting our tactics to the specific features of this situation, and never forgettingthat the necessity for armed struggle may arise again quitesuddenly. 
 Our task is still to organise and build up the RedArmy. 
 In connection with the food problem, too, we mustcontinue to think first of all of our Red Army. 
 We can adopt no other line in the present international situation, when we must still be prepared for fresh attacks and fresh attemptsat invasion on the part of the international bourgeoisie. 
In regard to our practical policy, however, the fact that acertain equilibrium has been reached in the internationalsituation has some significance, but only in the sense that we must admit that, although the revolutionary movement has made-progress, the development of the internationalrevolution this year has not proceeded along as straighta line as we had expected. 
 When we started the international revolution, we did so not because we were convinced that we could forestall its development, but because a number of circumstances compelled us to start it. 
 We thought: either the internationalrevolution comes to our assistance, and in that case our victory will be fully assured, or we shall do our modest revolutionary work in the conviction that even in the event of defeat we shall have served the cause of the revolu-tion and that our experience will benefit other revolutions. 
It was clear to us that without the support of the interna-tional world revolution the victory of the proletarianrevolution was impossible. 
 Before the revolution, and evenafter it, we thought: either revolution breaks out in the other countries, in the capitalistically more developed countries, immediately, or at least very quickly, or we mustperish. 
 In spite of this conviction, we did all we possiblycould to preserve the Soviet system under all circumstances,come what may, because we knew that we were not onlyworking for ourselves, but also for the international revo-lution. 
 We knew this, we repeatedly expressed this con-viction before the October Revolution, immediately afterit, and at the time we signed the Brest-Litovsk Peace Treaty. 
And, generally speaking, this was correct. 
 Actually, however, events did not proceed along as straight a line as we had expected. 
 In the other big, capi-talistically more developed countries the revolution has not broken out to this day. 
 True, we can say with satisfac-tion that the revolution is developing all over the world;and it is only thanks to this that the internationalbourgeoisie is unable to strangle us, in spite of the factthat, militarily and economically, it is a hundred times stronger than we are. 
 ( Applause . 
) In Paragraph 2 of the theses I examine the manner in which this situation arose, and the conclusions that mustbe drawn from it. 
 Let me add that my final conclusion isthe following: the development of the international revolu-tion, which we predicted, is proceeding, but not along as straight a line as we had expected. 
 It becomes clear at the first glance that after the conclusion of peace, bad as it was,it proved impossible to call forth revolution in other capi-talist countries, although we know that the signs of revo-lution were very considerable and numerous, in fact, muchmore considerable and numerous than we thought at the time. 
 Pamphlets are now beginning to appear which tell us that during the past few years and months these revolu-tionary symptoms in Europe have been much more serious than we had suspected. 
 What, in that case, must we do now? We must now thoroughly prepare for revolution and make a deep study of its concrete development in the advanced capitalist countries. 
 This is the first lesson we must drawfrom the international situation. 
 As for our Russian Repub-lic, we must take advantage of this brief respite in orderto adapt our tactics to this zigzag line of history. 
 Thisequilibrium is very important politically, because we clearly see that in many West-European countries, where the broad mass of the working class, and possibly the over-whelming majority of the population, are organised, themain bulwark of the bourgeoisie consists of the hostileworking-class organisations affiliated to the Second and theTwo-and-a-Half Internationals. 
 I speak of this in Para-graph 2 of the theses, and I think that in this connection I need deal with only two points, which were discussedduring the debate on the question of tactics. 
 First, winningover the majority of the proletariat. 
 The more organisedthe proletariat is in a capitalistically developed country,the greater thoroughness does history demand of us in preparing for revolution, and the more thoroughly must we win over the majority of the working class. 
 Second,the main bulwark of capitalism in the industrially developedcapitalist countries is the part of the working class thatis organised in the Second and the Two-and-a-HalfInternationals. 
 But for the support of this section of the workers, these counter-revolutionary elements within the working class, the international bourgeoisie would be alto-gether unable to retain its position. 
 ( Applause . 
) Here I would also like to emphasise the significance of the movement in the colonies . 
 In this respect we see in all the old parties, in all the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois labour parties affiliated to the Second and the Two-and-a-Half Internationals, survivals of the old sentimental views:they insist on their profound sympathy for oppressedcolonial and semi-colonial peoples. 
 The movement in thecolonial countries is still regarded as an insignificant nationaland totally peaceful movement. 
 But this is not so. 
 It has undergone great change since the beginning of the twentieth century: millions and hundreds of millions, in fact theoverwhelming majority of the population of the globe, are now coming forward as independent, active and revolu-tionary factors. 
 It is perfectly clear that in the impending decisive battles in the world revolution, the movement of the majority of the population of the globe, initially direct-ed towards national liberation, will turn against capitalismand imperialism and will, perhaps, play a much morerevolutionary part than we expect. 
 It is important to empha-sise the fact that, for the first time in our International, we have taken up the question of preparing for this struggle. 
 Of course, there are many more difficulties in this enormoussphere than in any other, but at all events the movementis advancing. 
 And in spite of the fact that the massesof toilers—the peasants in the colonial countries—are stillbackward, they will play a very important revolutionary part in the coming phases of the world revolution. 
 (Animated approval . 
) As regards the internal political position of our Republic I must start with a close examination of class relationships. 
During the past few months changes have taken place inthis sphere, and we have witnessed the formation of new organisations of the exploiting class directed against us. 
 The aim of socialism is to abolish classes. 
 In the front ranksof the exploiting class we find the big landowners and theindustrial capitalists. 
 In regard to them, the work ofdestruction is fairly easy; it can be completed within a fewmonths, and sometimes even a few weeks or days. 
 We in Russia have expropriated our exploiters, the big landowners as well as the capitalists. 
 They had no organisations of theirown during the war and operated merely as the appendagesof the military forces of the international bourgeoisie. 
Now, after we have repulsed the attacks of the internationalcounter-revolution, organisations of the Russian bourgeoisie and of all the Russian counter-revolutionary parties have been formed abroad. 
 The number of Russian émigrés scatteredin all foreign countries may be estimated at one and ahalf to two millions. 
 In nearly every country they publishdaily newspapers, and all the parties, landowner and petty-bourgeois, not excluding the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, have numerous ties with foreign bourgeois elements, that is to say, they obtain enough money to runtheir own press. 
 We find the collaboration abroad of absolutely all the political parties that formerly existed in Russia, and we see how the “free” Russian press abroad, from the Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik press to the most reactionary monarchist press, is championing thegreat landed interests. 
 This, to a certain extent, facilitatesour task, because we can more easily observe the forces ofthe enemy, his state of organisation, and the politicaltrends in his camp. 
 On the other hand, of course, it hinders our work, because these Russian counter-revolutionary émigrés use every means at their disposal to prepare fora fight against us. 
 This fight again shows that, taken asa whole, the class instinct and class-consciousness of theruling classes are still superior to those of the oppressedclasses, notwithstanding the fact that the Russian revolution has done more than any previous revolution in this respect. 
 In Russia, there is hardly a village in which the people,the oppressed, have not been roused. 
 Nevertheless, if wetake a cool look at the state of organisation and politicalclarity of views of the Russian counter-revolutionary émigrés,we shall find that the class-consciousness of the bourgeoisie is still superior to that of the exploited and the oppressed. 
 These people make every possible attempt and skilfullytake advantage of every opportunity to attack SovietRussia in one way or another, and to dismember it. 
 It wouldbe very instructive—and I think the foreign comrades willdo that—systematically to watch the most important aspirations, the most important tactical moves, and the most important trends of this Russian counter-revolution. 
It operates chiefly abroad, and it will not be very difficultfor the foreign comrades to watch it. 
 In some respects,we ought to learn from this enemy. 
 These counter-revolu-tionary émigrés are very well informed, they are excellently organised and are good strategists. 
 And I think that a syste-matic comparison and study of the manner in which theyare organised and take advantage of every opportunitymay have a powerful propaganda effect upon the workingclass. 
 This is not general theory, it is practical politics;here we can see what the enemy has learned. 
 During the past few years, the Russian bourgeoisie has suffered a terrible defeat. 
 There is an old saying that a beaten army learnsa great deal. 
 The beaten reactionary army has learned a great deal, and has learned it thoroughly. 
 It is learning with great avidity, and has really made much headway. 
 When we took power at one swoop, the Russian bourgeoisie was unorganised and politically undeveloped. 
 Now, I think,its development is on a par with modern, West-Europeandevelopment. 
 We must take this into account, we mustimprove our own organisation and methods, and we shalldo our utmost to achieve this. 
 It was relatively easy for us, and I think that it will be equally easy for other revolutions, to cope with these two exploiting classes. 
 But, in addition to this class of exploiters, there is in nearly all capitalist countries, with the exception, perhaps,of Britain, a class of small producers and small farmers. 
The main problem of the revolution now is how to fight these two classes. 
 In order to be rid of them, we must adopt methods other than those employed against the biglandowners and capitalists. 
 We could simply expropriateand expel both of these classes, and that is what we did. 
But we cannot do the same thing with the remainingcapitalist classes, the small producers and the petty bourgeoisie, which are found in all countries. 
 In most capi-talist countries, these classes constitute a very considerableminority, approximately from thirty to forty-five per centof the population. 
 Add to them the petty-bourgeoiselements of the working class, and you get even more thanfifty per cent. 
 These cannot be expropriated or expelled; other methods of struggle must be adopted in their case. 
 From the international standpoint, if we regard the inter-national revolution as one process, the significance of theperiod into which we are now entering in Russia is, inessence, that we must now find a practical solution for theproblem of the relations the proletariat should establish with this last capitalist class in Russia. 
 All Marxists have a correct and ready solution for this problem in theory. 
But theory and practice are two different things, and thepractical solution of this problem is by no means the sameas the theoretical solution. 
 We know definitely that wehave made serious mistakes. 
 From the international stand-point, it is a sign of great progress that we are now trying to determine the attitude the proletariat in power shouldadopt towards the last capitalist class—the rock-bottom of capitalism—small private property, the small producer. 
 This problem now confronts us in a practical way. 
 I think we shall solve it. 
 At all events, the experiment we are making will be useful for future proletarian revolutions,and they will be able to make better technical preparationsfor solving it. 
 In my theses I tried to analyse the problem of the relations between the proletariat and the peasantry . 
 For the first time in history there is a state with only two classes, the proletariat and the peasantry. 
 The latter constitutes the over-whelming majority of the population. 
 It is, of course, verybackward. 
 How do the relations between the peasantry andthe proletariat, which holds political power, find practicalexpression in the development of the revolution? The first form is alliance, close alliance. 
 This is a very difficult task, but at any rate it is economically and politically feasible. 
 How did we approach this problem practically? We concluded an alliance with the peasantry. 
 We interpretthis alliance in the following way: the proletariat eman-cipates the peasantry from the exploitation of the bourgeoi-sie, from its leadership and influence, and wins it over to its own side in order jointly to defeat the exploiters. 
 The Menshevik argument runs like this: the peasantry constitutes a majority; we are pure democrats, therefore,the majority should decide. 
 But as the peasantry cannotoperate on its own, this, in practice, means nothing more nor less than the restoration of capitalism. 
 The slogan is the same: Alliance with the peasantry. 
 When we say that,we mean strengthening and consolidating the proletariat. 
We have tried to give effect to this alliance between theproletariat and the peasantry, and the first stage was amilitary alliance. 
 The three years of the Civil War created enormous difficulties, but in certain respects they facilitated our task. 
 This may-sound odd, but it is true. 
 The war was notsomething new for the peasants; a war against the exploit-ers, against the big landowners, was something they quiteunderstood. 
 The overwhelming majority of the peasantswere on our side. 
 In spite of the enormous distances, and the fact that the overwhelming majority of our peasants are unable to read or write, they assimilated our propagandavery easily. 
 This proves that the broad masses—and this applies also to the most advanced countries—learn faster from their own practical experience than from books. 
 In Russia, moreover, learning from practical experiencewas facilitated for the peasantry by the fact that the country is so exceptionally large that in the same period different parts of it were passing through different stages of develop-ment. 
 In Siberia and in the Ukraine the counter-revolution was able to gain a temporary victory because there thebourgeoisie had the peasantry on its side, because the peasants were against us. 
 The peasants frequently said, “We are Bolsheviks, but not Communists. 
 We are for theBolsheviks because they drove out the landowners; but we are not for the Communists because they are opposed to individual farming. 
” And for a time, the counter-revo-lution managed to win out in Siberia and in the Ukraine because the bourgeoisie made headway in the struggle for influence over the peasantry. 
 But it took only a very shorttime to open the peasants’ eyes. 
 They quickly acquired practical experience and soon said, “Yes, the Bolsheviks are rather unpleasant people, we don’t like them, butstill they are better than the whiteguards and the Con-stituent Assembly. 
” “Constituent Assembly” is a term of abuse not only among the educated Communists, butalso among the peasants. 
 They know from practical ex-perience that the Constituent Assembly and the white-guards stand for the same thing, that the former is inevi-tably followed by the latter. 
 The Mensheviks also resort to a military alliance with the peasantry, but they fail to understand that a military alliance alone is inadequate. 
There can be no military alliance without an economic alliance. 
 It takes more than air to keep a man alive; our alliance with the peasantry could not possibly have lastedany length of time without the economic foundation, which was the basis of our victory in the war against our bourgeoi-sie. 
 After all our bourgeoisie has united with the wholeof the international bourgeoisie. 
 The basis of our economic alliance with the peasantry was, of course, very simple, and even crude. 
 The peasantobtained from us all the land and support against the big landowners. 
 In return for this, we were to obtain food. 
 This alliance was something entirely new and did not rest on the ordinary relations between commodity producers and consumers. 
 Our peasants had a much better understand-ing of this than the heroes of the Second and the Two-and-a-Half Internationals. 
 They said to themselves, “TheseBolsheviks are stern leaders, but after all they are our ownpeople. 
” Be that as it may, we created in this way the foun-dations of a new economic alliance. 
 The peasants gave their produce to the Red Army and received from the latterassistance in protecting their possessions. 
 This is always for-gotten by the heroes of the Second International, who, likeOtto Bauer, totally fail to understand the actual situation. 
We confess that the initial form of this alliance was very primitive and that we made very many mistakes. 
 But we were obliged to act as quickly as possible, we had to organisesupplies for the army at all costs. 
 During the Civil War wewere cut off from all the grain districts of Russia. 
 We werein a terrible position, and it looks like a miracle that theRussian people and the working class were able to endure such suffering, want, and privation, sustained by nothing more than a deep urge for victory. 
 ( Animated approval and applause . 
) When the Civil War came to an end, however, we faced a different problem. 
 If the country had not been so laidwaste after seven years of incessant war, it would, perhaps, have been possible to find an easier transition to the new form of alliance between the proletariat and the peasantry. 
But bad as conditions in the country were, they were stillfurther aggravated by the crop failure, the fodder shortage,etc. 
 In consequence, the sufferings of the peasants becameunbearable. 
 We had to show the broad masses of the peasants immediately that we were prepared to change our policy, without in any way deviating from our revolutionary path,so that they could say, “The Bolsheviks want to improveour intolerable condition immediately, and at all costs. 
” And so, our economic policy was changed ; the tax in kind superseded the requisitions. 
 This was not invented at one stroke. 
 You will find a number of proposals in the Bolshevik press over a period of months, but no plan that reallypromised success. 
 But this is not important. 
 The important thing is that we changed our economic policy, yielding to exclusively practical considerations, and impelled by necessity. 
 A bad harvest, fodder shortage and lack of fuel—all, of course, have a decisive influence on the economy as awhole, including the peasant economy. 
 If the peasantrygoes on strike, we get no firewood; and if we get no firewood,the factories will have to idle. 
 Thus, in the spring of 1921,the economic crisis resulting from the terrible crop failure and the fodder shortage assumed gigantic proportions. 
 All that was the aftermath of the three years of civil war. 
We had to show the peasantry that we could and wouldquickly change our policy in order immediately to alleviatetheir distress. 
 We have always said—and it was also saidat the Second Congress—that revolution demands sacri-fices. 
 Some comrades in their propaganda argue in the follow-ing way: we are prepared to stage a revolution, but it mustnot be too severe. 
 Unless I am mistaken, this thesis wasput forward by Comrade Smeral in his speech at the Congressof the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. 
 I read about itin the report published in the Reichenberg Vorwärts 138 There is evidently a Leftist wing there; hence this source cannot be regarded as being quite impartial. 
 At all events,I must say that if Smeral did say that, he was wrong. 
 Somecomrades who spoke after Smeral at this Congress said,“Yes, we shall go along with Smeral because in this waywe shall avoid civil war. 
” ( Laughter . 
) If these reports are true, I must say that such agitation is neither communistic nor revolutionary. 
 Naturally, every revolution entails enor-mous sacrifice on the part of the class making it. 
 Revolutiondiffers from ordinary struggle in that ten and even a hundredtimes more people take part in it. 
 Hence every revolutionentails sacrifices not only for individuals, but for a whole class. 
 The dictatorship of the proletariat in Russia has entailed for the ruling class—the proletariat—sacrifices,want and privation unprecedented in history, and the casewill, in all probability, be the same in every other country. 
 The question arises: How are we to distribute this burden of privation? We are the state power. 
 We are able to distribute the burden of privation to a certain extent, and to impose it upon several classes, thereby relatively allevi-ating the condition of certain strata of the population. 
 But what is to be our principle? Is it to be that of fairness, or of majority? No. 
 We must act in a practical manner. 
 We must distribute the burdens in such a way as to preserve the power of the proletariat. 
 This is our only principle. 
In the beginning of the revolution the working class wascompelled to suffer incredible want. 
 Let me state thatfrom year to year our food policy has been achieving increasingsuccess. 
 And the situation as a whole has undoubtedly im-proved. 
 But the peasantry in Russia has certainly gained more from the revolution than the working class. 
 There is no doubtabout that at all. 
 From the standpoint of theory, thisshows, of course, that our revolution was to some degreea bourgeois revolution. 
 When Kautsky used this as anargument against us, we laughed. 
 Naturally, a revolution which does not expropriate the big landed estates, expel the big landowners or divide the land is only a bourgeoisrevolution and not a socialist one. 
 But we were the onlyparty to carry the bourgeois revolution to its conclusionand to facilitate the struggle for the socialist revolution. 
The Soviet power and the Soviet system are institutions of the socialist state. 
 We have already established these institutions, but we have not yet solved the problem ofeconomic relations between the peasantry and the proletariat. 
Much remains to be done, and the outcome of this struggledepends upon whether we solve this problem or not. 
 Thus,the distribution of the burden of privation is one of the most difficult practical problems. 
 On the whole, the condition of the peasants has improved, but dire suffering has fallento the lot of the working class, precisely because it isexercising its dictatorship. 
 I have already said that in the spring of 1921 the most appalling want caused by the fodder shortage and the crop failure prevailed among the peasantry, which constitutes the majority of our population. 
 We cannot possibly existunless we have good relations with the peasant masses. 
Hence, our task was to render them immediate assistance. 
The condition of the working class is extremely hard. 
 Itis suffering horribly. 
 Those who have more political under-standing, however, realise that in the interest of the dictator-ship of the working class we must make tremendous effortsto help the peasants at any price. 
 The vanguard of the working class has realised this, but in that vanguard there are still people who cannot understand it, and who are too weary to understand it. 
 They regarded it as a mistake and began to use the word “opportunism”. 
 They said,“The Bolsheviks are helping the peasants. 
 The peasants,who are exploiting us, are getting everything they please,while the workers are starving. 
” But is that opportunism?We are helping the peasants because without an alliance with them the political power of the proletariat is im-possible, its preservation is inconceivable. 
 It was thisconsideration of expediency and not that of fair distributionthat was decisive for us. 
 We are assisting the peasantsbecause it is absolutely necessary to do so in order that wemay retain political power. 
 The supreme principle of the dictatorship is the maintenance of the alliance between the proletariat and the peasantry in order that the proletariatmay retain its leading role and its political power. 
 The only means we found for this was the adoption of the tax in kind, which was the inevitable consequence ofthe struggle. 
 This year, we shall introduce this tax for the first time. 
 This principle has not yet been tried in practice. 
 From the military alliance we must pass to an economicalliance, and, theoretically, the only basis for the latter isthe introduction of the tax in kind. 
 It provides the onlytheoretical possibility for laying a really solid economicfoundation for socialist society. 
 The socialised factory gives the peasant its manufactures and in return the peasant gives his grain. 
 This is the only possible form of existence ofsocialist society, the only form of socialist development ina country in which the small peasants constitute the majority,or at all events a very considerable minority. 
 The peasantswill give one part of their produce in the form of tax and another either in exchange for the manufactures of socialist factories, or through the exchange of commodities. 
 This brings us to the most difficult problem. 
 It goes without saying that the tax in kind means freedom to trade. 
After having paid the tax in kind, the peasant will havethe right freely to exchange the remainder of his grain. 
 This freedom of exchange implies freedom for capitalism. 
 We say this openly and emphasise it. 
 We do not conceal itin the least. 
 Things would go very hard with us if we attempted to conceal it. 
 Freedom to trade means freedom for capitalism, but it also means a new form of capitalism. 
 It means that, to a certain extent, we are re-creating capitalism. 
 We are doing this quite openly. 
 It is state capitalism. 
 Butstate capitalism in a society where power belongs to capital,and state capitalism in a proletarian state, are two differentconcepts. 
 In a capitalist state, state capitalism means thatit is recognised by the state and controlled by it for the benefit of the bourgeoisie, and to the detriment of the pro-letariat. 
 In the proletarian state, the same thing is donefor the benefit of the working class, for the purpose of with-standing the as yet strong bourgeoisie, and of fighting it. 
It goes without saying that we must grant concessions tothe foreign bourgeoisie, to foreign capital. 
 Without the slightest denationalisation, we shall lease mines, forests and oilfields to foreign capitalists, and receive in exchangemanufactured goods, machinery, etc. 
, and thus restore ourown industry. 
 Of course, we did not all agree on the question of state capitalism at once. 
 But we are very pleased to note in this connection that our peasantry has been developing, that it has fully realised the historical significance of the strugglewe are waging at the present time. 
 Ordinary peasants fromthe most remote districts have come to us and said: “What!We have expelled our capitalists, the capitalists who speakRussian, and now foreign capitalists are coming!” Does not this show that our peasants have developed? There is no need to explain to a worker who is versed in economicswhy this is necessary. 
 We have been so ruined by sevenyears of war that it will take many years to restore ourindustry. 
 We must pay for our backwardness and weakness,and for the lessons we are now learning and must learn. 
 Those who want to learn must pay for the tuition. 
 We must explain this to one and all, and if we prove it in practice,the vast masses of the peasants and workers will agree withus, because in this way their condition will be immediatelyimproved, and because it will ensure the possibility of restor-ing our industry. 
 What compels us to do this? We are not alone in the world. 
 We exist in a system of capitalist states. 
 139... On one side, there are the colonial countries, but they cannot help us yet. 
 On the other side, there are the capitalist countries, but they are our enemies. 
 The result is a certain equilibrium, a very poor one, it is true. 
 Never-theless, we must reckon with the fact. 
 We must not shut our eyes to it if we want to exist. 
 Either we score an imme-diate victory over the whole bourgeoisie, or we pay thetribute. 
 We admit quite openly, and do not conceal the fact, that concessions in the system of state capitalism mean paying tribute to capitalism. 
 But we gain time, and gaining time means gaining everything, particularly in the periodof equilibrium, when our foreign comrades are preparingthoroughly for their revolution. 
 The more thorough theirpreparations, the more certain will the victory be. 
 Mean-while, however, we shall have to pay the tribute. 
 A few words about our food policy. 
 Undoubtedly, it was a bad and primitive policy. 
 But we can also point to someachievements. 
 In this connection I must once again empha-sise that the only possible economic foundation of socialismis large-scale machine industry. 
 Whoever forgets this isno Communist. 
 We must analyse this problem concretely. 
 We cannot present problems in the way the theoreticians of the old school of socialism do. 
 We must present themin a practical manner. 
 What is modern large-scale industry?It is the electrification of the whole of Russia. 
 Sweden,Germany and America have almost achieved this, althoughthey are still bourgeois. 
 A Swedish comrade told me that in Sweden a large part of industry and thirty per cent of agri-culture are electrified. 
 In Germany and America, whichare even more developed capitalistically, we see the samething on a larger scale. 
 Large-scale machine industryis nothing more nor less than the electrification of the wholecountry. 
 We have already appointed a special commission consisting of the country’s best economists and engineers. 
 It is true that nearly all of them are hostile to the Sovietpower. 
 All these specialists will come over to communism,but not our way, not by way of twenty years of undergroundwork, during which we unceasingly studied and repeatedover and over again the ABC of communism. 
 Nearly all the Soviet government bodies were in favour of inviting the specialists. 
 The expert engineers will cometo us when we give them practical proof that this will increase the country’s productive forces. 
 It is not enough to prove it to them in theory; we must prove it to them in practice, and we shall win these people over to our side if we present the problem differently, not from the stand-point of the theoretical propaganda of communism. 
 Wesay: large-scale industry is the only means of saving the peas-antry from want and starvation. 
 Everyone agrees with this. 
But how can it be done? The restoration of industry on the old basis will entail too much labour and time. 
 We must give industry a more modern form, i. 
e. 
, we must adoptelectrification. 
 This will take much less time. 
 We havealready drawn up the plans for electrification. 
 More thantwo hundred specialists—almost to a man opposed to theSoviet power—worked on it with keen interest, although they are not Communists. 
 From the standpoint of technical science, however, they had to admit that this was the onlycorrect way. 
 Of course, we have a long way to go beforethe plan is achieved. 
 The cautious specialists say that thefirst series of works will take at least ten years. 
 ProfessorBallod has estimated that it would take three to four years to electrify Germany. 
 But for us even ten years is not enough. 
 In my theses I quote actual figures to show you how littlewe have been able to do in this sphere up to now. 
 The figuresI quote are so modest that it immediately becomes clearthat they are more of propaganda than scientific value. 
But we must begin with propaganda. 
 The Russian peasants who fought in the world war and lived in Germany for several years learned how modern farming should be carriedon in order to conquer famine. 
 We must carry on extensivepropaganda in this direction. 
 Taken by themselves, theseplans are not yet of great practical value, but their pro-paganda value is very great. 
 The peasants realise that something new must be created. 
 They realise that this cannot be done by everybody workingseparately, but by the state working as a whole. 
 The peas-ants who were prisoners of war in Germany found outwhat real cultural life is based on. 
 Twelve thousand kilo-watts is a very modest beginning. 
 This may sound funny to the foreigner who is familiar with electrification in Ameri-ca, Germany or Sweden. 
 But he laughs best who laughs last. 
It is, indeed, a modest beginning. 
 But the peasants are beginning to understand that new work must be carried out on a grand scale, and that this work has already begun. 
 Enormous difficulties will have to be overcome. 
 We shall try to establish relations with the capitalist countries. 
 Wemust not regret having to give the capitalists severalhundred million kilogrammes of oil on condition that theyhelp us to electrify our country. 
 And now, in conclusion, a few words about “ pure democ-racy ”. 
 I will read you a passage from Engels’s letter to Bebel of December 11, 1884. 
 He wrote: “Pure democracy ... when the moment of revolution comes, acquires a temporary importance as the extreme bourgeoisparty, as which it already played itself off in Frankfort,and as the final sheet-anchor of the whole bourgeois and even feudal economy .... 
 Thus between March and Septem-ber 1848 the whole feudal-bureaucratic mass strengthenedthe liberals in order to hold down the revolutionarymasses.... 
 In any case our sole adversary on the day of thecrisis and on the day after the crisis will be the whole of the reaction which will group around pure democracy , and this, I think, should not be lost sight of. 
” Our approach must differ from that of the theoreticians. 
 The whole reactionary mass, not only bourgeois, but alsofeudal, groups itself around “pure democracy”. 
 The Germancomrades know better than anyone else what “pure democ-racy” means, for Kautsky and the other leaders of the Second and the Two-and-a-Half Internationals are defending this “pure democracy” from the wicked Bolsheviks. 
 If wejudge the Russian Socialist-Revolutionaries and Menshe-viks, not by what they say, but by what they do, we shallfind that they are nothing but representatives of petty-bourgeois “pure democracy”. 
 In the course of our revolution they have given us a classic example of what “pure democracy” means, and again during the recent crisis, in thedays of the Kronstadt mutiny. 
 There was serious unrest amongthe peasantry, and discontent was also rife among the workers. 
They were weary and exhausted. 
 After all, there is a limitto human endurance. 
 They had starved for three years, but you cannot go on starving for four or five years. 
 Naturally, hunger has a tremendous influence on political activity. 
How did the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks behave? They wavered all the time, thereby strengthening the bourgeoisie. 
 The organisation of all the Russian parties abroad has revealed the present state of affairs. 
 The shrewd-est of the leaders of the Russian big bourgeoisie said tothemselves: “We cannot achieve victory in Russia immedi-ately. 
 Hence our slogan must be: ‘Soviets without theBolsheviks. 
’” Milyukov, the leader of the Constitutional-Democrats, defended the Soviet power from the attacks of the Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
 This sounds very strange; but such are the practical dialectics which we, in our revolu-tion, have been studying in a peculiar way, from the prac-tical experience of our struggle and of the struggle of ourenemies. 
 The Constitutional-Democrats defend “Sovietswithout the Bolsheviks” because they understand the posi-tion very well and hope that a section of the people will rise to the bait. 
 That is what the clever Constitutional-Democrats say. 
 Not all the Constitutional-Democrats areclever, of course, but some of them are, and these havelearned something from the French Revolution. 
 The presentslogan is to fight the Bolsheviks, whatever the price, come what may. 
 The whole of the bourgeoisie is now helping the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, who are nowthe vanguard of all reaction. 
 In the spring we had a tasteof the fruits of this counter-revolutionary co-operation. 
 140 That is why we must continue our relentless struggle against these elements. 
 Dictatorship is a state of intense war. 
 That is just the state we are in. 
 There is no military invasion at present; but we are isolated. 
 On the other hand,however, we are not entirely isolated, since the wholeinternational bourgeoisie is incapable of waging open waragainst us just now, because the whole working class, eventhough the majority is not yet communist, is sufficiently class-conscious to prevent intervention. 
 The bourgeoisie is compelled to reckon with the temper of the masses eventhough they have not yet entirely sided with communism. 
That is why the bourgeoisie cannot now start an offensiveagainst us, although one is never ruled out. 
 Until the finalissue is decided, this awful state of war will continue. 
 And we say: “ A la guerre comme à la guerre ; we do not promise any freedom, or any democracy. 
” We tell the peasantsquite openly that they must choose between the rule of the bourgeoisie, and the rule of the Bolsheviks—in which case we shall make every possible concession within the limits of retaining power, and later we shall lead them to socialism. 
 Everything else is deception and pure demagogy. 
 Ruthlesswar must be declared against this deception and demagogy. 
Our point of view is: for the time being—big concessionsand the greatest caution, precisely because a certain equi-librium has set in, precisely because we are weaker than our combined enemies, and because our economic basis is too weak and we need a stronger one. 
 That, comrades, is what I wanted to tell you about our tactics, the tactics of the Russian Communist Party. 
(Prolonged applause . 
) IDEAS ABOUT A STATE ECONOMIC “PLAN ” The principal mistake we have all been making up to now is too much optimism; as a result, we succumbed tobureaucratic utopias. 
 Only a very small part of our plans has been realised. 
 Life, everyone, in fact, has laughed at our plans. 
 This must be radically altered. 
Anticipate the worst. 
 We already have some experience; it is slight, but practical. 
 Food supplies? Frumkin says: The ideal is 150 million poods from the tax $50 million poods by means of exchange $40 million poods from the Ukraine =240 million poods. 
 We must base our calculations on a total of /FL006300 million poods for the year. 
 What are we to do with this paltry, starvation figure? 200 : 12 =16q. 
 (α) Take a minimum for the army, i. 
e. 
, calculate the rations for a minimum army. 
 (β) Include in the plan the economic work of the army on a modest, extremely modest scale. 
 1 subbotnik *, 60 per cent of the army (participating). 
 1 out of 3 subbotniks 50 per cent participants (50 per cent of the army), etc. 
 (γ) For office employees—drastic reduction. 
 (δ) The workers. 
 Immediately draw up a list of the best enterprises (stress enterprises ) by industries. 
 Close down @ to T of those now running. 
 The rest to run in two shifts. 
 Only those which have enough fuel and bread , even if the minimum quantity of grain is collected (200 million poods) and fuel (?) for the whole year . 
 Do this in rough outline , as a first approximation, imme-diately, in a month, no later. 
 Fuel, we have. 
 A People’s Commissariat for Communications, we have. 
 *Voluntary work on week-ends without pay. 
— Tr. 
 There is no need to be exact about food; take /FL006300 million poods . 
 Industry according to branches and gubernias (don’t put it off until we get the figures for the “whole”), get thisdone with the utmost speed, and, the main thing , put 70 per cent of the members of the State Planning Com-mission to work 14 hours a day (let science sweat a bit; we have given them good rations, now we must make them work). 
 Each one to be given the task of keeping “ general super-vision ” (I think that is what it is called in the regulations of the State Planning Commission) over definite enterprises. 
 Take 700 as the number of large establishments, enter-prises, depots (railway), state farms, etc. 
, etc. 
, that we must (and can, even at the worst: 200 million poods of grain in the course of the year) start and keep running from October1, 1921 to October 1, 1922. 
 700 : 35 members of the Slate Planning Commission = /FL00630. 
 Say 30 (not all the members of the State Planning Com-mission will be continuously engaged on current work). 
 Take the trouble to supervise these 30 unremittingly . 
 You are responsible for this. 
 Over and above these, keep an eye on another 30 -70, less important; don’t keep them under constant observation,but make inquiries in passing, from time to time. 
 To supervise unremittingly means answering with your head for the rational consumption of fuel and grain, for the maximum stocking of the one and the other, for themaximum deliveries, for economising fuel (in industry, onthe railways, etc. 
), for economising food (feed only good workers), for increasing productivity of labour, etc. 
 All the rest—lease or give to anybody you please, or close, or “abandon”, forget about, until a sound improvement is achieved, which will enable us to operate confidently, notwith 200 million poods of grain $X million poods of fuel, but with 300 million poods of grain $150 per cent of X fuel. 
 These are my ideas about the State Planning Commission. 
Think it over . 
 Let’s discuss it. 
 July 4 Lenin First published in 1924 Published according to the manuscript GREETING S TO THE DELEGAT E CONGRESS OF TSENTROSOYU Z141 I send my greetings to the assembly of Tsentrosoyuz delegates on behalf of the Council of People’s Commissars and of the Central Committee of the R. 
C. 
P. 
 I deeply regretthat I cannot be present to express my views on the mostcomplicated problems confronting the co-operative socie-ties. 
 I have no doubt that the pooling of experience of the work already done will help you to solve these problems inharmony with the plan for the country’s overall economicdevelopment. 
 Success in the practical work that now liesahead will depend largely on the establishment, throughthe medium of commodity exchange, of proper relations between urban industry and agriculture. 
 It will depend on the ability of the co-operative societies, by steady andpersistent effort, to clear the way for the development ofcommodity exchange and to take the lead in this field. 
 It willdepend on their ability to collect the scattered stocks ofcommodities and to secure the production of new ones. 
 In the long run, the practical solution of these problems is the best way to achieve our aims, namely, to restoreagriculture and, on that basis, to strengthen and developlarge-scale industry. 
 These problems have been complicated very much by the crop failure, which has become apparent in a number of gubernias. 
 In your work, you will have to devote special attention to this fresh disaster and keep its consequencesin mind when tackling all current questions. 
 I am sure that, short as the experience of work under the new conditions may be, Soviet co-operative societies will succeed in closely linking up their work with the gen-eral task of overcoming the chaos in the country’s economy,and will display the utmost energy in this fight. 
 Written on July 16, 1921 Published in Pravda No. 
 156, Published according July 19, 1921 to the Pravda text MESSAG E OF GREETINGS TO THE FIRS T INTERNATIONA L CONGRESS OF REVOLUTIONAR Y TRADE AND INDUSTRIA L UNION S142 July 18 Comrade Rykov, Please be so kind as to convey to the delegates of the International Congress of Trade Unions the following: I thank them from the bottom of my heart for the invi-tation to the Congress sent through you. 
 I deeply regret that I am unable to accept it because of ill-health, for ondoctor’s orders I have had to leave Moscow for a month’s holiday. 
 Please convey to the delegates my greetings and heartfelt wishes for the success of the Congress. 
 It is hard to find words to express the full importance of the International Congressof Trade Unions. 
 The winning of trade unionists to the ideasof communism is making irresistible headway everywhere, in all countries, throughout the world. 
 The process is spo-radic, overcoming a thousand obstacles, but it is makingirresistible progress. 
 The International Congress of TradeUnions will quicken this movement. 
 Communism willtriumph in the trade unions. 
 No power on earth can avertthe collapse of capitalism and the victory of the working class over the bourgeoisie. 
 Warm greetings and confidence in the inevitable victory of communism.

 Lenin Published in 1921 Published according to the manuscript APPEAL TO THE INTERNATIONA L PROLETARIA T143 Several gubernias in Russia have been hit by a famine whose proportions are apparently only slightly less than those of the 1891 calamity. 
 It is the painful aftermath of Russia’s backwardness and of seven years of war, first, the imperialist, and then,the Civil War, which was forced upon the workers and peasants by the landowners and capitalists of all countries. 
 We need help. 
 The Soviet Republic of workers and peasants expects this help from the working people, the industrial workers and the small farmers. 
 The mass of both the former and the latter are themselves oppressed by capitalism and imperialism everywhere, but we are convinced that they will respond to our appeal, despite their own hard condition caused by unemploymentand the rising cost of living. 
 Those who have suffered from capitalist oppression all their lives will understand the position of the workersand peasants of Russia, they will grasp or, guided by the instinct of working and exploited people, will sense the need of helping the Soviet Republic, whose lot it was to bethe first to undertake the hard but gratifying task of over-throwing capitalism. 
 That is why the capitalists of allcountries are revenging themselves upon the Soviet Republic;that is why they are planning a fresh campaign, intervention, and counter-revolutionary conspiracies against it. 
 All the greater, we trust, will be the vigour and the self-sacrifice with which the workers and the small labouring farmers of all countries will help us.

 The workers and peasants in thefamine-stricken Volga area, who are now suffering hardshipsonly a little less severe than the dreadful calamity of 1891,look to the Ukrainian farmers for help. 
 Help must comequickly. 
 Help must be abundant. 
 No farmer must refrain from sharing his surplus with the starving Volga peasants who have no seed with which to sow their fields. 
 Let every uyezd that is well supplied with grain send, say, two or three peasant delegates to the Volga to deliverthe grain, and to see for themselves the terrible suffering,want and starvation, and tell their fellow-countrymen upon their return how urgently help is needed.

 MYASNIKO V144 August 5, 1921 Comrade Myasnikov, I have only just managed to read both your articles. 
 I am unaware of the nature of the speeches you made in the Perm (I think it was Perm) organisation and of your conflict with it. 
 I can say nothing about that; it will bedealt with by the Organisation Bureau, which, I hear, hasappointed a special commission. 
 My object is a different one: it is to appraise your articles as literary and political documents. 
 They are interesting documents. 
Your main mistake is, I think, most clearly revealed in the article “Vexed Questions”. 
 And I consider it myduty to do all I can to try to convince you. 
 At the beginning of the article you make a correct appli-cation of dialectics. 
 Indeed, whoever fails to understand the substitution of the slogan of “civil peace” for the slogan of “civil war” lays himself open to ridicule, if nothing worse. 
In this, you are right. 
 But precisely because you are right on this point, I am surprised that in drawing your conclusions, you shouldhave forgotten the dialectics which you yourself had properly applied. 
 “Freedom of the press, from the monarchists to the anarch-ists, inclusively” .... 
 Very good! But just a minute: every Marxist and every worker who ponders over the four years’ experience of our revolution will say “Let’slook into this— what sort of freedom of the press? What for? For which class ?” We do not believe in “absolutes”. 
 We laugh at “pure democracy”. 
 The “freedom of the press” slogan became a great world slogan at the close of the Middle Ages and remained so up to the nineteenth century. 
 Why? Because it expressed the ideas of the progressive bourgeoisie, i. 
e. 
, its struggle againstkings and priests, feudal lords and landowners. 
 No country in the world has done as much to liberate the masses from the influence of priests and landowners as the R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R has done, and is doing. 
 We have been performing this function of “freedom of the press” better than anyone else in the world. 
 All over the world, wherever there are capitalists, freedom of the press means freedom to buy up newspapers, to buy writers, to bribe , buy and fake “public opinion” for the benefit of the bourgeoisie . 
 This is a fact. 
 No one will ever be able to refute it. 
And what about us?Can anyone deny that the bourgeoisie in this country has been defeated, but not destroyed ? That it has gone into hiding ? Nobody can deny it. 
 Freedom of the press in the R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
, which is sur-rounded by the bourgeois enemies of the whole world, meansfreedom of political organisation for the bourgeoisie and its most loyal servants, the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
 This is an irrefutable fact. 
 The bourgeoisie (all over the world) is still very much stronger than we are. 
 To place in its hands yet another weapon like freedom of political organisation ( =freedom of the press, for the press is the core and foundation ofpolitical organisation) means facilitating the enemy’s task,means helping the class enemy. 
 We have no wish to commit suicide, and therefore, we will not do this. 
 We clearly see this fact: “freedom of the press” means in practice that the international bourgeoisie will imme-diately buy up hundreds and thousands of Cadet, Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik writers, and will organise their propaganda and fight against us. 
 That is a fact. 
 “They” are richer than we are and will buy a “force” ten times larger than we have, to fight us. 
 No, we will not do it; we will not help the international bourgeoisie. 
 How could you descend from a class appraisal—from the appraisal of the relations between all classes—to the sentimental, philistine appraisal? This is a mystery to me. 
 On the question: “civil peace or civil war”, on the ques-tion of how we have won over, and will continue to “win over”, the peasantry (to the side of the proletariat), on these two key world questions ( =questions that affect the very substance of world politics), on these questions (which are dealt with in both your articles), you were able to take the Marxist standpoint, instead of the philistine, senti-mental standpoint. 
 You did take account of the relationships of all classes in a practical , sober way. 
 And suddenly you slide down into the abyss of senti-mentalism! “Outrage and abuses are rife in this country: freedom of the press will expose them. 
” That, as far as I can judge from your two articles, is where you slipped up. 
 You have allowed yourself to be depressed by certain sad and deplorable facts , and lost the ability soberly to appraise the forces. 
 Freedom of the press will help the force of the world bour-geoisie. 
 That is a fact. 
 “Freedom of the press” will not help to purge the Communist Party in Russia of a number of its weaknesses, mistakes, misfortunes and maladies (it cannot be denied that there is a spate of these maladies), because this is not what the world bourgeoisie wants. 
 But freedom of the press will be a weapon in the hands of this world bourgeoisie . 
 It is not dead; it is alive. 
 It is lurking nearby and watching. 
 It has already hired Milyukov, to whom Chernov and Martov (partly because of their stu-pidity, and partly because of factional spleen against us; but mainly because of the objective logic of their petty-bourgeois-democratic position) are giving “faithful andloyal ” service. 
 You took the wrong fork in the road. 
You wanted to cure the Communist Party of its maladies and have snatched at a drug that will cause certain death— not at your hands, of course, but at the hands of the worldbourgeoisie ( $Milyukov $Chernov $Martov). 
 You forgot a minor point, a very tiny point, namely: the world bourgeoisie and its “freedom” to buy up for itself newspapers, and centres of political organisation . 
 No, we will not take this course. 
 Nine hundred out of every thousand politically conscious workers will refuse to take this course. 
 We have many maladies. 
 Mistakes (our common mistakes, all of us have made mistakes, the Council of Labour and Defence, the Council of People’s Commissars and the Central Committee) like those we made in distributing fueland food in the autumn and winter of 1920 (those were enormous mistakes!) have greatly aggravated the maladiesspringing from our situation. 
 Want and calamity abound. 
 They have been terribly intensified by the famine of 1921. 
 It will cost us a supreme effort to extricate ourselves, but we will get out, and have already begun to do so. 
 We will extricate ourselves, for, in the main, our policy is a correct one, and takes into account all the class forces on an international scale. 
 We will extricate ourselves because we do not try to make our position look better thanit is. 
 We realise all the difficulties. 
 We see all the maladies, and are taking measures to cure them methodically, withperseverance, and without giving way to panic. 
 You have allowed panic to get the better of you; panic is a slope—once you stepped on it you slid down into a position that looks very much as if you are forming a newparty, or are about to commit suicide. 
 You must not give way to panic. 
Is there any isolation of the Communist Party cells from the Party? There is. 
 It is an evil, a misfortune, a malaise. 
 It is there. 
 It is a severe ailment. 
We can see it. 
It must be cured by proletarian and Party measures and not by means of “freedom” ( for the bourgeoisie ). 
 Much of what you say about reviving the country’s economy, about mechanical ploughs, etc. 
, about fighting for “influence” over the peasantry, etc. 
, is true anduseful. 
 Why not bring this out separately? We shall get together and work harmoniously in one party. 
 The benefits will be great; they will not come all at once , but very slowly. 
 Revive the Soviets; secure the co-operation of non-Party people; let non-Party people verify the work of Party members: this is absolutely right. 
 No end of work there, and it has hardly been started. 
 Why not amplify this in a practical way? In a pamphlet for the Congress? Why not take that up?Why be afraid of spade work ( denounce abuses through the Central Control Commission, or the Party press, Pravda )? Misgivings about slow, difficult and arduous spade workcause people to give way to panic and to seek an “easy” way out: “freedom of the press” ( for the bourgeoisie ). 
 Why should you persist in your mistake—an obvious mistake—in your non-Party, anti-proletarian slogan of “freedom of the press”? Why not take up the less “brilliant”(scintillating with bourgeois brilliance) spade work ofdriving out abuses, combating them, and helping non-Party people in a practical and business-like way ? Have you ever brought up any particular abuse to the notice of the C. 
C. 
, and suggested a definite means of eradi-cating it? No, you have not. 
Not a single time. 
 You saw a spate of misfortunes and maladies, gave way to despair and rushed into the arms of the enemy, thebourgeoisie (“freedom of the press” for the bourgeoisie ). 
 My advice is: do not give way to despair and panic. 
 We, and those who sympathise with us, the workers and peasants, still have an immense reservoir of strength. 
 We still have plenty of health and vigour. 
 We are not doing enough to cure our ailments. 
We are not doing a good job of practising the slogan: promote non-Party people, let non-Party people verifythe work of Party members. 
 But we can, and will, do a hundred times more in this field than we are doing. 
 I hope that after thinking this over carefully you will not, out of false pride, persist in an obvious political mistake (“freedom of the press”), but, pulling yourself together and overcoming the panic, will get down to practical work: help to establish ties with non-Party people, and help non-Party people to verify the work of Party members. 
 There is no end of work in this field. 
 Doing this work you can (and should) help to cure the disease, slowly but surely, instead of chasing after will -o’-the-wisps like “freedom of the press”. 
 With communist greetings, Lenin Published in 1921 Published according to the manuscript TO COMRADE THOMAS BELL Dear comrade, I thank you very much for your letter, of August 7. 
 I have read nothing concerning the English movement lastmonths because of my illness and overwork. 
 It is extremely interesting what you communicate. 
 Per-haps it is the beginning of the real proletarian mass move-ment in Great Britain in the communist sense . 
 I am afraid we have till now in England few very feeble propagandistsocieties for communism (inclusive the British CommunistParty 145) but no really mass communist movement. 
 If the South Wales Miners’ Federation has decided on July 24 to affiliate to the Third International by a majorityof 120 to 63—perhaps it is the beginning of a new era. 
(How many miners there are in England? More than 500,000?How much in South Wales? 25,000? How many minerswere really represented in Cardiff July 24, 1921?) If these miners are not too small minority, if they fraternise with soldiers and begin a real “class war”—we must do all our possible to develop this movement and strengthen it. 
 Economic measures (like communal kitchens) are good but they are not much important now , before the victory of the proletarian revolution in England. 
 Now the political struggle is the most important. 
 English capitalists are shrewd, clever, astute. 
 They will support (directly or indirectly) communal kitchens in order to divert the attention from political aims . 
 What is important is (if I am not mistaken): 1) To create a very good, really proletarian, really mass Communist Party in this part of England, that is, such party which will really be the leading force in all labour movement in this part of the country. 
 (Apply the resolu-tion on organisation and work of the Party adopted by the Third Congress to this part of your country. 
) 2) To start a daily paper of the working class, for the working class in this part of the country. 
 To start it not as a business (as usually newspapers are started in capitalist countries), not with big sum of money,not in ordinary and usual manner—but as an economic and political tool of the masses in their struggle. 
 Either the miners of this district are capable to pay halfpenny daily (for the beginning weekly , if you like) for their own daily (or weekly) newspaper (be it very small, it is not important)— or there is no beginning of really communist mass movement in this part of your country . 
 If the Communist Party of this district cannot collect a few pounds in order to publish small leaflets daily as a beginning of the really proletarian communist newspaper— if it is so, if every miner will not pay a penny for it, then there is not serious , not genuine affiliation to the Third International. 
 English Government will apply the shrewdest means in order to suppress every beginning of this kind. 
 Thereforewe must be (in the beginning) very prudent. 
 The papermust be not too revolutionary in the beginning. 
 If you will have three editors, at least one must be non-communist . 
 (At least two genuine workers. 
) If nine-tenths of the workers 120do not buy this paper, if two-thirds (120$63) do not pay special contributions (f. 
 1 penny weekly ) for their paper— it will be no workers’ newspaper. 
 I should be very glad to have few lines from you concern-ing this theme and beg to apologise for my bad English.

 21, January 27, 1927 A LETTER TO THE GERMAN COMMUNISTS Dear comrades, I had intended to state my view of the lessons of the Third Congress of the Communist International in a detailed article. 
 Unfortunately, I have not yet been able to start onthis work because of ill-health. 
 The fact that a Congress ofyour Party, the United Communist Party of Germany(V. 
K. 
P. 
D. 
), 146 has been called for August 22, compels me to hasten with this letter, which I have to finish within a few hours, if I am not to be late in sending it to Germany. 
 So far as I can judge, the position of the Communist Party in Germany is a particularly difficult one. 
 This isunderstandable. 
 Firstly, and mainly, from the end of 1918, the interna-tional position of Germany very quickly and sharply aggra-vated her internal revolutionary crisis and impelled the vanguard of the proletariat towards an immediate seizureof power. 
 At the same time, the German and the entireinternational bourgeoisie, excellently armed and organised,and taught by the “Russian experience “, hurled itselfupon the revolutionary proletariat of Germany in a frenzy of hate. 
 Tens of thousands of the best people of Germany— her revolutionary workers—were killed or tortured todeath by the bourgeoisie, its heroes, Noske and Co. 
, itsservants, the Scheidemanns, etc. 
, and by its indirect and“subtle” (and therefore particularly valuable) accomplices,the knights of the “Two-and-a-Half International”, with their despicable spinelessness, vacillations, pedantry and philistinism. 
 The armed capitalists set traps for the un-armed workers; they killed them wholesale, murdered their leaders, ambushing them one by one, and making excel-lent use to this end of the counter-revolutionary howling of both shades of Social-Democrats, the Scheidemannites and the Kautskyites. 
 When the crisis broke out, however,the German workers lacked a genuine revolutionary party,owing to the fact that the split was brought about too late,and owing to the burden of the accursed tradition of “unity”with capital’s corrupt (the Scheidemanns, Legiens, Davids and Co. 
) and spineless (the Kautskys, Hilferdings and Co. 
) gang of lackeys. 
 The heart of every honest and class-conscious worker who accepted the Basle Manifesto of 1912 147 at its face value and not as a “gesture” on the part of thescoundrels of the “Second” and the “Two-and-a-Half”grades, was filled with incredibly bitter hatred for the opportunism of the old German Social-Democrats, and this hatred—the greatest and most noble sentiment of the bestpeople among the oppressed and exploited masses—blindedpeople and prevented them from keeping their heads andworking out a correct strategy with which to reply to theexcellent strategy of the Entente capitalists, who were armed, organised and schooled by the “Russian experience”, and supported by France, Britain and America. 
 This hatredpushed them into premature insurrections. 
 That is why the development of the revolutionary working-class movement in Germany has since the end of 1918been treading a particularly hard and painful road. 
 But it has marched and is marching steadily forward. 
 There is the incontrovertible fact of the gradual swing to the leftamong the masses of workers, the real majority of thelabouring and exploited people in Germany, both thoseorganised in the old, Menshevik trade unions (i. 
e. 
, theunions serving the bourgeoisie) and those entirely, or almost entirely, unorganised. 
 What the German proletariat must and will do—and this is the guarantee of victory—iskeep their heads; systematically rectify the mistakes ofthe past; steadily win over the mass of the workers bothinside and outside the trade unions; patiently build up astrong and intelligent Communist Party capable of giving real leadership to the masses at every turn of events; and work out a strategy that is on a level with the best inter-national strategy of the most advanced bourgeoisie, which is “enlightened” by agelong experience in general, and the “Russian experience” in particular. 
 On the other hand, the difficult position of the Communist Party of Germany is aggravated at the present moment bythe break-away of the not very good Communists on the left(the Communist Workers’ Party of Germany, K. 
A. 
P. 
D. 
)and on the right (Paul Levi and his little magazine Unser Weg or Sowjet148). 
 Beginning with the Second Congress of the Communist International, the Leftists” or “K. 
A. 
P. 
-ists” have receivedsufficient warning from us in the international arena. 
Until sufficiently strong, experienced and influential Com-munist Parties have been built, at least in the principalcountries, the participation of semi-anarchist elements in our international congresses has to be tolerated, and is to some extent even useful. 
 It is useful insofar as theseelements serve as a clear “warning” to inexperienced Com-munists, and also insofar as they themselves are still capableof learning. 
 All over the world, anarchism has been split-ting up—not since yesterday, but since the beginning of the imperialist war of 1914-18—into two trends: one pro-Soviet, and the other anti-Soviet; one in favour of the dictatorshipof the proletariat, and the other against it. 
 We must allowthis process of disintegration among the anarchists to goon and come to a head. 
 Hardly anyone in Western Europehas experienced anything like a big revolution. 
 There, the experience of great revolutions has been almost entirely forgotten, and the transition from the desire to be revolu-tionary and from talk (and resolutions) about revolutionto real revolutionary work is very difficult, painful andslow. 
 It goes without saying, however, that the semi-anarchist elements can and should be tolerated only within certain limits. 
 In Germany, we tolerated them for quite a longtime. 
 The Third Congress of the Communist Internationalfaced them with an ultimatum and fixed a definite timelimit. 
 If they have now voluntarily resigned from the Com-munist International, all the better. 
 Firstly, they have saved us the trouble of expelling them. 
 Secondly, it has now been demonstrated most conclusively and most graphi-cally, and proved with precise facts to all vacillating work-ers, and all those who have been inclined towards anarchism because of their hatred for the opportunism of the old Social-Democrats, that the Communist International has been patient, that it has not expelled anarchists immediatelyand unconditionally, and that it has given them an atten-tive hearing and helped them to learn. 
 We must now pay less attention to the K. 
A. 
P. 
-ists. 
 By polemising with them we merely give them publicity. 
 They are too unintelligent; it is wrong to take them seriously; and it is not worth being angry with them. 
 Theyhave no influence among the masses, and will acquire none,unless we make mistakes. 
 Let us leave this tiny trend todie a natural death; the workers themselves will realisethat it is worthless. 
 Let us propagate and implement, with greater effect, the organisational and tactical decisions of the Third Congress of the Communist International, insteadof giving the K. 
A. 
P. 
-ists publicity by arguing with them. 
The infantile disorder of “Leftism” is passing and willpass away as the movement grows. 
 Similarly we are now needlessly helping Paul Levi, we are needlessly giving him publicity by polemising with him. 
 That we should argue with him is exactly what hewants. 
 Now, after the decisions of the Third Congressof the Communist International, we must forget about himand devote all our attention, all our efforts, to peaceful,practical and constructive work (without any squabbling, polemics, or bringing up of the quarrels of yesterday), in the spirit of the decisions of the Third Congress. 
 It is myconviction that Comrade K. 
 Radek’s article, “The ThirdWorld Congress on the March Action, and Future Tactics” (inDie Rote Fahne , 149 the Central Organ of the United Commu-nist Party of Germany, issues of July 14 and 15, 1921), sins quite considerably against this general and unanimously adopted decision of the Third Congress. 
 This article, acopy of which was sent me by one of the Polish Communists,is quite unnecessarily—and in a way that positively harmsour work—directed not only against Paul Levi (that wouldbe very unimportant), but also against Clara Zetkin. 
 And yet Clara Zetkin herself concluded a “peace treaty” in Mos-cow, during the Third Congress, with the C. 
C. 
 (the “Centra-le”) of the United Communist Party of Germany, providing for joint, non-factional work! And we all approved of the treaty. 
 In his misplaced polemical zeal, Comrade K. 
 Radek has gone to the length of saying something positively untrue, attributing to Zetkin the idea of “putting off”(verlegt ) “every general action by the Party” ( jede allgemeine Aktion der Partei ) “until the day when large masses rise” ( auf den Tag , wo die grossen Massen aufstehen werden ). 
 It goes without saying that by such methods Comrade K. 
 Radek is rendering Paul Levi the best service the latter could wish for. 
 There is nothing Paul Levi wants so much as acontroversy endlessly dragged out, with as many peopleinvolved in it as possible, and efforts to drive Zetkin awayfrom the party by polemical breaches of the “peace treaty”which she herself concluded, and which was approved by the entire Communist International. 
 Comrade K. 
 Radek’s article serves as an excellent example of how Paul Leviis assisted from the “Left”. 
 Here I must explain to the German comrades why I defended Paul Levi so long at the Third Congress. 
 Firstly,because I made Levi’s acquaintance through Radek in Switzerland in 1915 or 1916. 
 At that time Levi was already a Bolshevik. 
 I cannot help entertaining a certain amountof distrust towards those who accepted Bolshevism only after its victory in Russia, and after it had scored a number of victories in the international arena. 
 But, of course, thisreason is relatively unimportant, for, after all, my personal knowledge of Paul Levi is very small. 
 Incomparably more important was the second reason, namely, that es-sentially much of Levi’s criticism of the March action in Germany in 1921 was correct (not, of course, when he said that the uprising was a “putsch”; that assertion of hiswas absurd). 
 It is true that Levi did all he possibly could, and much besides, to weaken and spoil his criticism, and make itdifficult for himself and others to understand the essenceof the matter, by bringing in a mass of details in whichhe was obviously wrong. 
 Levi couched his criticism in animpermissible and harmful form. 
 While urging others to pursue a cautious and well-considered strategy, Levi him-self committed worse blunders than a schoolboy, by rushinginto battle so prematurely, so unprepared, so absurdly and wildly that he was certain to lose any “battle” (spoil-ing or hampering his work for many years), although the “battle” could and should have been won. 
 Levi behaved like an “anarchist intellectual” (if I am not mistaken, theGerman term is Edelanarchist ), instead of behaving like an organised member of the proletarian Communist Interna-tional. 
 Levi committed a breach of discipline. 
 By this series of incredibly stupid blunders Levi made it difficult to concentrate attention on the essence of the matter. 
 And the essence of the matter, i. 
e. 
, the appraisaland correction of the innumerable mistakes made by the United Communist Party of Germany during the Marchaction of 1921, has been and continues to be of enormousimportance. 
 In order to explain and correct these mistakes (which some people enshrined as gems of Marxist tactics) it was necessary to have been on the Right wing during the Third Congress of the Communist International. 
 Otherwisethe line of the Communist International would have been a wrong one. 
 I defended and had to defend Levi, insofar as I saw before me opponents of his who merely shouted about “Menshe-vism” and “Centrism” and refused to see the mistakes ofthe March action and the need to explain and correct them. 
These people made a caricature of revolutionary Marxism,and a pastime of the struggle against “Centrism”. 
 Theymight have done the greatest harm to the whole cause, for “no one in the world can compromise the revolutionary Marxists, if they do not compromise themselves”. 
 I said to these people: Granted that Levi has become a Menshevik. 
 As I have scant knowledge of him personally,I will not insist, if the point is proved to me. 
 But it hasnot yet been proved. 
 All that has been proved till now is that he has lost his head . 
 It is childishly stupid to declare a man a Menshevik merely on these grounds. 
 The trainingof experienced and influential party leaders is a long anddifficult job. 
 And without it the dictatorship of the prole-tariat, and its “unity of will”, remain a phrase. 
 In Russia,it took us fifteen years (1903-17) to produce a group of leaders—fifteen years of fighting Menshevism, fifteen years of tsarist persecution, fifteen years, which included the years ofthe first revolution (1905), a great and mighty revolution. 
 Yet we have had our sad cases, when even fine comrades have “lost their heads”. 
 If the West-European comrades imagine that they are insured against such “sad cases” it is sheer childishness, and we cannot but combat it. 
 Levi had to be expelled for breach of discipline. 
 Tactics had to be determined on the basis of a most detailed expla-nation and correction of the mistakes made during theMarch 1921 action. 
 If, after this, Levi wants to behave in the old way, he will show that his expulsion was justified; and the wavering or hesitant workers will be given allthe more forceful and convincing proof of the absolutecorrectness of the Third Congress decisions concerning PaulLevi. 
 Having made a cautious approach at the Congress to the appraisal of Levi’s mistakes, I can now say with all the more assurance that Levi has hastened to confirm theworst expectations. 
 I have before me No. 
 6 of his magazineUnser Weg (of July 15, 1921). 
 It is evident from the editorial note printed at the head of the magazine that thedecisions of the Third Congress are known to Paul Levi. 
 What is his reply to them? Menshevik catchwords such as “a great excommunication” ( grosser Bann ), “canon law” ( ka-nonisches Recht ), and that he will “quite freely” ( in voll-ständiger Freiheit ) “discuss” these decisions. 
 What greater freedom can a man have if he has been freed of the titleof party member and member of the Communist Interna-tional! And please note that he expects party members to write for him, for Levi, anonymously! First—he plays a dirty trick on the party, hits it in the back, and sabotages its work. 
 Then—he discusses the essence of the Congress decisions. 
That is magnificent. 
 But by doing this Levi puts paid to himself. 
 Paul Levi wants to continue the fight. 
It will be a great strategic error to satisfy his desire. 
 I would advise the German comrades to prohibit all con-troversy with Levi and his magazine in the columns ofthe daily party press. 
 He must not be given publicity. 
 He must not he allowed to divert the fighting party’s attention from important matters to unimportant ones. 
 Incases of extreme necessity, the controversy could be conducted in weekly or monthly magazines, or in pamphlets, and as far as possible care must be taken not to afford the K. 
A. 
P. 
-ists and Paul Levi the pleasure they feel when they are mentioned by name; reference should simplybe made to “certain not very clever critics who at all costswant to regard themselves as Communists”. 
 I am informed that at the last meeting of the enlarged C. 
C. 
 ( Ausschuss ), even the Left-winger Friesland was com-pelled to launch a sharp attack on Maslow, who is playing at Leftism and wishes to exercise himself in “huntingCentrists”. 
 The unreasonableness (to put it mildly) of thisMaslow’s conduct was also revealed over here, in Moscow. 
Really, this Maslow and two or three of his supportersand confederates, who obviously do not wish to observe the “peace treaty” and have more zeal than sense, should be sent by the German party to Soviet Russia for a yearor two. 
 We would find useful work for them. 
 We wouldmake men of them. 
 And the international and Germanmovement would certainly gain thereby. 
 The German Communists must at all costs end the in-ternal dissension, get rid of the quarrelsome elements on both sides, forget about Paul Levi and the K. 
A. 
P. 
-istsand get down to real work. 
 There is plenty to be done. 
 In my opinion, the tactical and organisational resolu-tions of the Third Congress of the Communist Internationalmark a great step forward. 
 Every effort must be exertedto really put both resolutions into effect. 
 This is a difficultmatter, but it can and should be done. 
 First, the Communists had to proclaim their principles to the world. 
 That was done at the First Congress. 
 It wasthe first step. 
 The second step was to give the Communist International organisational form and to draw up conditions for affiliationto it—conditions making for real separation from the Cen-trists, from the direct and indirect agents of the bourgeoisie within the working-class movement. 
 That was done at theSecond Congress. 
 At the Third Congress it was necessary to start practical, constructive work, to determine concretely, taking account of the practical experience of the communist struggle already begun, exactly what the line of further activity should be in respect of tactics and of organisation. 
 We have takenthis third step. 
 We have an army of Communists all overthe world. 
 It is still poorly trained and poorly organised. 
It would be extremely harmful to forget this truth or be afraid of admitting it. 
 Submitting ourselves to a most care-ful and rigorous test, and studying the experience of ourown movement, we must train this army efficiently; wemust organise it properly, and test it in all sorts ofmanoeuvres, all sorts of battles, in attack and in retreat. 
We cannot win without this long and hard schooling. 
 The “crux” of the situation in the international commu-nist movement in the summer of 1921 was that some of thebest and most influential sections of the Communist Inter-national did not quite properly understand this task; they exaggerated the “struggle against Centrism” ever so slightly ; they went ever so slightly beyond the border line at which this struggle turns into a pastime and revolutionary Marxism begins to be compromised. 
 That was the “crux” of the Third Congress. 
The exaggeration was a slight one; but the danger arising out of it was enormous. 
 It was difficult to combat it, be-cause the exaggerating was done by really the best and most loyal elements, without whom the formation of the Commu-nist International would, perhaps, have been impossible. 
In the tactical amendments published in the newspaperMoskau 150 in German, French and English and signed by the German, Austrian and Italian delegations, this exaggeration was definitely revealed—the more so because these amendments were proposed to a draft resolution thatwas already final (following long and all-round preparatory work): The rejection of these amendments was a straighten-ing out of the line of the Communist International; it was a victory over the danger of exaggeration. 
 Exaggeration, if not corrected, was sure to kill the Com-munist International. 
 For “no one in the world can compro-mise the revolutionary Marxists, if they do not compromise themselves”. 
 No one in the world will be able to prevent the victory of the Communists over the Second and the Two-and-a-Half Internationals (and under the conditions prevailing in twentieth-century Western Europe and America, after the first imperialist war, this means victoryover the bourgeoisie) unless the Communists prevent it themselves. 
 Exaggeration, however slight, means preventing victory. 
Exaggeration of the struggle against Centrism means saving Centrism, means strengthening its position, its in-fluence over the workers. 
 In the period between the Second and the Third Congresses, we learned to wage a victorious struggle againstCentrism on an international scale. 
 This is proved by thefacts. 
 We will continue to wage this struggle (expulsion of Levi and of Serrati’s party) to the end. 
 We have, however, not yet learned, on an international scale, to combat wrong exaggerations in the struggle againstCentrism. 
 But we have become conscious of this defect, ashas been proved by the course and outcome of the ThirdCongress. 
 And precisely because we have become conscious of our defect we will rid ourselves of it . 
 And then we shall be invincible, because without support inside the proletariat (through the medium of the bourgeoisagents of the Second and the Two-and-a-Half Internationals)the bourgeoisie in Western Europe and America cannot retain power. 
 More careful, more thorough preparation for fresh and more decisive battles, both defensive and offensive—thatis the fundamental and principal thing in the decisionsof the Third Congress. 
 “...Communism will become a mass force in Italy if the Italian Communist Party unceasingly and steadily fights the opportunistpolicy of Serratism and at the same time is able to maintain closecontact with the proletarian masses in the trade unions, duringstrikes, during clashes with the counter-revolutionary fascist organi-sations; if it is able to merge the movements of all the working-class organisations and to transform the spontaneous outbreaks of theworking class into carefully prepared battles.... 
” “The United Communist Party of Germany will be the better able to carry out mass action, the better it adapts its fighting slogansto the actual situation in future, the more thoroughly it studies the situation, and the more co-ordinated and disciplined the action it conducts.... 
” Such are the most pertinent passages of the tactical resolution of the Third Congress. 
 To win over the majority of the proletariat to our side— such is the “principal task” (the heading of Point 3 of theresolution on tactics). 
 Of course, we do not give the winning of the majority a formal interpretation, as do the knights of philistine“democracy” of the Two-and-a-Half International. 
 When in Rome, in July 1921, the entire proletariat—the reformist proletariat of the trade unions and the Centrists of Serrati’sparty— followed the Communists against the fascists, that was winning over the majority of the working class to our side. 
 This was far, very far, from winning them decisively; it was doing so only partially, only momentarily, only locally. 
 But it was winning over the majority, and that is possibleeven if, formally, the majority of the proletariat followbourgeois leaders, or leaders who pursue a bourgeois policy(as do all the leaders of the Second and the Two-and-a-HalfInternationals), or if the majority of the proletariat are wavering. 
 This winning over is gaining ground steadily in every way throughout the world. 
 Let us make more thoroughand careful preparations for it; let us not allow a singleserious opportunity to slip by when the bourgeoisie compelsthe proletariat to undertake a struggle; let us learn tocorrectly determine the moment when the masses of the proletariat cannot but rise together with us. 
 Then victory will be assured, no matter how severe some of the defeats and transitions in our great campaign may be. 
 Our tactical and strategic methods (if we take them on an international scale) still lag behind the excellent strategyof the bourgeoisie, which has learned from the example of Russia and will not let itself be “taken by surprise”. 
 But our forces are greater, immeasurably greater; we are learn-ing tactics and strategy; we have advanced this “science”on the basis of the mistakes of the March 1921 action. 
 Weshall completely master this “science”. 
 In the overwhelming majority of countries, our parties are still very far from being what real Communist Parties should be; they are far from being real vanguards of thegenuinely revolutionary and only revolutionary class, with every single member taking part in the struggle, in the movement, in the everyday life of the masses. 
 But we are aware of this defect, we brought it out most strikingly in the Third Congress resolution on the work of theParty. 
 And we shall overcome this defect. 
 Comrades, German Communists, permit me to conclude by expressing the wish that your party congress on August22 will with a firm hand put a stop once and for all to the trivial struggle against those who have broken away on the left and the right. 
 Inner-party struggles must stop!Down with everyone who wants to drag them out, directlyor indirectly. 
 We know our tasks today much more clearly,concretely and thoroughly than we did yesterday; we arenot afraid of pointing openly to our mistakes in order to rectify them. 
 We shall now devote all the Party’s efforts to improving its organisation, to enriching the qualityand content of its work, to creating closer contact with themasses, and to working out increasingly correct and accurateworking-class tactics and strategy. 
 With communist greetings, N. 
 Lenin August 14, 1921 Published in 1921 Published according to the manuscript N O T E S 1 2Lenin’s first speech to Party activists in the discussion of the role and tasks of the trade unions in socialist construction was delivered at the Bolshoi Theatre on December 30, 1920. 
 Trotsky had started the discussion in the Communist group of the Fifth All-Russia Trade Union Conference on November 3 with his call “to tighten the screws of War Communism” as opposed to the Party’s line to stimulate democratic activity in the trade unions. 
 The disagreements turned “on the different approach to the mass, the way of winning it over, and keeping in touch with it” (Lenin ). 
 The disagreements in the group were brought before the Central Committee Plenary Meeting. 
 But Trotsky’s December 24 speech before the delegates of the Eighth All-Russia Congress of Soviets and trade union activists carried the issue outside the Central Committee. 
 On December 25, he published a pamphlet, which marked the formation of an anti-Party faction, and served as a signal for action by other anti-Party groups—“buffer”, “Workers’ Opposition”, “Democratic Centralism”, etc. 
 Lenin was against any discussion, realising that it distracted the Party’s attention and forces from the immediate tasks of fighting the economic dislocation and the famine. 
 But when the anti-Party groups came out, he attacked them, concentrating on the Trotskyites as the chief anti-Party force. 
 In his speeches and articles— The Party Crisis and Once Again on the Trade Unions, the Current Situation and the Mistakes of Trotsky and Bukharin — Lenin showed the essence of the internal Party struggle and ex-posed the factional activity of the opposition groups, which tended to disrupt the Party’s unity, and the great harm of the discussion imposed on it. 
 He put forward and developed a number of impor-tant principles underlying the trade unions’ role in the dictator-ship of the proletariat and their tasks in socialist construction. 
 The discussion lasted more than two months. 
 The overwhelm-ing majority of the Party organisations approved Lenin’s plat-form and rejected the opposition’s. 
 The results of the discussion were summed up at the Tenth Congress of the Party on March 8-16, 1921. 
 p. 
 19 On its agenda were the current tasks of economic construction and the question of the trade union movement. 
 It defined the short-term economic tasks and stressed the need for the trade unions’ active participation in socialist construction. 
 It adopted the following resolutions: “The Current Tasks of Economic Con-struction” and “The Trade Unions and Their Organisation”.

 p. 
 22 The reference is to the Eighth All-Russia Congress of Soviets of Workers’, Peasants’, Red Army and Cossack Deputies held in Moscow on December 22-29, 1920. 
 It was attended by 2,537 delegates, the greatest number ever.

 Of the total number of delegates 91.

 It showed the growing authority of the Communist Party and the political bankruptcy of the petty-bourgeois parties, which had betrayed themselves as anti-Soviet and counter-revolutionary. 
 The Congress met at a time when the war against the foreign intervention and internal counter-revolution was coming to a victorious end, and when the economic front stood out as “the main and most important one” ( Lenin ). 
 On its agenda there were the following questions, the chief of which had been discussed beforehand by the Communist group: report on the activity of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee and the Council of People’s Commissars, electrification of Russia; rehabilitation of industry and transport; development of agricultural production and promotion of farming; efficiency of Soviet establishments and the struggle against bureaucratic practices. 
 These problems were thrashed out in three sections: industry, agriculture and Soviet administration. 
 Lenin guided the work of the Congress. 
 At the plenary meeting on December 22, he gave a report on the activity of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee and the Council of People’s Commissars, and on December 23, he summed up the debate. 
 He spoke six times at the Communist group meetings on December 21, 22, 24 and 27 on the question of concessions and the draft law on measures to consolidate and develop peasant farming. 
 By an overwhelming majority, the Congress adopted a resolu-tion on Lenin’s report, approving the government’s activity, and rejected a draft resolution motioned by the petty-bour-geois delegates, who had delivered anti-Soviet speeches. 
 The Congress adopted a plan for the electrification of the coun-try (GOELRO), worked out on Lenin’s initiative and instruc-tions. 
 This was the first long-range economic plan of the Soviet state and Lenin called it “the second Party Programme”. 
 He also wrote the resolution on Krzhizhanovsky’s report. 
 Another major question on the agenda was a draft law on measures to consolidate and develop peasant farming, which had been adopted by the Council of People’s Commissars on December3 4 5 6 7which hundreds of decrees and bills of the Soviet power were grouped”. 
 Lenin took part in the discussion of its principal clauses by the non-Party peasant delegates to the Congress at a special meeting on December 22, and by the Communist group on December 24 and 27. 
 The draft law was adopted unanimously. 
 The Congress passed a comprehensive resolution to improve and reorganise the entire Soviet apparatus as required by the transition to peaceful economic construction. 
 It regulated rela-tions between central and local organs of power and administra-tion. 
 The Congress also discussed the reorganisation of the whole system of economic management in accordance with the new economic tasks, and approved a new statute of the Council of Labour and Defence. 
 It instituted the Order of the Red Banner of Labour as an award for dedication, initiative, efficiency and hard work in solving economic tasks.

 They tried to reconcile Leninism and Trotskyism, acting as a “buffer” in disagreements on the question of the role and tasks of the trade unions. 
 In fact Bukharin attacked Lenin and defended Trotsky. 
 They did much harm to the Party by supporting the worst kind of factional activity. 
 Lenin said Bukharin’s theses were a “low in ideological disintegration”. 
 Bukharin soon aban-doned his platform and openly sided with Trotsky. 
 Lenin characterised the “buffer” group and its anti-Party views in his article, “The Party Crisis”, in the pamphlet, Once Again on the Trade Unions , the Current Situation and the Mistakes of Trotsky and Bukharin , and elsewhere. 
 p. 
 27 The Council of Workers ’ and Peasants ’ Defence was set up by the All-Russia Central Executive Committee on November 30, 1918, to implement its September 2, 1918 decree which pro-8 9its Chairman. 
 It was vested with extraordinary powers in mo-bilising the resources of the Soviet state for defence in that exceptionally difficult period. 
 The Council was the Republic’s chief military-economic and planning centre during the intervention and Civil War and also controlled the activity of the Revolutionary Military Council and other military organs. 
 Its decrees were binding on all Soviet citizens, as well as on central and local agencies. 
 Early in April 1920, it was reorganised into the Council of Labour and Defence (C. 
L. 
D. 
) ( Soviet Truda i Oborony —STO), and under a decision of the Eighth All-Russia Congress of Soviets in December 1920 it began to operate as a government commission responsible for co-ordinating the work of all economic departments. 
 It was abolished in 1937. 
 p. 
 28 Glavpolitput —the Chief Political Department of the People’s Commissariat for Communications—was formed as a provisional organ under the direct leadership of the Party’s Central Committee in February 1919, and in January 1920 it was renamed the Chief Political Administration. 
 It took extraordinary measures to reha-bilitate the railways that had been ruined in the imperialist war and the Civil War, to improve Party and political work among railway workers, and to strengthen and stimulate the activity of the railwaymen’s trade union and make it an instrument for the further development of the railways. 
 It introduced military discipline on the railways to gear them to the war effort. 
 Themeasures effected by Glavpolitput saved the railways from utter ruin, but produced bureaucratic and undemocratic practices in the trade unions and a tendency to lose touch with the masses. 
 It was abolished by a Central Committee decision on Decem-ber 7, 1920, at the end of the Civil War and the start of peaceful development. 
 p. 
 34 Tsektran —the Central Committee of the Joint Trade Union of Rail and Water Transport Workers. 
 In September 1920, the two unions were merged to set up a strong centralised administration capable of tackling the tasks of rapidly rehabilitating transport, whose stoppages tended to paralyse the national economy. 
 Its extraordinary powers and military methods of work, which sprang from the enormity of the tasks before it, bred bureaucratic prac-tices, the appointments system, administration by injunction, etc. 
 It fell into the hands of the Trotskyites, who set the workers against the Party and split their unity. 
 The plenary meetings of the C. 
C. 
 on November 8 and December 7, 1920, condemned Tsektran’s methods and adopted a decision to incorporate it into the general system of the All-Russia Central Council of Trade Unions on a par with other unions. 
 Tsektran was advised to change its methods, develop trade union democracy, make all trade union bodies elective, reduce the appointments system, etc. 
 The First All-Russia Congress of Transport Workers in March 1921 called by the Central Committee of the Party expelled the Trotskyites from the Tsektran leadership and outlined new methods of work. 
 p. 
 34 10 11 12Politvod —the Chief Political Administration of Water Trans-port of the People’s Commissariat for Communications—was set up in April 1920 as an agency of Glavpolitput to carry on political education among the workers and exercise political control over the technical and administrative personnel; to put water transport on its feet as soon as possible; to stimulate higher productivity and improve discipline. 
 It was dissolved in December 1920. 
 p. 
 35 The Party wanted the trade unions’ work reorganised in accord-ance with the tasks of peaceful socialist construction, democracy developed and military methods of administration abolished. 
 This was opposed by Trotsky, who demanded, at the Communist group meeting on November 3, a “shake-up” of the trade unions. 
 He wanted “the screws tightened” and the trade unions govern-mentalised immediately. 
 He disagreed on the “approach to the mass, the way of winning it over, and keeping in touch with it”. 
 His speech started the Party discussion on the trade unions, but the Communist delegates rejected his demands, for their realisation would have abolished the trade unions and under-mined the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
 That is why his theses were discussed by the Party Central Committee. 
 At the November 8 C. 
C. 
 Plenary Meeting, Lenin came out with his own theses which, when put to the vote, won 8 votes, as against 7 for Trotsky’s.

 Kollontai, I. 
 I. 
 Kutuzov, Y.

 Lutovinov, etc. 
 It first came out under its demagogic name at the Ninth All-Russia Conference of the R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
) in September 1920. 
 In November the group launched a factional struggle under-mining the unity of the Party and organised a special discussion at the Moscow Gubernia Conference of the R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
). 
 It took final shape as the Workers’ Opposition in 1920-21 during the discussion on the trade unions. 
 Its views constituted an anarcho-syndicalist deviation within the Party and were expounded in full in Kollontai’s pam-phlet, The Workers ’ Opposition , published on the eve of the Tenth Party Congress, proposing that the national economy should be run by an All-Russia Congress of Producers organised in industrial trade unions. 
 It wanted all economic bodies to be elected by the trade unions, with Party and Soviet organs having no power to reject the candidates nominated by the trade unions. 
 It denied that the Party had the leading role to play in socialist construction and that the dictatorship of the proletariat was the Party’s chief instrument. 
 It said it was not the Party but the trade unions that were the highest form of workers’ organisation. 
 The Workers’ Opposition had some temporary support among workers swayed by petty-bourgeois influence and tried to use their vacillation to promote its narrow interests. 
 It also had some sym-pathisers in central and local Party organisations. 
 Thus, its platform won 21 per cent of the vote at the Moscow Gubernia Party 13Conference in November 1920; 30 per cent at the Communist group meeting of the Second All-Russia Congress of Miners in early 1921, but less than 6 per cent at the Tenth Party Congress. 
 The Congress completely defeated the Workers’ Opposition; this was the result of the Party’s educational work exposing the Opposition’s demagogic anti-Party views. 
 It lost ground among the rank and file and was heavily defeated at the Tenth Congress. 
 Lenin’s resolution, “On the Syndicalist and Anarchist Deviation in our Party”, stressed that the views of the Workers’ Opposition were wrong theoretically and “tended to weaken the Communist Party’s consistent general line, actually helping the class enemy of the proletarian revolution”.

 The Congress decided that the propaganda of the Workers’ Opposition ideas was incompatible with membership in the Party. 
 Its resolution on the Party’s unity demanded the immediate dissolution of all anti-Party groups, whatever their platforms. 
 Most rank-and-file members of the Opposition broke with the group and gave sincere support to the Party’s line. 
 But Shlyapnikov and Medvedyev headed the remnants in an illegal organisation which continued to conduct anti-Party propaganda behind a facade of ultra-revolutionary phrases. 
 In February 1922, they sent to the Executive Committee of the Comintern their “Declaration of 22”, a slanderous attack on the Party. 
 The Executive Committee studied the “Declaration”, condemned the group, and warned that any further activity on their part would put them outside the Third International. 
 Their organisational defeat was completed by the Party’s Eleventh Congress in 1922. 
 p. 
 46 At a joint meeting of the Party groups of the Eighth Congressof Soviets, the All-Russia Central Council of Trade Unions and the Moscow City Council of Trade Unions, an argu-ment took place as to whether Y. 
 E. 
 Rudzutak was the author of the theses, The Tasks of the Trade Unions in Production . 
 Lenin asked the Trade Union Central Council for documents on theorigin of the theses. 
 He was given an extract from record No. 
 44 of the minutes of November 1, and a covering note from S. 
 A. 
 Lozovsky. 
 The extract proved that the Presidium had dis-cussed and adopted Rudzutak’s theses as a basis and had instruct-ed M. 
 P. 
 Tomsky and Rudzutak to put finishing touches to the theses. 
 The note said this was done by Rudzutak alone. 
 The Fifth All-Russia Conference of Trade Unions heard Rudzutak’s report, adopted his theses as a basis and elected a commission, con-sisting of G. 
 V. 
 Tsiperovich, A. 
 A. 
 Andreyev and Rudzutak, to edit them. 
 They worked out several points and amplified the theses. 
 Lenin sent the documents and Rudzutak’s theses to Pravda with his covering letter, which said: “I request the Editorial Board to publish Rudzutak’s theses, which were adopted by the Fifth All-Russia Trade Union Conference of November 2-6, 1920, 14 15 16and are indispensable to the discussion. 
 I enclose additional material on the disagreements in Party circles concerning the origin of these theses. 
” The documents and Lenin’s letter were published in Pravda No. 
 13 on January 21, 1921. 
 p. 
 47 The “Appeal to the Party” was adopted at a discussion meeting of the representatives of Petrograd district Party organisations on January 3, 1921. 
 On January 6, it was approved by a city meeting in People’s House which was attended by over 4,000 Party members and candidates. 
 Only 20 votes were cast against it. 
 When it was discussed in the district Party organisations it had the support of 95-98 per cent of the membership. 
 The Petrograd Bolsheviks supported Lenin and opposed Trotsky on the question of the trade unions’ role and tasks. 
 They called the other Party organisations to follow Lenin and stressed the danger of Trotsky’s platform, for its realisation would have abolished the trade unions and undermined the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
 Pravda No. 
 7 of January 13 published the Appeal and also the counter-statement of the Moscow Party Committee, which at that time took a “buffer” stand. 
 In a resolution published in the same issue of Pravda the Moscow Committee said that it found “it absolutely impossible” to accept the Petrograd propos-als; it said the Petrograd Party organisation’s stand showed its “extremely dangerous” tendency to become a special centre for preparing the Party Congress; it did not condemn Trotsky’s establishment of a faction, thereby giving support to his anti-Party struggle.

C. 
P. 
 on the Role and Tasks of the Trade Unions was Lenin’s “Platform of 10” tabled before the Central Committee by a group of members of the C. 
C. 
 and of the Central Committee’s Trade Union Commis-sion in opposition to the platforms of the anti-Party groups. 
 It defined the role of the trade unions in the light of the new tasks connected with the end of the Civil War and transition to peaceful socialist construction: the trade unions, being a school of administration, a school of economic management, a school of com-munism, were chiefly to take part in government, train personnel for government bodies and economic agencies, and help tighten labour discipline. 
 They were to base their work on education, persuasion and democratic practices. 
 The Tenth Congress’s resolution on the role and tasks of the trade unions was based on the “Platform of 10”, which during the discussion had been supported by a majority of local Party organisations.

 They first came out against Lenin’s line in Party and Soviet organisation at the Eighth Party Congress. 
 At the Ninth Congress, they had their own rapporteurs on economic construction and organisational problems, but failed 17 18to find any support among the Bolsheviks. 
 On many questions they had backing only from the Mensheviks. 
 They denied the Party’s leading role in the Soviets and trade unions and demanded freedom of factions and groups, and a merger of the Council of People’s Commissars and the Presidium of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee, they opposed thesubordination of local to central organs and wanted the Organisa-tion Bureau of the Central Committee deprived of all say in po-litical leadership, which would have split up the C. 
C. 
’s politicaland organisational unity. 
 They opposed one-man management and the personal responsibility of managers in industry. 
 In the Ukraine, they were against the “Poor Peasants’ Committees”which were instruments of the proletariat’s dictatorship in thecountryside. 
 The group published its platform during the trade union dis-cussion in 1920-21, but at the pre-Congress meetings it won only a handful of votes. 
 At the Tenth Congress they withdrew their platform and allowed their members to vote freely. 
 They continuedto fight the Party on questions of organisation, on which V. 
 N. 
 Ma-ximovsky delivered a co-report. 
 After the Tenth Congress, onlythe leaders continued their anti-Party activity. 
 In 1923, theyjoined the Trotskyites, and in 1926, formed the “Group of 15” headed by Sapronov and Smirnov, which was expelled from the Party by the Fifteenth Party Congress. 
 p. 
 49 Ignatovites , or “a group of activists of Moscow city districts” was an anti-Party anarcho-syndicalist group, headed by Y. 
 N. 
 Ig-natov, during the trade union discussion of 1920-21. 
 Its activity was limited to the Moscow Party organisation, because it had no influence among the city’s workers and rank-and-file Partymembers. 
 Before the Tenth Party Congress, it came out with twoplatforms: the current tasks of the trade unions, and Party organi-sation. 
 The Ignatovites shared the anarcho-syndicalist views ofthe Workers’ Opposition; they set the trade unions in opposi-tion to the Soviet state; denied the Party’s leadership in socialist construction: opposed democratic centralism; demandedfreedom of discussions, and wanted the Party membership toconsist of workers only. 
 They also demanded the handover of theadministration of the economy to an organ elected by the All-Russia Trade Union Congress, but in contrast to the Workers’ Opposition, they wanted the organ confirmed by the All-Russia Central Executive Committee as well. 
 At the Tenth Congress,Ignatov was the official rapporteur of the Workers’ Opposition onproblems of Party organisation. 
 After the Congress, the groupbroke up. 
 p. 
 49 The reference is to the merger of the anti-Party Vperyod group (which consisted of otzovists, ultimatumists, and god-builders)with Menshevik liquidators and Trotskyites. 
 They united afterthe Sixth (Prague) All-Russia Conference of the Russian Social-19 20 21 22Democratic Labour Party to fight its decisions. 
 They led a mali-cious campaign against the Bolsheviks in an effort to split theworkers’ revolutionary movement and weaken the proletarianParty. 
 They formed a bloc demanding the “transformation” of the Party, which, in fact, implied its liquidation. 
 The bloc, which had no principles to hold it together, was unstable andsoon fell apart. 
 p. 
 51 The reference is to the trade union discussion at an enlarged ses-sion of the Moscow Party Committee together with delegates from Party organisations of Moscow city districts and uyezds on January 17, 1921. 
 The session debated all the draft theses put forward by various groups during the discussion. 
 In the preliminary voting,Lenin’s theses got 76 votes; Trotsky’s, 27; Bukharin’s, 5; Shlyap-nikov’s, 4; Sapronov’s, 11; Ignatov’s, 25; Nogin’s, none, and Ryazanov’s, none. 
 In the re-vote on the two main platforms, 84 votes were cast for Lenin’s theses, and 27, for Trotsky’s. 
 On January 18, the Moscow Party Committee adopted an appeal “To All Party Organisations” asking all Party membersto give unanimous support to Lenin’s platform. 
 p. 
 51 The Congress was held in Moscow’s Trade Union House from January 25 to February 2, 1921. 
 It was attended by 341 delegates,of whom 295 had voice and vote, and 46, voice only. 
 Theyrepresented more than 332,000 members of the Miners’ Trade The items on its agenda were: report of the Miners’ Trade Union Central Committee; reports of the Mining Council and its departments; fuel supply problems; tasks of the trade union; organisation of production; wage rates; organisation; culturaland educational work; labour safety measures; international ties;concessions, and election of a new Trade Union Central Commit-tee. 
 The Congress decided to issue an appeal for unity to theorganised workers of all countries. 
 Prior to the Congress, on January 22-24, the R.

 Theabsolute majority of the group supported Lenin’s platform, whichwon 137 votes; Shlyapnikov’s received 61, and Trotsky’s, 8. 
 The Congress helped to solve the fuel crisis and work out pro-duction programmes for the mining industry.

 p. 
 62 The reference is to the Eighteenth Congress of the French Social-ist Party in Tours, December 25-30, 1920. 
 It was attended by 23285 delegates with 4,575 mandates. 
 The main question on the agenda was the Party’s affiliation to the Communist International. 
 The issue was a foregone conclusion because at the federation congresses held before the national Congress, an absolute major-ity had voted for immediate entry into the Third International on the basis of the 21 conditions. 
 Still there was a bitter struggle at the Congress between supporters of affiliation (Paul Vaillant-Couturier, Marcel Cachin, Daniel Renoult) and its opponents (Léon Blum, Jean Longuet, Marcel Sembat and others). 
 Clara Zetkin, who had come to the Congress in spite of the French Government’s ban and police harassment, delivered a brilliant speech and conveyed greetings on behalf of the Communist International. 
 After a four-day debate, the delegates voted for affiliation by 3,208 mandates, or more than 70 per cent. 
 The majority set up the Communist Party of France, which was finally formed in May 1921. 
 The minority, led by Léon Blum, aimed at splitting the workers’ movement, and walked out of the Congress, forming their own reformist party, which retained the old name of the French Socialist Party. 
 p. 
 62 The Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection (Rabkrin) was set up in February 1920 on Lenin’s initiative, on the basis of the reorganised People’s Commissariat for State Control which had been formed in the early months of the Soviet power. 
 Lenin attached great importance to control and verification from top to bottom. 
 He worked out in detail the principles of organising control in the Soviet state, kept an eye on Rabkrin’s activity, criticised its shortcomings and did his best to make it more efficient. 
 In his last articles, “How We Should Reorganise the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection” and “Better Fewer but Better”, Lenin outlined a plan for reorganising Rabkrin. 
 To merge Party and state control and to enlist more workers and peasants in its activity were the basic principles of Lenin’s plan, and this he regarded as the source of the Party’s and the state’s inexhaus-tible strength. 
 On Lenin’s instructions, the Party’s Twelfth Congress set up a joint organ, the Central Control Commission and the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection, to exercise Party and state control. 
 During Stalin’s personality cult, these principles were violated, and Lenin’s system of control was substituted by a bureaucratic apparatus. 
 In 1934, Stalin secured a decision to set up two control centres—the Central Committee’s Party Control Com-mission, and the Government’s Soviet Control Commission. 
 The People’s Commissariat for State Control of the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
 was set up in 1940; it was reorganised into the Ministry for State Control in 1946, and later, into the Commission for State Control. 
 Pur-suant to a decision of the Twenty-Second Congress, which stressed the importance of Party, state and mass control, the November 1962 Central Committee Plenary Meeting deemed it necessary to reorganise the system of control on Leninist principles.

 5, 1920. 
 It ran: “A great change is about to occur in the life of water transport: primitive methods, committee treadmill, hap-hazard work and anarchy are on the way out. 
 Water transport is becoming a state enterprise, headed by political commissars with appropriate powers. 
 Committees, trade unions and elected delegates will no longer have the power to interfere in technical and administrative matters. 
” The order was an example of administration by injunction and bureaucratic practices, which Tsektran’s Trotskyite leader-ship was introducing, and was evidence of their misunderstanding of the trade unions’ role in getting transport back on its feet. 
 The trade unions were equated with outdated army committees, and barred by order from taking part in improving water transport operations. 
 p. 
 79 On December 24, 1920, in what used to be the Zimin theatre, Trotsky gave a report on the trade unions tasks in production at a joint meeting of trade union activists and delegates to the Eighth All-Russia Congress of Soviets, called by the Central Committee of the Joint Union of Rail and Water Transport Work-ers. 
 It started the open Party discussion on the trade unions. 
 p.

 In view of the acute food crisis, the main reports dealt with the food situation and the working-class atti-tude to the peasantry. 
 Wage rates and the trade unions’ role in production were also discussed.

 The Polish Government, instigated by France, continued its aggressive acts against the Soviet Ukraine and Soviet Byelorussia and hampered the peace conference in every way. 
 Decisive diplomatic action by the Soviet Government and the defeat of Wrangel, who was an ally of bourgeois-landowner Poland, com-pelled the Polish Government to conclude peace. 
 The final peace treaty was signed in Riga on March 18, 1921, under which Western Ukraine and Western Byelorussia were ceded to Poland.

 156 The Tenth Party Congress was held in Moscow on March 8-16, 1921. 
 It was attended by 694 delegates with voice and vote and 296 with voice only. 
 They represented 732,521 Party members. 
 The items on the agenda were: 1) Report of the Central Committee; 2) Report of the Control Commission; 3) The trade unions’ eco-nomic role; 4) The Socialist Republic in a capitalist encirclement, foreign trade, concessions, etc. 
; 5) Food supply, surplus-food appropriation, tax in kind and fuel crisis; 6) Problems of Party organisation; 7) The Party’s current tasks in the nationalities question; 8) Reorganisation of the army and the militia question; 9) The Chief Administration for Political Education and the Party’s propaganda and agitation work; 10) Report of the R.

C. 
P. 
’s representatives in the International Trade Union Council; 12) Elections to the Central Committee, the Control Commission and the Auditing Commission. 
 The Congress resolu-tions dealt with the key political and economic problems. 
 Lenin guided the entire work of the Congress: he delivered the opening and closing speeches and gave reports on the political activity of the C. 
C. 
, the substitution of a tax in kind for the sur-plus appropriation system, the Party’s unity and the anarcho-syndicalist deviation, the trade unions and the fuel crisis. 
 He drafted the main resolutions. 
 He gave a profound theoretical and political substantiation of the necessity of transition from War Communism to the New Economic Policy (NEP). 
 The Congress adopted historic decisions on the substitution of a tax in kind for the surplus appropriation system, and the transition to NEP, which was designed to draw millions of peasants into socialist construction. 
 The Congress paid special attention to the Party’s unity. 
 Lenin exposed and sharply criticised the anti-Marxist views of the opposition groups. 
 The resolution “On Party Unity” adopted on Lenin’s motion ordered the immediate dissolution of all fac-tions and groups which tended to weaken the Party’s unity. 
 The Congress authorised the Central Committee to apply, as an extreme measure, expulsion from the Party to C. 
C. 
 members who engaged in factional activity. 
 The Congress also adopted Lenin’s draft resolution “On the Syndicalist and Anarchist Deviation in our Party”, which exposed the views of the Workers’ Opposition as an expression of petty-bourgeois, anarchist vacillations. 
 The propaganda of anarcho-syndicalist ideas was found to be incompatible with membership in the Party. 
 With the country engaged in peaceful socialist construction, the Congress came down in favour of broader demo-cracy within the Party. 
 The Congress summed up the discussion on the trade unions’ role in economic development, condemned the ideas of the Trotskyites, the Workers’ Opposition, the Democratic Centralism group and other opportunist trends, and approved Lenin’s platform by an overwhelming majority, terming the trade unions as a school of communism, and suggesting measures to develop trade union democracy. 
 A commission headed by Lenin worked out the Congress’s decisions on the Party’s nationalities policy in the new conditions: to eliminate the actual inequality of peoples which had been oppressed in tsarist Russia, and draw them into socialist construc-tion. 
 The Congress condemned the anti-Party deviations on the na-tionalities question, great-power chauvinism and local nationalism, which were a grave danger to communism and proletarian internationalism. 
 On the newly elected 25 -man Central Committee were Lenin, Artyom (F.

 The historic decisions of the Tenth Congress charted the ways of transition from capitalism to socialism, and methods of con-struction of socialism in the new conditions; they stressed the importance of greater unity between the proletariat and thepeasantry, and stronger Party leadership in the construction ofsocialism.

 165 The Second Congress, which laid the programme, tactical and organisational foundations of the Comintern, was held from July 19 to August 7, 1920. 
 It opened in Petrograd, but was transferredto Moscow on July 23. 
 More than 200 delegates representedCommunist Parties and workers’ organisations from 37 countries. 
 At the first sitting, Lenin gave a report on the international situation and the main tasks of the Comintern. 
 Later he made speeches on the Communist Party, the nationalities and colonial questions, parliamentarism and other questions. 
 He took partin the work of most of the commissions. 
 The Congress adopted Lenin’s 21 conditions of affiliation to the Communist International, which was of great importance forcreating and strengthening the new type of workers’ parties in the capitalist countries. 
 The ideas in Lenin’s classic Left-Wing Communism, an Infantile Disorder served as the basis of the Congress’s resolutions. 
 Lenin also took part in drafting a resolu-tion “On the Role of the Communist Party in the ProletarianRevolution”, which stressed that the Communist Party was theprincipal instrument in the liberation of the working class. 
 Lenin’s theses on the nationalities and colonial question and on the agrarian question were also adopted as resolutions. 
 The Congress stimulated the international communist move-ment. 
 Lenin said that after the Congress “communism has becomecentral to the working-class movement as a whole”. 
 p. 
 167 The Ninth Congress was held in Moscow from March 29 to April 5, 1920. 
 It was attended by 715 delegates, the greatest number ever,who represented 611,978 Party members. 
 Of them 553 had voiceand vote, and 162, voice only. 
 The delegates came from CentralRussia, the Ukraine, the Urals, Siberia and other areas justliberated by the Red Army. 
 Some delegates came straight from the front lines. 
 The country was having a short respite after the defeat of Kolchak and Denikin. 
 Items on the agenda were: 1) Report of the Central Committee; 2) Current tasks of economic construction; 3) Trade union move-ment; 4) Organisational questions; 5) Tasks of the CommunistInternational; 6) Attitude to co-operatives; 7) Transition to the militia system; 8) Election of the Central Committee; 9) Current business. 
 Lenin guided the work of the Congress. 
 He made a report on the Central Committee’s political activity and a summing-up speech;48 49 he spoke on economic construction and the co-operatives; he proposed a list of candidates for election to the Central Committee. 
He also delivered the closing speech of the Congress. 
 In the resolution, “The Current Tasks of Economic Construc-tion”, the Congress stated that “the main condition of the coun-try’s economic rehabilitation is the undeviating implementationof an integrated economic plan projected for the immediatehistorical period ahead”.

 Lenin considered its key item—electrification—to be a great programme for a period of 10 or 20 years. 
 The Congress’s directives served asthe basis for GOELRO (the Plan of the State Commission for theElectrification of Russia), which was completed and adoptedby the Eighth All-Russia Congress of Soviets in December 1920. 
 The Congress also dealt with industrial management. 
 The resolution on this question stressed the need to develop competent, firm and vigorous administration on the basis of one-manmanagement. 
 The anti-Party group of Democratic Centralism (T. 
 V. 
 Sapronov, N. 
 Osinsky [V. 
 V. 
 Obolensky], V. 
 M. 
 Smirnov) cameout against the Party’s line in economic construction, but its proposals were condemned and rejected by the Congress. 
 The Congress discussed and approved the idea of labour emulation and communist subbotniks . 
 The Congress discussed the trade unions’ activity in helping to fulfil the economic tasks. 
 It defined their role, their relation-ship with the Party and the state, the forms and methods of the Party’s leadership in the trade unions and their participation in economic construction. 
 At a closed session on April 4, the Congress elected 19 members and 12 alternate members of the new Central Committee. 
 p. 
 168 The reference is to the Party discussion of the trade unions’ role and tasks in socialist construction. 
 Lenin analysed these problems and criticised the anti-Party groups in his articles: The Trade Unions , The Present Situation and Trotsky ’s Mistakes ; The Party Crisis ; Once Again on the Trade Unions , The Current Situation and the Mistakes of Trotsky and Bukharin , and also in his speeches at the Second All-Russia Congress of Miners and at the Tenth Party Congress. 
 p. 
 168 The Soviet Government did its utmost to establish normal and good-neighbour relations with Poland. 
 In 1919, it offered peaceon many occasions, but received no answer from her bourgeois-landowner government, which continued in its hostile policy towards Soviet Russia. 
 On January 28, 1920, the Council of People’s Commissars of the R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
 sent the Polish Government and people a messagere-emphasising its recognition of Poland’s independence and50 51 sovereignty, and offering to make sizable territorial concessions to Poland. 
 On February 2, 1920, the All-Russia Central Executive Committee once again offered peace to the Polish people. 
 Their reactionary government was dependent on the imperialists of the Entente and considered the Soviet concessions a sign of weakness. 
 It was preparing for aggression against the Soviet Republic and the negotiations failed. 
 p. 
 171 The /FL00631 conditions for admission to the Comintern were adopted by its Second Congress on August 6, 1920. 
 Lenin worked out 19 of the conditions, which were published before the Congress. 
 He submitted the 20th to the Congress commission on July 25, 1920, and it was adopted. 
 The 21st condition ran: “Members of the Party who reject the obligations and theses of the Communist Interna-tional in principle should be expelled from the Party. 
 This also applies to delegates of extraordinary Party congresses. 
” p. 
 180 An international organisation set up at the Paris Peace Conference of victor powers in 1919. 
 The League’s working organs were its Assembly, Council and Permanent Secretariat headed by a secretary-general. 
 Its Covenant, a part of the Peace Treaty of Versailles, was signed by 44 states. 
 It was so couched as to create the impression that the League served the purposes of peace and security, worked for a reduction of armaments, and opposed aggression. 
 Actually, however, it pandered to the aggressors, and encouraged the arms drive and preparations for the Second World War. 
 From 1920 to 1934, the League’s activity was hostile to the Soviet state and in 1920 and 1921 the League was the organisa-tional centre of armed intervention against it. 
 On September 15, 1934, on the initiative of French diplomats, 34 member-states sent the Soviet Union an invitation to join the League. 
 In joining, the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
 tried to create a peace front, but the reactionary circles of the Western powers resisted its efforts. 
 When the war broke out, the League actually ceased to operate, although it was formally dissolved in April 1946, under a special Assembly decision.

 181 The counter-revolutionary mutiny in Kronstadt which began on February 28, 1921, was organised by the S. 
R. 
s, Mensheviks and whiteguards. 
 It involved newly recruited sailors, most of whom came from the countryside and were politically ignorant and discontented with the surplus appropriation system. 
 The mutiny was sparked off by the economic hardships and facilitated by the fact that the Kronstadt Bolshevik organisation was weakened. 
 The counter-revolutionary bourgeoisie did not dare come out against the Soviet power openly and used a new tactic. 
 In an52 53 54 55 attempt to deceive the people the leaders of the mutiny put forward the slogan “Soviets without the Bolsheviks”, hoping to drive out the Bolsheviks from the Soviets and re-establish capitalist rule in Russia. 
 On March 2, the mutineers arrested the fleet command and got in touch with foreign imperialists who promised them military and financial aid. 
 The events in Kronstadt were a threat to Petrograd. 
 Red Army units under M. 
 N. 
 Tukhachevsky and over 300 delegates of the Tenth Party Congress who had military experience, led by K. 
 Y. 
 Voroshilov, were sent to storm Kronstadt. 
 On March 18, the revolt was crushed.

 By August 1918, Komuch had, with the aid of Czechoslovak units, occupied some gubernias on the Volga and in the Urals area, but that autumn it was defeated by the Red Army and ceased to exist.

 Political Bureau, when N. 
 Osinsky gave a report on “The Sowing Campaign and the Condition of the Peasants”. 
 A special commission was set up to work out proposals for improving the peasants’ condition. 
 For this commission Lenin wrote the Rough Draft of Theses Concerning the Peasants and defined the main principles on which the tax in kind was to be substituted for surplus appropriation. 
 Under a Political Bureau decision of February 16, a discussion on the question was started in Pravda , the first articles appearing on February 17 and 26. 
 On February 24, a C. 
C. 
 Plenary Meeting approved a draft resolution on this question, which was then edited by a new com-mission. 
 On March 3, Lenin tabled three amendments to it. 
 On March 7, the C.

P. 
 (B.

 It was attended by 289 delegates with voice and vote, and 89, with voice only. 
 On its agenda were reports on the activity of the Moscow Party Com-mittee, the international and domestic situation and the Party’s tasks, the state of the country’s economy, and production propaganda. 
 The atmosphere at the Conference was very tense, because the Bolsheviks had to fight against the anti-Party groups of Demo-cratic Centralism, the Workers’ Opposition and the Ignatovites, who made demagogic attacks on the Party’s policy. 
 The Work-ers’ Opposition tried to get as many of their supporters on the Moscow Committee as possible and called a special meeting of worker delegates in the Mitrofanyevsky Hall of the Great Kremlin Palace, while the other delegates had a meeting in the Sverdlovsky Hall. 
 At the afternoon sitting on November 21, Lenin spoke on the international and domestic situation and the Party’s tasks, and later, on the elections to the Moscow Committee. 
 Led by Lenin, the Conference beat back the anti-Party attacks.

 195 The Ninth All-Russia Conference of the R. 
C. 
P. 
 (B. 
) was held in Moscow from September 22 to 25, 1920. 
 Its 241 delegates (116 with voice and vote, and 125, with voice only) represented 700,000 Party members. 
 On its agenda were: 1) Report by a representative of the Polish Communists; 2) Political report of the C. 
C. 
; 3) Or-ganisational report of the C. 
C. 
; 4) The current tasks of Party organisation; 5) Report of a commission on the study of the history of the Party; 6) Report on the Second Congress of the Comintern. 
 At the first sitting Lenin gave the political report of the Central Committee, dealing mainly with peace negotiations with Poland and preparations for defeating Wrangel. 
 The Conference adopted a unanimous resolution on the terms of a peace treaty with Poland. 
 Having discussed the current tasks of Party organisation, the Conference rejected the views of the Democratic Centralism group, which tried to discredit the one-man management system in industry, and to oppose Party discipline and the Party’s leading role in the Soviets and trade unions. 
 A resolution, “The Current Tasks of Party Organisation”, motioned by Lenin, outlined some measures for strengthening the Party and its leading role in the Soviet state, and developing inner-Party democracy, and also measures against the excesses of bureaucracy in Soviet administrative bodies and economic agencies. 
 The Conference deemed it necessary to set up a Control Commission alongside the Central Committee, and special Party commissions under gubernia committees, to combat various abuses and to inquire into complaints filed by Communists. 
 p. 
 19559 60 The Second Congress of Miners was held in Moscow’s Trade Union House from January 25 to February 2, 1921. 
 Its 295 delegates with voice and vote, and 46 with voice only, represented over 332,000 members of the Miners’ Trade Union. 
 Lenin and Kalinin were elected Honorary Chairmen. 
 The Congress heard and discussed a report of the Minors’ Trade Union Central Committee and reports of the Mining Council and its chief administrations; discussed fuel supply, organisation of production and other problems. 
 From January 22 to 24, the R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
) group had four meet-ings to discuss the trade unions’ role and tasks. 
 Lenin gave a report on January 23 and the absolute majority of the group voted for his platform. 
 The Congress helped to mobilise the people to combat the fuel crisis and to work out production programmes for the mining industry. 
 Lenin is quoting a speech by a Siberian delegate from Kollontai’s pamphlet, The Workers ’ Opposition (Moscow, 1921). 
 The text quoted by Kollontai is not in the report of the Siberian delegate as it is given in the Minutes of the Second Congress of Miners. 
 p.

 p. 
 199 The reference is to the Kharkov non-Party City Conference on March 5-6, 1921, on the food problem. 
 It was attended by about 2,000 delegates. 
 Left Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks sharply criticised the activity of economic and food supply bodies, but the Conference did not support their resolution. 
 On the report of the Chairman of the Kharkov Gubernia Executive Committee it adopted a resolution mapping out concrete measures to improve the workers’ food supplies. 
 p. 
 204 The reference is to the anti-Soviet documents of the Kronstadt mutineers: a resolution of a general meeting of the battleships’ 1st and 2nd brigades on March 1, and the provisional committee’s appeal, “To the Population of the Fortress and the Town of Kronstadt”, issued on March 2, 1921. 
 p. 
 204 The Conference was held in Moscow from November 2 to 6, 1920, and was attended by 202 delegates with voice and vote, and 59, with voice only. 
 The tasks of peaceful socialist construction demanded a reorganisation of trade union activity on the basis of greater democratisation, and this was opposed by Trotsky. 
 At the Communist group meeting on November 3, he demanded the immediate “governmentalisation” of the trade unions, and the introduction of military methods of command and administra-tion. 
 His speech started the Party discussion on the trade unions, but his demands were rejected by the Communist delegates. 
61 62 63 64 65 Y. 
 E. 
 Rudzutak gave a report on the trade unions’ tasks in industry. 
 The Conference adopted his theses, which were based on Lenin’s ideas that it was necessary to enhance the role of the trade unions in industry, develop democratic principles in their work, and strengthen the Party’s leadership in the trade union movement. 
 These ideas were later developed in the resolution, “The Role and Tasks of the Trade Unions”, adopted by the Tenth Party Congress.

 268 The Congress was held, under a decision of the Central Committee, in Moscow from March 22 to 31, 1921. 
 Most of its 1,079 delegates were Communists. 
 The items on the agenda were: report of Tsek-tran; report of the People’s Commissar for Communications; report of the Central Board of the River Transport Workers section; wage rates; transport workers’ food supplies, and international confederation of transport workers. 
 Lenin was elected Honorary Chairman of the Congress. 
 On the eve of the Congress, on March 25, 1921, Lenin had a talk with V. 
 V. 
 Fomin, Deputy Commissar for Communications, about the work of the Congress and the composition of the next Tsektran. 
 Lenin’s speech at the March 27 afternoon sitting was published as a pamphlet in 1921.

 285 The meeting was called by the Moscow Party Committee to explain the decisions of the Tenth Party Congress. 
 It took place at Trade Union House, and was also attended by the Moscow Bolshe-viks who had taken part in liquidating the Kronstadt counter-revo-lutionary mutiny, and the volost activists working among Moscow Gubernia peasant women. 
 The report on the tax in kind was given by Lenin. 
 p. 
 286 The Poor Peasants ’ Committees were set up under the June 11, 1918 decree of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee, “On the Organisation and Supply of Poor Peasants”. 
 They were to take stock of the food stored on peasant farms; to uncover surplus food on kulak farms, and to help the Soviet food supply bodies in requisitioning such surpluses and distributing them among the poor peasants. 
 They were also to distribute farming machines, manufactured goods, etc. 
 The committees actually became organs of the proletarian dictatorship in the villages. 
 Their activity embraced all spheres of work and signified the further development of the socialist revolution in the countryside. 
 At the end of 1918, after they had fulfilled their tasks, the committees were merged with volost and village Soviets. 
 In the Ukraine, they existed from 1920 to 1933, uniting land-starved and landless peasants. 
 p. 
 295 The Peace Treaty of Brest-Litovsk between Soviet Russia and the powers of the Quadruple Alliance (Germany, Austria-Hun-gary, Bulgaria and Turkey) was signed in Brest-Litovsk on March 3, 1918, and ratified by the Extraordinary Fourth All-Russia Congress of Soviets on March 15. 
 The terms of the treaty were ex-tremely onerous for Soviet Russia: Germany and Austria-Hungary secured almost complete control over Poland, nearly the whole of the Baltic area, and a part of Byelorussia; the Ukraine seceded from Soviet Russia and became a German dependency; the cities of Kars, Batum and Ardagan were ceded to Turkey. 
 In August 1918, Germany made Soviet Russia sign a supplementary treaty and a financial agreement whose terms were even more onerous. 
 The Brest Treaty was signed as a result of a great effort on Lenin’s part, who had to fight Trotsky and the anti-Party “Left Communist” group. 
 His wise and flexible tactics in extremely complicated conditions yielded the only correct policy: the Brest peace was a reasonable political compromise, which gave89 90 91 92 the Soviet state a respite and an opportunity to demobilise the old disintegrating army and to create a new one—the Red Army. 
 It allowed the country to get on with socialist construction and to build up resources for the coming struggle against internal coun-ter-revolution and foreign intervention. 
 This policy generated peaceful sentiments and promoted the growth of the revolution-ary mood in the armies and the population of all the belligerent countries. 
 After the November 1918 revolution in Germany over-threw the monarchy, the Brest Treaty was annulled by the All-Russia Central Executive Committee on November 13. 
 p. 
 295 The conference was held in Moscow on April 5-7, 1921, as a preliminary to the All-Russia Congress of Women of the East. 
 It was attended by 45 Communist delegates from Turkestan, Azer-baijan, Bashkiria, the Crimea, the Caucasus, Tataria, Siberia and some gubernias with a Turkic and mountaineer population. 
 It discussed the economic and juridical status of women in the East, their organisation, and agitation and propaganda among them. 
 The delegates sent Lenin an invitation to attend the con-ference, and in reply received the telegram in question. 
 They sent him another message of greetings at the close of the conference.

 Lenin gave a report on the issue, argued against Shlyapnikov’s and Ryazanov’s statements in the debate and made notes of all the arguments, which he used in his summing-up speech. 
 He defined the essence of the concessions policy and its importance for the Soviet state.

 In some places there were armed clashes with the police. 
 The workers of Berlin, Hamburg and several other towns expressed their solidarity with the heroic strikers, but the Communist Party of Germany failed to unite the working-class forces against the bourgeoisie because of the treach-erous behaviour of Paul Levi and other opportunists in the party leadership. 
 The miners’ strike in Britain lasted from April until June 1921, in protest of the mineowners’ intention to cut wages. 
 More than a million workers participated in the strike, with all the miners taking part. 
 The miners’ federation called on the execu-tive committees of the transport and railway unions to strike in solidarity, but their reformist leaders were secretly negotiating with the government and the mineowners for a compromise to break up the strike. 
 The miners had to return to work after a heroic three-month struggle. 
 p. 
 307 The conference (April 10-20, 1921) was attended by over 1,000 delegates from Petrograd factories and plants. 
 It discussed the following questions: 1) The tasks of the working class and its participation in the economic construction of Soviet Russia; 2) Workers’ living conditions in connection with the tasks of organising production; 3) Problems of food and workers’ supply. 
 The Mensheviks who got in as non-party workers did not succeedin disrupting the meeting because the mass of workers expressed a desire to work with the Communist Party. 
 The delegates sent their greetings to Lenin and invited him to the meeting. 
 Lenin’s reply was read out at the final sitting on April 20. 
 p. 
 319 The documents are preliminary material for Lenin’s pamphlet, The Tax in Kind (The Significance of the New Policy and Its Conditions ). 
 The first document is an initial plan of the pamphlet; on its basis, Lenin worked out a more detailed plan—Document Two— and also Documents Three and Four. 
 The third document also includes a summary of the part of the pamphlet dealing with state capitalism; and the fourth is an outline of its final part: “Political Summary and Deductions”.

 He attached great importance to its earliest publi-cation and distribution, because it explained the necessity of transition to the New Economic Policy. 
 In early May, it was published as a pamphlet, and was soon after carried by the maga-zine Krasnaya Nov No. 
 1; it later appeared in pamphlet form in many towns, and was reprinted in part and in full in central and local papers. 
 In 1921, it was translated into German, English and French.

 Lenin said their prevailing mood was one of intellectual scepticism, which is an expression of and a cover up for lack of principle.

 350 The Eighth Party Congress , held in Moscow from March 18 to 23, 1919, was attended by 301 delegates with voice and vote, and 102 with voice only. 
 They represented 313,766 Party members. 
 The items on the agenda were: 1) Report of the Central Committee; 2) Programme of the R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
); 3) Formation of the Communist International; 4) The military situation and military policy; 5) Work in the countryside; 6) Organisational questions; 7) Election to the Central Committee. 
 Lenin delivered the opening and closing speeches at the Con-gress, gave the report of the Central Committee, and the reports on the Party Programme, work in the countryside, and military policy. 
 The key problem before the Congress was the new Party Programme, worked out under Lenin’s guidance and with his participation. 
 The Congress approved Lenin’s draft Programme, and rejected Bukharin’s anti-Bolshevik proposals. 
 The Congress also supported Lenin’s programme on the nationalities question and rejected Pyatakov’s and Bukharin’s proposals to exclude from the Programme the paragraph on the right of nations to self-determination. 
 After Lenin’s summing-up speech on the Party Programme, the Congress decided to “adopt the draft Programme as a whole” and refer it to a programme commission for final editing. 
 The latter asked Lenin to write “The draft Third Paragraph of the Political Section of the Programme (For the Programme Commis-sion of the Eighth Party Congress)”, which it later adopted. 
 On March 22, the Congress approved the final text of the Programme. 
 Another key problem was the attitude to the middle peasants. 
 In his speeches, specifically in his report on work in the country-side, Lenin substantiated the Party’s new policy: transition from the policy of neutralisation to solid alliance between the working class and the middle peasantry, based on support from the poor peasants and struggle against the kulaks, with the proletariat retaining its leadership of the alliance. 
 Lenin first put forward the slogan in late November 1918. 
 The Congress adopted Lenin’s “Resolution on the Attitude Towards the Middle Peasantry”. 
 While discussing the military situation, the Party’s mili-tary policy and Red Army organisation, the so-called Military Opposition came out against the Central Committee’s theses (the Opposition included former “Left Communists”—V. 
 M. 
 Smirnov,107 108 109 G. 
 I. 
 Safarov, and G. 
 L. 
 Pyatakov—and some independents). 
 The Military Opposition favoured retention of some guerrilla methods, and opposed strict discipline in the army and enlist-ment of the services of old military specialists. 
 At a closed plenary session on March 21, Lenin spoke in defence of the C.

 theses, and was supported by most of the speakers, who denounced the Military Opposition. 
 The mistakes and shortcomings of the Revolutionary Military Council of the Republic and its Chairman, Trotsky, were exposed and severely criticised in the military section and at plenary sessions. 
 The C. 
C. 
 theses were assumed as a basis by a majority of 174 against 95, and a co-ordination commission worked out a resolution on the military question based on Lenin’s directives, which was adopted by the Congress (with only one abstention). 
 Lenin’s ideas on the military question were incorporated in the Party Programme and served as guidance in military organisation. 
 The resolution on the organisational question denounced the Sapronov-Osinsky opportunist group, which denied the Party’s leadership within the system of the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
 The decision on Party organisation stressed the need to raise the standards for admission of non-worker and non-peasant ele-ments into the Party, to maintain its social composition. 
 It was decided to carry out a general registration of all Party members by May 1, 1919. 
 The Congress rejected the federal principle of Party organisation and approved the principle of an integrated centralised Communist Party working under the guidance of a single Central Committee. 
 The newly elected Central Committee was headed by Lenin. 
 The Congress welcomed the establishment of the Third (Communist) International and adopted its platform. 
 p. 
 351 An international association of Centrist parties and groups (temporarily made to leave the Second International by revolutionary-minded workers’ masses) called the “Two-and-a-Half International”. 
 It was set up in Vienna in 1921 and broke up in 1923, when it rejoined the Second International. 
 p. 
 356 The Menshevik émigré journal, Sotsialistichesky Vestnik (Socialist Herald ), was founded by L. 
 Martov. 
 It was published in Berlin from 1921, and later in Paris. 
 It is now published in the United States. 
 p. 
 359 Sixteen of Lenin’s speeches were recorded by the Central Periodi-cals Administration from 1919 to 1921. 
 After the only record factory in Russia was restored, Lenin showed great interest in propaganda through records and in many ways helped to organise it. 
 His first speeches were recorded in a specially equipped room at the Kremlin and the last, at the Central Periodicals Administra-tion. 
 Recording time was three minutes, and Lenin was always pleased when he managed to stay within limits. 
 Sales ran to tens of thousands of records with special popularity enjoyed by his110 111 112 speeches, “On the Middle Peasants”, “What is the Soviet Power?” and “On the Tax in Kind”. 
 The speeches published in this volume were recorded on April 25, 1921. 
 p. 
 366 Under a resolution of the Tenth Party Congress (March 21, 1921) the All-Russia Central Executive Committee issued a decision (March 23) on the substitution of a tax in kind for the surplus appropriation system. 
 In pursuance of that decision, the Council of People’s Commissars approved on March 28 and published on March 29 two decrees: “The Amount of the Tax in Kind for 1921-22” and “On Free Exchange, Purchase and Sale of Farm Produce in Gubernias Fulfilling Appropriations”. 
 On April 21 and later, the Council of People’s Commissars adopted decisions on the tax rate for grain, potatoes, oil seeds and other farm produce. 
 p. 
 366 Lenin worked on the draft Instructions at the same time as he was preparing a draft decision of the C. 
L. 
D. 
 (Council of Labour and Defence), entitled “On Local Economic Meetings, Records and Reports, and Guidance by the C. 
L. 
D. 
’s Instructions”. 
 Lenin made a thorough study of local documents on economic meetings and the first NEP measures. 
 On May 20, 1921, the C. 
L. 
D. 
 referred the draft Instructions and the draft decision to a special commission, which published the Instructions as a pamphlet because it was important to discuss them immediately. 
 Members of the Presid-ium of the State Planning Commission and officials of depart-ments and local bodies were invited to help edit the two drafts. 
 On Lenin’s proposal they were widely discussed by the working people. 
 On May 24, they were discussed by the Fourth Congress of Economic Councils. 
 On May 25, the Fourth All-Russia Congress of Trade Unions instructed the newly elected All-Russia Central Council of Trade Unions to consider the drafts and to insert the necessary amendments and addenda. 
 The Tenth All-Russia Conference of the R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
) approved the draft Instructions, authorising the All-Russia C. 
E. 
C. 
 Communist Group to take steps to got them adopted as law. 
 On May 30, both drafts were discussed at the Third Session of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee, where Lenin delivered a speech. 
 The session adopted them as a basis and referred them to a commission. 
 Lenin introduced a number of editorial amendments to the C. 
E. 
C. 
 decision, “On Local Economic Meetings”, just before its final approval. 
 On June 30, both drafts were adopted by the Presidium of the C. 
E. 
C. 
 Because the Instructions defined the tasks of recording and reporting for all Commissariats and not only the economic ones, they were called “Instructions of the Council of People’s Commissars and the Council of Labour and Defence”. 
 Lenin believed it was highly important to give the working people a thorough explanation of these Instructions and put them into practice as soon as possible. 
 p. 
 375113 114 An extraordinary conference, held in Moscow from May 26 to 28, 1921, was attended by 239 delegates from Party and Soviet organisations. 
 On its agenda were the following questions: 1) Eco-nomic policy: a) tax in kind; b) co-operatives; c) financial reform; d) small industry; 2) The current role of the Socialist-Revolution-aries and Mensheviks; 3) The Third Congress of the Comintern; 4) Information on the Fourth Trade Union Congress; 5) Organisa-tional question. 
 The Conference centred on the question of the New Eco-nomic Policy (NEP) because it was not yet clear enough to the people in the localities. 
 Lenin guided the work of the Conference: he delivered the opening speech, spoke on the agenda, was elected to the Presidium, gave a report and a summing-up speech on the tax in kind, and the closing speech of the Conference. 
 Substantiating the New Economic Policy, he exposed the false rumours about NEP and distortions of this policy, and stressed that it was a policy whose aim was the construc-tion of a socialist society, that it was to be carried out “in earnest and for a long time”. 
 The Conference adopted Lenin’s draft resolution, “On Economic Policy”, which confirmed NEP’s basic principles and gave concrete instructions for their implementation. 
 It said: “The basic political task of the moment is for all Party and Soviet workers to master and implement to the letter the New Economic Policy.

 After the Conference had heard information on the work of the Fourth Trade Union Congress, Lenin sharply criticised the factional activity of the trade union leadership, first and foremost M. 
 P. 
 Tomsky, Chairman of the All-Russia Central Council of Trade Unions. 
 Another question of great importance was the organisational work of the Party, the report on which was given by V. 
 M. 
 Molotov. 
 The Conference adopted a “Plan for the Work of the Central Committee of the R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
)” which demanded the training and promotion of new Party workers and activisation of all Party and Soviet work. 
 Lenin stressed that Party organisations had to establish closer ties with the non-Party masses and that it was necessary to collect and study the experience of local Party organi-sations. 
 His remarks were taken into account in the resolution. 
 Representatives of the Communist Parties of Germany and the United States conveyed greetings to the Conference, and, on the motion of the Presidium, the Conference cabled a message of greetings to workers detained in prison. 
 p. 
 399 The reference is to the Fourth All-Russia Congress of Trade Unions, held in Moscow from May 17 to 25, 1921, and the Fourth All-Russia Congress of Economic Councils, held there from May 18 to 24, 1921. 
 The Fourth Congress of Trade Unions had the following items on its agenda: report of the All-Russia Central Council of Trade115 116 Unions; report of the Presidium of the Supreme Economic Council; the role and tasks of the trade unions and economic development; organisational question; wage-rate policy and workers’ supply; trade unions and co-operatives; labour protection, etc.

 organisation, report of the State Planning Commission; report on foreign trade; electri-fication of Russia; material resources of the Republic and organisation of supply in industry. 
 The most important questions were discussed at joint sittings of the two congresses with the participation of specialists and public figures. 
 p. 
 415 Colonel of the gendarmerie Zubatov, Chief of the Secret Political Police, proposed the setting up of legal workers’ organisations in 1901-03 to divert the workers from political struggle against the tsarist autocracy, and to switch their attention to narrow economic demands which the government, he asserted, was ready to meet. 
 The Minister for the Interior, V. 
 K. 
 Plehve, approved Zubatov’s activity and the first organisation, called “Workers’ mutual aid in mechanical industries society”, was set up in Moscow in May 1901, and later such societies made their appearance in Minsk, Odessa, Vilno, Kiev, and other towns. 
 The Second Congress of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
, in its resolution “On the Trade Union Struggle”, defined Zubatovism as a policy of “systematic betrayal of working class interests for the benefit of the capitalists”, and in order to fight it, called on Party organi-sations to support and lead any strikes started by legal workers’ organisations. 
 Revolutionary Social-Democrats made use of such organisa-tions to draw the masses of working people into the struggle against the tsarist government, exposing the reactionary nature of Zubatov’s policy. 
 Lenin wrote in 1905: “And now the Zubatov movement is outgrowing its bounds. 
 Initiated by the police in the interests of the police, in the interests of supporting the autocracy and demoralising the political consciousness of the workers, this movement is turning against the autocracy and is becoming an outbreak of the proletarian class struggle. 
” The tsarist government had to close down the Zubatov organi-sations in 1903 because of the mounting revolutionary movement.

 Kalinin’s report on the activity of its Presidium, the sowing campaign, agencies co-ordi-nating the activity of economic Commissariats and local economic bodies; substitution of a tax in kind for appropriation, Petrograd industry, and reorganisation of tribunals. 
 It heard reports by the Tver Gubernia Executive Committee and the Siberian Revolu-tionary Committee.

 p. 
 438 The Conference was held in Moscow from June 16 to 24, 1921, and was attended by 499 delegates: gubernia food commissars, members of gubernia food committee collegiums, and representati-ves of various food agencies and gubernia executive committees, co-operatives and trade unions. 
 The questions on the agenda were: 1) tax in kind; 2) commodity exchange; 3) relationship between the food agencies and co-operatives; 4) principles of the state supply, etc. 
 Lenin was elected an honorary member of the Presidium and spoke at the first sitting. 
 The Conference helped to improve the food situation in the country.

 444 The Third Congress was held in Moscow from June 22 to July 12, 1921. 
 Its 605 delegates (291 with voice and vote, and 314 with voice only) represented 103 organisations from 52 countries, name-ly: 48 Communist Parties, 8 Socialist Parties, 28 Youth Leagues, 4 syndicalist organisations, 2 opposition Communist Parties (the Communist Workers’ Party of Germany and the Workers’ Communist Party of Spain) and 13 other organisations. 
 The 72 delegates from the Russian Communist Party of Bolsheviks were headed by Lenin. 
 The Congress discussed the world economic crisis and the new tasks of the Communist International; the report on the activity of the Executive Committee of the Communist International; the Communist Workers’ Party of Germany; the Italian question; the tactics of the Communist International; the attitude of the Red International Council of Trade Unions to the Communist International; the struggle against the Amster-dam International; the tactics of the R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
); the Communist International and the Communist youth movement; the women’s movement; the United Communist Party of Germany, etc. 
 Lenin directed preparations for and the activities of the Con-gress; he was elected its Honorary Chairman; he took part in draft-ing all the key resolutions; he gave a report on the tactics of the R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
); he spoke in defence of the Communist International’s tactics, on the Italian question; in the commissions and at the enlarged sittings of the Executive Committee of the Comintern, and at the delegates’ meetings. 
 Before and during the Congress, Lenin met and talked with delegates about the state of affairs in the Communist Parties. 
119 120 121 The Third Congress had a great influence on the formation and development of young Communist Parties. 
 It paid great attention to the Comintern’s organisation and tactics in the new conditions of the world communist movement. 
 Lenin had to combat the Centrist deviation and “Leftist” dogmatism, pseudo-revolution-ary “Leftist” cant and sectarianism. 
 As a result, revolutionary Marxism prevailed over the “Leftist” danger. 
 In the history of the world communist movement the Third Congress is known for the following achievements: it worked out the basic tactics of the Communist Parties; it defined the task of winning the masses over to the side of the proletariat, strength-ening working-class unity and implementing united front tactics. 
 The most important aspect of its resolutions, Lenin said, was “more careful, more thorough preparation for fresh and more decisive battles, both defensive and offensive”.

 451 On April 13, 1919, in Amritsar, an industrial centre in Punjab, India, British troops fired on a mass meeting of working people who were protesting against the colonialist reign of terror. 
 About 1,000 were killed and 2,000 wounded. 
 The massacre led to popular uprisings in Punjab and other provinces, which were ruthlessly suppressed by the British colonialists.

 462 The conference of the reformist wing of the Italian Socialist Party, the so-called “socialist concentration” group, took place in Reggio Emilia on October 10-11, 1920. 
 Lenin gave a detailed characteristic of it in his article, “On the Struggle Within the Italian Social-ist Party” ( Collected Works , Vol. 
 31, pp. 
 377-96). 
 The report on the conference mentioned by Lenin was pub-lished in Corriere della Sera No.

 245, of October 11 and 12, 1920, as well as in Avanti! No.

122 123 124 125 126 127 Avanti! (Forward!)—a daily, the Central Organ of the Italian Socialist Party, founded in Rome in December 1896. 
 During the First World War, it took an inconsistently internationalist stand, and did not break with the reformists. 
 In 1926, the paper was closed down by Mussolini’s fascist government, but continued to appear abroad. 
 It resumed publication in Italy in 1943. 
 p. 
 462 Lenin apparently refers to the conference of the “unitary” group (Serrati, Baratono and others) in Florence on November 20-21, 1920, which came out against the break with the reformists and, with this reservation, for the acceptance of the 21 conditions of affilia-tion to the Communist International. 
 p. 
 463 In January 1919, the Ebert-Scheidemann government dismissed the Berlin police chief, Eichhorn (a Left-wing Independent) who was very popular with the workers. 
 This sparked off a workers’ protest demonstration on January 4, the day following Eichhorn’s retirement, and later a general strike and an armed uprising to overthrow the Ebert-Scheidemann government. 
 The Revolution-ary Committee of Action which headed the uprising included some Independents and Karl Liebknecht and Wilhelm Pieck of the Communist Party of Germany. 
 The Communist Party consid-ered the uprising premature, but decided to support the revolu-tionary mass movement in every way. 
 Berlin events fired the proletariat’s revolutionary struggle in the Rheinland, the Ruhr, Bremen and elsewhere. 
 Alarmed by the scope of the movement, the Central Committee of the Independent Social-Democratic Party of Germany started negotiations with the government, who used them for preparing a counter-revolutionary offensive. 
 On January 11, its forces, led by Noske, attacked the workers and drowned their uprising in blood. 
 Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, the leaders of the German working class, were arrested and killed at the height of the counter-revolutionary reign of terror. 
 Workers’ action in other parts of the country was fiercely suppressed. 
 p. 
 463 In September 1920, Italian steelworkers occupied their mills on the initiative of their trade union, which was in conflict with the association of industrialists. 
 The movement started in Turin and Milan, then spread through Piedmont and Northern Italy across the country, from the metallurgical industry to other industries and to agriculture. 
 In Sicily and in other areas peasants occupied the land. 
 The scope of the movement jeopardised the capitalist regime, but the reformist leaders of the Socialist Party and the trade unions, terrified by the political character of the movement, adopted a decision to confine it to within the trade unions and prevent it from developing into a revolution. 
 They also decided to start negotiations with the industrialists. 
 This was a hard blow at the Italian workers’ movement and showed the leaders’ inability to lead the mass forces. 
 Fascism used128 129 130 131 the confusion within the working class to start its armed offensive in Italy. 
 p. 
 465 The amendments were proposed by the German, Austrian and Italian delegations to the draft theses on tactics, motioned by the Russian delegation at the Third Congress of the Comintern. 
 They were published in German in Moskau , the organ of the Third Congress. 
 p. 
 468 The Open Letter (Offener Brief) of the Central Committee of the United Communist Party of Germany to the Socialist Party of Germany, Independent Social-Democratic Party of Germany, the Communist Workers’ Party of Germany and all trade unions, was published in Die Rote Fahne (The Red Banner) on January 8, 1921. 
 The U. 
C. 
P. 
G. 
 called on all workers, trade unions and social-ist organisations to unite their forces in combating reaction and the capitalists’ offensive against the working people’s vital rights. 
 Their programme of joint action included demands for higher pensions for disabled war veterans; elimination of unem-ployment; improvement of the country’s finances at the expense of the monopolies, introduction of factory and plant committee control over all stocks of food, raw materials and fuel restarting of all closed enterprises; control over sowing, harvesting and marketing of farm produce by the Peasants’ Councils together with the agricultural labourers’ organisations; immediate disarming and dissolution of all bourgeois militarised organisations; establish-ment of workers’ self-defence; amnesty of all political prisoners; immediate re-establishment of trade and diplomatic relations with Soviet Russia. 
 Lenin said these tactics were “ quite correct ” (see Lenin Miscellany XXXVI , p. 
 221). 
 The Right-wing leaders of the organisations to whom the Open Letter was addressed rejected the proposal for joint action with the Communists, despite the fact that the workers came out for a united front of the proletariat. 
 p. 
 470 The theory of an offensive struggle or “theory of the offensive” was proclaimed at the Unity Congress of the Communist Party of Germany and the Left-wing Independent Social-Democratic Party of Germany in December 1920. 
 It envisaged that the party should conduct offensive tactics, regardless of whether there were any objective conditions for revolutionary activity or whether the working people supported the Communist Party. 
 The theory found its followers among the “Leftists” in Hungary, Czechoslo-vakia, Italy, Austria, and France, and was one of the causes of the defeat of the March 1921 uprising in Germany. 
 But the “Left-ists” tried to justify the mistakes of the Central Committee of the U. 
C. 
P. 
G. 
 The theses on the March uprising adopted by the U. 
C. 
P. 
G. 
 Central Committee on April 8, 1921, reiterated that the132 133 134 U. 
C. 
P. 
G. 
 was always to “follow the line of revolutionary offen-sive” and that offensive tactics, “even when unsuccessful, were a prerequisite of future victory and the only means for a revolu-tionary party to win over the masses”. 
 At the Third Congress of the Comintern the followers of this theory fought to make it the basis of the Communist International’s resolutions on tactics. 
 Lenin proved this theory to be wrong and adventurous, and the Con-gress approved his line of patient preparation and winning over of the majority of the working class to the side of the communist movement.

 The Congress adopted the Rules of the Red Trade Union International, and elected its Central Council. 
 It also adopted resolutions on other questions. 
 The Trade Union International fought for unity in the trade union movement on the basis of the revolutionary struggle for working-class demands; against the offensive of capital and139 140 141 142 fascism, and the danger of an imperialist war. 
 It worked for unity with the working class of Soviet Russia.

 501 Lenin’s Appeal to the International Proletariat in connection with the famine which hit almost 33 million people in the Volga area and South Ukraine met with a broad response among the working people of all countries. 
 An “ Ad hoc Foreign Committee for Assistance to Russia” was set up on the initiative of the Comin-tern in August 1921. 
 French revolutionary trade unions called on the workers to contribute a day’s earnings for the famine stricken population of Russia. 
 Henri Barbusse and Anatole France played an active part in organising assistance, and the latter contributed to the fund the Nobel Prize he was awarded in 1921. 
 About one million francs were collected in France. 
 Czechoslovakia contributed 7.

 In January 1921, at the Unity Congress in Leeds, it was joined by the Communist Workers’ Party (consisting mostly of members of the shop stewards movement in Scotland, headed by William143 144 145 Gallacher) and the Workers’ Socialist Federation. 
 The formation of the British Communist Party was completed when the Left wing of the Independent Workers’ Party, headed by Palme Dutt, joined it in the spring of 1921.

P. 
D. 
) (United Communist Party of Germany) was formed at the Unity Congress of the German Communist Party and the Left wing of the Independ-ent Social-Democratic Party of Germany. 
 It was held in Berlin from December 4 to 7, 1920. 
 In October 1920, the Independent Social-Democratic Party of Germany split at the Congress in Halle when the majority demanded immediate affiliation to the Third International and complete adoption of the 21 condi-tions of affiliation worked out by the Second Congress of the Comintern. 
 The Right wing of the party walked out of the Halle Congress and, under the old name, formed a separate party, which later, in September 1922, joined the Social-Democratic Party. 
 Lenin sent his letter to the Second Congress of the German Communist party, which was held in Jena from August 22 to 26, 1921. 
 The items on the agenda were: the Third Congress of the Comintern; the party’s immediate tasks; trade union activity; the famine in Soviet Russia and ways of helping her, etc. 
 One of the chairmen as Wilhelm Pieck. 
 A resolution adopted by an overwhelming majority approved the decisions of the Third Congress of the Comintern and acknowledged the correctness of thecriticism in the theses of the Third Congress of the party’s mistakes during the March 1921 uprising. 
 The party resumed its old name of the Communist Party of Germany.

 512 The Basle Manifesto of 191/FL0063 on war was adopted by the Extraor-dinary International Socialist Congress in Basle held on November 24-25, 1912. 
 It warned the peoples of the danger of a world-wide imperialist war, exposed its predatory aims and called on the workers to fight for peace, confronting “capitalist imperialism with the international solidarity of the proletariat”. 
 The Mani-festo included Lenin’s clause, taken from the Stuttgart Congress resolution (1907), that in the event of the outbreak of an imperial-ist war, the Socialists should utilise the economic and political crisis caused by the war to hasten the downfall of capitalist class rule and fight for a socialist revolution.

 513 Sowjet (Soviet)—a monthly published in Berlin from 1919 to July 1921. 
 It was edited by Paul Levi, and among its contributors were Henriette Roland-Holst, Paul Frölich, Adolf Maslow, Fritz Geyer, and others. 
 From July 1, 1921, when Paul Levi was expelled from the United Communist Party of Germany, the magazine changed its political complexion and adopted the name of Unser Weg (Our Way). 
 It was closed down at the end of 1922. 
 p. 
 514146 147 148 Die Rote Fahne (The Red Banner)—a paper founded by Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg as the Central Organ of the Spartacus League; it later became the Central Organ of the Commu-nist Party of Germany. 
 It was published in Berlin from Novem-ber 9, 1918, but was continuously harassed and repeatedly closed down by the authorities. 
 The paper played an important role in turning the Communist Party into a truly mass proletarian and revolutionary party, free from all kinds of opportunists. 
 It stood for united working-class action against the country’s militarisation and the spread of nazism. 
 Ernst Thälmann, Chairman of the C. 
C. 
 of the Com-munist Party of Germany, was an active contributor. 
 After the nazi dictatorship was set up, the paper was closed down but continued to appear illegally. 
 From 1935 it was issued in Prague, and from October 1936 to late 1939, in Brussels.
