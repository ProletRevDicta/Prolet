 I. 
 Lenin written between December 1913 and August 1914, with the excep-tion of the article “Critical Remarks on the NationalQuestion”, which was written somewhat earlier and pub-lished serially in October to December 1913. 
 The bulk of the volume is devoted to the Bolsheviks’ struggle against opportunism in the Russian and internationallabour movement: against the liquidators, the Trotskyists,the Vperyod group, the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the opportunists of the Second International. 
 Among these are the articles: “The Break-up of the ‘August’ Bloc”, “Disrup-tion of Unity Under Cover of Outcries for Unity”, “Narodismand Liquidationism as Disintegrating Elements in theWorking-Class Movement”.

C. 
 Dele-gation, “A Fool’s Haste Is No Speed”, “Comment on Kaut-sky’s Letter”. 
 The Bolshevik programme on the national question is elaborated in the articles “Critical Remarks on the Nation-al Question” and “The Right of Nations to Self-Determi-nation”. 
 A conspicuous place in the volume is occupied by articles on the agrarian question, among them “The Peasantry andHired Labour”, “Serf Economy in the Rural Areas” and“The Agrarian Question in Russia”. 
 Articles published for the first time in Lenin’s Collected Works are “The Liquidators and the Decisions of the Lettish Marxists”, “Reply to the Article in Leipziger Volks-zeitung ”. 
 In these articles Lenin denounces the liquidators’ attempts to distort Party decisions and conceal objective data concerning monetary contributions to the Marxist and liquidationist newspapers. 
 Other articles included for the first time in the Collected Works are: “Bill on the Equality of Nations and the Safeguarding of the Rights ofNational Minorities”, and “The Polish Social-DemocraticOpposition at the Parting of the Ways”. 
 These were pub-lished previously in Lenin Miscellany XXX . 
 The Instructions to the Central Committee Delegation to the Brussels-Conference have been supplemented by a newletter of Lenin’s. 
 In previous editions of the Collected Works the draft speech on “The Estimates of the Ministry of Agriculture”was published from the manuscript, four pages of which were missing. 
 In the present edition the missing pages, which were found in 1941, have been restored.

 Lenin CRITICAL REMARKS ON THE NATIONAL QUESTION1 Written in October-December 1913 Published in 1913 in the journal Published according to Prosveshcheniye Nos. 
 10, 11, and 12 the journal text Signed: N. 
 Lenin It is obvious that the national question has now become prominent among the problems of Russian public life. 
 The aggressive nationalism of the reactionaries, the transition of counter-revolutionary bourgeois liberalism to national-ism (particularly Great-Russian, but also Polish, Jewish,Ukrainian, etc. 
), and lastly, the increase of nationalistvacillations among the different “national” (i. 
e. 
, non-Great-Russian) Social-Democrats, who have gone to the length of violating the Party Programme—all these make it incumbent on us to give more attention to the nationalquestion than we have done so far. 
 This article pursues a special object, namely, to exam-ine, in their general bearing, precisely these programmevacillations of Marxists and would-be Marxists, on the national question. 
 In Severnaya Pravda2 No. 
 29 (for Sep-tember 5, 1913, “Liberals and Democrats on the LanguageQuestion” *) I had occasion to speak of the opportunism of the liberals on the national question; this article of minewas attacked by the opportunist Jewish newspaper Zeit , 3 in an article by Mr. 
 F. 
 Liebman. 
 From the other side, the programme of the Russian Marxists on the national ques-tion had been criticised by the Ukrainian opportunistMr. 
 Lev Yurkevich ( Dzvin , 4 1913, Nos. 
 7-8). 
 Both these writers touched upon so many questions that to reply tothem we are obliged to deal with the most diverse aspectsof the subject. 
 I think the most convenient thing would be to start with a reprint of the article from Severnaya Pravda .

 LIBERALS AND DEMOCRATS ON THE LANGUAGE QUESTION On several occasions the newspapers have mentioned the report of the Governor of the Caucasus, a report that isnoteworthy, not for its Black-Hundred 5 spirit, but for its timid “liberalism”. 
 Among other things, the Governor ob-jects to artificial Russification of non-Russian nationali-ties. 
 Representatives of non-Russian nationalities in the Caucasus are themselves striving to teach their children Rus-sian; an example of this is the Armenian church schools,in which the teaching of Russian is not obligatory. 
 Russkoye Slovo6 (No. 
 198), one of the most widely cir-culating liberal newspapers in Russia, points to this factand draws the correct conclusion that the hostility towards the Russian language in Russia “stems exclusively from” the “artificial” (it should have said “forced”) implantingof that language. 
 “There is no reason to worry about the fate of the Russian language. 
 It will itself win recognition throughout Russia,”says the newspaper. 
 This is perfectly true, because the requirements of economic exchange will always compel the nationalities living in one state (as long as they wish tolive together) to study the language of the majority. 
 Themore democratic the political system in Russia becomes,the more powerfully, rapidly and extensively capitalismwill develop, the more urgently will the requirements of economic exchange impel various nationalities to study the language most convenient for general commercial relations. 
 The liberal newspaper, however, hastens to slap itself in the face and demonstrate its liberal inconsistency. 
 “Even those who oppose Russification,” it says, “would hardly be likely to deny that in a country as huge as Russia there must be one single official language, and that this language can be only Russian. 
” Logic turned inside out! Tiny Switzerland has not lost anything, but has gained from having not one single official language, but three—German, French and Italian. 
 InSwitzerland 70 per cent of the population are Germans (in Russia 43 per cent are Great Russians), 22 per cent French (in Russia 17 per cent are Ukrainians) and 7 per cent Italians(in Russia 6 per cent are Poles and 4. 
5 per cent Byelorus-sians). 
 If Italians in Switzerland often speak French in their common parliament they do not do so because they are menaced by some savage police law (there are none such in Switzerland), but because the civilised citizens of a demo-cratic state themselves prefer a language that is understoodby a majority. 
 The French language does not instil hatredin Italians because it is the language of a free civilisednation, a language that is not imposed by disgusting police measures. 
 Why should “huge” Russia, a much more varied and ter-ribly backward country, inhibit her development by the retention of any kind of privilege for any one language?Should not the contrary be true, liberal gentlemen? Shouldnot Russia, if she wants to overtake Europe, put an end to every kind of privilege as quickly as possible, as completely as possible and as vigorously as possible? If all privileges disappear, if the imposition of any one language ceases, all Slavs will easily and rapidly learn tounderstand each other and will not be frightened by the“horrible” thought that speeches in different languages will be heard in the common parliament. 
 The requirements of economic exchange will themselves decide which language of the given country it is to the advantage of the majority to know in the interests of commercial relations. 
 This decisionwill be all the firmer because it is adopted voluntarily by apopulation of various nationalities, and its adoption will be the more rapid and extensive the more consistent the democracy and, as a consequence of it, the more rapid thedevelopment of capitalism. 
 The liberals approach the language question in the same way as they approach all political questions—like hypo-critical hucksters, holding out one hand (openly) to democ-racy and the other (behind their backs) to the feudalists and police. 
 We are against privileges, shout the liberals,and under cover they haggle with the feudalists for firstone, then another, privilege. 
 Such is the nature of all liberal-bourgeois nationalism— not only Great-Russian (it is the worst of them all because of its violent character and its kinship with the Purishke-viches 7), but Polish, Jewish, Ukrainian, Georgian and every other nationalism. 
 Under the slogan of “national culture” the bourgeoisie of all nations, both in Austria and in Russia, are in fact pursuing the policy of splitting the workers, emasculating democracy and haggling with the feudalists over the sale of the people’s rights and the people’s liberty. 
 The slogan of working-class democracy is not “national culture” but the international culture of democracy and theworld-wide working-class movement. 
 Let the bourgeoisiedeceive the people with various “positive” national pro-grammes. 
 The class-conscious worker will answer the bour-geoisie—there is only one solution to the national problem(insofar as it can, in general, be solved in the capitalistworld, the world of profit, squabbling and exploitation),and that solution is consistent democracy. 
 The proof—Switzerland in Western Europe, a country with an old culture and Finland in Eastern Europe, a coun-try with a young culture. 
 The national programme of working-class democracy is: absolutely no privileges for any one nation or any onelanguage; the solution of the problem of the political self-determination of nations, that is, their separation as states by completely free, democratic methods; the promulgation of a law for the whole state by virtue of which any measure(rural, urban or communal, etc. 
, etc. 
) introducing any priv-ilege of any kind for one of the nations and militatingagainst the equality of nations or the rights of a nationalminority, shall be declared illegal and ineffective, and any citizen of the state shall have the right to demand that such a measure be annulled as unconstitutional, andthat those who attempt to put it into effect be punished. 
 Working-class democracy contraposes to the nationalist wrangling of the various bourgeois parties over questionsof language, etc. 
, the demand for the unconditional unity and complete amalgamation of workers of all nationalities in all working-class organisations—trade union, co-opera-tive, consumers’, educational and all others—in contra-distinction to any kind of bourgeois nationalism. 
 Only this type of unity and amalgamation can uphold democracy and defend the interests of the workers against capital—which is already international and is becoming more so—and pro-mote the development of mankind towards a new way of life that is alien to all privileges and all exploitation. 
 2. 
 “NATIONAL CULTURE” As the reader will see, the article in Severnaya Pravda , made use of a particular example, i. 
e. 
, the problem of theofficial language to illustrate the inconsistency and op-portunism of the liberal bourgeoisie, which, in the nationalquestion, extends a hand to the feudalists and the police. 
Everybody will understand that, apart from the problem of an official language, the liberal bourgeoisie behaves just as treacherously, hypocritically and stupidly (even fromthe standpoint of the interests of liberalism) in a numberof other related issues. 
 The conclusion to be drawn from this? It is that all liberal-bourgeois nationalism sows the greatest corruption among the workers and does immense harm to the cause of freedom and the proletarian class struggle. 
 This bourgeois(and bourgeois-feudalist) tendency is all the more dangerousfor its being concealed behind the slogan of “national cul-ture”. 
 It is under the guise of national culture—GreatRussian, Polish, Jewish, Ukrainian, and so forth—that the Black-Hundreds and the clericals, and also the bourgeoisie of all nations, are doing their dirty and reactionary work. 
 Such are the facts of the national life of today, if viewed from the Marxist angle, i. 
e. 
, from the standpoint of theclass struggle, and if the slogans are compared with the interests and policies of classes, and not with meaningless “general principles”, declamations and phrases. 
 The slogan of national culture is a bourgeois (and often also a Black-Hundred and clerical) fraud. 
 Our slogan is:the international culture of democracy and of the worldworking-class movement. 
 Here the Bundist 8 Mr. 
 Liebman rushes into the fray and annihilates me with the following deadly tirade: “Anyone in the least familiar with the national question knows that international culture is not non-national culture (culture without a national form); non-national culture, which must not be Russian, Jewish, or Polish, but only pure culture, is nonsense, internationalideas can appeal to the working class only when they are adaptedto the language spoken by the worker, and to the concrete nationalconditions under which he lives; the worker should not be indifferentto the condition and development of his national culture, because it is through it, and only through it, that he is able to participate in the ‘international culture of democracy and of the world working-class movement’. 
 This is well known, but V. 
 I. 
 turns a deaf ear toit all.... 
” Ponder over this typically Bundist argument, designed, if you please, to demolish the Marxist thesis that I advanced. 
With the air of supreme self-confidence of one who is“familiar with the national question”, this Bundist passes off ordinary bourgeois views as “well-known” axioms. 
 It is true, my dear Bundist, that international culture is not non-national. 
 Nobody said that it was. 
 Nobody hasproclaimed a “pure” culture, either Polish, Jewish, orRussian, etc. 
, and your jumble of empty words is simplyan attempt to distract the reader’s attention and to obscure the issue with tinkling words. 
 The elements of democratic and socialist culture are present, if only in rudimentary form, in every national culture, since in every nation there are toiling and exploited masses, whose conditions of life inevitably give rise to theideology of democracy and socialism. 
 But every nation also possesses a bourgeois culture (and most nations a reac-tionary and clerical culture as well) in the form, not merelyof “elements”, but of the dominant culture. 
 Therefore, the general “national culture” is the culture of the landlords,the clergy and the bourgeoisie. 
 This fundamental and, for aMarxist, elementary truth, was kept in the background by the Bundist, who “drowned” it in his jumble of words, i. 
e. 
, instead of revealing and clarifying the class gulf to the reader, he in fact obscured it. 
 In fact , the Bundist acted like a bourgeois, whose every interest requires the spreadingof a belief in a non-class national culture. 
 In advancing the slogan of “the international culture of democracy and of the world working-class movement”, we take from each national culture only its democratic and socialist elements; we take them only and absolutely in opposition to the bourgeois culture and the bourgeois na-tionalism of each nation. 
 No democrat, and certainly no Marxist, denies that all languages should have equal status, or that it is necessary to polemise with one’s “native” bour-geoisie in one’s native language and to advocate anti-clericalor anti-bourgeois ideas among one’s “native” peasantry and petty bourgeoisie. 
 That goes without saying, but the Bund-ist uses these indisputable truths to obscure the point in dispute, i. 
e. 
, the real issue. 
 The question is whether it is permissible for a Marxist, directly or indirectly, to advance the slogan of nationalculture, or whether he should oppose it by advocating, in all languages, the slogan of workers’ internationalism while “adapting” himself to all local and national fea-tures. 
 The significance of the “national culture” slogan is not determined by some petty intellectual’s promise, or goodintention, to “interpret” it as “meaning the developmentthrough it of an international culture”. 
 It would be puerilesubjectivism to look at it in that way. 
 The significance of the slogan of national culture is determined by the objective alignment of all classes in a given country, and in all coun-tries of the world. 
 The national culture of the bourgeoisie isa fact (and, I repeat, the bourgeoisie everywhere enters into deals with the landed proprietors and the clergy). 
 Aggres-sive bourgeois nationalism, which drugs the minds of the workers, stultifies and disunites them in order that the bourgeoisie may lead them by the halter—such is the funda-mental fact of the times. 
 Those who seek to serve the proletariat must unite the workers of all nations, and unswervingly fight bourgeoisnationalism, domestic and foreign. 
 The place of those who advocate the slogan of national culture is among the nation-alist petty bourgeois, not among the Marxists. 
 Take a concrete example. 
 Can a Great-Russian Marxist accept the slogan of national, Great-Russian, culture? No,he cannot. 
 Anyone who does that should stand in the ranksof the nationalists, not of the Marxists. 
 Our task is to fight the dominant, Black-Hundred and bourgeois national culture of the Great Russians, and to develop, exclusivelyin the internationalist spirit and in the closest alliancewith the workers of other countries, the rudiments alsoexisting in the history of our democratic and working-class movement. 
 Fight your own Great-Russian landlords and bourgeoisie, fight their “culture” in the name of interna-tionalism, and, in so fighting, “adapt” yourself to the specialfeatures of the Purishkeviches and Struves—that is your task, not preaching or tolerating the slogan of national culture. 
 The same applies to the most oppressed and persecuted nation—the Jews. 
 Jewish national culture is the slogan ofthe rabbis and the bourgeoisie, the slogan of our enemies. 
But there are other elements in Jewish culture and in Jew-ish history as a whole. 
 Of the ten and a half million Jewsin the world, somewhat over a half live in Galicia and Russia, backward and semi-barbarous countries, where the Jews are forcibly kept in the status of a caste. 
 The other half lives in the civilised world, and there the Jews do notlive as a segregated caste. 
 There the great world-progressivefeatures of Jewish culture stand clearly revealed: its inter-nationalism, its identification with the advanced movements of the epoch (the percentage of Jews in the democratic and proletarian movements is everywhere higher than the per-centage of Jews among the population). 
 Whoever, directly or indirectly, puts forward the slogan of Jewish “national culture” is (whatever his good intentionsmay be) an enemy of the proletariat, a supporter of all that is outmoded and connected with caste among the Jewish people; he is an accomplice of the rabbis and the bourgeoi-sie. 
 On the other hand, those Jewish Marxists who minglewith the Russian, Lithuanian, Ukrainian and other work-ers in international Marxist organisations, and make theircontribution (both in Russian and in Yiddish) towards creating the international culture of the working-class movement—those Jews, despite the separatism of theBund, uphold the best traditions of Jewry by fighting theslogan of “national culture”. 
 Bourgeois nationalism and proletarian internationalism— these are the two irreconcilably hostile slogans that cor-respond to the two great class camps throughout the capi-talist world, and express the two policies (nay, the two world outlooks) in the national question. 
 In advocating the sloganof national culture and building up on it an entire planand practical programme of what they call “cultural-nation-al autonomy”, the Bundists are in effect instruments of bourgeois nationalism among the workers. 
 3. 
 THE NATIONALIST BOGEY OF “ASSIMILATION” The question of assimilation, i. 
e. 
, of the shedding of national features, and absorption by another nation, strik-ingly illustrates the consequences of the nationalist vacil-lations of the Bundists and their fellow-thinkers. 
 Mr. 
 Liebman, who faithfully conveys and repeats the stock arguments, or rather, tricks, of the Bundists, has qualified as “the old assimilation story ” the demand for the unity and amalgamation of the workers of all nationalitiesin a given country in united workers’ organisations (seethe concluding part of the article in Severnaya Pravda ). 
 “Consequently,” says Mr. 
 F. 
 Liebman, commenting on the concluding part of the article in Severnaya Pravda , “if asked what nationality he belongs to, the worker must answer: I am a Social-Democrat. 
” Our Bundist considers this the acme of wit. 
 As a matter of fact, he gives himself away completely by such witti-cisms and outcries about “assimilation”, levelled against a consistently democratic and Marxist slogan. 
 Developing capitalism knows two historical tendencies in the national question. 
 The first is the awakening ofnational life and national movements, the struggle againstall national oppression, and the creation of national states. 
The second is the development and growing frequency ofinternational intercourse in every form, the break-down of national barriers, the creation of the international unity of capital, of economic life in general, of politics, science,etc. 
 Both tendencies are a universal law of capitalism. 
 The former predominates in the beginning of its development, thelatter characterises a mature capitalism that is moving towards its transformation into socialist society. 
 The Marx-ists’ national programme takes both tendencies into ac-count, and advocates, firstly, the equality of nations and lan-guages and the impermissibility of all privileges in this respect (and also the right of nations to self-determination,with which we shall deal separately later); secondly, the principle of internationalism and uncompromising struggle against contamination of the proletariat with bourgeoisnationalism, even of the most refined kind. 
 The question arises: what does our Bundist mean when he cries out to heaven against “assimilation”? He could not have meant the oppression of nations, or the privileges enjoyed by a particular nation, because the word “assimila-tion” here does not fit at all, because all Marxists, individ-ually, and as an official, united whole, have quite definite-ly and unambiguously condemned the slightest violenceagainst and oppression and inequality of nations, and finally because this general Marxist idea, which the Bundist has attacked, is expressed in the Severnaya Pravda article in the most emphatic manner. 
 No, evasion is impossible here. 
 In condemning “assimi-lation” Mr. 
 Liebman had in mind, not violence, not inequal-ity, and not privileges. 
 Is there anything real left in the concept of assimilation, after all violence and all inequality have been eliminated? Yes, there undoubtedly is. 
 What is left is capitalism’s world-historical tendency to break down national barriers,obliterate national distinctions, and to assimilate nations—a tendency which manifests itself more and more powerfully with every passing decade, and is one of the greatest driving forces transforming capitalism into socialism. 
 Whoever does not recognise and champion the equality of nations and languages, and does not fight against allnational oppression or inequality, is not a Marxist; he isnot even a democrat. 
 That is beyond doubt. 
 But it is also beyond doubt that the pseudo-Marxist who heaps abuse upon a Marxist of another nation for being an “assimilator”is simply a nationalist philistine . 
 In this unhandsome cate-gory of people are all the Bundists and (as we shall shortlysee) Ukrainian nationalist-socialists such as L. 
 Yurkevich,Dontsov and Co. 
 To show concretely how reactionary the views held by these nationalist philistines are, we shall cite facts of threekinds. 
 It is the Jewish nationalists in Russia in general, and the Bundists in particular, who vociferate most aboutRussian orthodox Marxists being “assimilators”. 
 And yet, as the afore-mentioned figures show, out of the ten and a half million Jews all over the world, about half that number live in the civilised world, where conditions favouring “assimilation” are strongest , whereas the unhappy, down-trodden, disfranchised Jews in Russia and Galicia, who are crushed under the heel of the Purishkeviches (Russian and Polish), live where conditions for “assimilation” least prevail, where there is most segregation, and even a “Paleof Settlement”, 9 a numerus clausus10 and other charming features of the Purishkevich regime. 
 The Jews in the civilised world are not a nation, they have in the main become assimilated, say Karl Kautsky and Otto Bauer. 
 The Jews in Galicia and in Russia are not anation; unfortunately (through no fault of their own but through that of the Purishkeviches), they are still a caste here. 
 Such is the incontrovertible judgement of people whoare undoubtedly familiar with the history of Jewry and take the above-cited facts into consideration. 
 What do these facts prove? It is that only Jewish reaction-ary philistines, who want to turn back the wheel of history,and make it proceed, not from the conditions prevailing inRussia and Galicia to those prevailing in Paris and NewYork, but in the reverse direction—only they can clamour against “assimilation”. 
 The best Jews, those who are celebrated in world history, and have given the world foremost leaders of democracyand socialism, have never clamoured against assimilation. 
It is only those who contemplate the “rear aspect” ofJewry with reverential awe that clamour against assim-ilation. 
 A rough idea of the scale which the general process of assimilation of nations is assuming under the present con-ditions of advanced capitalism may be obtained, for example,from the immigration statistics of the United States ofAmerica. 
 During the decade between 1891-1900, Europe sent 3,700,000 people there, and during the nine years be-tween 1901 and 1909, 7,200,000. 
 The 1900 census in theUnited States recorded over 10,000,000 foreigners. 
 NewYork State, in which, according to the same census; therewere over 78,000 Austrians, 136,000 Englishmen, 20,000Frenchmen, 480,000 Germans, 37,000 Hungarians, 425,000 Irish 182,000 Italians, 70,000 Poles, 166,000 people from Russia (mostly Jews), 43,000 Swedes, etc. 
, grinds downnational distinctions. 
 And what is taking place on a grand, international scale in New York is also to be seen in every big city and industrial township. 
 No one unobsessed by nationalist prejudices can fail to perceive that this process of assimilation of nations bycapitalism means the greatest historical progress, the break-down of hidebound national conservatism in the variousbackwoods, especially in backward countries like Russia. 
 Take Russia and the attitude of Great Russians towards the Ukrainians. 
 Naturally, every democrat, not to mention Marxists, will strongly oppose the incredible humiliationof Ukrainians, and demand complete equality for them. 
But it would be a downright betrayal of socialism and asilly policy even from the standpoint of the bourgeois “nation-al aims” of the Ukrainians to weaken the ties and the alli-ance between the Ukrainian and Great-Russian proletariat that now exist within the confines of a single state. 
 Mr. 
 Lev Yurkevich, who calls himself a “Marxist” (poor Marx!), is an example of that silly policy. 
 In 1906, Sokolov-sky (Basok) and Lukashevich (Tuchapsky) asserted, Mr. 
Yurkevich writes, that the Ukrainian proletariat had be-come completely Russified and needed no separate organisa-tion. 
 Without quoting a single fact bearing on the direct issue , Mr. 
 Yurkevich falls upon both for saying this and cries out hysterically—quite in the spirit of the basest, moststupid and most reactionary nationalism—that this is“national passivity”, “national renunciation”, that these men have “split [!!] the Ukrainian Marxists”, and so forth. 
 Today, despite the “growth of Ukrainian national conscious-ness among the workers”, the minority of the workers are “nationally conscious”, while the majority, Mr. 
 Yurkevichassures us, “are still under the influence of Russian culture”. 
And it is our duty, this nationalist philistine exclaims, “not to follow the masses, but to lead them, to explain to them their national aims ( natsionalna sprava )” (Dzvin , p. 
 89). 
 This argument of Mr. 
 Yurkevich’s is wholly bourgeois-nationalistic. 
 But even from the point of view of the bour-geois nationalists, some of whom stand for complete equality and autonomy for the Ukraine, while others stand for an independent Ukrainian state, this argument will not wash. 
The Ukrainians’ striving for liberation is opposed by the Great-Russian and Polish landlord class and by the bourgeoi-sie of these two nations. 
 What social force is capable of standing up to these classes? The first decade of the twentieth century provided an actual reply to this question: thatforce is none other than the working class, which rallies thedemocratic peasantry behind it. 
 By striving to divide, andthereby weaken, the genuinely democratic force, whosevictory would make national oppression impossible, Mr. 
 Yurkevich is betraying, not only the interests of democracy in general, but also the interests of his own country, theUkraine. 
 Given united action by the Great-Russian andUkrainian proletarians, a free Ukraine is possible ; without such unity, it is out of the question. 
 But Marxists do not confine themselves to the bourgeois-national standpoint. 
 For several decades a well-defined process of accelerated economic development has beengoing on in the South, i. 
e. 
, the Ukraine, attracting hun-dreds of thousands of peasants and workers from Great Russiato the capitalist farms, mines, and cities. 
 The “assimila-tion”—within these limits—of the Great-Russian and Ukrainian proletariat is an indisputable fact. 
 And this fact is undoubtedly progressive. 
 Capitalism is replacing the ignorant, conservative, settled muzhik of the Great-Russianor Ukrainian backwoods with a mobile proletarian whoseconditions of life break down specifically national narrow-mindedness, both Great-Russian and Ukrainian. 
 Even if we assume that, in time, there will be a state frontier be-tween Great Russia and the Ukraine, the historically progres-sive nature of the “assimilation” of the Great-Russian andUkrainian workers will be as undoubted as the progressivenature of the grinding down of nations in America. 
 Thefreer the Ukraine and Great Russia become, the more extensive and more rapid will be the development of capital-ism, which will still more powerfully attract the workers,the working masses of all nations from all regions of the state and from all the neighbouring states (should Russiabecome a neighbouring state in relation to the Ukraine) tothe cities, the mines, and the factories. 
 Mr. 
 Lev Yurkevich acts like a real bourgeois, and a short-sighted, narrow-minded, obtuse bourgeois at that,i. 
e. 
, like a philistine, when he dismisses the benefits to be gained from the intercourse, amalgamation and assimila-tion of the proletariat of the two nations, for the sake of the momentary success of the Ukrainian national cause (sprava ). 
 The national cause comes first and the proletarian cause second, the bourgeois nationalists say, with the Yur-keviches, Dontsovs and similar would-be Marxists repeat-ing it after them. 
 The proletarian cause must come first,we say, because it not only protects the lasting and funda-mental interests of labour and of humanity, but also those of democracy; and without democracy neither an autonomousnor an independent Ukraine is conceivable. 
 Another point to be noted in Mr. 
 Yurkevich’s argument, which is so extraordinarily rich in nationalist gems, is this: theminority of Ukrainian workers are nationally conscious, he says; “the majority are still under the influence of Russian culture” ( bilshist perebuvaye shche pid vplyvom rosiiskoi kultury ). 
 Contraposing Ukrainian culture as a whole to Great-Russian culture as a whole, when speaking of the proletar-iat, is a gross betrayal of the proletariat’s interests for the benefit of bourgeois nationalism. 
 There are two nations in every modern nation—we say to all nationalist-socialists. 
 There are two national culturesin every national culture. 
 There is the Great-Russian cul-ture of the Purishkeviches, Guchkovs and Struves—butthere is also the Great-Russian culture typified in the names of Chernyshevsky and Plekhanov. 
 There are the same two cultures in the Ukraine as there are in Germany, in France, in England, among the Jews, and so forth. 
 Ifthe majority of the Ukrainian workers are under the influ-ence of Great-Russian culture, we also know definitelythat the ideas of Great-Russian democracy and Social-Democracy operate parallel with the Great-Russian clerical and bourgeois culture. 
 In fighting the latter kind of “cul-ture”, the Ukrainian Marxist will always bring the former into focus, and say to his workers: “We must snatch at,make use of, and develop to the utmost every opportunityfor intercourse with the Great-Russian class-conscious workers, with their literature and with their range of ideas; the fundamental interests of both the Ukrainian and the Great-Russian working-class movements demand it. 
” If a Ukrainian Marxist allows himself to be swayed by his quite legitimate and natural hatred of the Great-Russian oppressors to such a degree that he transfers even a particle of this hatred, even if it be only estrangement, tothe proletarian culture and proletarian cause of the Great-Russian workers, then such a Marxist will get bogged downin bourgeois nationalism. 
 Similarly, the Great-RussianMarxists will be bogged down, not only in bourgeois, but also in Black-Hundred nationalism, if he loses sight, even for a moment, of the demand for complete equality for theUkrainians, or of their right to form an independent state. 
 The Great-Russian and Ukrainian workers must work together, and, as long as they live in a single state, actin the closest organisational unity and concert, towards a common or international culture of the proletarian move-ment, displaying absolute tolerance in the question of thelanguage in which propaganda is conducted, and in thepurely local or purely national details of that propaganda. 
 This is the imperative demand of Marxism. 
 All advocacy ofthe segregation of the workers of one nation from those of another, all attacks upon Marxist “assimilation”, or at-tempts, where the proletariat is concerned, to contraposeone national culture as a whole to another allegedly inte-gral national culture, and so forth, is bourgeois nationalism, against which it is essential to wage a ruthless struggle. 
 4. 
 “CULTURAL-NATIONAL AUTONOMY” The question of the “national culture” slogan is of enor-mous importance to Marxists, not only because it determinesthe ideological content of all our propaganda and agita-tion on the national question, as distinct from bourgeois propaganda, but also because the entire programme of the much-discussed cultural-national autonomy is based onthis slogan. 
 The main and fundamental law in this programme is that it aims at introducing the most refined, most absoluteand most extreme nationalism. 
 The gist of this programme is that every citizen registers as belonging to a particular nation, and every nation constitutes a legal entity withthe right to impose compulsory taxation on its members, with national parliaments (Diets) and national secretaries of state (ministers). 
 Such an idea, applied to the national question, resem-bles Proudhon’s idea, as applied to capitalism. 
 Not ab-olishing capitalism and its basis—commodity production—but purging that basis of abuses, of excrescences, and so forth; not abolishing exchange and exchange value, but,on the contrary, making it “constitutional”, universal, absolute, “ fair”, and free of fluctuations, crises and abuses—such was Proudhon’s idea. 
 Just as Proudhon was petty-bourgeois, and his theory converted exchange and commodity production into anabsolute category and exalted them as the acme of perfec-tion, so is the theory and programme of “cultural-national autonomy” petty bourgeois, for it converts bourgeois nation-alism into an absolute category, exalts it as the acme ofperfection, and purges it of violence, injustice, etc. 
 Marxism cannot be reconciled with nationalism, be it even of the “most just”, “purest”, most refined and civilisedbrand. 
 In place of all forms of nationalism Marxism ad-vances internationalism, the amalgamation of all nations in the higher unity, a unity that is growing before our eyeswith every mile of railway line that is built, with everyinternational trust, and every workers’ association that isformed (an association that is international in its economicactivities as well as in its ideas and aims). 
 The principle of nationality is historically inevitable in bourgeois society and, taking this society into due account,the Marxist fully recognises the historical legitimacy ofnational movements. 
 But to prevent this recognition frombecoming an apologia of nationalism, it must be strictlylimited to what is progressive in such movements, in order that this recognition may not lead to bourgeois ideology obscuring proletarian consciousness. 
 The awakening of the masses from feudal lethargy, and their struggle against all national oppression, for the sov-ereignty of the people, of the nation, are progressive. 
 Hence,it is the Marxist’s bounden duty to stand for the most resolute and consistent democratism on all aspects of the national question. 
 This task is largely a negative one. 
 But this isthe limit the proletariat can go to in supporting nationalism, for beyond that begins the “positive” activity of the bour-geoisie striving to fortify nationalism. 
 To throw off the feudal yoke, all national oppression, and all privileges enjoyed by any particular nation or language,is the imperative duty of the proletariat as a democraticforce, and is certainly in the interests of the proletarianclass struggle, which is obscured and retarded by bickering onthe national question. 
 But to go beyond these strictly limit-ed and definite historical limits in helping bourgeois nation-alism means betraying the proletariat and siding with thebourgeoisie. 
 There is a border-line here, which is often veryslight and which the Bundists and Ukrainian nationalist-socialists completely lose sight of. 
 Combat all national oppression? Yes, of course! Fight for any kind of national development, for “national culture” in general?—Of course not. 
 The economic development ofcapitalist society presents us with examples of immaturenational movements all over the world, examples of theformation of big nations out of a number of small ones, orto the detriment of some of the small ones, and also exam-ples of the assimilation of nations. 
 The development of nation-ality in general is the principle of bourgeois nationalism;hence the exclusiveness of bourgeois nationalism, hence theendless national bickering. 
 The proletariat, however, farfrom undertaking to uphold the national development ofevery nation, on the contrary, warns the masses against such illusions, stands for the fullest freedom of capitalist intercourse and welcomes every kind of assimilation ofnations, except that which is founded on force or privi-lege. 
 Consolidating nationalism within a certain “justly” deli-mited sphere, “constitutionalising” nationalism, and securing the separation of all nations from one another by means of a special state institution—such is the ideological foundationand content of cultural-national autonomy. 
 This idea isthoroughly bourgeois and thoroughly false. 
 The proletariatcannot support any consecration of nationalism; on thecontrary, it supports everything that helps to obliterate national distinctions and remove national barriers; it supports everything that makes the ties between nation-alities closer and closer, or tends to merge nations. 
 To act differently means siding with reactionary nationalist philistinism. 
 When, at their Congress in Brünn11 (in 1899), the Aus-trian Social-Democrats discussed the plan for cultural-national autonomy, practically no attention was paid to atheoretical appraisal of that plan. 
 It is, however, note-worthy that the following two arguments were levelledagainst this programme: (1) it would tend to strengthen cler-icalism; (2) “its result would be the perpetuation of chau-vinism, its introduction into every small community, intoevery small group” (p. 
 92 of the official report of the BrünnCongress, in German. 
 A Russian translation was publishedby the Jewish nationalist party, the J. 
S. 
L. 
P. 
 12). 
 There can be no doubt that “national culture”, in the ordinary sense of the term, i. 
e. 
, schools, etc. 
, is at present under the predominant influence of the clergy and thebourgeois chauvinists in all countries in the world. 
 Whenthe Bundists, in advocating “cultural-national” autonomy,say that the constituting of nations will keep the class strug-gle within them clean of all extraneous considerations, then that is manifest and ridiculous sophistry. 
 It is primarily in the economic and political sphere that a serious classstruggle is waged in any capitalist society. 
 To separate thesphere of education from this is, firstly, absurdly utopian, because schools (like “national culture” in general) cannot beseparated from economics and politics; secondly, it is the economic and political life of a capitalist country that necessitates at every step the smashing of the absurd and outmoded national barriers and prejudices, whereas separa-tion of the school system and the like, would only perpetu-ate, intensify and strengthen “pure” clericalism and “pure”bourgeois chauvinism. 
 On the boards of joint-stock companies we find capi-talists of different nations sitting together in completeharmony. 
 At the factories workers of different nations workside by side. 
 In any really serious and profound politicalissue sides are taken according to classes, not nations. 
 With-drawing school education and the like from state control and placing it under the control of the nations is in effect an attempt to separate from economics, which unites the na-tions, the most highly, so to speak, ideological sphere of social iife, the sphere in which “pure” national culture or the nation-al cultivation of clericalism and chauvinism has the freest play. 
 In practice, the plan for “extra-territorial” or “cultural-national” autonomy could mean only one thing: the division of educational affairs according to nationality , i. 
e. 
, the introduction of national curias in school affairs. 
 Sufficientthought to the real significance of the famous Bund plan will enable one to realise how utterly reactionary it is even from the standpoint of democracy, let alone from that ofthe proletarian class struggle for socialism. 
 A single instance and a single scheme for the “nation-alisation” of the school system will make this point abun-dantly clear. 
 In the United States of America the division of the States into Northern and Southern holds to this day in all departments of life; the former possess the greatesttraditions of freedom and of struggle against the slave-own-ers; the latter possess the greatest traditions of slave-ownership, survivals of persecution of the Negroes, who areeconomically oppressed and culturally backward (44 per cent of Negroes are illiterate, and 6 per cent of whites), and so forth. 
 In the Northern States Negro children attendthe same schools as white children do. 
 In the South thereare separate “national”, or racial, whichever you please,schools for Negro children. 
 I think that this is the soleinstance of actual “nationalisation” of schools. 
 In Eastern Europe there exists a country where things like the Beilis case 13 are still possible, and Jews are con-demned by the Purishkeviches to a condition worse than thatof the Negroes. 
 In that country a scheme for nationalising Jewish schools was recently mooted in the Ministry. 
 Happi-ly, this reactionary utopia is no more likely to be realised than the utopia of the Austrian petty bourgeoisie, who have despaired of achieving consistent democracy or of puttingan end to national bickering, and have invented for thenations school-education compartments to keep them from bickering over the distribution of schools ... but have “consti-tuted” themselves for an eternal bickering of one “national culture” with another. 
 In Austria, the idea of cultural-national autonomy has re-mained largely a flight of literary fancy, which the Austrian Social-Democrats themselves have not taken seriously. 
 In Russia, however, it has been incorporated in the pro-grammes of all the Jewish bourgeois parties, and of several petty-bourgeois, opportunist elements in the different na-tions—for example, the Bundists, the liquidators in theCaucasus, and the conference of Russian national partiesof the Left-Narodnik trend. 
 (This conference, we willmention parenthetically, took place in 1907, its decision being adopted with abstention on the part of the Russian Socialist-Revolutionaries 14 and the P. 
S. 
P. 
,15 the Polish social-patriots. 
 Abstention from voting is a method sur-prisingly characteristic of the Socialist-Revolutionariesand P. 
S. 
P. 
, when they want to show their attitude towardsa most important question of principle in the sphere of the national programme!) In Austria it was Otto Bauer, the principal theoretician of “cultural-national autonomy”, who devoted a specialchapter of his book to prove that such a programme cannotpossibly be proposed for the Jews. 
 In Russia, however, itis precisely among the Jews that all the bourgeois parties— and the Bund which echoes them—have adopted this pro-gramme. 
 * What does this go to show? It goes to show that history, through the political practice of another state, hasexposed the absurdity of Bauer’s invention, in exactly thesame way as the Russian Bernsteinians (Struve, Tugan-Baranovsky, Berdayev and Co. 
), through their rapid evolu-*That the Bundists often vehemently deny that all the Jewish bourgeois parties have accepted “cultural-national autonomy” isunderstandable. 
 This fact only too glaringly exposes the actual rolebeing played by the Bund. 
 When Mr. 
 Manin, a Bundist, tried, in Luch , 16 to repeat his denial, he was fully exposed by N. 
 Skop (see Prosve-shcheniye No. 
 317) But when Mr. 
 Lev Yurkevich, in Dzvin (1913, Nos. 
 7-8, p. 
 92), quotes from Prosveshcheniye (No. 
 3, p. 
 78) N. 
 Sk. 
’s state-ment that “the Bundists together with all the Jewish bourgeois par-ties and groups have long been advocating cultural-national auton-omy” and distorts this statement by dropping the word “Bundists” and substituting the words “national rights” for the words “cultural-national autonomy”, one can only raise one’s hands in amazement!Mr. 
 Lev Yurkevich is not only a nationalist, not only an astonishingignoramus in matters concerning the history of the Social-Democratsand their programme, but a downright falsifier of quotations for the benefit of the Bund. 
 The affairs of the Bund and the Yurkeviches must be in a bad way indeed! tion from Marxism to liberalism, have exposed the real ideological content of the German Bernsteinism. 
18 Neither the Austrian nor the Russian Social-Democrats have incorporated “cultural-national” autonomy in theirprogramme. 
 However, the Jewish bourgeois parties in amost backward country, and a number of petty-bourgeois,so-called socialist groups have adopted it in order to spread ideas of bourgeois nationalism among the working class in a refined form. 
 This fact speaks for itself. 
 Since we have had to touch upon the Austrian programme on the national question, we must reassert a truth whichis often distorted by the Bundists. 
 At the Brünn Congress a pure programme of “cultural-national autonomy” was pre-sented. 
 This was the programme of the South-Slav Social-Democrats, §2 of which reads: “Every nation living inAustria, irrespective of the territory occupied by its mem-bers, constitutes an autonomous group which manages allits national (language and cultural) affairs quite independ-ently. 
” This programme was supported, not only by Kristan but by the influential Ellenbogen. 
 But it was withdrawn;not a single vote was cast for it. 
 A territorialist programme was adopted, i. 
e. 
, one that did not create any national groups “irrespective of the territory occupied by the mem-bers of the nation”. 
 Clause 3 of the adopted programme reads: “The self-govern-ing regions of one and the same nation shall jointly form a nationally united association, which shall manage itsnational affairs on an absolutely autonomous basis” (cf. 
Prosveshcheniye , 1913, No. 
 4, p. 
 28 19). 
 Clearly, this compro-mise programme is wrong too. 
 An example will illustrate this. 
 The German colonists’ community in Saratov Guber-nia, plus the German working-class suburb of Riga orLodz, plus the German housing estate near St. 
 Petersburg,etc. 
, would constitute a “nationally united association”of Germans in Russia. 
 Obviously the Social-Democratscannot demand such a thing or enforce such an associa-tion, although of course they do not in the least deny free-dom of every kind of association, including associations of any communities of any nationality in a given state. 
 The segregation, by a law of the state, of Germans, etc. 
, in different localities and of different classes in Russia into a single German-national association may be practised by anybody—priests, bourgeois or philistines, but not bySocial-Democrats. 
 5. 
 THE EQUALITY OF NATIONS AND THE RIGHTS OF NATIONAL MINORITIES When they discuss the national question, opportunists in Russia are given to citing the example of Austria. 
 Inmy article in Severnaya Pravda * (No. 
 10, Prosveshcheniye , pp. 
 96-98), which the opportunists have attacked (Mr. 
Semkovsky in Novaya Rabochaya Gazeta , 20 and Mr. 
 Lieb-man in Zeit ), I asserted that, insofar as that is at all possi-ble under capitalism, there was only one solution of thenational question, viz. 
, through consistent democracy. 
 Inproof of this, I referred, among other things, to Switzer-land. 
 This has not been to the liking of the two opportunists mentioned above, who are trying to refute it or belittle its significance. 
 Kautsky, we are told, said that Switzerlandis an exception; Switzerland, if you please, has a specialkind of decentralisation, a special history, special geograph-ical conditions, unique distribution of a population thatspeak different languages, etc. 
, etc. 
 All these are nothing more than attempts to evade the issue. 
 To be sure, Switzerland is an exception in that sheis not a single-nation state. 
 But Austria and Russia arealso exceptions (or are backward, as Kautsky adds). 
 To besure, it was only her special, unique historical and socialconditions that ensured Switzerland greater democracy than most of her European neighbours. 
 But where does all this come in, if we are speaking of the model to be adopted? In the whole world, under present-day conditions, countries in which any particular institutionhas been founded on consistent democratic principles are the exception. 
 Does this prevent us, in our programme, from upholding consistent democracy in all institutions? *See pp. 
 20-22 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 Switzerland’s special features lie in her history, her geo-graphical and other conditions. 
 Russia’s special features lie in the strength of her proletariat, which has no precedent in the epoch of bourgeois revolutions, and in her shockinggeneral backwardness, which objectively necessitates anexceptionally rapid and resolute advance, under the threatof all sorts of drawbacks and reverses. 
 We are evolving a national programme from the prole-tarian standpoint; since when has it been recommended that the worst examples, rather than the best, be taken as amodel? At all events, does it not remain an indisputable and undisputed fact that national peace under capitalism hasbeen achieved (insofar as it is achievable) exclusively in countries where consistent democracy prevails? Since this is indisputable, the opportunists’ persistent references to Austria instead of Switzerland are nothing buta typical Cadet device, for the Cadets 21 always copy the worst European constitutions rather than the best. 
 In Switzerland there are three official languages, but bills submitted to a referendum are printed in five lan-guages, that is to say, in two Romansh dialects, in additionto the three official languages. 
 According to the 1900 census,these two dialects are spoken by 38,651 out of the 3,315,443inhabitants of Switzerland, i. 
e. 
, by a little over one per cent . 
 In the army, commissioned and non-comissioned officers “are given the fullest freedom to speak to the men in their native language”. 
 In the cantons of Graubündenand Wallis (each with a population of a little over a hundredthousand) both dialects enjoy complete equality. 
 * The question is: should we advocate and support this, the living experience of an advanced country, or borrow from the Austrians inventions like “extra-territorial auton-omy”, which have not yet been tried out anywhere in theworld (and not yet been adopted by the Austrians them-selves)? To advocate this invention is to advocate the division of school education according to nationality, and that is a downright harmful idea. 
 The experience of Switzerland *See René Henry: La Suisse et la question des langues , Berne, 1907. 
 proves, however, that the greatest (relative) degree of national peace can be , and has been , ensured in practice where you have a consistent (again relative) democracy throughout the state. 
 “In Switzerland,” say people who have studied this question, “there is no national question in the East-European sense of the term. 
 The very phrase (national question) is unknown there .... 
” “Sw itzer-land left the struggle between nationalities a long way behind, in 1797-1803. 
” * This means that the epoch of the great French Revolu-tion, which provided the most democratic solution of thecurrent problems of the transition from feudalism to capital-ism, succeeded incidentally, en passant , in “ solving ” the national question. 
 Let the Semkovskys, Liebmans, and other opportunists now try to assert that this “exclusively Swiss” solution isinapplicable to any uyezd or even part of an uyezd in Russia, where out of a population of only 200,000 forty thousandspeak two dialects and want to have complete equality of language in their area! Advocacy of complete equality of nations and languages distinguishes only the consistently democratic elements ineach nation (i. 
e. 
, only the proletarians), and unites them, not according to nationality, but in a profound and earnestdesire to improve the entire system of state. 
 On the contrary,advocacy of “cultural-national autonomy”, despite the pious wishes of individuals and groups, divides the nations and in fact draws the workers and the bourgeoisie of anyone nation closer together (the adoption of this “cultural-national autonomy” by all the Jewish bourgeois parties). 
 Guaranteeing the rights of a national minority is insep-arably linked up with the principle of complete equality. 
 In my article in Severnaya Pravda this principle was ex-pressed in almost the same terms as in the later, official andmore accurate decision of the conference of Marxists. 
 Thatdecision demands “the incorporation in the constitution ofa fundamental law which shall declare null and void allprivileges enjoyed by any one nation and all infringements of the rights of a national minority”. 
 *See Ed. 
 Blocher: Die Nationalitäten in der Schweiz , Berlin, 1910. 
 Mr. 
 Liebman tries to ridicule this formula and asks: “Who knows what the rights of a national minority are?” Do these rights, he wants to know, include the right of the minority to have “its own programme” for the nationalschools? How large must the national minority be to havethe right to have its own judges, officials, and schoolswith instruction in his own language? Mr. 
 Liebman wantsit to be inferred from these questions that a “ positive ” national programme is essential. 
 Actually, these questions clearly show what reactionary ideas our Bundist tries to smuggle through under cover of adispute on supposedly minor details and particulars. 
 “Its own programme” in its national schools!... Marxists, my dear nationalist-socialist, have a general school pro-gramme which demands, for example, an absolutely secular school. 
 As far as Marxists are concerned, no departure from this general programme is anywhere or at any time permis-sible in a democratic state (the question of introducing any“local” subjects, languages, and so forth into it being decidedby the local inhabitants). 
 However, from the principle of “taking educational affairs out of the hands of the state” and placing them under the control of the nations, it ensuesthat we, the workers, must allow the “nations” in our demo-cratic state to spend the people’s money on clerical schools!Without being aware of the fact, Mr. 
 Liebman has clearlydemonstrated the reactionary nature of “cultural-national autonomy”! “How large must a national minority be?” This is not defined even in the Austrian programme, of which theBundists are enamoured. 
 It says (more briefly and lessclearly than our programme does): “The rights of the nation-al minorities are protected by a special law to be passed by the Imperial Parliament” (§4 of the Brünn programme). 
 Why has nobody asked the Austrian Social-Democrats the question: what exactly is that law, and exactly whichrights and of which minority is it to protect? That is because all sensible people understand that it is inappropriate and impossible to define particulars in a pro-gramme. 
 A programme lays down only fundamental prin-ciples. 
 In this case the fundamental principle is implied withthe Austrians, and directly expressed in the decision of the latest conference of Russian Marxists. 
 That principle is: no national privileges and no national inequality. 
 Let us take a concrete example to make the point clear to the Bundist. 
 According to the schoal census of January 18, 1911, St. 
 Petersburg elementary schools under the Ministry of Public “Education” were attended by 48,076pupils. 
 Of these, 396, i. 
e. 
, less than one per cent, were Jews. 
 The other figures are: Rumanian pupils—2, Geor-gians—1, Armenians—3, etc. 
 22 Is it possible to draw up a “positive” national programme that will cover this diver-sity of relationships and conditions? (And St. 
 Petersburg is, of course, far from being the city with the most mixed population in Russia. 
) Even such specialists in national“subtleties” as the Bundists would hardly be able to draw up) such a programme. 
 And yet, if the constitution of the country contained a fundamental law rendering null and void every measurethat infringed the rights of a minority, any citizen wouldbe able to demand the rescinding of orders prohibiting, forexample, the hiring, at state expense, of special teachers of Hebrew, Jewish history, and the like, or the provision of state-owned premises for lectures for Jewish, Armenian,or Rumanian children, or even for the one Georgian child. 
At all events, it is by no means impossible to meet, on thebasis of equality, all the reasonable and just wishes of thenational minorities, and nobody will say that advocacy of equality is harmful. 
 On the other hand, it would certainly be harmful to advocate division of schools according tonationality, to advocate, for example, special schoolsfor Jewish children in St. 
 Petersburg, and it would be utterlyimpossible to set up national schools for every national minority, for one, two or three children. 
 Furthermore, it is impossible, in any country-wide law, to define how large a national minority must he to be en-titled to special schools, or to special teachers for supple-mentary subjects, etc. 
 On the other hand, a country-wide law establishing equality can be worked out in detail and developed through special regulations and the decisions of regional Diets, and town, Zemstvo, village commune and other author-ities. 
 6. 
 CENTRALISATION AND AUTONOMY In his rejoinder, Mr. 
 Liebman writes: “Take our Lithuania, the Baltic province, Poland, Volhynia, South Russia, etc. 
—everywhere you will find a mixed population; there is not a single city that does not have a large national minority. 
However far decentralisation is carried out, different nationalities will always be found living together in different places (chiefly in urban communities), and it is democratism that surrenders a nationalminority to the national majority. 
 But, as we know, V. 
 I. 
 is opposed to the federal state structure and the boundless decentralisation that exist in the Swiss Federation. 
 The question is: what was his pointin citing the example of Switzerland?” My object in citing the example of Switzerland has already been explained above. 
 I have also explained that the prob-lem of protecting the rights of a national minority can besolved only by a country-wide law promulgated in a con-sistently democratic state that does not depart from theprinciple of equality. 
 But in the passage quoted above, Mr. 
 Liebman repeats still another of the most common (and most fallacious) arguments (or sceptical remarks) which areusually made against the Marxist national programme, andwhich, therefore, deserve examination. 
 Marxists are, of course, opposed to federation and decen-tralisation, for the simple reason that capitalism requires for its development the largest and most centralised possible states. 
 Other conditions being equal , the class-conscious proletariat will always stand for the larger state. 
 It willalways fight against medieval particularism, and will al-ways welcome the closest possible economic amalgamationof large territories in which the proletariat’s struggle against the bourgeoisie can develop on a broad basis. 
 Capitalism’s broad and rapid development of the pro-ductive forces calls for large, politically compact and united territories, since only here can the bourgeois class—togetherwith its inevitable antipode, the proletarian class—uniteand sweep away all the old, medieval, caste, parochial, petty-national, religious and other barriers. 
 The right of nations to self-determination, i. 
e. 
, the right to secede and form independent national states, will bedealt with elsewhere. 
 * But while, and insofar as, different *See pp. 
 393-454 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 nations constitute a single state, Marxists will never, under any circumstances, advocate either the federal principle or decentralisation. 
 The great centralised state is a tremendous historical step forward from medieval disunity to the futuresocialist unity of the whole world, and only via such a state (inseparably connected with capitalism), can there be any road to socialism. 
 It would, however, be inexcusable to forget that in advo-cating centralism we advocate exclusively democratic cen-tralism. 
 On this point all the philistines in general, and thenationalist philistines in particular (including the lateDragomanov 23), have so confused the issue that we are obliged again and again to spend time clarifying it. 
 Far from precluding local self-government, with auton-omy for regions having special economic and social condi-tions, a distinct national composition of the population,and so forth, democratic centralism necessarily demandsboth . 
 In Russia centralism is constantly confused with tyranny and bureaucracy. 
 This confusion has naturallyarisen from the history of Russia, but even so it is quite inexcusable for a Marxist to yield to it. 
 This can best be explained by a concrete example. 
In her lengthy article “The National Question and Auton-omy”, * Rosa Luxemburg, among many other curious errors (which we shall deal with below), commits the exceptionallycurious one of trying to restrict the demand for autonomy to Poland alone. 
 But first let us see how she defines autonomy. 
 Rosa Luxemburg admits—and being a Marxist she is of course bound to admit—that all the major and importanteconomic and political questions of capitalist society mustbe dealt with exclusively by the central parliament of the whole country concerned, not by the autonomous Diets of the individual regions. 
 These questions include tariff policy,laws governing commerce and industry, transport andmeans of communication (railways, post, telegraph, tele-phone, etc. 
), the army, the taxation system, civil ** and crim-*Przegl Zd Socjaldemokratyczny ,24 Kraków, 1908 and 1909. 
 **In elaborating her ideas Rosa Luxemburg goes into details, mentioning, for example—and quite rightly—divorce laws (No. 
 12, p. 
 162 of the above-mentioned journal). 
 inal law, the general principles of education (for example, the law on purely secular schools, on universal education, on the minimum programme, on democratic school manage-ment, etc. 
), the labour protection laws, and political liber-ties (right of association), etc. 
, etc. 
 The autonomous Diets—on the basis of the general laws of the country—should deal with questions of purely local,regional, or national significance. 
 Amplifying this idea in great—not to say excessive—detail, Rosa Luxemburg men-tions, for example, the construction of local railways(No. 
 12, p. 
 149) and local highways (No. 
 14-15, p. 
 376),etc. 
 Obviously, one cannot conceive of a modern, truly demo-cratic state that did not grant such autonomy to every region having any appreciably distinct economic and social fea-tures, populations of a specific national composition, etc. 
 Theprinciple of centralism, which is essential for the develop-ment of capitalism, is not violated by this (local and region-al) autonomy, but on the contrary is applied by it demo-cratically , not bureaucratically. 
 The broad, free and rapid development of capitalism would be impossible, or at least greatly impeded, by the absence of such autonomy, which facilitates the concentration of capital, the development of the productive forces, the unity of the bourgeoisie and theunity of the proletariat on a country-wide scale; for bureau-cratic interference in purely local (regional, national, and other) questions is one of the greatest obstacles to economic and political development in general, and an obstacle tocentralism in serious, important and fundamental matters in particular. 
 One cannot help smiling, therefore, when reading how our magnificent Rosa Luxemburg tries to prove, with a very serious air and “purely Marxist” phrases, that the demand for autonomy is applicable only to Poland and only by way of exception! Of course, there is not a grain of “parochial”patriotism in this; we have here only “practical” considera-tions ... in the case of Lithuania, for example. 
 Rosa Luxemburg takes four gubernias—Vilna, Kovno, Grodno and Suvalki—assuring her readers (and herself) that these are inhabited “mainly” by Lithuanians; and byadding the inhabitants of these gubernias together she finds that Lithuanians constitute 23 per cent of the total popula-tion, and if Zhmuds are added, they constitute 31 per cent—less than a third. 
 The natural inference is that the idea of autonomy for Lithuania is “arbitrary and artificial”(No. 
 10, p. 
 807). 
 The reader who is familiar with the commonly known defects of our Russian official statistics will quickly seeRosa Luxemburg’s mistake. 
 Why take Grodno Gubernia where the Lithuanians constitute only 0. 
2 per cent, one-fifth of one per cent , of the population? Why take the whole Vilna Gubernia and not its Troki Uyezd alone, where theLithuanians constitute the majority of the population? Why take the whole Suvalki Gubernia and put the numberof Lithuanians at 52 per cent of the population, and not the Lithuanian uyezds of that gubernia, i. 
e. 
, five out of the seven, in which Lithuanians constitute 72 per cent of the population? It is ridiculous to talk about the conditions and demands of modern capitalism while at the same time taking notthe “modern”, not the “capitalist”, but the medieval, feudal and official-bureaucratic administrative divisions of Russia, and in their crudest form at that (gubernias instead ofuyezds). 
 Plainly, there can be no question of any seriouslocal reform in Russia until these divisions are abolished andsuperseded by a really “modern” division that really meets the requirements, not of the Treasury, not of the bureaucracy, not of routine, not of the landlords, not of the priests, but of capitalism; and one of the modern requirements of capi-talism is undoubtedly the greatest possible national uni-formity of the population, for nationality and languageidentity are an important factor making for the completeconquest of the home market and for complete freedom of economic intercourse. 
 Oddly enough, this obvious mistake of Rosa Luxemburg’s is repeated by the Bundist Medem, who sets out to prove, notthat Poland’s specific features are “exceptional”, but thatthe principle of national-territorial autonomy is unsuitable(the Bundists stand for national extra-territorial autonomy!). 
 Our Bundists and liquidators collect from all over the world all the errors and all the opportunist vacillationsof Social-Democrats of different countries and different nations and appropriate to themselves the worst they can find in world Social-Democracy. 
 A scrap-book of Bundist and liquidator writings could, taken together, serve as a model Social-Democratic museum of bad taste . 
 Regional autonomy, Medem tells us didactically, is good for a region or a “territory”, but not for Lettish, Estonianor other areas ( okrugs ), which have populations ranging from half a million to two million and areas equal to a gubernia. 
 “That would not be autonomy , but simply a Zemstvo .... 
 Over this Zemstvo it would be necessary to establish real auton-omy” ... and the author goes on to condemn the “break-up”of the old gubernias and uyezds. 
 * As a matter of fact, the preservation of the medieval, feudal, official administrative divisions means the “break-up” and mutilation of the conditions of modern capitalism. 
 Only people imbued with the spirit of these divisions can,with the learned air of the expert, speculate on the contra-position of “Zemstvo” and “autonomy”, calling for the ster-eotyped application of “autonomy” to large regions andof the Zemstvo to small ones. 
 Modern capitalism does not demand these bureaucratic stereotypes at all. 
 Why national areas with populations, not only of half a million, but evenof 50,000, should not be able to enjoy autonomy; whysuch areas should not be able to unite in the most diverseways with neighbouring areas of different dimensions intoa single autonomous “territory” if that is convenient or neces-sary for economic intercourse—these things remain the secret of the Bundist Medem. 
 We would mention that the Brünn Social-Democratic national programme is based entirely on national-territo-rial autonomy; it proposes that Austria should be dividedinto “nationally distinct” areas “instead of the historical crown lands” (Clause 2 of the Brünn programme). 
 We would not go as far as that. 
 A uniform national population isundoubtedly one of the most reliable factors making forfree, broad and really modern commercial intercourse. 
 It isbeyond doubt that not a single Marxist, and not even a singlefirm democrat, will stand up for the Austrian crown lands *V. 
 Medem: “A Contribution to the Presentation of the National Question in Russia”, Vestnik Yevropy ,25 1912, Nos. 
 8 and 9. 
 and the Russian gubernias and uyezds (the latter are not as bad as the Austrian crown lands, but they are very bad nevertheless), or challenge the necessity of replacing these obsolete divisions by others that will conform as far as pos-sible with the national composition of the population. 
 Lastly,it is beyond doubt that in order to eliminate all nationaloppression it is very important to create autonomous areas,however small, with entirely homogeneous populations, towards which members of the respective nationalities scattered all over the country, or even all over the world,could gravitate, and with which they could enter into rela-tions and free associations of every kind. 
 All this is indispu-table, and can be argued against only from the hidebound,bureaucratic point of view. 
 The national composition of the population, however, is one of the very important economic factors, but not the sole and not the most important factor. 
 Towns, for example, play an extremely important economic role under capitalism, and everywhere, in Poland, in Lithuania, in the Ukraine,in Great Russia, and elsewhere, the towns are marked by mixed populations. 
 To cut the towns off from the villages and areas that economically gravitate towards them, forthe sake of the “national” factor, would be absurd and impos-sible. 
 That is why Marxists must not take their stand en-tirely and exclusively on the “national-territorial” principle. 
 The solution of the problem proposed by the last con-ference of Russian Marxists is far more correct than the Aus-trian. 
 On this question, the conference advanced the follow-ing proposition: “... must provide for wide regional autonomy [not for Poland alone, of course, but for all the regions of Russia] * and fully demo-cratic local self-government, and the boundaries of the self-govern-ing and autonomous regions must be determined [not by the bounda-ries of the present gubernias, uyezds, etc. 
, but] by the local inhabitantsthemselves on the basis of their economic and social conditions,national make-up of the population, etc. 
” ** Here the national composition of the population is placed on the same level as the other conditions (economic first, *Interpolations in square brackets (within passages quoted by Lenin) are by Lenin, unless otherwise indicated. 
— Ed. 
 **See present edition, Vol. 
 19, pp. 
 427-28. 
— Ed. 
 then social, etc. 
) which must serve as a basis for determining the new boundaries that will meet the needs of modern capi-talism, not of bureaucracy and Asiatic barbarism. 
 The local population alone can “assess” those conditions with fullprecision, and on that basis the central parliament of thecountry will determine the boundaries of the autonomousregions and the powers of autonomous Diets. 
 * * * We have still to examine the question of the right of nations to self-determination. 
 On this question a wholecollection of opportunists of all nationalities—the liquidatorSemkovsky, the Bundist Liebman and the Ukrainian nation-alist-socialist Lev Yurkevick—have set to work to “popu-larise” the errors of Rosa Luxemburg. 
 This question, whichhas been so utterly confused by this whole “collection”, willbe dealt with in our next article. 
 26 ONCE MORE ABOUT THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIALIST BUREAU AND THE LIQUIDATORS The characteristic feature of the publicists of the Novaya Likvidatorskaya Gazeta , namely, hypocrisy goaded on by impotent malice, has never reached such limits as it has in their articles concerning the decision of the InternationalBureau. 
 27 To what lengths they have gone can be seen from the fact that, after their very first articles on this subject, Huys-mans, the Secretary of the International Socialist Bureau, felt constrained to authorise Comrade Popov to convey to the Russian workers his protest against the attempts ofNovaya Rabochaya Gazeta to “exploit, in its factional inter-ests, the lack of information” of the Russian readers, hisprotest against the “utter inaccuracy and disloyalty” of theliquidators’ published reports concerning the Bureau’s deci-sions. 
 Since the Novaya Rabochaya Gazeta publicists have re-ceived such a resounding ... testimonial from the Bureau’sSecretary, we can calmly ignore their attempts to accuse us of distorting the true character of the decisions passed inLondon. 
 People who have been publicly accused by the Secretary of the Bureau of “exploiting” the Bureau’s deci-sions “in their factional interests” and of being “disloyal”to them, may shout as much as they please about their re-spect for the International, etc. 
, but scarcely anyone willbelieve them. 
 Every worker knows now what name to givethe manipulations by which Mr. 
 D. 
 28 tries so hard to read into the resolution of the Bureau such things as “the methods of building” the Party, “condemnation” of the Six,29 “rejec-tion” of our “claims” and “recognition” of the Social-Demo-cratic character of the Left wing. 
30 Literary juggling with the resolutions of the Bureau is hardly a sign of respect for those resolutions, Mr. 
 D. 
! How great, though, is the confusion of these jugglers! See how they are forced to contradict themselves at every turn! 1) In No. 
 102, Mr. 
 D. 
 solemnly stated: “The International Socialist Bureau censured the six deputies for resigning from the Duma group. 
 In issue No. 
 104, another juggler, Mr. 
 L. 
 S. 
,31 no less solemnly declared: “The International Social-ist Bureau handed out neither testimonials nor censure . 
” And—please note!— both gentlemen are highly pleasedwith the Bureau’s decision; one because it “censured”, andthe other because it did not! Can one imagine a picture ofgreater confusion? Indeed, there was good reason for the liquidators’ con-fusion! The main point of the Bureau’s resolution statesunequivocally the following: “ Any practical step towards unity must be preceded by a preliminary clarification ofexisting differences . 
” This decision is a perfectly correct one. 
 If we do not want to present the working class with a hodgepodge of miscellaneous elements miscalled “unity”, andif we want real unity of action , the first obligatory step in this direction must be to ascertain exactly what the “pointsof disagreement” are. 
 Let us first ascertain exactly the“points of disagreement” by means of a “general exchange of opinion”, and then it will become clear whether it is possible to talk about any practical steps towards unity. 
That is how the question is formulated in the Bureau’sresolution. 
 We whole-heartedly approve of this formula-tion. 
 We responded to the proposal of the InternationalSocialist Bureau by calling upon the workers calmly and thoughtfully to discuss our disagreements once more, and to express their views on the points of disagreement. 
 We, forour part, promised to do all we could to help familiariseour foreign comrades with the existing differences. 
 Theresolution published in Proletarskaya Pravda , No. 
 9, gives a quite correct summary of the points on which we and the liquidators 32 disagree. 
 This is what our reply to the Bureau’s proposal should be, and of course, there couldbe no other line of action for those who have serious consideration for the Bureau’s decision to promote a “gen-eral exchange of opinion on the points of disagreement”. 
 But—and this is the whole point—no task is more un-pleasant, undesirable, and unacceptable to the liquidatorsthan that of ascertaining our main differences on questionsof theory, programme, tactics and organisation. 
 All theirsubterfuges, distortions and abuse in connection with theBureau’s resolution are solely designed to obscure its demand for a preliminary clarification of differences. 
 Both Mr. 
 L. 
 S. 
 and Mr. 
 D. 
 run ahead zealously: couldwe not somehow “unite” without “certificates” giving theideological “service record” of those uniting? Could we notdo without “quotations from old journals and newspapers”?—Mr. 
 L. 
 S. 
 worries. 
 Could we not stop recalling “the past”?— Mr. 
 D. 
 pleads. 
 We understand them very well: there is nothing pleasant for Mr. 
 L. 
 S. 
 in the recollections of articlesabout the “underground” ( Luch No. 
 15 [101]), or for Mr. 
 D. 
 in recollections of the “fight-for-legality” slogan. 
 And wefully endorse the Bureau’s decision insofar as it proposesthat the errors of the past should not be raked up. 
 We shall not deny the liquidators the amnesty for the “errors of the past”, for which they plead. 
 The past, as such, does notinterest us; what does interest us is the work of today andtomorrow. 
 As regards that work, we want to know whetherthe campaign against the “underground” conducted in theliquidationist press is to continue , whether they will contin-ue to argue that the “three pillars” 33 are inapplicable at the present time, whether they will defend the distortion ofthe programme by the August bloc people 34 and so forth. 
 The clarification of these questions and of the degree to which we differ on them is, according to the Bureau’s resolu-tion, a precondition to any progress towards unity, if we are not to accept “unity” in the liquidationist meaning of lump-ing together, without regard for principles, all who care tocall themselves Social-Democrats. 
 “The counts of the indictment have already been drawn up,” Mr. 
 L. 
 S. 
 thunders. 
 We should not like to recall herethe story about the thief who fears his own shadow, but why does Mr. 
 L. 
 S. 
 take ordinary peace terms to be an “indict-ment”? We say: the organisation to be created as a result ofunity should be based on such and such principles—accept-ance of the old programme, a definite form of organisation, uncurtailed slogans,35 resolute tactics, etc. 
 But you immedi-ately declare that this formulation of the programme, tactics and tasks of the organisation, is nothing but a “completelist of liquidators’ sins”. 
 We are sorry for you, but neitherwe nor the Bureau know of any method of building new organ-isations other than by clarifying their programme, theirtactics, and so forth. 
 We are guilty of a still more grievous sin, however. 
 Not only have we proposed the conditions for the creation of anorganisation, i. 
e. 
, clarified the terms of peace, but we have,moreover, submitted these terms to the bar of the workers’opinion. 
 We maintain that there is no other way of carrying out the Bureau’s decision than the one we have chosen. 
 The Bureau calls upon all those who profess to be Social-Democrats to clarify their differences as a preliminary steptowards solving the problem of unity. 
 The resolution we published responded to the Bureau’s appeal by giving a “list” of views on the basic questions of programme, tactics and organisation, and by submitting our “list” to the workers, for their consideration. 
 If the liqui-dators were to follow our example, we would have, in themore or less near future, the clearly formulated opinionsof all parties, and a clear idea as to which side has the supportof the majority of the organised workers. 
 The task set before the Russian proletariat by the International Socialist Bureau would be brought nearer to fulfilment. 
 But the liquidators,of course, will to the very last shun this path, for the simplereason that neither a precise formulation of their politicalviews nor the submission of these views to the bar of the broadcircles of the workers is in the interests of their group. 
 Under these circumstances they will inevitably strive to substitute for the definite “clarification of differences” demandedby the Bureau, petty personal squabbles, distortions, andwilful misrepresentations, which can only hamper its work,and they will constantly necessitate those lessons in “loyal-ty which the Secretary of the International has already been compelled to teach the liquidators. 
 Proletarskaya Pravda No. 
 11, Published according to December 19, 1913 the text in Proletarskaya Pravda NATIONAL -LIBERALISM AND THE RIGHT OF NATIONS TO SELF -DETERMINATION Coming to the aid of the muddled Mr. 
 Mogilyansky, the editors of the liberal Rech36 recently (in issue No. 
 340) published an unsigned, i. 
e. 
, official and editorial statement on an important issue, namely, the right of nations to self-determination. 
 Evading a direct answer, Mr. 
 Mogilyansky had asserted that his views had “nothing in common with the repudiationof the right of nations to self-determination”. 
 Now Rech officially declares that Clause 11 of the Constitutional-Demo-cratic Party programme gives a “direct, precise and clearanswer to the question of the right to free cultural self-determination”. 
 The word we have underlined is particularly important, since it was not “cultural” self-determination that was dis-cussed in Mr. 
 Mogilyansky’s first article, or in Mr. 
 Don-tsov’s reply to it, or in Mr. 
 Mogilyansky’s polemic withMr. 
 Dontsov. 
 The question discussed was the political self-determination of nations, i. 
e. 
, the right of nations to secede,whereas by “cultural self-determination” (a meaningless,pompous phrase, which contradicts the entire history of democracy) the liberals really mean only freedom of lan-guages. 
 Rech now declares that Proletarskaya Pravda hopelessly confuses self-determination with “separatism”, with seces-sion by a nation. 
 Which side is revealing hopeless (or perhaps deliberate...) confusion? Will our enlightened “Constitutional-Democrats” deny that, throughout the entire history of international democ-racy, and especially since the middle of the nineteenth cen-tury, self-determination of nations has been understood to mean precisely political self-determination, i. 
e. 
, the right to secede, to form an independent national state? Will our enlightened “Constitutional-Democrats” deny that the International Socialist Congress held in London in1896, in reaffirming the established democratic principle(to which, of course, the Congress did not confine itself) also had in mind political and not some sort of “cultural” self-determination? Will our enlightened “Constitutional-Democrats” deny that Plekhanov, for example, who wrote about self-deter-mination as far back as 1902, thereby understood politicalself-determination? Please, gentlemen, explain yourselves more clearly; do not conceal the fruits of your “enlightenment” from the“mob”! On the main issue Rech states: “Actually , the Cadets have never pledged themselves to advocate the right of ‘nations to secede ’ from the Russian state . 
” Splendid! Thank you for being so candid, and for making such an explicit statement of principles! We draw the at-tention of Rossiya , Novoye Vremya , Zemshchina , 37 and others, to this “most loyal” statement by the Cadets’ semi-official organ! But stay your ire, gentlemen of the Cadet Party, should you be called national-liberals precisely for that reason. 
 Herein lies one of the root causes of your chauvinism andof your ideological and political bloc with the Purishkeviches(or of your ideological and political dependence upon them). 
The Purishkeviches and their class inculcate in the ignorant masses the “firm” belief that it is “right” to “grab ’em and hold ’em”. 
 38 The Cadets have studied history and know only too well what—to put it mildly—“pogrom-like” actionsthe practice of this “ancient right” has often led to. 
 A demo-crat could not remain a democrat (let alone a proletariandemocrat) without systematically advocating, precisely among the Great-Russian masses and in the Russian lan-guage, the “self-determination” of nations in the politicaland not in the “cultural” sense. 
 Always and everywhere the characteristic feature of national-liberalism lies in its taking a stand entirely on the basis of relations (and boundaries) determined by the Purish-kevich class and protected (often to the detriment of eco-nomic development and of “culture”) by Purishkevich meth-ods. 
 In effect, this means adapting oneself to the interestsof the feudal-minded landlords and to the worst nationalistprejudices of the dominant nation, instead of systemati-cally combating those prejudices. 
 Proletarskaya Pravda No. 
 12, Published according to December 20, 1913 the text in Proletarskaya Pravda NARODISM AND LIQUIDATIONISM AS DISINTEGRATING ELEMENTS IN THE WORKING -CLASS MOVEMENT The St. 
 Petersburg Narodnik newspaper Severnaya Mysl39 recently published a report from Riga concerning the prog-ress of the insurance campaign. 
40 Among other things the author, B. 
 Braines, wrote: “The boycottist trend is apparent only among the shoemakers, where boycottist groups have been formed. 
 Unfortunately, the Na-rodniks are the leading spirits in these groups. 
 At the other factoriesthe campaign is making little headway. 
” This candid confession throws a strong light on the pres-ent condition and political significance of Narodism inRussia. 
 The correctness of the appraisal of Narodism made bythe conference of Marxists 41 is unexpectedly and strikingly confirmed by the Narodniks themselves. 
 Just think of it: a Left-Narodnik newspaper, unable to make any refutation whatsoever, publishes the regrets of its correspondent that the Narodniks are the “ leading spir-its” of the boycottist groups! Here is a splendid illustration of the political disintegra-tion of Narodism. 
 Here is an example of Russian non-party-ism and indifference to the party principle. 
 We must deal with this example, because an example from the life of “another” party reveals to us with striking clarity the truecause of an evil which is generally very widespread, andfrom which we suffer considerably. 
 During the period of counter-revolution a great variety of trends and groups, all practically independent of one another, arose among the Narodniks. 
 In this respect, both the Narodniks and the Marxists were evidently affected bythe operation of the general causes stemming from the entire historical situation created by the Third of June system. 
42 Among the Narodniks; individual groups came out in the press, for example, in a far more liquidationist vein than was the case with us (the Paris publications of 1908-10),and there were groups of quite an anarchist character, andthe most prominent writers of that trend began to talk andwrite like liberals and renegades (Mr. 
 V. 
 Chernov inZavety 43), and so forth. 
 Nevertheless, formally and outwardly, the Narodniks appear to be much more “ united ” than the Marxists are. 
 There is no definite split among the Narodniks, no intense,stubborn, systematic and prolonged inner struggle amongthem. 
 It seems, at first glance, as though they are all thetime held together by certain common ties. 
 In their litera-ture one constantly comes across proud references to Narod-nik “unity”, in contrast with the “Marxist” (and most often“Bolshevik”) “tendency towards discord and splits”. 
 Those who want to understand the meaning and signifi-cance of what is taking place in the working-class and so-cialist movements in Russia must ponder very, very care-fully over this contraposing of “Marxist splits” and “Narod-nik unity”. 
 Among us Marxists and near-Marxists there are also no few groups and grouplets which are practically almost inde-pendent of one another, and which sedulously preach “unity”(quite in the Narodnik spirit), and still more sedulously condemn “Marxist splits”. 
 What does it all mean? Are we to envy “Narodnik unity”? Are we to seek the reasons for this distinction in the per-nicious qualities of “certain” “leaders” (a very widespreadmethod) or in the Marxists’ pernicious tendency towards“dogmatism”, “intolerance”, and so forth? Consider the facts. 
 These tell us that the Narodniks are far more tolerant and conciliatory, that they are far more“united”, and that the abundance of groups among them doesnot lead to sharp splits. 
 At the same time the facts tell usquite incontrovertibly that the Narodniks are politicallyimpotent , that they have no organised or durable contacts with the masses, that they are incapable of any mass politi-cal action. 
 The example of the Narodnik boycottists in Rigamerely serves to illustrate most strikingly what was revealed /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR not only in the insurance campaign, but also in the Duma elections, the strike movement, the working-class press (even more broadly, the democratic press at large), the trade unions, and so forth. 
 For example, we read the following in issueNo. 
 2 of the Left-Narodnik Severnaya Mysl : “To the honour of the Marxists be it said that at present they enjoy considerable influence in the unions [i. 
e. 
, the trade unions ] whereas we Left Narodniks work in them without a definite plan , and for that reason our influence is scarcely felt . 
” Strange, is it not? The conciliatory, tolerant, “united”, non-splitting, broad-minded, non-dogmatic Narodniks—notwithstanding their ardent desire and striving —conduct no insurance campaign, exercise no influence on the trade unions, and have no organised group in the Duma. 
 But the “dogmatic” Marxists, who are “for ever splitting” and thereby enfeebling themselves, fought a splendid election campaignduring the Fourth Duma elections, are conducting success-ful activities in the trade unions, are running a splendidand vigorous insurance campaign, carry on fairly effectiveactivities in the strike movement, pass unanimous decisions which are consistent in principle, and are unanimously, firmly and with conviction supported by an obvious andunquestionable majority of the class-conscious workers. 
 Strange, is it not? Are not the “conciliatoriness”, and all the other splendid spiritual qualities of the Narodniksmerely sterile things ? That is exactly what they are—sterile! The “unity” of the varied intellectualist little groups is bought by theNarodniks at the price of their utter political impotenceamong the masses. 
 And with us Marxists, too, it is theTrotskyists, 44 the liquidators, the “conciliators”, and the “Tyszka-ites”,45 those who shout loudest about group unity, who display the same intellectualist impotence, while the real political campaigns, not the imaginary ones, but thosethat grow out of actual conditions (election, insurance,daily press, strike campaigns, etc. 
) show that the majority of the class-conscious workers are rallied around those whoare most often, most zealously and most fiercely accused of being “splitters”. 
 The conclusion to be drawn is clear, and however unpalat-able it may be to the host of intellectualist groups the course of the working-class movement will compel them to admit it. 
 This conclusion is that attempts to create “unity” by means of “agreements” or “alliances” among intellectualist groups, which in fact express tendencies that are injurious to the working-class movement (Narodism, liquidationism,etc. 
), lead only to complete disintegration and impotence. 
Both Narodism and liquidationism have proved this by their lamentable example. 
 Only in opposition to these groups and grouplets (in a strenuous struggle, which is inevitable under bourgeoisconditions and amidst a host of petty-bourgeois vacilla-tions) is real unity building up among the working-classmasses led by the majority of the class-conscious proletari-ans. 
 Naïve people will ask: How are we to distinguish the intellectualist groups which are causing damage to theworking-class movement by disintegrating it and condemn-ing it to impotence, from that group or groups whichideologically express the working-class movement, rally,unite and strengthen it? There are only two ways of dis-tinguishing one from the other: theory and practical experi-ence. 
 It is necessary seriously to examine the theoreticalcontent of such trends of thought as Narodism and liquida-tionism (the principal petty-bourgeois trends that are disin-tegrating the working-class movement). 
 It is necessary tocarefully study the practical experience of the mass work-ing-class movement as a means of rallying the majority of class-conscious workers around integral and considereddecisions, based on principle and applied in elections, ininsurance campaigns, in activities in the trade unions, inthe strike movement, in the “underground”, and so forth. 
 He who gives close thought to the theory of Marxism and close attention to the practical experience of the last few years will realise that the elements of a genuine workers’party are rallying in Russia in spite of the motley, noisy, and vociferous (but essentially futile and harmful) groupsof Narodniks, liquidators, and so forth. 
 Unity of the work-ing class is emerging from the disintegration of these groups and their isolation from the proletariat. 
 Proletarskaya Pravda No. 
 12, Published according to December 20, 1913 the text in Proletarskaya Pravda COMMENT ON KAUTSK Y’S LETTE R46 K. 
 Kautsky has realised (at last!) that the Tyszka group of “Tyszka” and Rosa Luxemburg does not represent the Polish Social-Democratic workers and that the Warsaw andLodz organisations have to be reckoned with. 
 It is a good thing that he has at last understood facts which have been known to Russian Marxist workers for years . 
 But the very fact that for years Rosa L. 
 and Tyszka could pass off a fiction for reality shows how deplorably misinformed are the German Social-Democrats, includingKautsky! Kautsky reveals still greater ignorance of the subject when he writes that “as far as he knows” the PolishSocialist Party “Left wing” split away from the P. 
S. 
P. 
“Right wing” 47 in order to take a fully Social-Democratic stand. 
 It is well known—one may say here—that this time Kautsky does not at all know what he is writing about. 
 Our readers should make themselves familiar with at least thearticle by Henryk Kamie [ski “From Nationalism to Liqui-dationism” ( Prosveshcheniye No. 
 10). 
 The author of this ar-ticle is a Pole and knows what he is writing about. 
 From this article our readers will see that the P. 
S. 
P. 
 Left wing is not Social-Democratic at all. 
 Besides, it would be ridi-culous to think that people who desire to take a fully Social-Democratic stand, and are capable of doing so, would retain “their own” programme and the title of a non-Social-Democratic party. 
 The forthcoming “exchange of opinions” among all Social-Democratic groups in Russia and Poland through the mediumof the Executive Committee of the International SocialistBureau will reveal Kautsky’s error and show that none of the Polish Social-Democrats regard, nor can regard, the P. 
S. 
P. 
 Left wing as a Social-Democratic Party. 
 We would add that Kautsky says nothing to repudiate (although he wrote in Vorwärts48) the report of his state-ment made in this very Vorwärts that “the old Party has disappeared” in Russia. 
 The forthcoming “exchange ofopinions” will also expose this monstrous blunder of Kaut-sky’s. 
 Proletarskaya Pravda No. 
 12, Published according to December 20, 1913 the text in Proletarskaya Pravda NOVOYE VREMYA AND RECH ON THE RIGHT OF NATIONS TO SELF-DETERMINATION As was to be expected, the controversy between the Social-Democrats and the Cadets on the question of the right of nations to self-determination has aroused the interest of Novoye Vremya . 
 In issue No. 
 13563, this mouthpiece of Great-Russian nationalism writes: “What to Social-Democrats is an axiom of political wisdom [i. 
e. 
, recognition of the right of nations to self-determination, to secession]is today beginning to cause disagreement even among the Cadets. 
” Despite this Black-Hundred dig at the liberals (the word “even”), Novoye Vremya is compelled to quote the Rech statement that “the Cadets have never undertaken to de-fend the right of nations to secede from the Russian state”. 
 This statement is so forthright that Novoye Vremya is compelled to prevaricate. 
 It writes: “Judging by the facts, the loose concept of cultural self-determi-nation evidently differs, from the Cadets point of view, from theadvocacy of separatism, only in its mode of operation. 
” But Novoye Vremya understands perfectly well the differ-ence between the absurd “cultural”, and real, i. 
e. 
, political , self-determination, for further on we read: “Indeed, the Cadets have never pledged themselves to advocate the right of nations to secede from the Russian state ... except by the immeasurably more polished method of accepting subsidies for theirpress organs from non-Russians and Jews. 
” The old, crude and ridiculous Black-Hundred device of taunting the liberals for receiving assistance from the Jews! But we must not allow these silly little tricks to obscurethe main thing: and the main thing is that Novoye Vremya , in admitting that the Cadets have never undertaken to defend the right to secede , has come to fully realise the differ-ence between the Social-Democrats and the Cadets. 
 The difference between the Constitutional-Democrats and the Social-Democrats is the distinction between national-liberals and consistent democrats.

 Martov has confirmed the fact already noted in Pro-letarskaya Pravda that I was not a member of the Strike Subcommittee , and that on the committee I opposed the clause concerning “criminal liability”. 
 * I need now only add that I advocated not only “mitigation” of penalties, as Mr. 
 Martov “remembers”, but of course the complete deletion of such a clause. 
 There was no need for me to move any amend-ments, because the draft then under discussion did not con-tain any such clause, and it was Mr.

 FOUR THOUSAND RUBLES A YEAR AND A SIX-HOUR DAY This is the battle-cry of the class-conscious American workers. 
 They say: We have only one political question be-fore us, and that is the question of the workers’ earnings and their working day. 
 To Russian workers it may at first sight seem very strange and puzzling to have all social and political questionsreduced to a single one. 
 But in the United States of Amer-ica, the most advanced country in the world, which has almost complete political liberty, where democratic institu-tions are most developed, and where tremendous prog-ress has been made in labour productivity, it is quitenatural that the question of socialism should come to thefore. 
 Thanks to the existence of complete political liberty, it is possible in America, better than in any other country, to calculate the total production of wealth and draw up astatistical report of production. 
 That calculation, based onreliable data, shows that in America there are, in roundnumbers, 15,000,000 working-class families. 
 Together, these working-class families annually produce consumers’ goods to the value of sixty thousand million rubles. 
 This works out at 4,000 rubles a year per working-class family. 
 But at present, under the capitalist social system, only half this vast amount of wealth, only thirty thousand milli-ons, goes to the workers, who constitute nine-tenths of the population. 
 The other half is pocketed by the capitalists who, with all their apologists and hangers-on, constituteonly one-tenth of the population. 
 In America, as in other countries, unemployment is rife and the cost of living is steadily rising. 
 Want among the workers is becoming more and more distressful and intoler-able. 
 American statistics show that about half the workers are working part time . 
 And what an immense amount of social labour is still being wasted owing to the preservationof senseless, backward and scattered small production, par-ticularly in agriculture and in commerce! Thanks to complete political liberty and the absence of feudal landlords in America, machinery is employed thereon a wider scale than anywhere else in the world. 
 The aggre-gate power of the machines employed in the manufacturingindustry alone amounts to eighteen million steam h. 
p. 
 At the same time, an investigation of all power resources in the form of waterfalls showed, according to the report of March 14, 1912, that by converting the power of waterfalls intoelectricity America could immediately obtain an additionalsixty million h. 
p. 
! Already a land of boundless wealth, it can at one stroke treble its wealth, treble the productivity of its social labour, and thereby guarantee to all working-class famil-ies a decent standard of living worthy of intelligent hu-man beings, and a not excessively long working day of sixhours. 
 But owing to the capitalist social system we see in most of the big cities of America—and in the rural districts too for that matter—appalling unemployment and poverty, a wanton waste of human labour side by side with the unprece-dented luxury of the multimillionaires, of the rich, whosefortunes run into thousands of millions. 
 The American working class is rapidly becoming enlight-ened, and is organising in a powerful proletarian party. 
 Sympathy for this party is growing among all the working people. 
 Working with the aid of first-class machines, andseeing at every turn marvels of engineering and the magnif-icent successes of labour resulting from the organisation oflarge-scale production, the wage-slaves of America are begin-ning clearly to realise what their tasks are, and are advanc-ing the plain, obvious and immediate demands for an income of four thousand rubles a year for every working-class family,and a six-hour day. 
 The aim of the American workers is quite attainable in any civilised country in the world; but to achieve it, the country must enjoy the fundamental conditions of freedom.... 
 And there is no road to a free future other than by way of an independent working-class organisation, educational,industrial, co-operative and political. 
 Proletarskaya Pravda No. 
 19, Published according to January 1, 1914 the text in Proletarskaya Pravda Signed: I. 
 IS A COMPULSORY OFFICIAL LANGUAGE NEEDED? The liberals differ from the reactionaries in that they rec-ognise the right to have instruction conducted in the nativelanguage, at least in the elementary schools. 
 But they are completely at one with the reactionaries on the point that a compulsory official language is necessary. 
 What does a compulsory official language mean? In prac-tice, it means that the language of the Great Russians, whoare a minority of the population of Russia, is imposed upon all the rest of the population of Russia. 
 In every school theteaching of the official language must be obligatory . 
 All official correspondence must be conducted in the official language, not in the language of the local population. 
 On what grounds do the parties who advocate a compulsory official language justify its necessity? The “arguments” of the Black Hundreds are curt, of course. 
 They say: All non-Russians should be ruled with a rod of iron to keep them from “getting out of hand”. 
 Russia must be indivisible, and all the peoples must submit to Great-Russian rule, for it was the Great Russians who built up andunited the land of Russia. 
 Hence, the language of the rulingclass must be the compulsory official language. 
 The Purish-keviches would not mind having the “local lingoes” banned altogether, although they are spoken by about 60 per cent of Russia’s total population. 
 The attitude of the liberals is much more “cultured” and “refined”. 
 They are for permitting the use of the native lan-guages within certain limits (for example, in the elementaryschools). 
 At the same time they advocate an obligatory official language, which, they say, is necessary in the in-terests of “culture”, in the interests of a “united” and “indi-visible” Russia, and so forth. 
 “Statehood is the affirmation of cultural unity .... 
 An official language is an essential constituent of state culture .... 
 Statehood is based on unity of authority, the official language being an instrumentof that unity. 
 The official language possesses the same compulsory and universally coercive power as all other forms of statehood .... 
 “If Russia is to remain united and indivisible, we must firmly insist on the political expediency of the Russian literary language. 
 ” This is the typical philosophy of a liberal on the neces-sity of an official language. 
 We have quoted the above passage from an article by Mr. 
 S. 
 Patrashkin in the liberal newspaper Dyen49 (No. 
 7). 
 For quite understandable reasons, the Black-HundredNovoye Vremya rewarded the author of these ideas with a resounding kiss. 
 Mr. 
 Patrashkin expresses “very sound ideas”,Menshikov’s newspaper stated (No. 
 13588). 
 Another paper the Black Hundreds are constantly praising for such very “sound” ideas is the national-liberal Russkaya Mysl . 
 50 An d how can they help praising them when the liberals, with theaid of “cultured” arguments, are advocating things thatplease the Novoye Vremya people so much? Russian is a great and mighty language, the liberals tell us. 
 Don’t you want everybody who lives in the border regions of Russia to know this great and mighty language?Don’t you see that the Russian language will enrich the lit-erature of the non-Russians, put great treasures of culturewithin their reach, and so forth? That is all true, gentlemen, we say in reply to the lib-erals. 
 We know better than you do that the language of Tur-genev, Tolstoy, Dobrolyubov and Chernyshevsky is a greatand mighty one. 
 We desire more than you do that the closestpossible intercourse and fraternal unity should be establishedbetween the oppressed classes of all the nations that inhabitRussia, without any discrimination. 
 And we, of course, are in favour of every inhabitant of Russia having the opportu-nity to learn the great Russian language. 
 What we do not want is the element of coercion . 
 We do not want to have people driven into paradise with a cudgel;for no matter how many fine phrases about “culture” youmay utter, a compulsory official language involves coercion, the use of the cudgel. 
 We do not think that the great and mighty Russian language needs anyone having to study itby sheer compulsion . 
 We are convinced that the development of capitalism in Russia, and the whole course of social life in general, are tending to bring all nations closer together. 
Hundreds of thousands of people are moving from one endof Russia to another; the different national populations areintermingling; exclusiveness and national conservatism mustdisappear. 
 People whose conditions of life and work make it necessary for them to know the Russian language will learn it without being forced to do so. 
 But coercion (the cudgel) will have only one result: it will hinder the great and mighty Russian language from spreading to other na-tional groups, and, most important of all, it will sharpenantagonism, cause friction in a million new forms, increaseresentment, mutual misunderstanding, and so on. 
 Who wants that sort of thing? Not the Russian people, not the Russian democrats. 
 They do not recognise national oppression in any form , even in “the interests of Russian culture and statehood”. 
 That is why Russian Marxists say that there must be no compulsory official language, that the population must beprovided with schools where teaching will be carried on in all the local languages, that a fundamental law must be in-troduced in the constitution declaring invalid all privilegesof any one nation and all violations of the rights of nationalminorities. 
 Proletarskaya Pravda No. 
 14 (32), Published according to January 18, 1914 the text in Proletarskaya Pravda TO CAMILLE HUYSMANS At your personal request I am writing the following brief report ( bref rapport ) in my own name, and apologise in advance for any gaps in this report ( rapport ), as I am hard pressed for time. 
 The Central Committee of our Party willprobably find occasion to send its own official report * t o the Executive Committee of the International Socialist Bureau, and to correct any possible errors in my own privatereport. 
 What are the differences ( dissentiments ) between the Cen-tral Committee of our Party and the Organising Committee ? That is the question. 
 These differences may be reduced to the following six points: I The Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party was formed in 1898 as an illegal Party, and has always remained such. 
 Today too our Party can exist only as an illegal Party, since in Russia even the party of the moderate liberals has notbeen legalised. 
 Until the 1905 Revolution in Russia, however, the liberals published an illegal organ abroad. 
 51 When the revolution was defeated, the liberals turned their backs upon it and indignantly rejected the idea of an illegal press. 
 And so after the revolution the idea arose in the opportunist wingof our Party of renouncing the illegal Party, of liquidating it (hence the name “ liquidators ”) and of substituting for it a legal (“open”) party. 
 On two occasions, in 1908 and in 1910, our entire Party condemned liquidationism 52 formally and unqualifiedly. 
 On *See pp. 
 233-36 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 this point the differences are absolutely irreconcilable. 
 It is impossible to restore and build up an illegal Party with people who do not believe in it and have no desire at all to build it up. 
 The Organising Committee and the Conference of August 191253 which elected it, recognise the illegal Party in word . 
 In deed , however, after the decisions of the August Con-ference, the liquidators’ newspaper in Russia ( Luch and Novaya Rabochaya Gazeta in 1912-13), continued to attack , in the legal press, the very existence of the illegalParty (numerous articles by L. 
 S. 
, F. 
 D. 
, Zasulich, andothers). 
 Thus, we disagree with the Organising Committee because the latter is a fiction, which in word denies that it is liqui-dationist, but in fact screens and whitewashes the liqui-dators’ group in Russia. 
 We disagree with the Organising Committee because the latter is unwilling (and unable, for it is helpless againstthe liquidators’ group) to condemn liquidationism emphati-cally and irrevocably. 
 We cannot build up an illegal Party except by fighting those who attack it in the legal press. 
 In Russia there are now(since 1912) two St. 
 Petersburg workers’ dailies: one fulfils and carries out the decisions of the illegal Party ( Pravda ). 
 The other ( Luch and Novaya Rabochaya Gazeta ) attacks the illegal Party, defies it, and tries to convince the workers that it is unnecessary. 
 Unity between the illegal Party and the group that is fighting against the existence of the illegalParty is impossible until the paper run by the liquidators’group radically changes its line, or until the OrganisingCommittee emphatically condemns it and breaks with it. 
 II Our differences with the liquidators are the same as those between reformists and revolutionaries everywhere. 
 How-ever, these differences are greatly aggravated and made ir-reconcilable by the fact that the liquidators, in the legal press, fight against revolutionary slogans. 
 Unity is impos-sible with a group which, for example, declares in the legalpress that the slogan of a republic, or of the confiscation of the big landed estates, is unsuitable for agitation among the masses. 
 In the legal press we cannot refute such propaganda, which is objectively tantamount to betraying socialism and making concessions to liberalism and the monarchy. 
 And the Russian monarchy is such that a few more revo-lutions will be needed to teach the Russian tsars constitu-tionalism. 
 There can be no unity between our illegal Party, which secretly organises revolutionary strikes and demonstrations, and the group of publicists who in the legal press call thestrike movement a “strike craze”. 
 III We disagree on the national question. 
 This question is a very acute one in Russia. 
 The programme of our Party em-phatically rejects so-called “extra-territorial and nationalautonomy”. 
 Advocacy of the latter actually amounts to thepreaching of refined bourgeois nationalism. 
 Nevertheless, theAugust Conference of the liquidators (1912) recognised this “extra-territorial national autonomy” thereby deliberately violating the Party Programme. 
 Comrade Plekhanov, whotakes a neutral stand between the Central Committee andthe Organising Committee, protested against this violationof the Programme, describing it as adaptation of socialismto nationalism. 
 We disagree with the Organising Committee because the latter refuses to rescind a decision which violates our PartyProgramme. 
 IV Furthermore, we disagree on the national question in re-spect of organisation. 
 The Copenhagen Congress definitely condemned the division of trade unions according to nation-ality. 
 54 Moreover, the experience of Austria has shown that in this respect it is impossible to draw a distinction be-tween the trade unions and the political party of the prole-tariat. 
 Our Party has always stood for a united, international organisation of the Social-Democratic Party. 
 In 1908, be-fore the split, the Party repeated its demand for the amalga-mation of all the national Social-Democratic organisations in the local areas. 
 We disagree with the Bund, the separate Jewish workers’ organisation, which supports the Organising Committee,because, despite Party decisions, the Bund flatly refusesto proclaim the principle of the unity of all national organi-sations in the local areas, and to bring about such an amal-gamation. 
 It must be emphasised that the Bund refuses to amalga-mate not only with organisations subordinated to our Cen-tral Committee, but also with the Lettish Social-DemocraticParty, the Polish Social-Democratic Party and the PolishSocialist Party (the Left wing). 
 Consequently, when the Bundposes as an amalgamator, we reject its claim, and declare that it is the Bund that is splitting the movement, since it refuses to bring about international unity among theSocial-Democratic workers in the local organisations. 
 V We disagree with the step taken by the Organising Com-mittee in defending the alliance of the liquidators and theBund with a non-Social-Democratic party, the P. 
S. 
P. 
 (theLeft wing), despite the protests of the two sections of the Polish Social-Democratic Party. 
 The Polish Social-Democratic Party has been affiliated to our Party ever since 1906-07. 
 The P. 
S. 
P. 
 (the Left wing) was never affiliated with our Party. 
 By entering into an alliance with the P. 
S. 
P. 
 in opposition to the two sections of the Polish Social-Democratic Party theOrganising Committee is guilty of scandalous splitting action. 
 By accepting in the Social-Democratic group in the Duma the non-Social-Democrat Jagiello, a member of the P. 
S. 
P. 
,despite formal protests by the two sections of the PolishSocial-Democratic Party, the Organising Committee andits supporters among the deputies in the Duma are guiltyof scandalous splitting action. 
 We disagree with the Organising Committee because the latter is unwilling to condemn and annul this splittingalliance with the P. 
S. 
P. 
 (the Left wing). 
 VI Lastly, we disagree with the Organising Committee, and with many of the groups and fictitious organisations abroad,because our opponents are unwilling to admit openly, loy-ally and unequivocally that our Party enjoys the support ofthe overwhelming majority of the class-conscious workersof Russia. 
 We attach extremely great importance to this because, on the basis of bald statements unsupported by precise and veri-fiable facts, the most glaring falsehoods are often circulatedabroad about the state of affairs in Russia. 
 The alternative is clear: either our opponents admit that there are irreconcilable differences between us (in which case their talk about unity is hypocrisy), or they see no ir-reconcilable differences (in which case, if they do not want tobe regarded as splitters, they must loyally admit that weare the absolute majority). 
 By what public and verifiable facts can it be proved which side enjoys the support of the real majority of the class-conscious and organised Social-Democratic workers in Rus-sia? First, by the Duma elections. 
Secondly, by the information published in both Social-Democratic newspapers during the whole of 1912 and nearlythe whole of 1913. 
 It can be readily understood that the only convincing material on the question at issue is provided by the dailynewspapers of the two trends in St. 
 Petersburg for two years. 
 Thirdly, by public statements made by workers in Rus-sia (in the columns of both newspapers) in favour of one or the other of the two Social-Democratic groups in the Duma. 
 All these three sets of facts were given in our Central Committee’s official report to the International SocialistBureau (session of December 14, 1913). 
 I will briefly recapit-ulate these facts. 
 First: 47 per cent of the deputies elected by the worker curia in the elections to the Second Duma (1907), 50 per cent of such deputies in the elections to the Third Duma (1907-12), and 67 per cent in the elections to the Fourth Duma wereBolsheviks (i. 
e. 
, our adherents).

 Peters-burg published reports of the funds collected by workers’ groups: 556 groups collected funds for the liquidators andall their allies, while 2,181 groups collected funds for our Party. 
 Thirdly, up to November 20, 1913, 4,850 workers expressed support, over their signatures , for our group in the Duma, as against 2,539 workers who expressed support for the liqui-dators (and all their allies, the Bund, the Caucasians, and so on andso forth). 
 These precise and verifiable facts prove that during the two years, we united the overwhelming majority of Social-Democratic workers’ groups in Russia, despite the incredible difficulties the illegal Party in Russia has to contend with. 
 (In the matter of publishing illegal literature and or-ganising illegal, strictly Party conferences, the odds in ourfavour are even greater. 
) Since we have in two years united the overwhelming ma-jority of Social-Democratic workers’ groups in Russia, we claim recognition for our method of organisation. 
 We cannot depart from that method. 
 Those who recognise the illegal Party, but refuse to recog-nise our method of organisation, which has been endorsedby two years’ of experience and by the will of the majorityof the class-conscious workers, are guilty of splitting tactics. 
 Such is my brief report.

 ) The Penza Zemstvo55 is conducting a valuation and sta-tistical investigation on the basis of a programme so fulland detailed that it must arouse exceptional interest in everystudent of Russia’s economic system. 
 A complete census is being taken of all peasant households according to an abbreviated household card. 
 In addition, every third household is described according to a moredetailed brief household card; every ninth household is described in a still fuller household card, called the detailed card; every twenty-seventh household is described in a still fuller household card, called the special card; and, lastly, twenty-five households in the uyezd (probably representingabout one-thousandth of the total households) gave theirbudgets in still greater detail. 
 In all, we have five degrees of more or less detailed inves-tigation, and the fuller programme contains all the questions that are included in the abbreviated programme. 
 In the preface, the authors indicate the degree of fullness of eachof these five descriptions in the following manner: “The budget covers the entire production and consumption of the peasant household. 
 “The special description studies, in each household, the sale and purchase of agricultural produce and the turnover of stock-breeding (on a special form), and all the questions contained in the detailed household card. 
 “The detailed household card lists all the properties, undertak-ings and occupations of the members of the household, registers thesex, age and literacy of the members of the family and the value oflivestock, dead stock and buildings, and records the incomes from undertakings and occupations and crops, and expenditure on hiring labour. 
 “The brief household card contains only data on the sex, age and literacy of the members of the family, and lists their properties, un-dertakings and occupations, livestock and dead stock. 
 “The abbreviated household card registers the size of the family divided according to sex, the number of male workers, the properties and undertakings of the family, except rented land, the principallivestock, the literacy and outside occupations of the male workersand also the number of boys and girls attending school. 
” It is to be regretted that the volume contains no appendix with a full list of the questions contained in all the five types of descriptions. 
 Only the briefest (“abbreviated”) household card is appended, and this gives (approximately) a no less de-tailed description of the households than is given in the cardsused in agricultural censuses organised on European lines. 
 It may be said without exaggeration that if the Penza statisticians investigate the whole gubernia according to the above programme the data they will collect will be al-most ideal. 
 Let us assume that there are 270,000 householdsin the gubernia (actually the figure is probably higher). 
This will give us 90,000 descriptions containing data on theamount of land rented, and on all the live and dead stock;it will also give us 30,000 descriptions containing data on the crops ( of each household ), on expenditure on hired labour, and value of farm implements and buildings. 
 It will giveus a further 10,000 descriptions of the sale and purchase ofagricultural produce as well as the “turnover of stock-breed-ing” (i. 
e. 
, probably a precise description of the conditionsunder which livestock is kept and fed, the productivity of stock-breeding, etc. 
). 
 And lastly, it will give us two hundred and fifty budgets which, counting ten typical groups of peasant households, will give exhaustive descriptions of each group based on twenty-five budgets per group, i. 
e. 
, quite sufficient to obtain steady averages. 
 In short, if this programme is fulfilled, peasant husbandry in the Penza Gubernia will have been studied magnificently, and far better than in West-European censuses (which, itis true, cover the whole country, not a gubernia). 
 The whole point is, how these excellent data will be tabulated . 
 That is the main difficulty. 
 Herein lies the weakest spot of our Zemstvo statistics, which as far as thoroughness and care for detail are concerned, are splendid. 
 The data oneach of the 300,000 households (or each of the 90,000, 30,000or 10,000) may be splendid, but if they are not properlytabulated they will be utterly useless for scientific purposes,for an understanding of Russia’s economics, inasmuch as general averages per village commune, volost, uyezd or gubernia, tell us very little. 
 It is precisely at the present time that semi-medieval (patriarchal and feudal) agriculture in Russia is undergoinga process of capitalist transformation. 
 This process startedover half a century ago. 
 During this long period of time, a vast amount of miscellaneous information on the various features of this process has been collected in Russian eco-nomic literature. 
 The important thing now is that this massof Zemstvo statistics, so admirable in details, thoroughnessand authenticity, should be properly tabulated . 
 These sta-tistics must be tabulated in such a way as to provide an an-swer , a precise and objective answer, based on mass data, to all the questions indicated or outlined in the course of over half a century’s analysis of the post-Reform economicsof Russia (and at the present time the Stolypin agrarianlegislation poses a great number of new and extremely inter-esting questions concerning Russia’s post-revolutionary eco-nomics). 
 The statistical returns must be tabulated in such a way as to make it possible to study from them the process by which the old, feudal, natural economy, based on the corvée andlabour service, is being destroyed and superseded by commer-cial, capitalist economy. 
 No person in Russia at all familiar with politics and economics can now doubt that this process is going on. 
 The only question is how to tabulate these excel-lent house-to-house data so as to prevent them from being wasted , and to facilitate the study of all aspects of this ex-tremely complex and varied process. 
 To meet these requirements, the tabulation of the house-to-house statistics should yield the greatest number of group and complex tables drawn up in the most rational and detailed manner, so that all the types of households that have been noted—or evidence of which have been noted (this is no less important)—may be studied separately. 
 Without varied and rationally compiled group and complex tables, this wealth of house-to-house statistics will simply bewasted. 
 That is the greatest weakness of present-day statis-tics, which of late have been suffering increasingly from whatI would call “statistical cretinism”—an inability to see thewood for the trees; economic types of phenomena are sub-merged in a welter of figures, types that can be brought out only in varied and rationally compiled group and complex tables. 
 To be called rationally compiled, such tables must first of all enable one to trace the process of development of capi-talism in all its ramifications and forms. 
 Only such a tabu-lation can be regarded as rational as will bring into focus the best preserved types of natural economy and the variousdegrees to which it is being superseded by commercial andcapitalist agriculture (in different areas commercial agricul-ture assumes different forms, drawing first one and thenanother branch of agriculture into the process of production for the market). 
 The various types of economy that are in the process of transition from exclusively natural agricultureto the sale of labour-power (what we call “industries”, which consist in the sale of labour-power) and also to the purchase of labour-power, should be dealt with separately in specialdetail. 
 So also must the various types of households according to their level of wealth (degree of accumulation of capital, and of opportunity of forming and accumulating it), and according to size of aggregate agricultural production,and the size of those branches of agricultural productionwhich in the given locality and at the given time lendthemselves most easily to transformation into commercial agriculture or commercial stock-breeding, and so on and so forth. 
 This transformation of natural economy into commercial agriculture is the crux of the matter in a study of the moderneconomics of agriculture. 
 The endless errors and prejudicesof official, liberal-professorial, petty-bourgeois Narodnik and opportunist “theory”, are due to failure to understand this transformation or to inability to trace it in its extremelyvaried forms. 
 Judging from the volume mentioned above, the work of the Penza statisticians is being performed by people who do not go about the job in bureaucratic fashion, but are really interested in their subject and capable of producingscientific research of immense value. 
 Nevertheless thiswork seems to be suffering from an excess of statistical redtape or statistical zeal and from a lack of politico-economiccommon sense and purpose. 
 The volume under review contains, first of all, reference material on the villages. 
 This material takes up a little lessthan one-tenth of the book. 
 The other nine-tenths consistof tables drawn up according to village communes. 
 Eachgroup of peasants (according to size of holdings) in each com-mune in each village is given a separate horizontal line (there are altogether 1,009 for the whole uyezd) containing 139 columns. 
 The information is given in remarkable detail. 
Nine-tenths of this information will probably never berequired for any kind of reference even by the most inquis-itive of the local inhabitants. 
 But remarkable detail verges on something like sta-tistical mania when we see columns 119-139, i. 
e. 
, twenty-one columns, giving the relative numbers , i. 
e. 
, the percentages, for each of the thousand uyezd divisions! The statisticianshave made thousands and tens of thousands of calculationsfor a single uyezd, which even the local inhabitants may needonly in highly exceptional cases. 
 The statisticians have made about 15,000 to 20,000 calculations, of which probably only a dozen or two will be needed by local inhabitants alone , who could have made these calculations themselves on the rare occasions they required them. 
 The vast labour wasted by the statisticians detracts from the amount of work they are able (with the available personnel and the available budget—the Zemstvo budgets provide very modest funds for statistics!) to devote to in-vestigation. 
 The volume under review contains thousandsof figures constituting an unnecessary statistical “luxury”,but it does not contain a single summary. 
 All summaries have been left for subsequent volumes. 
 In the first place, we are not sure that other volumes will appear, nor can the Russian Zemstvo statisticians, who are too dependent onpolice tyranny, be sure of this. 
 And secondly, without a test being made of the various group and complex tables according to uyezd, it is never possible to obtain a full and scientifically satisfactory system of summarised, group and complex tables according to gubernia. 
 So far we have a deplorable fact—a volume of Zemstvo statistics of negligible, almost negatory scientific value,on which an immense amount of labour has been wasted, andwhich contains a wealth of valuable and up-to-date data (the result of the law of November 9 !) that have not been summarised, collated, grouped, or combined. 
 We shall mention at least some of the groups that could and should have been established in order to render thiswealth of Zemstvo statistics serviceable. 
 The uyezd and thegubernia should be divided into districts showing where commercial agriculture of the various types is most prevalent (the distilling of liquor from grain and potatoes; the saleof dairy products; butter and oil making; special commercialcrops, and so on, and so forth); then according to the preva-lence of non-agricultural and migratory industries; conditionsof landlord economy (the nearness of landed estates, or the absence of same; the predominance of serf-like corvée, la-bour service, métayage, share-cropping, and so forth, or ofcapitalist, landlord farming employing hired labour); alsothe degree to which commerce and capitalist turnover ingeneral are developed (an extremely important divisionwhich must positively be made as an elementary requirement of political economy, and which can easily be made, although that is usually not done: that is to say, to group villagesaccording to their distance from railways, market-places,trade centres, and so forth); according to size of village (inthe Krasnoslobodsk Uyezd there are about 30,000 house-holds distributed over 278 villages, but 19 of the largest villages have a total of 9,000 households; in all probability the conditions vary). 
 It is desirable and necessary to group households not only according to the size of their holdings but also accordingto the crop area (in their preface the compilers say thatpeasant farming in Penza Gubernia is conducted “mainly on the peasants’ own land and not on rented land”; but this statement is too sweeping, and the question of renting landis of vast importance and should be elaborated in detail); likewise, according to the area under commercial crops, wherever and whenever they are to be observed and can be itemised; further, according to “industries” (but not in the crude way that this is usually done, as if in mockery of po-litical economy, by taking “households with members en-gaged in industries” and those without such members; it isabsolutely necessary to indicate the status of the person inthe industry: households in which a large, medium, or small number of the members go out to work as hired labourers; households which own small or large establishments employ-ing a small, medium or large number of wage-workers,and so forth), and according to the number of livestockowned (this has partly been done in this volume), etc. 
 Complex tables, ten of them, say, with the households divided (again approximately) into ten groups according to the various indications of capitalism’s penetration intoagriculture, would give—assuming that we have 80 columns—8,000 new calculations, i. 
e. 
, would take up much lessspace than the 20,000 worthless calculations of percentagesfor each separate village commune. 
 The scientific value of such varied complex tables which show the great diversity of forms in which agriculture and theagriculturalist are subordinated to the market, would betremendous. 
 It may be said without exaggeration that theywould revolutionise the science of agricultural economics.

 Price not indicated. 
 This extremely useful book briefly catalogues the material on labour protection exhibited at the All-Russia Hygiene Exhibition. 
 It contains a vast amount of valuable statisticaldata on a number of questions affecting the lives of the work-ers, such as the number of workers employed in variousindustries, female and child labour, the working day andwages, sanitary conditions and labour protection, sickness and mortality among the workers, alcoholism, workers’ insurance, and so on and so forth. 
 Appended is an excellent index to the literature on labour protection. 
 The absence, in many cases, of absolute figures (only percentages are given) is a shortcoming of the book, as is the absence of a general subject index that would enable the reader quickly to find the data he needed on differentquestions. 
 It would be desirable to have these faults eliminated in subsequent editions. 
 All who are interested in the labourquestion, and all trade unions, insurance and other working-class organisations, will undoubtedly avail themselves of this book. 
 Subsequent editions can and should make thisbook a systematic catalogue of material on questions con-cerning the conditions and protection of labour in Russia.

 THE LIBERALS ’ CORRUPTION OF THE WORKERS The boycott, or rather the frothy radical chatter that is increasingly becoming the sole content of liquidator writ-ings, often obscures from the reader the principles under-lying liquidator propaganda. 
 That is exactly what theliberal-labour politicians are after—that amidst the din, hullabaloo, and fireworks of radical claptrap the workers should more easily swallow bourgeois platitudes against the Marxist organisation. 
 But class-conscious workers will not be deceived by the rantings of sham “political campaigns” launched by the dis-ruptors of the workers’ organisation. 
 What class-conscious workers appreciate most of all and first of all in every press organ is adherence to high principle. 
 What are the workersreally being taught under cover of the “opposition” claptrap,clamour and claims to defend the interests of the workers?—that is the main, the basic and, properly speaking, the onlyimportant question that every thinking worker asks himself. 
 The thinking worker knows that the most dangerous of advisers are those liberal friends of the workers who claimto be defending their interests, but are actually trying todestroy the class independence of the proletariat and itsorganisation. 
 It is therefore our bounden duty to open the workers’ eyes to the manner in which the liquidators are destroying the organisation. 
 Take, for example, the programmaticleading article in the New Year’s issue of the liquidators’organ. 
 We are told: “The working class is heading towards a political party of the proletariat, which will function openly and be sufficiently powerfuland broad to resist the efforts of any political regime to deprive it of all rights, to deprive it of the possibility of fulfilling its normal functions of political leadership. 
” There you have an example of “ normal ” liberal claptrap in all its glory! No sensible liberal would refuse to raise both hands in favour of this splendid formula, by means of which the liquidator newspaper tries to conceal the fact that it is “heading” and striving towards the destruction of everythingthe proletariat has during the last twenty years achievedin the way of Marxist organisation, at the cost of so mucheffort. 
 Further on it is still more candid: “The road to the open political party of action is also the road to Party unity. 
” It has been stated thousands and thousands of times, in the most formal and most solemn declarations, stated as far back as 1908 and 1910, that this kind of talk is tantamount to renouncing, to liquidating, the past. 
 But the liquidators,nothing daunted, go on harping on the same theme in thehope of deceiving some terribly ignorant people with theiroutcries about “unity”. 
 Traitors to the entire Marxist past clamouring about an “open party”—and “unity” !... Why, this is an insult to the class-conscious workers. 
 It is an insult even to the“August” Conference of 1912, at which a handful of naïvepeople believed that the liquidators had abandoned theshameful liberal slogan of an open party. 
 But the whole point is that this gang of liberal hacks, all those F. 
 D. 
’s, Gammas, L. 
 M. 
’s, Em-El’s, Rakitins, 56 etc. 
, etc. 
, are waging their liberal campaign to destroy the Marxist organisation, deliberately flouting the resolutionsof both 1908 and 1910, and trying to deceive the non-class-conscious workers. 
 They think there are still ignorant peopleabout, who will believe their promises of an “open party” and fail to see that this is simply a variety of the liberal cam-paign against the existence of the genuine Marxist organi-sation! And whilst there are ignorant people about, thishandful of liberal hacks, who seek to liquidate the past,will continue their dirty work, no matter how many timesthey are told that “unity” with these disruptors and disorga-nisers is an absurdity and a fraud. 
 The New Year “leaderist” of the liquidator newspaper does not stand alone. 
 He is backed by all the liquidators, Mr. 
 P. 
 Karpov, for example, who, in issue No. 
 5 (123) of Novaya Rabochaya Gazeta , assures us that “overcoming [all the obstacles that are put in the way of organis-ing workers’ congresses] is nothing more nor less than a genuine strug-gle for freedom of association, i. 
e. 
, for the legalisation of the working-class movement, which is closely linked with the struggle for the openexistence of the workers’ Social-Democratic Party”. 
 No liberal or even Octobrist will deny sympathy with the struggle for the legalisation of the working-class movement! No liberal will utter a sound of protest against an “open par-ty”; he will even support those who advocate it as his bestaccomplices in fooling the workers. 
 In fulfilment of our duty, we shall never tire of repeating to the class-conscious workers that advocacy of an open workers’ party is empty liberal chatter, designed to corrupt the workers and to destroy the Marxist organisation. 
 Thelatter cannot exist and grow unless a determined and relent-less struggle is waged against those who are directing alltheir efforts towards destroying the Marxist organism, intowhich the upsurge of the last two years has infused new and healthy blood.

 LETTER TO THE EDITOR In his letter, published in Novaya Rabochaya Gazeta No. 
 16, A. 
 Bogdanov concealed the main reason for his dis-agreement with Pravda . 
 That reason is that A. 
 Bogdanov has for many years been opposing the philosophy of Marxism and upholding bour-geois idealist views against the materialism of Marx andEngels. 
 For that reason, the Marxist Bolsheviks several years ago considered it their duty to come out against Bogdanov. 
 Forthe same reason the Marxist Mensheviks, in the person of G. 
 V. 
 Plekhanov, are conducting a literary struggle against Bogdanov. 
 And lastly, for the very same reason, even theso-called Vperyod group 57 has broken with Bogdanov. 
 True, ever since Bogdanov began to contribute to Pravda , we doubted whether he would refrain from carrying hisfight against the philosophy of Marxism into the columns of the workers’ newspaper. 
 Unfortunately, A. 
 Bogdanov has-tened to confirm our fears. 
 After getting several small pop-ular articles on innocuous subjects, published in Pravda , he shortly submitted an article entitled “Ideology”, inwhich, in the most “popular” manner, he launched an attackupon the philosophy of Marxism. 
 The editors refused to publish that anti-Marxist article. 
 This was the cause of the conflict . 
 We advise A. 
 Bogdanov, instead of complaining about “family rows” to get that article entitled “Ideology” pub-lished (the liquidationist newspaper will not, of course, refuse hospitality to an anti-Marxist article). 
 All Marxists will then be able to see the real reason for our disagreement with Bogdanov, concerning which he said not a word in his lengthy letter. 
 We believe that the workers have set up a newspaper of their own in order that it should advocate Marxism, and not have its columns used to distort Marxism in the spirit of bourgeois “scholars”. 
 We are also very glad that A. 
 Bogdanov has once again raised the question of the article on the Vperyod group, which he sent to Pravda last summer. 
 Since A. 
 Bogdanov desires it, he will receive (in Prosveshcheniye ) a detailed statement about the number of untruths that article con-tained, and about the immense harm that adventurist grouphas caused the working-class movement in Russia.

 THE LIQUIDATORS ’ LEADER ON THE LIQUIDATORS ’ TERMS OF “UNITY ” Every crisis, every turning-point in any movement, is particularly interesting (and particularly useful to thosewho belong to it) in that it brings into clear and sharp focus that movement’s fundamental trends, its fundamental laws. 
 The International Socialist Bureau’s decision to arrange an “exchange of opinions” among all groups in Russia’s work-ing-class movement also marks a certain crisis or turning-point in the movement. 
 It will undoubtedly be very useful “loyally”, as the resolution of the International Socialist Bureau expresses it, i. 
e. 
, sincerely, to “exchange opinions”before an authoritative international body. 
 It will makeeverybody take a closer and more serious look at the course of the working-class movement in Russia. 
 We ought to be extremely grateful to Mr. 
 F. 
 D. 
, the well-known leader of the liquidators, for having of his own accord published in Novaya Rabochaya Gazeta No. 
 108 an extreme-ly valuable statement of his views on “amalgamation”,covered with only a thin veil of convention and bashfulness. 
Our best greetings to Mr. 
 F. 
 D. 
! It is pleasanter by far totalk with the opponent himself than with muddled or feeble go-betweens, etc. 
! With praiseworthy candour Mr. 
 F. 
 D. 
 sets forth and com-pares two points of view on amalgamation: one of them he rejects as “profoundly erroneous”; the other he approves ofand adheres to. 
 This is how Mr. 
 F. 
 D. 
 sets forth the first point of view: “One may argue thus: the differences among the Social-Democratic trends in Russia are negligible. 
 Therefore, on the grounds of theirnegligibility, we must, with help from the International, devise some organisational form of amalgamation—either federation, or a certain quota restricting the powers of any majority. 
 Once an accept-able external form of unity’ is found, the negligible differences will ‘vanish’ of themselves—everything will come right in the end. 
” Mr. 
 F. 
 D. 
 calls this point of view “profoundly erroneous”, without, however, naming its advocates (Trotsky, Kautsky,and all the “conciliators” in general). 
 The veil of conventionand bashfulness must have prevented Mr. 
 F. 
 D. 
 from mention-ing the well-known names of the supporters of this “pro-foundly erroneous” idea! But actually concealment of the truth benefits only the opponents of the working class! Thus, the views of the conciliators are “profoundly er-roneous”. 
 Why is that? In answering this question Mr. 
 F. 
 D. 
 winds the veil thrice round his bashful face. 
 “It will explode,” he says, “it will lead to collapse”, “ be the differences great or small !” The words quoted in italics give Mr. 
 F. 
 D. 
 away complete-ly. 
 Murder will out, however you “veil” it. 
 With the full candour you reveal, Mr. 
 F. 
 D. 
, your petty evasions are useless and ridiculous. 
 Are the differences negligible , or are they not negligible ? Give us a straight an-swer. 
 There is no middle course, for the point at issue iswhether unity is possible (yes, it is possible if the differences are negligible, or small) or impossible ( no, it is impossible if the differences are not “negligible”). 
 In condemning the “negligible” differences, Mr. 
 F. 
 D. 
 admitted thereby that the disagreements are important. 
 But he was afraid to say so openly (what would the “Seven” 58 say? What would Trotsky, the Bundists, An,59 and all the conciliators say?). 
 He tried to wrap his answer in a long-winded and deadly dull discourse on the second point of view on unity. 
 But even in this long-winded discourse it is not difficult to get to the heart of the matter: “This platform [i. 
e. 
, the one that Mr. 
 F. 
 D. 
 considers desirable and acceptable] must ensure the non-Leninists full opportunity, with-in the united Social-Democratic Party, to campaign and fight forthe open existence of Social-Democracy. 
” Enough! Quite enough, Mr. 
 F. 
 D. 
! This is the real gist of the matter, not phrases or declamations. 
 To ensure the liquidators full opportunity to fight the “underground”—that is what Mr. 
 F. 
 D. 
’s “platform” amounts to, since everybody understands perfectly well that the fig-leaf of a “fight for open existence ” is intended to cover up the fight against the “underground”, which all workers knowis being waged. 
 That is the crux of the matter, and all those Tro-tskys, Ans, Bundists; conciliators, “Sevens”, and so forth, are nice people, but political nonentities. 
 The heart of the matter is in Mr. 
 F. 
 D. 
’s group, the “old” group of liqui-dators. 
 The Marxist organisation’s differences with this group are absolutely irreconcilable, for agreement (let aloneunity), not only with those who repudiate the “underground”, but even with those who have any doubts on that score, is totally out of the question. 
 The workers have long realisedthat this is the crux of the matter as far as the liquidatorsare concerned, for they dismissed the latter from office in all fields of the working-class movement. 
 There was a time when the Marxist organisation condemned the liquidators (1908-09). 
 That time has long passed away. 
 There was a time when the Marxist organisation proclaimedforgiveness and peace to all who were prepared to renounceliquidationism (1910-11). 
 That time has long ago passedaway. 
 There was a time when the Marxists re-establishedtheir organisation, in opposition to the liquidators (1912-13). 
 That time, too, has passed away. 
 Then came a time when the Marxist organisation won over the overwhelming majority of the class-conscious workers, in opposition to all and sundryliquidators together with their allies. 
 This has been proved by incontrovertible facts. 
 The pro-portion of Bolshevik deputies elected by the worker curia rose from 47 per cent in the Second Duma elections to 50 per cent in the Third Duma elections, and to 67 per cent inthe Fourth Duma elections (autumn 1912). 
 In the courseof 21 months, between January 1, 1912 and October 1, 1913,the Party rallied two thousand workers’ groups, while the liquidators and all their allies united only five hundred . 
 Not only have Mr. 
 F. 
 D. 
 and his friends made no attempt to refute these incontrovertible facts, but they themselves , speaking through Mr. 
 Rakitin in the columns of Nasha Zarya ,60 have admitted that the masses of the workers support the Bolsheviks. 
 Clearly, anyone who offers the Marxist organisation a “platform” giving the liquidators “every opportunity” toliquidate that organisation—anyone who, “in the nameof unity”, flouts the will of the vast majority of the class-conscious workers, is simply making a mockery of “unity”. 
 Do you want unity? Then renounce liquidationism un-equivocally, renounce the “fight for open existence”, and submit loyally to the majority. 
 You do not want unity?You may please yourself, but do not complain if, in a fewmonths’ time, you will have no worker following left at all,and you will have become not “near-Party” but “near-Cadet”intellectuals.

 A CONTRIBUTION TO THE HISTORY OF THE NATIONAL PROGRAMME IN AUSTRIA AND IN RUSSIA In Austria the national programme of the Social-Demo-cratic Party was discussed and adopted at the Brünn Congress in 1899. 
 There is a very widespread but mistaken opinion that this Congress adopted what is known as “cultural-nation-al autonomy”. 
 The reverse is true: the latter was unani-mously rejected there. 
 The South-Slav Social-Democrats submitted to the Brünn Congress (see p. 
 XV of the official Minutes of the Congress in German) a programme of cultural-national autonomy worded as follows: (§2) “every nation inhabiting Austria, irrespective of the territory on which its members reside , shall constitute an autonomous group which shall quite independently administer all its national (languageand cultural) affairs”. 
 The words underlined by us clearly express the gist of “cultural-national autonomy” (otherwise called extra-ter-ritorial). 
 The state is to perpetuate the delimitation of na-tions in educational and similar affairs, and every citizenis free to register with any nation he pleases. 
 At the Congress this programme was defended both by Kristan and the influential Ellenbogen. 
 It was later with-drawn, however. 
 Not a single vote was cast for it. 
 Victor Adler, the Party’s leader, said, “... I doubt whether anybody would at present consider this plan practicable” (p. 
 82 of the Minutes). 
 One of the arguments against it, on principle, was ad-vanced by Preussler, who said: “The proposals tabled bycomrades Kristan and Ellenbogen would result in chau-vinism being perpetuated and introduced into every tiny community, into every tiny group” (ibid. 
, p. 
 92). 
 Clause 3 of the Brünn Congress programme relevant to this subject reads as follows: “The self-governing regions of a given nation shall form a single national association which shall settle all its national affairs quite autonomously. 
” This is a territorialist programme which directly pre-cludes , for example, Jewish cultural-national autonomy. 
 Otto Bauer, the principal theoretician of “cultural-national autonomy”, devoted a special chapter of his book (1907) to proving that “cultural-national autonomy” for the Jewscould not be demanded. 
 We would mention on this issue that Marxists stand for full freedom of association, including the association of any national regions (uyezds, volosts, villages, and so forth); but Social-Democrats cannot possibly agree to hav-ing statutory recognition given to single national associ-ations within the state. 
 In Russia, as it happens, all the Jewish bourgeois parties (as well as the Bund, which actually follows in their wake) adopted the programme of “extra-territorial (cultural-na-tional) autonomy”, which was rejected by all the Austriantheoreticians and by the Congress of the Austrian Social-Democratic Party! This fact, which the Bundists for quite obvious reasons have often tried to deny, can be easily verified by a reference to the well-known book, Forms of the National Movement (St. 
 Petersburg, 1910)—see also Prosveshcheniye No. 
 3, 1913. 
 This fact clearly shows that the more backward and more petty-bourgeois social structure of Russia has resulted insome of the Marxists becoming much more infected with bourgeois nationalism. 
 The Bund’s nationalist vacillations were formally and unequivocally condemned long ago by the Second (1903) Congress, which flatly rejected the amendment moved by the Bundist Goldblatt on “the setting up of institutionsguaranteeing freedom of development for the nationalities” (a pseudonym for “cultural-national autonomy”). 
 When, at the August 1912 Conference of liquidators, the Caucasian Mensheviks, who until then had for decades been strenuously fighting the Bund, themselves slipped into nationalism, under the influence of the entire nationalist atmosphere of the counter-revolution, the Bolsheviks were not the only ones to condemn them. 
 The Caucasian Menshe-viks were also emphatically condemned by the MenshevikPlekhanov, who described their decision as “the adaptationof socialism to nationalism”. 
 “The Caucasian comrades,” Plekhanov wrote, “who have begun to talk about cultural autonomy instead of political autonomy, havemerely certified the fact that they have unwisely submitted to the hegemony of the Bund. 
” Besides the Jewish bourgeois parties, the Bund and the liquidators, “cultural-national autonomy” was adopted onlyby the conference of the petty-bourgeois national parties of the Left-Narodnik trend. 
 But even here four parties (the Jewish Socialist Labour Party; the Byelorussian Hromada;the Dashnaktsutyun and the Georgian Socialists-Federal-ists 61), adopted this programme, while the two largest parties abstained from voting : these were the Russian Left Narodniks and the Polish “Fracy” (P. 
S. 
P. 
)! The Russian Left Narodniks expressed particular opposi-tion to the compulsory , legal-state associations of national-ities proposed in the famous Bund plan. 
 From this brief historical survey it is clear why both the February and the summer conferences of Marxists in 1913emphatically condemned the petty-bourgeois and national-ist idea of “cultural-national autonomy”.

 A HIGHBORN LIBERAL LANDLORD ON THE “NEW ZEMSTVO RUSSIA ” Deafened by liberal catch-phrases, people in our country are apt to overlook the actual class stand of the liberal par-ty’s real bosses. 
 In Russkaya Mysl No. 
 12, Prince Yevgeny Trubetskoi has splendidly revealed this stand and strikingly shown to what extent liberal landlords like the Trubetskois,and reactionary landlords like the Purishkeviches havedrawn closer together on all important issues. 
 Stolypin’s agrarian policy 62 is one such momentous issue. 
 The highborn liberal landlord has this to say of it: “Ever since Stolypin became Premier, the government’s entire concern for the countryside has been prompted largely by two mo-tives: fear of Pugachovism, 63 which caused so much trouble in 1905, and the desire to offset it with a new type of peasant—one who is well-to-do and therefore cherishes private property, one who will not besusceptible to revolutionary propaganda.... 
” By the very use of the word “Pugachovism” our liberal reveals that he is at one with the Purishkeviches. 
 Theonly difference is that the Purishkeviches utter this wordferociously and menacingly, whereas the Trubetskois pro-nounce it in the dulcet and sugary Manilov manner, 64 to the accompaniment of phrases about culture, disgustingly hypo-critical exclamations about the “new peasant communities” and the “democratisation of the countryside”, and patheticspeeches on things divine. 
 Owing to the new agrarian policy, the peasant bourgeoisie is growing much faster than before. 
 There is no questionabout that. 
 The peasant bourgeoisie in Russia cannot help growing whatever the political and agrarian system may be, because Russia is a capitalist country which has beencompletely drawn into the orbit of world capitalism. 
 His Liberal Highness would have known this had he possessed at least an elementary knowledge of the “fundamental prin-ciples of Marxism”, of which he speaks with such boundless aplomb and with equally boundless ignorance. 
 But His Highness exerts every effort to obscure the fundamentalquestion of what the development of capitalism is likewithout any Purishkeviches, and what it is like with their class in complete power. 
 His Highness goes into ecstasies over the progress of co-operation, fodder grass cultiva-tion, and “growing prosperity”; but he does not say a wordabout the high cost of living, the mass pauperisation of thepeasants, their desperate poverty and starvation, aboutlabour rent, and so forth. 
 His Highness sees that the “peas-ants are turning bourgeois”, and goes into raptures over it, but our liberal landlord turns a blind eye to the fact that they are becoming wage-labourers under conditions in whichthe relations of feudal bondage are preserved. 
 “The intelligentsia’s first contact with the broad masses of the peasantry,” he writes, “took place as far back as 1905, but at that time it bore an altogether different character; it was destructive rather thanconstructive. 
 At that time the affiliation was established solely forthe purpose of destroying the old forms of life, and was therefore su-perficial. 
 The demagogue intellectual did not imbue the peasants’minds and peasant life with his own independent ideas; if anything, he himself was guided by the instincts of the masses of the people. 
 He flattered them and adapted his party programme and tacticsto them. 
” Familiar Purishkevich-style talk! A little example: if eighty peasant homesteads of twenty-five dessiatines eachare set up on 2,000 dessiatines of the Trubetskois’ land,that will be “destructive”; but if a score or so of such home-steads are set up on the land of the pauperised village-commune peasants, that will be “constructive”. 
 Is that not so, Your Highness? Don’t you realise that in the first in-stance, Russia would really be “bourgeois-democratic”,and in the second she would remain Purishkevichian fordecades to come? However, shying away from unpleasant questions, the highborn liberal assures his readers that the big landowners, who are selling their land, will “soon, very soon” disappearentirely. 
 “If, by its measures, the government does not accelerate the fu-ture revolution excessively, ‘compulsory alienation’ will no longerbe a problem when that revolution does come, as there will be almostnothing left to alienate. 
” According to the latest statistics of the Ministry of the Interior,65 30,000 landlords owned 70,000,000 dessiatines of land in 1905, while a similar area was owned by 10,000,000 peasants. 
 But that does not concern the highborn liberal inthe least! He assures his readers that the Purishkevicheswill disappear very “soon”, because he wishes to defend thePurishkeviches. 
 The only thing that really interests him isthat: “there will be in the countryside enough people interested in private property to counter, not only Pugachov propaganda, butsocialist propaganda in all its forms”. 
 Thanks for being so candid! “What will the result be?” the liberal prince asks. 
 “Will the govern-ment, with the aid of the intelligentsia [who are joining co-operativesocieties, etc. 
], re-educate the peasants to become loyal petty landedproprietors, or, on the contrary, will the intelligentsia educate them with the aid of government loans?” The prince anticipates neither of these alternatives. 
 But that is merely a hypocritical turn of speech. 
 Actually, aswe have seen, he stands heart and soul for peasants being re-educated to become “loyal petty landed proprietors”, and assures us that “the intelligentsia is coming down toearth”, and that there will be no room for the “demagogicagrarian programme” of the socialists (which, in the opinionof His Highness, runs counter to the “fundamental princi-ples of Marxism”. 
 Don’t laugh, reader!). 
 That a landlord should entertain such views is not sur-prising. 
 Neither is his indignation at the growth of atheismsurprising, or his pious speeches. 
 What is surprising is thatthere are still foolish people in Russia who do not understandthat while such landlords and such politicians set the tonein the liberal party, including the Cadet Party, it is ridic-ulous to hope that the people’s interests can be really de-fended “with the co-operation” of the liberals and the Cadets. 
 Put Pravdy No. 
 13, Published according to February 5, 1914 the text in Put Pravdy NARODISM AND THE CLASS OF WAGE -WORKERS The tenth anniversary of the death of the liberal-Narod-nik writer Mikhailovsky has provided the Narodniks with a pretext for reviving the old dispute about the significance of the Marxists’ struggle against the Narodniks. 
 That dis-pute is of no little interest: first, historically, since the riseof Marxism in Russia was the point at issue; second, theo-retically, since the dispute concerned the fundamental ques-tions of Marxist theory; and third, practically, inasmuch as the Left-Narodnik newspaper in St. 
 Petersburg is trying to win the workers over to its side. 
 Mr. 
 Rakitnikov, the Na-rodnik, writes: “Nobody, of course, now puts the case the way it was put in the sixties and seventies, viz. 
, whether Russia can avoid the phase ofcapitalism. 
 Russia is already in that phase. 
” This interesting statement by a Left Narodnik brings us straightaway to the gist of the matter. 
 Is it true that thequestion as to whether “Russia can avoid the phase of capi-talism” was discussed only in the sixties and seventies?No. 
 It is absolutely untrue. 
 This question was discussed by the Narodniks in general, and by the contributors to Rus-skoye Bogatstvo 66 (i. 
e. 
, members of Mikhailovsky’s group) in particular, both in the eighties and the nineties. 
 It issufficient to mention Mr. 
 Nikolai—on, 67 for example. 
 Why then, did Mr. 
 Rakitnikov conceal the eighties and the nineties from his readers? Was it merely to cover up the Narodniks’ errors, and thus help to spread them among the workers? This is a shabby trick, and things must be goingbad with those who resort to such tricks. 
 What are the implications of the theory that “Russia can avoid the phase of capitalism”, a theory that was propounded by Mikhailovsky and his group, and survived right down to the nineties of the last century? That was the theory of utopian, petty-bourgeois socialism, i. 
e. 
, the dream of petty-bourgeois intellectuals, who sought a way of escape from capitalism not in the wage-workers ’ class struggle against the bourgeoisie, but in appeals to the “entire nation”, to “society”, that is , to that very same bour-geoisie . 
 Prior to the rise of the working-class movement, such theo-ries of “socialism” were prevalent in all countries and theymerely reflected in fact the hopes of petty-bourgeois theore-ticians that the class struggle could be avoided, dispensed with. 
 In all countries, as in Russia, the class-conscious work-ing-class movement had to wage a persistent struggleagainst these petty-bourgeois doctrines of “socialism” whichwere in keeping with the status and point of view of the pettyproprietors. 
 The working-class movement cannot exist or develop successfully until this theory of the benevolent petty pro-prietors regarding the possibility of “avoiding” capitalismis refuted. 
 By covering up the fundamental mistake of theMikhailovsky group, Mr. 
 Rakitnikov is bringing confusioninto the theory of the class struggle . 
 Nevertheless it is this theory alone that has shown the workers the way out of their present conditions, shown how the workers themselves can and should endeavour to achieve their emancipa-tion. 
 “Russia is already in the phase of capitalism,” writes Mr. 
 Rakitnikov. 
 This remarkable admission is tantamount to admitting the fundamental error of Mikhailovsky and his group. 
 Moreover, it is tantamount to a complete renunciation of Narodism. 
 The Left Narodniks who are in agreement with this ad-mission are now fighting the Marxists not as Narodniks, butas opportunists in the socialist movement, as supporters of petty-bourgeois deviations from socialism. 
 Indeed, if “Russia is already in the phase of capitalism”, it follows that Russia is a capitalist country. 
 It follows that in Russia, as in all capitalist countries, the petty proprietors , including the peasants, are petty bourgeois. 
 It follows that in Russia, as in all capitalist countries, the wage-workers’ class struggle against the bourgeoisie is the only way inwhich socialism can be achieved. 
 To this day the programme of the Left Narodniks (not to mention their Russkoye Bogatstvo friends) dares not admit that Russia is a capitalist country. 
 Mr. 
 Rakitnikov defends Narodism by surrendering the Narodniks’ programme to the Marxists! A poor defence! Mr. 
 Rakitnikov argues with the Marxists not like a Narod-nik but like an opportunist when he says: “to support peasant farming does not mean battling against the stream of inexorable economic development. 
 And an increasing number of socialists in the West is adopting this point of view . 
” We have emphasised the words that completely betray our poor “Left Narodnik”! We know that in the West theclass of wage-workers alone has been able as a class to form socialist parties. 
 We know that in the West the peas-antry as a class forms, not socialist but bourgeois par-ties. 
 We know that it is not the socialists, but the op-portunists in the West who support petty-bourgeois farm-ing. 
 “To support peasant farming !...” L ook about you. 
 Peasant proprietors are forming associations to market grain, hay, milk and meat at the highest prices, and to hire labour at the lowest. 
 The freer the peasants are and the more land theypossess, the clearer do we see this. 
 Mr. 
 Rakitnikov is trying to persuade the class of wage-workers to “support petty-bourgeois farming”. 
 A fine sort of“socialism”, indeed! The wage-workers support only the peasants’ struggle against the feudalists and the serf-like conditions, but thatis quite different from what Mr. 
 Rakitnikov wants. 
 In Russia, the great years of 1905-07 definitely proved that the wage-workers were the only class to act and rallyas a socialist force. 
 The peasantry acted and rallied as a bourgeois-democratic force. 
 With the development of capi-talism the difference between the classes becomes moremarked from day to day. 
 “Left-Narodnik” propaganda amounts, in effect, to the corruption and disruption of the wage-workers’ class move-ment with the aid of petty-bourgeois slogans. 
 The Left Narodniks would be well advised to turn to democraticwork among the peasants—that is something which evennon-socialists can do.

 MORE ABOUT “NATIONALISM ” “In our day”, when attempts are being made to stage anoth-er Beilis case, the nationalists’ propaganda could bear more frequent scrutiny. 
 The nature of this propaganda was re-vealed with striking clarity at the recent second congressof representatives of the “All-Russia National Association”. 
 It would be highly erroneous to think that the signif-icance of this propaganda is negligible inasmuch as thisentire “All-Russia Association”, which was representedonly by 21 delegates from all over Russia, is negligible andfictitious, a mere shadow. 
 The “All-Russia National Asso-ciation” is insignificant and a shadow, but its propaganda is backed by all the parties of the right and by all the official institutions; its propaganda is conducted in every village school, in every military barrack, and in every church. 
 The following is a press report of a paper read at this con-gress on February 2. 
 “Savenko, a member of the Duma, read a paper on ‘Mazeppism’ ,68 as the Ukrainian movement is called in the jargon of the nationalists. 
 Savenko expressed the opinion that the separatist tendencies [i. 
e. 
,for secession from the state] among the Byelorussians and the Ukrai-nians were particularly dangerous. 
 The Ukrainian movement con-stituted a specially great and real menace to the integrity of Russia. 
The immediate programme of the Ukrainians was federalism and Uk-rainian autonomy. 
 “The Ukrainians linked their hopes of autonomy with the defeat of Russia in a future war with Austria-Hungary and Germany. 
 On the ruins of Great Russia an autonomous Poland and an autonomousUkraine would be founded under the sceptre of the Habsburgs andwithin the boundaries of Austria-Hungary. 
 “If the Ukrainians really succeeded in tearing their 30,000,000 away from the Russian people, it would mean the end of the Great-Russian Empire. 
 ( Applause . 
)” Why is this “federalism” no obstacle to the integrity of the United States, or of Switzerland? Why is “autonomy” /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR no obstacle to the integrity of Austria-Hungary? Why has “autonomy” even cemented the ties between Britain and many of her colonies for a long time to come? Mr. 
 Savenko has presented his case for “nationalism” in such a ridiculous light that he has made it extremely easyto refute his ideas. 
 The integrity of Russia, if you please,is “menaced” by the autonomy of the Ukraine, whereas theintegrity of Austria-Hungary is cemented by universal suffrage and the autonomy of her various regions! Is not this very strange? Will it not occur to those who read and hear this“nationalist” propaganda to ask why it is impossible tocement the integrity of Russia by granting autonomy to the Ukraine? By persecuting “subject peoples”, the landlord and bour-geois nationalists try to split and corrupt the working class the better to be able to dope it. 
 The class-conscious workersretaliate by demanding complete equality and unity for the workers of all nationalities in practice . 
 In declaring the Byelorussians and Ukrainians to be subject peoples, the nationalist gentry forget to add that the Great Russians (the only non-“aliens” in Russia) constitute only 43 per cent of the population. 
 Hence, the “subject peoples” arein the majority! How then can the minority keep its hold onthe majority if it offers the latter no benefits , the benefits of political freedom, national equality, and local and regionalautonomy? By persecuting the Ukrainians and others for their “sep-aratism”, for their secessionist strivings, the nationalistsare upholding the privilege of the Great-Russian landlords and the Great-Russian bourgeoisie to have “their own” state. 
The working class is opposed to all privileges; that is why it upholds the right of nations to self-determination. 
 The class-conscious workers do not advocate secession . 
 They know the advantages of large states and the amalgama-tion of large masses of workers. 
 But large states can be dem-ocratic only if there is complete equality among the na-tions; that equality implies the right to secede. 
 The struggle against national oppression and national priv-ileges is inseparably bound up with the defence of that right. 
 Put Pravdy No. 
 17, Published according to February 20, 1914 the text in Put Pravdy THE PEASANTRY AND HIRED LABOUR No phrase has been worked harder among the Narodniks than that about the Marxists “setting the working people bythe ears” by drawing a line between the hired workers and thepeasants and pitting one class against the other. 
 And nophrase is more mendacious, serving as it does to cover updefence of the interests of the small proprietor, the petty bourgeois; the exploiter of the hired labourer. 
 The following interesting data are from the Moscow Zem-stvo Statistics published in 1913 ( A Handbook of Economic Statistics , Vol. 
 VII, Moscow, 1913). 
 The Moscow statisticians investigated fruit and vegetable gardening in Moscow Uyezd. 
The investigation covered over 5,000 households, which the statisticians divided into seven districts according to their proximity to Moscow and the degree of intensity of culti-vation (i. 
e. 
, expenditure of a large amount of capital andlabour on each dessiatine of land). 
 The employment of hired labourers by the peasants was investigated in fairly great detail. 
 What is the result? In the first four districts the number of households employ-ing labour is 67 per cent (i. 
e. 
, over two-thirds of the totalnumber of households); in the remaining districts it rangesfrom 43 to 64 per cent. 
 Hence it is evident that the overwhelm-ing majority of the peasant households near Moscow arethe farms of petty capitalists who hire labourers. 
 Still more interesting are the figures showing the number of households which employ labourers by the year or season. 
The percentages of such households are as follows: District I .... 
. 
 26. 
6 per cent ” II.... 
. 
 16. 
7 ”” ” III....

0 ”” ” V.... 
. 
 9. 
9 ”” ” VI.... 
. 
 5. 
0 ”” ” VII .... 
. 
 6. 
4 ”” As a rule, the more intensive a given district, the higher is the percentage of peasants who employ labourers by the year and the season. 
 The figures covering entire districts, however, lump to-gether the poor and the rich peasants in each district. 
 Hence,they are only very rough figures which give a varnished picture, for they cover up the contrasts between poverty and wealth, between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. 
 Let us take the figures for the groups of farms classified according to amount of land held in tenure (i. 
e. 
, amount ofland under cultivation). 
 These figures are far more reliablethan the figures of allotment land ownership, which to thisday, even around Moscow , retains its feudal-bureaucratic character. 
 Among the peasants who own small allotments there are rich peasants who lease land. 
 And among the peas-ants who own large allotments there are poor peasants whorent out their allotments, and landless or rather non-farmingpeasants. 
 In all districts the percentage of non-farming peasants who employ labourers is nil. 
 That is natural. 
 The non-farming peasant is himself a proletarian. 
 Peasants with farms of under half a dessiatine: the percen-tage of households employing labourers ranges from 0 to 57(we are taking one of the three subgroups, so as not to com-plicate the question). 
 Farmers with between one half and one dessiatine: the percentage of households employing labourers ranges from 0 to 100. 
 Farmers with one to three dessiatines: the percentage of households employing labourers ranges from 46 to 100 (indifferent districts). 
 Farmers with from three to five dessiatines: the percen-tage of households employing labourers ranges from 66 to 97. 
 Farmers with from five to ten dessiatines: the percentage of households employing labourers ranges from 75 to 100. 
 From this we clearly see that the non-farming peasants are themselves proletarians (hired labourers). 
 The larger the farm, the more often is hired labour exploited. 
 Even among the farmers who have from three to five dessiatines, no less than two-thirds of the total exploit hired labour! Such is the plain, well-known and obvious fact, which the Narodniks try to distort. 
 What is true of the Moscow area is true, to a lesser degree, of all other places. 
 Everyone knows that every town and every mile of railway draw peasant economy into the orbit of commerce and capitalism. 
The “Left Narodniks” are the only ones who refuse to see thetruth, which explodes their petty-bourgeois theory. 
 That truth is that every mile of railway, every new shop that is opened in the village, every co-operative society that is formed to make buying easier, every factory, and so forth, draw peasant economy into the orbit of commerce. 
 Andthat means that the peasantry is breaking up into prole-tarians, and proprietors employing hired labourers. 
 There can be no improvement in peasant economy that does not involve an increase in the exploitation of hired labour on the improved farms. 
 That is why the Marxists defend the interests of labour— and they are the only ones to do so—by distinguishing theproletarians, the hired workers, both in town and coun-tryside. 
 The Narodniks, on the other hand, defend (in practice) the interests of the exploiters of hired labour when they talk about the “peasantry” and “peasant economy”, for the morethe peasant resembles a “proprietor”, the more he exploits hired labour. 
 It is in the interests of the bourgeoisie (in whose footsteps the Narodniks blindly follow) to confuse the peasant prole-tariat with the peasant bourgeoisie. 
 It is in the interests of the proletariat to combat this con-fusion and to draw a clear line between classes everywhere , including the peasantry. 
 It is useless deceiving oneself andothers by talking about the “peasantry”. 
 We should our-selves learn and teach the peasants that even among the peasantry the gulf between the proletariat and the bour-geoisie is widening day by day.

 MR. 
 STRUVE ON THE NEED TO “REFORM THE GOVERNMENT ” Mr. 
 Struve is one of the most outspoken of the counter-revolutionary liberals. 
 It is often very instructive, there-fore, to lend an ear to the political comments of a writer who is a striking illustration of the correctness of theMarxian analysis of opportunism (for Mr. 
 Struve, as we know,began with opportunism, with a “criticism of Marxism”, andin a few years fell as low as counter-revolutionary, bour-geois national-liberalism). 
 In the January issue of Russkaya Mysl , Mr. 
 Struve dis-cussed the need “to reform the government”. 
 In the firstplace, he admits the failure of the Stolypin policy, 69 a s well as of the entire reaction of 1907-14 and Octobrism. 
70 Reaction “faces a crisis”, writes Mr. 
 Struve. 
 In his opinion,attempts at back-pedalling reforms, such as turning the Duma into a legislative-consultative body, will “put the government in the same position it was in before 1905”, withthis important difference, however, that the people havechanged since then. 
 “In 1905 the sympathies and instinctsof the masses swung over to the intelligentsia. 
” This is written by a Vekhist, 71 a fervent opponent of revolution and an exponent of the most obscurantist theories. 
 Even he is compelled to admit that the masses have swung to the left; but this liberal dares not say more plainly, clear-ly and exactly which classes among these masses havealigned themselves with which parties. 
 “Our people has not taken shape yet, has not yet separated into its elements. 
 The fact that it has been conservative for such a longtime and gone revolutionary overnight, as it were, does not tell uswhat it will become when all its latent potentialities will have de-veloped. 
” This is a specimen of the phrase-mongering with which the bourgeoisie covers up unpalatable truths. 
 Obviously, what is implied here by the term people is the peasantry, since the bourgeoisie (let alone the landlords) and the workingclass have sufficiently taken shape, and are sufficientlydifferentiated. 
 The liberal dares not in so many words admitthat the bourgeois peasantry “has not yet taken shape”, despite the frantic efforts of the new agrarian policy. 
 “What is the way out of the present situation?” Mr. 
 Struve asks, and replies: “There is only a single alternative: eithersteadily increasing political unrest, in which the middleclasses and the moderate elements that represent them ...[so the moderate elements “represent” the middle classes?This is not very intelligent but politically it is fairly clear; which elements, then, “represent” the peasantry and the workers?] will again be pushed into the background by theelemental pressure of the popular masses who will be in-spired by the extreme elements, or, the reform of government . 
 We shall not deal here with the first way out. 
 Under the con-ditions prevailing in Russia we definitely adhere to the point of view that it is impossible for us either to work effectively towards such a solution, or even simply to desire it .... 
” (Thank you for being so candid, Mr. 
 Struve! Our liquidatorscould well take a lesson in plain-speaking and candour fromthis man, instead of beating about the bush the way L. 
 M. 
does in the January issue of Nasha Zarya . 
) “It is left for us to suggest to the public mind the second way out as being an urgent problem which has to be solved by the joint effortsof all progressive and, at the same time, preservatory forces. 
” Of this second way out Mr. 
 Struve has absolutely nothing to say except empty phrases. 
 The bourgeoisie is for moderation, the masses are for “extremes”—this the liberal is compelledto admit. 
 As to what the social structure of the reformable“government” must be, what its class basis should be, andwhat has become of the landlords who reigned and governed unchallenged prior to the bourgeoisie—of all this Mr. 
 Struve dares not even think. 
 Helplessness, impotence and completelack of principles and ideals—such are the inevitable features of the liberal bourgeoisie so long as it fawns (as Messrs. 
 Struve and Co. 
 do) on the Purishkeviches. 
 “Strange as it may appear,” Mr. 
 Struve writes, “there is nothing that we could wish the government more than that it should forgetthat there ever were events, facts and moods which we are accustomedto call the Russian revolution. 
” Splendid, profound, wise, and earnest political advice! Let the “government forget”. 
 After all, aged people do some-times forget what is happening to them and around them! The spokesmen of senile Russian liberalism measure others with their own yardstick.

 K. 
 Mikhailovsky (who died on January 28, 1904) was marked by a spate oflaudatory articles in the liberal-bourgeois and Narodnik (i.

 It is not surprising that the liberals and bourgeois democrats laud N. 
 K. 
 Mikhai-lovsky, but one cannot help protesting against the flagrantdistortion of the truth and the corruption of proletarianclass-consciousness when attempts are made to pass Mikhai-lovsky off as a socialist and to prove that his bourgeois philosophy and sociology are compatible with Marxism. 
 Mikhailovsky was one of the finest spokesmen of Russian bourgeois democracy in the latter third of the last century. 
The masses of the peasantry, who (not counting the urbanpetty bourgeoisie) are the only important and mass vehiclesof bourgeois-democratic ideas in Russia, were then still dormant. 
 The best people from their midst, and those who deeply sympathised with their hard lot, the raznochintsi (mostly students, teachers and other intellectuals), tried toenlighten and rouse the dormant peasant masses. 
 The historic service that Mikhailovsky rendered the bourgeois-democratic movement for the liberation of Russia was that he warmly sympathised with the hard lot of the peasants, strenuously combated all manifestations of feudaltyranny, advocated in the legal, open press—if only byhints—sympathy and respect for the “underground”, wherethe most consistent and determined raznochintsi democrats operated, and even gave direct personal help to the “under-ground”. 
 Today, when not only liberals but also liquida-tors, both Narodnik ( Russkoye Bogatstvo ) and Marxist, betray a shameless and often renegade attitude towards the “underground”, one cannot help putting in a good word in memory of the service rendered by Mikhailovsky. 
 Though he was an ardent champion of freedom and of the oppressed masses of the peasantry, Mikhailovsky shared allthe weaknesses of the bourgeois-democratic movement. 
 Hethought there was something “socialistic” in the idea oftransferring all the land to the peasants, especially withoutredemption, and therefore considered himself a “socialist”. 
 Of course, this was a profound error, which was fully revealed by Marx and by the experience of all civilised countries, where, until the complete collapse of serf-ownership andabsolutism, the bourgeois democrats constantly imagined themselves to be “socialists”. 
 The transfer of all the land tothe peasants, particularly on the terms indicated, is a very useful measure under the rule of the feudal-minded landlords, but it is a bourgeois-democratic measure. 
 Today every sen-sible socialist is aware of that. 
 The experience of all the worldgoes to show that the more land (and the cheaper) the peas-ants have received from the feudalists, the more “land andliberty” there has been, the more rapidly capitalism has developed and the more speedily the bourgeois nature of the peasants has been revealed. 
 If Mr. 
 N. 
 Rakitnikov (in issueNo. 
 3 of Vernaya Mysl 72) has not yet realised that the pro-letariat’s support of the bourgeois -democratic peasants against the feudal landlords is not socialism at all, one canonly smile at his simplicity. 
 It is a dull business refuting errors that have long been refuted by all class-conscious workers. 
 Not only in the field of economics, but also in those of philosophy and sociology, Mikhailovsky’s views werebourgeois-democratic views veiled by quasi-socialist phrases. 
 Such were his “progress formula”, his “struggle for individ-uality” theory and so on. 
 In philosophy Mikhailovsky was a step backward from Chernyshevsky, the greatest exponent of utopian socialism in Russia. 
 Chernyshevsky was a mate-rialist, and to the end of his days (i. 
e. 
, until the eightiesof the nineteenth century) he ridiculed the petty concessionsto idealism and mysticism that were made by the then fashionable “positivists” (Kantians, Machists, and so forth). 
 And Mikhailovsky trailed in the wake of these very positiv-ists. 
 To this very day, these reactionary philosophical views prevail among Mikhailovsky’s disciples, even among the extreme “Left” Narodniks (such as Mr. 
 Chernov). 
 That the “socialism” of Mikhailovsky and the Narodniks is mere bourgeois-democratic phrase-mongering was con-clusively proved by the actions of all classes and their massstruggle in 1905-07. 
 Most of the peasant deputies in the Firstand Second Dumas sided, not with the Left Narodniks, but with the “Trudoviks” 73 and the “Popular Socialists”. 
74 This is a fact that must not be forgotten or distorted. 
 And,following the Marxists, even the Left Narodniks, in the per-sons for example of Vikhlayev, Chernov, and others, havebeen compelled to admit the bourgeois nature of the TrudovikPopular Socialists! Let individual workers who sympathise with the Left Narodniks ask their teachers to produce everything the Left Narodniks wrote against the Trudovik Popular Socialists in 1906-07. 
 In those years mass action by the peasants proved conclu-sively that the peasantry takes a bourgeois-democratic stand. 
 The Left Narodniks are at best only a small wing of peasant (i. 
e. 
, bourgeois) democracy in Russia. 
 The workers have supported the peasants (against the feudal landlords),and will continue to do so, but to confuse these classes, toconfuse bourgeois democracy with the socialist proletariat,is reactionary adventurism. 
 All class-conscious workers willstrenuously combat this, particularly at the present time when the class cleavage has been made quite clear by the great experience of the mass struggle of 1905-07, and is be-coming clearer day by day in our rural districts. 
 For a very long time, over ten years in fact, Mikhailovsky was the head and guiding spirit of the Russkoye Bogatstvo publicist group. 
 What did this group produce in the great days of 1905-07? It produced the first liquidators among the democrats!Let individual workers who sympathise with the Left Narodniks ask their teachers to show them Russkoye Bogat-stvo for August 1906, and all that was written by the Left Narodniks when they called this group “Social-Cadets”, and so forth! The Mikhailovsky group brought forth the first liquida-tors who, in the autumn of 1906, proclaimed an “open party”, and renounced the “underground” and its slogans two or three years before our Marxist liquidators did so. 
 What came of the “open party” proclaimed by the Myakotins, Peshe-khonovs, and other associates of Mikhailovsky? Nothing—the complete absence of any party whatsoever, and the com-plete isolation of the “open” group of opportunist Narodniksfrom the masses. 
 Mikhailovsky, who never renounced the “underground” (or rather, died shortly before his group went over to liquidationism), should not be held fully responsible for thepaltry and contemptible opportunism of Messrs. 
 Peshekho-nov, Myakotin and Co. 
 But is it not characteristic that inissue No. 
 3 of Vernaya Mysl , which is dedicated to Mikhai-lovsky, we again find the corrupt bloc between the “Left” Narodniks and the “Social-Cadets” of Russkoye Bogatstvo ? And if we recall what Mikhailovsky wrote to Lavrov abouthis attitude towards revolutionaries, shall we not have toadmit that, on the whole, the “Social-Cadets” are his faith-ful successors? We pay tribute to Mikhailovsky for the sincere and skilful struggle he waged against the serf-owning system, the “bu-reaucracy” (we beg to be excused for this loose term), and soforth, for his respect for the “underground” and the assistancehe rendered it, but not for his bourgeois-democratic views,or his vacillating tendencies towards liberalism, or his “So-cial-Cadet” group of Russkoye Bogatstvo . 
 It is no accident that the bourgeois democrats in Russia, i. 
e. 
, in the first place the peasantry, vacillate between theliberal bourgeoisie and the proletariat; that is due to theirclass position. 
 It is the workers’ job to liberate the peasantryfrom the influence of the liberals and relentlessly to com-bat “Narodnik” doctrines. 
 Put Pravdy No. 
 19, Published according to February 22, 1914 the text in Put Pravdy Signed: V. 
 Ilyin CONCERNING A. 
 BOGDANOV The editors have received a letter signed by thirteen “Left Bolsheviks” and bearing the address “Tiflis, Caucasus”,asking for our opinion on the question of having A. 
 Bogdanovas a contributor. 
 The signatories call themselves “ideologi-cal adherents of the Vperyod group”, and their tone is openly and definitely hostile to our newspaper. 
 Nevertheless, we consider it necessary to have it out with them once and for all. 
 Why has it become impossible to have A. 
 Bogdanov as a contributor to workers’ newspapers and journals that adhere to a stand of consistent Marxism? Because A. 
 Bogdanov is not a Marxist. 
 The writers of the letter, following the cue given by Bogdanov himself in his letter to the liquidator newspaper,try to account for A. 
 Bogdanov’s disappearance from thecolumns of our newspapers on personal grounds, as being due to personal spite, and so forth. 
 All this is sheer nonsense that is not worth going into or explaining. 
 Everything ismuch simpler and plainer. 
 If the writers of the letter were interested, not in “person-alities”, but in the history of the organisational and ideolog-ical relations among the Marxists, they would know that as far back as May 1909 a delegate meeting of Bolsheviks, after a long and detailed preliminary discussion, rejected all re-sponsibility for A. 
 Bogdanov’s literary-political utterances. 
 75 If the writers of the letter attached less importance to philis-tine scandal and gossip and paid more attention to the ideo-logical struggle among the Marxists, they would know that in his books A. 
 Bogdanov has built up a definite social and philosophical system and that all Marxists, irrespective of group allegiance, have expressed their opposition to this system as being non-Marxist and anti-Marxist. 
 All who are interested in the history of Marxism and the working-class movement in Russia know—and those who do not should make it their business to learn, read and find out—that the question of A. 
 Bogdanov’s contributions to a workers’ news-paper is bound up with a much more important questionof principle, namely, the relation between Marxist philosophyand Bogdanov’s theories. 
 This question has been discussed, examined, and worked to death in books, pamphlets and ar-ticles. 
 The question of a writer’s contributions to the workers’press should be approached from the political angle, i. 
e. 
,not from the point of view of the writer’s style, wit, orpopularising talent, but from that of his general trend,from the point of view of what he is bringing into the working masses by his theories. 
 The Marxists are convinced that the sum of A. 
 Bogdanov’s literary activities amounts toattempts to instil into the consciousness of the proletariatthe touched-up idealistic conceptions of the bourgeoisphilosophers. 
 If anybody thinks that this is not the case and that, in the controversy over the philosophical principles of Marxism, it is not Plekhanov and not Ilyin, 76 but Bogdanov who is right, that person should come out in support of Bogdanov’ssystem, and not argue that one popular article or another ofBogdanov’s ought to be given space in the columns of a work-ers’ newspaper. 
 But we know of no supporters of Bogdanov’s system among Marxists. 
 His theories have been opposed, not only by his “factional” opponents, but also by his former col-leagues in his political group. 
 That is how the matter stands with Bogdanov. 
 His at-tempts to “modify” and “correct” Marxism have been exam-ined by Marxists and recognised as alien to the spirit of the modern working-class movement. 
 The groups he formerly co-operated with have rejected all responsibility for hisliterary and other activities. 
 One can think whatever onepleases about Bogdanov after this, but to demand that he begiven space in the columns of the workers’ press, which iscalled upon to disseminate the elementary principles of Marxism, reveals a failure to understand either Marxism, Bogdanov’s theories, or the task of spreading Marxist educa-tion among the masses of the workers. 
 As regards the business of educating the masses of the workers, to which our newspaper is dedicated, our path and Bogdanov’s diverge, for we differ in our understanding of what that education should be. 
 That is the real issue, which,for self-interested motives, is being obscured by hints aboutpersonal relations. 
 Workers to whom the trend of their news-paper is dear should brush aside as trash all these attemptsto reduce the issue to the “personalities” of certain writers; they must look into the character of Bogdanov’s theories. 
 When they begin to do so they will speedily reach the conclu-sion we have arrived at, namely, that Marxism is one thing,and Bogdanov’s theories are quite another. 
 A workers’ news-paper should clear the minds of the proletariat of bourgeois,idealistic hodge-podge, not offer them this indigestible fare in their columns. 
 We may be told: Nevertheless, Pravda did publish several of Bogdanov’s articles. 
 So it did. 
 But, as everyone now can see, this was a mistake inevi-table in such a new undertaking as the publication of thefirst workers’ newspaper in Russia. 
 The comrades who were in charge at the time had hoped that, in the popular articles which Bogdanov offered the newspaper, propagandaof the ABC of Marxism would overshadow these specific fea-tures of Bogdanov’s theories. 
 As might have been expected,things turned out differently. 
 After the first articles, whichwere more or less neutral, Bogdanov sent in an article in which he obviously attempted to convert the workers’ newspaper into an instrument for the propaganda, not ofMarxism, but of his own empirio-monism. 
 A. 
 Bogdanovevidently attached so much importance to this article thatafter it, i. 
e. 
, since the spring of 1913, he sent in no morearticles. 
 The question of Bogdanov’s contributions became a mat-ter of principle to our editorial board, who settled it in theway our readers already know. 
 Now a word about the Vperyod group. 
 In the columns of our newspaper, it has been called “adventurist”. 
 * Owing to their inability to think politically and not like philistines, the writers of the letter saw in this too an *See p. 
 94 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 insinuation against the personalities of the members of this group. 
 This, too, is absurd. 
 Marxists call “adventurist” the policy pursued by groups that do not take their stand on the basis of scientific socialism, such groups, for instance, as theanarchists, Narodnik terrorists, and so forth. 
 No one willtry to deny that the Vperyod group is leaning towards an-archo-syndicalism, or that they are tolerant of Lunacharsky’s“god-building”, 77 Bogdanov’s idealism, and the doctrinal anarchist proclivities of S. 
 Volsky, and so forth. 
 Insofar as the policy of the Vperyod group has tended towards anarch-ism and syndicalism, every Marxist will call it a policyof adventurism. 
 This is simply a fact, which has been confirmed by the complete break-up of the Vperyod group. 
 As soon as the work-ing-class movement revived, this patchwork group, stitched together from the most heterogeneous elements, without adefinite political line or understanding of the principles ofclass politics and Marxism, fell completely apart. 
 Marching under the banner of Marxism, the working-class movement will ignore these groups, these “empirio-monists”, “god-builders”, “anarchists ”, and the like. 
 Put Pravdy No. 
 21, Published according to February 25, 1914 the text in Put Pravdy EDITORIAL COMMENT ON VETERAN ’S ARTICLE: “THE NATIONAL QUESTION AND THE LETTISH PROLETARIAT ” We gladly publish Comrade Veteran’s78 article, which gives an outline of the history of the national questionamong the Letts in general and in the Lettish Social-Demo-cratic Party in particular. 
 Draft amendments or addenda by Lettish Marxists for the decision by the Summer (1913) Confer-ence 79 would be very welcome. 
 Lettish Social-Democrats have long been in sympathy with the Bund; but this sympathywas shaken firstly by the theoretical criticism of the Marx-ists, and secondly by the Bundists’ separatism in practice,particularly after 1906. 
 We hope that the discussion of the national question among Lettish Social-Democrats will con-tinue and that it will lead to the adoption of definite deci-sions. 
 As regards Comrade Veteran’s remarks, we have only the following comment to make. 
 He thinks our reference toSwitzerland * unconvincing because all three nations in that country are historical and have been equal from the very beginning. 
 But “nations without a history” cannotfind models or patterns anywhere (apart from utopias) ex-cept among historical nations. 
 As for the equality of na-tions, that is something even advocates of “cultural-nationalautonomy” take for granted. 
 Consequently, the experi-ence of civilised mankind tells us that where genuine equality of nations and consistent democracy exist, “cultur-al-national autonomy” is superfluous; and where they donot exist, it remains utopian, and propaganda in its favour is propaganda in favour of refined nationalism.

 PREFACE TO THE SYMPOSIUM: IS M AND LIQUIDATIONIS M 80 The symposium herewith presented to the reader consists of articles written between 1909 and 1914. 
 This was a period in which the working-class movement in Russia encountered particularly serious difficulties. 
 Marxists, however, were not and could not be content with simply pointing to thedifficulties, with simply complaining about the generaldisintegration, break-down, and so forth. 
 It was necessaryto determine the economic and political causes of thebreak-down from the point of view of the particular stage of Russia’s capitalist development, and determine the class significance of the broadest trend that reflected this break-down, namely, the trend of liquidationism . 
 The basic answer to this question, which is extremely important to the working-class movement, was given by theMarxists in December 1908 in the form of very precise, ful-ly formulated and official decisions. 
 81 These decisions had to be clarified, disseminated and applied to the everyday problems of the economic and political movement. 
 This wasdone in the articles we have collected in the present sympo-sium, which, for reasons “beyond the editors’ control” isunfortunately far from complete. 
 At present, after a Marxist daily press has been in exist-ence in St. 
 Petersburg for nearly two years, the entire ques-tion of the significance and appraisal of liquidationism, notonly in theory, but also in practice, has been submitted — if one may so express it—to the decision of the workers them-selves. 
 This is tremendously fortunate for the working-class movement of Russia, and a great sign of its maturity. 
 The class-conscious workers are themselves seeking the truthand they will find it; they will determine the class signifi-cance of liquidationism, employ the practical experience of their mass movement to verify its appraisal, and devise ex-pedient methods to combat it. 
 Our object in publishing the present symposium is to come to the aid of all workers interested in the fate of themovement of their class. 
 The articles are given here, not intheir chronological order, but according to subjects , in the order (approximately) of their transition from theory to practice. 
 First come the fundamental questions (Section 1) a so-lution for which must be found if we are to have anythinglike intelligent tactics and an intelligent policy. 
 Here thereader will find an appraisal of the present historical situa-tion and of the class significance of the struggle of the Marx-ist trends. 
 The next question dealt with is that of the hegemony of the proletariat in connection with the criticismof the liquidator’s principal “work” ( The Social Movement ): And lastly, come articles on the question of the bourgeoi-sie’s “swing to the left”. 
 Then come (Section 2) articles on the election campaign, on the results of the Fourth Duma elections, and on Duma tactics. 
 After that comes (Section 3) the question of the “open party”, and the question of unity, which is inseparably con-nected with it. 
 Section 4 deals with liberal-labour politics in its various applications. 
 After a general appraisal of reformism comes an examination of the questions of “partial demands”, freedomof association, the strike movement, the attitude of theliquidators towards the liberals and vice versa. 
 The last subject (Section 5) is the liquidators and the working-class movement. 
 Here the reader will find an ap-praisal of the working-class movement in the years 1905-07 given by Koltsov, one of the leaders of liquidationism, inhis principal work; an examination of the workers’ attitudetowards the liquidators in practice; and the most up-to-datematerial on the history of the formation of the RussianSocial-Democratic Labour group in the Duma. 
 In the “conclusion” an attempt is made to review the struggle of trends in the present-day working-class move-ment. 
 We permit ourselves the hope that our symposium will help the workers to find and study the data on the contro-versial issues. 
 Naturally, we have been unable to include a good deal of important material. 
 On the other hand, in asymposium of articles by different authors written over aseries of years repetition is inevitable. 
 There are, of course,individual shades among the authors. 
 But, taken together,all their articles are no more than a commentary, an ap-plication of formulated Marxist decisions, whose recogni-tion, among other things, distinguishes the class-consciousorganised Marxist workers from the liquidators of the work-ers’ party, and from those who are dropping away from theParty. 
 One of our main objects is to clarify and test thesedecisions, and to make it easier to formulate such amend-ments and addenda to them as may become necessary in the course of time.

 Priboi Publishers St. 
 Petersburg POLITICAL DISPUTES AMONG THE LIBERALS Put Pravdy (No. 
 18) of last Friday published an article entitled “Mr. 
 Struve on the Need to ‘Reform the Gov-ernment’” * in which we informed our readers of the ap-praisal of the political situation in Russia given by one of the most outspoken and consistent of the counter-revolution-ary liberals. 
 The next day Rech published a tremendously long “doctri-nal” article by Mr. 
 Milyukov “against” Mr. 
 Struve in connec-tion with this very article on the need to reform the govern-ment. 
 It will be useful to dwell on this dispute between the two liberals, firstly, because vital issues of Russian poli-tics are involved, and secondly, because it reveals the two political types of leading bourgeois. 
 And they are types that will have important political significance in Russiafor a long time to come, for decades, types that are of simi-lar significance in all capitalist countries. 
 In its own inter-ests, the proletariat must know these types. 
 During the past few years Mr. 
 Struve has set forth his views most fully and clearly in the book Vekhi . 
 82 These are the views of a counter-revolutionary liberal, an adher-ent of religion (and of philosophical idealism as the truestand most “scholarly” road to it), and an opponent of democra-cy. 
 They are the clear, distinctly expressed views, not of an individual, but of a class, for as a matter of fact the entire mass of the Octobrist and Cadet bourgeoisie in Russia during 1907-14 subscribed to them. 
 The crux of the matter is that the Octobrist and Cadet bourgeoisie have swung to the right, away from democracy. 
 The crux of the matter is that this bourgeoisie is more afraid *See pp. 
 114-16 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 of the people than of reaction. 
 The crux of the matter is that this rightward swing has not been accidental, but has been caused by the class struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. 
 The crux of the matter is that Struve and thenMaklakov have told the truth about their class and theirparty more frankly than other Cadets have. 
 And this home truth has been very unpalatable to the dip-lomats of the Cadet Party (headed by Mr. 
 Milyukov), who deem it necessary to flirt with democracy in the belief that the role of this democracy is not quite played out, and thatthe bourgeoisie may perhaps have to live and act in a milieucreated, not only by the Purishkeviches but—God forbid—by the democracy, by the “mob”, by the “street”, by theworkers. 
 While taking the same line as Mr. 
 Struve and Mr. 
 Makla-kov, Mr. 
 Milyukov tries to cover it up, show himself offbefore the public, fool democracy and keep it in leadingstrings. 
 That is why Mr. 
 Milyukov pretends that he disagrees with Vekhi , that he disagrees with Struve, and that he is refuting Maklakov, when as a matter of fact he is merely teaching Struve and Maklakov how to conceal their thoughts more cunningly. 
 The gist of Mr. 
 Milyukov’s long article against Struve is his accusation that Struve is “hopelessly muddled”. 
 Hot and strong, is it not?Where is the muddle? It is in Struve’s holding the “op-timistic” belief that the government can be reformed, while at the same time saying that it is learning no lessons fromthe “upheavals” and is making them inevitable. 
 The wayout, according to Mr. 
 Struve, is either “unrest”, or the reformof government. 
 As for the first way out, Mr. 
 Struve doesnot want to “effectively work” for it or even “wish” it. 
 Mr. 
 Struve is indeed muddled, but then so is Mr. 
 Milyu-kov—completely, absolutely muddled, for neither can the Constitutional-Democratic Party—of which Milyukov is theleader—“wish” the first way out or “effectively work”for it. 
 This is proved, not by words (those who in politics judge men and parties by their words are foolish), but by their deeds , i. 
e. 
, by the entire history of the Constitutional-Dem-ocratic Party from 1905 to 1914, for almost a decade. 
 The Constitutional-Democratic Party is more afraid of siding with the workers (on questions of the minimum programme, of course) than of being dependent on the Purishkeviches. 
 This applies to the entire party, to the entire Cadet and Octobrist bourgeoisie. 
 And Milyukov simply makes himselfridiculous when he tries to lay the blame for this on Struvealone. 
 In all countries the experience of history shows that a bourgeoisie which desires progress vacillates between sidingwith the workers and being dependent on the Purishkeviches. 
In all countries—and the more civilised and free the coun-try, the more marked this is—we see two types of bour-geois politicians. 
 One type openly leans towards religion, towards the Purishkeviches, towards a forthright struggle against democracy, and tries to build up consistent theoreti-cal evidence to support this tendency. 
 The other type spe-cialises in covering up this very same tendency by flirting with democracy. 
 There are diplomatic Milyukovs everywhere, and the workers must learn to detect the cloven hoof at once. 
 Put Pravdy No. 
 25, Published according to March 1, 1914 the text in Put Pravdy THE “LABOURING ” PEASANTRY AND THE TRADE IN LAND The Left-Narodnik talk about the “labouring” peasantry is such a scandalous imposture and corruption of the social-ist consciousness of the workers that it is necessary to exam-ine it again and again. 
 The more our Left Narodniks flaunt their platitudes and saccharine speeches, the more important it becomes tocounter them with precise data on peasant economy. 
 There is nothing the Left Narodnik fights shy of so much as precise data on the peasant bourgeoisie and the peasant proletariat. 
 Let us take the returns of the last Zemstvo statistical survey of the peasants in the vicinity of Moscow. 
 83 Here agriculture has taken on a relatively very pronounced com-mercial character due to the considerable development offruit and vegetable farming. 
 And this example of a district that is more developed as regards the domination of the mar-ket reveals all the more strikingly the essential features of all peasant economy under capitalism. 
 The first district of Moscow suburban peasant economy (we take only this one district because, unfortunately, thestatistics do not give us general summaries) covers over two thousand peasant farms. 
 The number is sufficiently large to enable us to study the typical relations between the proletar-iat and the bourgeoisie among the “labouring” peasantry. 
 It is noteworthy that capitalist agriculture here is devel-oping on ordinary land with farms of extremely small size,2,336 peasant farms having a total of 4,253 dessiatines of allotment land, i. 
e. 
, an average of less than two dessiatines per farm. 
 If we add 1,761 dessiatines of leased land andsubtract 625 dessiatines of land rented out, we get a total of 5,389 dessiatines, i. 
e. 
, an average of less than two dessia-tines per farm. 
 Nevertheless, two-thirds of the peasants em-ploy hired labour! The higher the level of agricultural techniques, the more intensive the farming, and the stronger the influence of themarket, the more often do we meet with large-scale produc-tion on small plots of land. 
 This is constantly overlooked by bourgeois professors and our Left Narodniks, who are so enthusiastic about small farms (reckoned in area of land), and gloss over the capitalist nature of modern small farms that employ hired labour. 
 Let us examine the trade that is going on in allotment land. 
 The figures for leased and rented out land show thatthis trade is very considerable. 
 About half the leased land is allotment land. 
 Altogether, 625 dessiatines of allotment land is rented out, and 845 dessiatines are leased. 
 Clearly,the old system of allotment land tenure, which by its verynature is identified with serfdom and medievalism, is be-coming an obstacle to modern trade and capitalist circulation. 
 Capitalism is breaking down the old system of allotment tenure. 
 Farming is not adapting itself to the official allotment, but is demanding the free sale and purchase of land, free renting and leasing in conformity with the demands of themarket, the requirements of the bourgeois economic system. 
 Take the peasant proletariat. 
 Under this category, first of all, come 405 households (out of the 2,336) which are eith-er landless or have up to half a dessiatine of land. 
 These 405 households own 437 dessiatines of allotment land. 
 Butthese are poor, largely horseless, peasants, who do nothave the wherewithal to engage in farming. 
 They rent out372 dessiatines—the greater part of their land—and arethemselves becoming wage-workers. 
 Of the 405 households, 376 “provide” agricultural labourers, or industrial workers who have given up farming. 
 Take the richest peasant bourgeoisie. 
 Here 526 households have farms of over three dessiatines. 
 This already is capital-ist farming, with fruit and vegetable growing. 
 Of these526 farmers 509 employ labourers. 
 The working members of the families number 1,706, and they employ 1,248 labour-ers (by the year or season), exclusive of day-labourers (51,000working days). 
 These households own a total of 1,540 dessiatines, an average of less than three dessiatines of allotment land per household. 
 But they rent out only 42 and lease 1,102 dessia-tines, of which 512 dessiatines is allotment land! By “con-centrating” land in this way, these “labouring” peasants,having an average of three working members of the family per farm, are becoming typical bourgeois with an averageof two and a half hired labourers per farm and nearly a hun-dred hired day-labourer working days. 
 The buying and sell-ing of the produce of land leads to the development of the buying and selling of land itself (leasing and renting out), and to the buying and selling of labour-power . 
 Now consider the Left Narodniks’ assertion that the abolition of private ownership of the land means “withdraw-ing the land” from commercial circulation! This is a purely philistine fairy-tale. 
 In fact, the very opposite is the case;this abolition would draw the land into commercial circula-tion on a vaster scale than ever before. 
 The capital now being spent on the purchase of land would be released, thefeudal and bureaucratic obstacles to the free transfer of land from one person to another would disappear, and capitalism, i. 
e. 
, the renting out of land by the proletariat and the“concentration” of land by the bourgeoisie, would developstill more rapidly. 
 This measure, which is useful as a means of fighting the feudal landlords, the Left Narodniks try to pass off as “so-cialism”, though actually it is only a bourgeois measure. 
 It is undeniable that the peasant proletarians and the peas-ant bourgeoisie have common interests against the landlords. 
 Every Marxist working man knows that, but to obscure con-sciousness of the class antagonisms between the proletariatand the bourgeoisie by jabber about the “labouring” peasan-try means deserting to the bourgeoisie, deserting to the ene-mies of socialism. 
 Moscow suburban farming shows us, as if under a magni-fying glass, what is going on everywhere in Russia in a mild-er and less definable form. 
 Everywhere the peasant who doesnot hire himself out or does not himself employ hired la-bour is already becoming the exception. 
 Every day, even in the remoter districts, we find trade developing, and the gulfbetween the proletarians (hired workers) and the small pro-prietors, the petty bourgeoisie, the peasants, widening more and more. 
 It is the aim of the urban proletariat to develop a clear realisation of this class antagonism, which, in the ruraldistricts, is obscured by the specific features of agriculture and the survivals of serfdom. 
 It is the aim of the bourgeoisie,in whose footsteps the petty-bourgeois Left Narodniks arefoolishly following, to hinder the realisation of this class antagonism by means of empty, meaningless and utterly false phrases about the “labouring” peasantry.

 WHAT IS WORRYING THE LIBERALS In connection with V. 
 Maklakov’s Duma speeches and his press statements in favour of the “new” plan for combiningthe tactics of the Cadets and Octobrists, there has of latebeen a good deal of talk about the revival of liberalism. 
 The Zemstvo banquet in Moscow has lent colour to these ru-mours. 
 It is noteworthy that particular emphasis has been laid on the fact that even V. 
 Maklakov, that most moderate of liber-als, with a leaning towards Octobrism, has lost “faith in thepossibility of a way being found out of the impasse without revolutionary upheavals and cataclysms”. 
 This, literally, is what is written in Rech , the chief organ of the liberals, by Mr. 
 Shingaryov who, together with Mr. 
 Milyukov, pre-tends to criticise the “Right” Cadets, V. 
 Maklakov and P. 
 Struve, “ from the left ”. 
 But the disputes among the Cadets have been most trifl-ing. 
 They have been arguing whether the proposal made to the Octobrists about joining the opposition is new or not,and whether that proposal, which has been made a hundredtimes and never led to anything, is worth repeating for thehundred and first time. 
 Behind these absolutely meaninglessdisputes one can discern the liberals’ chief and common cause of worry , which hinders the cause of Russia’s libera-tion only slightly less than the Octobrists’ vacillations. 
 Yougentlemen of the liberal fold, who are arguing all the timewith the Octobrists and about the Octobrists, should takea good look at yourselves! Take the small political encyclopaedia issued by Rech and entitled The Year-Book for 1914. 
 Among its contributors are the most prominent and most responsible Cadets, theacknowledged leaders of the party, headed by Milyukov and Shingaryov. 
 In the survey of “Our Public Life” (by Mr. 
 Iz-goyev), we read the following appraisal of the fundamental issues in Russian home policies: “By its excessive zeal the Administration is only weakening the anti-revolutionary forces within the community. 
” Don’t you think it absurd, Messrs. 
 the Cadets, to hurl thunderbolts at the Octobrists, when the most genuine Oc-tobrism is preached in your own publications? A result of the Administration’s “hopeless and misguided” struggle against educational institutions, writes Mr. 
 Iz-goyev, is: “a corruption of life, leading to the weakening of the purely pub-lic [!] activity, which produces the spiritual antidotes to ideas thatare really a menace to the country”. 
 Now this is a tone worthy, not only of an Octobrist, but even of a prosecutor, a Shcheglovitov. 
84 And as if to illustrate what these “ideas that are a menace to the coun-try” are, our liberal says: “One can understand [from the point of view of the corruption of life by the misguided Administration] why at workers’ meetingsand in the trade unions the Bolsheviks gain the upper hand over themore level-headed and cultured leaders [!?] of the working-class movement. 
” This political appraisal of the liquidators is uttered and reiterated by the liberals times without number. 
 As amatter of fact, we have here nothing more nor less than a po-litical alliance between the liberals and the liquidators. 
In turning their backs on the “underground” and advocating a legal party the liquidators are doing in the ranks of the workers exactly what the liberals want them to do. 
 Put Pravdy No. 
 29, Published according to March 6, 1914 the text in Put Pravdy NARODNIKS AND LIQUIDATORS IN THE TRADE UNION MOVEMENT (A VALUABLE ADMISSION) In recent issues of the Left-Narodnik newspaper, we find, side by side with complaints about our (the Pravdists’)“factionalism”, valuable admissions by several Narodniks about their views on important issue of the trade union movement coinciding with those of the liquidators. 
 We havealways said it, but it is pleasant indeed to hear this confes-sion from our opponents ’ lips. 
 “On this question we differ sharply from the Bolsheviks, who regard the union as their special preserve [!]... The Mensheviks’ view [for some reason the Narodniks say “Men-sheviks” instead of “liquidators”] of the union as an extra-factional organisation is identical with ours [the Narod-niks’]. 
 This, perhaps, accounts for our good relations withthe Mensheviks in past activities. 
” This was written inVernaya Mysl No. 
 6. 
 “The line of conduct taken by the executives of those un-ions in which the Left Narodniks have been in control all thetime in noway differs from the line of conduct of the so-called liquidationist unions,” the same Left-Narodnik news-paper added. 
 An extraordinarily frank and valuable admission! On their own showing, it appears that our “frightfully Left” Narodniks behave in the trade union movement exactly like the liquidators. 
 Hence, the blocs (alliances, agreements) between the liquidators and the Narodniks against the Marxists, which have been repeatedly mentioned in our press. 
 The Narodnik Stoikaya Mysl85 even frankly defends these blocs between the Left Narodniks and the liquidators against the Marxists. 
 “During the present period of Pravdist preponderance in the trade union organisations ... there is nothing terrible or strange in temporary agreements between the Narodniks and the Luchists, ” writes Stoikaya Mysl No. 
 2. 
 * The liquidators are not so candid. 
 They know that “such things” are done, but not spoken of. 
 To call oneself a Social-Democrat while at the same time allying with an alienparty against the Social-Democrats is “tactics” that can be pursued only underhandedly. 
 But this does not change anything. 
 The alliance between the liquidators and the Narodniks in the trade union move-ment (and in the educational societies) is a fact. 
 And in the present state of affairs it is inevitable. 
 The liquidators andthe Narodniks are united by their common hostility towards consistent Marxism, in all spheres of activity. 
 In trade union activity they are united in both being representativesof the “neutralism of weakness ”, “willy-nilly neutralism”. 
 Neither the liquidators nor the Narodniks have any realinfluence in the trade union movement. 
 Although a feebleminority, they demand “equality” with the Marxists. 
 This demand is “theoretically” defensible only from the neutral-ist point of view. 
 Hence the “neutralism ” of all groups with little influence in the working-class movement. 
 The Narodniks say that they are uniting with the liquida-tors “ solely for the purpose of protecting the non-factionalism of the workers ’ organisations against the extravagant claims of the Pravdists ” ( Stoikaya Mysl Nos. 
 2 and 4). 
 What are these “claims” of the Pravdists? Have they shut the door of any union or society to workers who hold polit-ical views different from their own? Have they stuckany “label” on any of the unions? Have they split any organ-isation? They have done nothing of the kind! Our opponents have not quoted a single fact of this kind, nor can they do *Mr. 
 Boris Voronov, the author of the article, his eyes big with surprise, quotes as an example of incredible “factionalism” the factthat at the meetings of the executive of one of the unions “they dis-cussed the question of assisting the Pravdist press, and technical editorial questions (how to improve the correspondence department,etc. 
)”. 
 Oh, horror! What a crime it is to assist a newspaper, whichunites nine-tenths of the advanced workers, with correspondence andthe like! How, after this, can the Narodniks help throwing themselvesinto the arms of the liquidators?... so. 
 By the “extravagant claims” of the Pravdists they mean that the Pravdists do not want to associate themselves with the petty-bourgeois policy of the Narodniks and liquidators, and, while loyally submitting to the majority of the workerswithin a single union , they fight for influence for their Marxist ideas. 
 We have never been guilty of the sins ascribed to us. 
 It is the Narodniks and the liquidators who are guilty of them. 
 Here are the facts. 
 Several years ago the Narodniks obtained a majority in the Railwaymen’s Union. 
 This hap-pened because they had the backing, not of the workers, butof the railway clerks, and because of other fortuitous cir-cumstances. 
 What did the Narodniks do? They immediately“stuck a label” on that union, compelled it to adopt its own special “platform”, ousted the Social-Democrats and non-Party workers, and compelled them to form a parallel unionof their own. 
 Now that was a really “extravagant claim”. 
 They hastened to make good their first chance victory by affixing a label. 
The fact that the Narodniks do not do this in other unions is not because they are so virtuous, but because their influ-ence everywhere among the workers is very slight . 
 The same thing applies to the liquidators. 
 When they controlled the Metalworkers’ Union they turned it into abranch of the liquidators’ organisation. 
 The organ of theunion published provocative articles against the “under-ground” (see Nash Put No. 
 20, p. 
 2, Metallist No. 
 3, etc. 
 86), although no general meeting of the members ever expressedapproval of the liquidator line. 
 Such are the actual facts. 
 By the “extravagant claims” of the Pravdists they mean that the Pravdists try to get theworkers to settle their affairs themselves by a majority vote. 
 If at a general meeting of metalworkers 3,000 vote for the Pravdists and a hundred or two vote for the liquidators andthe Narodniks combined, then, in the name of so-called “non-factionalism” we are supposed to admit that 3,000 is equalto 200! This is what liquidator-Narodnik “non-factionalism”means. 
 We do not defend neutralism; we are opposed to it. 
 But we do not behave like the Narodniks and liquidators whenthey obtain a chance majority in some union. 
 Only feeble groups with no principles lose their heads at the first “vic-tory” and hasten to “consolidate” their victory by a major-ity of a score or so of votes. 
 Excited and in a hurry not to miss such a golden opportunity, they hastily revise their“principles”, forget their neutralism, and stick on a label. 
Marxists do not behave like that. 
 They are not stray visi-tors in the working-class movement. 
 They know that sooneror later all the unions will take their stand on the basis of Marxism. 
 They are convinced that the future belongs to their ideas and, therefore, they do not force events, do not goadthe unions on, and do not stick labels on them or split them. 
 Steadily and confidently they carry on their Marxist prop-aganda. 
 They patiently teach Marxism to the workers,drawing on the lessons of life, and no deals between unprin-cipled groups will divert them from that path. 
 There was a time when the present-day liquidators demand-ed that the trade unions should be Party unions and haveofficial representation in the Party. 
 There was a time whenthe Narodniks compelled the Railwaymen’s Union to official-ly swear allegiance to their programme. 
 Today both have swung to the opposite extreme, and stand for neutralism. 
 They have been compelled to do this by the political weak-ness of their positions. 
 We are following our old road, proclaimed long ago and upheld by the entire body of Marxists. 
 The liquidators havea full right to enter into an alliance with the Narodniks. 
 But it is an alliance based on abandonment of principles and on weakness. 
 The road which the liquidator-Narodnikbloc proposes to the unions is not the road of the advancedworkers. 
 Put Pravdy No. 
 30, Published according to March 7, 1914 the text in Put Pravdy PIOUS WISHES The liberal newspapers recently published or favourably reported K. 
 Arsenyev’s appeal for greater attention to bepaid to the collection of information on summary exile. 
 “Although numerous cases of arbitrary and lawless acts on the part of the Administration are reported in the newspapers,” wrote K. 
 Arsenyev, “others, no less numerous and outrageous, pass unnoticed and unobserved. 
 This omission could be rectified to a considerableextent if some sort of system were introduced in the collection of in-formation on the subject. 
 The reasons for summary exile and arrest, which are being widely practised to this day, especially among theworkers, become known only by chance and, therefore, in a fragmen-tary way. 
 Similarly, news about the condition of the exiles in their places of exile finds its way into the press only by accident. 
” What is true is true! The liberal parties, the liberal members of the Duma, the liberal lawyers, the liberal jour-nalists, various groups of liberals, and so forth, could veryeasily collect and publish legally and illegally, very full and systematic material on every one of those cases which “are being widely practised, especially among the work-ers”. 
 Rech , for example, “heartily welcomed the advice and the appeals coming from that highly respected public figure”K. 
 Arsenyev. 
 Then why don’t you go ahead, gentlemen? Surely you, of all people, have every opportunity and means of organis-ing the proper collection and publication of informationabout this “everyday feature” of Russian life, which you allprotest against and condemn, and about which you are al-ways talking! But see, not a single liberal newspaper, which is a thousand times better “provided for” (in all respects) against all kinds of obstacles and barriers, collects preciseinformation about all cases of exile and arrest. 
 We are obliged to say that our liberals are past masters in the art of expressing good and pious wishes, but when it comes to publishing the names of all those who have been exiled or to publishing information about them and syste-matic reports of how they are faring, in Arsenyev’s ownVestnik Yevropy , or in Russkiye Vedomosti , 87 or in Rech , then nothing is done. 
 Evidently, it is much easier (and safer) to “support” ap-peals in word than to do something in response to those appeals.... 
 Put Pravdy No. 
 32, Published according to March 9, 1914 the text in Put Pravdy A LIBERAL PROFESSOR ON EQUALITY Liberal Professor Mr. 
 Tugan-Baranovsky is on the war-path against socialism. 
 This time he has approached the question, not from the political and economic angle, but from that of an abstract discussion on equality (perhaps theprofessor thought such an abstract discussion more suitablefor the religious and philosophical gatherings which he hasaddressed?). 
 “If we take socialism, not as an economic theory, but as a living ideal,” Mr. 
 Tugan declared, “then, undoubtedly, it is associated withthe ideal of equality, but equality is a concept ... that cannot be de-duced from experience and reason. 
” This is the reasoning of a liberal scholar who repeats the incredibly trite and threadbare argument that experience and reason clearly prove that men are not equal, yet social-ism bases its ideal on equality. 
 Hence, socialism, if youplease, is an absurdity which is contrary to experience andreason, and so forth! Mr. 
 Tugan repeats the old trick of the reactionaries: first to misinterpret socialism by making it out to be an absurdity, and then to triumphantly refute the absurdity! When we say that experience and reason prove that men arenot equal, we mean by equality, equality in abilities or simi-larity in physical strength and mental ability. 
 It goes without saying that in this respect men are not equal. 
 No sensible person and no socialist forgets this. 
 But this kind of equality has nothing whatever to do with social-ism. 
 If Mr. 
 Tugan is quite unable to think , he is at least able to read; were he to take the well-known work of one of the founders of scientific socialism, Frederick Engels, directed against Dühring, he would find there a special section ex-plaining the absurdity of imagining that economic equality means anything else than the abolition of classes . 
 But when professors set out to refute socialism, one never knowswhat to wonder at most—their stupidity, their ignorance,or their unscrupulousness. 
 Since we have Mr. 
 Tugan to deal with, we shall have to start with the rudiments. 
 By political equality Social-Democrats mean equal rights , and by economic equality, as we have already said, theymean the abolition of classes . 
 As for establishing human equality in the sense of equality of strength and abilities(physical and mental), socialists do not even think of such things. 
 Political equality is a demand for equal political rights for all citizens of a country who have reached a certain age and who do not suffer from either ordinary or liberal-pro-fessorial feeble-mindedness. 
 This demand was first advanced,not by the socialists, not by the proletariat, but by the bourgeoisie . 
 The well-known historical experience of all countries of the world proves this, and Mr. 
 Tugan couldeasily have discovered this had he not called “experience”to witness solely in order to dupe students and work-ers, and please the powers that be by “abolishing” social-ism. 
 The bourgeoisie put forward the demand for equal rights for all citizens in the struggle against medieval, feudal, serf-owner and caste privileges. 
 In Russia, for example, unlikeAmerica, Switzerland and other countries, the privileges ofthe nobility are preserved to this day in all spheres of polit-ical life, in elections to the Council of State, in elections to the Duma, in municipal administration, in taxation, and many other things. 
 Even the most dull-witted and ignorant person can grasp the fact that individual members of the nobility are not equal in physical and mental abilities any more than arepeople belonging to the “tax-paying”, “base”, “low-born” or “non-privileged” peasant class. 
 But in rights , all nobles are equal , just as all the peasants are equal in their lack of rights. 
 Does our learned liberal Professor Tugan now under-stand the difference between equality in the sense of equal rights, and equality in the sense of equal strength and abilities? We shall now deal with economic equality, In the United States of America, as in other advanced countries, there areno medieval privileges. 
 All citizens are equal in politicalrights. 
 But are they equal as regards their position in social production ? No, Mr. 
 Tugan, they are not. 
 Some own land, factories and capital and live on the unpaid labour of the workers; theseform an insignificant minority. 
 Others, namely, the vastmass of the population, own no means of production andlive only by selling their labour-power; these are prole-tarians. 
 In the United States of America there is no aristocracy, and the bourgeoisie and the proletariat enjoy equal political rights. 
 But they are not equal in class status: one class, the capitalists, own the means of production and live on theunpaid labour of the workers. 
 The other class, the wage-workers, the proletariat, own no means of production and live by selling their labour-power in the market. 
 The abolition of classes means placing all citizens on an equal footing with regard to the means of production belong-ing to society as a whole. 
 It means giving all citizens equal opportunities of working on the publicly-owned means of production, on the publicly-owned land, at the publicly-owned factories, and so forth. 
 This explanation of socialism has been necessary to enlighten our learned liberal professor, Mr. 
 Tugan, whomay, if he tries hard, now grasp the fact that it isabsurd to expect equality of strength and abilities in social-ist society. 
 In brief, when socialists speak of equality they always mean social equality, equality of social status, and not by any means the physical and mental equality of individ-uals. 
 The puzzled reader may ask: how could a learned liberal professor have forgotten these elementary axioms familiar to anybody who has read any exposition of the views ofsocialism? The answer is simple: the personal qualities of present-day professors are such that we may find among them even exceptionally stupid people like Tugan. 
 But the social status of professors in bourgeois society is such that only those are allowed to hold such posts who sell scienceto serve the interests of capital, and agree to utter themost fatuous nonsense, the most unscrupulous drivel andtwaddle against the socialists. 
 The bourgeoisie will forgivethe professors all this as long as they go on “abolishing” socialism.

 33, Published according to March 11, 1914 the text in Put Pravdy THE BRITISH LIBERALS AND IRELAND What is taking place today in the British Parliament in connection with the Bill on Irish Home Rule is of exception-al interest as far as class relationships and elucidation ofthe national and the agrarian problems are concerned. 
 For centuries England has enslaved Ireland, condemned the Irish peasants to unparalleled misery and gradualextinction from starvation, driven them off the land andcompelled hundreds of thousands and even millions of themto leave their native country and emigrate to America. 
 Atthe beginning of the nineteenth century, Ireland had a pop-ulation of five and a half millions; today the population is only four and one-third millions. 
 Ireland has becomedepopulated. 
 Over five million Irish emigrated to Americain the course of the nineteenth century, so that there arenow more Irish in the United States than there are in Ire-land! The appalling destitution and sufferings of the Irish peas-antry are an instructive example of the lengths to which thelandowners and the liberal bourgeoisie of a “dominant”nation will go. 
 Britain owes her “brilliant” economic devel-opment and the “prosperity” of her industry and commercelargely to her treatment of the Irish peasantry, which recalls the misdeeds of the Russian serf-owner Saltychikha. 
 88 While Britain “flourished”, Ireland moved towards extinc-tion and remained an undeveloped, semi-barbarous, purelyagrarian country, a land of poverty-stricken tenant farmers. 
But much as the “enlightened and liberal” British bourgeoi-sie desired to perpetuate Ireland’s enslavement and poverty, reform inevitably approached, the more so that the revolu-tionary eruptions of the Irish people’s fight for liberty andland became more and more ominous. 
 The year 1861 saw the formation of the Irish revolutionary organisation of Fenians . 
 Irish settlers in America gave it every assist-ance. 
 With the formation, in 1868, of the government of Glad-stone—that hero of the liberal bourgeoisie and obtusephilistines—the era of reform in Ireland set in, an era which has dragged on very nicely till the present day, i. 
e. 
, justunder half a century. 
 Oh, the wise statesmen of the liberal bourgeoisie are very well able to “make haste slowly” in the matter of reform! Karl Marx, who had been living in London for over fifteen years, followed the struggle of the Irish with great interestand sympathy. 
 He wrote to Frederick Engels on November 2,1867: “I have done my best to bring about this demonstra-tion of the English workers in favour of Fenianism .... 
 I used to think the separation of Ireland from England impossible. 
I now think it inevitable, although after the separationthere may come federation .... 
” Reverting to the same subject in a letter dated November 30th of the same year, Marxwrote: “The question now is, what shall we advise the English workers? In my opinion they must make the repeal of the Union [the abolition of the union with Ireland] (in short,the affair of 1783, only democratised and adapted to the con-ditions of the time) an article of their pronunziamento . 
 This is the only legal and therefore only possible form ofIrish emancipation which can be admitted in the programme of an English [workers’] party. 
” 89 And Marx went on to show that what the Irish needed was Home Rule and independ-ence of Britain, an agrarian revolution and tariffs againstBritain. 
 Such was the programme proposed to the British workers by Marx, in the interests of Irish freedom, of accelerating the social development and freedom of the British workers; because the British workers could not become free so longas they helped to keep another nation in slavery (or even al-lowed it) Alas! Owing to a number of special historical causes, the British workers of the last third of the nineteenth century proved dependent upon the Liberals, impregnated with the spirit of liberal-labour policy. 
 They proved to be, notat the head of nations and classes fighting for liberty, but in the wake of the contemptible lackeys of the money-bags, the British Liberals. 
 And the Liberals have for half a century been dragging out Ireland’s liberation, which has not been completed tothis day! It was not until the twentieth century that theIrish peasant began to turn from a tenant farmer into a free-holder, but the Liberals have imposed upon him a system ofland purchase at a “fair” price ! He has paid, and will contin-ue to pay for many years, millions upon millions to the British landlords as a reward for their having robbed him forcenturies and reduced him to a state of chronic starvation. 
The British liberal bourgeois has made the Irish peasantthank the landlord for this in hard cash .... 
 A Home Rule Bill for Ireland is now going through Par-liament. 
 But in Ireland there is the Northern province of Ulster, which is inhabited partly by English-born Protestantsas distinct from the Catholic Irish. 
 Well then, the BritishConservatives, led by Carson, the British version of ourBlack-Hundred landlord Purishkevich, have raised a fright-ful outcry against Irish Home Rule. 
 This, they say, means subjecting Ulstermen to an alien people of alien creed! Lord Carson has threatened rebellion, and has organisedgangs of reactionary armed thugs for this purpose. 
 An empty threat, of course. 
 There can be no question of a rebellion by a handful of hoodlums. 
 Nor could therebe any question of an Irish Parliament (whose powers are determined by British law) “oppressing” the Protestants. 
 It is simply a question of the reactionary landlords trying to scare the Liberals. 
 And the Liberals are losing their nerve, bowing to the reactionaries, making concessions to them, offering to con-duct a referendum in Ulster and put off reform for Ulster for six years! The haggling between the Liberals and the reactionariescontinues. 
 Reform can wait: the Irish have waited half acentury; they can wait a little longer; you can’t very well“offend ” the landlords! Of course, if the Liberals appealed to the people of Brit-ain, to the proletariat, Carson’s reactionary gangs would melt away immediately and disappear. 
 The peaceful andfull achievement of freedom by Ireland would be guaranteed, But is it conceivable that the liberal bourgeois will turn to the proletariat for aid against the landlords? Why, the Liberals in Britain are also lackeys of the money-bags, capable only of cringing to the Carsons. 
 Put Pravdy No. 
 34, Published according to March 12, 1914 the text in Put Pravdy THE TAYLOR SYSTEM —MAN ’S ENSLAVEMENT BY THE MACHINE Capitalism cannot be at a standstill for a single moment. 
 It must forever be moving forward. 
 Competition, whichis keenest in a period of crisis like the present, calls for the invention of an increasing number of new devices to reduce the cost of production. 
 But the domination of capital convertsall these devices into instruments for the further exploitationof the workers. 
 The Taylor system is one of these devices. 
Advocates of this system recently used the following tech-niques in America. 
 An electric lamp was attached to a worker’s arm, the worker’s movements were photographed and the movementsof the lamp studied. 
 Certain movements were found to be“superfluous” and the worker was made to avoid them, i. 
e. 
,to work more intensively, without losing a second for rest. 
 The layout of new factory buildings is planned in such a way that not a moment will be lost in delivering materialsto the factory, in conveying them from one shop to another,and in dispatching the finished products. 
 The cinema issystematically employed for studying the work of the best operatives and increasing its intensity, i. 
e. 
, “speeding up” the workers. 
 For example, a mechanic’s operations were filmed in the course of a whole day. 
 After studying the mechanic’s move-ments the efficiency experts provided him with a bench highenough to enable him to avoid losing time in bending down. 
 He was given a boy to assist him. 
 This boy had to hand up each part of the machine in a definite and most efficient way. 
Within a few days the mechanic performed the work of /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR assembling the given type of machine in one-fourth of the time it had taken before! What an enormous gain in labour productivity!... But the worker’s pay is not increased fourfold, but only half asmuch again, at the very most, and only for a short period at that. 
 As soon as the workers get used to the new systemtheir pay is cut to the former level. 
 The capitalist obtainsan enormous profit, but the workers toil four times as hard as before and wear down their nerves and muscles four times as fast as before. 
 A newly engaged worker is taken to the factory cinema where he is shown a “model” performance of his job; the work-er is made to “catch up” with that performance. 
 A week laterhe is taken to the cinema again and shown pictures of his own performance, which is then compared with the “model”. 
 All these vast improvements are introduced to the detri-ment of the workers, for they lead to their still greater oppression and exploitation. 
 Moreover, this rational andefficient distribution of labour is confined to each factory . 
 The question naturally arises: What about the distribution of labour in society as a whole? What a vast amount of labouris wasted at present owing to the disorganised and chaot-ic character of capitalist production as a whole! How muchtime is wasted as the raw materials pass to the factory throughthe hands of hundreds of buyers and middlemen, while the requirements of the market are unknown! Not only time, but the actual products are wasted and damaged. 
 And whatabout the waste of time and labour in delivering the finishedgoods to the consumers through a host of small middlemenwho, too, cannot know the requirements of their customersand perform not only a host of superfluous movements, but also make a host of superfluous purchases, journeys, and so on and so forth! Capital organises and rationalises labour within the factory for the purpose of increasing the exploitation of theworkers and increasing profit. 
 In social production as a whole,however, chaos continues to reign and grow, leading to crises when the accumulated wealth cannot find purchas-ers, and millions of workers starve because they are unableto find employment. 
 The Taylor system—without its initiators knowing or wishing it—is preparing the time when the proletariat will take over all social production and appoint its own workers’ committees for the purpose of properly distributing andrationalising all social labour. 
 Large-scale production,machinery, railways, telephone—all provide thousands ofopportunities to cut by three-fourths the working time ofthe organised workers and make them four times better off than they are today. 
 And these workers’ committees, assisted by the workers’ unions, will be able to apply these principles of rationaldistribution of social labour when the latter is freed from itsenslavement by capital.

 A “RESPONSIBLE OPPOSITION ” AND THE PARTICIPATION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL -DEMOCRATS IN THE MARCH 1 CONFERENCE The newspapers have already had a good deal to say about the conference held on March 1 between government spokes-men and certain members of the Duma; however, the impor-tance of this conference as far as the position and aims of the“opposition” in the Duma is concerned, has not by anymeans been sufficiently highlighted. 
 We would remind our readers that just before March 1 a number of liberal newspapers in St. 
 Petersburg, Moscow andthe provinces, raised and animatedly discussed the generalquestion of a Duma in the doldrums, the Duma’s impotenceand lifelessness, of members fleeing from the Duma, the aimsof the opposition, and so forth. 
 Just before March 1, Milyukov and Shingaryov, the most outstanding leaders of the “Constitutional-Democratic” Par-ty, came out in the St. 
 Petersburg and Moscow press againstMr. 
 Struve for his appeals for “reform of the government”,as well as against the Right-wing Cadet V. 
 Maklakov forhis “pessimistic-optimistic ” appeals for an agreement with the Octobrists. 
 Just before March 1, Mr. 
 Milyukov did his utmost to pose as an opponent of Vekhism, i. 
e. 
, of consistentand avowed counter-revolutionary liberalism. 
 * The composition and the character of the March I Confer-ence proved once again that all the flimsy reservations madeby the Constitutional-Democratic Party leaders against P. 
 Struve and V. 
 Maklakov, all their efforts to pose as being “more Left” than the aforesaid politicians, are sheer hypocrisy *See pp. 
 129-31 of this volume.

 and an attempt to hoodwink democrats. 
 In actual fact it was the policy of the Vekhists among the liberals that triumphed at this conference, the policy of Struve and V. 
 Mak-lakov, not of Messrs. 
 Milyukov, Shingaryov and Co. 
, theConstitutional-Democratic Party’s official leaders and dip-lomats. 
 The conference was attended only by representatives of the government parties and of the liberal-bourgeois opposi-tion; neither the Social-Democrats nor the Trudoviks (bour-geois democrats) were invited (on the pretext that they are“anti-militarists on principle, and always vote against allwar credits”. 
 The real reason, however, is that the sponsorsdid not want to receive a reasoned and public refusal, whichwould certainly have been forthcoming, at least from the Social-Democrats). 
 When the opposition members—according to a most of-ficial report in Rech —“attempted to raise the question of our domestic policies ” they were told that the only question that could be discussed was that of war credits, and that “govern-ment spokesmen do not deem it possible at this conference to make any statements on questions concerning domestic policies”. 
 “Nevertheless ,” wrote Rech , “several deputies, among them I. 
 N. 
 Yefremov, A. 
 I. 
 Shingaryov and others, did, in their speeches, touch upon questions concerning the internal situation. 
” So much the more irrelevant, ridiculous, absurd and undig-nified, it must be said concerning this statement, was therole played by the Cadet, Constitutional-Democratic, depu-ties. 
 Were their party called the Moderate Liberal-Monarch-ist Party, i. 
e. 
, a name truly expressing its class nature andits real political character, the conduct of the Constitution-al-Democratic deputies would have been quite normal from the party point of view. 
 But for people who wish to beconsidered democrats, for people among whom even suchRight-wingers as V. 
 Maklakov publicly declare that theyhave lost faith “in the possibility of a way being found out of the impasse without revolutionary upheavals and cata-clysms” (this is exactly how Mr. 
 Shingaryov himself expounded V. 
 Maklakov’s views in Rech No. 
 55, for February 26; and Mr. 
 Milyukov himself wrote in the same vein in the issue of that paper for February 25)—for such people, participa-tion in a conference with the Rights and Octobrists was a public slap in the face. 
 The Constitutional-Democrats slapped their own faces. 
 By participating in the conference they publicly repudiatedtheir own statements about their “loss of faith”. 
 They pub-licly demonstrated their readiness to prove that their faith was alive , and this is tantamount to readiness to serve and be subservient. 
 Trust the Cadets to understand perfectly both the insever-able connection that exists between home and foreign poli-cies and the significance of “allocating credits”....

 THE BREAK -UP OF THE “AUGUST ” BLOC All who are interested in the working-class movement and Marxism in Russia know that a bloc of the liquidators,Trotsky, the Letts, the Bundists and the Caucasians wasformed in August 1912. 
 The formation of this bloc was announced with tremendous ballyhoo in the newspaper Luch , which was founded in St. 
 Petersburg—not with workers’ money—just when theelections were being held, in order to sabotage the will of themajority of the organised workers. 
 It went into rapturesover the bloc’s “large membership”, over the alliance of “Marx-ists of different trends”, over “unity” and non-factionalism, and it raged against the “splitters”, the supporters of theJanuary 1912 Conference. 
 90 The question of “unity” was thus presented to thinking workers in a new and practical light. 
 The facts were to showwho was right: those who praised the “unity” platform and tactics of the August bloc members, or those who said that this was a false signboard, a new disguise for the old,bankrupt liquidators. 
 Exactly eighteen months passed. 
 A tremendous period con-sidering the upsurge of 1912-13. 
 And then, in February 1914,a new journal—this time eminently “unifying” and eminent-ly and truly “non-factional”—bearing the title Borba , was founded by Trotsky, that “ genuine ” adherent of the August platform. 
 Both the contents of Borba ’s issue No. 
 1 and what the liquidators wrote about that journal before it appeared, atonce revealed to the attentive observer that the August bloc had broken up and that frantic efforts were being made to conceal this and hoodwink the workers. 
 But this fraud willalso be exposed very soon. 
 Before the appearance of Borba , the editors of Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta91 published a scathing comment stating: “The real physiognomy of this journal, which has of late been spoken of quite a lot in Marxist circles, is still unclear tous. 
” Think of that, reader: since August 1912 Trotsky has been considered a leader of the August unity bloc; but the wholeof 1913 shows him to have been dissociated from Luch and the Luchists. 
 In 1914, this selfsame Trotsky establishes his own journal, while continuing fictitiously on the staff of Sever-naya Rabochaya Gazeta and Nasha Zarya . 
 “There is a good deal of talk in circles ” about a secret “memorandum”— which the liquidators are keeping dark—written by Trotskyagainst the Luchists, Messrs. 
 F. 
 D. 
, L. 
 M. 
, and similar “strangers”. 
 And yet the truthful, non-factional and unifying Editorial Board of Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta writes: “Its physiog-nomy is still unclear to us! ” It is not yet clear to them that the August bloc has fallen apart! No, Messrs. 
 F. 
 D. 
, L. 
 M. 
 and other Luchists, it is perfect-ly “clear” to you, and you are simply deceiving theworkers. 
 The August bloc—as we said at the time, in August 1912— turned out to be a mere screen for the liquidators. 
 That bloc has fallen asunder . 
 Even its friends in Russia have not been able to stick together. 
 The famous uniters even failed to unite themselves and we got two “August” trends, the Luch-ist trend ( Nasha Zarya and Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta ) and the Trotskyist trend ( Borba ). 
 Both are waving scraps of the “general and united” August banner which they have tornup, and both are shouting themselves hoarse with cries of “unity”! What is Borba ’s trend? Trotsky wrote a verbose article in Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta No. 
 11, explaining this, but the editors of that liquidator newspaper very pointedly re-plied that its “physiognomy is still unclear”. 
 The liquidators do have their own physiognomy, a liberal, not a Marxist one. 
 Anyone familiar with the writings of F. 
 D. 
, L. 
 S. 
, L. 
 M. 
, Yezhov, 92 Potresov and Co. 
 is familiar with this physiognomy. 
 Trotsky, however, has never had any “physiognomy” at all; the only thing he does have is a habit of changing sides, of skipping from the liberals to the Marxists and back again, of mouthing scraps of catchwords and bombastic par-rot phrases. 
 In Borba you will not find a single live word on any con-troversial issue. 
 This is incredible, but it is a fact. 
 The question of the “underground”? Not a word . 
 Does Trotsky share the views of Axelrod, Zasulich, F. 
 D. 
, L. 
 S. 
 ( Luch No. 
 101) and so forth? Not a murmur . 
 The slogan of fighting for an open party? Not a single word . 
 The liberal utterances of the Yezhovs and other Luchists on strikes? The annulment of the programme on the national question? Not a murmur . 
 The utterances of L. 
 Sedov and other Luchists against two of the “pillars” ? Not a murmur . 
 Trotsky assures us that he is in favour of combining immediate demands with ultimateaims, but there is not a word as to his attitude towards the liquidator method of effecting this “combination”! Actually, under cover of high-sounding, empty, and ob-scure phrases that confuse the non-class-conscious workers, Trotsky is defending the liquidators by passing over in si-lence the question of the “underground”, by asserting that thereis no liberal-labour policy in Russia, and the like. 
 Trotsky delivers a long lecture to the seven Duma depu-ties, headed by Chkheidze, instructing them how to repudiatethe “underground” and the Party in a more subtle manner . 
 This amusing lecture clearly points to the further break-up of the Seven. 
 Buryanov has left them. 
 They were unable tosee eye to eye in their reply to Plekhanov. 
 They are now oscillating between Dan and Trotsky, while Chkheidze is evidently exercising his diplomatic talents in an effort topaper over the new cracks. 
 And these near-Party people, who are unable to unite on their own “August” platform, try to deceive the workers with their shouts about “unity”! Vain efforts! Unity means recognising the “old” and combating those who repudiate it. 
 Unity means rallying the majority of theworkers in Russia about decisions which have long been93 known, and which condemn liquidationism. 
 Unity means that members of the Duma must work in harmony with the will of the majority of the workers, which the six workers’ deputies are doing. 
 But the liquidators and Trotsky, the Seven and Trotsky, who tore up their own August bloc, who flouted all the deci-sions of the Party and dissociated themselves from the“underground” as well as from the organised workers, are the worst splitters. 
 Fortunately, the workers have already real-ised this, and all class-conscious workers are creating theirown real unity against the liquidator disruptors of unity. 
 Put Pravdy No. 
 37, Published according to March 15, 1914 the text in Put Pravdy CAPITALISM AND THE PRESS When thieves fall out, honest men come by their own, to some extent. 
 When bourgeois newspapermen quarrel theyreveal to the public the venality of the “big dailies” and thetricks they are up to. 
 N. 
 Snessarev of the Novoye Vremya quarrelled with that newspaper, misappropriated some of its funds, and was dis-missed after a scandal. 
 He has now published a “book” of135 pages entitled The Mirage of “Novoye Vremya ”. 
 As Good as a Novel . 
 St. 
 Petersburg, 1914. 
 Posing, as is the custom, as a “perfect gentleman”, Mr. 
 Snessarev describes the ethics which have long established themselves in the capitalist countries of the West, and which are penetrating more andmore into the bourgeois press in Russia, where of course thesoil is exceptionally favourable for the most sordid and dis-gusting forms of bribery, toadyism, etc. 
, which are practisedwith impunity. 
 “Everybody has gradually become accustomed to live be-yond his means,” this Novoye Vremya man writes with a charm-ing air of “injured innocence”. 
 “When and how society willrid itself of this phenomenon, or whether it will rid itself ofit at all, nobody can tell. 
 But that such is the situationat the present time is a recognised fact. 
” And one of the mag-ic means by which one can live above one’s income is to get bourgeois newspapers to “ participate ” in promoting con-cessions. 
 “I could mention scores of different concessions,”relates our Novoye Vremya -ist, “which owe their existence, not only to certain connections, but also to certain articlespublished in certain newspapers. 
 Novoye Vremya is of course no exception. 
” For example, one day, a representative of the London Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company called on Mr. 
Snessarev and invited him to draft the Articles of Associa-tion of a Russian Marconi Co. 
 and a plan for a concession for that Company. 
 “The remuneration for this work was fixed at 10,000 rubles, and an agreement was reached. 
” The “victimised” Snessarev relates that, not only did he sell himself to the capitalists for this sum, but that thewhole newspaper Novoye Vremya sold itself to conduct “a campaign in favour of the concession”, for which it re-ceived a 50 per cent rebate on telegrams, a “cushy job” as a founder of the Company, and a grant of 50,000 rubles’ worth of shares. 
 London capitalists—fleecing the Russians—concessions from the Russian Government—press participation—whole-sale corruption—anybody and everybody bought and soldfor thousands of rubles—such is the truthful picture revealed by the disgruntled crook Snessarev. 
 Novoye Vremya , an enterprise with millions invested in it, was collapsing. 
 The pampered sons of the renegade million-aire A. 
 S. 
 Suvorin were squandering and dissipatingmillions. 
 This noble newspaper had to be saved. 
 “P. 
 L. 
Bark, Managing Director of the Volga-Kama Bank, appeared on the scene” (p. 
 85). 
 He persuaded A. 
 S. 
 Suvorin to trans-fer the business to a company, whose Articles of Associationhad received His Majesty ’s approval in August 1911. 
 Of the eight hundred shares (at 5,000 rubles per share), 650 went toA. 
 S. 
 Suvorin. 
 In forming the Company they drew up a fic-titious balance-sheet, Mr. 
 Snessarev explains (p. 
 97), adding that “such a balance-sheet could have been accepted either by people totally ignorant of figures, or by people like Mr. 
Guchkov, that is to say, people who know their businessperfectly, but pursue aims of their own”. 
 The heroes of thisCompany’s inauguration (the inaugural meeting was heldon November 10, 1911) were Snessarev himself , P. 
 L. 
 Bark, V. 
 P. 
 Burenin, Octobrist member of the Duma Shubinsky, the sons of that noble renegade A. 
 S. 
 Suvorin, and others. 
 As the reader sees, this highly respectable Company has been operating with great zeal since November 1911, butsince 1912 , the “victimised” Snessarev informs us, Novoye Vremya has been receiving a subsidy in the shape of the ad-vertisements of the Land Banks (“not a very great income”-a mere 15,000 rubles per annum, or “something round aboutthat” figure!). 
 According to the law, these advertisements had to be given to the newspaper with the largest circulation. 
 At that time Novoye Vremya did not have the largest circula-tion, but it “set in motion” (“for the first time”, the noble Snessarev avows) its backstairs influence and connectionsin government circles in order to retain these Land Bank ad-vertisements. 
 “The matter was discussed by the Council ofMinisters and after rather serious hesitation it was decidedto allow Novoye Vremya to retain the advertisements” (p. 
 21). 
 A literary and art society’s club, “in plain words, a gam-bling-house” (p. 
 69) was formed; “in the club’s debt book themembers of the staff of Novoye Vremya had thousands of rubles against their accounts. 
 These debts were simply writtenoff”. 
 In co-operation with Menshikov and others, the stock-broker Manus, who grew rich on the stock exchange and piled up a fortune of “several millions” (p. 
 120), launched a cam-paign in Novoye Vremya demanding Kokovtsov’s resignation from the Cabinet. 
 We leave it to our readers to figure outhow many thousands each of these “public servants” re-ceived, and how much they have yet coming to them. 
 A whirligig of millions began: Novoye Vremya with a bal-ance of five millions, of which about three millions arefictitious; salaries and fees of two and three thousand rublesper month to second-rate and third-rate members of the staff; hundreds of thousands and millions wasted; loansfrom banks amounting to hundreds of thousands; universal corruption; prostitution in all its forms, illegal and legal, sanctified by marriage; the cream of high St. 
 Petersburg so-ciety; millionaires, Cabinet Ministers, stockbrokers and dis-tinguished foreigners; gambling-houses; blackmail in differ-ent forms; “no political convictions” (p. 
 36); envy and in-trigues; Amfiteatrov and Snessarev challenging an engineer to a duel for insulting the editors of Novoye Vremya , who had slung mud at the students; A. 
 S. 
 Suvorin, “who was veryfond” of Amfiteatrov, but “could not deny himself the pleas-ure of annoying him”, by letting through an article by Bu-renin confining a “nasty” dig at the actress Raiskaya, Am-fiteatrov’s wife; Burenin kicks Amfiteatrov out; Suvorin’s scapegrace sons run up debts amounting to hundreds of thous-ands of rubles. 
 Novoye Vremya ’s loss in 1905—150,000 rubles. 
 Scared by 1905, Moscow merchants and manufacturers gave 100,000 rubles to found a patriotic newspaper for work-ers. 
 At their request Novoye Vremya undertook to arrange the matter. 
 The newspaper “dragged out a miserable existence” for two years and then closed down. 
 Muscovites lost 100,000rubles, and the Novoye Vremya people 150,000 rubles (p. 
 61). 
 Thieves, male prostitutes, venal writers, venal newspa-pers. 
 Such is our “big press”. 
 Such is the flower of our “high” society. 
 “Everybody” knows these people; they have connec-tions “everywhere” .... 
 The brazen insolence of feudalists embracing in the dark with the brazen corruption of thebourgeoisie—such is “Holy Russia”. 
 Put Pravdy No. 
 41, Published according to March 20, 1914 the text in Put Pravdy A RADICAL BOURGEOIS ON THE RUSSIAN WORKERS It is sometimes useful to see how people judge us, our work-ers’ press, our workers’ unions, our working-class movement,from outside . 
 It is instructive to know the views of our ene-mies, both overt and covert, the views of indefinite people and indefinite “sympathisers”, if they are at all intelligent and have some idea of politics. 
 Under the latter category undoubtedly comes the “Trudo-vik” or “Popular Socialist”—or, if the truth were to be told,just the ordinary radical bourgeois or bourgeois democrat—Mr. 
 S. 
 Yelpatievsky. 
 This writer is a staunch supporter and associate of N. 
 K. 
 Mikhailovsky, now the object of fulsome praise from the“Left Narodniks”, who, in defiance of common sense, are try-ing to pass themselves off as socialists. 
 Mr. 
 S. 
 Yelpatievsky isa close observer of the life of the Russian man in the street,to whose moods he is so “sensitive”. 
 He may well be called one of Russia’s leading liquidators, seeing that he and his friends, as far back as in the autumn of1906 (see the ill-famed August issue of Russkoye Bogatstvo for 1906), proclaimed the need for an “open party”, attackedthe narrow-mindedness of the “underground”, and startedto touch up the most important slogans of this “underground” in the spirit of an open, that is to say, legal, party. 
 In word, and in the minds of these “Social-Cadets” (as even the Left Narodniks were obliged to call them at the time), their repu-diation of the “underground” and their liquidationist procla-mation of an “open party” or “struggle for an open party”, wereprompted by the desire “to go among the masses”, to organise the masses. 
 In deed, however, the plan of the “Popular Socialists” contained nothing but philistine, petty-bourgeois faint-heart-edness (in regard to the masses) and credulity (in regard to the authorities). 
 For their advocacy of an “open party” some of them were threatened with the lock-up and some were kept there, and as a result, they remained without any con-tact with the masses, open or otherwise, and without a partyof any kind, open or otherwise. 
 They remained what our liq-uidators now are, namely, a group of liquidator legalists,a group of “independent” writers (independent of the “under-ground”, but ideologically dependent on liberalism). 
 The period of despondency, collapse and disintegration has passed. 
 New currents are stirring, and Mr. 
 S. 
 Yelpatiev-sky, who is so sensitive to man-in-the-street moods, has writ-ten an article, published in this year’s January issue of Rus-skoye Bogatstvo , on the moods of the different classes in Rus-sian society. 
 The article bears the pretentious title “Life Goes On”. 
 Life goes on, our Narodnik exclaims, calling to mind all kinds of congresses, Salazkin’s speech 94 and the Beilis case. 
 Things are undoubtedly stirring in the provinces, although“it is sometimes difficult now to distinguish, not only the Right Cadet from the Left Octobrist, but the Socialist-Revo-lutionary and the Social-Democrat [you mean liquidatorSocial-Democrat, don’t you, Mr. 
 Narodnik liquidator?]from the Left Cadet, judging by local [and, of course, exclu-sively legal] tactics”. 
 “Something like a unification of Rusis taking place on either side of the wall dividing Russia. 
 On one side have rallied the united aristocracy, the united bu-reaucracy, the civil servants and other folk who ‘live on theTreasury’; on the other side—just the rank and file, the massof provincial society”. 
 Our Narodnik’s outlook, as you see, is not broad, and his analysis is shallow—the same old liberal contraposing of government and society. 
 It is rather difficult to say anything about the class struggle within society, about bourgeoisieand workers, about the growing dissension between liberal-ism and democracy from the standpoint of the provincialman in the street. 
 It is difficult to draw conclusions about the rural masses, writes Mr. 
 S. 
 Yelpatievsky. 
 “Darkness and silence hung over the countryside, where it was difficult to see anything and from where it was hard to hear any-thing” .... 
 The co-operative movement “suddenly burst forth, spreading far and wide” ... the struggle between the otrub 95 and the commune peasants ... “ all this did not stand out clearly enough ”. 
 “Admittedly, the wall that is being flung up between the otrub and the commune peasants as a result of the government’s efforts to divide and split the rural masses is rising higher and higher, but the countryside has evidently not yet produced the feeling and senti-ment suitable to the government’s aims. 
 The desire for and expec-tation of land still continue to burn brightly in the hearts of both, and the desire for freedom, for ‘rights’, which was formerly obscuredby the ‘land’, is evidently becoming increasingly stronger and more compelling. 
” After observing that “it is the Right-wing circles that are now persistently repeating the word revolution”, that thesecircles “are really scared, really expect a conflict, and areconvinced that a catastrophe is unavoidable”, our chronicler of Russian life ends up by saying this about the workers: “I need not say anything here about the organised workers. 
 There is no need to grope there for one ’s conclusions —everything there is clear and visible to all. 
 Opinions there are fairly definitely established , there are not only desires and expectations there , but also demands , reinforced by volitional impulses —not sporadic outbreaks , but systematised and fairly well developed methods .... 
 [The dots are Mr. 
 Yelpatievsky’s. 
] And , undoubtedly , opinions , desires and expectations percolate from this organised environment into the rural environment from which it sprang . 
” This was written by a man who has never been a Marxist and has always stood aloof from the “organised workers”. 
And this appraisal of things from outside is all the more valuable to the class-conscious workers. 
 Mr. 
 Yelpatievsky, one of the “foremost” leaders of liquida-tionism, would do well to ponder over the implications ofthe admission he has been obliged to make. 
 For one thing, among which workers does he find “fairly definitely established opinions” and “fairly well developed and systematised methods”? Only among the opponents of liquidationism (because, among the liquidators themselves,there is complete chaos in opinions and methods); only among those who have not hurried faint-heartedly to turn theirbacks on the “underground”. 
 Only among these, indeed, “everything is clear and visible to all ”. 
 Paradoxically enough, it is a fact that chaos reigns among those who yearn for an “open party”, that “everything is clear and visible toall”, that “opinions are fairly definitely established and meth-ods fairly well developed” only among the adherents of the “underground”, among those who are faithful to the precepts of this allegedly bigoted and hidebound “underground”(cf. 
 Nasha Zarya , Luch , Novaya Rabochaya Gazeta and Se-vernaya Rabochaya Gazeta ). 
 The first to give birth to liquidationism (Mr. 
 Yelpa-tievsky, leader of Russkoye Bogatstvo ) was the first to sign its death warrant and read the burial service at its grave. 
 Although Mr. 
 Yelpatievsky himself may not be aware of it, the question he raises is far beyond the understanding of certain politicians. 
 Secondly—and this is most important of all—why is it that in one of the most turbulent and difficult periods ofRussian history, in the five years 1908-13, the proletariatwas the only class of all the classes in the Russian nation that did not “grope” its way about? Why was it only amongthe proletariat that “everything is clear and visible to all”? Why is the proletariat emerging from the state of utter ideo-logical disintegration and collapse and vacillation in matters concerning programme, tactics and organisation—such as now reign among the liberals, the Narodniks and intellectu-alist “would-be Marxists”—with “opinions fairly definitely established” and with “methods systematised and fairly welldeveloped”? It is not only because these opinions were estab-lished and these methods developed by the “underground”, but because there are profound social causes, economic con-ditions and factors which are operating more and more effec-tively with every new mile of railway that is built, andwith every advance that is made in trade, industry and cap-italism in town and countryside, factors which increase, strengthen, steel and unite the proletariat and keep it from following the lead of the man in the street, keep it from wav-ering like philistines, from faint-heartedly renouncing the“underground”. 
 Those who ponder on this will realise the enormous harm that is caused by attempts to “fuse” into a single party the advanced members of the wage-worker class and the inevi-tably wavering and unstable petty-bourgeois peasantry. 
 Prosveshcheniye No. 
 3, Published according to March 1914 the text in Prosveshcheniye POLITICAL LESSONS Some time ago, the Council of State rejected the proposal that Polish should be the official language in the future self-governing Poland. 
 This vote, which took place against thewishes of the head of the Ministry, throws considerable light on the question of Russia’s master classes and on the “specif-ic features” of our political system and administration. 
 The long history of the Polish language question in con-nection with Polish self-government has been highlighted inthe press. 
 The Russian landlords, who are at the helm of thestate, started negotiations with the Polish aristocracy on this question a long time ago, as far back as 1907. 
 The terms were discussed for at least co-operation, or simply arelatively peaceful cohabitation between the Russian BlackHundreds and the Polish Black Hundreds. 
 And all this wasdone, of course, entirely and solely in the interests of the“national culture”. 
 Polish national culture was defended by the Polish land-lords, who bargained for self-government (instead of autono-my) and for Polish as the official language. 
 Russian nationalculture was defended by the Great-Russian landlords, whostipulated (possessing everything, they had no need to bar-gain) supremacy for Russian national culture and the sever-ance from Poland of the “Russian” Holm area. 
 The two par-ties made a deal, which, among other things, was directedagainst the Jews, whom they reduced in advance to a rest-rictive “ numerus clausus ”, so that Poland should not lag be-hind Russia in Black-Hundred baiting and oppression ofthe Jews. 
 Stolypin is reported to have conducted these negotiations with the Polish aristocracy, the land magnates of Poland, inperson. 
 Stolypin made promises. 
 The bills were introduced. 
 But ... the Holm area found itself detached from Poland, whereas the Polish language in a self-governing Poland was rejected by our Council of State. 
 Stolypin’s cause was “faithfully and truly” championed by Kokovtsov, but with-out avail. 
 The Right members of the Council of State didnot support him. 
 Here is another agreement, although a minor one, that was “torn up”. 
 Recently, Guchkov stated in the name of the all-Russian bourgeoisie that the latter had entered into a tacit agreement with the counter-revolutionary government“to support it in return for reforms”. 
 The support was given,but no reforms ensued. 
 In the example we have quoted, it was not the bourgeoisie, not the opposition, but the blue-blooded landlords who con-cluded what was also a tacit agreement, viz. 
, “we” shall take a step towards Stolypin, and shall receive self-govern-ment, with the Polish language. 
 They took the step, but re-ceived no Polish language Valuable political lessons are to be learnt from this small example. 
 The struggle of nationalities is developing before our eyes into a deal between the ruling classes of two nations, in which special provision is made for the oppression of athird nation (the Jewish). 
 We must not forget that all rulingclasses, the bourgeoisie as well as the landlords, even themost democratic bourgeoisie, behave in the same way. 
 Russia’s real political system and administration are revealed in their class basis: the landlords give the orders; they decide and rule. 
 The power of this class is supreme. 
 Itgives the bourgeoisie “access” ... only to agreements, which ittears up . 
 Nor is that all. 
 It appears that even within the master class itself agreements are “torn up” with extraordinary and supernatural ease. 
 This is what distinguishes Russia from other class states; this constitutes our exceptionalism, underwhich problems resolved in Europe two hundred or a hun-dred years ago are still unresolved here. 
 Prosveshcheniye No. 
 3, Published according to March 1914 the text in Prosveshcheniye Signed: V. 
 Ilyin THE NATIONA L EQUALIT Y BILL96 Comrades: The Russian Social-Democratic Labour group in the Duma has decided to introduce in the Fourth Duma a Bill to abolish the disabilities of the Jews and other non-Russians. 
 The text of this Bill you will find below. 
 The Bill aims at abolishing all national restrictions against all nations: Jews, Poles, and so forth. 
 But it deals inparticular detail with the restrictions against the Jews. 
The reason is obvious: no nationality in Russia is so oppressedand persecuted as the Jewish. 
 Anti-Semitism is strikingever deeper root among the propertied classes. 
 The Jewish workers are suffering under a double yoke, both as workers and as Jews. 
 During the past few years, the persecution ofthe Jews has assumed incredible dimensions. 
 It is sufficientto recall the anti-Jewish pogroms and the Beilis case. 
 In view of these circumstances, organised Marxists must devote proper attention to the Jewish question. 
 It goes without saying that the Jewish question can effec-tively be solved only together with the fundamental issuesconfronting Russia today. 
 Obviously, we do not look to thenationalist-Purishkevich Fourth Duma to abolish the re-strictions against the Jews and other non-Russians. 
 But it isthe duty of the working class to make its voice heard. 
 And the voice of the Russian workers must be particularly loud in protest against national oppression. 
 In publishing the text of our Bill, we hope that the Jewish workers, the Polish workers, and the workers of the other oppressed nationalities will express their opinion of it andpropose amendments, should they deem it necessary. 
 At the same time we hope that the Russian workers will give particularly strong support to our Bill by their declara-tions, etc. 
 In conformity with Article 4 we shall append to the Bill a special list of regulations and laws to be rescinded. 
 This appendix will cover about a hundred such laws affecting the Jews alone. 
 A BILL FOR THE ABOLITION OF ALL DISABILITIES OF THE JEWS AND OF ALL RESTRICTIONS ON THE GROUNDS OF ORIGIN OR NATIONALITY 1. 
 Citizens of all nationalities inhabiting Russia are equal before the law. 
 2. 
 No citizen of Russia, regardless of sex and religion, may be restricted in political or in any other rights on the grounds of origin or nationality. 
 3. 
 All and any laws, provisional regulations, riders to laws, and so forth, which impose restrictions upon Jews inany sphere of social and political life, are herewith abol-ished. 
 Article 767, Vol.

 48, Published according to March 28, 1914 the text in Put Pravdy FARM LABOURERS ’ WAGES Wages in the manufacturing industry are known to have risen by about twenty per cent since 1905. 
 A first attempt to study the situation as regards the wages of agricultural labourers was made in the recently pub-lished pamphlet by I. 
 Drozdov, The Wages of Farm Labourers in Russia in Connection with the Agrarian Movement in 1905-06 (St. 
 Petersburg, 1914, published by M. 
 I. 
 Semyo-nov, price 50 kopeks). 
 We shall deal with the main conclu-sions of this interesting treatise. 
 The farm labourer’s average daily wage in European Rus-sia was as follows (in kopeks): Kopeks Per cent Average for 1902-04 ....

6 These figures show that the highest increase in wages oc-curred in 1906, the very year when the impact of the 1905movement must have been at its strongest. 
 Thus, beginning with 1905, an increase was achieved also in the incredibly low pay of farm labourers! That this progress is still far from adequate is evident from a compari-son between money wages and grain prices. 
 The author ofthe pamphlet made this comparison and expressed the moneywages of farm labourers quoted above in terms of grain (rye) at average local prices. 
 He found that wages expressed in terms of grain dropped from 0. 
93 poods in 1902-04 to 0. 
85 poods in 1905 and 0. 
91 poods in 1906. 
 In other words, for his day’s pay the farm labourer in Rus-sia could buy 0. 
93 poods of rye in 1902-04 and only 0. 
91 poods in 1906. 
 Obviously, if not for the impetus of 1905 and 1906, the reduction in real wages would have been even greater. 
 Wages fluctuate considerably from year to year according to the harvest and other causes. 
 For example, between 1905and 1907 wages rose, though very unevenly, and then in 1908 (the year when the reaction was strongest) they dropped , to rise slightly again in 1909 and 1910. 
 In view of the fluctuation of wages from year to year, it is necessary to take for the purposes of comparison, not in-dividual years, but decades. 
 Making such a comparison,Mr. 
 Drozdov defines the average wage of farm labourers in European Russia for the ten years 1891-1900 at 55. 
08 kopeks per day, and for the subsequent ten years (1901-10) at 69. 
18kopeks per day. 
 This shows an increase of 25. 
5 per cent. 
 This means that three million farm labourers in Russia (the number is undoubtedly greatly understated) securedincreases in pay amounting to about eighty million rubles per year , if we count only 200 working days per year. 
 True, during this period, the price of food products increased on an average by 20. 
5 per cent. 
 Hence, the actual increase in wages, or increase in real wages, was very slight. 
 Express-ing daily money wages in terms of grain, the author found anincrease of only 3. 
9 per cent during the revolutionary ten years as compared with the pre-revolutionary ten years. 
 Thus, by exerting all their efforts the labourers succeededin keeping wages at their former level and in raising them only very slightly . 
 On the other hand, a comparison of the changes in labour-ers’ wages and in the price of land during the same two decades reveals an enormous increase in the incomes of the landed gentry . 
 Purchasing land means purchasing the income obtained from the land; it means purchasing rent ; the price of land is therefore capitalised rent. 
 We see that during thetwo decades the average price per dessiatine rose from R. 
69. 
1to R. 
132. 
4, i. 
e. 
, almost doubled ! The wages of millions of hired workers increased by one-fourth . 
 The incomes of the landlords doubled . 
 Wages barely kept pace with the price of food products, but the landlords’ incomes rose five times as high as the price of food products. 
 The landowners and well-to-do peasant proprietors are grow-ing steadily richer. 
 It should be borne in mind that the increase in the income from land and the increase in the price of agricultural producesteadily and inevitably widen the class gulf between therural bourgeois and the rural proletarian, between the small proprietor (albeit a “labouring” proprietor) and the wage-worker. 
 Therefore, those who say to the “labouring” peasants: under capitalism your small farm will not save you from pov-erty and want, your only salvation lies in joining the hired workers—speak the truth. 
 But those who, like our “Narod-niks”, try to defend the interests of the “labouring” peasanteconomy and declare that petty economy is viable under capitalism—such people foster bourgeois aspirations, culti-vate the bourgeois, non-proletarian “streak” in the smallproprietor, and speak like bourgeois.

 I. 
 THE LETTISH WORKERS AND THE SPLIT IN THE SOCIAL -DEMOCRATIC GROUP IN THE DUMA Workers who read the liquidationist press know how often the Russian liquidators have boasted about the Let-tish Marxist workers being on their side. 
 When the liqui-dators split the Social-Democratic group in the Duma, they also repeatedly referred to the Letts. 
 “Nobody wouldthink of accusing the Lettish Social-Democratic workers ofrepudiating the ‘underground’,” they wrote, “and yet theseLettish workers are on our side. 
” Those who knew the facts never doubted that the liqui-dators were ... deviating from the truth. 
 When the question of the Six and the Seven came up for discussion, the over-whelming majority of these Lettish workers declared infavour of the Six. 
 Pravda published scores of resolutions passed by many hundreds of Lettish Social-Democraticworkers and quite a number of groups in Riga, Mitau, Libau, and other centres, in defence of the stand taken by the six workers’ deputies. 
 Next after St. 
 Petersburg, thecity that expressed itself most emphatically on this questionwas Riga, that important Lettish working-class centre. 
The resolutions passed by the overwhelming majority ofRiga workers breathed a spirit of ardent devotion to the ideas of consistent Marxism, and of sincere indignation with the liquidators. 
 But one thing is true: eager support, for the liquidators and their Seven came from the Lettish “leadership”. 
 TheLettish newspaper, which was then controlled by the liqui-dators, published articles against the Six which, by their scandalous tone and liquidationist content, put them on a par with the articles published in the St. 
 Petersburg organof the Russian liquidators. 
 True, only a very insignificant number of the Lettish workers supported the liquidationist campaign. 
 The “lead-ing” body, however, was on the side of the liquidators, and they continued to speak “on behalf of” the Lettishorganised proletariat.... 
 But some time elapsed and representatives of all Lettish Marxist workers met. 
 97 Naturally, the question of the split in the Duma Social-Democratic group was a high point in their proceedings. 
 The “leading” liquidators did everything they possibly could to back the Seven, or, atleast, to get the question shelved. 
 Alas, they failed. 
Through their official representatives 98 the Lettish Social-Democratic workers adopted the following resolution (wequote it verbatim, except for unavoidable changes): “The split in the Social-Democratic group in the Duma . 
 “Representatives of all the Lettish Marxist workers express their profound regret over the split in the Social-Democrat-ic group in the Duma and are of the opinion that this splitwas the inevitable consequence of the split outside the group, among the Russian Marxists. 
 “They emphasise that the unity of the group is essential, and declare that this unity can be achieved: “1) if unity is based on the decisions adopted by the supreme institutions of the Marxist body prior to the splitin the latter, namely, the Programme of the Marxist body, its Rules , the London decisions , the decisions of the all-Russia representative body of the Marxists of December 1908 and of January 1910 ; “2)if a mode of joint activity is found , which will safeguard the rights of the minority in the group . 
 “The Lettish Marxist workers instruct their leading body to support all steps towards unity in keeping with the views expressed in this resolution . 
” Such is the resolution. 
 As the reader will see, its gist is that recognition of the old Marxist body is made an essen-tial condition of unity. 
 With those who do not recognisethe Programme, Rules, and decisions of 1907, 1908 and 1910, 99 unity is impossible. 
 That is what the Lettish work-ers said. 
 And that is what makes the Lettish resolutionso important. 
 Conciliatory trends were undoubtedly very strong at the Lettish Congress. 
 The Letts did not want to tell the liquida-tionist group in the Duma plainly and bluntly that it was a group of splitters, who were flouting the will of the work-ers, and that they ought to resign from the Duma. 
 Theydid not want to do that, evidently because the Lettishminority does not go to the same lengths as the Russianliquidators, and also because the Letts still have hopes of a possible reconciliation with the Chkheidze group. 
 At all events, the Lettish workers formulated precise and clear conditions of unity. 
 How are the issues that split the group in the Duma resolved from the point of view of the Lettish resolu-tion? The Letts demand, firstly, acceptance of the Programme. 
 This means that they condemn advocacy of the famous “cul-tural-national autonomy” from the Duma rostrum. 
 Forthe Programme officially rejected this demand, and evenliquidator L. 
 Martov has admitted that “cultural-nationalautonomy” is scarcely in keeping with the Programme. 
 If unity is to become possible, the liquidators must renounce cultural-national autonomy. 
 Such is the meaning of theLettish reply to the first point at issue. 
 Next comes the dispute about admitting deputy Jagiello into the group. 
 How do the Lettish workers settle this dispute? They say: see the decision of December 1908. 
 We take up this document, look and read: “On amalgamation with the P. 
S. 
P. 
 Left-wing. 
“After hearing the proposal of our Menshevik comrades concerning amalgamation with the P. 
S. 
P. 
 Left-wing,the all-Russia representative body of the Marxists pro-ceeds without debate to the order of the day. 
” (See Report, p. 
 46. 
) The thing is clear. 
 The all-Russia decision of 1908 flatly rejected the proposal to amalgamate with Jagiello’sparty in any shape or form. 
 The liquidators violated this decision. 
 Consequently, they must reverse their splittingdecision concerning Jagiello. 
 Further, the Letts demand acceptance of all decisions on points of principle adopted in December 1908 and January1910. 
 What are these decisions? And how do they appraise liquidationism? We take the documents concerned and read: “Whereas in a number of areas attempts have been ob-served on the part of some of the Party intelligentsia to liqui-date the ‘underground’ and to substitute for it an amorphousfederation acting at all costs within the limits of legality,even at the cost of openly abandoning the programme, tac-tics and traditions of the Marxist body ... holds that it is necessary to wage a relentless struggle against the liqui-dators ’ attempts , and calls upon all truly Marxist workers, irrespective of group or trend, to offer the most strenuousresistance to these attempts. 
” This is how the 1908 decisions condemned liquidationism (see p. 
 38 of the Report). 
 The Letts demanded acceptance of these decisions. 
 Next come the decisions of January 1910. 
 Here we read: “The historical situation in the Social-Democratic movementin the period of bourgeois counter-revolution inevitablygives rise— as a manifestation of the bourgeois influence on the proletariat —to ... repudiation of the illegal Party, belit-tling of its role and importance, and attempts to whittle down the programmatic and tactical tasks and the slogansof the entire body of Marxists. 
” Thus did the decisions of 1910 condemn liquidationism. 
 And it was the Letts again who demanded recognition ofthese decisions by the liquidators. 
 The Lettish resolution was adopted unanimously . 
 Even the Lettish liquidators who were present dared not voteagainst it. 
 They had received a sufficiently severe lessonfrom the Lettish workers, who respect the “underground”and recognise the decisions of the old body of Marxists. 
To vote against this resolution would have meant defying the whole Lettish proletariat and losing their last support-ers among the workers. 
 Such were the decisions of the Lettish workers (over three thousand organised workers being represented). 
 In a very polite form, without using a single harsh word, but nonetheless firmly and emphatically, the Lettish workers said to the Chkheidze group: “Do you want unity? Then recognise the extremely impor-tant decisions of the old body of Marxists, retract your violations of the Programme and decisions of 1908-10, repudiate those who have repudiated the ‘underground’; in short, take your stand on the basis of Marxism. 
” The last really workers’ organisation, in whose name the Chkheidze group tried to speak, turned its back on thatgroup. 
 As was to be expected, only a handful of liquidatorsnow support the seven deputies who are inclining towardsliquidationism. 
 The proletarian element is abandoning or has already abandoned them. 
 A group without workers —such is the liquidationist group in the Duma. 
 After the Letts’ decision, this is now absolutely indispu-table. 
 Put Pravdy No. 
 50, Published according to March 30, 1914 the text in Put Pravdy THE “AUGUST ” FICTION EXPOSED Over eighteen months ago, in August 1912, there occurred an event of fairly great importance in the history of theworking-class movement in Russia, On the eve of the electionsto the Fourth Duma, the liquidators “united” with, as they put it, the representatives of different trends at the August Conference, thereby attempting to prove that they were notliquidators at all, that they had not liquidated anything,and had no intention of doing so, and that “unity” betweenthem and the really serious, non-fictitious workers’ Marxistorganisations was quite possible. 
 The August Conference shifted the dispute between the liquidators and their opponents to a different plane: itbecame, not only a question of whether the liquidators’theory and tactics were correct, but also of whether theliquidators’ utterances were confirmed or refuted by their own deeds. 
 Was their August Conference a fiction, make-be-lieve, a fraud and a bubble, or was it a serious affair, a sincere step, something real that showed the possibility of the liqui-dators rectifying their errors? That is how the matter stood. 
The liquidators’ deeds, the results of their August Con-ference, had to provide an answer to this question. 
 This answer has now been given by the only Marxist body, namely, the Lettish Marxists, recognised by all trends and groups without exception as Marxists who havenot violated Party decisions, and have themselves gone through the famous August experience. 
 We learn from well-informed sources that the meeting of the highest representa-tives of the organised Lettish Marxists in Russia has drawn to a close. 
 The supremely authoritative character of thisassembly of representatives of the Lettish organised Marx-ists has not been challenged by anyone, not by a single trend or by a single group; on the contrary, it was attended by representatives and authorised delegates, not only from the majority of the workers of Russia (anti-liquidators),but also from the liquidators , from their leading, August body, as well as from the Bund and the P. 
S. 
P. 
 Left-wing. 
 The eighteen months’ experience of August blocs and institutions was discussed from every angle and appraised by those who had themselves gone through this experience inan endeavour to help the liquidators rid themselves ofliquidationism. 
 What was the upshot of this discussion and appraisal?“The attempt on the part of the conciliators ,” the deci-sion of the Lettish organised Marxists reads , “to unite at all costs with the liquid ator s (the August Conference of 1912 ) proved fruitless , and the uniters themselves became ideolog-ically and politically dependent upon the liquidators ”.... 
 This is the official decision of an unbiased body of Marx-ists, which fully and conclusively exposes the August fiction! What we have been saying for two years, and what the liquidators—while calling God to witness, and heapingabuse upon us—have been denying, has now been provedand officially declared by those who themselves participated in the August Conference, in the August bloc, and in the leading August body. 
 The Lettish organised Marxists have officially admitted that the “focal point of the inner-Party struggle during thepast five years has been the question of the liquidationisttrend” long ago condemned by the entire Party, and thattheir, the Lettish, representative was being recalled from the August leading body because that body (so runs the decision of the Lettish Marxists) “ has not dissociated itself from the liquidators ”. 
 Thus, events have fully proved that we were right, and have once again exposed the liquidators. 
 We were rightwhen we said that the August Conference was a fiction, an imposture, a customary (in petty-bourgeois parties and groups) pre-election fraud . 
 The liquidators dared not go to the elections with their banner and honestly stand by their convictions; they hid behind the August bloc, calling God to witness that they were not liquidating-anything. 
 The Letts have exposed this fraud. 
 Mind you, these Letts were and remain neutral , so neu-tral that they decided not to enter into any organisationalrelations with any section of the Russian organised Marxists!The exposure of the August fiction and of the liquidators’election masquerade is the more significant for its coming from neutral organisations. 
 We shall have more than one occasion to revert to the decisions of the Lettish Marxists, which prove once againhow right we were when we said that the unity of the Marx-ist workers in Russia was possible only in opposition to the liquidators. 
 In conclusion, we would mention only one particularly important decision on the national principle in the Marxist organisation. 
 The Lettish Marxists themselves represent the workers of a disfranchised and oppressed nation, and conduct theiractivities in centres with very mixed populations. 
 In Riga,for example, they have to deal with German, Russian, Let-tish, Jewish and Lithuanian proletarians. 
 Long years of experience have firmly convinced the Lettish Marxists ofthe correctness of the principle of international unity in the local organisations of the working class. 
 “In every city ,” the Lettish Marxists ’ decision reads , “there must be one united organisation of Marxist proletari-ans, which must operate on the lines recognised by the Stock-holm Congress , and in conformity with the commentaries of the All-Russia Conference of 1908 . 
” These commentaries, as we know, definitely condemned the principle of federation. 
 Not the federation of nationalworkers’ organisations, but international unity, a single organisation that conducts activities in all the languages spoken by the proletariat in every local area. 
 That is the only correct principle of Marxism. 
 That is the only socialist form of resistance to the nationalist phi-listines, who are trying to split the proletariat into national sections . 
 That is a demand for the decision of the entire Party to be carried out, a decision the Bund has violat-ed and is continuing to violate in a most flagrantmanner. 
 An end is coming to the deception sown among the workers by the liquidators and Bundists, who are causing a split while trying to shout loudest about “unity”. 
 The decision of the Lettish Marxists, who are neutral in our (Russian)conflict, has conclusively proved to all workers that realunity can and must be built up only in opposition to those splitters who defy the Party’s long-standing and constantdemand for the abandoning of liquidationism and of the principle that workers’ organisations should be divided according to nationality.

 Ilyin Less than a decade separates us from the turbulent period of 1905, and yet the change that has taken place in Russia in this short time seems tremendous. 
 Russia seems all atonce to have changed from a patriarchal into a moderncapitalist country. 
 Leo Tolstoy, the ideologist of the oldRussia, expressed this in a characteristic and rueful tiradewhen he complained that the Russian people “have learnt with astonishing rapidity to make revolutions and parlia-ments”. 
 101 Naturally, Russia’s “sudden” transformation into a bour-geois country in a matter of five or ten years in the twentiethcentury was possible only because the entire second halfof the preceding century had been a stage in the transition from the feudal to the bourgeois system. 
 It is interesting to note how this change affected the attitude towards Marxism of our official, university scienceof political economy. 
 In the good old days, only governmentprofessors of the extreme right engaged in the business of“demolishing” Marx. 
 Liberal-Narodnik professorial scholar-ship as a whole treated Marx with respect, “recognised” the labour theory of value, and thereby created the naïveillusion among “Left Narodniks” that in Russia there wasno soil for a bourgeoisie. 
 Today, there has “suddenly” sprung up in this country a host of liberal and progressive “Marxophobes”, among them men like Mr. 
 Tugan-Baranovsky, * or Mr. 
 Struve, etc. 
 All of them have disclosed the true content and significance of liberal-Narodnik “respect” for Marx. 
 In word, their respecthas remained, but in deed, their long-standing inability tounderstand materialist dialectics and the theory of the classstruggle has inevitably led them to renounce the theory of labour value. 
 *See pp.

 Until 1905 the bourgeoisie saw no other enemy than, the feudalists and the “bureaucrats”; that is why they tried to be sympathetic towards the theory espoused by the European proletariat, and tried not to see the “enemy on theleft”. 
 After 1905, a counter-revolutionary liberal bourgeoisieappeared in Russia, and professorial, liberal scholarship,without the slightest loss of prestige in “society”, seriously proceeded to demolish Marx. 
 We propose to acquaint the reader with the latest schol-arly work of one of these “serious” scholars. 
 I Last year V. 
 P. 
 Ryabushinsky published Part I of Mr. 
 Pyotr Struve’s work The Economy and Prices (M. 
 1913). 
 The celebrated “alliance between science and industry”,which was first marked by Mr. 
 Ryabushinsky’s publicationof Mr. 
 Struve’s discourse on “Great Russia”, has gainedstrength and attained full stature. 
 From a simple alliancebetween science and industry there has now emerged an alliance between science, industry and the authorities, for Mr. 
 Struve submitted his research as a treatise for a scientificdegree, which has been conferred on him. 
 In his preface Mr. 
 Struve assures us that he planned this work about fifteen years ago. 
 Consequently, we haveevery reason to expect a piece of serious and solid research. 
 The author himself holds a very high opinion of his work, in which he promises to “revise” (“critically”, ofcourse) “certain traditional problems and principles ofpolitical economy”. 
 The revision also involves the sig-nificance of price “as the fundamental concept of politicaleconomy”. 
 “This revision will lead to the posing of new methodological prob-lems for our science in the spirit of consistent empiricism, based onstrictly evolved, precise concepts and clear distinctions. 
” This sentence, taken from the concluding lines of Mr. 
 Struve’s “work”, contains the leit-motif , as it were, of his treatise. 
 The author’s programme is “consistent empiricism”(this is how any fashionable philosopher starts in our day, no matter what sanctimonious humbug his theory may lead up to) and the “strict evolution of precise concepts and clear distinctions”. 
 The familiar motive of the celebrated “criti-cism”, which so often amounts to nothing more than verbal scholasticism .... 
 Mr. 
 Struve wants to see “consistent empiricism” particu-larly in that part of his book, by far the larger, in whichhe gives “sketches and materials on the historical phenom-enology of price” (this takes up nearly the whole of Section2 of Part I). 
 And by “strict evolution of precise concepts and clear distinctions” he means his disquisition, in Section 1 and in the Introduction, on “some fundamental philosophi-cal motives in the development of economic thinking”, on“the economy and society”, etc. 
 We shall first deal with these fundamental theoretical reflections of Mr. 
 Struve’s. 
 II “The normative, ethical conception of worth ( tsennost ) [value ( stoimost ); Mr. 
 Struve persistently uses the wrong term “worth” instead of “value”, although the incorrectness of this was proved to him long ago] that still prevails also among the canonists, is not so far removed as it may seemfrom the conception of worth as the intrinsic ‘basis’ or‘law’ of price. 
 Indeed, we see that the ‘ bonitas intrinseca ’ ‘valor ’, and ‘ pretium naturale ’ * of the canonists is trans-formed into the ‘ intrinsic value ’, or ‘ natural value ’, or ‘natural price ’, i. 
e. 
, the objective worth ** of the later economists” (XXV). 
 Here we see Mr. 
 Struve’s main idea (or rather his main ide-ophobia) and the typical methods of this author. 
 To discreditthe scientific law of value, Mr. 
 Struve tries hard to identifyit with the “ethical” law of the canonists. 
 Mr. 
 Struve, of course, cannot produce a shred of evidence to support this. 
 Considering that he writes “we see” in a footnote referringto a passage (and an irrelevant one at that) in the work of a *Intrinsic utility; price, worth, and natural price. 
— Ed. 
 **Incidentally, in admitting that the “later” (compared with the medieval canonists) economists have in mind precisely objective “worth”, Mr. 
 Struve immediately reveals the incorrectness of his own subjectivist insistence on the word “worth” as against “objective”“value ”. 
 Russian Kantian of 1810, one can imagine what diffi-culty our scholar had in his search for proofs! Mr. 
 Struve cannot but know that in the Middle Ages all scientific laws, not only the law of value, were understoodin a religious and ethical sense. 
 Even the laws of naturalscience were interpreted by the canonists in the same way. 
Therefore, the identification of the canonists’ law of pricewith that of the representatives of classical political econ-omy simply cannot be taken seriously. 
 This “idea” of Mr. 
 Struve’s could hardly be called an idea; it is simplyideophobia covered up with a purely childish trick. 
 Mr. 
 Struve continues:“The ‘law of worth’ becomes the ‘ idée fixe ’ of political economy. 
 And in this sphere the ‘universalist’ (‘realistic’) thought motive stands out most clearly in the works of an author who blends it with the greatest sweep of general-philosophical conception of economic science, namely,Marx . 
 In his works this motive is combined with a materialist world outlook that is all the more valuable for not beingelaborated in detail. 
 He turned labour value, not only into a law, but also into the ‘substance’ of price. 
 We have shown more than once in our works the way in which this mechan-ically naturalist and at the same time ‘realistic’ conceptionof worth vainly tries to embrace the world of empiricalphenomena of economic life and culminates in a colossaland hopeless contradiction. 
” This is a striking illustration of Mr. 
 Struve’s “scientific” method! This is his method of annihilating Marx! A coupleof pseudo-scientific terms, a hint at thought motives, and areference to a short magazine article in Zhizn 102 in 1900— that is all he can boast of. 
 That is not much, Professor! In his brief magazine articles Mr. 
 Struve failed to prove that there was any kind of contradiction, let alone a “co-lossal” one, between Vol. 
 I and Vol. 
 III of Marx’sCapital , between the labour theory of value and the forma-tion of average price on the basis of the law of value. 
 The medieval “distinction” between nominalism and real-ism and the contraposition of universalism and singular-ism, which Mr. 
 Struve juggles with, add nothing whatever to our understanding of Marx’s theory, to criticism of it, orto the clarification of Mr. 
 Struve’s own theory (or what he claims to be his own theory). 
 It is juggling, scientific junk, but not science. 
 Of course, in the controversy between medieval nominalists and realists there is some analogy with the controversy between materialists and idealists,but analogies and historical continuity can be establishedbetween very many other theories, not only into the MiddleAges, but also into ancient times. 
 To study seriously thelinks between the controversies of at least the Middle Ages and the history of materialism, special research would be required. 
 Our author’s book, however, contains no tracewhatever of a serious study of the subject. 
 He flits from subjectto subject, hints at a thousand questions without examininga single one, and with a boldness that is amusing enunciatesthe most emphatic conclusions. 
 He himself is compelled to admit in the passage we have quoted that Marx blended his philosophy and politicaleconomy into an integral materialist world outlook, and that Marx’s general philosophical conception is the broadest ! This is no trifling admission. 
 A person who is compelled to make such an admission and who talks about a critical revision of political economy and about its new methodolog-ical tasks, is in duty bound seriously to examine all the components of Marx’s “integral” materialist world outlook. 
But Mr. 
 Struve does not even attempt to do that. 
 He con-fines himself to a few slighting remarks against “metaphysicalmaterialism”. 
 Who does not know that, from the point of view of the fashionable theories of agnosticism (Kantianism, positivism, Machism, and so forth), both consistent mate-rialism and consistent philosophical idealism are “meta-physics”? In making remarks of this kind, Mr. 
 Struve merelyhints at his own philosophical world outlook, which has nothing integral about it. 
 But the task of examining and studying Marx’s integral materialist world outlook cannot be dismissed with remarks of this kind. 
 To attempt to doso is merely to issue oneself with a testimonium pauper-tatis . 
 III On the other hand, the attempt to identify Marxism with the scholastic doctrine of original sin is such a gem in Mr. 
Struve’s scientific treatise that we cannot refrain from examining it in greater detail. 
 We ask our readers’ forgiven-ess in advance for quoting long passages, but one must be accurate here in order to pin down more firmly the methods used by modern liberal-professorial science. 
 “It is quite clear to me,” writes Mr. 
 Struve, “that many centuries ago Marx’s theory of labour worth, in its logicalstructure had its extremely close analogy and prototype inthe ‘realistically’ grounded scholastic doctrine of original sin.... 
 Just as according to Marx empirical ‘prices’ are gov-erned by the law of worth, and owe their existence to thesubstance of worth, so to speak, so, according to scholasti-cism, the empirical actions of men are determined by orig-inal sin. 
 “Here are some analogies. 
 “Marx : ‘The matter will be most readily pictured by regarding this whole mass of commodities, produced by onebranch of industry, as one commodity, and the sum of theprices of the many identical commodities as one price. 
Then, whatever has been said of a single commodity appliesliterally to the mass of commodities of an entire branch of production available in the market. 
 The requirement that the individual value of a commodity should correspondto its social value is now realised, or further determined,in that the mass contains social labour necessary for itsproduction, and that the value of this mass is equal to itsmarket value. 
’ 103 “Thomas Aquinas : ‘We must say that all men who are born of Adam may be regarded as one man, since they areidentical in the nature which they inherited from theirprogenitor, just as, for example, all men who live in onecounty are regarded as one body, and the whole county asone man’.... 
” Quite enough, is it not? Mr. 
 Struve assures us that this is “not playing at striking [!?] analogies or witticising”. 
Perhaps. 
 But it is undoubtedly playing at vulgar analogies,or rather, simply clowning. 
 If people who regard themselvesas liberal and progressive scholars are capable of toleratingsuch heroes of buffoonery in their midst; if these heroes are granted scientific degrees, and are allowed to instruct the young, then that only shows for the hundredth and thou-sandth time what the “law” of the bourgeois era is: the more insolently and shamelessly you make mock of science in the effort to demolish Marx, the greater is your merit. 
 Mr. 
 Struve had to resort to clownish antics in order to cover up his sheer inability to refute Marx. 
 That the wholemass of commodities of a given branch of industry isexchanged for the sum of commodities of another branch, isan indisputable fact. 
 That all “empiricists” determine averageprice by taking the whole mass of commodities and dividing the aggregate price by the number of individual commodi-ties, is also a fact. 
 Statistics, for which Mr. 
 Struve has sucha liking (and which, as we shall see below, he only “hints at”instead of trying to study), prove to us at every turn thatMarx’s method is constantly employed. 
 But what do pro-fessional “socialistophobes” care? The thing is to take a kick at Marx; all the rest will take care of itself. 
 The nature of the philosophical authorities who give Mr. 
 Struve their benediction in his noble occupation canbe seen, among other things, from the following wordsuttered by our professor: “In this work [that of summing-up the ideas of the nineteenth century] impartial posterity should assign a prominent place to thegreat French metaphysician Renouvier, to whom many of the critical and positive ideas of our times can be traced” (43). 
 Renouvier was the head of the French school of “neo-criti-cal idealism”, “an obscurantist of the first water”, as hewas called by the empirio-critic (i. 
e. 
, anti-materialist philosopher) Willy (see my remarks on Renouvier in Mate-rialism and Empirio-Criticism. 
 Critical Comments on aReactionary Philosophy . 
 Moscow, 1909, p. 
 247). 
 * Renouvier wrote the word “law” with a capital L and simply convertedit into a basis for religion. 
 See by what methods Mr. 
 Struve demolishes Marx’s “integral [as he himself admits] materialist world out-look”; he puts Marx on the same footing as a medievaltheologian on the sole grounds that Marx takes the aggregateprices of commodities of a single branch of production,while the medieval theologian, Thomas Aquinas, takes allmen who descend from the first man Adam, and uses this as a basis for his doctrine of original sin. 
 At the same time *See present edition, Vol. 
 14, p. 
 211. 
— Ed. 
 Marx is demolished in the name of the “great” Renouvier who preached philosophical idealism in the nineteenth century and used the concept of “law” as a basis for religion! O Mr. 
 Struve! O disciple of the “great” Renouvier! O teacher charged with the enlightenment of Russian youth! IV “In the vast reconstruction,” writes Mr. 
 Struve, “which the edifice of political economy, as based on the idea of natural law, underwentafter the onslaught of historism, both mystical and materialist, that idea was an utter failure. 
 Its basic inner contradiction manifested itself. 
 The latter revealed itself perhaps most glaringly in that formof ‘natural’ political economy which became the theoretical founda-tion of bourgeois economic liberalism.... 
 Indeed, if natural law reigns in economic life, there can be no facts in that life which are out ofharmony with natural law, or contradict it. 
 And yet liberal ‘natural’ political economy constantly fought, in books and in life, against such facts .... 
 A fter the bankruptcy of bourgeois liberal political econ-omy it became almost indecent to speak of ‘natural law’. 
 On the one hand, it was obviously unscientific to single out from an integral and, in principle, uniform social economic process certain individualaspects, relations and phenomena, as ‘natural’, and place them in a special category of phenomena. 
 On the other hand, the proclamation of ‘natural law’, which even in economic liberalism rested on anunconscious ethical motive, was ethically discredited because it was regarded as a method that justified or perpetuated certain social relations and forms that were only of temporary significance, becauseit was regarded as a ‘bourgeois’ apologia” (56-57). 
 This is how the author disposes of the idea of natural law. 
 And this has been written by a man who is compelledto admit that “the materialist Marx extended a hand to thematerialist Petty across the whole of the eighteenth century”(56), and that “Petty is the most striking and most out-standing exponent of the powerful current which at the time flowed from natural to social science” (50). 
 It is common knowledge that a powerful current flowed from natural to social science not only in Petty’s time,but in Marx’s time as well. 
 And this current remains just aspowerful, if not more so, in the twentieth century too. 
 Howcan one raise the question of this “current” and speak of the materialism of Petty and Marx in a work that claims to be scientific, and is meant to study “the philosophical motives of economic thinking”, without saying anything whatever about the philosophical premises and deductions of natural science? But that is precisely Mr. 
 Struve’s manner: to raise, or rather, touch upon, a thousand and one questions, to “holdforth” on everything, to present everything as being weighedand considered, but to give nothing except a hash of quota-tions and running comments. 
 It is a downright falsehood to say that the idea of natural law is bankrupt in political economy, and that it is “indecentto speak of it”. 
 On the contrary. 
 It is the “current from natu-ral to social science” that has been reinforcing this idea andmade it inevitable. 
 It is “materialist historism” that conclu-sively substantiated this idea, after stripping it of its meta-physical (in the Marxist sense of this term, i. 
e. 
, anti-dia-lectical) absurdities and defects. 
 To say that the “natural law”of the classics is “ethically discredited” as being a bourgeoisapologia, is sheer nonsense. 
 It means distorting both theclassics and “materialist historism” in the most flagrantmanner. 
 For the classics sought and discovered a number of capitalism’s “natural laws”, but they failed to understand its transitory character, failed to perceive the class strugglewithin it. 
 Both these faults were remedied by material-ist historism and “ethical derogation” has nothing to dowith it. 
 By employing exaggeratedly “strong” language (“indecent” to speak about “natural law”), Mr. 
 Struve is trying in vain to conceal his dread of science, a dread of scientific analysis of the modern economy, so characteristic of the bourgeoisie. 
Lordly scepticism is characteristic of them, as it is ofall declining classes, but the idea of a natural law governingthe functioning and development of society is not declining, but is steadily gaining ground. 
 V We shall now examine the “strictly evolved, precise concepts and clear distinctions” which Mr. 
 Struve promised to provide for the “formulation of new methodologicalproblems” of political economy. 
 /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR “We define economy” we read on page 5, “as the subjective teleo-logical entity of rational economic activity or economic management. 
” This sounds “awfully learned”, but it is really a mere juggling with words. 
 Economy is defined as economic manage-ment! A statement of the obvious .... 
 The “subjective entity of economic management” may be found in dreamsand fantastic novels. 
 Afraid to say the production of material products (“meta-physical materialism”!), Mr. 
 Struve gives us a gewgaw, not a definition. 
 By eliminating every element and symptom ofsocial relationships, Mr. 
 Struve has “invented”, as if onpurpose, an “economy” that political economy has never studied, and can never study. 
 Here are the “three main types of economic systems” that he then goes on to enumerate: 1) the sum total of parallel economic units; 2) the system of interacting economies,and 3) “community-economy” as the “subjective teleologicalentity”. 
 The first type covers, if you please, economies thatare not interlinked and do not interact (an attempt to reviveRobinson Crusoe!); the second refers to slavery, serfdom, capitalism, and simple commodity production; the third refers to communism, “which was practised in the Jesuitstate in Paraguay to the extent that it is at all practicable”. 
This masterly classification, in which no trace of historicalreality is discernible, is supplemented by the distinctiondrawn between economic and social systems. 
 Economic categories, Mr. 
 Struve tells us edifyingly, “express the economic relation in which every subjectengaged in economy stands to the surrounding world”;inter-economic categories “express phenomena that spring from the interaction of the autonomous economies”; social categories “spring from the social inequality among interact-ing people engaged in economy”. 
 Thus, the economic system of slavery, serfdom and capi-talism may be logically, economically and historically de-tached from social inequality! This is what emerges fromMr. 
 Struve’s clumsy efforts to introduce new definitions anddistinctions. 
 “Arguing in the abstract, the sum total of parallel economic units is compatible with relations of equal-ity and inequality. 
 It may be a peasant democracy or afeudal society. 
” This is how our author reasons. 
 From the point of view of theory—logic, economics and history—his reasoning is utterly absurd. 
 By stretching the concept of the “sum total of parallel economic units” to cover almost everything, hereveals how meaningless that concept is. 
 Peasant democracy,feudalism, and proprietors living side by side (on one floor,on one landing, in a St. 
 Petersburg apartment house), areall the “sum total of parallel economic units”! The author has already forgotten that, in his system, this sum total is sup-posed to characterise one of the three main types of economic systems. 
 Mr. 
 Struve’s “scientific” definitions and distinctionsare mere gibberish. 
 This crude and trivial quibbling, however, this flouting of logic and history has a “meaning” of its own. 
 That “meaning” is bourgeois despair and “don’t-care-a-damn attitude” (if one can thus translate the French expression“je m’en fiche ”). 
 Despair of ever being able to give a scien-tific analysis of the present, a denial of science, a tendency todespise all generalisations, to hide from all the “laws” of histor-ical development, and make the trees screen the wood — such is the class idea underlying the fashionable bourgeois scepticism, the dead and deadening scholasticism, which wefind in Mr. 
 Struve’s book. 
 “Social inequality” should not be attributed to the economic system; it is impossible to do that (because the bourgeoisie does not wish it)—thatis Mr. 
 Struve’s “theory”. 
 Let political economy indulge in truisms, scholastics and the senseless pursuit of triv-ial facts (examples of which will be found below), andlet the question of “social inequalities” recede into the safersphere of sociological and legal arguments. 
 These unpleasantquestions can more easily be “ducked” in that sphere. 
 Economic reality glaringly reveals the class division of society as the basis of the economic system of both capital-ism and feudalism. 
 From the moment political economymade its appearance, science has concentrated its attentionon explaining this class division. 
 Classical political economy took a number of steps along this road, and Marx took astep further. 
 Today’s bourgeoisie is so scared by this step, so disturbed by the “laws” of modern economic evolution, which are all too obvious and too formidable, that thebourgeois and their ideologists are prepared to throw all the classics and all the laws overboard, so long as they can relegate all these social inequalities, or whatever you call them ... to the archives of jurisprudence. 
 VI Mr. 
 Struve would particularly like to relegate the concept of value to the archives. 
 “Worth,” he writes, “as something distinct from price, independent of it and yet determining it, is a phantom” (96). 
 “The category of objective worth ismerely, so to speak, the metaphysical doubling of the cate-gory of price” (97). 
 To demolish socialism, Mr. 
 Struve has chosen the most ... radical, the easiest, and at the same time the most flimsy method, that of repudiating science altogether. 
 Here the lordly scepticism of the blasé and frightened bourgeois reaches its nec plus ultra . 
 Like the advocate in Dostoyevsky’s novel who, in defending his client charged with murder forthe purpose of robbery, went to the length of saying thatthere had been neither robbery nor murder; Mr. 
 Struve “refutes” Marx’s theory of value simply by asserting that value is a phantom. 
 “At present it is no longer necessary to refute it [the theory of objective value]; it need only be described in the way we have donehere and in our ‘Introduction’ to show that it does not and cannotexist in scientific theory” (97). 
 Now how can one help calling this most “radical” method most flimsy? For thousands of years mankind has beenaware of the operation of an objective law in the phenomenonof exchange, has been trying to understand it and express it with the utmost precision, has been testing its explana-tions by millions and billions of day-by-day observationsof economic life; and suddenly, a fashionable representativeof a fashionable occupation—that of collecting quotations(I almost said collecting postage stamps)—comes along and“does away with all this”: “worth is a phantom”. 
 Not for nothing has it been said that were the truths of mathematics to affect the interests of men (or rather, theinterests of classes in their struggle), those truths would beheatedly challenged. 
 No great brains are needed to challengethe incontestible truths of economic science. 
 Just a word inserted about value being a phantom, something independ-ent of price —and the trick is done! It does not matter that such an insertion is ridiculous. 
 Price is a manifestation of the law of value. 
 Value is thelaw of price, i. 
e. 
, the generalised expression of the phenom-enon of price. 
 To speak of “independence” here is a mockeryof science, which in all fields of knowledge reveals the oper-ation of fundamental laws in a seeming chaos of phenomena. 
 Take, for example, the law of the variation of species and of the formation of higher species from lower ones. 
 Itwould be very cheap to designate as a phantom the gener-alisations of natural science, the already discovered laws(accepted by all despite the host of seeming contraventionsand deviations shown in the medley of individual cases), and the search for corrections and supplements to them. 
 In the field of natural science, anyone who said that the laws govern-ing phenomena in the natural world were phantoms wouldbe put into a lunatic asylum, or simply laughed out of court. 
In the field of economic science, however, a man who strutsabout ... stark naked ... is readily appointed professor, for he is really quite fitted to stultify the minds of the pampered sons of the bourgeoisie. 
 “Price is a fact. 
 We will put it this way: price is the concept of the real exchange relations between wealth in the process of exchange;it is a realised exchange relation. 
 “Worth is a norm. 
 We will put it this way: worth is the concept of the ideal, or what ought to be the interrelation between wealth in the process of exchange” (88). 
 How characteristic of Mr. 
 Struve is this negligent, ostenta-tiously off-hand remark: “We will put it this way”. 
 Deliber-ately ponderous, and, juggling with abstruse terms andnew-fangled formulations, Mr. 
 Struve suddenly adopts thefeuilleton tone .... 
 Indeed, it would be difficult to proclaim value a phantom without adopting a feuilleton tone. 
 If price is a “realised exchange relation”, then it may be asked: relation between what? Obviously, between theeconomic units engaged in the process of exchange. 
 If this“exchange relation” does not arise accidentally, as an iso-lated case and for a brief period, but repeats itself with invariable regularity, everywhere, and every day, then it is obvious that this “exchange relation” links the sum total of economic units in a single economic system ; obviously, there is a firmly established division of labour between these economic units. 
 Thus, all Mr. 
 Struve’s wily reasoning about “inter-eco-nomic” relations, which are alleged to be separable from social relations, are already collapsing like a house of cards. 
 Mr. 
 Struve has driven the concept of commodity pro-duction out of the door only to let it steal in through the window. 
 Mr. 
 Struve’s famous “empiricism” consists in expel-ling from science generalisations that are unpleasant to thebourgeoisie, but which nevertheless have to be recognisedunofficially, so to speak. 
 If price is an exchange relation, then one must inevitably understand the difference between an individual exchange relation and a constant one, between an accidental and mass relation, between a momentary relation and one thatembraces a long period of time. 
 If that is the case—andit certainly is—we must as inevitably work upward fromthe accidental and the individual to the constant and wide-spread: from price to value. 
 Mr. 
 Struve’s attempts to pro-claim value as something which “should be”, to identify it with ethics, or with the doctrine of the canonists, and soforth, collapse like a house of cards. 
 By saying that the recognition of value as a phantom is “empiricism” and that the striving (which can be traced“from Aristotle” to Marx—p. 
 91—and it should be added: through the whole of classical political economy!)—the striving to discover the law of the formation of and change in prices is “metaphysics”, Mr. 
 Struve repeats the method ofthe latest philosophical reactionaries, who by “metaphysics”mean the materialism of natural science in general, and by“empiricism” mean taking a step towards religion. 
 Expelling laws from science means, in fact, smuggling in the laws of religion . 
 In vain does Mr. 
 Struve imagine that his “little strat-agems” can deceive anybody with reference to this simpleand undoubted fact. 
 VII As we have seen, Mr. 
 Struve has evaded a pitched battle with the Marxists and taken shelter behind scepticism ingeneral. 
 But he has made up for this by the zeal with which he has scattered remarks against Marxism throughout his book, in the hope of catching his readers after they have been stunned by the mass of random and disjointed quotations flung at them. 
 For example, he quotes a brief passage from Saint-Simon, mentions a series of books on Saint-Simon (this copyingfrom German bibliographies is systematically practised byour “scholar”, evidently as the surest road ... to a scien-tific degree), and quotes lengthy passages from Renouvier about Saint-Simon. 
 What is the conclusion to be drawn from this?It is the following: ”Paradoxical as it may seem, it is simply an incontrovertible historical fact that the higherform of socialism, so-called scientific socialism, is the offspring of the liaison between revolutionary and reactionary thought” (51-52). 
 For the path to scien-tific socialism can be traced through Saint-Simon, and“Saint-Simon was a disciple of both eighteenth centuryEnlightenment, and of the reactionaries of the late eighteenthand early nineteenth centuries” (53). 
 “This should always be borne in mind: historical materialism is essentially the product of the reaction against the spirit of the eighteenthcentury. 
 First, it is the reaction of the organic view againstrationalism; secondly, it is the reaction of economism againstpoliticism. 
 Moreover, in his religious period, Saint-Simonrepresented the reaction of emotion and religion against the ideas of law and human justice” (54-55). 
 To seal this, Mr. 
 Struve repeats: “Marxism is the formula of the Frenchtheocratical school, and of the historical counter-revolution-ary reaction in general, translated into the language ofpositivism, atheism and radicalism. 
 Dismissing reason,Marx remained a revolutionary and a socialist” (55) .... 
 If Marx succeeded in assimilating and further developing, on the one hand, “the spirit of the eighteenth century” inits struggle against the feudal and clerical powers of theMiddle Ages, and on the other hand, the economism andhistorism (and also the dialectics) of the philosophers andhistorians of the early nineteenth century, it only proves the depth and power of Marxism, and only confirms the opinions of those who regard Marxism as the last word in science. 
 With a clarity that left no room for misunderstanding Marx always pointed out that the doctrines of the reaction-aries—historians and philosophers—contained profound ideas about the operation of definite laws and the class struggle in the march of political events. 
 But Mr. 
 Struve performs capers and declares that Marx-ism is the offspring of reaction, although he immediatelyadds that Marxism can be traced, not to Saint-Simon the clericalist , but to Saint-Simon the historian and econo-mist! It appears that, by means of a catch-phrase, and with-out saying a single serious word about the contribution made by Saint-Simon to social science after the Enlight-enment of the eighteenth century and before Marx, our author has leaped over the whole of social science in general. 
 Inasmuch as this science was built up, first, by the classi-cal economists, who discovered the law of value and thefundamental division of society into classes; inasmuch as important contributions to this science were made, in con-junction with the classical economists, by the Enlight-enment of the eighteenth century in its struggle against feu-dalism and clericalism; inasmuch as this science was pro-moted by the historians and philosophers of the early nine-teenth century who, notwithstanding their reactionaryviews, still further explained the class struggle, developedthe dialectical method and applied it, or began to apply it,in social life—Marxism, which made tremendous advances along precisely this path, marks the highest development of Europe’s entire historical, economic and philosophicalscience. 
 Such is the logical deduction. 
 But Mr. 
 Struve’sdeduction says: Marxism is therefore not worth refuting, the laws of value, and so forth, are not even worth dis-cussing, and Marxism is the offspring of reaction! Does Mr. 
 Struve really think that he can deceive his readers and disguise his obscurantism with such crudemethods? VIII Obviously, Mr. 
 Struve’s scientific treatise would not have been a scientific treatise submitted for a scientific degree if it did not set out to “prove” that socialism is im-practicable. 
 Perhaps you think this is going too far? Is it possible, in a work dealing with the question of price and economy as well as “certain philosophical motives” of political economy, to “prove” that socialism is impracticable without evenattempting to study the historical tendencies of capitalism? Oh, for Mr. 
 Struve there is nothing easier! Listen:“In the final analysis, economic liberalism envisages complete identity—on the basis of the operation of ‘natural law’—between the rational and what ought to be, and the natural and necessary in the socio-economic process, itscomplete rationalisation .... 
 Socialism, in its most perfect form of historical, or what is called scientific socialism,while rejecting ‘natural law’, at the same time acceptsthis fundamental idea of economic liberalism. 
 It also as-sumes that harmony is possible between a rational structure and the natural course of things, and that the completerationalisation of the socio-economic process is possible”(p. 
 58). 
 Then come a few off-hand phrases about this“belief” (p. 
 59) and the following ponderous scientific de-duction (p. 
 60). 
 (Paragraph 7, Chapter 2, Section I of Part I of Mr. 
 Struve’s “work”): “Comparing the socialist and liberal ideal with the world of reality, scientifically empirical research must admitthat the belief contained in these ideals is groundless. 
In the formal sense, both these ideals are equally im-practicable, equally utopian. 
” When reading things like this, one can scarcely believe the evidence of one’s eyes. 
 What a degree of senile decayand prostitution has been reached by present-day profes-sorial science! Mr. 
 Struve knows perfectly well that scien-tific socialism is based on the fact of capitalism’s socialisationof production. 
 This fact is borne out by a host of phenomena to be observed all over the world. 
 And there is a wealth of “empirical” evidence pointing to the degree and rapiditywith which these phenomena are developing. 
 But our scholar, who evades the question of the socialisa-tion of production and does not touch upon a single sphere of these innumerable facts in his “scientifically empirical research”, declares, on the basis of a few meaningless phrases about liberalism and rationalisation, that the questionis scientifically solved! It is not true to say that liberalism envisages complete rationalisation. 
 It is not true to say that Marxism repudi-ates “natural law”. 
 The entire phrase, “complete rationali-sation”, is false and meaningless; it is all a shoddy evasion,a stupid game in pursuit of a single purpose: to evade anissue that has been clearly and precisely formulated byscientific socialism; to stun young students with claptrapabout socialism being impracticable. 
 IX The bulk of Mr. 
 Struve’s treatise, much more than a half, is devoted to “sketches and materials on the historicalphenomenology of price”. 
 This is where our ardent advocate of “consistent empiri-cism”, who declares value to be a phantom and has studiedprices as facts, can really show his mettle! Price statistics in the last few years have made great ad-vances. 
 An enormous amount of material has been collectedin all countries. 
 Quite a few books have been published on the history of prices. 
 If our strict scholar does not even condescend to refute Marx’s theory of value, why could henot at least analyse some of the fundamental problems ofthis theory with the aid of the “empirical” material furnishedby the history and statistics of prices? Thousands ofcommodities and hundreds of sections or periods of the history of their prices can be found, where the influence of all extraneous factors can be eliminated—with the excep-tion of the labour “ factor ”—and where precise data is avail-able on the amount of labour consumed in the productionof a given commodity. 
 Why could not our advocate of “con-sistent empiricism”, in a work of “scientific research” on prices, even touch upon these data in the section dealing with the “historical phenomenology of price”? Why? Obviously because Mr. 
 Struve was only too well aware of the hopelessness of his case, of the impossibilityof refuting the theory of objective, labour value, and instinc-tively felt that he must steer clear of all scientific research. 
 The hundreds of pages of Mr. 
 Struve’s treatise devoted to “sketches and materials on the historical phenomenologyof price” are an exceptionally remarkable illustration of how present-day bourgeois scientists steer clear of science. 
 What will you not find in these pages! Comments on fixed and free prices; several observations on the Polynesians; excerpts from the market regulations issued by (ah, whaterudition!) King Andrianampoinimerina, unifier of Mada-gascar, in 178?-1810; several clauses of the Code of Hammu-rabi, King of Babylon (about 2100 B. 
 C. 
) concerning a sur-geon’s fee for performing an operation; several passages, mostly in Latin and highly scholarly, concerning the sched-uling of the purchase price of women in ancient Germancodes; the translation of seven passages referring to commer-cial law from the works of the holy lawgivers of India,Manu and Yajna Valmiki *; the protection of purchasers in Roman law, and so on and, so forth, right up to Hellenic examples of the police regulation of prices in Rome and the Christianisation of Roman police law in the legislation ofthe Carolings. 
 We may expect that Mr. 
 V. 
 P. 
 Ryabushinsky, who pub-lished Mr. 
 Struve’s treatise, will immortalise his own fameas a patron and the fame of Mr. 
 Struve as a serious scholar, by publishing another hundred or so of volumes of sketches and materials on the historical methodology of prices de-scribing, let us say, the bazaars of all times and all nations,with illustrations in the text and with comments by Mr. 
Struve wrenched from the best German bibliographies. 
 Con-sistent empiricism will triumph, while the phantoms of various “laws” of political economy will vanish like smoke. 
 X In the old pre-revolutionary Russia, scholars and scien-tists were divided into two big camps: those who made up to the government, and those who were independent; by the former were meant hired hacks and those who wrote toorder. 
 This crude division, which corresponded to patriarchal, semi-Asiatic relations, is undoubtedly now obsolete and *Mr. 
 S. 
 F. 
 Oldenburg, politely replying to Mr. 
 Struve’s enquiry writes that “the law books on the questions that you [Mr. 
 Struve]touch upon evidently closely reflect actual life”. 
 (Footnote 51b, §8, Subsection II, Chapter 2, Section II, Part I of Mr. 
 Struve’s work. 
) should be relegated to the archives. 
 Russia is rapidly be-coming Europeanised. 
 Our bourgeoisie is almost quite mature, and in some ways overripe. 
 Its scholars and scien-tists are “independent” of the government; they are incapableof writing to order; they earnestly and conscientiously studyproblems from a point of view and by methods which theysincerely and conscientiously believe to coincide with theinterests of “captains” of our commerce and industry like Mr. 
 V. 
 P. 
 Ryabushinsky. 
 To earn the reputation of a serious scientist or scholar and to obtain official recognition ofone’s works in our times, when such advances have beenmade in everything, one must prove with the aid of a coupleof “Kantian-style” definitions that socialism is impracti-cable; one must demolish Marxism by explaining to one’s readers and listeners that it is not worth refuting, and by quoting a thousand names and titles of books by Europeanprofessors; one must throw by the board all scientific lawsin general, to make room for religious laws; one must pileup a mountain of highly scientific lumber and rubbish withwhich to stuff the heads of young students. 
 It does not matter if the result is far more crude than that coming from the bourgeois scientists and scholars ofGermany. 
 The important thing is that Russia, after all,has definitely taken the path of Europeanisation. 
 FORM S OF THE WORKIN G-CLAS S MOVEMEN T104 (THE LOCKOUT AND IST TACTICS) Lockouts, i. 
e. 
, the mass discharge of workers by common agreement among employers, is as necessary and inevitable a phenomenon in capitalist society as strikes are. 
 Capital, which throws the whole of its crushing weight upon the ruined small producers and the proletariat, constantly threatensto force the conditions of the workers down to starvation leveland condemn them to death from starvation. 
 And in allcountries there have been cases, even whole periods in thelife of nations, when the failure of the workers to fight back has led to their being reduced to incredible poverty and all the horrors of starvation. 
 The workers’ resistance springs from their very condi-tions of life—the sale of labour-power. 
 Only as a resultof this resistance, despite the tremendous sacrifices theworkers have to make in the struggle, are they able to main-tain anything like a tolerable standard of living. 
 But capital is becoming more and more concentrated, manufacturers’associations are growing, the number of destitute andunemployed people is increasing, and so also is want amongthe proletariat; consequently, it is becoming harder thanever to fight for a decent standard of living. 
 The cost of living, which has been rising rapidly in recent years, often nullifies all the workers’ efforts. 
 By drawing larger and larger masses of the proletariat into the organised struggle, the workers’ organisations, andfirst and foremost the trade unions, make the workers’resistance more planned and systematic. 
 With the existence of mass trade unions of different types, strikes become more stubborn: they occur less often, but each conflict is ofbigger dimensions. 
 Lockouts are caused by a sharpening of the struggle, and in their turn, sharpen that struggle. 
 Rallying in the struggle and developing its class-consciousness, its organisation and experience in that struggle, the prole-tariat becomes more and more firmly convinced that thecomplete economic reconstruction of capitalist society isessential. 
 Marxist tactics consist in combining the different forms of struggle, in the skilful transition from one form to anoth-er, in steadily enhancing the consciousness of the massesand extending the area of their collective actions, each ofwhich, taken separately, may be aggressive or defensive,and all of which, taken together, lead to a more intenseand decisive conflict. 
 Russia lacks the fundamental conditions for such a devel-opment of the struggle as we see in the West-Europeancountries, namely, a struggle waged through the mediumof firmly established and systematically developing tradeunions. 
 Unlike Europe, which has enjoyed political freedom for a long time, the strike movement in Russia in 1912-14 extended beyond the narrow trade union limits. 
 The liberals denied this, while the liberal-labour politicians (liquidators) failedto understand it, or shut their eyes to it. 
 But the fact com-pelled them to admit it. 
 In Milyukov’s Duma speech duringthe interpellation on the Lena events, this forced , belated, half-hearted, platonic (i. 
e. 
, accompanied, not by effective assistance, but only by sighs) admission of the general significance of the working-class movement was quitedefinite. 
 By their liberal talk about the “strike craze” andtheir opposition to combining economic and other motives in the strike movement (we would remind our readers that Messrs. 
 Yezhov and Co. 
 began to talk in this fashion in 1912!) the liquidators aroused the legitimate disgust of theworkers. 
 That is why the workers firmly and deliberatelyhad the liquidators “removed from office” in the working-class movement. 
 The Marxists’ attitude towards the strike movement caused no wavering or dissatisfaction among the workers. 
 Moreover, the significance of lockouts was formally andofficially appraised by the organised Marxists as far back as February 1913105 (true, in an arena which the liquida-tors, those slaves of the liberals, do not see). 
 Already in February 1913 the formal decision of the Marxists definitely and clearly spoke of lockouts and the necessity of taking them into account in our tactics. 
 How are they to be taken into account? By going more carefully into the expediencyof any given action, by changing the form of struggle,substituting (it was precisely substitution that was pro-posed!) one form for another, the general tendency being to rise to higher forms. 
 The class-conscious workers are well acquainted with certain concrete cases when the movementrose to higher forms which were historically subjected torepeated test, and which are “unintelligible” and “alien”only to the liquidators. 
 On March 21, immediately after the lockout was declared, the Pravdists issued their clear-cut slogan: Do not let the employers choose for us the time and form of action; do not goon strike now! The labour unions and the organised Marxistsknew and saw that this slogan was their own , drawn up by that same majority of the advanced proletariat which had secured the election of its representatives to the Insurance Board, 106 and which is guiding all the activities of the St. 
 Petersburg workers in the face of the disruptive and liberal outcries of the liquidators. 
 The slogan of March 21—do not go on strike now—was the slogan of the workers, who knew that they would be able to substitute one form for another, that they were striving and would continue to strive—through the constantlychanging forms of the movement—for a general rise to ahigher level. 
 The workers knew that the disrupters of the working-class movement—the liquidators and the Narodniks—would try to disrupt the workers’ cause in this case, too, and they were prepared in advance to offer resistance. 
 On March 26, both the liquidator and Narodnik groups of disrupters and violators of the will of the majority of the class-conscious workers of St. 
 Petersburg and of Russia,published in their newspapers the bourgeois banalities that are common to these camps. 
 The Narodniks (to the delight of the liquidators) chattered about “thoughtlessness” (theclass-conscious workers have long been aware that nobody is so thoughtless as the Narodniks), while the liquidators delivered liberal speeches (already analysed and condemned in Put Pravdy No. 
 47) and urged that instead of strikes the workers should resort to ... no, not the correspondinghigher forms, but to ... petitions and “resolutions”! Brushing aside this shameful liberal advice of the liqui-dators, and brushing aside the thoughtless chatter of theNarodniks, the advanced workers firmly proceeded along their own road. 
 The old decision, which called, in certain cases of lock-outs, for strikes to be superseded by certain higher forms of struggle corresponding to them, was well known to theworkers and correctly applied by them. 
 The employers failed to achieve the provocative purpose of their lockout. 
 The workers did not accept battle on the ground chosen by their enemies; in due time, the workersapplied the decision of the organised Marxists and, withgreater energy and more demonstratively, conscious of theimportance of their movement, continue to march along theold road. 
 Put Pravdy No. 
 54, Published according to April 4, 1914 the text in Put Pravdy THE LEFT NARODNIKS WHITEWASH THE BOURGEOISIE As soon as the Left-Narodnik gentry pass from empty and general phrases about the “labouring peasantry”— phrases that have been worked to death and reveal ignorance of both The Communist Manifesto and of Capital —to precise figures , we immediately see how the Left Narodniks white-wash the bourgeoisie. 
 The bourgeois character of the entire “labouring peasantry” theory is disguised behind catch-phrases and exclamations, but it is exposed by facts and by a study of Marx’s theory. 
 Thus, in Stoikaya Mysl No. 
 14, a certain Mr. 
 Batrak ,107 who writes in an extremely highbrow style, discusses “social-ism and the peasantry”. 
 “The number of labour economies is growing ,” Mr. 
 Batrak declares, and goes on to quote French and German statis-tics. 
 Statistics are not the sort of thing that can be dis-missed with catch-phrases or exclamations, and deception is very quickly exposed. 
 In France, the total area of “small farms”, i. 
e. 
, those of five to ten hectares (a hectare is slightly less than a dessiatine) has increased. 
 Very good, Mr. 
 Batrak! But have you not heard that the more intensive farming is, the more often one meets withthe employment of wage-labour on “ small ” (in area) farms? Does not this hushing up of the facts about the employmentof wage-labour mean whitewashing the bourgeoisie, Mr. 
Batrak? Let us take the German figures. 
 Out of 652,798 farms of five to ten hectares, 487,704 employ hired labourers . 
 What do you say to that? Most small farmers exploit wage-workers! And in France? In France, vinegrowing, which entails the employment of wage-labour on small holdings, is far more widespread than in Germany The “labour economy” theory is one that deceives the workers by hushing up the facts about the employment ofwage-labour. 
 Mr. 
 Batrak takes Germany. 
 The “small and medium” farms go as “labour” economies (the tongue is so flexible itcan call anybody a “labouring” farmer!). 
 And so, from the fact that the number of “small” and “medium” farms is growing Mr. 
 Batrak infers that the number of “labour” economiesis growing. 
 But consider the figures quoted by this new champion of the bourgeoisie. 
 He starts with farms of up to two hectares. 
 They con-stituted 58. 
3 per cent in 1882, 58. 
22 per cent in 1895 and 58. 
89 per cent in 1907. 
 An increase, is it not? But our “Left Narodnik” has hushed up the fact that this is an increase in the number of wage-workers ! The figures he distorts state definitely that of the 3,378,509 farmers who own farms of up to two hectares (1907), only 474,915, i. 
e. 
, a little over /FL00E1h (one-tenth), are inde-pendent farmers whose chief occupation is agriculture. 
 Most of them are wage-labourers (1,822,792). 
 Of the 3,378,509 farms, 2,920,119, i. 
e. 
, the vast major-ity, are subsidiary undertakings where farming does not provide the main earnings. 
 One may ask: Is not passing off farm-hands and day-labourers , wage-workers, as “labouring farmers” a white-washing of the bourgeoisie and capitalism? Does not the silly catch-phrase of “labouring farmers” serve here to conceal the gulf between the proletariat (the wage-workers) and the bourgeoisie? Does not this catch-phrase serve as a means of putting over bourgeois theories? To proceed. 
 Farms from two to five hectares. 
 These con-stituted 18. 
60 per cent in 1882, 18. 
29 per cent in 1895and 17. 
57 per cent in 1907. 
 This is what Mr. 
 Batrak writes. 
 What is his deduction? On that point he is silent . 
 The deduction is: a decrease , not growth. 
 It is precisely in this group of farms, and only in this group, that employers of labour (people who buy the labour of private individuals) and those who hire themselves out do not quite preponderate. 
 The number of farmers who hire labour is 411,311 (counting the number of hired labourers) while the number of those who hire themselves out is 104,251 (the latter is not thetotal number; here the statistics are incomplete). 
 Together,we get a total of 515,000, and the total number of thesepeasant farms is 1,006,277, so that even here more thanhalf either hire themselves out or employ labourers! The nice little catch-phrase of “labour economy serves to deceive the workers by withholding the facts about the buying and selling of labour-power . 
 Mr. 
 Batrak then takes farms of five to twenty hectares, and shows that their number is increasing. 
 But what about the employment of wage-labour? Not a word, not a sound about that. 
 The theoreticians of labour economy” have been commissioned by the bourgeoisie toconceal the figures about the employment of wage-labour. 
 We shall take these figures: 652,798 farms (1907) of five to ten hectares employ 487,704 wage-labourers, i. 
e. 
, morethan half exploit wage-labour. 
 A total of 412,741 farms of ten to twenty hectares employ 711,867 wage-labourers, i. 
e. 
, all, or nearly all , exploit wage-labour . 
 What should we call a man who poses as a “socialist” and yet classifies exploiters of wage-labour as “labouring farmers”? As the Marxists have more than once explained, the Left Narodniks are petty bourgeois, who whitewash the bourgeoi-sie and obscure the fact that it exploits wage-labour. 
 We shall return to the bourgeois theories of the Left Narodniks, and particularly to Mr. 
 Batrak’s theories, on afuture occasion. 
 At present we shall briefly sum up. 
 The “labour economy” theory is a bourgeois deception of the workers, based, among other things, on the concealment of the figures concerning the buying and selling of labour-power. 
 As a matter of fact, the vast majority of the “small and medium” peasants to whom the Left Narodniks are fond ofreferring without discrimination, either sell or buy labour-power, either hire themselves out or hire labour. 
 That is the crux of the matter , which the bourgeois “labour economy” theory obscures. 
 The proletarian says to the small peasant: you are a semi-proletarian, so follow the lead of the workers; it is your only salvation. 
 The bourgeois says to the small peasant: you are a small proprietor, a “labouring farmer”. 
 Labour economy “grows”under capitalism as well. 
 You should be with the proprie-tors, not with the proletariat. 
 The small proprietor has two souls: one is a proletarian and the other a “proprietory” soul. 
 The Left Narodniks are, in effect ; repeating the theories of the bourgeoisie and corrupting the small peasants with “proprietory” illusions. 
 That is why the Marxists re-lentlessly combat this bourgeois corruption of the smallpeasants (and backward workers) by the Left Narodniks. 
 Put Pravdy No. 
 56, Published according to April 6, 1914 the text in Put Pravdy ON THE QUESTIO N OF NATIONA L POLIC Y108 I wish to deal with our government’s policy on the nation-al question. 
 This is one of the most important of the ques-tions that come within the jurisdiction of our Ministry ofthe Interior. 
 Since the time the Duma last discussed theestimates of this Ministry, our ruling classes have been bringing the national question in Russia into the forefront and rendering it more and more acute. 
 The Beilis case attracted the repeated attention of the whole civilised world to Russia and exposed the disgracefulstate of affairs in this country. 
 There is not a vestige of legal-ity in Russia. 
 The Administration and the police are given a free hand in their wanton and shameless persecution of the Jews, even to the extent of covering up and condoningcrimes. 
 This precisely was the upshot of the Beilis case,which revealed the closest and most intimate connection .... 
 * To show that I am not exaggerating when I speak of the pogrom atmosphere Russia is breathing, I can quote the evidence of that most “reliable”, most conservative writer, Prince Meshchersky, the “minister-maker”. 
 Here is theopinion of “a Russian from Kiev”, published in PrinceMeshchersky’s journal, Grazhdanin . 
 109 “The atmosphere in which we are living is suffocating; wherever you go there is whispering, plotting; everywhere there is blood lust, everywhere the stench of the informer, everywhere hatred, everywhere mutterings, everywhere groans.... 
” * the political atmosphere which Russia is breathing. 
 To talk or think about law, legality, a constitution, and similarliberal naïveties in such an atmosphere is simply ridiculous,or rather, it would be ridiculous, were it not so ... serious! *The next page of this manuscript is missing. 
— Ed. 
 This atmosphere is felt day in day out by every person in the country who is at all intelligent and observant. 
 But not everyone has the courage to admit the significance of this pogrom atmosphere. 
 Why does such an atmosphere reignin our country? Why is it able to reign? Only because the country is actually in a state of scarcely concealed civil war . 
 Some find it very unpleasant to admit this truth; they wouldput a cloak over it. 
 Our liberals, both the Progressists 110 and the Cadets, are particularly fond of stitching such acloak out of patches of almost quite “constitutional” theo-ries. 
 But I permit myself to consider that there is nothingmore harmful, nothing more criminal than for representa-tives of the people to spread edifying deception from therostrum of the Duma. 
 The government’s entire policy towards the Jews and other “subject peoples”—pardon me for using this “government”expression—will at once become clear, natural and inevi-table if we face the truth and admit the undoubted fact thatthe country is in a state of scarcely concealed civil war. 
 Thegovernment is not ruling, but is waging war. 
 It chooses “genuinely Russian”, pogrom methods of warfare because it has no others at its disposal . 
 Everybody defends himself the best he can. 
 Purishkevich and his friendscannot defend themselves otherwise than by pursuing a“pogrom” policy; for they have no other means. 
 It is no use sighing; it is absurd to try to make shift with talk about a constitution, or law, or the system of administration; here it is simply a matter of the class interests of Purishke-vich and Co. 
, a matter of the difficult position this classis in. 
 Either settle accounts with this class resolutely and not merely in word, or else admit that the “pogrom” atmosphere is inevitable and inescapable in the entire policy of Russia. 
 Either resign yourselves to this policy, or else support thepopular, mass, and, in the first place, the proletarian move-ment against it. 
 These are the only alternatives. 
 There can beno middle course here. 
 In Russia, even according to official, i. 
e. 
, palpably exaggerated statistics, which are faked to suit the “govern-ment’s plans”, the Great Russians constitute no more than43 per cent of the entire population of the country. 
 The Great Russians in Russia constitute less than half the popu-lation. 
 Officially, according to Stolypin “ himself ”, even the Little Russians, or Ukrainians, are classed as a “ subject people ”. 
 Consequently, the “subject peoples” in Russia constitute 57 per cent of the population, i. 
e. 
, the majorityof the population, almost three-fifths, in all probabilityactually more than three-fifths. 
 In the Duma I representEkaterinoslav Gubernia, the overwhelming majority of whose population are Ukrainians. 
 The ban on the celebra-tions in honour of Shevchenko 111 was such an excellent, splendid, exceptionally happy and well-chosen measureas far as anti-government agitation is concerned, that nobetter agitation could be conceived. 
 I think that none ofour best Social-Democratic agitators against the govern-ment could ever have achieved such sensational success in so short a time as was achieved by this measure in rousingopposition to the government. 
 After this measure was taken,millions upon millions of ordinary people began to beconverted into public-minded citizens and were madeto see the truth of the saying that Russia is “a prison of nations”. 
 Our parties of the right and our nationalists are now clamouring so vehemently against the “Mazeppists” and ourfamous Bobrinsky is defending the Ukrainians from theoppression of the Austrian Government with such splendid, democratic zeal, that one would think he wanted to join the Austrian Social-Democratic Party. 
 But if by “Mazeppism” is meant gravitation towards Austria and preference for theAustrian political system, then perhaps Bobrinsky will notbe one of the least prominent of the “Mazeppists”, for he com-plains and rants about the oppression of the Ukrainians inAustria! Just think how hard it must be for a Russian Uk-rainian; for instance for an inhabitant of Ekaterino-slav Gubernia which I represent, to read or hear this! IfBobrinsky “himself”, if the nationalist Bobrinsky, if CountBobrinsky, if squire Bobrinsky, if factory owner Bobrinsky,if Bobrinsky who has links with the highest nobility (almostwith the “spheres”) thinks that the status of the national minorities is unjust and oppressive in Austria, where there is nothing like the disgraceful Jewish Pale of Settlement, orthe despicable practice of deporting Jews at the whim of despotic governors, or the prohibition of the native language in schools, then what should be said about the Ukrai-nians in Russia? What should be said about the other “subject peoples” in Russia? Do not Bobrinsky and the other nationalists, as well as the Rights, realise that they are bringing home to thesubject peoples” in Russia, that is, to three-fifths of thepopulation of Russia, the fact that Russia is a backward country even compared with Austria, which is the most backward of European countries? The whole point is that the position of Russia, which is governed by the Purishkeviches, or rather, groaning under-the heel of the Purishkeviches, is so peculiar that the utter-ances of the nationalist Bobrinsky admirably explain and foment Social-Democratic agitation. 
 Keep it up, noble factory owner and landlord Bobrinsky; you will certainly help us to arouse, enlighten and stir upboth the Austrian and the Russian Ukrainians! In Ekateri-noslav I heard several Ukrainians say that they wanted tosend Count Bobrinsky an address of thanks for his successful propaganda in favour of the Ukraine’s secession from Russia. 
 I was not surprised to hear this. 
 I saw propaganda leaflets,on one side of which was the Ukase banning the Shevchenkocelebrations while on the other side were excerpts fromBobrinsky’s eloquent speeches in favour of the Ukrainians.... 
 I advised sending these leaflets to Bobrinsky, Purishkevich and other Ministers. 
 But if Purishkevich and Bobrinsky are superlative agi-tators in favour of transforming Russia into a democraticrepublic, our liberals, including the Cadets, are trying toconceal from the people their agreement with the Purishke-viches on certain fundamental questions of national policy. 
 I would not be fulfilling my duty if, in speaking on the esti-mates of the Ministry of the Interior, which is pursuing anational policy everybody is aware of, I did not mentionthis agreement of the Constitutional-Democratic Party with the Ministry of the Interior’s principles. 
 Indeed, is it not clear that anybody who wishes to be putting it mildly—in “opposition” to the Ministry of the Interior must also know the ideological allies of this Min-istry in the Cadet camp. 
 According to a Rech report, the Constitutional-Democrat-ic Party, or the “party of people’s freedom”, held its regu-lar conference in St. 
 Petersburg on March 23 to 25 of this year. 
 “National questions,” says Rech (No. 
 83), “were discussed... in a most lively manner. 
 The deputies from Kiev, whowere supported by N. 
 V. 
 Nekrasov and A. 
 M. 
 Kolyubakin,stated that the national question was a maturing major factor which had to be met more firmly than it had been up to now. 
 But F. 
 F. 
 Kokoshkin said that both the pro-gramme and previous political experience called for verycareful handling of the ‘elastic formulas’ of political self-determination for ‘nationalities’. 
” This is Rech ’s version of the matter. 
 And although this version is deliberately worded to keep the greatest numbers of readers in the dark , the gist of the matter is nevertheless clear to every observant and thinking person. 
 Kievskaya Mysl , 112 which sympathises with the Cadets and voices their views, reports Kokoshkin’s speech with the additionof the following comment: “Because it may lead to the disintegration of the state. 
” This, undoubtedly, was the gist of Kokoshkin’s speech. 
 Among the Cadets, Kokoshkin’s point of view prevailedeven over the extremely timid democratism of the Nekra-sovs and Kolyubakins. 
 Kokoshkin’s point of view is thatof the Great-Russian liberal-bourgeois nationalist who defends the privileges of the Great Russian (although they are a minority in Russia), and defends them hand in hand with the Ministry of the Interior. 
 Kokoshkin “theoreti-cally” defended the policy of the Ministry of the Interior—that is the gist, the core, of the matter. 
 “More careful handling of political self-determination” of nations! Care must be taken that it does not “lead to the disintegration of the state”!—that is the substance of Kokoshkin’s national policy, which fully coincides with the main line of policy pursued by the Ministry of theInterior. 
 But Kokoshkin and the other Cadet leaders arenot infants. 
 They are perfectly familiar with the saying: “The Sabbath was made for man and not man for the sab-bath. 
” The state exists for the people, not the people forthe state. 
 Kokoshkin and the other Cadet leaders are not infants. 
 They know perfectly well that in our country the state is (in effect) the Purishkevich class. 
 The integrity of the state is the integrity of the Purishkevich class. 
 If one looks at the essence of their policy, stripped of its diplomatic trappings, one will realise what the Kokoshkins are con-cerned about. 
 For the sake of illustration I shall quote the following simple example. 
 In 1905, as you know, Norway seceded from Sweden in face of vehement protests from the Swedish landlords, who threatened to go to war against Norway. 
Fortunately, the feudalists in Sweden are not all-powerfulas they are in Russia, and there was no war. 
 Norway, witha minority of the population, seceded from Sweden in apeaceful, democratic, and civilised way, not in the way the feudalists and the militarist party wanted. 
 What happened? Did the people lose by it? Did the interests of civilisation orthe interests of democracy, or the interests of the workingclass, suffer as a result of this secession? Not in the least! Both Norway and Sweden are countries that are far more civilised than Russia is—incidentally, precisely because they succeeded in applying in a democrat-ic manner the formula of the “political self-determination”of nations. 
 The breaking of compulsory ties strengthened voluntary economic ties, strengthened cultural intimacy,and mutual respect between these two nations, which are soclose to each other in language and other things. 
 The common interests, the closeness of the Swedish and Norwegian peo-ples actually gained from the secession, for secession meant the rupture of compulsory ties. 
 I hope that this example has made it clear that Kokosh-kin and the Constitutional-Democratic Party take theirstand entirely with the Ministry of the Interior when they try to scare us with the prospect of the “disintegration of the state” and urge us to be “careful in handling” an absolutelyclear formula, which is accepted without question by theentire international democracy—the “political self-deter-mination” of nationalities. 
 We Social-Democrats are opposedto all nationalism and advocate democratic centralism . 
 We are opposed to particularism, and are convinced that, all other things being equal , big states can solve the prob-lems of economic progress and of the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie far more effectively than small states can. 
 But we value only voluntary ties, never compul-sory ties. 
 Wherever we see compulsory ties between nations we, while by no means insisting that every nation mustsecede, do absolutely and emphatically insist on the right of every nation to political self-determination, that is, tosecession. 
 To insist upon, to advocate, and to recognise this right is to insist on the equality of nations, to refuse to recognise compulsory ties, to oppose all state privileges for any nation whatsoever, and to cultivate a spirit of completeclass solidarity in the workers of the different nations. 
 The class solidarity of the workers of the different nations is strengthened by the substitution of voluntary ties for compulsory, feudalist and militarist ties. 
 We value most of all the equality of nations in popular liberties and for socialism.... 
 * and insist on the privileges of the Great Russians. 
 But we say: no privileges for any one nation, complete equality of nations and the unity, amalgamation of the workers of all nations . 
 Eighteen years ago, in 1896, the International Congress of Labour and Socialist Organisations in London adopted aresolution on the national question, which indicated theonly correct way to work for both real popular libertiesand socialism. 
 The resolution reads: “This Congress declares that it stands for the full right of all nations to self-determination, and expresses its sympathyfor the workers of every country now suffering under theyoke of military, national or other absolutism. 
 This Congresscalls upon the workers of all these countries to join the ranksof the class-conscious workers of the whole world in order jointly to fight for the defeat of international capitalism and for the achievement of the aims of international Social-Democracy. 
” And we, too, call for unity in the ranks of the workers of all nations in Russia, for only such unity can guaranteethe equality of nations and popular liberties, and safeguard the interests of socialism.

— Ed. 
 The year 1905 united the workers of all nations in Rus-sia. 
 The reactionaries are trying to foment national enmity. 
 The liberal bourgeoisie of all nations, first and foremost the Great-Russian bourgeoisie, is fighting for the priv-ileges of its own nation (for example, the Polish ko/o113 is opposed to equal rights for Jews in Poland), is fighting fornational segregation, for national exclusiveness, and isthereby promoting the policy of our Ministry of the Inte-rior. 
 But true democracy, headed by the working class, holds aloft the banner of complete equality of nations and of unityof the workers of all nations in their class struggle. 
 Fromthis point of view we reject so-called “cultural-nationalautonomy”, that is, the division of educational affairs in a given state according to nationality, or the proposal that education should be taken out of the hands of the state andtransferred to separately organised national associations. 
A democratic state must grant autonomy to its various re-gions, especially to regions with mixed populations. 
 Thisform of autonomy in no way contradicts democratic centralism; on the contrary, it is only through regional autonomy that genuine democratic centralism is possible in a large state with a mixed population. 
 A democratic state is bound togrant complete freedom for the various languages and annul all privileges for any one language. 
 A democratic state will not permit the oppression or the overriding of any one na-tionality by another, either in any particular region or in any branch of public affairs. 
 But to take education out of the hands of the state and to divide it according to nationality among separately organ-ised national associations is harmful from the point of viewof democracy, and still more harmful from the point of view of the proletariat. 
 This would merely serve to perpetuate the segregation of nations, whereas we must strive to unitethem. 
 It would lead to the growth of chauvinism, whereas wemust strive to unite the workers of all nations as closelyas possible, strive to unite them for a joint struggle againstall chauvinism, against all national exclusiveness, against all nationalism. 
 The workers of all nations have but one educational policy: freedom for the native language, anddemocratic and secular education. 
 I conclude by expressing my gratitude once again to Purishkevich, Markov II and Bobrinsky for their effective agitation against the entire political system in Russia, for the object-lessons they have given, which prove that Russia’s transformation into a democratic republic is inevitable. 
 Written later than April 6 (19), 1914 First published in 1924 in the journal Proletarskaya Revolutsia No. 
 3 (26)Published according to the manuscript CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS IN BRITAIN Dealing in Put Pravdy No. 
 34 with the interesting events in Ireland, we spoke of the policy of the British Liberals,who allowed themselves to be scared by the Conservatives. 
 * Since those lines were written, new events have occurred which have transformed that particular conflict (between the Liberals and Conservatives) over the question of HomeRule for Ireland into a general constitutional crisis inBritain. 
 As the Conservatives threatened a Protestant “rebel-lion” in Ulster against Home Rule for Ireland, the Liberal Government set part of its troops into motion in order to compel respect for the will of Parliament. 
 But what happened?Generals and other British Army officers mutinied!They declared that they would not fight against Protes-tant Ulster as that would run counter to their “patriotism”, and that they would resign. 
 The Liberal Government were absolutely stunned by this revolt of the landowners standing at the head of the army. 
 TheLiberals have been accustomed to console themselves withconstitutional illusions and phrases about the rule of law, andclose their eyes to the real relation of forces, to the class struggle. 
 And this real relation of forces has been such that, owing to the cowardice of the bourgeoisie, a number ofpre-bourgeois, medieval institutions and privileges of the landed gentry have been preserved in Britain. 
 To suppress the revolt of the aristocratic officers, the Liberal Government should have appealed to the people, to the masses, to the proletariat, but that was something the *See pp. 
 148-51 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 “enlightened” Liberal bourgeois gentlemen feared more than anything else. 
 The government actually made concessions to the mutinous officers, persuaded them to withdraw their resignations, and gave them written assurances that troops would not be used against Ulster. 
 Efforts were made to conceal from the people the dis-graceful fact that such written assurances had been given(March 21, new style), and the Liberal leaders, Asquith, Morley and others, lied in the most incredible and shameless manner in their official statements. 
 However, the truthcame out. 
 The fact that written promises had been given tothe officers was not denied. 
 Apparently, “pressure” wasbrought to bear by the King. 
 The resignation of Secretaryfor War Seely, the assumption of his portfolio by Asquith “himself”, the re-election of Asquith, the circular to the troops about respect for law—all this was nothing butsheer official hypocrisy. 
 The fact remains that the Liberalsyielded to the landowners, who had flouted the constitu-tion. 
 Stormy scenes ensued in Parliament. 
 The Conservatives heaped well-deserved ridicule and scorn upon the Liberal Government, while the Labour M. 
 P. 
, Ramsay MacDonald,one of the most moderate of the liberal-labour politicians,protested in the strongest terms against the reactionaries’conduct. 
 He said that these people were always ready tofulminate against strikers, but when it came to Ulster they refused to do their duty because the Irish Home Rule Bill affected their class prejudices and interests. 
 (The land-owners in Ireland are English, and Home Rule for Ireland,which would mean Home Rule for the Irish bourgeoisie andpeasants, threatens to somewhat curtail the voracious ap-petites of the noble lords. 
) These people, Ramsay MacDonald continued, thought only of fighting the workers, but when it came to compelling the rich and the property-owners to re-spect the law, they refused to do their duty. 
 This revolt of the landowners against the British Par-liament, the “all-powerful” Parliament (as the Liberaldullards, especially the Liberal pundits, have thought and said millions of times), is of tremendous significance. 
 March 21 (March 8, old style), 1914, will be an epoch-makingturning-point, the day when the noble landowners of Britain tore the British constitution and British law to shreds and gave an excellent lesson of the class struggle. 
 This lesson stemmed from the impossibility of blunting the sharp antagonisms between the proletariat and bourgeoi-sie of Britain by means of the half-hearted, hypocritical,sham-reformist policy of the Liberals. 
 This lesson willnot be lost upon the British labour movement; the workingclass will now quickly proceed to shake off its philistine faith in the scrap of paper called the British law and consti-tution, which the British aristocrats have torn up beforethe eyes of the whole people. 
 These aristocrats behaved like revolutionaries of the right and thereby shattered all conventions, tore aside the veil that prevented the people from seeing the unpleas-ant but undoubtedly real class struggle. 
 All saw what the bourgeoisie and the Liberals have been hypocriticallyconcealing (they are hypocrites everywhere, but nowhere,perhaps, such consummate hypocrites as in Britain). 
 Allsaw that the conspiracy to break the will of Parliament hadbeen prepared long ago. 
 Real class rule lay and still lies outside of Parliament. 
 The above-mentioned medieval in-stitutions, which for long had been inoperative (or ratherseemed to be inoperative), quickly came into operation andproved to be stronger than Parliament. 
 And Britain’s petty-bourgeois Liberals, with their speeches about reformsand the might of Parliament designed to lull the workers, proved in fact to be straw men, dummies, put up to bamboozle the people. 
 They were quickly “ shut up ” by the aristoc-racy, the men in power . 
 How many books have been written, especially by German and Russian liberals, in praise of law and social peacein Britain! Everybody knows that the historical mission of the German and Russian liberals is to show servile admiration for what the class struggle has produced in Britain and inFrance, and to proclaim the results of that struggle asthe “truths of science”, a science that stands “ above classes ”. 
 In reality, however, “law and social peace” in Britain weremerely a brief result of the torpor the British proletariat was in approximately between the 1850’s and 1900’s. 
 Britain’s monopoly has come to an end. 
 World competi-tion has sharpened. 
 The cost of living has gone up. 
 Associa-tions of big capitalists have crushed the small and medium businessmen and come down with their full weight upon the workers. 
 Once more the British proletariat has awakened after the close of the eighteenth century, after the Chartistmovement of the 1830’s and 1840’s. 
 The constitutional crisis of 1914 will mark another impor-tant stage in the history of this awakening. 
 Put Pravdy No. 
 57, Published according to April 10, 1914 the text in Put Pravdy UNITY Three issues of the journal Borba , which declares itself to be “non-factional”, have already appeared in St. 
 Peters-burg. 
 The journal’s main line is to advocate unity. 
 Unity with whom? With the liquidators . 
 The latest issue of Borba contains two articles in defence of unity with the liquidators . 
 The first article is by the well-known liquidator Y. 
 Larin, the same Larin who recently wrote in one of the liquida-tionist journals: “The path of capitalist development will be cleared of absolutist survivals without any revolution .... 
 The immediate talk is ... to im-bue wide circles with the leading idea that in the coming period theworking class must organise, not ‘for revolution’, not ‘in anticipationof revolution’ .... 
” Writing in Borba , this same liquidator now urges unity and proposes that it should take the form of federation . 
 Federation implies agreement between organisations en-joying equal rights. 
 Thus, in the matter of determiningthe tactics of the working class, Larin proposes placing the will of the overwhelming majority of the workers, who stand for the “uncurtailed slogans”, on an equal footing with the will of negligible groups of liquidators, whoseviews coincide more or less with the passage just quotedabove. 
 According to the subtle plan of the liquidator La-rin, the majority of the workers are to be deprived of the right to take any step until they obtain the consent of the liquidators of Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta . 
 The workers have rejected the liquidators, but now, according to the plan of the liquidator Larin, the latterare to regain a leading position by means of federation. 
Thus, the federation proposed by Larin is simply a new attempt to impose on the workers the will of the liquida-tors whom the working-class movement has rejected. 
 The liquidators reason as follows: we were not allowed to come in by the door, so we will steal in by the window, and call“unity through federation” that which is actually a viola-tion of the will of the majority of the workers. 
 The editors of Borba disagree with Larin. 
 Federation, i. 
e. 
, gradual agreement between the liquidators and the Marxists as equal parties , does not satisfy them. 
 It is not agreement with the liquidators they want but a new amalgamation with them “on the basis of commondecisions on tactics”, which means that the overwhelmingmajority of the workers, who have rallied to the tacticalline of Put Pravdy , must abandon their own decisions for the sake of common tactics with the liquidators . 
 In the opinion of Borba ’s editors, the tactics developed by the class-conscious workers, which have stood the testof experience of the entire movement during the past fewyears, must be set aside. 
 Why? So as to make room for thetactical plans of the liquidators, for views that have been condemned both by the workers and by the whole course of events. 
 Utter defiance of the will, the decisions and the views of the class-conscious workers is at the bottom of the ideaof unity with the liquidators which the editors of Borba propose. 
 The will of the workers has been clearly and definitely expressed. 
 Anyone who has not taken leave of his sensescan say exactly which tactics the overwhelming majority ofthe workers sympathise with. 
 But along comes the liquida-tor Larin and says: the will of the majority of the workersis nothing to me. 
 Let this majority get out of the way and agree that the will of a group of liquidators is equal to the will of the majority of the class-conscious workers. 
 After the liquidator comes a conciliator from Borba , who says: the workers have devised definite tactics forthemselves and are striving to apply them? That meansnothing at all. 
 Let them abandon these tested tactics for the sake of c ommon tactical decisions with the liquidators . 
 And the conciliators from Borba describe as unity this violation of the clearly expressed will of the majority of the workers, a violation designed to secure equality for the liquidators. 
 This, however, is not unity, but a flouting of unity, a flouting of the will of the workers. 
 This is not what the Marxist workers mean by unity. 
There can be no unity, federal or other, with liberal-labour politicians, with disruptors of the working-classmovement, with those who defy the will of the majority. 
 There can and must be unity among all consistent Marxists, among all those who stand for the entire Marxist body andfor the uncurtailed slogans, independently of the liquida-tors and apart from them. 
 Unity is a great thing and a great slogan. 
 But what the workers’ cause needs is the unity of Marxists , not unity between Marxists, and opponents and distorters of Marxism. 
 And we must ask everyone who talks about unity: unity with whom? With the liquidators? If so, we have nothingto do with each other. 
 But if it is a question of genuine Marxist unity, we shall say: Ever since the Pravdist newspapers appeared we have been calling for the unity of all the forces of Marxism, for unity from below, for unity in practical activities. 
 No flirting with the liquidators, no diplomatic nego-tiations with groups of wreckers of the corporate body; con-centrate all efforts on rallying the Marxist workers aroundthe Marxist slogans, around the entire Marxist body. 
 The class-conscious workers will regard as a crime any attempt to impose upon them the will of the liquidators; they willalso regard as a crime the fragmentation of the forces ofthe genuine Marxists. 
 For the basis of unity is class discipline, recognition of the will of the majority, and concerted activities in the ranks of, and in step with, that majority. 
 We shall never tire of calling all the workers towards this unity, this discipline,and these concerted activities. 
 Put Pravdy No. 
 59, Published according to April 12, 1914 the text in Put Pravdy ORGANISED ISTS ON INTERVENTION BY THE INTERNATIONAL BUREAU We are informed that the International Bureau has re-ceived the reply of the organised Marxists to the Bureau’s offer to intervene in the affairs of Russian Social-Democ-racy. 
114 We publish below the more important parts of this reply. 
 * * * Following receipt of the “Supplement” to No. 
 11 of The Periodical Bulletin of the International Bureau , the representative body of Russia’s organised Marxists feelsbound to express profound gratitude to the InternationalBureau and its Executive Committee for their assistance tothe working-class movement and for their efforts to strength-en and consolidate it by ensuring its unity. 
 The present situation among Russian Marxists is as follows. 
 The general state of affairs in 1907-08 led to an extreme-ly grave ideological crisis among Marxists and the break-up of their organisations. 
 Both in 1908 and in 1910, organ-ised Marxists formally recognised the existence of a spe-cial theory advocated by the liquidators , who repudiated and sought to liquidate the old Party, and were out to forma new and legal party. 
 This trend was emphatically and irre-vocably condemned by a formal decision. 
 However, the liqu-idators refused to accept these decisions and continued theirsplitting and disruptive activities against the “entire body”. 
 In January 1912, 115 the entire Marxist body was opposed to the liquidators, who were declared to be outsideits ranks. 
 Since then, the overwhelming majority of class-consci-ous workers in Russia have rallied in support of the deci-sions adopted in January 1912 and of the guiding body that was elected at the time. 
 This fact, of which all workersin Russia are aware, can and must be corroborated by ob-jective facts, in view of the incredible number of unsup-ported and grossly untrue statements circulated by theliquidators and by the scattered groups abroad. 
 1. 
 The electoral law of Russia places the workers in a sep-arate worker curia. 
 Of the members of the Duma electedby this curia, the Bolsheviks constituted 47 per cent in theSecond Duma (1907), 50 per cent in the Third Duma (1907-12),and 67 per cent in the Fourth Duma (1912-14). 
The elections to the Fourth Duma were held in September 1912, and the majority that was gained (two-thirds) proved organised Marxism’s complete victory over liquida-tionism. 
 2. 
 In April 1912, the Marxist daily newspaper Pravda began to appear. 
 In opposition to it, the liquidators start-ed, also in St. 
 Petersburg, a rival organ, Luch , which pur-sued splitting tactics. 
 In the course of two years, from Jan-uary 1, 1912 to January 1, 1914, the liquidators’ newspaper,together with all their supporters in the shape of the numer-ous groups abroad and the Bund, received the back-ing—according to that newspaper’s own reports—of 750 workers’ groups, whereas during the same period Pravda , which fights for the Marxist line, rallied around itself 2,801 workers’ groups. 
 3. 
 Early in 1914, elections were held in St. 
 Petersburg of representatives of the workers’ sick insurance socie-ties on the All-Russia Insurance Board and the Metro-politan Insurance Board. 
 To the first body the workers elected five members and ten deputy-members; to the second, they elected two members and four deputy-members. 
 Inboth cases, the lists of candidates put forward by Pravda sup-porters were elected in their entirety . 
 In the last elections the ballot figures announced by the chairman were: Pravda supporters— 37; liquidators— 7; Narodniks— 4; absten-tions— 5. 
 We shall confine ourselves to these very brief figures. 
 They show that real unity among Marxists in Russia is making steady headway and that the unity of the majority of the class-conscious workers on the basis of the decisions of January 1912 has already been achieved. 
 The document then goes on to describe the disruptive activities of the various groups abroad and the liquidators,who are persistently trying to thwart the will of the majority of Russian workers. 
 Besides partyists and liquidators, there are now no less than five separate Russian Social-Democratic groups operating abroad, besides the national groups. 
 For twowhole years, 1912 and 1913, there has not been a shadow ofany objective evidence that these groups abroad are in touchwith the working-class movement in Russia. 
 In August 1912the liquidators formed what is called the “August bloc”, which included, among others, Trotsky, the “Bund”, and the Lettish Social-Democrats. 
 That this “bloc”—which reallyserved as a screen for the liquidators—was a fiction, waspointed out long ago. 
 Now this “bloc” has fallen completelyapart. 
 The Congress of the Lettish Social-Democrats, whichwas held in February 1914, decided to withdraw its represent-atives from the bloc because the latter had not dissociated itself from the liquidators. 
 Trotsky, too, in February 1914,founded his own group’s journal, in which he backedhis outcries for unity by breaking away from the August bloc! The “Organising Committee”, which now represents the “August bloc”, is a pure fiction, and it is obviously impossible to enter into any relations with that fiction. 
 Since the liq-uidators talk about “unity” and “equality”, it should be saidthat it is the prime duty of advocates of unity to refrain fromthrowing into disarray the ranks of the united overwhelm-ing majority of the workers, and emphatically to repudiate the liquidators, who are out to destroy the entire Marxist body. 
 Talk about “unity” coming from the liquidators is noless a mockery of the actual unity of the majority of theworkers in Russia than similar talk about unity by the “Al-lemane-Cambier party” in France, or by the “P. 
P. 
S. 
” inGermany. 
 The authors then go on urgently to request the Executive Committee of the International Socialist Bureau to bendevery effort to hasten the “interchange of opinion among all the Social-Democratic groups on controversial issues” (resolu-tion of the December 1913 session of the International Bureau), in order to expose to an impartial body, to the Inter-national, the utterly fictitious nature of the “August bloc”and of the liquidators’ “Organising Committee”, and alsoto expose all their disruptive activities against the unitedmajority of the Social-Democratic workers of Russia. 
 Put Pravdy No. 
 61, Published according to April 15, 1914 the text in Put Pravdy NATIONAL EQUALITY In Put Pravdy No. 
 48 (for March 28), the Russian Social-Democratic Labour group in the Duma published the textof its Bill on national equality, or, to quote its official title,“Bill for the Abolition of All Disabilities of the Jews and ofAll Restrictions on the Grounds of Origin or Nationality”. 
 * Amidst the alarms and turmoil of the struggle for exist-ence, for a bare livelihood, the Russian workers cannot andmust not forget the yoke of national oppression under whichthe tens and tens of millions of “subject peoples” inhabitingRussia are groaning. 
 The ruling nation—the Great Russians—constitute about 45 per cent of the total population of the Empire. 
 Out of every 100 inhabitants, over 50 belong to “subject peoples”. 
 And the conditions of life of this vast population are even harsher than those of the Russians. 
 The policy of oppressing nationalities is one of dividing nations. 
 At the same time it is a policy of systematic cor-ruption of the people’s minds. 
 The Black Hundreds’ plans are designed to foment antagonism among the differentnations, to poison the minds of the ignorant and downtroddenmasses. 
 Pick up any Black-Hundred newspaper and you willfind that the persecution of non-Russians, the sowing ofmutual distrust between the Russian peasant, the Russian petty bourgeois and the Russian artisan on the one hand, and the Jewish, Finnish, Polish, Georgian and Ukrainianpeasants, petty bourgeois and artisans on the other, is meatand drink to the whole of this Black-Hundred gang. 
 But the working class needs unity , not division . 
 It has no more bitter enemy than the savage prejudices and su-perstitions which its enemies sow among the ignorant masses, *See pp. 
 172-73 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 The oppression of “subject peoples” is a double-edged weapon. 
 It cuts both ways—against the “subject peoples” and against the Russian people. 
 That is why the working class must protest most strongly against national oppression in any shape and form. 
 It must counter the agitation of the Black Hundreds, who try to divert its attention to the baiting of non-Rus-sians, by asserting its conviction as to the need for complete equality, for the complete and final rejection of all privi-leges for any one nation. 
 The Black Hundreds carry on a particularly venomous hate-campaign against the Jews. 
 The Purishkeviches try tomake the Jewish people the scapegoat for all their own sins. 
 And that is why the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
 group in the Duma did right in putting Jewish disabilities in the forefront of its Bill. 
 The schools, the press, the parliamentary rostrum—every-thing is being used to sow ignorant, savage, and vicioushatred of the Jews. 
 This dirty and despicable work is undertaken, not only by the scum of the Black Hundreds, but also by reactionary professors, scholars, journalists and members of the Duma. 
Millions and thousands of millions of rubles are spent onpoisoning the minds of the people. 
 It is a point of honour for the Russian workers to have this Bill against national oppression backed by tens of thou-sands of proletarian signatures and declarations.... 
 This will be the best means of consolidating complete unity, amalgamat-ing all the workers of Russia, irrespective of nationality. 
 Put Pravdy No. 
 62, Published according to April 16, 1914 the text in Put Pravdy THE LIQUIDATORS AND THE LETTISH WORKING -CLASS MOVEMENT The recent decision of all organised Lettish workers condemning the liquidators and supporting the Marxistline, struck a decisive blow at the “August bloc”, by show-ing that sooner or later all proletarian elements will break with the liquidators. 
 Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta is doing its utmost to explain away this unpleasant fact. 
 Thisrather difficult job has been tackled by L. 
 M. 
 and F. 
 D. 
 We shall not trouble to reply to the petty wrangling which the liquidators have started. 
 The only aspect of the matter we consider important is that which has organisation-al and political significance. 
 The liquidators say: True, the Lettish Marxists have withdrawn from the “August bloc”, but they have not joinedthe “Leninists”. 
 Quite right, gentlemen! The Lettish Marxists have indeed remained neutral . 
 In our very first articles concern-ing the Lettish decisions, we said that the Letts had takenonly the first step , that, generally speaking, they had acted like conciliators . 
 * But have the liquidators considered what follows from this? If the Letts are really conciliators, if they advocate unity at any price, and if they are neutral in the organisational conflict, then the political appraisal of liquidationism madeby the conciliatory Lettish Marxists is a still more telling blow at the liquidators . 
 From the political aspect, this appraisal is quite clear and straightforward. 
 The Lettish workers have emphatically en-dorsed the old decision that liquidationism is a manifestation *See pp. 
 177-81 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 of bourgeois influence on the proletariat . 
 They have de-clared that unity with the liquidators means becoming “ideo-logically and politically dependent upon the liquidators”. 
 Yes, Messrs. 
 L. 
 M. 
 and F. 
 D. 
, the Letts have indeed remained neutral; they have not yet abandoned “concilia-tory” hopes; they have not yet drawn all the practical con-clusions from the stand they took; they have given toolenient treatment to the groups which defend you. 
 But it was precisely these lenient and neutral people who told you that your liquidationist line expressed only the influenceof the bourgeoisie on the backward sections of the work-ers. 
 The ludicrous muddle the liquidators have got themselves into in appraising the Lettish decisions can be seen from the articles published in Zeit , a newspaper of the Jewish liquidators. 
 Here Mr. 
 Yonov tells us in verbose articlesthat “the Lettish comrades do not stand for a split; on thecontrary, they strongly oppose such tactics”. 
 The same writer goes on to say that “the general spirit of the resolution [of the Letts] is beyond all doubt the Leninist spirit. 
 It [the resolution] is based on hostility towards liquidationism, on recognition of the need to com-bat it” ( Zeit No. 
 14). 
 Agree among yourselves, liquidators, and say either one thing or the other. 
 The liquidators hope that the Letts will yet take a step backward —to liquidationism. 
 We hope that they will take a step forward, to the position of the Russian Marx-ists. 
 Time will show whose hopes will be justified. 
 Wecalmly leave that to the course of the Lettish and of theentire Russian working-class movement. 
 For the present,one thing has been achieved: the Letts have dealt mortal blow at the “August bloc” and recognised that liquidation-ism is a bourgeois trend. 
 A few words about the Letts’ decision concerning the split in the Social-Democratic group in the Duma. 
 The sixliquidator deputies have not given a straightforward answerto the question as to whether they accept the terms of the Letts. 
 With Mr. 
 F. 
 D. 
’s assistance, they are trying to “pull the wool over our eyes”, as the saying goes. 
 However, theywill not succeed. 
 Look at Mr. 
 F. 
 D. 
’s “arguments”. 
 Confronted with the 1908 decision (which the Letts endorsed ) against amalga-mation with the Jagiello party, he replies by stating that the Social-Democratic group in the Second Duma accepted ... theLithuanian Social-Democrats. 
 The “slight” difference hereis merely that Russia’s Marxists resolved on more thanone occasion to amalgamate with the Lithuanians, but not to amalgamate with the P. 
S. 
P. 
, because that party is not Marxist. 
 The difference is that the Lithuanian deputies were returned to the Duma with the full support of all thelocal Social-Democrats, whereas Jagiello was elected in the teeth of opposition from the Polish Social-Democrats, in the teeth of opposition from the majority of the worker electors. 
 The Letts made it a condition of unity that the all-Rus-sia decisions of 1908 and 1910 condemning liquidationismas a bourgeois trend should be recognised. 
 Does the Chkheidze group accept this condition? What has Mr. 
 F. 
 D. 
, whodefends this group, to say about this? Only that “lack ofspace prevents us [i. 
e. 
, him] from dealing” with these all-Russia decisions. 
 Very well, we shall wait until Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta finds more space in which to say, at last, what its attitude is towards the 1908 and 1910 decisions of theentire Marxist body, which recognised liquidationism as abourgeois trend. 
 As for the workers, they will undoubtedly draw their own conclusions from the liquidators’ shuffling, and realisethat these people are dead to the cause of Marxism. 
 Put Pravdy No. 
 62, Published according to April 16, 1914 the text in Put Pravdy SERF ECONOMY IN THE RURAL AREAS Our liberals refuse to admit that serf economy is still practised on a vast scale in the Russian countryside to this day. 
 Serfdom lives on, for when the semi-pauper peasant, held in bondage by means of money loans or the renting ofland, works for the landlord with his wretched horse andimplements, we have here the economic essence of serfeconomy. 
 Under capitalism the worker owns neither land nor imple-ments of production. 
 Under serf economy the exploited la-bourer has both land and implements of production, but theseserve to enslave him, to tie him to the “squire”. 
 The journal Russkaya Mysl , which is noted for its preach-ing of respect for landed property, accidentally blurted out the truth in its March issue. 
 “Winter hiring, ”116 we read in that issue “—is this not absurd in our age, the age of electricity and aeroplanes? And yet this form of slavery and bondage continues to flourish to this day, like a leech on thebody of the peasantry. 
 “Winter hiring is a curious and characteristic feature of ancient Russia. 
 It has preserved in all its freshness the feudal term of ‘bondedpeasants’. 
” This was written not by some “Left” organ, but by a jour-nal of the counter-revolutionary liberals! According to local statistics for the spring of 1913, the “bonded” households sometimes—as, for example, in Cher-nigov Gubernia—constitute as much as 56 per cent, i. 
e. 
, nearly three-fifths , of the total number of households. 
 And during winter hire the peasant receives half or one-third of the pay he gets during summer hire. 
 Here we have purely serf bondage and hopeless poverty among the peasants, side by side with “progress” in the development of the otrubs , fodder grass cultivation, the employment of machines, and so forth, over which some naïvepeople wax so enthusiastic. 
 As a matter of fact, this prog-ress, perpetuating as it does appalling poverty and bond-age among the masses of the peasants, only worsens theirconditions, makes crises more inevitable, and intensifies the contradiction between the requirements of modern capitalism and barbarous, medieval and Asiatic “winterhiring”. 
 Métayage, tilling the soil in return for half the crop, or mowing hay in return for every third haycock (the “one-third” system) are also direct survivals of serfdom. 
 Ac-cording to the latest statistics, the area of land cultivated by peasants on the métayer system in the various districtsof Russia ranges from 21 to 68 per cent of the area of thepeasants’ own land. 
 And the area of land on which hay ismown on the métayer system is even larger, ranging from 50to 185 per cent of the area of the peasants’ own land !... “In some cases,” we read in this moderate-liberal journal, “the métayer, in addition to paying for the land with half the crop, and forthe hay with two-thirds of the crop, is obliged to work gratis on the owner’s farm for one or two weeks, in most cases with his own horse,or with one of his children. 
” How does this differ from serfdom? The peasant works for the landlord without pay, and receives land from him on amétayage basis! Our liberals always regard the “peasant question” from the point of view of the peasants’ “land hunger” or the need for“state arrangement” of the peasants’ living conditions, or of allotting them land according to this or that “norm” (this is a fault of the Narodniks, too). 
 This point of viewis basically erroneous. 
 It is all a matter of the class struggleon the basis of the feudal relations of production, and noth-ing more. 
 So long as the present system of landlordismexists, the perpetuation of bondage, serfdom and, as Russkaya Mysl expresses it, slavery, is inevitable . 
 No “reforms” or political changes will be of any use here. 
 The point atissue here is the ownership of the land by a class which reduces all “progress” to snail’s pace, and turns the masses of the peasantry into downtrodden paupers tied to the “squire”. 
 The issue here is not that of a “subsistence” or a “pro-ducer’s” norm (all this is Narodnik nonsense), not that of“land hunger”, or “allotting land”, but of abolishing class,semi-feudal oppression, which is hindering the developmentof a capitalist country. 
 Only in this way can the “proverbial” “pillars” of the class-conscious Russian workers begin to be understood. 
 Put Pravdy No. 
 66, Published according to April 20, 1914 the text in Put Pravdy THE HISTORY OF THE WORKERS ’ PRESS IN RUSSIA The history of the workers’ press in Russia is indissolubly linked up with the history of the democratic and socialist movement. 
 Hence, only by knowing the chief stages of the movement for emancipation is it possible to understandwhy the preparation and rise of the workers’ press proceededin a certain way, and in no other. 
 The emancipation movement in Russia has passed through three main stages, corresponding to the three main classes of Russian society, which have left their impress on the movement: (1) the period of the nobility, roughly from 1825to 1861; (2) the raznochintsi or bourgeois-democratic period, approximately from 1861 to 1895; and (3) the prole-tarian period, from 1895 to the present time. 
 The most outstanding figures of the nobility period were the Decembrists 117 and Herzen. 
 At that time, under the serf-owning system, there could be no question ofdifferentiating a working class from among the general mass of serfs, the disfranchised “lower orders”, “theruck”. 
 In those days the illegal general democratic press,headed by Herzen’s Kolokol , 118 was the forerunner of the workers’ (proletarian-democratic or Social-Democratic) press. 
 Just as the Decembrists roused Herzen, so Herzen and his Kolokol helped to rouse the raznochintsi —the educated representatives of the liberal and democratic bourgeoisiewho belonged, not to the nobility but to the civil servants, urban petty bourgeois, merchant and peasant classes. 
 It was V. 
 G. 
 Belinsky who, even before the abolition of serf-dom, was a forerunner of the raznochintsi who were to completely oust the nobility from our emancipation movement. 
 The famous Letter to Gogol,119 which summed up Belinsky’s literary activities, was one of the finest produc-tions of the illegal democratic press, which has to this daylost none of its great and vital significance. 
 With the fall of the serf-owning system, the raznochintsi emerged as the chief actor from among the masses in themovement for emancipation in general, and in the democratic illegal press in particular. 
 Narodism, 120 which corresponded to the raznochintsi point of view, became the dominant trend. 
 As a social trend, it never succeeded in dissociatingitself from liberalism on the right and from anarchism onthe left. 
 But Chernyshevsky, who, after Herzen, developedthe Narodnik views, made a great stride forward as compared with Herzen. 
 Chernyshevsky was a far more consistent and militant democrat, his writings breathing the spirit ofthe class struggle. 
 He resolutely pursued the line of expos-ing the treachery of liberalism, a line which to this day ishateful to the Cadets and liquidators. 
 He was a remarkablyprofound critic of capitalism despite his utopian social-ism. 
 The sixties and seventies saw quite a number of illegal publications, militant-democratic and utopian-socialist incontent, which had started to circulate among the “masses”. 
Very prominent among the personalities of that epoch werethe workers Pyotr Alexeyev, Stepan Khalturin, and others. 
 The proletarian-democratic current, however, was unable to free itself from the mainstream of Narodism; this becamepossible only after Russian Marxism took ideological shape(the Emancipation of Labour group, 1883), and a steadyworkers’ movement, linked with Social-Democracy,began (the St. 
 Petersburg strikes of 1895-96). 
 But before passing to this period, from which the appear-ance of the workers’ press in Russia really dates, we shallquote figures which strikingly illustrate the class differences between the movements of the three periods referred to. 
These figures show the classification of persons charged withstate (political) crimes according to social estate or calling (class).

4 In the nobility or feudal period (1827-46), the nobles, who were an insignificant minority of the population, ac-counted for the vast majority of the “politicals” (76%). 
In the Narodnik, raznochintsi period (1884-90; unfortunately, figures for the sixties and seventies are not available), thenobles dropped to second place, but still provided quitea high percentage (30. 
6%). 
 Intellectuals accounted for the overwhelming majority (73. 
2%) of participants in the democratic movement. 
 In the 1901-03 period, which happened to be the period of the first political Marxist newspaper, the old Iskra , workers (46. 
1%) predominated over intellectuals (36. 
7%) and the movement became wholly democratised (10. 
7% no-bles and 80. 
9% “non-privileged” people). 
 Running ahead, we see that in the period of the first mass movement (1905-08) the only change was that the in-tellectuals (28. 
4% as against 36. 
7%) were displaced by peas-ants (24. 
2% as against 9. 
0%). 
 Social-Democracy in Russia was founded by the Emancipa-tion of Labour group, which was formed abroad in 1883. 
 The writings of this group, which were printed abroad and uncen-sored, were the first systematically to expound and draw allthe practical conclusions from the ideas of Marxism, which,as the experience of the entire world has shown, alone ex-press the true essence of the working-class movement and its aims. 
 For the twelve years between 1883 and 1895, practical-ly the only attempt to establish a Social-Democratic workers’press in Russia was the publication in St. 
 Petersburg in1885 of the Social-Democratic newspaper Rabochy ; it was of course illegal, but only two issues appeared. 
 Owing to theabsence of a mass working-class movement, there was no scope for the wide development of a workers ’ press. 
 The inception of a mass working-class movement, with the participation of Social-Democrats, dates from 1895-96, the time of the famous St. 
 Petersburg strikes. 
 It was then that a workers’ press, in the real sense of the term, ap-peared in Russia. 
 The chief publications in those days were illegal leaflets, most of them hectographed and devoted to“economic” (as well as non-economic) agitation, that is, tothe needs and demands of the workers in different factoriesand industries. 
 Obviously, this literature could not haveexisted without the advanced workers’ most active partic-ipation in the task of compiling and circulating it. 
 Among St. 
 Petersburg workers active at the time mention should bemade of Vasily Andreyevich Shelgunov, who later becameblind and was unable to carry on with his former vigour,and Ivan Vasilyevich Babushkin, an ardent Iskrist (1900-03)and Bolshevik (1903-05), who was shot for taking part in an uprising in Siberia late in 1905 or early in 1906. 
 Leaflets were published by Social-Democratic groups, circles and organisations, most of which, after the end of1895, became known as “Leagues of Struggle for the Eman-cipation of the Working Class”. 
 The “Russian Social-Demo-cratic Labour Party” was founded in 1898 at a congress of representatives of local Social-Democratic organisations. 
 121 After the leaflets, illegal working-class newspapers began to appear; for example, in 1897 St. 
 Petersburg Rabochy Listok122 appeared in St. 
 Petersburg, followed by Rabochaya Mysl , which was shortly afterwards transferred abroad. 
 Since then, almost right up to the revolution, local Social-Democratic newspapers came out illegally; true, they were regularly suppressed, but reappeared again andagain all over Russia. 
 All in all, the workers’ leaflets and Social-Democratic newspapers of the time—i. 
e. 
, twenty years ago—were thedirect forerunners of the present-day working-class press: the same factory “exposures”, the same reports on the “eco-nomic” struggle, the same treatment of the tasks of the work-ing-class movement from the standpoint of Marxist princi-ples and consistent democracy, and finally, the same two main trends —the Marxist and the opportunist—in the working-class press. 
 It is a remarkable fact, one that has not been duly ap-preciated to this day, that as soon as the mass working-class movement arose in Russia (1895-96), there at once appeared the division into Marxist and opportunist trends— a division which has changed in form and features, etc. 
, but which has remained essentially the same from 1894 to 1914. 
 Apparently, this particular kind of division andinner struggle among Social-Democrats has deep social andclass roots. 
 The Rabochaya Mysl , mentioned above, represented the opportunist trend of the day, known as Economism. 
 This trend became apparent in the disputes among the local lead-ers of the working-class movement as early as 1894-95. 
And abroad, where the awakening of the Russian workersled to an efflorescence of Social-Democratic literature asearly as 1896, the appearance and rallying of the Econo-mists ended in a split in the spring of 1900 (that is, prior to the appearance of Iskra , the first issue of which came off the press at the very end of 1900). 
 The history of the working-class press during the twenty years 1894-1914 is the history of the two trends in RussianMarxism and Russian (or rather all-Russia) Social-Democ-racy. 
 To understand the history of the working-class press in Russia, one must know, not only and not so much the names of the various organs of the press—names which con-vey nothing to the present-day reader and simply confusehim—as the content , nature and ideological line of the differ-ent sections of Social-Democracy. 
 The chief organs of the Economists were Rabochaya Mysl (1897-1900) and Rabocheye Dyelo (1898-1901). 
 Rabocheye Dyelo was edited by B. 
 Krichevsky, who later went over to the syndicalists, A. 
 Martynov, a prominent Menshevik andnow a liquidator, and Akimov, now an “independent Social-Democrat” who in all essentials agrees with the liquidators. 
 At first only Plekhanov and the whole Emancipation of Labour group (the journal Rabotnik , 123 etc. 
) fought the Econ-omists, and then Iskra joined the fight (from 1900 to August 1903, up to the time of the Second Congress ofthe R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
). 
 What, exactly, was the essence of Econo-mism? In word, the Economists were all for a mass type of work-ing-class movement and independent action by the work-ers, emphasising the paramount significance of “economic”agitation and urging moderation or gradualness in pass-ing over to political agitation. 
 As the reader sees, these are exactly the same catchwords that the liquidators flaunt today. 
 In practice, however, the Economists pursued a liberal-labour policy, the gist of which was tersely ex-pressed by S. 
 N. 
 Prokopovich, one of the Economist leadersat that time, in the words: “economic struggle is for theworkers, political struggle is for the liberals”. 
 The Econ-omists, who made the most noise about the workers’ in-dependent activity and the mass movement, were in prac-tice an opportunist and petty-bourgeois intellectual wing ofthe working-class movement. 
 The overwhelming majority of the class-conscious work-ers, who in 1901-03 accounted for 46 out of every 100 per-sons charged with state crimes, as against 37 for the intel-ligentsia, sided with the old Iskra , against the opportun-ists. 
 Iskra ’s three years of activity (1901-03) saw the elab-oration of the Social-Democratic Party’s Programme, itsmain tactics, and the forms in which the workers’ economicand political struggle could be combined on the basis ofconsistent Marxism. 
 During the pre-revolutionary years, the growth of the workers’ press around Iskra and under its ideological leadership assumed enormous proportions. 
 Thenumber of illegal leaflets and unlicensed printing-presseswas exceedingly great, and increased rapidly all overRussia. 
 Iskra ’s complete victory over Economism, the victory of consistent proletarian tactics over opportunist-intel-lectualist tactics in 1903, still further stimulated the influxof “fellow-travellers” into the ranks of Social-Democracy;and opportunism revived on the soil of Iskrism , as part of it, in the form of “Menshevism”. 
 Menshevism took shape at the Second Congress of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 (August 1903), originating from the minority of the Iskrists (hence the name Menshevism *) and from all the opportunist opponents of Iskra. 
 The Mensheviks re-verted to Economism in a slightly renovated form, of course;headed by A. 
 Martynov, all the Economists who had remainedin the movement flocked to the ranks of the Mensheviks. 
 *The Russian word Menshevism is derived from menshinstvo , the English for which is minority. 
— Ed. 
 The new Iskra , which from November 1903 appeared under a new editorial board, became the chief organ of Men-shevism. 
 “Between the old Iskra and the new lies a gulf”, Trotsky, then an ardent Menshevik, frankly declared. 
 Vperyod and Proletary124 (1905) were the chief Bolshevik newspapers, which upheld the tactics of consistent Marxismand remained faithful to the old Iskra . 
 From the point of view of real contact with the masses and as an expression of the tactics of the proletarian masses,1905-07, the years of revolution, were a test of the twomain trends in Social-Democracy and in the working-classpress—the Menshevik and Bolshevik trends. 
 A legal Social-Democratic press could not have appeared all at once inthe autumn of 1905 had the way not been paved by the activ-ities of the advanced workers, who were closely connected with the masses. 
 The fact that the legal Social-Democratic press of 1905, 1906 and 1907 was a press of two trends, of two groups, can only be accounted for by the different linesin the working-class movement at the time—the petty-bour-geois and the proletarian. 
 The workers’ legal press appeared in all three periods of the upswing and of relative “freedom”, namely, in theautumn of 1905 (the Bolsheviks’ Novaya Zhiz n, 125 and the Mensheviks’ Nachalo126—we name only the chief of the many publications); in the spring of 1906 ( Volna , Ekho ,127 etc. 
, issued by the Bolsheviks, Narodnaya Duma128 and others, issued by the Mensheviks); and in the spring of 1907. 
 The essence of the Menshevik tactics of the time was re-cently expressed by L. 
 Martov in these words: “The Men-sheviks saw no other way by which the proletariat couldtake a useful part in that crisis except by assisting thebourgeois liberal democrats in their attempts to eject the reactionary section of the propertied classes from politi-cal power—but, while rendering this assistance, the prole-tariat was to maintain its complete political independence. 
”(Among Books by Rubakin, Vol. 
 II, p. 
 772. 
) In practice, these tactics of “assisting” the liberals amounted to makingthe workers dependent on them; in practice they were lib-eral-labour tactics. 
 The Bolsheviks’ tactics, on the contrary,ensured the independence of the proletariat in the bourgeoiscrisis, by fighting to bring that crisis to a head, by exposing the treachery of liberalism, by enlightening and rallying the petty bourgeoisie (especially in the countryside) to coun-teract that treachery. 
 It is a fact—and the Mensheviks themselves, including the present-day liquidators, Koltsov, Levitsky, and others,have repeatedly admitted it—that in those years (1905-07)the masses of the workers followed the lead of the Bolshe-viks. 
 Bolshevism expressed the proletarian essence of the movement, Menshevism was its opportunist, petty-bourgeois intellectual wing. 
 We cannot here give a more detailed characterisation of the content and significance of the tactics of the twotrends in the workers’ press. 
 We can do no more than ac-curately establish the main facts and define the main lines of historical development. 
 The working-class press in Russia has almost a century of history behind it; first, the pre-history, i. 
e. 
, the his-tory, not of the labour, not of the proletarian, but of the “general democratic”, i. 
e. 
, bourgeois-democratic movementfor emancipation, followed by its own twenty-year history of the proletarian movement, proletarian democracy or Social-Democracy. 
 Nowhere in the world has the proletarian movement come into being, nor could it have come into being, “all at once”,in a pure class form, ready-made, like Minerva from thehead of Jupiter. 
 Only through long struggle and hard work on the part of the most advanced workers, of all class-con-scious workers, was it possible to build up and strengthenthe class movement of the proletariat, ridding it of allpetty-bourgeois admixtures, restrictions, narrowness anddistortions. 
 The working class lives side by side with thepetty bourgeoisie, which, as it becomes ruined, provides increasing numbers of new recruits to the ranks of the prole-tariat. 
 And Russia is the most petty-bourgeois, the mostphilistine of capitalist countries, which only now is pass-ing through the period of bourgeois revolutions whichBritain, for example, passed through in the seventeenthcentury, and France in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. 
 The class-conscious workers, who are now tackling a job that is near and dear to them, that of running the working-class press, putting it on a sound basis and strengthen-ing and developing it, will not forget the twenty-year his-tory of Marxism and the Social-Democratic press in Russia. 
 A disservice is being done to the workers’ movement by those of its weak-nerved friends among the intelligentsiawho fight shy of the internal struggle among the Social-Democrats, and who fill the air with cries and calls to havenothing to do with it. 
 They are well-meaning but futile people, and their outcries are futile. 
 Only by studying the history of Marxism’s struggle against opportunism, only by making a thorough and detailedstudy of the manner in which independent proletarian democ-racy emerged from the petty-bourgeois hodge-podge can theadvanced workers decisively strengthen their own class-consciousness and their workers’ press. 
 Rabochy No. 
 1, Published according to April 22, 1914 the text in Rabochy WHAT SHOULD NOT BE COPIED THE GERMAN LABOUR MOVEMENT Karl Legien, one of the most prominent and responsible representatives of the German trade unions, recently pub-lished a report of his visit to America in the form of a rather bulky book entitled The Labour Movement in America . 
 As a very prominent representative of the internation-al as well as German trade union movement, K. 
 Legien gavehis visit the nature of a special occasion, one of state im-portance, one might say. 
 For years he conducted negotia-tions on this visit with the Socialist Party of America and the American Federation of Labour, the labour-union organ-isation led by the famous (or rather infamous) Gompers. 
When Legien heard that Karl Liebknecht was going to Amer-ica, he refused to go at the same time “so as to avoid thesimultaneous appearance in the United States of two spokes-men whose views on the party’s tactics and on the impor-tance and value of certain branches of the labour movement did not entirely coincide”. 
 K. 
 Legien collected a vast amount of material on the labour-union movement in America, but failed to digest itin his book, which is cluttered up with patchy descriptionsof his journey, trivial in content and trite in style. 
 Even the labour-union rules of America, in which Legien was particularly interested, are not studied or analysed, butmerely translated incompletely and without system. 
 There was a highly instructive episode in Legien’s tour, which strikingly revealed the two tendencies in the inter-national and particularly in the German labour move-ment. 
 Legien visited the chamber of deputies of the United States, known as the Congress. 
 Brought up in the police-ridden Prussian state, he was favourably impressed by the democratic customs of the Republic, and he remarks with understandable pleasure that in America the government pro-vides every congressman not only with a private officefitted with all modern conveniences, but also with a paidsecretary to help him cope with a congressman’s manifoldduties. 
 The simplicity and easy manners of the congressmenand the Speaker of the House were in striking contrast with what Legien had seen in European parliaments, and especial-ly in Germany. 
 In Europe, a Social-Democrat could not eventhink of delivering to a bourgeois parliament at an officialsession a speech of greeting! But in America this was donevery simply, and the name of Social-Democrat did notfrighten anybody ... except that Social-Democrat himself ! We have here an example of the American bourgeois method of killing unsteady socialists with kindness, andthe German opportunist method of renouncing socialismin deference to the “kindly”, suave and democratic bour-geoisie. 
 Legien’s speech of greeting was translated into Eng-lish (democracy was not in the least averse to hearing a “foreign” language spoken in its parliament); all two hun-dred odd congressmen shook hands in turn with Legien asthe “guest” of the Republic, and the speaker expressed histhanks. 
 “The form and content of my speech of greeting,” writes Legien, “were sympathetically received by the socialist press both in the Unit-ed States and Germany. 
 Certain editors in Germany, however, couldnot resist pointing out that my speech proved once again what an im-possible task it is for a Social-Democrat to deliver a Social-Demo-cratic speech to a bourgeois audience. 
 Well, in my place, these edi-tors would, no doubt, have delivered a speech against capitalism and in favour of a mass strike, but I considered it important to emphasise to this parliament that the Social-Democratic and industrially or-ganised workers of Germany want peace among the nations, and throughpeace, the development of culture to the highest degree attainable. 
” Poor “editors”, whom our Legien has annihilated with his “statesmanlike” speech! The opportunism of trade union leaders in general, and of Legien in particular, has long been common knowledge in the German labour movement,and has been duly appraised by a great many class-conscious workers. 
 But with us in Russia, where far too much is spoken about the “model” of European socialism with precisely the worst, most objectionable features of this “model” being chosen, it would be advisable to deal with Legien’s speechin somewhat greater detail. 
 When he addressed the highest body of representatives of capitalist America, this leader of a two-million-strongarmy of German trade unionists—namely, the Social-Demo-cratic trade unions—this member of the Social-Democratic group in the German Reichstag, delivered a purely liberal,bourgeois speech. 
 Needless to say, not a single liberal, noteven an Octobrist, would hesitate to subscribe to a speechabout “peace” and “culture”. 
 And when German socialists remarked that this was not a Social-Democratic speech, this “leader” of capital’s wage-slaves treated them with scathing contempt. 
 What are “edi-tors” compared to a “practical politician” and collectorof workers’ pennies! Our philistine Narcissus has the samecontempt for editors as the police panjandrums in a certaincountry have for the third element. 
 129 “These editors” would no doubt have delivered a speech “against capitalism”. 
 Just think what this quasi-socialist is sneering at! He is sneering at the idea that a socialist should think it neces-sary to speak against capitalism. 
 To the “statesmen” of German opportunism such an idea is utterly alien; they talk in such a way as not to offend “capitalism ”. 
 Disgracing themselves by this servile renunciation of socialism, theybrag of their disgrace. 
 Legien is not just anybody. 
 He is a representative of the army of trade unions, or rather, the officers’ corps ofthat army. 
 His speech was no accident, no slip of the tongue, no casual whimsy, no blunder of a provincial German office clerk overawed by American capitalists, who were politeand revealed no trace of police arrogance. 
 If it were only this, Legien’s speech would not be worthy of note. 
 But it was obviously not that. 
At the International Congress in Stuttgart, half the Ger-man delegation turned out to be sham socialists of this type, who voted for the ultra-opportunist resolution on the co-lonial question. 
 130 Take the German magazine Sozialistische (??) Monats-hefte131 and you will always find in it utterances by men like Legien, which are thoroughly opportunist, and have nothing in common with socialism, utterances touching on all the vital issues of the labour movement. 
 The “official” explanation of the “official” German party is that “nobody reads” Sozialistische Monatshefte , that it has no influence, etc. 
; but that is not true . 
 The Stuttgart “incident” proved that it is not true. 
 The most prominent and responsible people, members of parliament and tradeunion leaders who write for Sozialistische Monatshefte , constantly and undeviatingly propagate their views amongthe masses. 
 The “official optimism” of the German party has long been noted in its own camp by those people who earned Legien’s appellation of “these editors”—an appellation con-temptuous from the point of view of the bourgeois andhonourable from the point of view of a socialist. 
 And themore often the liberals and the liquidators in Russia (includ-ing Trotsky, of course) attempt to transplant this amiable characteristic to our soil , the more determinedly must they be resisted. 
 German Social-Democracy has many great services to its credit. 
 Thanks to Marx’s struggle against all the Höch-bergs, Dührings, and Co. 
, it possesses a strictly formulatedtheory, which our Narodniks vainly try to evade or touch up along opportunist lines. 
 It has a mass organisation, newspapers, trade unions, political associations—thatsame mass organisation which is so definitely buildingup in our country in the shape of the victories the Pravda Marxists are winning everywhere—in Duma elections, in thedaily press, in Insurance Board elections, and in the trade unions. 
 The attempts of our liquidators, whom the workers have “removed from office”, to evade the question of thegrowth of this mass organisation in Russia in a form adapt-ed to Russian conditions are as vain as those of the Narod-niks, and imply a similar intellectualist breakaway from the working-class movement. 
 But the merits of German Social-Democracy are merits, not because of shameful speeches like those delivered byLegien or the “utterances” (in the press) by the contribu-tors to Sozialistische Monatshefte , but despite them. 
 We must not try to play down the disease which the German party is undoubtedly suffering from, and which reveals itself in phenomena of this kind; nor must we play it down with“officially optimistic” phrases. 
 We must lay it bare to theRussian workers, so that we may learn from the experienceof the older movement, learn what should not be copiedfrom it.

 BOOK REVIEW N. 
 A. 
 Rubakin, Among Books , Vol. 
 II. 
 Nauka Publishers, Moscow, 1913. 
 Price 4 rubles. 
 Second Edition This bulky tome of 930 large pages of very small type, printed partly in double columns, is an “attempt to review Russian book treasures in connection with the history ofscientific-philosophical and literary-social ideas”. 
 Thusruns the subtitle of the book. 
 The second volume, which we are here reviewing, covers the various fields of the social sciences. 
 This includes, among others, socialism in Western Europe as well as in Russia. 
 A publication of this type is obviously of greatinterest, and the author’s plan is on the whole a correctone. 
 It is really impossible to give a sensible “review of Russian book treasures” and a “work of reference” for self-education and libraries otherwise than in connection with the history of ideas. 
 What is needed here is “preliminary remarks” to every section (these the author provides) witha general survey of the subject and an accurate summaryof each ideological trend, as well as a list of books for the particular section and for each ideological trend. 
 The author and his numerous collaborators, as mentioned in the preface, have expended an enormous amount of labour and started an extremely valuable undertaking, which de-serves from us the cordial wish that it may grow and developin scope and depth. 
 Very valuable, among other things, isthe fact that the author excludes neither foreign publica-tions nor publications that have been prosecuted. 
 No decent library can dispense with Mr. 
 Rubakin’s work. 
 The faults of this book are its author’s eclecticism and the fact that he does not sufficiently enlist, or rather, that he has barely begun to enlist, the co-operation of specialists on definite subjects. 
 The first fault is perhaps due to the author’s peculiar aversion for “polemics”. 
 In his preface, Mr. 
 Rubakin says:“Never in my life have I taken part in any polemics, for Ibelieve that in the overwhelming majority of cases polemicsare one of the best means of obscuring the truth with allsorts of human emotions. 
” The author does not realise, for one thing, that there has never been, nor can there be, any human search for truth without “human emotions”. 
 The author forgets, secondly, that he has set out to review “thehistory of ideas”, and the history of ideas is that of the suc-cession, and consequently of the conflict of ideas. 
 One of the two— either we ignore the conflict of ideas, in which case it is rather difficult to undertake a review of its history (let alone participate in this conflict), or else we abandon the claim “never to take part in any polemics”. 
For example: I turn to Mr. 
 Rubakin’s “preliminary remarks”on the theory of political economy and at once see that theauthor escapes from this dilemma firstly by means of veiled polemics (a form that has all the demerits of polemics and none of its great merits), and, secondly, by defending eclec-ticism. 
 In his outline of Bogdanov’s Short Course , Mr. 
 Rubakin ventures” to note the “interesting” similarity betweenone of the deductions made by the “Marxist” author and “N. 
 K. 
 Mikhailovsky’s well-known formula of progress” (p. 
 815). 
 O, Mr. 
 Rubakin, who says, “Never in my life have I taken part in any polemics” .... 
 On the preceding page he eulogises the “strictly scien-tific method, profound analysis and critical attitude to-wards extremely important theories” of—who would you think?—that exemplary eclecticist Mr. 
 Tugan-Baranovsky!Mr. 
 Rubakin himself is compelled to admit that this profes-sor is somewhat of an adherent of Marxism, somewhat of anadherent of Narodism and somewhat of an adherent of the“theory of marginal utility”, 132 and yet calls him a “so-cialist”! Does not writing a monstrous thing like this amount to indulging in polemics of the worst kind against social -ism? Had Mr. 
 Rubakin divided the 14,000 odd words (i. 
e. 
, a whole pamphlet) which he wrote as an introduction to the literature on political economy, into four parts, and had he arranged to have them written by, say, a Black-Hundred-man, a liberal, a Narodnik, and a Marxist, we would have hada more public polemic, and 999 readers out of a thousand would have discovered the truth a thousand times more easily andquickly. 
 Mr. 
 Rubakin has resorted to this kind of device—that of enlisting the co-operation of representatives of “polemics”—in the question of Bolshevism and Menshevism, and devotedhalf a page to me * and another half to L. 
 Martov. 
 As far as I am concerned, I am quite satisfied with L. 
 Martov’s ex-position, for example, with his admission that liquidationism amounts to attempts “at creating a legal workers’ party”, and to “a negative attitude to surviving underground organ-isations” (pp. 
 771-72), or with his admission that “Menshe-vism saw no other way in which the proletariat could takea useful part in the crisis” (i. 
e. 
, that of 1905) “except by help-ing the bourgeois liberal democrats in their attempts to eject the reactionary section of the propertied classes from political power—but while rendering this assistance, theproletariat was to maintain its complete political inde-pendence” (772). 
 As soon as Mr. 
 Rubakin continues this outline of Men-shevism on his own, he falls into error—for example, his assertion that Axelrod “ withdrew ” from liquidationism to-gether with Plekhanov (772). 
 While we do not blame Mr. 
 Ru-bakin very much for such errors, which are inevitable in theinitial stages of a work of this varied and compilatory na-ture, yet we cannot help wishing that the author would moreoften employ the method of enlisting the co-operation of representatives of the different trends in all fields of knowl-edge. 
 This would make for greater accuracy and complete-ness of the work, as well as for its impartiality ; only eclecti-cism and veiled polemics stand to lose by this.

 LIQUIDATIONISM DEFINED Readers of our paper are aware what a great deal of con-troversy and conflict liquidationism is causing in the workingclass movement of Russia today. 
 We have repeatedly pointedout that every class-conscious worker (in a sense, we would even say every politically-conscious democrat) must have a clear and definite understanding of liquidationism. 
 Nonetheless, our opponents in both Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta and Nasha Zarya not only fail to publish in full and explain to their readers the gist of the official decisionsdealing with liquidationism (for example, from the texts of 1908 and 1910), but, what is far worse and far more harmful, they either flatly “deny” the existence of liquidationism,or else mouth incoherent irrelevancies, instead of accurately reporting the decision unanimously adopted in 1910. 
 We therefore consider it necessary to take advantage of such a rare occasion as that afforded by L. 
 Martov him-self, who has given in the press an astonishingly (for this writer) exact and truthful definition or description ofliquidationism. 
 In Volume II of N. 
 Rubakin’s well-known book Among Books (second edition, Moscow, 1913, p. 
 771) we find that Mr. 
 Rubakin has published without the slightest alteration a letter from L. 
 Martov replying to Mr. 
 Rubakin’s request “to set forth the gist and history of Menshevism”. 
 In this letterL. 
 Martov writes literally the following: “After the social movement was crushed, the same tendency of the Mensheviks [namely, the tendency “to start party construction anew in a more definite class-socialist spirit or to give Social-Democ-racy a new basis for its radical self-reformation”] towards the organ-isational reform of the Party found expression in increased activities aimed at the formation of all kinds of non-party labour organisations— trade unions, self-education societies (in some cases, co-operative societies), etc. 
, and in attempts , through these societies , to form a legal workers’ party , or organised outposts of it [in the course of the con-troversy, those who took part in these attempts were dubbed “legalists”or “liquidators ” because of their negative attitude towards the surviving underground organisations ]. 
” This is all that Martov had to say about liquidationism. 
 We have underlined the principal passages. 
 We shall notdwell on the minor misstatement that it was only “in the course of the controversy” and that only “those who took part in these attempts” who were called liquidators; as amatter of fact, the general Marxist, official decision of1908, which is binding on all Marxists, speaks of liquida-tionism as a definite trend. 
 But that is a relatively minorpoint. 
 The major point is that L. 
 Martov has here unwittingly revealed that he understands and knows what liquidation-ism is. 
 Attempts to form a legal workers’ party and of course advocacy and defence of this idea; a negative attitude to-wards the organisations of the “old type” which still sur-vive (and, naturally, may arise anew)—such is the crux of the matter, which Nasha Zarya , Luch , and Severnaya Rabo-chaya Gazeta have tried a thousand times to confuse, obscure and deny. 
 The reader who gives thought to the significance of the facts we have quoted will realise why the mere mention of “unity” by the liquidators is capable of arousing, in class-conscious workers, either violent indignation and protest,or (according to their mood) scathing ridicule. 
 One can con-ceive of an advocate of the legal-party idea sincerely andhonestly repudiating the “underground”, if those are hisconvictions. 
 But one cannot conceive of sincere and honest talk about “unity” on the part of those who contribute to Nasha Zarya or Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta . 
 To write for these journals means, in effect , to fight against the “under-ground” and for a legal party, which they continue to advo-cate and stand up for. 
 Therefore, when the International Socialist Bureau, in December 1913, brought up the question of ascertaining theconditions on which unity could be achieved in Russia, theorganised Marxists in St. 
 Petersburg and Moscow at once publicly declared that the primary and basic condition was emphatic and unqualified rejection of liquidationism, a complete and radical change in the entire trend of the Nasha Zarya and Luch group. 
 The Luch people answered, also publicly (both F. 
 D. 
 and L. 
 M. 
), that they did notagree with this. 
 That being the case, it is obvious that people who talk about “unity” with this group, which persists in its liberal ideas, are deceiving both themselves and others. 
 Real unity has already been developed and will continue to be developedamong the majority of the class-conscious workers, who haverallied round the Marxist decisions and round the entireMarxist body, against this splitting group.

 73, Published according to April 29, 1914 the text in Put Pravdy CONCLUDING REMARKS TO THE SYMPOSIUM ISM AND LIQUIDATIONISM Liquidationism is an issue of vital importance, not only to labour democracy but to Russian democracy generally. 
 When our democratic press tries to sidestep this issue, or skim over it as a “private controversy” among Marxists,it merely reveals a desire to evade an appraisal of the car-dinal political problems of our day. 
 For the question ofliquidationism is one of our entire appraisal of the JuneThird system, and, in broader terms, of our counter-revolu-tion generally. 
 It is a question of the basic tasks and methods of the democrats. 
 No one, I believe, has questioned the fact that the lat-est period of Russian history, beginning approximatelywith 1908, has been marked not only by the extreme inten-sification of reaction’s persecution of everything democratic, but by profound ideological disunity and disintegration, which has affected the proletariat as well as all bourgeois-democratic elements. 
 But whereas everyone acknowledges this obvious fact, only the Marxists have set themselvesthe clear and immediate task of precisely defining the class roots and class implications of this disunity and disinteg-ration. 
 Without such a definition there can be no conscious choice of tactics. 
 Work in that direction started in our Marxist press abroad in 1908, i. 
e. 
, as soon as disunity became a fact. 
 The Marx-ists could not accept this disunity, as the liberals had done,nor could they confine themselves to subjectively condemn-ing it, as even the best (in the democratic sense) of the Narodniks had done. 
 The social trends called for a socio-economic, i. 
e. 
, class explanation. 
 December 1908 saw an explanation of the substance of liquidationism given in the Bolshevik press and endorsed by a Party decision which was binding on all. 
 The spring of 1909 saw a formal break between the Bolsheviks (as repre-sented by their leading body) and the so-called Vperyodists, * who accepted otzovism133 or considered it a “legitimate trend” and defended “god-building” and the reactionaryphilosophy of Machism. 
 ** This break revealed the main fea-tures of “Left liquidationism”, its leaning towards anarch-ism, just as Right liquidationism, or liquidationism proper,leans towards liberalism. 
 By January 1910 this Marxist analysis of the present disunity and disintegration, nine-tenths of which had beengiven by the Bolshevik press abroad, was so complete and the facts so irrefutably established, that all Marxists, representatives of all trends (including both the liquidators and the Vperyodists) were compelled unanimously to ack-nowledge, in the decisions of January 1910, that both theliquidationist and Vperyodist “deviations” were manifesta-tions of bourgeois influence on the proletariat. 
 A glance at the situation in the non-Marxist movement will be enough to make one realise the social significanceof this Marxist analysis and Marxist decision. 
 Among theliberals we find the extreme Vekhist liquidationism and con-fusion, which persists to this day , on the question of whether the methods of 1905 have been abandoned or not. 
 Among the Left Narodniks we find extreme liquidationist pronounce-ments, beginning with the Paris publications of 1908-11,the nebulous liquidationism of Pochin 134 and ending with the liquidationist mouthings of Savinkov-Ropshin and Chernovin Zavety . 
 On the other hand, the Left Narodniks’ official otzovism continues to erode and weaken their ranks. 
 The objective validity of the Marxist analysis was confirmed by the fact that in the course of the five oddyears since 1908 all progressive trends of social thought have been constantly coming up against these selfsame liqui-dationist and Narodnik errors, these selfsame questions of applying old methods to the solution of old but still *Alexinsky, Bogdanov, Lunacharsky, S. 
 Volsky and others.

 unresolved problems, and of marshalling our forces in a new situation and with new methods. 
 At the beginning of the June Third period, Marxist analysis helped to reveal the theoretical deviations towards liquida-tionism and otzovism. 
 Now, at the close of the period, we seehow, even in the open arena, in full sight of everybody,the vast majority of class-conscious workers of Russia haverallied around the Marxists, while both flanks of the demo-cratic press, which seeks to influence the proletariat, are preoccupied with petty-bourgeois liquidationism and petty-bourgeois Narodism. 
 Not so long ago the Left-Narodnik Severnaya Mysl (No. 
 1) carried the following report from a Mr. 
 Braines on the social insurance campaign in Riga: “The boycottist trend is apparent only among the shoemakers, where boycottist groups have been formed. 
 Unfortunately, the Na-rodniks are the leading spirits in these groups. 
” (Quoted in the article“Narodism and Liquidationism as Disintegrating Elements in theWorking-Class Movement”, * in Proletarskaya Pravda No. 
 12, for December 20, 1913. 
) The same paper had to admit that: “To the honour of the Marxists be it said that they enjoy consid-erable influence at present in the unions [i. 
e. 
, the trade unions] whereas we Left Narodniks work in them without a definite plan, and for that reason our influence is scarcely felt. 
” (Ibid. 
) The doctrinal feebleness of the Left Narodniks, who combine the new-fangled opportunism of the European philis-tines with the purely Russian philistine defence of “labouring”proprietors, is naturally complemented by tactical feeble-ness and vacillation. 
 Nothing remains of the old Left-Narod-nik party except vacillation, and the same applies to the liquidators. 
 Defeated in the working-class movement, these petty-bourgeois trends had no choice but to form a bloc against the Marxists. 
 It has been a steady descent. 
 From advocacy of a legal party, from the speeches of the Potresovs and the Yushke-viches, with their renouncement of the idea of hegemony and of Marxism, the liquidators have sunk to a direct struggle against the Marxist party. 
 Here is what a St. 
 PetersburgLeft Narodnik wrote the other day in Stoikaya Mysl ( No. 
 5) : *See pp. 
 59-62 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 “As soon as we came into the hall (where the election of the In-surance Board was taking place) the narrow factional stand takenby the Pravdists at once became clear. 
 But we do not lose hope. 
Together with the liquidators we are drawing up a non-factionallist that will give us one seat on the Board and two alternate seats. 
(Quoted from Put Pravdy No. 
 38, for March 16, 1914. 
) Petty-bourgeois democrats of all trends who wish to corrupt the workers with bourgeois influence—unite against the Marxists! The silly word “non-factional”, which fasci-nates people who are incapable of thinking and learning,is so convenient and pleasing a word for the philistine!But the bloc with the Left Narodniks was no help to thepoor liquidators, and never can be. 
 The class-conscious workers elected to the Insurance Board only Marxists, op-ponents of liquidationism. 
 Grouplets of non-Party intellectuals, who seek to subject the workers to bourgeois policy and bourgeois ideology,have now taken definite shape in Russia: the liquidatorsand the Left Narodniks. 
 For nearly twenty years, ever since Economism first appeared on the scene (1894-95), the ground has been laid for this alliance of opportunists from among the near-Party Marxists with the Narodniksagainst consistent Marxism. 
 It is high time to face the facts squarely and say firmly and emphatically: the Marx-ist working-class movement in Russia is being built, and can be built, only in a struggle against liquidationism and Narodism. 
 All over the world, in every capitalist society, the pro-letariat is inevitably connected with the petty bourgeoisieby a thousand ties, and everywhere the period of formation ofworkers’ parties was attended by its more or less prolonged and persistent ideological and political subjection to the bourgeoisie. 
 This is common to all capitalist countries, but itassumes different forms in different countries, dependingon historical and economic factors. 
 In Britain, in conditionsof complete political freedom and with the country enjoyinga long period of monopoly, the liberal bourgeoisie was for decades able to corrupt and ideologically enslave the majority of class-conscious workers. 
 In France, the traditionsof republican petty-bourgeois radicalism have been convert-ing very many workers into supporters of the “Radical” bourgeois party, or of equally bourgeois anarchism. 
 In Ger-many, half a century ago, the workers still followed the liberal Schulze-Delitzsch and were taken in by the “national-liberal” (“Royal-Prussian”) opportunistic vacillation ofLassalle and Schweitzer, while today hundreds of thousandsof workers follow the Catholic “centre”, with its sham “democ-racy”. 
 In Russia, the bourgeois-democratic solution of the peas-ant question has not been completed to this day. 
 It is therefore not surprising to see petty-bourgeois Narodismparading as “socialism”. 
 Russia is the most petty bourgeois of all capitalist countries. 
 Consequently, as soon as Marx-ism became a mass social trend in Russia, intellectualist petty-bourgeois opportunism made itself felt, first in the form of Economism and “legal Marxism” (1895-1902), later in the form of Menshevism * (1903-08), and finally in the form of liquidationism (1908-14). 
 Liquidationism has now reached full maturity, a com-plete break with the Marxist workers’ party. 
 If Mr. 
 L. 
 M. 
,the most “Left” of the liquidators—and the most adroit in producing evasive formulas—writes: “experience has shown that the ‘legal workers’ party’ is not a reac-tionary dream, for such a party , in a certain sense , exists in Russia at present...” (L. 
 M. 
’s italics; Nasha Zarya No. 
 2, 1914, p. 
 83), then it should be clear to all that it is absurd and prepos-terous even to think of the possibility of “uniting” or “re-conciling” such a group with the Marxist workers’ party. 
 Only hopelessly empty-headed people can now talk of the Marxist workers’ party “uniting” with such a group, with that of Nasha Zarya and Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta group. 
 *The liquidationist historians present a ludicrous spectacle indeed when they have to dodge and manoeuvre in order to disguise the unpleasant but irrefutable fact that Menshevism (and liquida-tionism even more so) emerged from the very Economism, Bundism and “legal Marxism” against which the old Iskra , builder of the working-class party in Russia, fought for three years . 
 See, for instance, Mr. 
 Potresov’s pamphlet on Axelrod. 
 Mr. 
 Potresov has tried justas zealously and just as unsuccessfully to disguise and conceal the fact that in his “Zemstvo campaign plan” 135 Axelrod urged us not to frighten the liberals away. 
 Incidentally, even the Menshevik Ple-khanov has fully admitted the historical (in addition to theoretical)kinship between liquidationism, and Economism and “legal Marxism”. 
 Class divisions in Russia in 1914 are in every respect more politically definite and sharper than they were in 1904. 
 At that time it was only the landed nobility that showed no cleavage, and the salon liberalism of some of its repre-sentatives frightened even the old regime. 
 At that time, thisregime considered the muzhik such a reliable pillar of lawand order that it allowed him a very large measure of influ-ence in the Bulygin and Witte Dumas. 
 136 At that time, Guchkov-Milyukov-Peshekhonov liberalism and democracy could still present a single and uniform school of thought. 
 Atthat time Menshevism wanted to be—and in effect was—aninner -Party trend, one that sought to defend opportunist slogans in “programmatic discussions” within the workers’ party. 
 Present-day liquidationism has since then moved miles to the right. 
 It has quitted the Party, shaken the dust ofthe “underground” from its feet, and is a closely knit anti-partyist centre of journalists writing for the legal liberal andliquidationist press, men whom the workers have removedfrom every office in all working-class organisations and socie-ties. 
 To compare this liquidationism with the Menshevism of 1903-07 is to allow oneself to be blinded and deafenedby old names and catchwords, and to have absolutely nounderstanding of the evolution of class and party relationsin Russia during the past ten years. 
 Present-day liquidationism, that of 1914, is the same as the Tovarishch group of 1907. 
 137 It is quite natural that in exile and emigration, where people are so out of touch with real conditions, so immuredin memories of the past, of the events of seven or ten yearsago, one comes across dozens of these “have-beens”, whodream of “unity” between the workers’ party and the group of Messrs. 
 L. 
 M. 
, F. 
 D. 
, Potresov, Yezhov, Sedov and Co. 
 And there are also very many of these “have-beens”, but ofa poorer moral calibre, among intellectuals associatedwith the workers’ party in 1904-07 and now holding “cushyjobs” in various legal organisations. 
 No less natural is it that among Russian working-class youth of today all these dreams and all this talk of com-placent individuals about “unity” of liquidators and theworkers’ party produce either Homeric and most impolite laughter, or else bewilderment and pity for these intellec-tualist Manilovs. 
 This is perfectly natural, for our pres-ent-day working-class youth have seen the liquidators desert the Party, seen their flight from the “defunct Party cells”, heard their renegade speeches about the “underground” and the harmfulness of “boosting the illegal Press” (see state-ment in Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta , March 13, 1914), have been obliged to combat the bloc of this gentry both with the Narodniks and with the non-party element at a numberof congresses, in the elections to the Fourth Duma, at anumber of meetings of workers’ societies, and in the elec-tions to the Insurance Board, and have been obliged toremove these individuals from office in every workers’ or-ganisation. 
 Let Trotsky, in Borba , cast imploring looks at Skobelev and Chkheidze; let contributors to the Paris newspaper Za Partiy u *138 look with hope and trust to Buryano v139; let them reiterate all this talk about “unity”—their wordsnow have a ring of sadness and irrelevancy. 
 To preach “unity” between Marxists and people who claim that a “legal workers’ party is not a reactionary dream”,etc. 
, one has to be either fantastically stupid, or else haveno knowledge and no understanding whatever of the Russianworking-class movement and of the position in the localorganisations, or else one has to long for such a pleasant“pendulum” state of affairs in which—who knows!—Trotsky (or some other “non-factionalist”) will be invited to engineer “non-factional” unity “on an equal basis” between the groupthat contribute to Nasha Zarya , Dyen and Kievskaya Mysl and the groups of Marxist workers. 
 What a sweet and de-lightful prospect! But real life, the real history of the attempts to “unite” with the liquidators, reveals something very far removedfrom this sweet and delightful prospect. 
 There was a se-rious and concerted effort to unite with the liquidators inJanuary 1910, but it was wrecked by the liquidators. 
 Therewas unity of all groups and grouplets with the liquidators against the hateful Conference of January 1912. 
 This was *Plekhanov. 
 ardent and passionate unity based on the most passionate (and violently abusive) invective against that Conference, with both Trotsky and the Za Partiyu contributors and, of course, all the Vperyodists taking part in this “union”. 
 Ifthe evil Leninist splitters were really an obstacle to unity,then real unity would have blossomed forth immediatelyafter the joint statement against the Leninists, which thesegroups and the liquidators published in Vorwärts in March 1912! But, alas, these queer unity-builders have since then— since the workers in Russia, having inaugurated Pravda in April, proceeded to unite the hundreds and thousands ofworkers’ groups in all parts of the country on a basis ofloyalty to the Party—these queer unity-builders have, ever since March 1912, displayed ever greater disunity amongst themselves! By August 1912 the famous “Augustbloc” of the liquidators was formed without the Vperyodists and without “Za Partiyu ”. 
 The next eighteen months saw the growth, maturity and ultimate consolidation of the unity of workers’ groups in Russia, in all legal working-class societies, in all the trade unions and organisations and in a good many newspapersand organs, with the Russian Social-Democratic Labourgroup in the Duma, which is prepared to carry out thewill of the majority of the workers. 
 But what of our “unity-builders”? Oh, their “unity” efforts have been so felicitous and successful that instead of one Vperyod group there are now two (not counting Bogdanov, the empirio-monist whomsome take for a third Vperyod group 140); instead of a single Trotsky-and-liquidator paper ( Luch ), there is now, in addition, Trotsky’s own organ, Borba , which this time prom-ises genuine “non-factionalism”. 
 And besides Trotsky’s timid withdrawal from the liquidator ranks, there hasbeen a complete and resolute withdrawal from them ofall the organised Lettish Marxists , who, despite their strict neutrality and non-factionalism, forthrightly declared attheir 1914 Congress: “The conciliators (participants in the August bloc ) have themselves fallen into ideological and political dependenceon the liquidators ”! From March 1912, when everyone united with the liquida-tors against the evil “Leninist splitters”, up to March 1914, when the fictitious “August bloc” finally fell to pieces, it became abundantly clear that the real unity of theMarxist workers (in Russia, not in Paris or Vienna) is pro-ceeding, and will only proceed, in opposition to the liquida-tionist group and regardless of the empty talk about “unity” with the advocates of a “legal workers’ party”. 
 Thousands of workers’ groups openly, and publicly rally-ing around the Marxist paper—here is living proof of gen-uine unity and its development. 
 Based on the principlesevolved by the Marxists at the beginning of the June Thirdperiod, this unity has enabled us—a hundredfold moresuccessfully than anyone else has done—to utilise every legal opportunity, to utilise it in the spirit of a ruthless war against the ideas that condemn the “boosting of the illegalpress”, or accept advocacy of “a legal party”, or renouncehegemony, or relegate to the background the “pillars”, 141 etc. 
, etc. 
 And only such unity, based on these principles, indi-cates the correct path to the Russian working class.

 Priboi Publishers St. 
 Petersburg MORE ABOUT THE POLITICAL CRISIS A good deal has already been said in the newspapers about the famous Duma session of April 22 at which all theSocial-Democrats and Trudoviks were ejected. 
 142 However, the full implications of this event have not yet been suf-ficiently explained. 
 Every political crisis, whatever its outcome, is use-ful in that it brings to light things that have been hidden,reveals the forces operating in politics, exposes decep-tion and self-deception, catch-phrases and fictions, andaffords striking demonstration of “ things as they are ”, by forcibly driving them home. 
 All the democratic members of the Duma, both Social-Democrats and Trudoviks, were suspended for fifteen ses-sions and ejected, most of them by armed force. 
 This wasdone in deference to those who, by taking measures againstChkheidze, clearly revealed their “firm” intention of tak-ing a step (or rather, a dozen steps at once) towards the right. 
 The Rights and Octobrists, plus some of the Pro-gressists , i. 
e. 
, the bourgeois liberals, who are in close, in fact, inseparable league with the Cadets, voted for thisejection. 
 The Cadets abstained! This abstention by a party which claims to be democratic admirably revealed—by no means for the first time—the true nature of the Cadet gentry’sliberalism. 
 The Fourth Duma prepares to expel Chkheidze,then the other Social-Democrats, and then all the democrats,and starts by suspending them, yet the “leaders” of the liber-al opposition abstain from voting ! No matter how many gallons of ink the liberals and Cadets may afterwards use up to invent sophisms and evasions such as: we merely dis-approved of the “form” of the Social-Democrats’ speeches, etc. 
—the crux of the matter will remain clear to anybody who does not wish to deceive himself. 
 Abstaining from voting when Goremykin, Rodzyanko and their majority expelled the democratic deputies actuallyimplied tacit support, moral approval and political endorse-ment of Goremykin and Rodzyanko and their majority. 
 One cannot agree with the point of view expressed by L. 
 M. 
 in Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta , No. 
 61, who wrote that the “Duma majority headed by the Octobrists have com-mitted political suicide”. 
 That is the point of view of a Leftliberal, not of a democrat, and certainly not of a Social-Democrat. 
 The Duma majority and the Octobrists have not commit-ted suicide at all. 
 All of them are deliberate counter-revo-lutionaries, deliberate participants in the June Third bloc and in the Stolypin system, deliberate enemies ofdemocracy. 
 Since they recognise Goremykin as their politi-cal leader, why is it suicide for them to follow this leaderagainst their class enemies, against the representativesof democracy, who are notoriously hostile to the Octob-rists? What is the purpose of these turgid and utterly false phrases about “suicide”? Such phrases assume that the Octobrists are not the enemies of democracy, i. 
e. 
, assume something that is disgustingly false. 
 These phrases resemblethe vulgar democratism of those misguided Left Narod-niks who often shouted that the Third and the Fourth Duma were a “pasteboard” institution, a house of cards. 
 The Octob-rists’ vote for Goremykin, Maklakov and Shcheglovitovcould have been considered suicidal only if the Octobristshad expressed the “will of the people”. 
 Actually, however,they express the “ will” of those sections of the big bourgeoi-sie and the landlords which stand in mortal fear of the people. 
 No, let us face the truth squarely. 
 In politics that is al-ways the best and the only correct attitude. 
 And the truth is that the Duma events of April 22 shat-tered and killed the remnants of constitutional and legalis-tic illusions The counter-revolutionary bloc of Purishke-vich, Rodzyanko and the “Left” Octobrists, plus a sectionof the Progressists, came out against democracy bluntly, openly , determinedly, in soldier fashion (not in the meta-phorical, but in the literal sense of this last term, for soldiers were called into the Duma). 
 The counter-revolutionary liberals, Milyukov and Co. 
, abstained from voting . 
 This could only have been expected after all that has happenedin the Third and the Fourth Duma, after all that happenedin the first decade of the twentieth century. 
 Well, the less self-deception there is, the better for the people. 
 What has the country gained from the Duma events of April 22? It has gained by losing another particle of illu-sions that are detrimental to the cause of freedom in thiscountry. 
 Put Pravdy No. 
 76, Published according to May 3, 1914 the text in Put Pravdy THE IDEOLOGICAL STRUGGLE IN THE WORKING-CLASS MOVEMENT The profound ideological change that has taken place among the opposition , or progressive, sections of the people is an extremely important and distinctive feature of post-revolutionary Russia. 
 To forget this distinctive feature is to prevent oneself from understanding the Russian revolu-tion and its character, as well as the tasks of the workingclass in our time. 
 The ideological change among the liberal bourgeoisie is expressed in the rise of an anti-democratic trend (Struve, Izgoyev and V. 
 Maklakov openly, the rest of the Cadets secretly, “bashfully”). 
 Among the democrats this change is expressed in the utter ideological confusion and vacillation that prevailamong both the Social-Democrats (proletarian democrats)and the Socialist-Revolutionaries (bourgeois democrats). 
 Even the best representatives of democracy confine them-selves to bewailing this confusion, vacillation and back-sliding. 
 The Marxists, however, look for the class roots of this social phenomenon. 
 The chief symptom of this break-down is liquidationism, which as far back as 1908 was officially defined as “an attempt by a certain part of the intelligentsia to liqui-date” the “underground”, and to “substitute” for it a legalworkers’ party, a definition that was endorsed by “theentire Marxist body”. 
 143 At the last official meeting of leading Marxists held in January 1910, which was attendedby representatives of all “trends” and groups, there was not a single person who protested against the condemnation of liquidationism as a manifestation of bourgeois influence on the proletariat . 
 This condemnation, which was also an explanation of the class roots of liquidationism, was adopted unanimously . 
 Over four years have passed since then, and the vast experience of the mass working-class movement has provideda thousand proofs that this appraisal of liquidationism iscorrect. 
 The facts have shown that, between them, the theory of Marxism and the practical experience of the mass working-class movement have killed liquidationism, which is a bourgeois and anti-workers’ trend. 
 It is sufficient to recallhow, in a single month, March 1914, Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta vilified the “illegal press” (issue of March 13), and demonstrations (Mr. 
 Gorsky in the issue of April 11), andhow Bulkin, in perfect imitation of the liberals, vilified the “underground” ( Nasha Zarya No. 
 3), how the notorious L. 
 M. 
 , on behalf of the editors of Nasha Zarya , fully sup-ported Bulkin on this point and argued the case for “build-ing a legal workers’ party”—it is sufficient to recall allthis to understand why the attitude of the class-consciousworkers towards liquidationism cannot be anything else than that of ruthless condemnation and complete boycott of the liquidators. 
 But here a very important question crops up: How did this trend arise historically? It arose in the course of the twenty years ’ history of Marx-ism’s ties with the mass working-class movement in Rus-sia. 
 Up to 1894-95 there were no such ties. 
 The Emanci-pation of Labour group only laid the theoretical foundations for the Social-Democratic movement and took the first step towards the working-class movement. 
 It was only the propaganda of 1894-95 and the strikes of 1895-96 that established firm and inseverable ties between Social-Democracy and the mass working-class movement. 
 And immediately an ideological struggle commenced between the two trends of Marxism: the struggle between the Econo-mists and the consistent Marxists or (later) Iskrists (1895-1902), the struggle between the Mensheviks and Bolsheviks (1903-08), and the struggle between the liquidators and the Marxists (1908-14). 
 Economism and liquidationism are two different forms of the same petty-bourgeois, intellectualist opportunism that has existed for twenty years. 
 That there is a personal as well as ideological connection between all these forms of opportunism is an undoubted fact. 
 It is sufficient to men-tion the name of the leader of the Economists, A. 
 Martynov,who subsequently became a Menshevik and is now a liquida-tor. 
 It is sufficient to call a witness like G. 
 V. 
 Plekhanov,who, on very many points, * stood close to the Menshe-viks, but nevertheless openly admitted that the Mensheviks absorbed intellectualist opportunist elements into their ranks, and that the liquidators continued the errors of Econ-omism and were disrupters of the workers’ party. 
 People who (like the liquidators and Trotsky) ignore or falsify this twenty years’ history of the ideological strug-gle in the working-class movement do tremendous harm to the workers. 
 A worker who takes an anythingarian attitude towards the history of his own movement cannot be considered class-conscious. 
 Of all the capitalist countries, Russia is one ofthe most backward and most petty bourgeois. 
 That is whythe mass working-class movement gave rise to a petty-bour-geois, opportunist wing in that movement, not by chance, but inevitably. 
 The progress made during these twenty years in ridding the working-class movement of the influence of the bourgeoi-sie, of the influence of Economism and of liquidationism,has been tremendous . 
 For the first time, a real, proletarian foundation for a real Marxist party is being securely laid. 
 It is generally admitted, even the opponents of the Pravdists *Why do we say “on very many points”? Because Plekhanov occupied a special position, and departed from Menshevism many times: (1) at the 1903 Congress Plekhanov fought the opportunism of the Mensheviks, (2) after the Congress Plekhanov edited Nos. 
46-51 of Iskra , also in opposition to the Mensheviks, (3) in 1904 Plekhanov defended Axelrod’s plan for a Zemstvo campaign in sucha way that he passed over its chief mistakes in silence, (4) in thespring of 1905 Plekhanov left the Mensheviks, (5) in 1906, after the dissolution of the First Duma, the stand Plekhanov took was not at all a Menshevik one (see Proletary , 144 August 1906), (present edition, Vol. 
 11, pp. 
 179-83. 
—Ed. 
); (6) at the London Congress in1907—as Cherevanin relates—Plekhanov opposed the “organisationalanarchism” of the Mensheviks. 
 One must know these facts in orderto understand why the Menshevik Plekhanov so long and so resolutely fought liquidationism and denounced it. 
 are compelled to admit—the facts compel them to admit it!— that among class-conscious workers the Pravdists constitute the overwhelming majority. 
 What the Marxist “plenum” of January 1910 recognised theoretically (that liquidationism is “bourgeois influence on the proletariat”), the class-con-scious workers have been putting into practice during the pastfour years; they have secured practical recognition of itby weakening the liquidators, by removing them from office, by reducing liquidationism to a group of legal, opportunist publicists standing outside the mass working-class move-ment. 
 During this twenty-year-old conflict of ideas the working-class movement in Russia has been growing in scope andstrength and steadily maturing. 
 It has defeated Economism; the flower of the class-conscious proletariat have sided with the Iskrists. 
 At every decisive stage in the revolution theyhave left the Mensheviks in the minority: even Levitsky himself has had to admit that the masses of the workers sided with the Bolsheviks. 
 And, finally, it has now defeated liquidationism and, as a result, has taken the correct road of the broad strug-gle—illumined by Marxist theory and summed up in un-curtailed slogans—of the advanced class for the advancedhistorical aims of mankind.

 Written after May 6 (19), 1914 First published in 1937 Published according to in Lenin Miscellany XXX the manuscript “NEIGHBOURING SQUIRES ” There are certain winged words which most aptly express rather complex phenomena. 
 Among these should undoubt-edly be included the statement made by a certain landlord,member of the Right majority in the Duma, in connection with Goremykin’s speech during the historic session of Ap-ril 22. 
 “How nice it would be to have squire Goremykin for a neigh-bour! ” These words, uttered on the day the workers’ and peas-ants’ deputies were ejected from the Duma, are a very useful reminder now that these deputies have resumed their seats. 
 These words admirably describe the force which the demo-crats have to contend with within the Duma and outside it. 
 The petty squire who uttered these winged words spoke them in jest but he unwittingly voiced a truth that was moreserious and profound than he had intended. 
 Indeed, take the whole of this Fourth Duma, the whole of this majority of Rights and Octobrists, and all the “bigwigs” in the Coun-cil of State—what are they all if not “neighbouring squires”? In Russia 194 privy councillors own 3,103,579 dessia-tines of land, an average of over 20,000 dessiatines perprivy councillor. 
 And all the big landowners in Russia, numbering less than 30,000, own 70,000,000 dessiatines of land. 
 It is this class that forms the majority in the Duma,in the Council of State and among high government officials,to say nothing of the Zemstvo and local administrations. 
They are all “neighbouring quires”. 
 In our capitalist age these “neighbouring squires” are increasingly becoming factory owners, distillers, sugar manufacturers, and so forth; they are increasingly becomingshareholders in all kinds of commercial, industrial, financial, and railway undertakings. 
 The highest nobility are becoming closely interwoven with the big bourgeoisie. 
 These “neighbouring squires” are the best class organisa-tion in Russia, for they are organised, not only as neighbours,not only in associations, but also as a state force. 
 They occu-py all the most important institutions in the land, which arefashioned “in their own image”, to suit their own “needs”and interests. 
 True, our state system has very important features of its own, attributable to the military history of Russia, and so forth, features which may sometimes displeaseeven the class of the landed gentry. 
 Nevertheless, by and large,the Great-Russian landed gentry set a splendid pattern ofclass organisation! Our bourgeoisie make little use of this pattern. 
 They dare not think, for example, of organising their own class into a state power. 
 But the proletariat, organising as aclass, has never forgotten and never will forget the splend-id pattern set by the “neighbouring squires ”.... 
 Put Pravdy No. 
 80, Published according to May 8, 1914 the text in Put Pravdy THE NARODNIKS AND “FACTIONAL COERCION ” The more the working-class movement develops and the greater unity it shows in action, the louder do the intellec-tualist grouplets, who are isolated from the masses, shout about “factionalism”, “Pravdist contagion”, “factional blind-ness”, and so forth. 
 These people little suspect that in doingso they are issuing themselves with a testimonium pauper-tatis . 
 What they take for a sort of natural calamity, which can only be loudly bewailed, is really a sign of the maturityand consistency of our working-class movement. 
 Nothing has exposed the gross falsity of these intellec-tualist outcries against the workers’ “factionalism” so muchas the recent open elections of the workers’ insurance rep-resentatives. 
 Take the Narodnik newspaper Mysl Truda . 
 146 After all the insurance elections in St. 
 Petersburg are over, we read in the issue of that paper for April 20 a ranting article which, with a serious air, argues that on no account must there beany “yielding to the factional coercion [!] of the Pravdists”. 
 Factional coercion! What presumption on the part of this Narodnik paper to make such a demagogic statement! Just think, reader. 
 Open elections by the workers take place. 
 The workers hold an opinion poll among themselves as to the political trends of the participants. 
 The followingunchallenged figures of the political composition of theelectors are published for general information: Pravdists37, liquidators 7, Narodniks 4, and unspecified 5. 
 Theworkers, naturally, elect a majority of Pravdists. 
 (The minority, too, was represented—the Mensheviks, not the liquidators. 
) And after this the Narodnik newspaper makesan uproar about “factional coercion”. 
 You are simply making yourselves look ridiculous, Na-rodnik gentlemen. 
 What you have done is to clearly demon-strate how utterly meaningless that threadbare cliché “fac-tionalism” is. 
 You have overlooked two simple figures—37 and4. 
 Only 4 out of 53 worker electors were Narodniks, that is,a mere 7 per cent. 
 Apparently, the Narodniks think theworkers ought to elect their representatives not by a major-ity vote, but by a minority . 
 To please the Narodniks, 37 worker electors should have been equated with 4. 
 Thirty-seven equals four—that, strictly speaking, is what the good“non-factional” Narodniks are trying to din into the work-ers. 
 No wonder the workers cannot make head or tail ofthis profound Narodnik wisdom. 
 There is a limit to everything, “non-factional” Narodniks. 
 By shouting about the “factional coercion” of the majority when you have 4 electors out of 53 you are only proving onething, namely, that you do not respect the will of the major-ity, that in raving against “factionalism” you are trying tothwart the will of the vast majority of the workers . 
 You, and you alone, are actually trying to practice coercion of the overwhelming majority by an insignificant minority. 
 By pursuing the paltry and unprincipled policy of a co-terie that is isolated from the masses, you, with your rantingagainst “factional coercion”, are trying to act upon theworkers’ nerves and to extort from them, by this unbe-coming trick, satisfaction of your parochial interests. 
 If there is any “factionalism” of the worst possible kind, it is exemplified in the behaviour of the liquidator and Narodnikcircles, who are trying to thwart the will of the work-ers. 
 We see the same picture in connection with the insurance elections in so big a centre as Riga . 
 A meeting of the sick benefit societies is held to nominate candidates for the Gubernia Insurance Board. 
 Twenty-one sick benefit societies are represented. 
 There is asharp struggle of political trends. 
 On one side—the liqui-dators, Narodniks, non-party people and several trade uni-ons. 
 On the other—the Pravdists. 
 Lots of speakers from both sides take the floor. 
 In the end the Pravdist list of can-didates receives 44 votes, while the bloc of all the othersreceives 20. 
 (These figures are from the same source— Mysl Truda No. 
 2. 
) The Pravdists thus have a majority of over two-thirds. 
 After this the Narodniks again start their plaint about “factionalism” and “factional coercion”. 
 Notice the word-juggling. 
 The Narodniks, as we know, have never been a section of Social-Democracy. 
 The Narod-niks and the Social-Democrats have always been two sepa-rate parties , with programmes, tactics and organisations o~ their own. 
 The struggle between the Social-Democrats and the Narodniks is a struggle between political parties , not a struggle between sections of a party. 
 “Factionalism” hasnothing to do with it. 
 It is clear enough that in vociferating against “faction-alism” the liquidators and “conciliators” are merely play-ing into the hands of the enemies of the workers’ party, are merely sowing chaos and disunity, are confusing terms, andbamboozling the workers The outcry against “factionalism” has become a system. 
 The enemies of the Marxists are deliberately using it tobamboozle the workers. 
 When some decision adopted by the workers is not to the liking of some intellectual or group of intellectuals, the outcry is raised, “Help! ‘Factional-ism’! Help! ‘Factional coercion’!” You will astonish nobody with that sort of thing, gentle-men. 
 When the splitter and liberal, F. 
 D. 
, in Severnaya Likvidatorskaya Gazeta147 calls God to witness in every other line that he is for “unity”; when Trotsky in his super-intellectual highbrow mouthpiece rants about “factionalemancipation”; when the petty-bourgeois quasi-socialistsof Mysl Truda asseverate that they stand for unity, the workers tell them: whoever stands for true unity of the work-ing-class movement must submit to the majority of the class-conscious workers and not dare oppose the Marxist programme and Marxist tactics. 
 Put Pravdy No. 
 81, Published according to May 9, 1914 the text in Put Pravdy CORRUPTING THE WORKERS WITH REFINED NATIONALISM The more strongly the working-class movement develops the more frantic are the attempts by the bourgeoisie andthe feudalists to suppress it or break it up. 
 Both these methods—suppression by force and disintegration by bour-geois influence—are constantly employed all over the world,in all countries, and one or another of these methods isadopted alternately by the different parties of the rulingclasses. 
 In Russia, particularly after 1905, when the more intel-ligent members of the bourgeoisie realised that brute force alone was ineffective, all sorts of “progressive” bourgeoisparties and groups have been more and more often resortingto the method of dividing the workers by advocating differ-ent bourgeois ideas and doctrines designed to weaken thestruggle of the working class. 
 One such idea is refined nationalism, which advocates the division and splitting up of the proletariat on the mostplausible and specious pretexts, as for example, that ofprotecting the interests of “national culture”, “nationalautonomy, or independence”, and so on, and so forth. 
 The class-conscious workers fight hard against every kind of nationalism, both the crude, violent, Black-Hundred nationalism, and that most refined nationalism whichpreaches the equality of nations together with ... the splitting up of the workers’ cause, the workers’ organisations and the working-class movement according to nationality. 
 Unlike all the varieties of the nationalist bourgeoisie, the class-conscious workers, carrying out the decisions of the recent (summer 1913) conference of the Marxists, stand, not onlyfor the most complete, consistent and fully applied equality of nations and languages, but also for the amalgamation of the workers of the different nationalities in united pro-letarian organisations of every kind. 
 Herein lies the fundamental distinction between the national programme of Marxism and that of any bourgeoisie,be it the most “advanced”. 
 Recognition of the equality of nations and languages is important to Marxists, not only because they are the most consistent democrats. 
 The interests of proletarian solidarity and comradely unity in the workers’ class struggle call forthe fullest equality of nations with a view to removing everytrace of national distrust, estrangement, suspicion and enmi-ty. 
 And full equality implies the repudiation of all privi-leges for any one language and the recognition of the right of self-determination for all nations. 
 To the bourgeoisie, however, the demand for national equality very often amounts in practice to advocating na-tional exclusiveness and chauvinism; they very often coupleit with advocacy of the division and estrangement of nations. 
 This is absolutely incompatible with proletarian interna-tionalism , which advocates, not only closer relations be-tween nations, but the amalgamation of the workers of all nationalities in a given state in united proletarian organi-sations. 
 That is why Marxists emphatically condemn so-called “cultural-national autonomy”, i. 
e. 
, the idea thateducational affairs should be taken out of the hands of the state and transferred to the respective nationalities. 
 This plan means that in questions of “national culture” educa-tional affairs are to be split up in national associations accord-ing to the nationalities in the given state federation, eachwith its own separate Diet, educational budgets, school boards, and educational institutions. 
 This is a plan of refined nationalism, which corrupts and divides the working class. 
 To this plan (of the Bund-ists, liquidators and Narodniks, i. 
e. 
, of the various petty-bourgeois groups), the Marxists contrapose the principleof complete equality of nations and languages and go to theextent of denying the necessity of an official language; at the same time they advocate the closest possible relations between the nations, uniform state institutions for all na-tions, uniform school boards, a uniform education policy (secular education!) and the unity of the workers of the different nations in the struggle against the nationalism of every national bourgeoisie , a nationalism which is presented in the form of the slogan “national culture” for the purposeof deceiving simpletons. 
 Let the petty-bourgeois nationalists—the Bundists, the liquidators, the Narodniks and the writers for Dzvin —openly advocate their principle of refined bourgeois nationalism; that is their right. 
 But they should not try to fool the work-ers, as Madam V. 
 O. 
 148 does, for example, in issue No. 
 35 of Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta , where she assures her read-ers that Za Pravdu is opposed to instruction in schools being given in the native languages! That is gross slander. 
 The Pravdists not only recognise this right, but are more consistent in recognising it than anyone else. 
 The Pravdists, who identified themselves withthe conference of Marxists, which declared that no compul-sory official language was necessary , were the first in Russia to recognise fully the right to use the native language! It is crass ignorance to confuse instruction in the native language with “dividing educational affairs within a single state according to nationality”, with “cultural-nationalautonomy”, with “taking educational affairs out of thehands of the state”. 
 Nowhere in the world are Marxists (or even democrats) opposed to instruction being conducted in the native lan-guage. 
 And nowhere in the world have Marxists adopted the programme of “cultural-national autonomy”; Austria is theonly country in which it was proposed . 
 The example of Finland, as quoted by Madam V. 
 O. 
, is an argument against herself, for in that country the equal-ity of nations and languages (which we recognise unre-servedly and more consistently than anybody) is recognised and carried out, but there is no question there about taking educational affairs out of the hands of the state , about sep-arate national associations to deal with all educationalaffairs, about partitioning up the school system of a countrywith national barriers, and so forth. 
 Put Pravdy No. 
 82, Published according to May 10, 1914 the text in Put Pravdy Signed: V. 
 I. 
 THE POLITICAL SITUATION The present political situation in Russia is marked by the growth of the strike movement in general, as well as byan increase in the number of political strikes (for example,May 1st strikes), and by the growth of the Pravdist trend among the workers (the Insurance Board elections in the two capitals, and the election of the All-Russia InsuranceBoard provided additional proof of this). 
 The connection between the nature of the working-class movement and the trend which the overwhelming majorityof class-conscious workers have recognised as their own is obvious and requires no special explanation. 
 Another feature of the present political situation is the fact that a “Left bloc” is taking exceptionally clear and dis-tinct shape, i. 
e. 
, the emergence of joint action by proletar-ian and bourgeois democrats (Trudoviks and liquidators)against both the Purishkeviches and treacherous bourgeois liberalism. 
 The obstruction organised by the Left in the Duma, and the suspension of the Social-Democrats and Tru-doviks by the votes of the Rights, the Octobrists and a sec-tion of the Progressists, with the Cadets abstaining from voting , have clearly shown what this “Left bloc” is. 
 Pro-letarian democrats have not weakened their independence by a jot, nor have they retreated from their proletarian, Pravdist line. 
 The only ones to support this line againstthe liberals have been the Trudoviks and liquidators, al-though they both often waver and incline towards the lib-erals. 
 Lastly, the present political situation is marked by vacillation and discontent among the bourgeois classes. 
 This was expressed in the speeches and resolutions of the Commer-cial and Industrial Congress. 
 They revealed obvious discon-tent with the government, and an obvious mood of opposi-tion. 
 This also found expression in the anti-Cabinet motion adopted in the Duma by the Octobrists—the Zemstvo peopleand the liberals—during the debate on the estimates of theMinistry of the Interior. 
 Jubilant at the Octobrists havingadopted “their” point of view, the Cadets forget to add thatthey themselves had adopted the Octobrist point of view! The resolution adopted by the Fourth Duma expresses a quite definite counter-revolutionary and imperialist pointof view. 
 In this resolution the government’s policy is con-demned because “administrative tyranny all over the country is causing discontent and unrest among large, tranquil [i. 
e. 
, bourgeois reactionary and landlord] sections of the population, and is thereby stimulating the rise and growth of anti-government tendencies”. 
 The Octobrists are referring to democracy. 
 The Cadets have again and again publicly renounced democracy. 
 Somuch the better, for they never have been, and never canbe, democrats; they merely deceived democracy when they undertook to represent it. 
 Democracy in Russia cannot take a single step forward unless it sees through the bourgeoisliberal frauds perpetrated by the Cadets. 
 To sum up. 
Continued growth of the working-class movement. 
 Great-er unity between the majority of the workers and Pravdism. 
 Definite emergence of a “Left bloc”, expressed in joint action by proletarian and bourgeois democrats (Trudoviksand liquidators) against the Rights and against the Cadets. 
 Disintegration, vacillation, mutual distrust and dis-content within the Third of June system, among the land-lords and reactionary bourgeoisie. 
 “They” accuse one anoth-er—the Purishkeviches accuse the liberals, and the lib-erals the Purishkeviches—of encouraging and acceleratingthe new revolution. 
 Such is the situation. 
 Put Pravdy No. 
 85, Published according to May 13, 1914 the text in Put Pravdy WORKERS ’ UNITY AND INTELLECTUALIST “TRENDS ” In the course of their movement’s progress, the class-conscious workers constantly look back on the road this movement has travelled and constantly consider whether it is the right one, and whether it can possibly be im-proved. 
 Of all the classes in Russia, not a single one, not even the educated and wealthy bourgeoisie, discusses its tactics,that is, the direction and the methods of its movement, so outspokenly, clearly, and as far as possible openly as the working class does. 
 Only people who are shallow-minded orwho fear the participation of the broad masses in politicscan think that the open and heated controversies over tacticsthat are constantly to be seen in the working-class pressare inappropriate or unnecessary. 
 As a matter of fact, it is these heated controversies that help and teach all the work-ers to discuss their own, labour, policy from every angle,and to evolve a firm, distinct and definite class line for themovement. 
 The workers employed at the Stationery Office recently gave a very convincing demonstration of what the attitude of the class-conscious workers is, and should be, towards controversies over tactics, In Put Pravdy No. 
 68, they wrote: “We wish to point out to comrades in the Stationery Office who responded tothe call of the supporters of Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta , and made equal collections for both newspapers in the be-lief that this was a step towards unity, that we consider this step wrong, one that will not lead to the unity of theworking-class movement, but, on the contrary, will put off the day when the workers will unite under the single banner of Marxism. 
 Let us take the following example. 
 Let us assume that two men are arguing heatedly over a question that concerns us, that this argument annoys us, and we wantto put a stop to it. 
 What should we do under the circum-stances? Clearly, we should ascertain which of the two isin the right and take his side; the one who is wrong willthen see that he is mistaken, or, if he does not see his mistake, will peter out and stop arguing. 
 But if we support and encourage both disputants, the argument will nevercease. 
” This is what the workers of the Stationery Office wrote, Their simple explanation, which every worker understands,is unassailable. 
 “Equal” assistance or the desire to merge, or “unite, all trends” (which, incidentally, is what Duma sympathiserswith liquidationism are saying) actually amounts to adesire to order the workers about from outside in the beliefthat the workers themselves are unable to “grasp these things”. 
Any little group of intellectuals can publish a pamphlet or a paltry journal, and proclaim themselves a “trend”, as, for example, the group of the anti-Marxist philosopher Bogda-nov, or Trotsky’s group, or N. 
 N. 
 Himmer’s, which vacil-lates between the Narodniks and the Marxists, and soforth. 
 There are any number of “trends”, and the workers are told: help them all “equally”, recognise “ all trends ”! Naturally, any worker who is at all class-conscious will ask: What is the argument about? About my struggle? About my policy and tactics? About my Party? If so, then I will work it all out for myself, gentlemen, and I will proclaim as my own only those tactics I approve of and agree with. 
 This is as clear as daylight. 
It is only because there is no free press in Russia and because there are still lots of workers (especially in theprovinces) who have seen one or another working-classnewspaper for the first time and are as yet quite “unable to grasp” the problems of working-class policy—it is only because of this that it is possible in Russia for theintellectuals to try to run the workers by appealing to them to recognise “all trends” and to assist them “equally” In the market-place it often happens that the vendor who shouts loudest and calls God to witness is the one withthe shoddiest goods for sale. 
 In the market-place of intellectualist fuss and bustle it often happens that those who shout loudest against run-ning the workers are the very intellectuals who try to do so and proclaim the formation of a countless number of anti-Marxist and anti-proletarian “trends”. 
 Take St. 
 Petersburg. 
 No man in his right mind can deny that, compared with the provinces, the workers in St. 
 Pe-tersburg are more cultured and intelligent, more accustomedto and capable of independently “grasping” all questions connected with the theory of Marxism and the practice of the working-class movement. 
 What do we find there?The St. 
 Petersburg workers did grasp the question, and recognised the Pravdist trend as the right one. 
 The overwhelming majority of the workers in St. 
 Peters-burg declared in favour of Pravdism and proved by action that they recognise only this “trend” as their own . 
 In the provinces the Pravdists preponderate to a lesser extent, but even so they still do preponderate. 
 This hasbeen proved during the last two years by the facts aboutthe workers’ groups, facts which are “unpalatable” to the opponents of Pravdism, but which remain facts for all that. 
 The majority of class-conscious workers discussed the question, weighed the arguments for and against the varioustactics, and recognised the Pravdist tactics as their own . 
 Attempts to thwart and to disrupt the unity and will of this majority of workers are now being made by the found-ers of the intellectualist “trends” of liquidationism, Tro-tskyism ( Borba ), the mixture of Narodism and Marxism (Mr. 
 Himmer’s Sovremennik149), and others. 
 We are convinced that all these intellectualist “trends”, preaching anti-Marxist ideas or urging concessions to them, will fall to the ground upon impact with the class-conscious-ness and the will of the advanced Marxist workers. 
 Theexample of St. 
 Petersburg confirms our conviction. 
 It is highly amusing to hear the intellectualist founders of groups and “trends” that are trying to disrupt the unity of the workers vociferating about “unity”. 
 They are against unity of the workers, which has been achieved in fact, andare for unity of the intellectualist trends, which is promisedin word. 
 Put Pravdy No. 
 85, Published according to May 13, 1914 the text in Put Pravdy THE LEFT NARODNIKS The Left Narodniks in Stoikaya Mysl No. 
 20, and the Narodniks in Russkoye Bogatstvo No. 
 4, have attacked the Narodnik Russkiye Vedomosti for having declared in favour of the freedom of mobilisation, i. 
e. 
, the purchase, sale, and mortgaging of allotment land. 
 This question is interesting because it strikingly confirms the Marxist appraisal of the extremely backward and reac-tionary character of Narodnik theory. 
 The practical sig-nificance of this question is another reason for us to dealwith it. 
 In a society in which commodity production prevails, every small farmer is inevitably and increasingly drawn intothe sphere of exchange and becomes increasingly dependent on the market , not only the local and national, but the world market as well. 
 Each day of economic progress throughout theworld, each mile of new railway laid, each new rural worker who migrates to the town or goes to work in a factory in search of “earnings”, each new agricultural machine that isintroduced, in short, literally each step in world economiclife draws the most remote localities into the sphere ofexchange. 
 Millions and millions of phenomena observedday by day prove that production for exchange, com-modity production, capitalism, are growing in all parts of the world, and all countries without exception. 
 Thatproduction for exchange and simple commodity productionare evolving into capitalism is another phenomenon con-firmed by millions and millions of daily economic observa-tions in every village, in every trade, and in every handi-craft. 
 Clearly, every peasant who finds himself in this milieu of world economy is a commodity producer and with every day becomes more and more dependent on the market, sell-ing his products, buying implements of production and ar-ticles of consumption, hiring labourers, or hiring himself out as a labourer. 
 Under these circumstances, since land isprivate property, freedom to buy, sell and mortgage landis an essential condition for the development of capitalism. 
Attempts to restrict this freedom can lead to nothing excepta thousand and one devices for evading the law, to a thou-sand and one obstacles in the form of red tape and bureauc-racy, to the deterioration of the conditions of the peasants. 
 Attempts to check world capitalism by means of laws orregulations restricting freedom to mobilise the land are justas witless as are attempts to stop a train by means of a wattlefence. 
 To defend such attempts means defending serf bond-age, stagnation and decay in the rural areas. 
 Anyone who has learnt the ABC of political economy knows that Russia is undergoing a change-over from thesystem of serf-ownership to capitalism. 
 There is no “third” system of national economy in Russia. 
 Both the serf-owning system and capitalism signify the exploitation of labour; in this sense both systems signify “the noose and bondage”. 
 But the characteristic features of theserf-owning system are: age-long stagnation, downtroddenand ignorant toilers, and a low level of labour productivity. 
The characteristic features of capitalism are: very rapideconomic and social development, an enormous increase in the productivity of labour, elimination of the slave mentality among the toilers and the awakening of theirability to unite and to take an intelligent part in the affairsof life. 
 Hence, to call capitalism a noose and bondage, and at the same time to advocate , as the Narodniks do, retarding the development of capitalism, means, in fact , defending the survivals of serfdom, barbarism and stagnation. 
 Marxists have always called and will always call the Left Narodniks “socialist-reactionaries”, for advocating restric-tions to the freedom of mobilisation. 
 We advise class-conscious workers to give battle to the Left Narodniks and all other kinds of Narodniks, precisely on this question! It can safely be said that the Left Narod-niks will be backed by dotards, who, in addition to defending restrictions to the freedom of mobilisation, defend belief in the devil, servility, flogging, cohabitation with daughters-in-law, and “instructing ” the womenfolk with a cudgel. 
 We, on the other hand, will have the backing of the entire fresh and literate young generation, who do not believein devils. 
 It is sufficient to quote just one passage fromMr. 
 Peshekhonov to have this generation treat such peoplein the way they deserve. 
 “I said,” writes Mr. 
 Peshekhonov, “that the peasants are not able to make sufficiently sensible use of mortgage loans. 
 And this, of course, is quite understandable, since labour economy does not permit it .... 
” The peasants are not “sensible”, if you please! The feudal-ists and liberal government officials are “able”, if you please, to decide for the peasant! This, then is the interesting, practical, small but plain question that concerns us closely. 
 This is the sort of questionon which the Left-Narodnik gentlemen should be ridiculedat every meeting attended by alert and politically-consciouspeasants. 
 “Labour” economy is the empty, sentimental catchword of the intellectual. 
 Every peasant knows perfectly well thatyou cannot live without buying and selling. 
 This simplefact scatters to the winds all talk about “labour” economy. 
 * * * The Left Narodniks throw dust in the eyes of the “mu-zhik” by confusing the question of freedom of mobilisationwith the advocacy of “taking the land out of commoditycirculation and converting it into public property” ( Stoikaya Mysl No. 
 20). 
 In the first place, only crass ignoramuses can be unaware of the fact that “converting the land into public property”does not mean taking the land out of commodity circulation, but the opposite ; it means drawing it into that circulation more freely and rapidly, and on a larger scale. 
 Learn the political economy of Marx, Messrs. 
 the “so-cialist-reactionaries”! Secondly, as Marx demonstrated and proved, the radical bourgeoisie can put forward, and have often put forward, the demand for the “conversion of the land into public prop-erty”. 
 This cannot be disputed. 
 But only a conservative bourgeois, not a radical, can think that this conversion can be facilitated by the advocacy of feudal restrictions to the freedom of mobilisation. 
 As long as land is private property, any constraints im-posed upon its mobilisation are harmful and reactionary. 
There is no way of achieving the ideals of labour democracy other than by ensuring the most rapid elimination of the traces of serfdom and the most rapid development of capi-talism. 
 * * * Marxists have always said and now repeat that the peas-ants’ democratic views must be divested of feudal survivals. 
 The Narodniks deserve support only insofar as they oppose serfdom and support democracy. 
 But insofar as they defendoppression and backwardness, petty-bourgeois narrow-mindedness and selfishness, they are the greatest of reaction-aries.

 Below we quote, word for word, an editorial article in the liquidationist newspaper Luch , which the liquidators published the day after Malinovsky was elected to the Duma,i. 
e. 
, at a time when the liquidators did not yet have tostoop to foul lies in their struggle against their oppo-nents. 
 The following is the full text of the article ( Luch , October 28, 1912, No. 
 37): R. 
 V. 
 MALINOVSKY (Deputy representing the Moscow workers) The deputy elected by the workers of the Moscow Gubernia is Roman Malinovsky, former secretary of the St. 
 Petersburg Metal-workers’ Union. 
 In his person the Social-Democratic group in the Duma acquires for the first time a prominent practical worker in the trade union movement, who in the grim years of reaction played anactive part in the legal working-class organisations. 
 Malinovsky has been a member of the Union since its foundation on May 1, 1906. 
 At the beginning of 1907 he was elected Secretary ofthe Union and held that responsible post continuously until November1909, when he was arrested at a preliminary meeting of the first work-ers’ delegation to the Temperance Congress. 
 Deportation from St. 
Petersburg interrupted his activities in the Union, but he continuedto maintain ideological contact with the organisation The years of Malinovsky’s secretaryship was a period in the life of the Union in which it had to contend, not only with severe externalconditions, but also with the apathy of the workers themselves. 
 Mali-novsky’s personal example served as an effective weapon against this“internal enemy”. 
 His energy seemed inexhaustible. 
 He undertook the responsible task of leading a strike with the same ardour as he carried out thepainstaking work of organisation. 
 And, what is most important, Malinovsky always strove to link up this day-by-day work with the general tasks of the working-class movement in the struggle around the problems of the day, neverlosing sight of the ultimate aim. 
 Trade union work took up a great deal of Malinovsky’s time and energies, but his activities did not end there. 
 In one degree or anotherhe has participated in all the workers’ actions of the past few years. 
 He represented the St. 
 Petersburg workers at the Co-operative Con-gress in Moscow in 1908. 
 At Easter 1909, he represented the St. 
 Pe-tersburg metalworkers at the First Congress of Factory Panel Doc-tors, where he read a paper on old age and disability insurance. 
 Themetalworkers also elected him their delegate to the TemperanceCongress, but his arrest prevented him from attending. 
 In Moscow Malinovsky’s activities have of necessity been more restricted. 
 But here, too, he has not been idle; he took an active partin the preparations for the Second Congress of Factory Panel Doc-tors, and at one time was closely associated with the workers’ co-operative movement, etc. 
 The new Moscow deputy has always shown a lively interest in the political working-class movement too. 
 In his convictions he is a Bolshevik. 
 But this did not prevent him in 1908, when, after the London Congress, the Bolsheviks tried tosecure Party representation on the executives of the trade unions,from opposing his political friends for the sake of unity of the tradeunion movement. 
 It did not prevent him at the First Congress of Fac-tory Panel Doctors from protesting against the disruptive conduct of the Moscow Bolsheviks in the interests of unity of the workers’delegation. 
 There is every reason to believe that the activities of the new work-ers’ deputy will be as fruitful in the political field as they havebeen in the trade union movement. 
 Such were the complimentary terms in which the liquida-tors themselves wrote about the Bolshevik Malinovsky twoyears ago . 
 Could they have written otherwise, considering the work that Malinovsky was doing in the sight of all theworkers? Even the liquidators, who at that time were already his political opponents, could not but treat him with pro-found respect. 
 They spoke of his preceding activities, whichhad already brought him to the fore, in terms that were mostflattering to Malinovsky. 
 They held him up as an exampleto others There was not a word about his being a “weather-cock”. 
 Nor was the fairy-tale yet invented that he had beenreturned to the Duma as a candidate of liquidationist“unity”. 
 /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR A fortnight later the first meeting of the united Social-Democratic group in the Duma was held. 
 The liquidators themselves unanimously elected Malinovsky as the vice-chairman of the group, in exactly the same way as they hadpreviously supported his candidacy as chairman of workers’delegations to public congresses (the Congress of FactoryPanel Doctors, for example), and so forth. 
 After the Dumaelections, the most prominent member of the August bloc (the pillar of today’s journal Borba ) wrote letters to Mali-novsky couched in the most flattering terms, in which heall but called him a future Bebel. 
 But when it was discovered that Malinovsky sharply opposed liquidationism, when he took a step which he him-self shortly afterwards had to admit was a profoundly erro-neous one, the liquidators poured upon the ex-deputy, upon whom they had previously showered their praise, the fil-thiest slander they could collect in the garbage heaps of theBlack-Hundred newspapers. 
 Everybody knows that with his political background and talents Malinovsky could have played an important role in any political group, and that the liquidators would have honoured him had he associated himself with them. 
 But theliquidators are not ashamed to say that Malinovsky waspushed into the forefront by the “split”. 
 It makes one blush with shame to see people using a man’s private misfortune in their struggle against a hostile polit-ical trend. 
 We have no desire to compare Malinovsky with Khrustalev 151; but what would the liquidators have said, after what happened to Khrustalev, had their politicalopponents made the fate of this one man an excuse for dis-crediting Menshevism, and “used” the Khrustalev caseagainst the entire Menshevik trend? And yet it is common knowledge that Khrustalev was a Menshevik, that he was their prominent representative at the London Congress, inthe press, and so forth. 
 It is common knowledge that at onetime the Mensheviks were proud of Khrustalev. 
 The Pravdists have no lack of political opponents; but not a single hostile newspaper—with the exception, perhaps, of the Dubrovinites and Purishkevich’s paper—has sunk so low as the liquidationist newspaper has sunk these days. 
Even the liberals have behaved far more decently. 
 To hurl the most incredible insults at an opponent and then to end up with a long-winded appeal for ... unity with this very slandered opponent—such are the mean, canting and despicable tactics of all these Martovs and Dans. 
 Their disgusting conduct in connection with Malinovsky’s resignation should open the eyes even of the blind. 
 Rabochy No. 
 2, Published according to May 22, 1914 the text in Rabochy Signed: Pravdist TWO PATHS In an article which attracted the attention of the class-conscious workers, An, leader of the Caucasian liquidators,recently announced that he disagreed with Luch and its successors, disagreed with their opportunist tactics. 
 This statement implies the break-up of the “August bloc”, a fact no subterfuges or tricks can refute. 
 At present, however, we wish to draw the readers’ atten-tion to something else, namely, to An’s argument aboutRussia’s two paths of development. 
 He writes: “Luch bases its tactic on the possibility of reform, it aims at re-form. 
 Pravda bases its tactic on a ‘storm’, it aims at a break-up. 
” From this An draws the conclusion that the two tactics have to be united. 
 This conclusion is wrong. 
 It is not aMarxist conclusion. 
 Let us examine the matter. 
By what is Russia’s path , the nature and speed of her development, determined? By the alignment of social forces, by the resultant of the class struggle. 
 That is obvious. 
What social forces operate in Russia? What is the line of the class struggle? Russia is a capitalist country; she cannot but develop capitalistically. 
 Russia is now undergoing a bourgeois-democratic transformation, a release from the serf-owningsystem, emancipation. 
 Under conditions of world capitalismRussia’s emancipation is inevitable. 
 What we do not yetknow is the resultant of the social forces that are working towards emancipation. 
 These forces, in the main, are: 1) bourgeois monarchist liberalism (the capitalists and someof the landlords of the Progressist, Cadet and partly Octo-brist parties); 2) the bourgeois democrats (the peasantry, urban petty bourgeois, intellectuals, and so on); 3) the pro-letariat. 
 Each of these classes acts—we take only the action of the masses, of course—in line with the economic position ofthe given class. 
 There can be only one resultant. 
 In what sense, then, can we speak of Russia’s two paths? Only in the sense that, until the outcome of the struggle, we do not and shall not know this resultant, which will approach one of the two simplest and clearest lines visible at once to everybody. 
 The first line is “reform”, the seconda “storm”. 
 Reform is the name given to changes which leave the power in the country in the hands of the old ruling class. 
 Changes of the opposite order are called “storms”. 
 The class interests of bourgeois liberalism demand only reforms, since the bourgeoisie is more afraid of “storms” than of reaction,and wishes to keep the old feudalist institutions (the bu-reaucracy, two chambers, and so on) as protection against theworkers. 
 The peasantry in all countries of the world without exception, Russia included, vacillates, in the matter of bourgeois-democratic reform, between the bourgeoisie andthe proletariat. 
 Such vacillation is inevitable, since thepeasants are opposed to the landlords and serfdom whilethemselves being petty proprietors and petty bourgeois. 
 As for the proletariat, its interests, which coincide with those of the vast majority of the population, of all the ex-ploited, move in a direction that is not reformist, along a path which is described in Russia as that of the “three pil-lars”. 
 If the majority of the peasants and the population follow the liberals, the “path” will be the worst, the least advan-tageous to the workers and the exploited, and the most pain-ful to them. 
 If the majority of the peasants and the popula-tion follow the workers, the reverse will be the case. 
 Oneresultant or the other will be fully revealed only by thefinal outcome of the struggle. 
 We now see the true implications of An’s vague and con-fused argument. 
 He has sensed rather than understood the liquidators’ opportunism and their betrayal of the workingclass. 
 The liquidators are reformists. 
 They pursue, in effect, a liberal-labour , not a Marxist workers’ policy. 
 They are trying to subordinate the workers to the bourgeoisie. 
 The Pravdists are pursuing a Marxist and proletarian policy by defending the interests of the working class inthe matter of transforming Russia. 
 Do the Pravdists over-look the possibilities of reform? This question is easily an-swered by referring to the facts. 
 Take insurance reform, which is something real, and not dreamt up. 
 Everyone sees that the Pravdists seized on this ten times more strongly than theliquidators did: see Voprosy Strakhovania152 and the results of the elections to the All-Russia Insurance Board. 
 Take the “partial demands” of the economic struggle during strikes. 
 Everyone knows that the Pravdists are con-ducting this real and not dreamt-up campaign a thousand times more intensely and energetically. 
 If there were a group that denied the use of reforms and partial improvements, we could not join it, because that would be a non-Marxist policy, a policy harmful to theworkers. 
 Neither could we join the liquidators, because repudia-tion and abuse of the “underground”, repudiation and relega-tion of the two “pillars”, the advocacy in present-day Rus-sia of a struggle for a legal party and the possibility of po-litical reforms—all this is a betrayal of the working class,desertion to the bourgeoisie. 
 The Pravdists, in the words of An, “aim at a storm and break-up” but, as the facts show, miss no opportunity, how-ever slight, of supporting real reforms and partial improve-ments and explaining to the masses the sham of reformism. 
This is the only correct, the only truly Marxist tactic, andthat is why it has been adopted by the overwhelming majority of the class-conscious workers throughout Russia (this has been proved by the facts, by the number of workers’ groups). 
 Only adherents of petty-bourgeois democracy, the Na-rodniks and the liquidators, are vainly fighting against theworkers, against Pravdism. 
 Rabochy No. 
 3, Published according to May 24, 1914 the text in Rabochy PLEKHANOV , WHO KNOWS NOT WHAT HE WANTS Plekhanov, as we know, has often found himself in an awkward fix on questions of tactics and organisation. 
 Dur-ing the past eleven years (since the autumn of 1903, whenhe went over from the Bolsheviks to the Mensheviks) he has repeatedly and comically made a muddle of these questions. 
 He is beginning to get muddled again, a sad circumstance we feel obliged to acquaint our readers with. 
 But first ofall, we will recall the great service that Plekhanov renderedduring the difficult years (1909-11). 
 He praised the “under-ground” and staunchly supported the Party decisions on combating liquidationism. 
 He exposed the opportunism of the liquidators and their revival of Economism (a bour-geois trend in Marxism in 1894-1902). 
 He showed that, byrepudiating the “underground”, the liquidators were betray-ing the Party. 
 He quite rightly explained that “Mr. 
 Pot-resov” was a Judas, and that the apostles were stronger without Judas than with him. 
 These were clear, definite and integral ideas, fully in keeping with the decisions of 1908 and 1910. 
 But look at Plekhanov’s new volte-face . 
 In the newspaper Yedinstvo 153 he now denounces the Pravdists for their “fac-tionalism” and “usurpation”, and asserts that we have “not one working-class press but two”. 
 This is not very literate, but the meaning is clear. 
 A liquidationist newspaper is declared a working-class news-paper! Fancy that! And yet this, selfsame Plekhanov hadargued that the resolution declaring liquidationism to bea manifestation of bourgeois influence on the proletariat was a correct one. 
 It is useless for Plekhanov to try to forget this. 
 The work-ers will only ridicule such forgetfulness. 
 The liquidationist press is not a workers’ press, but one that serves as a vehicle of bourgeois influence on the prole-tariat . 
 This has been definitely and clearly stated in the decision of the “entire Marxist body”,154 and the liquidators are to this day strikingly corroborating it (see, for example,the concordant remarks of Bulkin and Martov against the “underground” in Nasha Zarya , 1914, No. 
 3). 
 What is the meaning of Plekhanov’s appeals for unity with the liquidators? Unity with the group of publicists who repudiate the “underground” in true Potresov style?To advocate such unity one must advocate repudiation of the “underground ”! Plekhanov has got into such a muddle that he does not know where he stands. 
 The liquidators have made it abundantly clear in Nasha Zarya , in Novaya Rabochaya Gazeta (run by F. 
 D. 
 and L. 
 M. 
) and through the agency of Chkheidze and Co. 
, thatthey stand their ground , i. 
e. 
, they defend Potresov and tolerate abuse of the “underground”. 
 They defend the ideaof a legal workers’ party. 
 But Plekhanov condemns liquidationism as a crime against the Party while at the same time advocating “unity” withthe liquidators. 
 We can only smile at this. 
The Pravdists warmly welcome all workers who really want to recognise the “form” which Potresov rejects; as for the empty phrases about “unity” with the opponents of the “underground”, they regard them as empty phrases frompeople who know not what they want. 
 The Pravdists calmly meet the charge of being “usurpers” by saying: Does not one who is fond of declaiming, who isfond of phrases and dreads the facts , resemble a usurper and impostor? Plekhanov lives abroad; why is he so modestly reticent about the fact that from August 1912 to May 1914the liquidators have not published a single issue of their newspaper abroad? Neither have they published a single factual reference to “organisations” which Plekhanov toohas defended. 
 The opponents of the liquidators, however, have pub-lished a number of factual references to all localities in Russia, in a number of issues. 
 Plekhanov says nothing about these facts, because the facts refute his phrases. 
 Take the openly verifiable data published in Russia. 
 During two full years, 1912 and 1913, the Pravdists united (and proved this by group collections) 2,801 workers’ groups; the liquidators united 750. 
 If we add 1914, from February 1 to May 6 (preliminary estimate), we shall have 5,302 as against 1,382. 
 The Pravdists have a majority of about four-fifths ! Naturally, the only thing that people who dread the facts can do is to keep on uttering phrases. 
 Around the precise and clear decisions, thrice supple-mented and verified by the representatives of the workers(in January 1912 and in February and the summer of 1913), the Pravdists united four-fifths of the class-conscious work-ers in Russia. 
 These decisions have been amplified inhundreds of articles and have been put into effect. 
 Now these are not phrases, not fables, not anecdotes about goitres and savages (Plekhanov is still retailing old jokes!)but facts . 
 This is real unity , unity of the workers , who have tested their tactics by experience. 
 To slightingly call these tactics “Leninist”—tactics which have been approved by thousands of workers—is only acompliment to Lenin, but it does not do away with the 5,000 workers’ groups, with their unity, or with their Party. 
 The catchwords “factionalism”, “fragmentation”, “dis-integration”, and so forth, apply to Plekhanov and his pres-ent-day friends. 
 Look at the list of contributors to the intel-lectualist Narodnik journal Sovremennik , published on page 1 of Plekhanov’s Yedinstvo . 
 Here we have Himmer and Co. 
 who preach anti-Marxist ideas. 
 Plekhanov was right when he described them as the ideas of “ socialist-reaction-aries ”. 
 Here we have the god-builders and Machists: Bogda-nov, Bazarov and Lunacharsky. 
 Here we have the liquida-tors: Dan, Martov and Cherevanin (for some reason Potre-sov, mentioned in No. 
 66 of Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta , is missing from the list). 
 Here also we have the liberal Bogucharsky, and so forth. 
 And in this Sovremennik , which lacks the faintest trace of anything working-class, Mr. 
 Himmer openly boasts that Plekhanov is in favour of unity with him! But Plekhanov is silent. 
 Is it not time to doff the mask, before the workers tear it off, perhaps rudely! Among intellectualist anti-Marxist circles, among the flotsam of bourgeois democracy—thisis where poor Plekhanov has accidentally landed. 
 Thisis where you will find chaos, disintegration and tiny factions,which are opposing the unity achieved in the course of two years by thousands of workers’ groups of the Pravdist trend. 
 We are sorry for Plekhanov. 
 Considering the struggle he waged against the opportunists, Narodniks, Machists andliquidators, he deserves a better fate. 
 We shall, however,continue to build up the unity of the workers’ groups—al-ready built to the extent of four-fifths—which pursue defi-nite tactics tested by experience. 
 We shall accept anybody and everybody who renounces liquidationism; the door is not locked. 
 With the example of Trotsky’s Borba and Plekhanov’s Yedinstvo before our eyes, we shall show the deplorable and ridiculous vacillations of the intellectualist grouplets which, cut off from the working-class movement, keep on vacil-lating, swing to one side one day and to the other side thenext, from the weak-kneed intellectual Potresov to the weak-kneed intellectual Himmer. 
 This is a sad spectacle, but one that is inevitable in apetty-bourgeois country in the epoch of bourgeois-democrat-ic transformations. 
 Rabochy No. 
 4, Published according to May 25, 1914 the text in Rabochy THE ESTIMATES OF THE MINISTR Y OF AGRICULTUR E155 Our government considers its new agrarian policy—that of stepping up the destruction of the village communes by means of the rural superintendents156 and of encouraging the otrub system—a highly effective weapon in its struggle against the revolution. 
 Already in 1906, soon after the revo-lution, the Council of the United Nobility 157 called upon the government to introduce private landownership amongthe peasantry so as to create, as quickly as possible, a classof rich peasants that would side with the landlords against the peasant masses. 
 Stolypin immediately adopted the policy recommended by the Council of the United Nobility. 
The landlord parties in the Third Duma, the Rights andthe Octobrists, whole-heartedly supported this new agrar-ian policy, which they regarded, not only as an effectivemeans of combating the revolution, but as a great advance towards the European economic system, a step towards eliminating the survivals of serfdom. 
 As is known, the praises of the new agrarian policy, which is represented as an instrument of “emancipation”,have been sung in a thousand different keys in the govern-mental, Right, and Octobrist press. 
 It is from this standpoint that I wish, in my speech, to deal with the principles underlying the government’s policy on the agrarian question. 
 We are told on every hand thatthe number of land plots “registered” as private propertyand the number of otrubs are increasing. 
 But nothing is said about the extent to which bondage and feudal relations still exist in our rural districts. 
 Yet that is the crux of the matter. 
 We are promised a “European” reform of our back-ward agriculture, with the class of the feudalist Purishke-viches retaining full economic and political power. 
 The promises remain promises, but what is the state of affairs in the countryside today , after all the progress the govern-ment boasts of? To what extent are the peasant masses still borne down by bondage and feudalist oppression? To answer this question I shall call to witness a journal whose editor recently won well-merited and enthusiasticpraise from Anthony , Bishop of Volhynia himself , and, of course, from writers like Rozanov of Novoye Vremya , who are notoriously reactionary and notoriously ready to servethe government. 
 This is not a “Left” journal, God forbid! Itis a journal run by people who have echoed all the abuse and vituperation the reactionaries heap on the revolution. 
It is a journal which stands up stoutly for clericalism and the sanctity of landlord property. 
 You probably guess that I am referring to Russkaya Mysl . 
 This journal, by way of exception, spoke the truth and quoted figures, precise figures, showing the extent to whichthings like métayage and winter hiring are practised in Rus-sia. 
 Everybody knows that these are common everyday features in our countryside. 
 But “everybody” prefers to speak about everything under the sun except these everydayfeatures. 
 “Winter hiring,” writes this journal, “is this not absurd in our age, the age of electricity and aeroplanes ? And yet this form of slavery andbondage continues to flourish to this day, like a leech on the body ofthe nation .... 
 W inter hiring has preserved in all its freshness the feu-dal term of ‘bonded’ peasants. 
” This appraisal of winter hiring is not mine, but that of a journal notorious for its hatred of revolution. 
 Slavery, bond-age, serfdom—this is what quite “loyal” people are com-pelled to call “the order of things” existing in our country-side. 
 In winter hiring: “the peasant accepts the hardest conditions, as little as a half and a third of the pay he usually receives in spring and summer hiring. 
 Inwinter he gets paid as much per dessiatine for ploughing (three times)sowing, reaping or mowing, binding, and carting to the threshing shed as he does in summer only for harvesting (reaping and binding). 
 ” How many peasants abide in this state of serfdom, bond-age and slavery? “According to local reports, in the spring of 1913 the number of ‘bonded’ households in some villages of the South-West was as muchas 48 per cent of the total, in Mogilev Gubernia 52 per cent, and inChernigov Gubernia 56 per cent. 
” And this, mind you, refers to the spring of 1913! This is after the harvest of 1912! This was during the allegedsensational successes of the so-called “land organisation”,which the government is boasting of and proclaiming from the house-tops! What else, after that, can you call this notorious “land organisation” but a whited sepulchre, which masks the sameold serfdom? Half the peasant households are “bonded”, enslaved through dire poverty. 
 Hunger, hunger even during a good crop year, makes the peasants give their labour in thrall to the landlord in winter for a third of the pay. 
 In practice, thisamounts to a continuation of the corvée, of serfdom, becausethe very essence of serfdom is preserved in the shape of apauperised, starving, ruined peasant, who, even in the bestyear, is compelled to till the landlord’s land with his poor implements and half-starved animals on terms of “winter hiring”. 
 Let the number of plots registered as private property increase. 
 This may even be a useful measure in regard tothose proletarians who will rid themselves of a burden andbe freer to fight for liberty and socialism. 
 But, obviously, no “registrations”, no “blessings” of private ownership can help those millions of households, those tensof millions of peasants, who have nowhere to go to from the village and are compelled to give themselves in winter inthrall to the landlords. 
 These peasants are bound to strive towards a transfer of all the landed estates into their hands without payment, for this is the only way out for them, the only escape from hopeless enslavement. 
 Communal landownership has noth-ing to do with it. 
 Both the homesteader and the fullest“individual proprietor” will, like the commune peasant,remain for ever downtrodden slaves if they are unable to make their crop last longer than St. 
 Nicholas Day * and *December 6 (old style). 
— Ed. 
 are compelled to borrow from the landlord on usurious terms. 
 It is absurd, as far as these tens of millions of peasants are concerned, to speak about the “progress” of farming,about a “rising level of agriculture”, about improved meth-ods of working the land, and so forth. 
 What improvedmethods can there be when dire poverty makes the peasanthire himself out to the landlord at a third of the pay, while in the summer his own grain is spilling because in the sum-mer the police will drag him away to work for the “ squire ” in payment for the advances of grain or money he has hadfrom him! And the landlord, who advances grain or money for winter hiring, is quite unlike the “European” employer, or any capitalist employer for that matter. 
 He is not an employer, but a usurer or a feudal lord. 
 Improved methods are not onlyunnecessary under such a “system of farming”, but positivelyundesirable . 
 They are both unnecessary and detrimental to it. 
 A ruined, pauperised, starving peasant with half-starvedanimals and wretched implements—that is what this landlord system of farming needs , a system that is perpetu-ating the backwardness of Russia and the misery of the peas-ants. 
 With the bulk of the peasant population living undersuch conditions of serf dependence, these conditions wouldcontinue for decades to come, until the peasants liberatedthemselves from this yoke; for the creation of a small minority of rich “ otrub farmers”, or the establishment of private holdings and their sale by the proletarians, wouldhave no effect whatever on the enslaved position of thepeasant masses. 
 This is what the praisers of the new, Stolypin agrarian policy forget, or rather try to forget, try to obscure and screen. 
 They all sing in chorus that this policy means “prog-ress”, but what they do not say is that this progress affects a very small minority and is proceeding at a snail’s pace,while the majority are in the same old state of bondage and serfdom. 
 The number of otrub farmers is increasing, more machines are being imported into Russia, grass cultivation is devel-oping, and the number of co-operative societies in the ruraldistricts is growing. 
 All that is true, defenders of the govern-ment! But there is the reverse of the medal, which you are trying to conceal. 
 For all this much-vaunted progress, most of the peasants are still in a state of feudal slavery. 
 That is what makes all this “progress” so meager and precarious ; that is what makes famines inevitable; that is what makesthe home market so weak and wretched, that is what enablesoppression and tyranny to maintain such a firm hold, andthat is what increases the inevitability of another agrarian revolution, because all the greater is the contradiction be-tween an age of aeroplanes, electricity and automobiles, and“winter hiring” or “métayage”. 
 And here are the latest figures on métayage in Russia, given in the journal, approved of by Anthony of Volhynia. 
The peasants’ crops cultivated on the métayer system amount-ed to 21 per cent of the crops on their own lands in the Central gubernias, to 42 per cent in the Lake gubernias, andto 68 per cent in the North-Western gubernias! The corres-ponding figures for grass mowing are 50 per cent in the Cen-tral gubernias, and 110-185 per cent in the Lake, Trans-Volgaand North-Western gubernias! Thus, métayer haymaking predominates over the peasants’ own haymaking in three vast regions of Russia! What is the “métayer system”? “The peasant, using the landlord’s land but his own seeds, does all the cultivation and harvesting down to carting the sheaves to thethreshing shed, and takes only half the crop for himself. 
 The haymeadows are worked on a “one-third” system, the métayer taking onehaycock to every two that go to the landlord. 
” But that is not all. 
 “In some cases (especially in Minsk and Chernigov gubernias), the métayer in addition to paying for the land with half the crop,and for the Lay with two-thirds of the crop, is obliged to work gratis on the owner ’s farm for one or two weeks , in most cases with his own horse , or with one of his children . 
” What is this if not the corvée, pure and simple? What is this if not the ancient serf system of farming? There is nothing new in these figures whatever. 
 On the contrary—they reveal to us the hoary past, which has sur-vived in all its monstrous aspects side by side with the “new” agrarian policy. 
 Anyone in touch with rural life has longbeen aware of the existence of this hoary past. 
 Statisticians and observers of country life have written dozens and hun-dreds of books about that past. 
 And that hoary past predomi-. 
 nates to this day, perpetuating the scandalous backwardness and scandalous tyranny that reign in Russia. 
 No laws can put a stop to this serfdom so long as the bulk of the land remains the property of the all-powerful land-lords. 
 No “private landownership” in place of the “communes”of downtrodden peasants can be of any help. 
 According to the official statistics on landownership for 1905 published by the Ministry of the Interior less than 30,000 landlords in European Russia own seventy million dessiatines of land. 
 Written before May 28 (June 10), 1914 First published in 1924 Published according to in the journal Proletarskaya the manuscript Revolutsia No. 
 3 (26) UNITY “The workers are tired of splits. 
 The workers want unity. 
 The workers are disgusted at the fact that the split sometimeseven takes the form of brawling .... 
” Such and similar statements can sometimes be heard from workers. 
 The workers do need unity. 
 And the important thing to remember is that nobody but themselves will “give” them unity, that nobody can help them achieve unity. 
 Unity cannot be “promised”—that would be vain boasting, self-deception; unity cannot be “created” out of “agreements” between intellectualist groups. 
 To think so is a profoundly sad, naïve, and ignorant delusion. 
 Unity must be won , and only the workers, the class-con-scious workers themselves can win it—by stubborn and per-sistent effort. 
 Nothing is easier than to write the word “unity” in yard-long letters, to promise it and to “proclaim” oneself an ad-vocate of unity. 
 In reality, however, unity can be furtheredonly by the efforts and organisation of the advanced workers,of all the class-conscious workers. 
 Unity without organisation is impossible. 
 Organisation is impossible unless the minority bows to the majority. 
 These are incontestible truths. 
 Nobody will question them. 
 The only—only!—thing is to put them into effect. 
 Thatis not easy. 
 That requires effort, perseverance, the solidarityof all class-conscious workers. 
 But without that effort thereis no use talking about working-class unity. 
 The resolution adopted by the Amsterdam International Congress presses for the unity of the workers’ parties in all countries. 
 158 This resolution is correct. 
 It demands the unity of the workers , but with us attempts are being made to substitute for it the unity of intellectualist groups which refuse to bow to the will of the workers ! It would be ridiculous, were it not so sad. 
 During the last two-and-a-half years (since January 1, 1912), the majority of the class-conscious workers all overRussia have, in fact, united around the Pravdist decisionsadopted in January 1912, in February 1913 and in the sum-mer of 1913. 
 This is proved by precise figures showing the number of workers’ groups in which collections have been made for various newspapers. 
 The various intellectualistgroups which cannot find any backing among the mass ofthe workers may ignore these figures and pass them overin silence, but they cannot do away with them. 
 It only showsthat the various intellectualist groups are cut off from the masses of the workers and are afraid of the truth . 
 The number of workers’ groups in which collections were made for newspapers in St. 
 Petersburg: Pravdist Liquida-tionist For the two full years, 1912 and 1913 ...... 2,801750 For half of 1914 (January 1 to May 13) ...... 2,873 671 Total ...... 5,674 1,421 These figures, which have been published many times and have never been revised or challenged, show that the liqui-dators have the support of only one-fifth of the class-conscious workers (and their figures include all their allies; the Caucasians, Trotskyists, Bundists and the Letts; theirallies are now falling away from them; the Letts have al-ready done so ). 
 Thus, four-fifths of the workers have accepted the Prav-dist decisions as their own , have approved of Pravdism, and actually rallied around Pravdism. 
 Now this is real unity of the workers , not of intellectualist groups, unity in deed, not merely in word, unity as a resultof two-and-a-half years of effort in the working-class move-ment all over Russia, not a mere promise of unity. 
 It is for this unity, for submission to this four-fifths majori-ty of the workers, that we must go on fighting. 
 There is not, nor can there be , any other way to unity. 
 The workers are not infants to believe that this four-fifths majority will allow the minority of one-fifth, or intellectuals who have no workers’ backing at all, to flout the will of the majority of the workers! The very idea is ridiculous and absurd. 
 Let those who want to abuse the Pravdists and call them “usurpers” do so. 
 Let this abuse unite the liquidators, Ple-khanov, Trotsky, the Vperyodists, the Bundists, and anybodyelse who pleases. 
 This is abuse coming from impotent littlegroups, who are angry at their own impotence. 
 This clamour for “unity” on the part of impotent little groups, which have cut themselves off from the masses of the workers, is sheerhypocrisy, for it is they who are violating unity, it is they who are flouting the will of the majority by their splitting tactics . 
 These groups are striving in vain. 
 Their abuse is not worth taking notice of. 
 The Pravdist workers are building up and will continue to build up the unity of the workers , despite all vituperation from angry but impotent intellec-tualist groups. 
 Trudovaya Pravda No. 
 2, Published according to May 30, 1914 the text in Trudovaya Pravda A FOOL ’S HASTE IS NO SPEED A recent issue of Der Kampf ,159 the Austrian Social-Democratic monthly, contained a sensational paragraphsigned F. 
 A. 
, stating that Eduard Bernstein, leader of theGerman opportunists, had renounced his revisionist, oppor-tunist views and returned to Marxism. 
 Revisionism—revision of Marxism—is today one of the chief manifestations, if not the chief, of bourgeois influ-ence on the proletariat and bourgeois corruption of the work-ers. 
 That is why Eduard Bernstein, the opportunist lead-er, has won such world-wide notoriety. 
 And now we are told that Bernstein has returned to Marx-ism. 
 This piece of news should seem strange to anyone at all familiar with German Social-Democratic literature. 
 Sozialistische Monatshefte ,* the principal organ of the opportunists, is still published and continues to preachpurely bourgeois views which, in effect, amount to a completebetrayal of socialism. 
 And Bernstein continues to be a lead-ing contributor to the journal. 
 What can the matter be? It appears that Bernstein gave a lecture in Budapest in which, according to a local paper, he renounced revisionism. 
 F. 
 A. 
, the Austrian author, has proved exceedingly gul-lible and imprudent in hastening to proclaim to the worldthat Bernstein has revised his views. 
 But the liquidator V. 
 Levitsky, one of the leading opportunist contributors to the opportunist journal Nasha Zarya (the Menshevik Plekhanov has dubbed it the Russian “ Socialist Monthly ”) has proved more imprudent still: in Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta (April 3, No. 
 46) he published a lengthy article under the resonant title of “From Revisionism to Marxism”, based wholly on F. 
 A. 
’s report. 
 *Socialist Monthly . 
—Ed. 
 Mr. 
 Levitsky did not even wait for Bernstein’s lecture to appear in the press. 
 A fool’s haste is no speed. 
 On learning what world-wide “fame” his Budapest lecture had won, Bernstein wrote a letter to the Brussels Social-Democratic paper Le Peuple 160 on April 11 (new style) in which he bluntly declared: “The report in Der Kampf is absolutely without foundation. 
 I said nothing new in Buda-pest and did not recant any of the views expressed in Prem-ises of Socialism [Bernstein’s chief opportunist work]. 
 The report of my lecture in the Budapest paper simplyconfused my words with the remarks of the reporter!” The whole affair proved an ordinary newspaper hoax. 
It did, however, reveal the deplorable proneness of some Austrian (only Austrian?) Social-Democrats to disguise opportunism and proclaim its disappearance. 
 Excessive zeal has carried Mr. 
 Levitsky to preposterous lengths. 
 He writes in Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta : “With the reversion [?] to Marxism of the father [?] of revision-ism, Bernstein, revisionism within the German Social-Democratic movement has been killed for good [!?]. 
” Every word here is a gem: there has been no reversion, Bernstein is no father, revisionism has not been killed. 
 “In Russia” the zealous Mr. 
 Levitsky writes, “revisionism has ceased to be a modish doctrine even among the Left Narodniks, who at one time were inclined to fall back on it in their fight against Marxism. 
 Within the Russian Social-Democratic movement revisionism hadno influence whatever, despite the attempts of some writers to trans-plant it to Russian soil. 
” Every word here is an untruth. 
 On all major issues the Left Narodniks even now “fall back on” the revisionist“doctrines”. 
 That is proved by every issue of Russkoye Bo-gatstvo and Zavety , by every issue of Stoikaya Mysl . 
 Gloss-ing over the opportunism of the Left Narodniks can only cause harm. 
 There has been some revisionist influence within Russian Social-Democracy since the very beginning of the mass work-ing-class and mass Social-Democratic movement in 1895-96. 
Does Mr. 
 Levitsky mean to say he has not heard of the strug-gle which consistent Marxists and adherents of the old Iskra waged for many years against the Economists? Does hemean to say he has not heard of the Party resolutions and the numerous articles written during that period, affirming, proving and explaining that Economism was the Russian form of revisionism and opportunism? Does Mr. 
 Levitsky mean to say he has forgotten about Mr. 
 A. 
 Martynov, aleading liquidator of today, and a leading Economist ofyesterday? Mr. 
 Levitsky denies revisionism in order to disguise his own revisionism. 
 We would remind him only of the four following facts: 1) Was it not the Menshevik Plekhanov who declared in the press in 1909-10 that the Mensheviks hadabsorbed into their ranks quite a number of opportunistelements? 2) Was it not the same Plekhanov who demonstratedthe opportunist nature of the liquidationist “fight-for-legal-ity” slogan? 3) Was it not several anti-liquidationist Menshe-viks who demonstrated the connection between liquidationism and Economism? 4) Is it not opportunism to renounce, asKoltsov does, “two pillars” (out of the three) as unsuitablefor agitation? These four facts alone—and forty-four more could be cited—are clear proof that the Economism of 1895-1902, the Menshevism of 1903-08 and the liquidationism of 1908-14, all represent the Russian form or species of opportunism andrevisionism, no more and no less.

 Ilyin DISRUPTION OF UNITY UNDER COVER OF OUTCRIES FOR UNITY Published in May 1914 Published according to in the journal Prosveshcheniye No. 
 5 the text in the journal Signed: V. 
 Ilyin The questions of the present-day working-class movement are in many respects vexed questions, particularly for repre-sentatives of that movement ’s recent past (i. 
e. 
, of the stage which historically has just drawn to a close). 
 This appliesprimarily to the questions of so-called factionalism, splits,and so forth. 
 One often hears intellectuals in the working-class movement making nervous, feverish and almost hys-terical appeals not to raise these vexed questions. 
 Those who have experienced the long years of struggle betweenthe various trends among Marxists since 1900-01, for exam-ple, may naturally think it superfluous to repeat many of thearguments on the subject of these vexed questions. 
 But there are not many people left today who took part in the fourteen-year-old conflict among Marxists (not to speak of the eighteen-or nineteen-year-old conflict, counting fromthe moment the first symptoms of Economism appeared). 
The vast majority of the workers who now make up the ranksof the Marxists either do not remember the old conflict, orhave never heard of it. 
 To the overwhelming majority (as, incidentally, was shown by the opinion poll held by our journal 161), these vexed questions are a matter of exception-ally great interest. 
 We therefore intend to deal with thesequestions, which have been raised as it were anew (and for the younger generation of the workers they are really new)by Trotsky’s “non-factional workers’ journal”, Borba . 
 I. 
 “FACTIONALISM” Trotsky calls his new journal “non-factional”. 
 He puts this word in the top line in his advertisements; this wordis stressed by him in every key, in the editorial articles of Borba itself, as well as in the liquidationist Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta , which carried an article on Borba by Trotsky before the latter began publication. 
 What is this “non-factionalism”? Trotsky’s “workers’ journal” is Trotsky’s journal for workers, as there is not a trace in it of either workers’ ini-tiative, or any connection with working-class organisations. 
Desiring to write in a popular style, Trotsky, in his journalfor workers, explains for the benefit of his readers the mean-ing of such foreign words as “territory”, “factor”, and so forth. 
 Very good. 
 But why not also explain to the workers the meaning of the word “non-factionalism”? Is that word more intelligible than the words “territory” and “factor”? No, that is not the reason. 
 The reason is that the label “non-factionalism” is used by the worst representativesof the worst remnants of factionalism to mislead the young-er generation of workers. 
 It is worth while devoting a little time to explaining this. 
 Group-division was the main distinguishing feature of the Social-Democratic Party during a definite historicalperiod. 
 Which period? From 1903 to 1911. 
 To explain the nature of this group-division more clearly we must recall the concrete conditions that existed in, say, 1906-07. 
 At that time the Party was united, there was no split, but group-division existed, i. 
e. 
, in the united Partythere were virtually two groups, two virtually separate organisations. 
 The local workers’ organisations were unit-ed, but on every important issue the two groups devisedtwo sets of tactics. 
 The advocates of the respective tactics disputed among themselves in the united workers’ organi-sations (as was the case, for example, during the discussionof the slogan: a Duma, or Cadet, Ministry, in 1906, or dur-ing the elections of delegates to the London Congress in1907), and questions were decided by a majority vote . 
 One group was defeated at the Stockholm Unity Congress (1906), the other was defeated at the London Unity Congress (1907). 
 These are commonly known facts in the history of organ-ised Marxism in Russia. 
 It is sufficient to recall these commonly known facts to realise what glaring falsehoods Trotsky is spreading. 
 For over two years, since 1912, there has been no fac-tionalism among the organised Marxists in Russia, no dis-putes over tactics in united organisations, at united confer-ences and congresses. 
 There is a complete break between the Party, which in January 1912 formally announced that the liquidators do not belong to it, and the liquidators. 
 Trotsky often calls this state of affairs a “split”, and we shall deal with this appellation separately later on. 
 But it remainsan undoubted fact that the term “factionalism” deviates from the truth . 
 As we have said, this term is a repetition, an uncritical, unreasonable, senseless repetition of what was true yester-day, i. 
e. 
, in the period that has already passed. 
 When Trotsky talks to us about the “chaos of factional strife”(see No. 
 1, pp. 
 5, 6, and many others) we realise at once which period of the past his words echo. 
 Consider the present state of affairs from the viewpoint of the young Russian workers who now constitute nine-tenths of the organised Marxists in Russia. 
 They see three mass expressions of the different views, or trends in the working-class movement: the Pravdists, gathered around a newspaperwith a circulation of 40,000; the liquidators (15,000 circula-tion) and the Left Narodniks (10,000 circulation). 
 The cir-culation figures tell the reader about the mass character of a given tenet. 
 The question arises: what has “chaos” got to do with it? Everybody knows that Trotsky is fond of high-soundingand empty phrases. 
 But the catchword “chaos” is not only phrase-mongering; it signifies also the transplanting, or rather, a vain attempt to transplant, to Russian soil, in the present period, the relations that existed abroad in a bygone period. 
 That is the whole point. 
 There is no “chaos” whatever in the struggle between the Marxists and the Narodniks. 
 That, we hope, not even Trotsky will dare to deny. 
 The struggle between the Marxists andthe Narodniks has been going on for over thirty years, ever since Marxism came into being. 
 The cause of this struggle is the radical divergence of interests and viewpoints of twodifferent classes, the proletariat and the peasantry. 
 If thereis any “chaos” anywhere, it is only in the heads of crankswho fail to understand this. 
 What, then, remains? “Chaos” in the struggle between the Marxists and the liquidators? That, too, is wrong, for a struggle against a trend , which the entire Party recognised as a trend and condemned as far back as 1908, cannot be called chaos. 
 And everybody who has the least concern for the history of Marxism in Russia knows that liquidation-ism is most closely and inseverably connected, even as regards its leaders and supporters, with Menshevism (1903-08) and Economism (1894-1903). 
 Consequently, here, too,we have a history extending over nearly twenty years. 
 Toregard the history of one’s own Party as “chaos” reveals anunpardonable empty-headedness. 
 Now let us examine the present situation from the point of view of Paris or Vienna. 
 At once the whole picture changes. 
 Besides the Pravdists and liquidators, we see no less than five Russian groups claiming membership of one and the same Social-Democratic Party: Trotsky’s group, two Vpe-ryod groups, the “pro-Party Bolsheviks” and the “pro-Party Mensheviks”. 
 162 All Marxists in Paris and in Vienna (for the purpose of illustration I take two of the largest centres)are perfectly well aware of this. 
 Here Trotsky is right in a certain sense; this is indeed group-division, chaos indeed! Groups within the Party, i. 
e. 
, nominal unity (all claim to belong to one Party) and actual disunity (for, in fact, all the groups are independent of one another and enterinto negotiations and agreements with each other as sovereignpowers). 
 “Chaos”, i. 
e. 
, the absence of (1) objective and verifiable proof that these groups are linked with the working-class movement in Russia and (2) absence of any data to enable us to judge the actual ideological and political physiognomyof these groups. 
 Take a period of two full years—1912 and1913. 
 As everybody knows, this was a period of the revivaland upswing of the working-class movement, when everytrend or tendency of a more or less mass character (and in politics this mass character alone counts) could not but exer-cise some influence on the Fourth Duma elections, thestrike movement, the legal newspapers, the trade unions,the insurance election campaign, and so on. 
 Throughoutthose two years, not one of these five groups abroad asserteditself in the slightest degree in any of the activities of the mass working-class movement in Russia just enumer-ated! That is a fact that anybody can easily verify. 
 And that fact proves that we were right in calling Trotsky a representative of the “worst remnants of factionalism”. 
 Although he claims to be non-factional, Trotsky is known to everybody who is in the least familiar with the working-class movement in Russia as the representative of “Tro-tsky’s faction ”. 
 Here we have group-division, for we see two essential symptoms of it: (1) nominal recognition of unityand (2) group segregation in fact. 
 Here there are remnants of group-division, for there is no evidence whatever of any real connection with the mass working-class movement in Russia. 
 And lastly, it is the worst form of group-division, for there is no ideological and political definiteness. 
 It cannot be denied that this definiteness is characteristic of boththe Pravdists (even our determined opponent L. 
 Martov admits that we stand “solid and disciplined” around univer-sally known formal decisions on all questions) and theliquidators (they, or at all events the most prominent ofthem, have very definite features, namely, liberal, notMarxist). 
 It cannot be denied that some of the groups which, like Trotsky’s, really exist exclusively from the Vienna-Paris, but by no means from the Russian, point of view, possess adegree of definiteness. 
 For example, the Machist theories of the Machist Vperyod group are definite; the emphatic repudiation of these theories and defence of Marxism, inaddition to the theoretical condemnation of liquidationism, by the “pro-Party Mensheviks”, are definite. 
 Trotsky, however, possesses no ideological and political definiteness, for his patent for “non-factionalism”, as weshall soon see in greater detail, is merely a patent to flit freely to and fro, from one group to another. 
 To sum up: 1) Trotsky does not explain, nor does he understand, the historical significance of the ideological disagreements among the various Marxist trends and groups, although these dis-agreements run through the twenty years’ history of Social-Democracy and concern the fundamental questions of thepresent day (as we shall show later on); 2) Trotsky fails to understand that the main specific fea-tures of group-division are nominal recognition of unity and actual disunity; 3) Under cover of “non-factionalism” Trotsky is champion-ing the interests of a group abroad which particularly lacks definite principles and has no basis in the working-class movement in Russia. 
 All that glitters is not gold. 
 There is much glitter and sound in Trotsky’s phrases, but they are meaningless. 
 II. 
 THE SPLIT “Although there is no group-division, i. 
e. 
, nominal recognition of unity, but actual disunity, among you, Prav-dists, there is something worse, namely, splitting tactics,”we are told. 
 This is exactly what Trotsky says. 
 Unable tothink out his ideas or to get his arguments to hang together, he rants against group-division at one moment, and at the next shouts: “Splitting tactics are winning one suicidalvictory after another”. 
 (No. 
 1, p. 
 6. 
) This statement can have only one meaning: “The Prav-dists are winning one victory after another” (this is an objec-tive, verifiable fact, established by a study of the mass work-ing-class movement in Russia during, say, 1912 and 1913), but I , Trotsky , denounce the Pravdists (1) as splitters, and 2) as suicidal politicians. 
 Let us examine this. 
First of all we must express our thanks to Trotsky. 
 Not long ago (from August 1912 to February 1914) he was at one with F. 
 Dan, who, as is well known, threatened to “kill” anti-liquidationism, and called upon others to do so. 
 At present Trotsky does not threaten to “kill” our trend(and our Party—don’t be angry, Citizen Trotsky, this istrue!), he only prophesies that it will kill itself ! This is much milder, isn’t it? It is almost “non-factional”, isn’t it? But joking apart (although joking is the only way of retorting mildly to Trotsky’s insufferable phrase-mongering). 
 “Suicide” is a mere empty phrase, mere “Trotskyism”. 
Splitting tactics are a grave political accusation. 
 This accusation is repeated against us in a thousand different keys by the liquidators and by all the groups enumerated above, who, from the point of view of Paris and Vienna,actually exist. 
 And all of them repeat this grave political accusation in an amazingly frivolous way. 
 Look at Trotsky. 
 He admit-ted that “splitting tactics are winning [read: the Pravdists are winning] one suicidal victory after another”. 
 To thishe adds: “Numerous advanced workers , in a state of utter political bewilder-ment , themselves often become active agents of a split . 
” (No. 
 1, p. 
 6. 
) Are not these words a glaring example of irresponsibility on this question? You accuse us of being splitters when all that we see in front of us in the arena of the working-class movement inRussia is liquidationism. 
 So you think that our attitudetowards liquidationism is wrong? Indeed, all the groups abroad that we enumerated above, no matter how much they may differ from each other, are agreed that our attitudetowards liquidationism is wrong, that it is the attitude of“splitters”. 
 This, too, reveals the similarity (and fairly closepolitical kinship) between all these groups and the liquida-tors. 
 If our attitude towards liquidationism is wrong in theory, in principle, then Trotsky should say so straightforwardly , and state definitely , without equivocation, why he thinks it is wrong. 
 But Trotsky has been evading this extremelyimportant point for years . 
 If our attitude towards liquidationism has been proved wrong in practice, by the experience of the movement, then this experience should be analysed; but Trotsky fails to dothis either. 
 “Numerous advanced workers,” he admits,“become active agents of a split” (read: active agents of the Pravdist line, tactics, system and organisation). 
 What is the cause of the deplorable fact, which, as Trotsky admits, is confirmed by experience, that the advanced work-ers, the numerous advanced workers at that, stand for Pravda ? It is the “utter political bewilderment” of these advanced workers, answers Trotsky. 
 Needless to say, this explanation is highly flattering to Trotsky, to all five groups abroad, and to the liquidators. 
 Trotsky is very fond of using, with the learned air of theexpert, pompous and high-sounding phrases to explain historical phenomena in a way that is flattering to Trotsky. 
 Since “numerous advanced workers” become “active agents” of a political and Party line which does not conform to Tro-tsky’s line, Trotsky settles the question unhesitatingly, outof hand: these advanced workers are “in a state of utterpolitical bewilderment”, whereas he, Trotsky, is evidently“in a state” of political firmness and clarity, and keeps tothe right line !... And this very same Trotsky, beating his breast, fulminates against factionalism, parochialism,- and the efforts of intellectuals to impose their will on theworkers! Reading things like these, one cannot help asking oneself: is it from a lunatic asylum that such voices come? The Party put the question of liquidationism, and of condemning it, before the “advanced workers” as far back as 1908, while the question of “splitting” away from a verydefinite group of liquidators (namely, the Nasha Zarya group), i. 
e. 
, that the only way to build up the Party waswithout this group and in opposition to it—this question was raised in January 1912, over two years ago. 
 The over-whelming majority of the advanced workers declared in favour of supporting the “January (1912) line”. 
 Trotsky himself admits this fact when he talks about “victories”and about “numerous advanced workers”. 
 But Trotskywriggles out of this simply by hurling abuse at these advanced workers and calling them “splitters” and “politically bewildered”! From these facts sane people will draw a different con-clusion. 
 Where the majority of the class-conscious workers have rallied around precise and definite decisions, there weshall find unity of opinion and action, there we shall find the Party spirit, and the Party. 
 Where we see liquidators who have been “removed from office” by the workers, or half a dozen groups outside Rus-sia, who for two years have produced no proof that they are connected with the mass working-class movement in Russia,there, indeed, we shall find bewilderment and splits . 
 In now trying to persuade the workers not to carry out the deci-sions of that “united whole”, which the Marxist Pravdists recognise, Trotsky is trying to disrupt the movement and cause a split. 
 These efforts are futile, but we must expose the arrogantly conceited leaders of intellectualist groups, who, while caus-ing splits themselves, are shouting about others causing splits; who, after sustaining utter defeat at the hands of the “advanced workers” for the past two years or more, arewith incredible insolence flouting the decisions and the will of these advanced workers and saying that they are “politi-cally bewildered”. 
 These are entirely the methods of Nozd-rev, 163 or of “Judas” Golovlyov . 
164 In reply to these repeated outcries about a split and in fulfilment of my duty as a publicist, I will not tire of repeating precise , unrefuted and irrefutable figures. 
 In the Second Duma, 47 per cent of the deputies elected by theworker curia were Bolsheviks, in the Third Duma 50 per cent were Bolsheviks, and in the Fourth Duma 67 per cent. 
 There you have the majority of the “advanced workers”, there you have the Party; there you have unity of opinion and action of the majority of the class-conscious workers. 
 To this the liquidators say (see Bulkin, L. 
 M. 
, in Nasha Zarya No. 
 3) that we base our arguments on the Stolypin curias. 
 This is a foolish and unscrupulous argument. 
 TheGermans measure their successes by the results of electionsconducted under the Bismarckian electoral law, whichexcludes women. 
 Only people bereft of their senses wouldreproach the German Marxists for measuring their successesunder the existing electoral law, without in the least justifying its reactionary restrictions. 
 And we, too, without justifying curias, or the curia system, measured our successes under the existing electoral law. 
 There were curias in all three (Second, Third and Fourth)Duma elections; and within the worker curia, within the ranks of Social-Democracy, there was a complete swing against the liquidators. 
 Those who do not wish to deceivethemselves and others must admit this objective fact,namely, the victory of working-class unity over the liquida-tors. 
 The other argument is just as “clever”: “Mensheviks and liquidators voted for (or took part in the election of) such-and-such a Bolshevik. 
” Splendid! But does not the same thing apply to the 53 per cent non-Bolshevik deputies re-turned to the Second Duma, and to the 50 per cent returned to the Third Duma, and to the 33 per cent returned to the Fourth Duma? If, instead of the figures on the deputies elected, we could obtain the figures on the electors, or workers’ delegates,etc. 
, we would gladly quote them. 
 But these more detailedfigures are not available, and consequently the “disputants” are simply throwing dust in people’s eyes. 
 But what about the figures of the workers’ groups that assisted the newspapers of the different trends? During two years (1912 and 1913), 2,801 groups assisted Pravda , and 750 assisted Luch . 
 * These figures are verifiable and nobody has attempted to disprove them. 
 Where is the unity of action and will of the majority of the “advanced workers”, and where is the flouting of the will of the majority? Trotsky’s “non-factionalism” is, actually, splitting tac-tics, in that it shamelessly flouts the will of the majorityof the workers. 
 III. 
 THE BREAK-UP OF THE AUGUST BLOC But there is still another method, and a very important one, of verifying the correctness and truthfulness of Tro-tsky’s accusations about splitting tactics. 
 You consider that it is the “Leninists” who are splitters? Very well, let us assume that you are right. 
 But if you are, why have not all the other sections and groups proved that unity is possible with the liquidatorswithout the “Leninists ”, and against the “splitters”?... If we are splitters, why have not you, uniters, united amongyourselves, and with the liquidators? Had you done thatyou would have proved to the workers by deeds that unity is possible and beneficial!... Let us go over the chronology of events. 
In January 1912, the “Leninist ” “splitters” declared that they were a Party without and against the liquidators. 
 In March 1912, all the groups and “factions”: liquidators, Trotskyists, Vperyodists, “pro-Party Bolsheviks” and “pro-*A preliminary calculation made up to April 1, 1914, showed 4,000 groups for Pravda (commencing with January 1, 1912) and 1,000 for the liquidators and all their allies taken together. 
 Party Mensheviks”, in their Russian news sheets and in the columns of the German Social-Democratic newspaper Vorwärts , united against these “splitters”. 
 All of them unan-imously, in chorus, in unison and in one voice vilified usand called us “usurpers”, “mystifiers”, and other no lessaffectionate and tender names. 
 Very well, gentlemen! But what could have been easier for you than to unite against the “usurpers” and to set the “advanced workers” an example of unity ? Do you mean to say that if the advanced workers had seen, on the one hand,the unity of all against the usurpers, the unity of liquidatorsand non-liquidators, and on the other, isolated “usurpers”, “splitters”, and so forth, they would not have supported theformer? If disagreements are only invented, or exaggerated, and so forth, by the “Leninists”, and if unity between the liqui-dators, Plekhanovites, Vperyodists, Trotskyists, and soforth, is really possible , why have you not proved this dur-ing the past two years by your own example? In August 1912, a conference of “uniters” was convened. 
 Disunity started at once: the Plekhanovites refused to attend at all; the Vperyodists attended, but walked out after pro-testing and exposing the fictitious character of the wholebusiness. 
 The liquidators, the Letts, the Trotskyists (Trotsky and Semkovsky), the Caucasians, and the Seven “united”. 
 But did they? We stated at the time that they did not, that this was merely a screen to cover up liquidationism. 
 Have theevents disproved our statement? Exactly eighteen months later, in February 1914, we found: 1. 
 that the Seven was breaking up. 
 Buryanov had left them. 
 2. 
 that in the remaining new “Six”, Chkheidze and Tulyakov, or somebody else, could not see eye to eye on thereply-to be made to Plekhanov. 
 They stated in the pressthat they would reply to him, but they could not . 
 3. 
 that Trotsky, who for many months had practically vanished from the columns of Luch , had broken away , and had started “his own” journal, Borba . 
 By calling this jour-nal “non-factional”, Trotsky clearly (clearly to those who are at all familiar with the subject) intimates that in his, Trotsky’s, opinion, Nasha Zarya and Luch had proved to be “factional”, i. 
e. 
, poor uniters. 
 If you are a uniter, my dear Trotsky, if you say that it is possible to unite with the liquidators, if you and theystand by the “fundamental ideas formulated in August1912” ( Borba No. 
 1, p. 
 6, Editorial Note), why did not you yourself unite with the liquidators in Nasha Zarya and Luch ? When, before Trotsky’s journal appeared, Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta published some scathing comment stating that the physiognomy of this journal was “unclear” and thatthere had been “quite a good deal of talk in Marxist circles”about this journal, Put Pravdy (No. 
 37) * was naturally ob-liged to expose this falsehood. 
 It said: “There has been talk in Marxist circles” about a secret memorandum written byTrotsky against the Luch group; Trotsky’s physiognomy and his breakaway from the August bloc were perfectly “clear”. 
 4. 
 An, the well-known leader of the Caucasian liquidators, who had attacked L. 
 Sedov (for which he was given a pub-lic wigging by F. 
 Dan and Co. 
), now appeared in Borba . 
 It remains “unclear” whether the Caucasians now desire togo with Trotsky or with Dan. 
 5. 
 The Lettish Marxists, who were the only real organisa-tion in the “August bloc”, had formally withdrawn from it, stating (in 1914) in the resolution of their last Congress that: “the attempt on the part of the conciliators to unite at all cost with the liquidators (the August Conference of 1912 ) proved fruitless , and the uniters themselves became ideologically and politically depend-ent upon the liquidators . 
” This statement was made, after eighteen months experience, by an organisation which had itself been neutral and had not desired to establish connection with either of the two centres. 
 This decision of neutrals should carry all the more weight with Trotsky! Enough, is it not?Those who accused us of being splitters, of being unwill-ing or unable to get on with the liquidators, were themselves *See pp. 
 158-61 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 unable to get on with them. 
 The August bloc proved to be a fiction and broke up. 
 By concealing this break-up from his readers, Trotsky is deceiving them. 
 The experience of our opponents has proved that we are right, has proved that the liquidators cannot be co-operatedwith. 
 IV. 
 A CONCILIATOR’S ADVICE TO THE “SEVEN” The editorial article in issue No. 
 1 of Borba entitled “The Split in the Duma Group” contains advice from a concilia-tor to the seven pro-liquidator (or inclining towards liquida-tionism) members of the Duma. 
 The gist of this advice is contained in the following words: “first of all consult the Six whenever it is necessary to reach an agreement with other groups.... 
” (P. 
 29. 
) This is the wise counsel which, among other things, is evidently the cause of Trotsky’s disagreement with the liq-uidators of Luch . 
 This is the opinion the Pravdists have held ever since the outbreak of the conflict between the two groupsin the Duma, ever since the resolution of the Summer (1913)Conference was adopted. 
 The Russian Social-DemocraticLabour group in the Duma has reiterated in the press , even after the split, that it continues to adhere to this position, in spite of the repeated refusals of the Seven. 
 From the very outset, since the time the resolution of the Summer Conference was adopted, we have been, and stillare, of the opinion that agreements on questions concerning activities in the Duma are desirable and possible; if such agreements have been repeatedly arrived at with the petty-bourgeois peasant democrats (Trudoviks), they are all themore possible and necessary with the petty-bourgeois, lib-eral-labour politicians. 
 We must not exaggerate disagreements, but we must face the facts: the Seven are men, leaning towards liquidationism, who yesterday entirely followed the lead of Dan, and whose eyes today are travelling longingly from Dan to Trotskyand back again. 
 The liquidators are a group of legalists whohave broken away from the Party and are pursuing a liberal-labour policy. 
 Since they repudiate the “underground”, there can be no question of unity with them In matters concerning Party organisation and the working-class movement. 
 Who-ever thinks differently is badly mistaken and fails to takeinto account the profound nature of the changes that havetaken place since 1908. 
 But agreements on certain questions with this group, which stands outside or on the fringe of the Party, are, of course, permissible: we must always compel this group, too, like the Trudoviks, to choose between the workers’ (Pravdist)policy and the liberal policy. 
 For example, on the questionof fighting for freedom of the press the liquidators clearlyrevealed vacillation between the liberal formulation of thequestion, which repudiated, or overlooked, the illegal press, and the opposite policy, that of the workers. 
 Within the scope of a Duma policy in which the most important extra-Duma issues are not directly raised, agree-ments with the seven liberal-labour deputies are possibleand desirable. 
 On this point Trotsky has shifted his groundfrom that of the liquidators to that of the Party Summer (1913) Conference. 
 It should not be forgotten, however, that to a group standing outside the Party, agreement means somethingentirely different from what Party people usually understandby the term. 
 By “agreement” in the Duma, non-Partypeople mean “ drawing up a tactical resolution, or line”. 
 To Party people agreement is an attempt to enlist others in the work of carrying out the Party line. 
 For example, the Trudoviks have no party. 
 By agreement they understand the “voluntary”, so to speak, “drawingup” of a line, today with the Cadets, tomorrow with theSocial-Democrats. 
 We, however, understand something entirely different by agreement with the Trudoviks. 
 We have Party decisions on all the important questions of tac-tics, and we shall never depart from these decisions; byagreement with the Trudoviks we mean winning them over to our side, convincing them that we are right, and not reject-ing joint action against the Black Hundreds and against the liberals. 
 How far Trotsky has forgotten (not for nothing has he associated with the liquidators) this elementary difference /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR between the Party and non-Party point of view on agree-ments, is shown by the following argument of his: “The representatives of the International must bring together the two sections of our divided parliamentary group and jointly withthem ascertain the points of agreement and points of disagreement.... 
 A detailed tactical resolution formulating the principles of parlia-mentary tactics may be drawn up.... 
” (No. 
 1, pp. 
 29-30. 
) Here you have a characteristic and typical example of the liquidationist presentation of the question! Trotsky’sjournal forgets about the Party; such a trifle is hardlyworth remembering! When different parties in Europe (Trotsky is fond of inap-propriately talking about Europeanism) come to an agree-ment or unite, what they do is this: their respective repre-sentatives meet and first of all ascertain the points of disag-reement (precisely what the International proposed in rela-tion to Russia, without including in the resolutionKautsky’s ill-considered statement that “the old Partyno longer exists” 165). 
 Having ascertained the points of dis-agreement, the representatives decide what decisions (resolu-tions, conditions, etc. 
) on questions of tactics, organisation,etc. 
, should be submitted to the congresses of the two parties . 
 If they succeed in drafting unanimous decisions, the con-gresses decide whether to adopt them or not. 
 If differing pro-posals are made, they too are submitted for final decision to the congresses of the two parties. 
 What appeals to the liquidators and Trotsky is only the European models of opportunism, but certainly not the mod-els of European partisanship. 
 “A detailed tactical resolution” will be drawn up by the members of the Duma! This example should serve the Rus-sian “advanced workers”, with whom Trotsky has good rea-son to be so displeased, as a striking illustration of thelengths to which the groups in Vienna and Paris—who per-suaded even Kautsky that there was “no Party” in Russia—go in their ludicrous project-mongering. 
 But if it is some-times possible to fool foreigners on this score, the Russian “advanced workers” (at the risk of provoking the terrible Trotsky to another outburst of displeasure) will laugh in thefaces of these project-mongers. 
 “Detailed tactical resolutions,” they will tell them, “are drawn up among us (we do not know how it is done among you non-Party people) by Party congresses and conferences, for example, those of 1907, 1908, 1910, 1912 and 1913. 
 Weshall gladly acquaint uninformed foreigners, as well as for-getful Russians, with our Party decisions, and still moregladly ask the representatives of the Seven, or the Augustbloc members, or Left-wingers or anybody else, to acquaint us with the resolutions of their congresses, or conferences, and to bring up at their next congress the definite questionof the attitude they should adopt towards our resolutions,or towards the resolution of the neutral Lettish Congressof 1914, etc. 
” This is what the “advanced workers” of Russia will say to the various project-mongers, and this has already been said in the Marxist press, for example, by the organised Marxistsof St. 
 Petersburg. 
 Trotsky chooses to ignore these publishedterms for the liquidators? So much the worse for Trotsky. 
 Itis our duty to warn our readers how ridiculous that “unity”(the August type of “unity”?) project-mongering is which refuses to reckon with the will of the majority of the class-conscious workers of Russia. 
 V. 
 TROTSKY’S LIQUIDATIONIST VIEWS As to the substance of his own views, Trotsky contrived to say as little as possible in his new journal. 
 Put Pravdy (No. 
 37) has already commented on the fact that Trotskyhas not said a word either on the question of the “under-ground” or on the slogan of working for a legal party, etc. 
 * That, among other things, is why we say that when attemptsare made to form a separate organisation which is to have no ideological and political physiognomy, it is the worst form of factionalism. 
 Although Trotsky has refrained from openly expounding his views, quite a number of passages in his journal showwhat kind of ideas he has been trying to smuggle in. 
 In the very first editorial article in the first issue of his journal, we read the following: *See pp. 
 158-61 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 “The pro-revolutionary Social-Democratic Party in our country was a workers ’ party only in ideas and aims. 
 Actually, it was an or-ganisation of the Marxist intelligentsia, which led the awakeningworking class. 
” (5. 
) This is the old liberal and liquidationist tune, which is really the prelude to the repudiation of the Party. 
 It is based on a distortion of the historical facts. 
 The strikes of 1895-96had already given rise to a mass working-class movement, which both in ideas and organisation was linked with the Social-Democratic movement. 
 And in these strikes, in thiseconomic and non-economic agitation, the “intelligentsialed the working class”!? Or take the following exact statistics of political offences in the period 1901-03 compared with the preceding period.

0 We see that in the eighties, when there was as yet no Social-Democratic Party in Russia, and when the movement was “Narodnik”, the intelligentsia predominated, accountingfor over half the participants. 
 But the picture underwent a complete change in 1901-03, when a Social-Democratic Party already existed, and whenthe old Iskra was conducting its work. 
 The intelligentsia were now a minority among the participants of the movement; the workers (“industry and commerce ”) were far more numer-ous than the intelligentsia, and the workers and peasantstogether constituted more than half the total. 
 It was precisely in the conflict of trends within the Marxist movement that the petty-bourgeois intellectualist wing of the Social-Democracy made itself felt, beginning with Economism (1895-1903) and continuing with Menshev-ism (1903-1908) and liquidationism (1908-1914). 
 Trotsky repeats the liquidationist slander against the Party and is afraid to mention the history of the twenty years’ conflict of trends within the Party. 
 Here is another example. 
 “In its attitude towards parliamentarism, Russian Social-Democ-racy passed through the same three stages ... [as in other countries]... first ‘boycottism’ ... then the acceptance in principle of parlia-mentary tactics, but ... [that magnificent “but”, the “but” whichShchedrin translated as: The ears never grow higher than the forehead,never! *] ... for purely agitational purposes ... and lastly, the presen-tation from the Duma rostrum ... of current demands.... 
” (No. 
 1, p. 
 34. 
) This, too, is a liquidationist distortion of history. 
 The distinction between the second and third stages was invent-ed in order to smuggle in a defence of reformism and oppor-tunism. 
 Boycottism as a stage in “the attitude of Social-Democracy towards parliamentarism” never existed either in Europe (where anarchism has existed and continues toexist) or in Russia, where the boycott of the Bulygin Duma, for example, applied only to a definite institution, was never linked with “parliamentarism”, and was engendered by the peculiar nature of the struggle between liberalism and Marx-ism for the continuation of the onslaught. 
 Trotsky doesnot breathe a word about the way this struggle affected theconflict between the two trends in Marxism! When dealing with history, one must explain concrete questions and the class roots of the different trends; anybody who wants to make a Marxist study of the struggle of classes and trends over the question of participation in theBulygin Duma, will see therein the roots of the liberal-labour policy. 
 But Trotsky “deals with” history only inorder to evade concrete questions and to invent a justification, or a semblance of justification, for the present-day oppor-tunists! “Actually, all trends,” he writes, “employ the same methods of struggle and organisation. 
” “The outcries about the liberal danger in our working-class movement are simply a crude and sectarian trav-esty of reality. 
” (No. 
 1, pp. 
 5 and 35. 
) This is a very clear and very vehement defence of the liquidators. 
 But we will take the liberty of quoting at least *Meaning the impossible. 
— Ed. 
 one small fact, one of the very latest. 
 Trotsky merely slings words about; we should like the workers themselves to pon-der over the facts. 
 It is a fact that Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta for March 13 wrote the following: “Instead of emphasising the definite and concrete task that con-fronts the working class , viz. 
, to compel the Duma to throw out the bill [on the press ], a vague formula is proposed of fighting for the ‘uncur-tailed slogans ’, and at the same time the illegal press is widely adver-tised , which can only lead to the relaxation of the workers ’ struggle for their legal press . 
” This is a clear, precise and documentary defence of the liquidationist policy and a criticism of the Pravda policy. 
 Well, will any literate person say that both trends employ “the same methods of struggle and organisation” on this question? Will any literate person say that the liquidatorsare not pursuing a liberal-labour policy on this question, that the liberal menace to the working-class movement ispurely imaginary? The reason why Trotsky avoids facts and concrete refer-ences is because they relentlessly refute all his angry outcries and pompous phrases. 
 It is very easy, of course, to strike anattitude and say: “a crude and sectarian travesty”. 
 Or toadd a still more stinging and pompous catch-phrase, suchas “emancipation from conservative factionalism”. 
 But is this not very cheap? Is not this weapon bor-rowed from the arsenal of the period when Trotsky posed in all his splendour before audiences of high-school boys? Nevertheless, the “advanced workers”, with whom Trotsky is so angry, would like to be told plainly and clearly:Do you or do you not approve of the “method of struggleand organisation” that is definitely expressed in the above-quoted appraisal of a definite political campaign? If you do, then you are pursuing a liberal-labour policy, betrayingMarxism and the Party; to talk of “peace” or of “unity” with such a policy, with groups which pursue such a policy, means deceiving yourself and others. 
 If not, then say so plainly. 
 Phrases will not astonish, sat-isfy or intimidate the present-day workers. 
 Incidentally, the policy advocated by the liquidators in the above-quoted passage is a foolish one even from the liberal point of view, for the passage of a bill in the Duma depends on “Zemstvo-Octobrists” of the type of Bennigsen, who has already shown his hand in the committee. 
 * * * The old participants in the Marxist movement in Russia know Trotsky very well, and there is no need to discuss him for their benefit. 
 But the younger generation of workers do not know him, and it is therefore necessary to discuss him,for he is typical of all the five groups abroad, which, infact, are also vacillating between the liquidators and theParty. 
 In the days of the old Iskra (1901-03), these waverers, who flitted from the Economists to the Iskrists and back again, were dubbed “Tushino turncoats” (the name given in theTroublous Times in Rus to fighting men who went over fromone camp to another 166). 
 When we speak of liquidationism we speak of a definite ideological trend, which grew up in the course of many years, stems from Menshevism and Economism in the twenty years’ history of Marxism, and is connected withthe policy and ideology of a definite class—the liberalbourgeoisie. 
 The only ground the “Tushino turncoats” have for claim-ing that they stand above groups is that they “borrow” their ideas from one group one day and from another the next day. 
 Trotsky was an ardent Iskrist in 1901-03, and Ryazanovdescribed his role at the Congress of 1903 as “Lenin’s cud-gel”. 
 At the end of 1903, Trotsky was an ardent Menshevik,i. 
e. 
, he deserted from the Iskrists to the Economists. 
 He saidthat “between the old Iskra and the new lies a gulf”. 
 In 1904-05, he deserted the Mensheviks and occupied a vacil-lating position, now co-operating with Martynov (the Econ-omist), now proclaiming his absurdly Left “permanentrevolution” theory. 
 In 1906-07, he approached the Bolshe-viks, and in the spring of 1907 he declared that he was inagreement with Rosa Luxemburg. 
 In the period of disintegration, after long “non-factional” vacillation he again went to the right, and in August 1912,he entered into a bloc with the liquidators. 
 He has now deserted them again, although in substance he reiterates their shoddy ideas. 
 Such types are characteristic of the flotsam of past histor-ical formations, of the time when the mass working-classmovement in Russia was still dormant, and when everygroup had “ample room” in which to pose as a trend, groupor faction, in short, as a “power”, negotiating amalgamationwith others. 
 The younger generation of workers should know exactly whom they are dealing with, when individuals come beforethem with incredibly pretentious claims, unwilling abso-lutely to reckon with either the Party decisions, which since 1908 have defined and established our attitude towardsliquidationism, or with the experience of the present-day working-class movement in Russia, which has actually brought about the unity of the majority on the basis of full recognition of the aforesaid decisions. 
 BOOK REVIEW I.

 One cannot but welcome Mr. 
 Drozdov’s initiative in raising, in his pamphlet, an extremely interesting and im-portant question. 
 The author has taken the figures of the daily wages (expressed in terms both of money and of grain), the rye crop yield on private landlord fields during 1902-04,and the annual figures for the period 1905-10, and comparedthese data for different parts of European Russia. 
 The author found the biggest pay rises for 1905 in the south-western region (a ten per cent rise compared with 1902-04). 
 The average increase for Russia was 1. 
2 per cent in 1905, and 12. 
5 per cent in 1906. 
 From this the authordraws the conclusion that wages rose most in regions inwhich agricultural capitalism is most developed, and thestrike form of struggle (as distinct from what is known asthe “riot and wreck ” form) is most widespread. 
 Strictly speaking, these figures are inadequate to support this con-clusion. 
 For example, the second highest rise in wages oc-curred in 1905 in the Urals region (a rise of 9. 
68 per cent,as against 10. 
35 per cent in the south-western region). 
If we take average wages for the whole of the post-revolu-tionary period, i. 
e. 
, 1905-10, we shall get an index number of 110. 
3 (taking 1902-04 at 100) in the south-western re-gion, and 121. 
7 in the Urals. 
 The author, as it were, makes an“exception” for the Urals, on the basis of my book The Development of Capitalism . 
 But in that book I made an exception for the Urals in studying workers’ mass migration , not the level of wages in general. 
 * The author’s reference *See present edition, Vol. 
 3, p. 
 586. 
— Ed. 
 to my book, therefore, is wrong. 
 Nor can his reference to the very small percentage of private landlord farming inthe Urals * be regarded as satisfactory. 
 The author should have taken the more detailed gubernia figures and comparedthe rise in wages with the figures showing the relativestrength of the agrarian movement in general, and of its strike form, “riot and wreck” form, and so on. 
 On the whole, the money wages of agricultural labourers throughout Russia rose most between 1905 and 1906. 
 Tak-ing the wages of 1902-04 at 100, the index number for 1905and 1906 will be 101. 
2 and 112. 
5 respectively. 
 The indexnumbers for the ensuing four years are: 114. 
2, 113. 
1, 118. 
4and 119. 
6. 
 It is clear that with the general rise in money wages as a result of the revolution, we see the direct and predominating influence of the struggle of 1905-06. 
 Referring our readers to Mr. 
 Drozdov’s excellent pam-phlet for the details, we shall observe here that the authorhas no grounds whatever for describing as “manifestly im-practicable” those demands of the peasants which virtuallyamounted to “smoking out the landlords” (p. 
 30). 
 Equallygroundless and unreasoned is his statement that in the “riot and wreck” regions the “struggle was waged for equalised land tenure, and, in general, for other equally petty-bourgeois, utopian demands” (p. 
 38). 
 Firstly, the peasantsfought, not only for land tenure, but for landownership(“smoking out”); secondly, they fought, not for equalisedtenure, but for the transfer to them of the landed estates— that is something entirely different. 
 Thirdly, what was and remains utopian is the subjective hopes (and “ theories ”) of the Narodniks in the matter of “equality”, “socialisation”,“taking the land out of commercial circulation”, and similarnonsense; but there was nothing “utopian” in the petty-bour-geois masses “smoking out” the feudalists. 
 The author con-fuses the objective historical significance of the peasants’ struggle for land—a struggle that was progressive-bourgeoisand radical-bourgeois—with the subjective theories andhopes of the Narodniks, which were, and still are, utopian *In this connection the author puts the northern region on a par with the Urals. 
 But in the northern region, wages in 1905 droppedby six per cent, and in 1906 showed only an eight per cent rise. 
 and reactionary. 
 Such confusion is profoundly erroneous, undialectical and unhistorical. 
 Comparing the averages for 1891-1900 with those for 1901-10, the author draws the general conclusion that dailymoney wages all over Russia rose by 25. 
5 per cent, while real wages, expressed in terms of grain, rose only by 3. 
9 per cent, i. 
e. 
, underwent hardly any change at all. 
 Wewould remark that, arranged to reflect money-wage rises during the above-mentioned decades, the order of the var-ious regions is as follows: Lithuania 39 per cent, the Volgaarea 33 per cent, the Urals 30 per cent, the Ukraine 28 percent, the central agricultural region 26 per cent, etc. 
 In conclusion, the author compares the rise in agricultural labourers’ wages during the past two decades (1891-1900 and 1901-10) with the rise in ground-rent. 
 It appears that for the whole of Russia, average wages rose from 52. 
2 kopeksper day to 66. 
3 kopeks, i. 
e. 
, by 27 per cent. 
 However, theprice of land—it is well known that the price of land iscapitalised rent—rose from 69. 
1 rubles per dessiatine to132. 
4 rubles, that is , by 91 per cent. 
 In other words, wages rose by one-fourth, while ground-rent almost doubled ! “And this circumstance,” the author rightly concludes, “signifies only one thing, namely: the deterioration in therelative standard of living of the agricultural labourersin Russia, with a simultaneous relative rise in the standardof living of the landowning class .... 
 The social gulf be-tween the landlord class and the class of wage-labourers is steadily widening.

 CLARITY HAS BEEN ACHIEVED CLASS -CONSCIOUS WORKERS , PLEASE NOTE In Put Pravdy No. 
 63, the Russian Social-Democratic Labour group made a last attempt to ascertain whetherthe six deputies (the Chkheidze group) now intend—afterthe vast majority of the class-conscious workers have con-demned their alliance with the liquidators—to take steps towards an agreement with the Russian Social-DemocraticLabour group in the Duma. 
 167 The Russian Social-Democratic Labour group asked the “Social-Democratic group” whether it now intended unre-servedly to recognise the decisions of the entire Marxist body of 1903 (the Programme) and of 1908-10 (condemnation of the liquidators). 
 Why the Russian Social-DemocraticLabour group put this question in the forefront, is clear. 
The decisions of 1903, 1908 and 1910 were adopted prior to any splits between the Marxists and the liquidators. 
 These decisions are the banner of all Marxists. 
 If any agree-ment between the Russian Social-Democratic Labour group and the “Social-Democratic group” is at all possible, then it isof course possible only on the basis of the unqualified recog-nition of these decisions, which were adopted before the split. 
 In issue No. 
 2 of Nasha Rabochaya Gazeta , the Chkheidze group published an “Open Reply” in which clarity is at last achieved and which therefore deserves the most serious at-tention from all workers who seriously try to understandthe causes of the disagreements, and want genuine unity. 
 1. 
 THE PROGRAMME AND THE NATIONAL QUESTION At the Marxist Congress which drew up the Programme (1903), the Bundists (Jewish liquidators) proposed that a de-mand be included in the Programme for “the establishment of institutions that will guarantee them complete free-dom of cultural development”. 
 This was opposed by the present-day liquidators Martynov, Martov and Koltsov. 
 They argued, quite correctly, that this demand ran counterto the international principles of Social-Democracy. 
 Thisdemand was rejected by all votes against the vote of the Bundists (see the Minutes). 
 Marxists assert that the “establishment of institutions” is the same “cultural-national autonomy”, which Social-Democracy rejects. 
 In their “Open Reply” the six deputies assert the con-trary. 
 They say: we advocated the “establishment ofinstitutions”, but we did not advocate cultural-nationalautonomy. 
 Very well, we say in reply; let us assume for a moment that the two are not the same. 
 But the Congress also rejected the “establishment of institutions ”. 
 You know that perfectly well. 
 You know that, to please the nationalists, you have retreated from the Programme . 
 It was for this violation of the Programme that the Bundists, whose proposals the Congress rejected, complimented you. 
 After the Social-Democratic group made its declaration at the opening of the Fourth Duma, they wrote: “It may be pointed out that the formula of the Social-Democrats [i. 
e. 
, liquidators] lacked clarity. 
 That is quite true. 
 But the impor-tant thing is that the workers ’ deputies [i. 
e. 
, Chkheidze’s supporters] abandoned the rigid point of view on which the official theory on the national question is based. 
” ( Zeit No. 
 9, editorial, column 3. 
) The “official theory” is nothing more nor less than the Programme . 
 The Bundists compliment Chkheidze and his friends for infringing the Programme . 
 The Russian Social-Democratic Labour group asked: Is the “Social-Democraticgroup” willing to retract this infringement of the Pro-gramme? The reply was clear: “This formula [i. 
e. 
, establish-ment of institutions] contains absolutely nothing thatthe Social-Democratic group should retract” (cf. 
 “OpenReply”). 
 We refuse to retract this infringement of the Pro-gramme—such was the reply of the “Social-Democratic group”. 
 2. 
 THE DECISION OF 1908 The Russian Social-Democratic Labour group next asked the “Social-Democratic group” whether it was willing to recognise the 1908 decision of the Marxists, which was re-cently endorsed also by the Lettish conciliators. 
 This decision reads as follows: “Liquidationism is an attempt on the part of a certain section of the Party intelligentsia to liquidate [i. 
e. 
, to dissolve, destroy, abolish, put an end to] the existing Party organisation, and to sub-stitute for it an amorphous federation acting within legal bounds [i. 
e. 
, within the law, in open existence] at all costs, even at the costof openly abandoning the programme, tactics and traditions [i. 
e. 
,the preceding experience] of the Party. 
 ” And this decision goes on to say that “ it is necessary to wage a most relentless ideological and organisational struggle against these liquidationist attempt s” (cf. 
 Report, p. 
 38). 
168 This decision was adopted by the united Marxist body in the presence of representatives of all groups, includingthe liquidators (Dan, Axelrod and others), the Bundists, and so forth. 
 It was adopted in December 1908, before there were any splits. 
 The Russian Social-Democratic Labour group asked the Chkheidze group whether it accepted this 1908 decision, which condemned liquidationism. 
 What did the Chkheidze group say in reply? Not a word ! Not a sound! It treated the decision of 1908 as though it did not exist. 
 Incredible, but a fact. 
 And this silence is more eloquent than words. 
 It reveals an incred-ibly arrogant disregard for decisions. 
 Decisions that are not to my liking are simply non-existent—such are the ethicsof the liquidationist deputies. 
 The latter acted in the same way when it came to accept-ing deputy Jagiello into the group. 
 It was pointed out tothem that the 1908 decision rejected “unity” with Jagiello’snon-Social-Democratic party. 
 But to this they replied that in 1907, i. 
e. 
, a year before this decision was adopted, theSocial-Democratic group in the Second Duma had acceptedas members the Lithuanian deputies who were unquestion-ably Social-Democrats. 
 This means openly mocking at decisions. 
 3. 
 THE 1910 DECISION This decision reads as follows: “The historical situation in the Social-Democratic movement in the period of bourgeois counter-revolution inevitably gives rise— as a manifestation of the bourgeois influence on the proletariat —on the one hand, to repudiation of the illegal Social-Democratic Party, belittling of its role and importance, and attempts to whittle down the programmatic and tactical tasks and the slogans of consistentSocial-Democracy, etc. 
, and on the other hand, to repudiation of Social-Democratic activities in the Duma and of the utilisation of legal possibilities, failure to understand the importance of eitherinability to apply consistent Social-Democratic tactics to the spe-cific historical conditions prevailing at the present time, etc. 
 “An inalienable element of Social-Democratic, tactics under these conditions is the elimination of both these deviations by extending and intensifying Social-Democratic activities in all fields of the pro-letarian class struggle, and explanation of the dangers of these devia-tions. 
” This decision was adopted unanimously , prior to any splits, in the presence of representatives of all groups. 
 It condemns liquidationism and otzovism. 
 The Russian Social-Democratic Labour group asked the “Social-Democratic group” whether it recognised that deci-sion. 
 The latter replied: “The 1910 decisions do not evencontain the word liquidationism”. 
 The “word” is not there! But whom did the entire Marxist body have in mind when it condemned the “repudiationof the illegal Social-Democratic Party, the belittling of its role and importance”? Whom if not the liquidators? Lastly, we have a most authentic document, published three years ago and refuted by nobody, a document emanat-ing from all the “national” Marxists (Letts, Bundists andPoles), and from Trotsky (the liquidators cannot imaginebetter witnesses). 
 This document plainly states that “it would in fact be desirable to call the trend mentioned in the resolution liquidationism, which must be combated .... 
” How can the deputies have the effrontery to mislead the workers in this unblushing manner? The “Social-Democratic group” refuses to recognise the 1910 decisions! Instead, it declares that it is in “complete agreement” with the liquidationist Nasha Rabochaya Ga-zeta . 
 The 1903, 1908 and 1910 decisions of the entire Marxist body do not exist for the liquidationist deputies. 
 For them only the “decisions” of the liquidationist newspaper exist. 
 4. 
 “TRENDS” While flouting direct decisions and ignoring the will of the workers, the “Social-Democratic group” dilates on the usefulness of all “trends of Marxism”. 
 Marxists all over the world take the workers ’ organisa-tions as their basis. 
 In our country, however, some people want to take elusive “trends” as their basis. 
 In Germanyand in fact all over the world, the Social-Democrats unitethe workers , their local cells, organisations and groups. 
 In our country, some people want to unite “trends”. 
 “All trends among the Marxists”! But among the liquida-tors alone there are at least two “trends”: Borba and Nasha Rabochaya Gazeta , disputing with each other as to which of them is the best custodian of the “August precepts”. 
 The idea of uniting ten “trends”, all of them isolated from the masses, is hopeless. 
 The idea of uniting all workers willing to build up the entire Marxist body is a great cause,which is being accomplished before our very eyes withthe ardent support of the Russian Social-Democratic La-bour group. 
 * * * Clarity has been achieved. 
 The overwhelming majority of the workers (see the returns of the insurance elections,group collections and the correspondence between the work-ers’ groups and the two groups in the Duma) have declared infavour of the Marxists, in favour of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour group, and against the liquidators. 
 The August bloc has broken down; the Lettish Social-Democratsand Buryanov have left them, and the supporters of An andof Borba are leaving them; the six deputies grouped around Chkheidze have joined the worst and most liquidationist fragment of the August bloc. 
 The workers must draw their own conclusions. 
 Trudovaya Pravda No. 
 7, Published according to June 5, 1914 the text in Trudovaya Pravda ADVENTURISM When Marxists say that certain groups are adventurist, they have in mind the very definite and specific socialand historical features of a phenomenon, one that everyclass-conscious worker should be familiar with. 
 The history of Russian Social-Democracy teems with tiny groups, which sprang up for an hour, for several months,with no roots whatever among the masses (and politicswithout the masses are adventurist politics), and with noserious and stable principles. 
 In a petty-bourgeois country,which is passing through a historical period of bourgeois reconstruction, it is inevitable that a motley assortment of intellectuals should join the workers, and that theseintellectuals should attempt to form all kinds ofgroups, adventurist in character in the sense referredto above. 
 Workers who do not wish to be fooled should subject every group to the closest scrutiny and ascertain how seri-ous its principles are, and what roots it has in the masses. 
Put no faith in words; subject everything to the closestscrutiny—such is the motto of the Marxist workers. 
 Let us recall the struggle between Iskrism and Econom-ism in 1895-1902. 
 These were two trends of Social-Demo-cratic thought. 
 One of them was proletarian and Marxist, which had stood the test of the three years’ campaign con-ducted by Iskra , and been tested by all advanced workers, who recognised as their own the precisely and clearly for-mulated decisions on Iskrist tactics and organisation. 
 Theother, Economism, was a bourgeois , opportunist trend, which strove to subordinate the workers to the liberals. 
 Besides these two important trends, there were a host of small and rootless groups ( Svoboda , Borba ,169 the group that published the Berlin leaflets, and so forth). 
 These have long been forgotten. 
 Though there were no few honest and conscientious Social-Democrats in these groups, they proved adventurist in the sense that they had no stable or serious principles, programme, tactics, organisation, andno roots among the masses. 
 It is thus, and only thus—by studying the history of the movement, by pondering over the ideological significance of definite theories, and by putting phrases to the test of facts—that serious people should appraise present-daytrends and groups. 
 Only simpletons put faith in words. 
Pravdism is a trend which has given precise Marxist answers and resolutions (of 1908, 1910, 1912 and 1913— in February and in the summer) on all questions of tactics, organisation and programme. 
 The continuity of these deci-sions since the time of the old Iskra (1901-03), let alone the London (1907) Congress, has been of the strictest. 
 The cor-rectness of these decisions has been proved by the five orsix years’ (1908-14) experience of all the advanced workers, who have accepted these decisions as their own . 
 Pravdism has united four-fifths of the class-conscious workers ofRussia (5,300 Social-Democratic workers’ groups out of6,700 in two -and-a-half years). 
 Liquidationism is a trend with a history that goes back almost twenty years, for it is the direct continuation of Economism (1895-1902) and the offspring of Menshevism (1903-08). 
 The liberal-bourgeois roots and the liberal-bourgeois content of this trend have been recognised inofficial decisions (1908 and 1910; small wonder that theliquidators are afraid even to publish them in full!). 
 Theliquidators’ liberal ideas are all linked up and of a piece: down with the “underground”, down with the “pillars”, for an open party, against the “strike craze”, against thehigher forms of the struggle, and so forth. 
 In liberal-bour-geois “society” the liquidators have long enjoyed the strongsympathy of the Cadets and of the non-Party (and nearParty) intellectuals. 
 Liquidationism is a serious trend, only not a Marxist, not a proletarian trend, but a liberal-bourgeois one. 
 Only witless people can talk about “peace”with the liquidators. 
 Now take the other groups which pose as “trends”. 
 We shall enumerate them: 1) the Vperyod group plus Alexinsky; 2) ditto plus Bogdanov; 3) ditto plus Voinov; 4) the Plekha-novites; 5) the “pro-Party Bolsheviks” (actually concilia-tors: Mark Sommer and his crowd); 6) the Trotskyists (i. 
e. 
,Trotsky even minus Semkovsky); 7) the “Caucasians” (i. 
e. 
,An minus the Caucasus). 
 We have enumerated the groups mentioned in the press . 
 In Russia and abroad they have stated that they want to be separate “trends” and groups. 
 We have tried to list all the Russian groups, omitting the non-Russian. 
 All these groups, without exception, represent sheer adventurism. 
 “Why? Where is the proof?” the reader will ask. 
 Proof is provided by the history of the last decade (1904-14), which is most eventful and significant. 
 During theseten years members of these groups have displayed themost helpless, most pitiful, most ludicrous vacillationon serious questions of tactics and organisation, and haveshown their utter inability to create trends with roots among the masses. 
 Take Plekhanov, the best of them. 
 The services he ren-dered in the past were immense. 
 During the twenty yearsbetween 1883 and 1903 he wrote a large number of splendidessays, especially those against the opportunists, Machistsand Narodniks. 
 But since 1903 Plekhanov has been vacillating in the most ludicrous manner on questions of tactics and organi-sation: 1) 1903, August—a Bolshevik; 2) 1903, November(Iskra No. 
 52)—in favour of peace with the “ opportunist ” Mensheviks; 3) 1903, December—a Menshevik, and an ardentone; 4) 1905, spring—after the victory of the Bolsheviks— in favour of “unity” between “brothers at strife”; 5) the end of 1905 till mid-1906—a Menshevik; 6) mid-1906—started,on and off, to move away from the Mensheviks, and in Lon-don, in 1907, censured them (Cherevanin’s admission) fortheir “organisational anarchism”; 7) 1908—a break withthe liquidators; 8) 1914—a new turn towards the liquida-tors. 
 Plekhanov advocates “unity” with them, without being able to utter an intelligible word to explain on what terms this unity is to be achieved, why unity with Mr. 
 Potresov has become possible, and what guarantees there are that any terms agreed to will be carried out. 
 After a decade of such experience we can safely say that Plekhanov is capable of producing ripples, but he hasnot produced, nor will he ever produce, a “trend”. 
 We quite understand the Pravdists, who willingly pub-lished Plekhanov’s articles against the liquidators. 
 Theycould not very well reject articles which, in full accord with the decisions of 1908-10, were directed against the liquidators. 
 Now Plekhanov has begun to repeat—withthe liquidators, with Bogdanov and the rest—phrases aboutthe unity of “all trends”. 
 We emphatically condemn thisline, which should be relentlessly combated. 
 Nowhere in the world do the workers’ parties unite groups of intellectuals and “trends”; they unite workers on the following terms: (1) recognition and application ofdefinite Marxist decisions on questions of tactics and organ-isation; (2) submission of the minority of class-consciousworkers to the majority. 
 This unity, on the basis of absolute repudiation of the opponents of the “underground”, was achieved by the Prav-dists in the course of two-and-a-half years (1912-14) to theextent of four-fifths. 
 Witless people may abuse the Prav-dists and call them factionalists, splitters, and so forth,but these phrases and abuse will not wipe out the unity ofthe workers.... 
 Plekhanov now threatens to destroy this unity of the majority. 
 We calmly and firmly say to the workers: put nofaith in words. 
 Put them to the test of facts, and you willsee that every step taken by every one of the above-men-tioned adventurist groups more and more glaringly revealstheir helpless and pitiful vacillation. 
 Rabochy No. 
 7, Published according to June 9, 1914 the text in Rabochy Signed: V. 
 Ilyin THE LIQUIDATORS AND THE DECISIONS OF THE LETTISH ISTS What worker does not remember the noise the liquida-tors raised when, in a special issue of our newspaper, we acquainted the reader with the latest decisions of the Let-tish Marxists and remarked that the Letts had paid tributeto the spirit of compromise while at the same time dealinga death blow at the liquidationist August bloc. 
 * The liquidators have used every means in their power to challenge this conclusion. 
 All the resourcefulness of Martov, all the ... truthfulness of Dan, all the wit and brilliant literary talent of Semkovsky and Yonov—everything hasbeen mobilised for this purpose. 
 The liquidators have beendetermined at all cost to “prove” that the Lettish Congressdid not condemn the liquidators, did not come out againstthe August bloc, and so on and so forth. 
 In a word, “It’s not me, it’s not my horse, I’m not the driver”. 
 ** Now, after a lapse of only two or three months, the jour-nal of the liquidators themselves ( Nasha Zarya No. 
 4) has published an article by Mr. 
 Weiss, the most “prominent”Lettish liquidator, who fully confirms our own appraisal of events. 
 Mr. 
 Weiss is a most vigorous opponent of ours. 
 He heaps harsh “criticism” on the Russian “Leninists” and the Let-tish majority. 
 However, he has the courage to openly ad-mit defeat, while promising to go on fighting for his liquida-tionist views. 
 He does not shift and shuffle; he does not,like Semkovsky, try to prove that white is black and vice versa. 
 One may sharply dispute with such an opponent, *See pp. 
 177-85 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 **A Russian proverb. 
— Ed. 
 but he nevertheless commands respect for not having re-course to the trivial methods of the Semkovskys. 
 Mr. 
 Weiss writes: “The predominant tendency there [at the Congress] among the Lettish Marxists, by a majority of one, and, on some questions, amajority of two votes, was one of sympathy ... with the ‘Lenin circle’. 
” “The Fourth Congress of the Lettish Marxists is an attempt to revert to the old ... Bolshevik ideology. 
” “The resolution on the Duma group was adopted unanimously. 
 It was a big concession on the part of the minority of the Congress [that is, a concession to the “Leninists”]. 
” “The Lenin circle can count on the official support of the Letts”, and so on. 
 The writer makes the reservation that “the minority succeeded somewhat in marring Lenin’s triumph”. 
 He calls (and rightly so!) “curious” the concessions made by themajority to the conciliators. 
 But he clearly and unequivocally recognises the fact that the Congress took an anti-liquidationist stand, and, onthe main issue, took sides with the Pravdists. 
 It is the same old story. 
 For two or three months the liquidators raise a hullabaloo, only to admit afterwardsthat it was we who correctly presented the facts in thefirst instance. 
 To what lengths the liquidators sometimes go in their striving to “explain” unpalatable Party decisions can be seen from the following. 
 In December 1908, as is known, the all-Russia conference of Marxists rejected the proposal to amalgamate with Jagiello’s party (the P. 
S. 
P. 
). 
 Thiswas done in the most emphatic form—by proceeding withthe agenda without debating the motion for amalgamationwith the non-Social-Democratic party of deputy Jagiello. 
 At their Congress in 1914, the Letts endorsed all the deci-sions adopted in 1908, thereby declaring their refusal tohave the non-Social-Democrat Jagiello admitted to the So-cial-Democratic group. 
 This decision is most unpalatableto the liquidators. 
 And yet in Zeit , the newspaper of the Jewish liquidators, we find this decision “explained” in the following manner: “What does proceeding with the agenda mean? It means that the meeting does not want to put the motion to the vote, does not want either to reject or adopt it. 
 In such cases it calls the next business. 
 The question of amalgamation with the Jagiello trend was simplyleft open [!] at the meeting of 1908. 
” ( Zeit No. 
 17. 
) Is not such an “explanation” of Party decisions sheer ... impudence? When the liquidators’ proposal for amalgamation with the Jagiello trend was rejected, F. 
 Dan wrote at the time(in 1908) in his official press report: “At the proposal of the Polish delegation [the Polish Social-Demo-crats] the conference refused even to discuss our resolution and passedon to the next business. 
 In this minor fact, circle intolerance and circle habits of thought have apparently reached their uttermost limit. 
” (F. 
 Dan’s Report, p. 
 45. 
) F. 
 Dan used this strong language because he knew that proceeding with the agenda meant a flat rejection of the proposal for amalgamation with Jagiello’s non-Social-Democratic party. 
 And now this flat rejection is “explained”to us as meaning that the question has been “left open”, andthat everyone is free to decide it in his own way! This isreally the last straw in the flouting of Marxist decisions. 
 No amount of wriggling will help the liquidators. 
 The Marxist line has been endorsed by life itself. 
 Events in the Lettish Social-Democratic movement confirm this noless strikingly than the entire course of the working-classmovement throughout Russia does. 
 Rabochy No. 
 7, Published according to June 9, 1914 the text in Rabochy THE WORKING CLASS AND ITS PRESS There is nothing more important to class-conscious workers than to have an understanding of the significance of their movement and a thorough knowledge of it. 
 The only source of strength of the working-class movement—and aninvincible one at that—is the class-consciousness of the workers and the broad scope of their struggle, that is, the participation in it of the masses of the wage-workers. 
 The St. 
 Petersburg Marxist press, which has been in existence for years, publishes exclusive, excellent, indis-pensable and easily verifiable material on the scope of theworking-class movement and the various trends predominat-ing in it. 
 Only those who wish to conceal the truth can ignore this material, as the liberals and liquidators do.

 Of course, there are groups which made several collections, but separate data for these are not available. 
 We see that only one-fifth of the total number of work-ers’ groups are in sympathy with the liquidators. 
 In two-and-a-half years, Pravdism, Pravdist decisions and Prav-dist tactics have united four-fifths of Russia’s class-conscious workers. 
 This fact of workers’ unity can well bear compari-son with the phrases about “unity” uttered by the various grouplets of intellectuals, the Vperyodists, Plekhanovites,Trotskyists, etc. 
, etc. 
 Let us compare the figures for 1913 and 1914 (those for 1912 are not comparable, because Pravda appeared in April, and Luch five months later). 
 We shall find that the number of Pravdist groups has grown by 692, i. 
e. 
, 31. 
7 per cent , whereas the liquidationist groups have gone up by 10,i. 
e. 
, 1. 
5 per cent . 
 Hence, the workers’ readiness to support the Pravdist newspapers has grown 20 times as fast as their readiness to support the liquidationist newspapers. 
 Let us see how the workers in various parts of Russia are divided according to trend: Per cent of total workers’ groups Pravdist Liquidationist St. 
 Petersburg .... 
. 
 86 14 Moscow ....... 
. 
 83 17 Provinces ....... 
 68 32 The inference is clear: the more politically developed the masses of the workers are, and the higher their level ofclass-consciousness and political activity, the higher is the number of Pravdists among them. 
 In St. 
 Petersburg the liquidators have been almost completely dislodged (four-teen out of a hundred); they still have a precarious hold inthe provinces (32 out of 100), where the masses are politi-cally less educated. 
 It is highly instructive to note that figures from an entirely different source, namely, those giving the number of work-ers’ delegates elected during the Insurance Board elections, tally to a remarkable degree with those of the workers’groups. 
 During the election of the Metropolitan InsuranceBoard, 37 Pravdist and 7 liquidationist delegates were elected, i. 
e. 
, 84 per cent and 16 per cent respectively. 
 Of the total number of delegates elected, the Pravdists con-stituted 70 per cent (37 out of 53), and at the election of the All-Russia Insurance Board they obtained 47 out of 57, i. 
e. 
, 82 per cent. 
 The liquidators, non-party people andNarodniks form a small minority of workers, who stillremain under bourgeois influence. 
 To proceed. 
 The following are interesting figures on the average amounts collected by workers’ groups: Average amounts collected by work-ers’ groups Pravdist Liquidationist (rubles) (rubles) St.

89 The Pravdist groups show a natural, understandable and, so to speak, normal tendency: the average contribution from the average workers’ group rises with the increase in the average earnings of the working masses. 
 In the case of the liquidators, we see, apart from the spurt in the Moscow groups (of which there are only 25in all!), that the average contributions from the pro-vincial groups are higher than those from the St. 
 Peters-burg groups! How are we to explain this odd phenomenon? Only a more detailed analysis of the figures could pro-vide a satisfactory reply to this question, but that would bea laborious task. 
 Our conjecture is that the liquidatorsunite the minority of the higher-paid workers in certainsections of industry. 
 It has been observed all over the world that such workers cling to liberal and opportunist ideas. 
 In St. 
 Petersburg, the longest to put up with the liqui-dators were the printing workers, and it was only duringthe last elections in their Union, on April 27, 1914, thatthe Pravdists won half the seats on the Executive and amajority of the seats for alternate members. 
 In all coun-tries the printers are most inclined towards opportunism, and some grades among them are highly paid workers. 
 If our conclusion about the minority of the workers, the labour aristocracy, being in sympathy with the liquidators is merely conjectural, there can be no doubt whatever where individuals are concerned. 
 Of the contributions made by non-workers, more than half came from individuals (531 out of 713 in our case, 266 out of 453 in the case of the liqui-dators). 
 The average contribution from this source inour case is R. 
1. 
97 whereas among the liquidators it isR. 
 6. 
05! In the first case, the contributions obviously came from lower-paid office workers, civil servants, etc. 
, and from the petty-bourgeois elements of a semi-proletarian character. 
In the case of the liquidators, however, we see that theyhave rich friends among the bourgeoisie. 
 These rich friends from among the bourgeoisie take still more definite shape as “groups of adherents, friends, etc. 
” These groups collected R. 
458. 
82 for us, i. 
e. 
, two per cent of the total sum collected, the average donation pergroup being R. 
10. 
92, which is only half as much againas the average donation of workers’ groups. 
 For the liqui-dators, however, these groups collected R. 
2,450. 
60, i. 
e. 
,over 20 per cent of the total sum collected, the average donation per group being R. 
 45. 
39 , i. 
e. 
, six times the average collected by workers’ groups! To this we add the collections made abroad, where bour-geois students are the main contributors. 
 We receivedR. 
49. 
79 from this source, i. 
e. 
, less than one-fourth of oneper cent; the liquidators received R. 
1,709. 
17, i. 
e. 
, 14 per cent . 
 If we add up individuals, “adherents and friends”, and collections made abroad, the total amount collected fromthese sources will be as follows: Pravdists—R. 
 1,555. 
23, i. 
e. 
, 7 per cent of the total collections. 
 Liquidators—R. 
 5,768. 
09, i. 
e. 
, 48 per cent of the total collections. 
 From this source we received less than one-tenth of what we received from the workers’ groups (R. 
 18,934). 
 Thissource gave the liquidators more than they received from the workers’ groups (R. 
5,296)! The inference is clear: the liquidationist newspaper is not a workers’ but a bourgeois newspaper. 
 It is run mainly on funds contributed by rich friends from among the bourgeoisie . 
 As a matter of fact, the liquidators are far more dependent upon the bourgeoisie than our figures show. 
 The Pravdist newspapers have frequently published their financial re-ports for public information. 
 These reports have shown thatour newspaper, by adding collections to its income, is pay-ing its way. 
 With a circulation of 40,000 (the average forMay 1914), this is understandable, in spite of confiscationsand a dearth of advertisements. 
 The liquidators, however, published their report only once (Luch No. 
 101), showing a deficit of 4,000 rubles. 
 After this, they adopted the usualbourgeois custom of not publishing reports. 
 With a cir-culation of 15,000, their newspaper cannot avoid a deficit,and evidently this is covered again and again by their richfriends from among the bourgeoisie. 
 Liberal-labour politicians like to drop hints about an “ open workers’ party”, but they do not like to reveal to genuine workers their actual dependence upon the bourgeoisie!It is left for us, “underground” workers, to teach the liquida-tor-liberals the benefit of open reports.... 
 The overall ratio of worker and non-worker collections is as follows: Collected by Out of every ruble collected for Pravdist liquidationist newspapers newspapers Workers ....

00 ruble 1. 
00 ruble The Pravdists get one-seventh of their aid collections from the bourgeoisie and, as we have seen, from its mostdemocratic and least wealthy sections. 
 The liquidationistundertaking is largely a bourgeois undertaking, which is supported only by a minority of the workers. 
 The figures concerning the sources of funds also reveal to us the class status of the readers and buyers of the news-papers. 
 Voluntary contributions are made only by regular readers, who most intelligently sympathise with the trend of the given newspaper. 
 In its turn, the trend of the given news-paper willy-nilly “adapts itself” to the more “influential”section of its reading public. 
 The deductions that follow from our figures are, first, theoretical, i. 
e. 
, such as will help the working class to understand the conditions of its movement, and secondly, practical deductions, which will give us direct guidancein our activities. 
 It is sometimes said that there is not one working-class press in Russia, but two. 
 Even Plekhanov repeated thisstatement not long ago. 
 But that is not true. 
 Those who say this betray sheer ignorance, if not a secret desire to help the liquidators spread bourgeois influence among the work-ers. 
 Long ago and repeatedly (for example, in 1908 and 1910),the Party decisions clearly, definitely, and directly pointedto the bourgeois nature of liquidationism. 
 Articles in theMarxist press have explained this truth hundreds of times. 
 The experience of a daily newspaper, which openly ap-peals to the masses, was bound to disclose the real class character of the liquidationist trend . 
 And that is what it did. 
 The liquidationist newspaper has indeed proved to bea bourgeois undertaking, which is supported by a minorityof the workers. 
 Moreover, let us not forget that almost up to the spring of 1914 the liquidationist newspaper was the mouthpieceof the August bloc. 
 It was only lately that the Letts with-drew from it, and Trotsky, Em-El, An, Buryanov andYegorov have left, or are leaving, the liquidators. 
 Thebreak-up of the bloc is continuing. 
 The near future is bound to reveal still more clearly the bourgeois character of the liquidationist trend and the sterility of the intellectualist grouplets , such as the Vperyodists, Plekhanovites, Tro-tskyists, etc. 
 The practical deductions may be summed up in the fol-lowing points: 1) 5,674 workers’ groups united by the Pravdists in less than two-and-a-half years is a fairly large number,considering the harsh conditions obtaining in Russia. 
But this is only a beginning. 
 We need, not thousands, buttens of thousands of workers’ groups. 
 We must intensify ouractivities tenfold. 
 Ten rubles collected in kopeks from hun-dreds of workers are more important and valuable, both from the ideological and organisational point of view, than ahundred rubles from rich friends among the bourgeoisie. 
 Even from the financial aspect, experience goes to prove that it is possible to run a well-established workers’ newspa-per with the aid of workers’ kopeks, but impossible to do so with the aid of bourgeois rubles. 
 The liquidationist under-taking is a bubble, which is bound to burst. 
 2) We lag behind in the provinces, where 32 per cent of the workers’ groups support the liquidators! Every class-conscious worker must exert every effort to put an end to this lamentable and disgraceful state of affairs. 
 We must bring all our weight to bear in the provinces. 
 3) The rural workers are apparently still almost un-touched by the movement. 
 Difficult as work in this field maybe, we must press forward with it in the most vigorousmanner. 
 4) Like a mother who carefully tends a sick child and gives it better nourishment, the class-conscious workersmust take more care of the districts and factories wherethe workers are sick with liquidationism. 
 This malady,which emanates from the bourgeoisie, is inevitable in ayoung working-class movement, but with proper care and persistent treatment, it will pass without any serious after-effects. 
 To provide the sick workers with more plentifulnourishment in the shape of Marxist literature, to explainmore carefully and in more popular form the history andtactics of the Party and the meaning of the Party decisionson the bourgeois nature of liquidationism, to explain at greater length the urgent necessity of proletarian unity, i. 
e. 
, the submission of the minority of the workers to themajority, the submission of the one-fifth to the four-fifthsof the class-conscious workers of Russia—such are someof the most important tasks confronting us. 
 Trudovaya Pravda Nos. 
 14 and 15, June 13 and 14, 1914 . 
 Symposium Marxism and Liquidationism , Part II. 
 Priboi Publishers, St. 
 Petersburg, 1914 Signed: V. 
 IlyinPublished according to the text of the symposium verified with that of the newspaper Trudovaya Pravda LEFT -WING NARODISM AND ISM Marxists have repeatedly spoken about the importance of the free mobilisation (i. 
e. 
, the buying, selling and mort-gaging) of peasant land. 
 This real and practical problemaffords a striking illustration of the petty-bourgeois and even positively reactionary character of our Narodniks. 
 All Narodniks, from the semi-Cadets of Russkoye Bogatstvo (“Social-Cadets” as Chernov, Vikhlayev and similar peopleonce rightly called them) to the ultra-“Left” Narodniksof Stoikaya Mysl , are opposed to the free mobilisation of peasant land in general, and of allotment land in partic-ular. 
 The Marxists, however, openly state in their Programme that they will “ always and invariably oppose any attempt to check the course of economic progress ”. 
 The economic development of Russia, as of the whole world, proceeds from feudalism to capitalism, and through large-scale, machine, capitalist production to socialism. 
 Pipe-dreaming about a “different” way to socialism other than that which leads through the further develop-ment of capitalism, through large-scale, machine, capitalist production, is, in Russia, characteristic either of the liberalgentlemen, or of the backward, petty proprietors (the petty bourgeoisie). 
 These dreams, which still clog the brains of the Left Narodniks, merely reflect the backwardness (reac-tionary nature) and feebleness of the petty bourgeoisie. 
 Class-conscious workers all over the world, Russia in-cluded, are becoming more and more convinced of the cor-rectness of Marxism, for life itself is proving to them that only large-scale, machine production rouses the workers, enlightens and organises them, and creates the objective conditions for a mass movement. 
 When Put Pravdy reaffirmed the well-known Marxist axiom that capitalism is progressive as compared with feudal-ism,* and that the idea of checking the development of capitalism is a utopia, most absurd, reactionary, and harmfulto the working people, Mr. 
 N. 
 Rakitnikov, the Left Narod-nik (in Smelaya Mysl No. 
 7), accused Put Pravdy of having undertaken the “not very honourable task of putting agloss upon the capitalist noose”. 
 Anyone interested in Marxism and in the experience of the international working-class-movement would do well toponder over this! One rarely meets with such amazing ignor-ance of Marxism as that displayed by Mr. 
 N. 
 Rakitnikovand the Left Narodniks, except perhaps among bourgeoiseconomists. 
 Can it be that Mr. 
 Rakitnikov has not read Capital , or The Poverty of Philosophy , or The Communist Manifesto ? If he has not, then it is pointless to talk about socialism. 
That will be a ridiculous waste of time. 
 If he has read them, then he ought to know that the fun-damental idea running through all Marx’s works, an idea which since Marx has been confirmed in all countries, is that capitalism is progressive as compared with feudalism. 
 It is in this sense that Marx and all Marxists “put a gloss”(to use Rakitnikov’s clumsy and stupid expression) “uponthe capitalist noose”! Only anarchists or petty-bourgeois, who do not under-stand the conditions of historical development, can say: a feudal noose or a capitalist one—it makes no difference,for both are nooses! That means confining oneself to con-demnation , and failing to understand the objective course of economic development. 
 Condemnation means our subjective dissatisfaction. 
 The objective course of feudalism’s evolution into capitalism enables millions of working people—thanks to the growth of cities, railways, large factories and the migration ofworkers—to escape from a condition of feudal torpor. 
 Cap-italism itself rouses and organises them. 
 Both feudalism and capitalism oppress the workers and strive to keep them in ignorance. 
 But feudalism can keep, *See pp. 
 298-301 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 and for centuries has kept, millions of peasants in a down-trodden state (for example, in Russia from the ninth to the nineteenth century, in China for even more centuries). 
 But capitalism cannot keep the workers in a state of immo-bility, torpor, downtroddenness and ignorance. 
 The centuries of feudalism were centuries of torpor for the working people. 
 The decades of capitalism have roused millions of wage-workers. 
 Your failure to understand this, gentlemen of the Left-Narodnik fraternity, shows that you do not understand athing about socialism, or that you are converting social-ism from a struggle of millions engendered by objectiveconditions into a benevolent old gentleman’s fairy-tale! To advocate the slightest restriction of the freedom to mobilise allotment land actually amounts to becoming a reactionary, an abettor of the feudalists. 
 Restriction of the freedom to mobilise allotment land retards economic development, hinders the formation, growth, awakening and organisation of the wage-worker class, worsens the conditions of the workers and peasants, and increases the influence of the feudalists. 
 The Peshekhonovs and Rakitnikovs are in fact abettors of precisely these “categories”, when they advocate restric-tion of the freedom to mobilise peasant land. 
 Trudovaya Pravda No. 
 19, Published according to June 19, 1914 the text in Trudovaya Pravda THE AGRARIAN QUESTION IN RUSSIA The agrarian question in Russia is of tremendous impor-tance at the present time. 
 It is common knowledge thatthis question has been given front-rank prominence, notonly by the broad masses of the people, but also by the government. 
 Historically, the movement of 1905 was characterised precisely by the fact that the vast majority of the popula-tion in Russia, namely, the peasantry, made the agrarianquestion a key issue. 
 Both the liberal-bourgeois party andthe workers’ party took this fact into consideration in their respective programmes. 
 On the other hand, when the gov-ernment, in its June Third regime, brought about an al-liance between the landlords and the upper stratum of thebourgeoisie, it made the agrarian question the pivot ofits policy (the forcible destruction of communal landown-ership and the conversion of allotment land into private property, mainly in the homestead system). 
 What is the economic essence of the agrarian question in Russia? It is the reorganisation of Russia on bourgeois-democratic lines. 
 Russia has become a capitalist, bour-geois country, but the system of landownership in thiscountry has to a very large degree remained feudal, as re-gards both landlordism and peasant allotment ownership. 
 In very many cases the system of land economy has remainedfeudal: labour service and the corvée, under which the semi-ruined, pauperised, and starving petty proprietors rentland, grassland and pastures and borrow money from thelandlords; with the obligation to repay the debt by working on the “squire’s” land. 
 The more feudalist rural Rus lags behind industrial, commercial, capitalist Russia, the more complete will be /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR the inevitable break-up of the ancient, feudalist system of landownership, both landlordism and allotment owner-ship. 
 The landlords tried to effect this break-up in the land-lord fashion, to suit the interests of the landlords, retainingtheir own landed estates, and helping the kulaks to grabthe peasants’ land. 
 The majority of the peasants triedto do this in peasant fashion, to suit the interests of the peasants. 
 In either case the reform remains bourgeois in character . 
 In his Poverty of Philosophy , in Capital , and in Theories of Surplus-Value , Marx amply proved that the bourgeois economists often demanded the nationalisation of the land, i. 
e. 
, the conversion of all land into public property, and that this measure was a fully bourgeois measure. 
 Capitalism will develop more widely, more freely and more quicklyfrom such a measure. 
 This measure is very progressive andvery democratic. 
 It will do away completely with serfdom,will break the monopoly in land, and will abolish absolute rent (the existence of which the liquidator P. 
 Maslov, trailing in the wake of bourgeois scholars, erroneously de-nies). 
 It will speed up the development of the productiveforces in agriculture and purge the class movement amongthe wage-workers. 
 But, we repeat, this is a bourgeois-democratic measure. 
 Like Mr. 
 V—dimov in Smelaya Mysl , the Left Narodniks persist in calling the bourgeois nationalisation of the land “socialisation ” and persistently ignore Marx’s comprehensive explanations of what nationalisation of land under capi-talism implies. 
 The Left Narodniks persist in reiterating the purely bourgeois theory of “labour economy” and its development under “socialisation”, whereas, in fact, with the nationali-sation of the land, it is capitalist landownership in its purest form, free of feudalism, that will inevitably devel-op more widely and quickly. 
 The catchword of “socialisation of the land” merely de-notes the Left Narodniks’ utter failure to grasp the princi-ples of Marx’s political economy, and the fact that they are going over (stealthily, by fits and starts, and often uncon-sciously) to the side of bourgeois political economy. 
 Marx advised class-conscious workers, while forming a clear idea of the bourgeois character of all agrarian reforms under capitalism (including the nationalisation of the land), to support bourgeois-democratic reforms as againstthe feudalists and serfdom. 
 But Marxists cannot confusebourgeois measures with socialism. 
 Trudovaya Pravda No. 
 22, Published according to June 22, 1914 the text in Trudovaya Pravda THE POLITICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF VITUPERATION (ON THE QUESTION OF UNITY) Can abusive language have political significance?—the reader will ask. 
 Undoubtedly. 
 Here is an example taken from a field all class-conscious workers are interested in. 
 We, Pravdists, are abused for “usurpers”, people who seize power illegally. 
 In March 1912 , the Plekhanovites, Vperyodists, Trotskyists, the liquidators, and a host ofother groups “united” to abuse us in this way. 
 Now, in June 1914 , after a lapse of two odd years, the supporters of Yedinstvo , the liquidators, Vperyodists, Trots-kyists and probably a dozen other groups, are once more“uniting ” to abuse us. 
 To help the reader grasp the political significance of this vituperation, we ask him to recall certain elementarythings that the supporters of Yedinstvo and Co. 
 are trying to “talk away” with their clamour and abuse. 
 “They” have all declared the Conference of January 1912 to be an act of usurpation, illegal seizure of power. 
 ThatConference, they argue, had no right to call itself the su-preme organ of the entire Marxist body. 
 Splendid, gentlemen! But see how the political facts expose the inanity and falsity of your phrases. 
 Let us assume that you are right, and that the Confer-ence of January 1912 was an “illegal seizure of power”. 
What follows from that? It follows that all the groups, trends and circles, and all the Social-Democrats who resented this “illegal seizure of power”, should have stood up for the “law”. 
 Is that not so? They should have united, not only to vilify the usur-pers, but also to overthrow them . 
 This would seem indisputable, would it not? It would seem that the brave Plekhanov, the courageous Trotsky, the bold Vperyodists and the noble liquidators could not have united to abuse the usurpers without also uniting for the purpose of overthrowing the usurpers . 
 If our heroes had not done that, they would have shown themselves to be mere windbags, would they not? And what had to be done to overthrow the “usurpers”? All that the noble protestants against usurpation had to do was to get together without the usurpers, condemn them, and show the workers a practical example , a fact —a fact and not promises, deeds and not phrases—of what legitimatebodies are like, as distinct from usurpatory ones. 
 Only a person who regards all class-conscious workers in Russia as idiots could fail to agree that what these work-ers would have done, on seeing the united activities ofthe noble protestants against the “usurpers”, would be tosupport these protestants, throw out the usurpers, andtreat them with ridicule and scorn! Clear enough, it would seem? One would think it absolutely indisputable that it was the bounden duty , not only of every Marxist, but of every self-respecting democrat, to unite with all opponents of“usurpation”, with the purpose of overthrowing the usurpers. 
 But actually?What actually happened? What happened two years after our noble opponents of “usurpation ” took the field against the usurpers? What happened was that the “usurpers” united T (four-fifths ) of all the class-conscious workers of Russia around their decisions. 
 For two-and-a-half years, from January 1, 1912, to May 13, 1914, the Pravdist newspapers received financial sup-port from 5,674 workers’ groups, while the noble opponentsof “usurpation”, the liquidators and their friends, receivedthe support of 1,421 workers’ groups. 
 The “usurpers” brought about the unity of four-fifths of the workers of Russia, not merely in word, but in deed. 
 The noble enemies of “usurpation”, however, went up in smoke, for their August bloc collapsed; Trotsky, the Letts, the Caucasian leaders, etc. 
, fell away in separate little groups, which , in the actual movement , proved to be mere cyphers , both individually and collectively. 
 How is this miracle to be explained?How could four-fifths of the workers stand for vile “usur-pation” against the numerous, manifold, noble enemies of usurpation who represented “ a multitude of trends ”? Reader, this could and had to happen for the following reason: in politics abusive language often serves as a screen for utter lack of principles and sterility, impotence, angryimpotence, on the part of those who use such language. 
 That is all there is to it. 
But in spite of all the abuse that is heaped on the Prav-dists, “usurpers”, Leninists, etc. 
, the class-conscious work-ers are uniting, and will continue to unite, around the principles and tactics of consistent Marxism. 
 Despite allthis kind of language, they recognise unity only from below , the unity of the workers based on condemnation of liquida-tionism , on acceptance of all the decisions of the “entire Marxist body”. 
 The-subordination of the minority to the majority, not compromise with intellectualist groups— only this can serve as the principle of the working-classmovement. 
 Trudovaya Pravda No. 
 23, Published according to June 24, 1914 the text in Trudovaya Pravda OBJECTIVE DATA ON THE STRENGTH OF THE VARIOUS TRENDS IN THE WORKIN G-CLAS S MOVEMEN T171 There can be no more important duty for class-conscious workers than that of getting to know their class movement, its nature, its aims and objects, its conditions and practi-cal forms. 
 That is because the strength of the working-class movement lies entirely in its political consciousness,and its mass character. 
 At each step in its development, capitalism increases the number of proletarians, wage-workers; it rallies, organises and enlightens them, and in this way moulds a class force that must inevitably marchtowards its goal. 
 The Marxists’ programme and their decisions on tactics, as constantly expounded in the press, help the masses ofthe workers to understand the nature, aims and objects of the movement. 
 The struggle between the various trends in the working-class movement of Russia has deep class roots. 
 The two “trends” which are fighting Marxism (Pravdism) in theworking-class movement of Russia and which, because oftheir mass form and their roots in history, deserve to be called “trends”, i. 
e. 
, Narodism and liquidationism, express the bourgeoisie’s influence on the proletariat. 
 This has beenexplained many times by the Marxists and acknowledgedin a number of decisions adopted by them in regard to theNarodniks (the fight against whom has been going on forthirty years) and in regard to the liquidators (the history of liquidationism goes back about twenty years, for liqui-dationism is the direct continuation of Economism andMenshevism). 
 More objective data on the strength of the different trends in Russia’s working-class movement are now stead-ily accumulating. 
 Every effort must be made to col-lect, verify and study these objective data concerningthe behaviour and moods, not of individuals or groups,but of the masses , data taken from different and hostile newspapers, data that are verifiable by any literate person. 
 Only from such data can one learn and study the move-ment of one’s class. 
 One of the greatest, if not the greatest,faults (or crimes against the working class) of the Narod-niks and liquidators, as well as of the various groups ofintellectuals such as the Vperyodists, Plekhanovites andTrotskyists, is their subjectivism . 
 At every step they try to pass off their desires, their “views”, their appraisals of the situation and their “plans”, as the will of the workers,the needs of the working-class movement. 
 When they talkabout “unity”, for example, they majestically ignore theexperience acquired in creating the genuine unity of the majority of Russia’s class-conscious workers in the course of two-and-a-half years, from the beginning of 1912 to the middle of 1914. 
 Let us then tabulate the available objective data on the strength of the various trends in the working-classmovement. 
 Those who believe in subjective appraisalsand promises are free to go to the “groups”. 
 We invite only those who desire to study objective figures.

. 
 14@* 3@* —— 2 First of all we shall briefly explain the above figures and then draw the conclusions that follow from them. 
 It will be best to make the explanations point by point. 
 Point 1. 
 Figures showing the number of electors and delegates elected are not available . 
 To complain about our using “curia” figures is simply ridiculous, for no other are available. 
 The German Social-Democrats measure their successes under the Bismarck electoral law, which excludeswomen and thereby creates a “male” curia! Point 2. 
 The number of workers’ groups which pay and not only “sign resolutions” is the most reliable and truecriterion, not only of the strength of the trend, but also of its state of organisation and its Party spirit. 
 That is why the liquidators and the “groups” betray such subjective dislike for this criterion. 
 The liquidators argued: We have also a Yiddish and a Georgian newspapers, but the Pravda stands alone. 
 That is not true. 
 Firstly, the Estonian and Lithuanian newspapersare Pravdist. 
 172 Secondly, if we take the provinces, is it permissible to forget Moscow? During 1913 the Moscow work-ers’ newspaper173 rallied, united 390 workers’ groups ( Ra-bochy No. 
 1, p. 
 19), whereas the Yiddish newspaper Zeit , from issue No. 
 2 (December 29, 1912) to June 1, 1914, unit-ed 296 workers’ groups (of these 190 were united up to *In one union the Pravdists and liquidators had an equal num-ber of supporters. 
 March 20, 1914, and 106 from March 20 to June 1, 1914). 
 Thus, Moscow alone amply “covered” the liquidators’ sub-jective reference to Zeit ! We invite the Georgian and Armenian comrades to collect data on the liquidators’ newspapers in the Caucasus. 
 Howmany workers’ groups are there? Objective data coveringall aspects are needed. 
 Mistakes in counting the groups may have been made, but only in individual cases. 
 We invite everybody to verify the figures and correct them. 
 Points 3 and 4 require no explanation. 
 It would be de-sirable to initiate an enquiry for the purpose of collectingnew data from the provinces. 
 Point 5. 
 The 2,985 liquidator signatures include 1,086 Bundist and 719 Caucasian signatures. 
 It is desirable that the local comrades verify these figures. 
 Point 6. 
 The treasurers of the two groups publish reports of all funds each group receives for various objects. 
 These figures serve as an exact and objective index of contactswith the workers. 
 Point 7. 
 Circulation of newspapers. 
 The figures were collected and published by E. 
 Vandervelde but hushed upby the liquidators and the liberals ( Kievskaya Mysl ). 
 “Sub-jectivism. 
” It is desirable that fuller figures be collected,if only for one month. 
 Points 8 and 9. 
 Here we have an objective illustration of the liquidators’ renunciation of the “underground”, i. 
e. 
, of the Party. 
 But from January 1 to May 13, 1914, receiptsfrom abroad gave the Pravdists R. 
49. 
79 (one-fourth of oneper cent) and the liquidators R. 
1,709. 
17 (fourteen per cent). 
Don’t say, “I can’t”; say, “I don’t want to”! Points 10 to 14. 
 These are objective evidence of the de-pendence of the liquidators and Narodniks on the bour-geoisie, evidence of their bourgeois character. 
 Subjectively , the liquidators and Narodniks are “socialists” and “Social-Democrats”. 
 Objectively , both as regards the substance of their ideas as well as the experience of the mass movement, they are groups of bourgeois intellectuals, which are split-ting the minority of workers away from the workers’ party. 
 We especially draw our readers’ attention to the way in which the liquidators fake workers’ correspondence. 
 This is an unprecedented and downright fraud! Let all Marxists in the localities expose this fraud and collect objective data (see Trudovaya Pravda No. 
 12, June 11, 191 4174). 
 Point 15. 
 These figures are particularly important and ought to be supplemented and verified by means of a sep-arate enquiry. 
 We have taken the figures from Sputnik Rabochego , Priboi Publishers, St. 
 Petersburg, 1914. 
175 Among the unions included in the liquidators’ list were the Clerks’ Union, the Draftsmen’s Union, and the Druggist Employees’ Union (at the last election of the Executive of the Printers’Union on April 27, 1914, half the members of the Execu-tive and more than half of the alternate members electedwere Pravdists). 
 The Narodnik list of unions includes theBakers’ Union and the Case-Makers’ Union. 
 Aggregate membership about 22,000. 
 Of the thirteen unions in Moscow, ten are Pravdist and three indefinite, although they are closer to the Pravdists. 
 There is not a single liquidationist or Narodnik union inMoscow. 
 The conclusions to be drawn from these objective data are that Pravdism is the only Marxist, proletarian trend,really independent of the bourgeoisie, and has organisedand united over four-fifths of the workers (in 1914, 81. 
1 per cent of the workers’ groups as compared with the liqui-dators). 
 Liquidationism and Narodism are undoubtedlybourgeois-democratic, not working-class trends. 
 The correctness of the Pravdists’ programmatic, tactical and organisational ideas, their decisions and line has beenwholly and splendidly confirmed by the experience ofthe mass movement in 1912, 1913 and half of 1914. 
 From ourconviction that we are on the right road we should drawthe strength for still greater efforts. 
 Trudovaya Pravda No. 
 25, Published according to June 26, 1914 the text in Trudovaya Pravda HOW STRONG IS THE LEFT-NARODNIK TREND AMONG THE WORKERS Throughout the world a section of the workers, as is well known, still follows the lead of various bourgeoisparties. 
 During the period of bourgeois-democratic reform in Russia, a minority of the class-conscious workers still follows the lead of the bourgeois group of liquidation-ist writers, and of the bourgeois-democratic Narodniktrend. 
 It has been reiterated many times in precise, clearly for-mulated and official decisions of the Marxists (1903, 1907 and 1913) 176 that the entire Narodnik trend, including the Left Narodniks, is a bourgeois (peasant) democracy inRussia. 
 That some of the workers should follow the leadof the Left Narodniks, who describe radical peasant (but in substance downright bourgeois ) demands as “socialism”, is quite natural in a capitalist country during an intense movement against survivals of serfdom. 
 But exactly which section of the class-conscious workers follows the lead of the Left Narodniks? Sovremennik , one of the most unprincipled intellectualist journals, which (on the basis of false phrases) “unites”the Left Narodniks, Plekhanov, and Mr. 
 Potresov and Co. 
, recently stated that “about” one-third of the workers follow the lead of the Left Narodniks. 
 This is a barefaced, deliberate lie, like those commonly uttered by the liquidators. 
 As far as we know, only three sets of objective data show-ing the degree of influence the Left Narodniks exercise among the workers are available. 
 These are, firstly, the circulation figures of the newspapers. 
 Secondly, the figures showingthe number of workers’ groups which have collected funds. 
 Thirdly, the figures showing the number of delegates elected to the Metropolitan Insurance Board. 
 We shall compare these data, which differ from the bare-faced lies of Martov, Himmer and Co. 
 in that anybody can find them in open and public sources appertaining tothe different parties, and verify them.

3 The circulation figures are the most “favourable” to the bourgeois groups (the liquidators and Left Narodniks). 
But the liquidator and Left-Narodnik newspapers arebourgeois newspapers, not working-class! This is proved by the figures of the funds collected (from January 1 to May 13,1914). 
 The liquidators’ reports show that 56 per cent of their total collections came from non-workers ( Trudovaya Pravda No. 
 15). 
 * In the case of the Left Narodniks, 50 per cent of their collections came from this source. 
 More-over, as far as is known, the Left Narodniks have neverpublished the financial reports of their newspaper, which,like that of the liquidators, is evidently maintained by rich friends from among the bourgeoisie . 
 *See pp. 
 363-71 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 The Pravdist newspaper is the only working-class news-paper. 
 Both the liquidationist and the Left-Narodnik news-papers are bourgeois newspapers . 
 No lie can refute this objective fact . 
 The figures of the workers’ groups approach most closely and exactly to European party membership figures. 
 The number of Left-Narodnik groups is growing very rap-idly (it has doubled in the course of the year) and now constitutes 12. 
8 per cent of the total groups of all the newspa-pers. 
 Their number is growing at the expense of the liqui-dators , for the number of the latter’s groups is almost at a standstill (an increase of only ten groups in the first halfof 1914 at a time when the working-class movement showedan enormous growth) and their percentage is diminishing : from 21. 
3 per cent to 16. 
6 per cent. 
 By their opportunism and renunciation of the Party, the liquidators are pushing their working-class support-ers towards the other , more “radical” (in word) bourgeois group. 
 Between 1913 and 1914, the Pravdists obtained 692 new groups, the liquidators 10, and the Left Narodniks 260. 
 In percentages the increases are: Pravdists plus 31. 
7, liquida-tors plus 1. 
5, Left Narodniks plus 100 (small figures alwaysincrease faster than big ones; for example, if Plekhanovhas nine workers’ groups and, by the time of Vienna—andfor Vienna 177—there will be 27 or 45, the percentage increase will be plus 200, or plus 400). 
 The Insurance Board election figures apply only to St. 
 Petersburg. 
 It should be said that in 1914 the Left Narod-niks in St. 
 Petersburg are ahead of the liquidators as far as collection by workers’ groups is concerned. 
 Thus, between January 1 and May 13, 1914, the Pravdists in St. 
 Petersburg received contributions from 2,024 work-ers’ groups, the liquidators from 308 and the Left Na-rodniks from 391 groups. 
 The percentages are: Pravdists 74. 
3, liquidators 11. 
4, Left Narodniks 14. 
3. 
 Like the true opportunists they are, our liquidators reacted to this increase in strength of the Left Narodniks, not by intensifying their struggle for the principles of Marxism, but by entering into a bloc with the Left Narod-niks against the Marxists (Pravdists)! The Left Narodniks, in Sovremennik , openly advocate such an alliance on behalf of all their leaders; but the liquidators lack the courage to explain their conduct to the workers openly and straightforwardly. 
 They do it in anunderhand way. 
 They are genuine Cadets. 
 For example. 
 Recently, the Left-Narodnik newspaper (Zhivaya Mysl Truda No. 
 3, June 15, 1914) published an article entitled “The Insurance Delegates Elections at the Aivaz Works”. 
 In this article we read: ... “Of necessity, the Aivaz workers will be offered a choice of two lists:one, a joint Menshevik and Left-Narodnik list ... the other a Pravdist list.... 
” (Our italics. 
) Alliance with the liquidators is interpreted in this article by the Left Narodniks as the principle of co-operation among all “ socialist ” trends, i. 
e. 
, the liquidators are al-leged to have renounced not only the resolution of 1907,which defined the Left Narodniks as a bourgeois trend,but also the resolution of 1903 proposed by Axelrod. 
 Marxists regard the increase in the Left Narodniks’ strength as a symptom, or presage, of a revival among the peasantry which, of course, is enough to “turn the heads” of non-class-conscious proletarians and petty-bourgeoisintellectuals. 
 As far as we Marxists are concerned, thisfact will only stimulate our efforts in advocating Marxismas against petty-bourgeois Narodism. 
 Fellow-workers! Put less faith in promises and fairy-tales! Study more closely the objective data on your own working-class movement and on how the bourgeois ideas andthe bourgeois practices of the liquidators and Left Narod-niks influence a minority of the workers.

 Ilyin Clause 9 of the Russian Marxists’ Programme, which deals with the right of nations to self-determination, has (as we have already pointed out in Prosveshcheniye )* given rise lately to a crusade on the part of the opportunists. 
 TheRussian liquidator Semkovsky, in the St. 
 Petersburg liqui-dationist newspaper, and the Bundist Liebman and the Uk-rainian nationalist-socialist Yurkevich in their respective periodicals have violently attacked this clause and treated it with supreme contempt. 
 There is no doubt that this cam-paign of a motley array of opportunists against our MarxistProgramme is closely connected with present-day national-ist vacillations in general. 
 Hence we consider a detailedexamination of this question timely. 
 We would mention, in passing, that none of the opportunists named above has offered a single argument of his own; they all merely repeatwhat Rosa Luxemburg said in her lengthy Polish articleof 1908-09, “The National Question and Autonomy”. 
 Inour exposition we shall deal mainly with the “original”arguments of this last-named author. 
 1. 
 WHAT IS MEANT BY THE SELF-DETERMINATION OF NATIONS? Naturally, this is the first question that arises when any attempt is made at a Marxist examination of what is known as self-determination. 
 What should be understood by that term? Should the answer be sought in legal definitionsdeduced from all sorts of “general concepts” of law? Oris it rather to be sought in a historico-economic study of thenational movements? It is not surprising that the Semkovskys, Liebmans and Yurkeviches did not even think of raising this question, *See pp. 
 17-51 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 and shrugged it off by scoffing at the “obscurity” of the Marxist Programme, apparently unaware, in their simplic-ity, that the self-determination of nations is dealt with, not only in the Russian Programme of 1903, but in theresolution of the London International Congress of 1896(with which I shall deal in detail in the proper place). 
Far more surprising is the fact that Rosa Luxemburg,who declaims a great deal about the supposedly abstract and metaphysical nature of the clause in question, should herself succumb to the sin of abstraction and metaphysics. 
It is Rosa Luxemburg herself who is continually lapsinginto generalities about self-determination (to the extenteven of philosophising amusingly on the question of howthe will of the nation is to be ascertained), without any-where clearly and precisely asking herself whether the gist of the matter lies in legal definitions or in the experienceof the national movements throughout the world. 
 A precise formulation of this question, which no Marx-ist can avoid, would at once destroy nine-tenths of RosaLuxemburg’s arguments. 
 This is not the first time that national movements have arisen in Russia, nor are they peculiar to that country alone. 
 Throughout the world, theperiod of the final victory of capitalism over feudalism hasbeen linked up with national movements. 
 For the completevictory of commodity production, the bourgeoisie mustcapture the home market, and there must be politically united territories whose population speak a single language, with all obstacles to the development of that language and to itsconsolidation in literature eliminated. 
 Therein is the economicfoundation of national movements. 
 Language is the mostimportant means of human intercourse. 
 Unity and unim-peded development of language are the most important conditions for genuinely free and extensive commerce on a scale commensurate with modern capitalism, for a freeand broad grouping of the population in all its variousclasses and, lastly, for the establishment of a close connec-tion between the market and each and every proprietor, bigor little, and between seller and buyer. 
 Therefore, the tendency of every national movement is towards the formation of national states , under which these requirements of modern capitalism are best satisfied. 
 The most profound economic factors drive towards this goal, and, therefore, for the whole of Western Europe, nay, for the entire civilised world, the national state is typical and normal for the capitalist period. 
 Consequently, if we want to grasp the meaning of self-determination of nations, not by juggling with legal defi-nitions, or “inventing” abstract definitions, but by examin-ing the historico-economic conditions of the national move-ments, we must inevitably reach the conclusion that the self-determination of nations means the political separa-tion of these nations from alien national bodies, and theformation of an independent national state. 
 Later on we shall see still other reasons why it would be wrong to interpret the right to self-determination as meaning anything but the right to existence as a separate state. 
 At present, we must deal with Rosa Luxemburg’sefforts to “dismiss” the inescapable conclusion that profoundeconomic factors underlie the urge-towards a national state. 
 Rosa Luxemburg is quite familiar with Kautsky’s pam-phlet Nationality and Internationality . 
 (Supplement to Die Neue Zeit 178 No. 
 1, 1907-08; Russian translation in the journal Nauchnaya Mysl ,179 Riga, 1908. 
) She is aware that, after carefully analysing the question of the national statein §4 of that pamphlet, Kautsky arrived at the conclusionthat Otto Bauer “ underestimates the strength of the urge towards a national state” (p. 
 23 of the pamphlet). 
 Rosa Luxemburg herself quotes the following words of Kautsky’s: “The national state is the form most suited to present-day conditions, [i. 
e. 
, capitalist, civilised, economically pro-gressive conditions, as distinguished from medieval, pre-capitalist, etc. 
]; it is the form in which the state can bestfulfil its tasks” (i. 
e. 
, the tasks of securing the freest, widest and speediest development of capitalism). 
 To this we must add Kautsky’s still more precise concluding remark thatstates of mixed national composition (known as multi-national states, as distinct from national states) are “alwaysthose whose internal constitution has for some reason orother remained abnormal or underdeveloped” (backward). 
 Needless to say, Kautsky speaks of abnormality exclusively in the sense of lack of conformity with what is best adaptedto the requirements of a developing capitalism. 
 The question now is: How did Rosa Luxemburg treat these historico-economic conclusions of Kautsky’s? Are they right or wrong? Is Kautsky right in his historico-economic theory, or is Bauer, whose theory is basically psycholog-ical? What is the connection between Bauer’s undoubted“national opportunism”, his defence of cultural-nationalautonomy, his nationalistic infatuation (“an occasionalemphasis on the national aspect”, as Kautsky put it), his “enormous exaggeration of the national aspect and complete neglect of the international aspect” (Kautsky)—and hisunderestimation of the strength of the urge to create anational state? Rosa Luxemburg has not even raised this question. 
 She has not noticed the connection. 
 She has not considered the sum total of Bauer’s theoretical views. 
 She has not even drawn a line between the historico-economic and the psy-chological theories of the national question. 
 She confinesherself to the following remarks in criticism of Kautsky: “This ‘best’ national state is only an abstraction, which can easily be developed and defended theoretically, but which does not corre-spond to reality. 
” ( Przegl Zd Socjaldemokratyczny , 1908, No. 
 6, p. 
 499. 
) And in corroboration of this emphatic statement there follow arguments to the effect that the “right to self-deter-mination” of small nations is made illusory by the de-velopment of the great capitalist powers and by imperial-ism. 
 “Can one seriously speak,” Rosa Luxemburg exclaims,“about the ‘self-determination ’ of the formally independent Montenegrins, Bulgarians, Rumanians, Serbs, Greeks, partly even the Swiss, whose independence is itself a result of thepolitical struggle and the diplomatic game of the ‘concertof Europe’?! ” (P. 
 500. 
) The state that best suits these con-ditions is “not a national state, as Kautsky believes, buta predatory one”. 
 Some dozens of figures are quoted relating to the size of British, French and other colonial possessions. 
 After reading such arguments, one cannot help marvel-ling at the author’s ability to misunderstand the how and the why of things . 
 To teach Kautsky, with a serious mien, that small states are economically dependent on big ones,that a struggle is raging among the bourgeois states for the predatory suppression of other nations, and that imperialism and colonies exist—all this is a ridiculous and puerile attempt to be clever, for none of this has the slightest bear-ing on the subject. 
 Not only small states, but even Russia, for example, is entirely dependent, economically, on thepower of the imperialist finance capital of the “rich” bour-geois countries. 
 Not only the miniature Balkan states,but even nineteenth-century America was, economically,a colony of Europe, as Marx pointed out in Capital . 
 180 Kautsky, like any Marxist, is, of course, well aware of this, but that has nothing whatever to do with the questionof national movements and the national state. 
 For the question of the political self-determination of nations and their independence as states in bourgeois so-ciety, Rosa Luxemburg has substituted the question of their economic independence. 
 This is just as intelligent as if someone, in discussing the programmatic demand forthe supremacy of parliament, i. 
e. 
, the assembly of people’srepresentatives, in a bourgeois state, were to expound theperfectly correct conviction that big capital dominates ina bourgeois country, whatever the regime in it. 
 There is no doubt that the greater part of Asia, the most densely populated continent, consists either of coloniesof the “Great Powers”, or of states that are extremely de-pendent and oppressed as nations. 
 But does this commonly-known circumstance in any way shake the undoubted factthat in Asia itself the conditions for the most complete development of commodity production and the freest, wid-est and speediest growth of capitalism have been createdonly in Japan, i. 
e. 
, only in an independent national state?The latter is a bourgeois state, and for that reason has it-self begun to oppress other nations and to enslave colonies. 
We cannot say whether Asia will have had time to develop into a system of independent national states, like Europe, before the collapse of capitalism, but it remains an undis-puted fact that capitalism, having awakened Asia, has calledforth national movements everywhere in that continent,too; that the tendency of these movements is towards thecreation of national states in Asia; that it is such states that ensure the best conditions for the development of cap-italism. 
 The example of Asia speaks in favour of Kautsky and against Rosa Luxemburg. 
 The example of the Balkan states likewise contradicts her, for anyone can now see that the best conditions for the development of capitalism in the Balkans are created precisely in proportion to the creation of independent na-tional states in that peninsula. 
 Therefore, Rosa Luxemburg notwithstanding, the ex-ample of the whole of progressive and civilised mankind,the example of the Balkans and that of Asia prove that Kautsky’s proposition is absolutely correct: the national state is the rule and the “norm” of capitalism; the multi-national state represents backwardness, or is an exception. 
From the standpoint of national relations, the best condi-tions for the development of capitalism are undoubtedlyprovided by the national state. 
 This does not mean, of course, that such a state, which is based on bourgeois relations, can eliminate the exploitation and oppression of nations. 
It only means that Marxists cannot lose sight of thepowerful economic factors that give rise to the urge to create national states. 
 It means that “self-determination of nations”in the Marxists’ Programme cannot , from a historico-eco-nomic point of view, have any other meaning than polit-ical self-determination, state independence, and the for-mation of a national state. 
 The conditions under which the bourgeois-democratic demand for a “national state” should be supported froma Marxist, i. 
e. 
, class-proletarian, point of view will be dealt with in detail below. 
 For the present, we shall confine ourselves to the definition of the concept of “self-determi-nation”, and only note that Rosa Luxemburg knows what this concept means (“national state”), whereas her oppor-tunist partisans, the Liebmans, the Semkovskys, the Yur-keviches, do not even know that ! 2. 
 THE HISTORICALLY CONCRETE PRESENTATION OF THE QUESTION The categorical requirement of Marxist theory in in-vestigating any social question is that it be examined within definite historical limits, and, if it refers to a partic-ular country (e. 
g. 
, the national programme for a givencountry), that account be taken of the specific features distinguishing that country from others in the same histor-ical epoch. 
 What does this categorical requirement of Marxism imply in its application to the question under discussion? First of all, it implies that a clear distinction must be drawn between the two periods of capitalism, which differradically from each other as far as the national movementis concerned. 
 On the one hand, there is the period of the collapse of feudalism and absolutism, the period of the formation of the bourgeois-democratic society and state,when the national movements for the first time becomemass movements and in one way or another draw all classes of the population into politics through the press, partic-ipation in representative institutions, etc. 
 On the other hand, there is the period of fully formed capitalist states with a long-established constitutional regime and a highlydeveloped antagonism between the proletariat and thebourgeoisie—a period that may be called the eve of capi-talism’s downfall. 
 The typical features of the first period are: the awakening of national movements and the drawing of the peasants, the most numerous and the most sluggish section of thepopulation, into these movements, in connection withthe struggle for political liberty in general, and for therights of the nation in particular. 
 Typical features of thesecond period are: the absence of mass bourgeois-democratic movements and the fact that developed capitalism, in bringing closer together nations that have already beenfully drawn into commercial intercourse, and causing themto intermingle to an increasing degree, brings the antago-nism between internationally united capital and the in-ternational working-class movement into the forefront. 
 Of course, the two periods are not walled off from each other; they are connected by numerous transitional links,the various countries differing from each other in the ra-pidity of their national development, in the national make-up and distribution of their population, and so on. 
 Therecan be no question of the Marxists of any country drawing up their national programme without taking into account all these general historical and concrete state condi-tions. 
 It is here that we come up against the weakest point in Rosa Luxemburg’s arguments. 
 With extraordinary zeal, she embellishes her article with a collection of hard words directed against §9 of our Programme, which she declaresto be “sweeping”, “a platitude”, “a metaphysical phrase”,and so on without end. 
 It would be natural to expect anauthor who so admirably condemns metaphysics (in theMarxist sense, i. 
e. 
, anti-dialectics) and empty abstractions to set us an example of how to make a concrete historical analysis of the question. 
 The question at issue is the nationalprogramme of the Marxists of a definite country—Russia,in a definite period—the beginning of the twentieth century. 
But does Rosa Luxemburg raise the question as to what historical period Russia is passing through, or what are the concrete features of the national question and the national movements of that particular country in that particular period? No, she does not! She says absolutely nothing about it ! In her work you will not find even the shadow of an anal-ysis of how the national question stands in Russia in the present historical period, or of the specific features of Rus-sia in this particular respect! We are told that the national question in the Balkans is presented differently from that in Ireland; that Marxappraised the Polish and Czech national movements in theconcrete conditions of 1848 in such and such a way (a page of excerpts from Marx); that Engels appraised the struggle of the forest cantons of Switzerland against Austria and theBattle of Morgarten which took place in 1315 in such andsuch a way (a page of quotations from Engels with theappropriate comments from Kautsky), that Lassalle regardedthe peasant war in Germany of the sixteenth century as reactionary, etc. 
 It cannot be said that these remarks and quotations have any novelty about them, but at all events it is interestingfor the reader to be occasionally reminded just how Marx,Engels and Lassalle approached the analysis of concretehistorical problems in individual countries. 
 And a perusal of these instructive quotations from Marx and Engels re-veals most strikingly the ridiculous position Rosa Luxem-burg has placed herself in. 
 She preaches eloquently and angrily the need for a concrete historical analysis of the national question in different countries at different times, but she does not make the least attempt to determine what historical stage in the development of capitalism Russia is passing through at the beginning of the twentieth cen-tury, or what the specific features of the national question in this country are. 
 Rosa Luxemburg gives examples ofhow others have treated the question in a Marxist fashion, as if deliberately stressing how often the road to hell is paved with good intentions and how often good counselcovers up unwillingness or inability to follow such advicein practice. 
 Here is one of her edifying comparisons. 
 In protesting against the demand for the independence of Poland, Rosa Luxemburg refers to a pamphlet she wrote in 1898, proving the rapid “industrial development of Poland”, with the lat-ter’s manufactured goods being marketed in Russia. 
 Need-less to say, no conclusion whatever can be drawn from thison the question of the right to self-determination; it only proves the disappearance of the old Poland of the landed gentry, etc. 
 But Rosa Luxemburg always passes on imper-ceptibly to the conclusion that among the factors that uniteRussia and Poland, the purely economic factors of moderncapitalist relations now predominate. 
 Then our Rosa proceeds to the question of autonomy, and though her article is entitled “The National Question and Autonomy” in general , she begins to argue that the Kingdom of Poland has an exclusive right to autonomy (see Prosveshcheniye , 1913, No. 
 12 *). 
 To support Poland’s right to autonomy, Rosa Luxemburg evidently judges thestate system of Russia by her economic, political and so-ciological characteristics and everyday life—a totality of features which, taken together, produce the concept of “Asiatic despotism”. 
 ( Przegl Zd No. 
 12, p. 
 137. 
) It is generally known that this kind of state system pos-sesses great stability whenever completely patriarchaland pre-capitalist features predominate in the economicsystem and where commodity production and class differ-entiation are scarcely developed. 
 However, if in a country *See pp. 
 45-51 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 whose state system is distinctly pre-capitalist in character there exists a nationally demarcated region where capital-ism is rapidly developing, then the more rapidly that capitalism develops, the greater will be the antagonismbetween it and the pre-capitalist state system, and the more likely will be the separation of the progressive regionfrom the whole—with which it is connected, not by “moderncapitalistic”, but by “Asiatically despotic” ties. 
 Thus, Rosa Luxemburg does not get her arguments to hang together even on the question of the social structureof the government in Russia with regard to bourgeois Po-land; as for the concrete, historical, specific features of thenational movements in Russia—she does not even raisethat question. 
 That is a point we must now deal with. 
 3. 
 THE CONCRETE FEATURES OF THE NATIONAL QUESTION IN RUSSIA, AND RUSSIA’S BOURGEOIS-DEMOCRATIC REFORMATION “Despite the elasticity of the principle of ‘the right of nations to self-determination’, which is a mere platitude, and, obviously, equally applicable, not only to the nations inhabiting Russia, but also to the nations inhabiting Germany and Austria, Switzerlandand Sweden, America and Australia, we do not find it in the pro-grammes of any of the present-day socialist parties .... 
” ( Przegl Zd No. 
 6, p. 
 483. 
) This is how Rosa Luxemburg opens her attack upon §9 of the Marxist programme. 
 In trying to foist on us the con-ception that this clause in the programme is a “mere plat-itude”, Rosa Luxemburg herself falls victim to this error,alleging with amusing boldness that this point is, “obvi-ously, equally applicable” to Russia, Germany, etc. 
 Obviously, we shall reply, Rosa Luxemburg has decided to make her article a collection of errors in logic that couldbe used for schoolboy exercises. 
 For Rosa Luxemburg’stirade is sheer nonsense and a mockery of the historicallyconcrete presentation of the question. 
 If one interprets the Marxist programme in Marxist fashion, not in a childish way, one will without difficulty grasp the fact that it refers to bourgeois-democratic nationalmovements. 
 That being the case, it is “obvious” that this programme “sweepingly”, and as a “mere platitude”, etc. 
, covers all instances of bourgeois-democratic national move-ments. 
 No less obvious to Rosa Luxemburg, if she gave the slightest thought to it, is the conclusion that our pro-gramme refers only to cases where such a movement is actually in existence. 
 Had she given thought to these obvious considerations, Rosa Luxemburg would have easily perceived what non-sense she was talking. 
 In accusing us of uttering a “plati-tude” she has used against us the argument that no mention is made of the right to self-determination in the pro-grammes of countries where there are no bourgeois-democratic national movements. 
 A remarkably clever argument! A comparison of the political and economic development of various countries, as well as of their Marxist programmes, is of tremendous importance from the standpoint of Marx-ism, for there can be no doubt that all modern states areof a common capitalist nature and are therefore subject to acommon law of development. 
 But such a comparison mustbe drawn in a sensible way. 
 The elementary condition for comparison is to find out whether the historical periods of development of the countries concerned are at all compar-able . 
 For instance, only absolute ignoramuses (such as Prince Y. 
 Trubetskoi in Russkaya Mysl ) are capable of “comparing” the Russian Marxists’ agrarian programme with the programmes of Western Europe, since our pro-gramme replies to questions that concern the bourgeois-democratic agrarian reform, whereas in the Western countries no such question arises. 
 The same applies to the national question. 
 In most West-ern countries it was settled long ago. 
 It is ridiculous toseek an answer to non-existent questions in the programmes of Western Europe. 
 In this respect Rosa Luxemburg has lost sight of the most important thing—the differencebetween countries where bourgeois-democratic reforms havelong been completed, and those where they have not. 
 The crux of the matter lies in this difference. 
 Rosa Lux-emburg’s complete disregard of it transforms her verbose article into a collection of empty and meaningless platitudes. 
 The epoch of bourgeois-democratic revolutions in Western, continental Europe embraces a fairly definite period, approximately between 1789 and 1871. 
 This was precisely the period of national movements and the creation of national states. 
 When this period drew to a close, Western Europe had been transformed into a settled system of bourgeoisstates, which, as a general rule, were nationally uniformstates. 
 Therefore, to seek the right to self-determination inthe programmes of West-European socialists at this timeof day is to betray one’s ignorance of the ABC of Marxism. 
 In Eastern Europe and Asia the period of bourgeois-democratic revolutions did not begin until 1905. 
 The rev-olutions in Russia, Persia, Turkey and China, the Balkanwars—such is the chain of world events of our period in our “Orient”. 
 And only a blind man could fail to see in thischain of events the awakening of a whole series of bourgeois-democratic national movements which strive to create nationally independent and nationally uniform states. 
It is precisely and solely because Russia and the neighbouringcountries are passing through this period that we musthave a clause in our programme on the right of nations toself-determination. 
 But let us continue the quotation from Rosa Luxemburg’s article a little more. 
 She writes: “In particular, the programme of a party which is operating in a state with an extremely varied national composition, and for whichthe national question is a matter of first-rate importance—the pro-gramme of the Austrian Social-Democratic Party—does not contain the principle of the right of nations to self-determination. 
” (Ibid. 
) Thus, an attempt is made to convince the reader by the example of Austria “in particular”. 
 Let us examine thisexample in the light of concrete historical facts and seejust how sound it is. 
 In the first place, let us pose the fundamental question of the completion of the bourgeois-democratic revolution. 
 In Austria, this revolution began in 1848 and was over in1867. 
 Since then, a more or less fully established bourgeoisconstitution has dominated, for nearly half a century, andon its basis a legal workers’ party is legally functioning. 
 Therefore, in the internal conditions of Austria’s devel-opment (i. 
e. 
, from the standpoint of the development of capitalism in Austria in general, and among its variousnations in particular), there are no factors that produce leaps and bounds, a concomitant of which might be the formation of nationally independent states. 
 In assuming, by her comparison, that Russia is in an analogous position in this respect, Rosa Luxemburg not only makes a funda-mentally erroneous and anti-historical assumption, butalso involuntarily slips into liquidationism. 
 Secondly, the profound difference in the relations between the nationalities in Austria and those in Russia is partic-ularly important for the question we are concerned with. 
 Not only was Austria for a long time a state in which theGermans preponderated, but the Austrian Germans laidclaim to hegemony in the German nation as a whole. 
 This“claim”, as Rosa Luxemburg (who is seemingly so averseto commonplaces, platitudes, abstractions...) will perhaps be kind enough to remember, was shattered in the war of 1866. 
 The German nation predominating in Austria founditself outside the pale of the independent German state which finally took shape in 1871. 
 On the other hand, theHungarians’ attempt to create an independent nationalstate collapsed under the blows of the Russian serf army as far back as 1849. 
 A very peculiar situation was thus created—a striving on the part of the Hungarians and then of the Czechs, notfor separation from Austria, but, on the contrary, for thepreservation of Austria’s integrity, precisely in order topreserve national independence, which might have been completely crushed by more rapacious and powerful neigh-bours! Owing to this peculiar situation, Austria assumedthe form of a dual state, and she is now being transformedinto a triple state (Germans, Hungarians, Slavs). 
 Is there anything like this in Russia? Is there in our country a striving of the “subject peoples” for unity with the Great Russians in face of the danger of worse national oppression? One need only pose this question in order to see that the comparison between Russia and Austria on the questionof self-determination of nations is meaningless, platitu-dinous and ignorant. 
 The peculiar conditions in Russia with regard to the national question are just the reverse of those we see inAustria. 
 Russia is a state with a single national centre— Great Russia. 
 The Great Russians occupy a vast, unbroken stretch of territory, and number about 70,000,000. 
 The specific features of this national state are: first, that “subject peoples” (which, on the whole, comprise the major-ity of the entire population—57 per cent) inhabit theborder regions; secondly, the oppression of these subjectpeoples is much stronger here than in the neighbouringstates (and not even in the European states alone); thirdly, in a number of cases the oppressed nationalities inhabit-ing the border regions have compatriots across the border,who enjoy greater national independence (suffice it to men-tion the Finns, the Swedes, the Poles, the Ukrainians andthe Rumanians along the western and southern frontiersof the state); fourthly, the development of capitalism and the general level of culture are often higher in the non-Russian border regions than in the centre. 
 Lastly, it is inthe neighbouring Asian states that we see the beginning of aphase of bourgeois revolutions and national movementswhich are spreading to some of the kindred nationalitieswithin the borders of Russia. 
 Thus, it is precisely the special concrete, historical features of the national question in Russia that make therecognition of the right of nations to self-determination inthe present period a matter of special urgency in our country. 
 Incidentally, even from the purely factual angle, Rosa Luxemburg’s assertion that the Austrian Social-Democrats’ programme does not contain any recognition of the right of nations to self-determination is incorrect. 
 We need onlyopen the Minutes of the Brünn Congress, which adoptedthe national programme, 181 to find the statements by the Ruthenian Social-Democrat Hankiewicz on behalf of theentire Ukrainian (Ruthenian) delegation (p. 
 85 of the Min-utes), and by the Polish Social-Democrat Reger on behalf of the entire Polish delegation (p. 
 108), to the effect thatone of the aspirations of the Austrian Social-Democratsof both the above-mentioned nations is to secure nationalunity, and the freedom and independence of their nations. 
Hence, while the Austrian Social-Democrats did not in-clude the right of nations to self-determination directly in their programme, they did nevertheless allow the demandfor national independence to be advanced by sections of the party. 
 In effect, this means, of course, the recognition of the right of nations to self-determination! Thus, Rosa Luxemburg’s reference to Austria speaks against Rosa Lux-emburg in all respects. 
 4. 
 “PRACTICALITY” IN THE NATIONAL QUESTION Rosa Luxemburg’s argument that §9 of our Programme contains nothing “practical” has been seized upon by the Opportunists. 
 Rosa Luxemburg is so delighted with thisargument that in some parts of her article this “slogan”is repeated eight times on a single page. 
 She writes: §9 “gives no practical lead on the day-by-day policy of the proletariat, no practical solution of national problems”. 
 Let us examine this argument, which elsewhere is formu-lated in such a way that it makes §9 look quite meaning-less, or else commits us to support all national aspirations. 
 What does the demand for “practicality” in the national question mean? It means one of three things: support for all national aspirations; the answer “yes” or “no” to the question of se-cession by any nation; or that national demands are ingeneral immediately “practicable”. 
 Let us examine all three possible meanings of the demand for “practicality”. 
 The bourgeoisie, which naturally assumes the leadership at the start of every national movement, says that supportfor all national aspirations is practical. 
 However, the pro-letariat’s policy in the national question (as in all others)supports the bourgeoisie only in a certain direction, but itnever coincides with the bourgeoisie’s policy. 
 The working class supports the bourgeoisie only in order to secure na-tional peace (which the bourgeoisie cannot bring aboutcompletely and which can be achieved only with complete democracy), in order to secure equal rights and to createthe best conditions for the class struggle. 
 Therefore, it isin opposition to the practicality of the bourgeoisie that the proletarians advance their principles in the national ques-tion; they always give the bourgeoisie only conditional support. 
 What every bourgeoisie is out for in the national question is either privileges for its own nation, or excep-tional advantages for it; this is called being “practical”. 
 The proletariat is opposed to all privileges, to all exclu-siveness. 
 To demand that it should be “practical” meansfollowing the lead of the bourgeoisie, falling intoopportunism. 
 The demand for a “yes” or “no” reply to the question of secession in the case of every nation may seem a very “prac-tical” one. 
 In reality it is absurd; it is metaphysical in theory, while in practice it leads to subordinating the pro-letariat to the bourgeoisie’s policy. 
 The bourgeoisie alwaysplaces its national demands in the forefront, and does soin categorical fashion. 
 With the proletariat, however, thesedemands are subordinated to the interests of the class strug-gle. 
 Theoretically, you cannot say in advance whether the bourgeois-democratic revolution will end in a given nationseceding from another nation, or in its equality with thelatter; in either case , the important thing for the proletar-iat is to ensure the development of its class. 
 For the bour-geoisie it is important to hamper this development by pushing the aims of its “own” nation before those of the proletariat. 
 That is why the proletariat confines itself,so to speak, to the negative demand for recognition of theright to self-determination, without giving guarantees to any nation, and without undertaking to give anything at the expense of another nation. 
 This may not be “practical”, but it is in effect the best guarantee for the achievement of the most democratic ofall possible solutions. 
 The proletariat needs only such guarantees, whereas the bourgeoisie of every nation requiresguarantees for its own interest, regardless of the position of (or the possible disadvantages to) other nations. 
 The bourgeoisie is most of all interested in the “feasi-bility” of a given demand—hence the invariable policyof coming to terms with the bourgeoisie of other nations,to the detriment of the proletariat. 
 For the proletariat, how-ever, the important thing is to strengthen its class againstthe bourgeoisie and to educate the masses in the spirit of consistent democracy and socialism. 
 This may not be “practical” as far as the opportunists are concerned, but it is the only real guarantee, the guar-antee of the greater national equality and peace, despite the feudal landlords and the nationalist bourgeoisie. 
 The whole task of the proletarians in the national question is “unpractical” from the standpoint of the nationalist bourgeoisie of every nation, because the proletarians, op-posed as they are to nationalism of every kind, demand“abstract” equality; they demand, as a matter of prin-ciple, that there should be no privileges, however slight. 
 Failing to grasp this, Rosa Luxemburg, by her misguided eulogy of practicality, has opened the door wide for theopportunists, and especially for opportunist concessionsto Great-Russian nationalism. 
 Why Great-Russian? Because the Great Russians in Rus-sia are an oppressor nation, and opportunism in the na-tional question will of course find expression among op-pressed nations otherwise than among oppressor nations. 
 On the plea that its demands are “practical”, the bour-geoisie of the oppressed nations will call upon the prole-tariat to support its aspirations unconditionally. 
 The mostpractical procedure is to say a plain “yes” in favour of the secession of a particular nation rather than in favour of all nations having the right to secede! The proletariat is opposed to such practicality. 
 While recognising equality and equal rights to a national state,it values above all and places foremost the alliance of theproletarians of all nations, and assesses any national de-mand, any national separation, from the angle of the work-ers’ class struggle. 
 This call for practicality is in factmerely a call for uncritical acceptance of bourgeois aspira-tions. 
 By supporting the right to secession, we are told, you are supporting the bourgeois nationalism of the oppressed nations. 
 This is what Rosa Luxemburg says, and she is echoed by Semkovsky, the opportunist, who incidentallyis the only representative of liquidationist ideas on thisquestion, in the liquidationist newspaper! Our reply to this is: No, it is to the bourgeoisie that a “practical” solution of this question is important. 
 To the workers the important thing is to distinguish the principles of the two trends. 
 Insofar as the bourgeoisie of the oppressed nation fights the oppressor, we are always, in every case, and more strongly than anyone else, in favour , for we are the staunchest and the most consistent enemies of oppres-sion. 
 But insofar as the bourgeoisie of the oppressed na-tion stands for its own bourgeois nationalism, we stand against. 
 We fight against the privileges and violence of theoppressor nation, and do not in any way condone strivingsfor privileges on the part of the oppressed nation. 
 If, in our political agitation, we fail to advance and ad-vocate the slogan of the right to secession, we shall play into the hands, not only of the bourgeoisie, but also of thefeudal landlords and the absolutism of the oppressor na-tion. 
 Kautsky long ago used this argument against RosaLuxemburg, and the argument is indisputable. 
 When, inher anxiety not to “assist” the nationalist bourgeoisie of Poland, Rosa Luxemburg rejects the right to secession in the programme of the Marxists in Russia , she is in fact as-sisting the Great-Russian Black Hundreds. 
 She is in factassisting opportunist tolerance of the privileges (and worsethan privileges) of the Great Russians. 
 Carried away by the struggle against nationalism in Po-land, Rosa Luxemburg has forgotten the nationalism of the Great Russians, although it is this nationalism that is the most formidable at the present time. 
 It is a nation-alism that is more feudal than bourgeois, and is the prin-cipal obstacle to democracy and to the proletarian struggle. 
The bourgeois nationalism of any oppressed nation has a general democratic content that is directed against op-pression, and it is this content that we unconditionally support. 
 At the same time we strictly distinguish it fromthe tendency towards national exclusiveness; we fightagainst the tendency of the Polish bourgeois to oppress theJews, etc. 
, etc. 
 This is “unpractical” from the standpoint of the bour-geois and the philistine, but it is the only policy in thenational question that is practical, based on principles,and really promotes democracy, liberty and proletarianunity. 
 The recognition of the right to secession for all; the ap-praisal of each concrete question of secession from the point of view of removing all inequality, all privileges, and allexclusiveness. 
 Let us consider the position of an oppressor nation. 
 Can a nation be free if it oppresses other nations? It cannot. 
 The interests of the freedom of the Great-Russian population * require a struggle against such oppression. 
 The long, cen-turies-old history of the suppression of the movementsof the oppressed nations, and the systematic propagandain favour of such suppression coming from the “upper” classes have created enormous obstacles to the cause of free-dom of the Great-Russian people itself, in the form of preju-dices, etc. 
 The Great-Russian Black Hundreds deliberately foster these prejudices and encourage them. 
 The Great-Russianbourgeoisie tolerates or condones them. 
 The Great-Russianproletariat cannot achieve its own aims or clear the road to its freedom without systematically countering these pre-judices. 
 In Russia, the creation of an independent national state remains, for the time being, the privilege of the Great-Russian nation alone. 
 We, the Great-Russian proletarians,who defend no privileges whatever, do not defend this priv-ilege either. 
 We are fighting on the ground of a definite state; we unite the workers of all nations living in thisstate; we cannot vouch for any particular path of nationaldevelopment, for we are marching to our class goal alongall possible paths. 
 However, we cannot move towards that goal unless we combat all nationalism, and uphold the equality of thevarious nations. 
 Whether the Ukraine, for example, isdestined to form an independent state is a matter that willbe determined by a thousand unpredictable factors. 
 Withoutattempting idle “ guesses ”, we firmly uphold something that is beyond doubt: the right of the Ukraine to form such a state. 
 We respect this right; we do not uphold the privileges of Great Russians with regard to Ukrainians; we educate the masses in the spirit of recognition of that right, in thespirit of rejecting state privileges for any nation. 
 *A certain L. 
 Vl. 
182 in Paris considers this word un-Marxist. 
 This L. 
 Vl. 
 is amusingly “ superklug ” (too clever by half). 
 And “this too-clever-by-half” L. 
 Vl. 
 apparently intends to write an essay on the deletion of the words “population”, “nation”, etc. 
, from our mini-mum programme (having in mind the class struggle!). 
 In the leaps which all nations have made in the period of bourgeois revolutions, clashes and struggles over the right to a national state are possible and probable. 
 We proletarians declare in advance that we are opposed to Great-Russian privileges, and this is what guides our entire prop-aganda and agitation. 
 In her quest for “practicality” Rosa Luxemburg has lost sight of the principal practical task both of the Great-Rus-sian proletariat and of the proletariat of other nationalities: that of day-by-day agitation and propaganda against allstate and national privileges, and for the right, the equalright of all nations, to their national state. 
 This (at present)is our principal task in the national question, for only inthis way can we defend the interests of democracy and the alliance of all proletarians of all nations on an equal footing. 
 This propaganda may be “unpractical” from the point of view of the Great-Russian oppressors, as well as from thepoint of view of the bourgeoisie of the oppressed nations(both demand a definite “yes” or “no”, and accuse the Social-Democrats of being “vague”). 
 In reality it is this propaganda, and this propaganda alone, that ensures the genuinely dem-ocratic, the genuinely socialist education of the masses. 
This is the only propaganda to ensure the greatest chances ofnational peace in Russia, should she remain a multi-nation-al state, and the most peaceful (and for the proletarian class struggle, harmless) division into separate national states, should the question of such a division arise. 
 To explain this policy—the only proletarian policy—in the national question more concretely, we shall examine the atti-tude of Great-Russian liberalism towards the “self-deter-mination of nations”, and the example of Norway’s seces-sion from Sweden. 
 5. 
 THE LIBERAL BOURGEOISIE AND THE SOCIALIST OPPORTUNISTS IN THE NATIONAL QUESTION We have seen that the following argument is one of Rosa Luxemburg’s “trump cards” in her struggle against the pro-gramme of the Marxists in Russia: recognition of the right to self-determination is tantamount to supporting the bour-geois nationalism of the oppressed nations. 
 On the other hand, she says, if we take this right to mean no more than combating all violence against other nations, there is noneed for a special clause in the programme, for Social-Dem-ocrats are, in general, opposed to all national oppressionand inequality. 
 The first argument, as Kautsky irrefutably proved nearly twenty years ago, is a case of blaming other people for one’s own nationalism, in her fear of the nationalism ofthe bourgeoisie of oppressed nations, Rosa Luxemburg isactually playing into the hands of the Black-Hundred na-tionalism of the Great Russians! Her second argument isactually a timid evasion of the question whether or not rec-ognition of national equality includes recognition of the right to secession. 
 If it does, then Rosa Luxemburg admitsthat, in principle, §9 of our Programme is correct. 
 If itdoes not, then she does not recognise national equality. 
Shuflling and evasions will not help matters here! However, the best way to test these and all similar ar-guments is to study the attitude of the various classes of society towards this question. 
 For the Marxist this testis obligatory. 
 We must proceed from what is objective;we must examine the relations between the classes on thispoint. 
 In failing to do so, Rosa Luxemburg is guilty ofthose very sins of metaphysics, abstractions, platitudes, and sweeping statements, etc. 
, of which she vainly tries to accuse her opponents. 
 We are discussing the Programme of the Marxists in Russia , i. 
e. 
, of the Marxists of all the nationalities in Rus-sia. 
 Should we not examine the position of the ruling classes of Russia? The position of the “bureaucracy” (we beg pardon for this inaccurate term) and of the feudal landlords of ourunited-nobility type is well known. 
 They definitely rejectboth the equality of nationalities and the right to self-determination. 
 Theirs is the old motto of the days of serf-dom: autocracy, orthodoxy, and the national essence—the last term applying only to the Great-Russian nation. 
 Even the Ukrainians are declared to be an “alien” people andtheir very language is being suppressed. 
 Let us glance, at the Russian bourgeoisie, which was “called upon” to take part—a very modest part, it is true, but nevertheless some part—in the government, under the “June Third” legislative and administrative system. 
 Itwill not need many words to prove that the Octobrists arefollowing the Rights in this question. 
 Unfortunately, someMarxists pay much less attention to the stand of the Great-Russian liberal bourgeoisie, the Progressists and the Cadets. 
 Yet he who fails to study that stand and give it careful thought will inevitably flounder in abstractions andgroundless statements in discussing the question of the rightof nations to self-determination. 
 Skilled though it is in the art of diplomatically evading direct answers to “unpleasant” questions, Rech , the prin-cipal organ of the Constitutional-Democratic Party, was compelled, in its controversy with Pravda last year, to make certain valuable admissions. 
 The trouble started overthe All-Ukraine Students’ Congress held in Lvov in thesummer of 1913. 
 183 Mr. 
 Mogilyansky, the “Ukrainian ex-pert” or Ukrainian correspondent of Rech , wrote an article in which he poured vitriolic abuse (“ravings”, “adventu-rism”, etc. 
) on the idea that the Ukraine should secede, anidea which Dontsov, a nationalist-socialist, had advocatedand the above-mentioned congress approved. 
 While in no way identifying itself with Mr. 
 Dontsov, and declaring explicitly that he was a nationalist-socialist and that many Ukrainian Marxists did not agree with him, Ra-bochaya Pravda stated that the tone of Rech , or, rather, the way it formulated the question in principle , was improper and reprehensible for a Great-Russian democrat, or foranyone desiring to pass as a democrat. 
 * Let Rech repudiate the Dontsovs if it likes, but, from the standpoint of principle , a Great-Russian organ of democracy, which it claims to be, cannot be oblivious of the freedom to secede, the right to secede. 
 A few months later, Rech , No. 
 331, published an “expla-nation” from Mr. 
 Mogilyansky, who had learned from theUkrainian newspaper Shlyakhi ,184 published in Lvov, of Mr. 
 Dontsov’s reply, in which, incidentally, Dontsov *See present edition, Vol. 
 19, pp. 
 268-69. 
— Ed. 
 stated that “the chauvinist attacks in Rech have been prop-erly sullied [branded?] only in the Russian Social-Dem-ocratic press”. 
 This “explanation” consisted of the thrice-repeated statement that “criticism of Mr. 
 Dontsov’s recipes”“has nothing in common with the repudiation of the rightof nations to self-determination”. 
 “It must be said,” wrote Mr. 
 Mogilyansky, “that even ‘the right of nations to self-determination’ is not a fetish [mark this!] beyondcriticism: unwholesome conditions in the life of nations may giverise to unwholesome tendencies in national self-determination, and the fact that these are brought to light does not mean that the right of nations to self-determination has been rejected. 
” As you see, this liberal’s talk of a “fetish” was quite in keeping with Rosa Luxemburg’s. 
 It was obvious that Mr. 
 Mogilyansky was trying to evade a direct reply to the ques-tion whether or not he recognised the right to politicalself-determination, i. 
e. 
, to secession. 
 The newspaper Proletarskaya Pravda , issue No. 
 4, for December 11, 1913, also put this question point-blank to Mr. 
 Mogilyansky and to the Constitutional-Democratic Party . 
 * Thereupon Rech (No. 
 340) published an unsigned, i. 
e. 
, official, editorial statement replying to this question. 
 Thisreply boils down to the following three points: 1) §11 of the Constitutional-Democratic Party’s pro-gramme speaks bluntly, precisely and clearly of the “right of nations to free cultural self-determination”. 
 2) Rech affirms that Proletarskaya Pravda “hopelessly confuses” self-determination with separatism, with the se-cession of a given nation. 
 3) “ Actually , the Cadets have never pledged themselves to advocate the right of ‘nations to secede ’ from the Russian state . 
” (See the article “National-Liberalism and the Right of Nations to Self-Determination”, in Proletarskaya Pravda No. 
 12, December 20, 1913. 
 **) Let us first consider the second point in the Rech state-ment. 
 How strikingly it shows to the Semkovskys, Liebmans,Yurkeviches and other opportunists that the hue and cry *See present edition, Vol. 
 19, pp. 
 525-27. 
— Ed. 
 **See pp. 
 56-58 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 they have raised about the alleged “vagueness”, or “indef-initeness”, of the term “self-determination” is in fact , i. 
e. 
, from the standpoint of objective class relationships and the class struggle in Russia, simply a rehash of the liber-al-monarchist bourgeoisie’s utterances! Proletarskaya Pravda put the following three questions to the enlightened “Constitutional-Democratic” gentlemenof Rech : (1) do they deny that, throughout the entire his-tory of international democracy, and especially since the middle of the nineteenth century, self-determination of nationshas been understood to mean precisely political self-deter-mination, the right to form an independent national state?(2) do they deny that the well-known resolution adoptedby the International Socialist Congress in London in 1896 has the same meaning? and (3) do they deny that Plekha-nov, in writing about self-determination as far back as1902, meant precisely political self-determination? WhenProletarskaya Pravda posed these three questions, the Ca-dets fell silent ! Not a word did they utter in reply, for they had nothing to say. 
 They had to admit tacitly that Proletarskaya Prav-da was absolutely right. 
 The liberals’ outcries that the term “self-determination” is vague and that the Social-Democrats “hopelessly confuse”it with separatism are nothing more than attempts to con-fuse the issue, and evade recognition of a universally es-tablished democratic principle. 
 If the Semkovskys, Lieb-mans and Yurkeviches were not so ignorant, they would beashamed to address the workers in a liberal vein. 
 But to proceed. 
 Proletarskaya Pravda compelled Rech to admit that, in the programme of the Constitutional-Democrats, the term “cultural” self-determination means in effect the repudiation of political self-determination. 
 “Actually, the Cadets have never pledged themselves to advocate the right of ‘nations to secede’ from the Russianstate”—it was not without reason that Proletarskaya Pravda recommended to Novoye Vremya and Zemshchina these words from Rech as an example of our Cadets’ “loyalty”. 
 In its issue No. 
 13563, Novoye Vremya , which never, of course, misses an opportunity of mentioning “the Yids” and takingdigs at the Cadets, nevertheless stated: “What, to the Social-Democrats, is an axiom of political wisdom [i. 
e. 
, recognition of the right of nations to self-determination, tosecede], is today beginning to cause disagreement even among theCadets. 
” By declaring that they “have never pledged themselves to advocate the right of nations to secede from the Russianstate”, the Cadets have, in principle, taken exactly the samestand as Novoye Vremya . 
 This is precisely one of the funda-mentals of Cadet national-liberalism , of their kinship with the Purishkeviches, and of their dependence, political,ideological and practical, on the latter. 
 Proletarskaya Pravda wrote: “The Cadets have studied history and know only too well what—to put it mildly—pogrom-like actionsthe practice of the ancient right of the Purishkeviches to ‘grab ’em and hold ’em’ has often led to. 
” Although perfect-ly aware of the feudalist source and nature of the Purish-keviches’ omnipotence, the Cadets are, nevertheless, tak-ing their stand on the basis of the relationships and frontiers created by that very class. 
 Knowing full well that there ismuch in the relationships and frontiers created or fixed by this class that is un-European and anti-European (we would say Asiatic if this did not sound undeservedly slightingto the Japanese and Chinese), the Cadets, nevertheless,accept them as the utmost limit. 
 Thus, they are adjusting themselves to the Purishkeviches, cringing to them, fearing to jeopardise their position, protecting them from the people’s movement, from the de-mocracy. 
 As Proletarskaya Pravda wrote: “In effect, this means adapting oneself to the interests of the feudal-mindedlandlords and to the worst nationalist prejudices of thedominant nation, instead of systematically combating thoseprejudices. 
” Being men who are familiar with history and claim to be democrats, the Cadets do not even attempt to assert thatthe democratic movement, which is today characteristic ofboth Eastern Europe and Asia and is striving to changeboth on the model of the civilised capitalist countries, isbound to leave intact the boundaries fixed by the feudal epoch, the epoch of the omnipotence of the Purishkeviches and the disfranchisement of wide strata of the bourgeoisieand petty bourgeoisie. 
 The fact that the question raised in the controversy between Proletarskaya Pravda and Rech was not merely a literary question, but one that involved a real political issue of the day, was proved, among other things, by thelast conference of the Constitutional-Democratic Party heldon March 23-25, 1914; in the official report of this confer-ence in Rech (No. 
 83, of March 26, 1914) we read: “A particularly lively discussion also took place on national problems. 
 The Kiev deputies, who were supported by N. 
 V. 
 Nekrasovand A. 
 M. 
 Kolyubakin, pointed out that the national question wasbecoming a key issue, which would have to be faced up to more res-olutely than hitherto. 
 F. 
 F. 
 Kokoshkin pointed out, however [this “however” is like Shchedrin’s “but”—“the ears never grow higher than the forehead, never!”] that both the programme and past politicalexperience demanded that ‘elastic formulas’ of ‘political self-deter-mination of nationalities’ should be handled very carefully. 
” This most remarkable line of reasoning at the Cadet con-ference deserves serious attention from all Marxists and alldemocrats. 
 (We will note in parentheses that Kievskaya Mysl , which is evidently very well informed and no doubt presents Mr. 
 Kokoshkin’s ideas correctly, added that, of course, as a warning to his opponents, he laid special stresson the danger of the “disintegration” of the state. 
) The official report in Rech is composed with consummate diplomatic skill designed to lift the veil as little as possibleand to conceal as much as possible. 
 Yet, in the main, what took place at the Cadet conference is quite clear. 
 The liber-al-bourgeois delegates, who were familiar with the stateof affairs in the Ukraine, and the “Left” Cadets raised thequestion precisely of the political self-determination of na-tions. 
 Otherwise, there would have been no need forMr. 
 Kokoshkin to urge that this “formula” should be “handled carefully”. 
 The Cadet programme, which was of course known to the delegates at the Cadet conference, speaks of “cultural”,not of political self-determination. 
 Hence, Mr. 
 Kokoshkin was defending the programme against the Ukrainian dele-gates, and against the Left Cadets; he was defending “cul-tural” self-determination as opposed to “political” self-determination. 
 It is perfectly clear that in opposing “politi-cal” self-determination, in playing up the danger of the “disintegration of the state”, and in calling the formula “political self-determination” an “ elastic ” one (quite in keep-ing with Rosa Luxemburg!), Mr. 
 Kokoshkin was defend-ing Great-Russian national-liberalism against the more“Left” or more democratic elements of the Constitutional-Democratic Party and also against the Ukrainian bourgeoi-sie. 
 Mr. 
 Kokoshkin won the day at the Cadet conference, as is evident from the treacherous little word “however” in the Rech report; Great-Russian national-liberalism has triumphed among the Cadets. 
 Will not this victory help toclear the minds of those misguided individuals among theMarxists in Russia who, like the Cadets, have also begun tofear the “elastic formulas of political self-determination of nationalities”? Let us, “however”, examine the substance of Mr. 
 Kokosh-kin’s line of thought. 
 By referring to “past political ex-perience” (i. 
e. 
, evidently, the experience of 1905, when theGreat-Russian bourgeoisie took alarm for its nationalprivileges and scared the Cadet Party with its fears), and also by playing up the danger of the “disintegration of the state”, Mr. 
 Kokoshkin showed that he understood perfectlywell that political self-determination can mean nothing elsebut the right to secede and form an independent nationalstate. 
 The question is—how should Mr. 
 Kokoshkin’s fearsbe appraised in the light of democracy in general, and the proletarian class struggle in particular? Mr. 
 Kokoshkin would have us believe that recognition of the right to secession increases the danger of the “disinte-gration of the state”. 
 This is the viewpoint of ConstableMymretsov, whose motto was “grab ’em and hold ’em”. 
From the viewpoint of democracy in general, the very oppo-site is the case: recognition of the right to secession reduces the danger of the “disintegration of the state”. 
 Mr. 
 Kokoshkin argues exactly like the nationalists do. 
 At their last congress they attacked the Ukrainian “Mazep-pists”. 
 The Ukrainian movement, Mr. 
 Savenko and Co. 
exclaimed, threatens to weaken the ties between the Ukraine and Russia, since Austrian Ukrainophilism is strengthen-ing the Ukrainians’ ties with Austria! It remains unexplainedwhy Russia cannot try to “strengthen” her ties with the Ukrainians through the same method that the Savenkos blame Austria for using, i. 
e. 
, by granting the Ukrainians free-dom to use their own language, self-government and an autonomous Diet. 
 The arguments of the Savenkos and Kokoshkins are exact-ly alike, and from the purely logical point of view they areequally ridiculous and absurd. 
 Is it not clear that the moreliberty the Ukrainian nationality enjoys in any particular country, the stronger its ties with that country will be? One would think that this truism could not be disputedwithout totally abandoning all the premises of democracy. 
Can there be greater freedom of nationality, as such, thanthe freedom to secede, the freedom to form an independentnational state? To clear up this question, which has been so confused by the liberals (and by those who are so misguided as toecho them), we shall cite a very simple example. 
 Let ustake the question of divorce. 
 In her article Rosa Luxem-burg writes that the centralised democratic state, whileconceding autonomy to its constituent parts, should retain the most important branches of legislation, including legis-lation on divorce, under the jurisdiction of the centralparliament. 
 The concern that the central authority of thedemocratic state should retain the power to allow divorcecan be readily understood. 
 The reactionaries are opposedto freedom of divorce; they say that it must be “handled carefully”, and loudly declare that it means the “disintegra-tion of the family”. 
 The democrats, however, believe thatthe reactionaries are hypocrites, and that they are actuallydefending the omnipotence of the police and the bureaucra-cy, the privileges of one of the sexes, and the worst kind ofoppression of women. 
 They believe that in actual fact free-dom of divorce will not cause the “disintegration” of family ties, but, on the contrary, will strengthen them on a demo-cratic basis, which is the only possible and durable basis incivilised society. 
 To accuse those who support freedom of self-determina-tion, i. 
e. 
, freedom to secede, of encouraging separatism, is as foolish and hypocritical as accusing those who advocate freedom of divorce of encouraging the destruction of familyties. 
 Just as in bourgeois society the defenders of privilege and corruption, on which bourgeois marriage rests, oppose freedom of divorce, so, in the capitalist state, repudiation of the right to self-determination, i. 
e. 
, the right of nations to secede, means nothing more than defence of the privi-leges of the dominant nation and police methods of adminis-tration, to the detriment of democratic methods. 
 No doubt, the political chicanery arising from all the re-lationships existing in capitalist society sometimes leads members of parliament and journalists to indulge in frivo-lous and even nonsensical twaddle about one or anothernation seceding. 
 But only reactionaries can allow themselvesto be frightened (or pretend to be frightened) by such talk. 
Those who stand by democratic principles, i. 
e. 
, who insistthat questions of state be decided by the mass of the popu-lation, know very well that there is a “tremendous dis-tance” 185 between what the politicians prate about and what the people decide. 
 From their daily experience the massesknow perfectly well the value of geographical and economicties and the advantages of a big market and a big state. 
They will, therefore, resort to secession only when national oppression and national friction make joint life absolutely intolerable and hinder any and all economic intercourse. 
 Inthat case, the interests of capitalist development and ofthe freedom of the class struggle will be best served by seces-sion. 
 Thus, from whatever angle we approach Mr. 
 Kokoshkin’s arguments, they prove to be the height of absurdity and a mockery of the principles of democracy. 
 And yet thereis a modicum of logic in these arguments, the logic of theclass interests of the Great-Russian bourgeoisie. 
 Likemost members of the Constitutional-Democratic Party,Mr. 
 Kokoshkin is a lackey of the money-bags of that bour-geoisie. 
 He defends its privileges in general, and its state privileges in particular. 
 He defends them hand in hand andshoulder to shoulder with Purishkevich, the only differencebeing that Purishkevich puts more faith in the feudalistcudgel, while Kokoshkin and Co. 
 realise that this cudgelwas badly damaged in 1905, and rely more on bourgeois methods of fooling the masses, such as frightening the petty bourgeoisie and the peasants with the spectre of the “disin-tegration of the state”, and deluding them with phrases about blending “people’s freedom” with historical tradition, etc. 
 The liberals’ hostility to the principle of political self-determination of nations can have one, and only one, realclass meaning: national-liberalism, defence of the stateprivileges of the Great-Russian bourgeoisie. 
 And the oppor-tunists among the Marxists in Russia, who today, underthe Third of June regime, are against the right of nations to self-determination—the liquidator Semkovsky, the Bundist Liebman, the Ukrainian petty-bourgeois Yurkevich—areactually following in the wake of the national-liberals, and corrupting the working class with national-liberal ideas. 
 The interests of the working class and of its struggle against capitalism demand complete solidarity and the closest unity of the workers of all nations; they demand resist-ance to the nationalist policy of the bourgeoisie of every nationality. 
 Hence, Social-Democrats would be deviat-ing from proletarian policy and subordinating the workersto the policy of the bourgeoisie if they were to repudiate the right of nations to self-determination, i. 
e. 
, the right of an oppressed nation to secede, or if they were to supportall the national demands of the bourgeoisie of oppressed na-tions. 
 It makes no difference to the hired worker whether he is exploited chiefly by the Great-Russian bourgeoisierather than the non-Russian bourgeoisie, or by the Polish bourgeoisie rather than the Jewish bourgeoisie, etc. 
 The hired worker who has come to understand his class interestsis equally indifferent to the state privileges of the Great-Russian capitalists and to the promises of the Polish or Ukrainian capitalists to set up an earthly paradise when they obtain state privileges. 
 Capitalism is developing and will continue to develop, anyway, both in integral states with a mixed population and in separate national states. 
 In any case the hired worker will be an object of exploi-tation. 
 Successful struggle against exploitation requiresthat the proletariat be free of nationalism, and be absolute-ly neutral, so to speak, in the fight for supremacy that isgoing on among the bourgeoisie of the various nations. 
 If the proletariat of any one nation gives the slightest support to the privileges of its “own” national bourgeoisie,that will inevitably rouse distrust among the proletariat of another nation; it will weaken the international class soli-darity of the workers and divide them, to the delight of the bourgeoisie. 
 Repudiation of the right to self-determination or to secession inevitably means, in practice, support forthe privileges of the dominant nation. 
 We will get even more striking confirmation of this if we take the concrete case of Norway’s secession from Swe-den. 
 6. 
 NORWAY’S SECESSION SWEDEN Rosa Luxemburg cites precisely this example, and dis-cusses it as follows: “The latest event in the history of federative relations, the se-cession of Norway from Sweden—which at the time was hastily seized upon by the social-patriotic Polish press (see the Cracow Naprzó d186) as a gratifying sign of the strength and progressive nature of the ten-dency towards state secession—at once provided striking proof thatfederalism and its concomitant, separation, are in no way an expres-sion of progress or democracy. 
 After the so-called Norwegian ‘revolu-tion’, which meant that the Swedish king was deposed and compelledto leave Norway, the Norwegians coolly proceeded to choose another king, formally rejecting, by a national referendum, the proposal to establish a republic. 
 That which superficial admirers of all nationalmovements and of all semblance of independence proclaimed to be a‘revolution’ was simply a manifestation of peasant and petty-bour-geois particularism, the desire to have a king ‘of their own’ for theirmoney instead of one imposed upon them by the Swedish aristoc-racy, and was, consequently, a movement that had absolutely noth-ing in common with revolution. 
 At the same time, the dissolutionof the union between Sweden and Norway showed once more to whatextent, in this case also, the federation which had existed until thenwas only an expression of purely dynastic interests and, therefore,merely a form of monarchism and reaction. 
” ( Przegl Zd. 
) That is literally all that Rosa Luxemburg has to say on this score! Admittedly, it would have been difficult for her to have revealed the hopelessness of her position more sali-ently than she has done in this particular instance. 
 The question was, and is: do the Social-Democrats in a mixed national state need a programme that recognisesthe right to self-determination or secession? What does the example of Norway, cited by Rosa Luxem-burg, tell us on this point? Our author twists and turns, exercises her wit and rails at Naprzód , but she does not answer the question! Rosa Luxemburg speaks about everything under the sun so as to avoid saying a single word about the actual point at issue! Undoubtedly, in wishing to have a king of their own for their money, and in rejecting, in a national referendum,the proposal to establish a republic, the Norwegian pettybourgeoisie displayed exceedingly bad philistine qualities. 
Undoubtedly, Naprzód displayed equally bad and equally philistine qualities in failing to notice this. 
 But what has all this to do with the case? The question under discussion was the right of nations to self-determination and the attitude to be adopted bythe socialist proletariat towards this right! Why, then,does not Rosa Luxemburg answer this question instead ofbeating about the bush? To a mouse there is no stronger beast than the cat, it is said. 
 To Rosa Luxemburg there is evidently no strongerbeast than the “Fracy”. 
 “Fracy” is the popular term forthe “Polish Socialist Party”, its so-called revolutionary sec-tion, and the Cracow newspaper Naprzód shares the views of that “section”. 
 Rosa Luxemburg is so blinded by her fight against the nationalism of that “section” that she loses sight of everything except Naprzód . 
 If Naprzód says “yes ”, Rosa Luxemburg considers it her sacred duty to say an immediate “no”, without stopping tothink that by so doing she does not reveal independence ofNaprzód , but, on the contrary, her ludicrous dependence on the “Fracy” and her inability to see things from a view-point any deeper and broader than that of the Cracow ant-hill. 
 Naprzód , of course, is a wretched and by no means Marxist organ; but that should not prevent us from properlyanalysing the example of Norway, once we have chosen it. 
 To analyse this example in Marxist fashion, we must deal, not with the vices of the awfully terrible “Fracy”, but, first, with the concrete historical features of the se-cession of Norway from Sweden, and secondly, with thetasks which confronted the proletariat of both countries in connection with this secession. 
 The geographic, economic and language ties between Norway and Sweden are as intimate as those between the Great Russians and many other Slav nations. 
 But the unionbetween Norway and Sweden was not a voluntary one, and in dragging in the question of “federation” Rosa Luxemburg was talking at random, simply because she did not know what to say. 
 Norway was ceded to Sweden by the monarchs during the Napoleonic wars, against the will of the Nor-wegians; and the Swedes had to bring troops into Norwayto subdue her. 
 Despite the very extensive autonomy which Norway en-joyed (she had her own parliament, etc. 
), there was con-stant friction between Norway and Sweden for many decades after the union, and the Norwegians strove hard to throwoff the yoke of the Swedish aristocracy. 
 At last, in August1905, they succeeded: the Norwegian parliament resolvedthat the Swedish king was no longer king of Norway, and inthe referendum held later among the Norwegian people, the overwhelming majority (about 200,000 as against a few hundred) voted for complete separation from Sweden. 
 Aftera short period of indecision, the Swedes resigned themselvesto the fact of secession. 
 This example shows us on what grounds cases of the secession of nations are practicable, and actually occur, under modern economic and political relationships, and the form secession sometimes assumes under conditions of po-litical freedom and democracy. 
 No Social-Democrat will deny—unless he would profess indifference to questions of political freedom and democracy(in which case he is naturally no longer a Social-Democrat)— that this example virtually proves that it is the bounden duty of class-conscious workers to conduct systematic propagandaand prepare the ground for the settlement of conflicts thatmay arise over the secession of nations, not in the “Russianway”, but only in the way they were settled in 1905 between Norway and Sweden. 
 This is exactly what is meant by the demand in the programme for the recognition of the right of nations to self-determination. 
 But Rosa Luxemburg triedto get around a fact that was repugnant to her theory byviolently attacking the philistinism of the Norwegian phi-listines and the Cracow Naprzód ; for she understood perfect-ly well that this historical fact completely refutes her phrases about the right of nations to self-determination being a “utopia”, or like the right “to eat off gold plates”, etc. 
 Suchphrases only express a smug and opportunist belief in the immutability of the present alignment of forces among the nationalities of Eastern Europe. 
 To proceed. 
 In the question of the self-determination of nations, as in every other question, we are interested,first and foremost, in the self-determination of the proletar-iat within a given nation. 
 Rosa Luxemburg modestly evadedthis question too, for she realised that an analysis ofit on the basis of the example of Norway, which she herself had chosen, would be disastrous to her “theory”. 
 What position did the Norwegian and Swedish proletar-iat take, and indeed had to take, in the conflict over seces-sion? After Norway seceded, the class-conscious workers of Norway would naturally have voted for a republic, * and if some socialists voted otherwise it only goes to show how much dense, philistine opportunism there sometimes is in the European socialist movement. 
 There can be no twoopinions about that, and we mention the point only becauseRosa Luxemburg is trying to obscure the issue by speakingoff the mark . 
 We do not know whether the Norwegian social-ist programme made it obligatory for Norwegian Social-Democrats to hold particular views on the question of seces-sion. 
 We will assume that it did not, and that the Norwegiansocialists left it an open question as to what extent theautonomy of Norway gave sufficient scope to wage the classstruggle freely, or to what extent the eternal friction andconflicts with the Swedish aristocracy hindered freedom of economic life. 
 But it cannot be disputed that the Norwegian proletariat had to oppose this aristocracy and supportNorwegian peasant democracy (with all its philistine limi-tations). 
 And the Swedish proletariat? It is common knowledge that the Swedish landed proprietors, abetted by the Swedish clergy, advocated war against Norway. 
 Inasmuch as Norway was much weaker than Sweden, had already experienced aSwedish invasion, and the Swedish aristocracy carries enor-*Since the majority of the Norwegian nation was in favour of a monarchy while the proletariat wanted a republic, the Norwegianproletariat was, generally speaking, confronted with the alterna-tive: either revolution, if conditions were ripe for it, or submission to the will of the majority and prolonged propaganda and agitation work. 
 mous weight in its own country, this advocacy of war pre-sented a grave danger. 
 We may be sure that the Swedish Kokoshkins spent much time and energy in trying to corrupt the minds of the Swedish people by appeals to “handle” the“elastic formulas of political self-determination of nationscarefully” by painting horrific pictures of the danger of the“disintegration of the state” and by assuring them that“people’s freedom” was compatible with the traditions of the Swedish aristocracy. 
 There cannot be the slightest doubt that the Swedish Social-Democrats would have betrayedthe cause of socialism and democracy if they had not foughtwith all their might to combat both the landlord and the“Kokoshkin” ideology and policy, and if they had failed todemand, not only equality of nations in general (to which the Kokoshkins also subscribe), but also the right of nations to self-determination, Norway’s freedom to secede. 
 The close alliance between the Norwegian and Swedish workers, their complete fraternal class solidarity, gained from the Swedish workers’ recognition of the right of theNorwegians to secede. 
 This convinced the Norwegian work-ers that the Swedish workers were not infected with Swedish nationalism, and that they placed fraternity with theNorwegian proletarians above the privileges of the Swedishbourgeoisie and aristocracy. 
 The dissolution of the tiesimposed upon Norway by the monarchs of Europe and theSwedish aristocracy strengthened the ties between the Nor-wegian and Swedish workers. 
 The Swedish workers have proved that in spite of all the vicissitudes of bourgeois policy— bourgeois relations may quite possibly bring about a repeti-tion of the forcible subjection of the Norwegians to theSwedes!—they will be able to preserve and defend the com-plete equality and class solidarity of the workers of both nations in the struggle against both the Swedish and the Norwegian bourgeoisie. 
 Incidentally, this reveals how groundless and even frivo-lous are the attempts sometimes made by the “Fracy”to “use” our disagreements with Rosa Luxemburg againstPolish Social-Democracy. 
 The “Fracy” are not a proletarian or a socialist party, but a petty-bourgeois nationalist party, something like Polish Social-Revolutionaries. 
 There neverhas been, nor could there be, any question of unity between the Russian Social-Democrats and this party. 
 On the other hand no Russian Social-Democrat has ever “repented” of the close relations and unity that have been established with the Polish Social-Democrats. 
 The Polish Social-Democratshave rendered a great historical service by creating thefirst really Marxist, proletarian party in Poland, a countryimbued with nationalist aspirations and passions. 
 Yet theservice the Polish Social-Democrats have rendered is a great one, not because Rosa Luxemburg has talked a lot of nonsense about §9 of the Russian Marxists’ Programme, but de-spite that sad circumstance. 
 The question of the “right to self-determination” is of course not so important to the Polish Social-Democratsas it is to the Russian. 
 It is quite understandable that in their zeal (sometimes a little excessive, perhaps) to combat the nationalistically blinded petty bourgeoisie of Polandthe Polish Social-Democrats should overdo things. 
 NoRussian Marxist has ever thought of blaming the PolishSocial-Democrats for being opposed to the secession of Po-land. 
 These Social-Democrats err only when, like Rosa Lux-emburg, they try to deny the necessity of including the recognition of the right to self-determination in the Pro-gramme of the Russian Marxists. 
 Virtually, this is like attempting to apply relation-ships, understandable by Cracow standards, to all the peoplesand nations inhabiting Russia, including the Great Rus-sians. 
 It means being “Polish nationalists the wrong way round”, not Russian, not international Social-Democrats. 
 For international Social-Democracy stands for the rec-ognition of the right of nations to self-determination. 
This is what we shall now proceed to discuss. 
 7. 
 THE RESOLUTION OF THE LONDON INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS, 1896 This resolution reads: “This Congress declares that it stands for the full right of all na-tions to self-determination [ Selbstbestimmungsrecht ] and expresses its sympathy for the workers of every country now suffering underthe yoke of military, national or other absolutism. 
 This Congresscalls upon the workers of all these countries to join the ranks of theclass-conscious [ Klassenbewusste —those who understand their class interests] workers of the whole world in order jointly to fight for the defeat of international capitalism and for the achievement ofthe aims of international Social-Democracy. 
” * As we have already pointed out, our opportunists—Sem-kovsky, Liebman and Yurkevich—are simply unaware ofthis resolution. 
 But Rosa Luxemburg knows it and quotesthe full text, which contains the same expression as thatcontained in our programme, viz. 
, “self-determination”. 
 How does Rosa Luxemburg remove this obstacle from the path of her “original” theory? Oh, quite simply ... the whole emphasis lies in the second part of the resolution ... its declarative character ... onecan refer to it only by mistake! The feebleness and utter confusion of our author are simply amazing. 
 Usually it is only the opportunists who talk about the consistent democratic and socialist points in theprogramme being mere declarations, and cravenly avoid anopen debate on them. 
 It is apparently not without reasonthat Rosa Luxemburg has this time found herself in the de-plorable company of the Semkovskys, Liebmans and Yur-keviches. 
 Rosa Luxemburg does not venture to state openly whether she regards the above resolution as correct or erro-neous. 
 She shifts and shuffles as if counting on the inatten-tive or ill-informed reader, who forgets the first part of theresolution by the time he has started reading the second, orwho has never heard of the discussion that took place in the socialist press prior to the London Congress. 
 Rosa Luxemburg is greatly mistaken, however, if she imagines that, in the sight of the class-conscious workers ofRussia, she can get away with trampling upon the resolutionof the International on such an important fundamentalissue, without even deigning to analyse it critically. 
 Rosa Luxemburg’s point of view was voiced during the discussions which took place prior to the London Congress,mainly in the columns of Die Neue Zeit , organ of the German *See the official German report of the London Congress: Ver-handlungen und Beschlüsse des internationalen sozialistischen Arbeiter-und Gewerkschafts-Kongresses zu London , vom 27. 
 Juli bis 1. 
 August 1896 , Berlin, 1897, S. 
 18. 
 A Russian pamphlet has been published contain-ing the decisions of international congresses in which the word “self-determination” is wrongly translated as “autonomy”. 
 Marxists; in essence this point of view was defeated in the International ! That is the crux of the matter, which the Russian reader must particularly bear in mind. 
 The debate turned on the question of Poland’s indepen-dence. 
 Three points of view were put forward: 1. 
 That of the “Fracy”, in whose name Haecker spoke. 
 They wanted the International to include in its own programme a demand for the independence of Poland. 
 The motion was not carried and this point of view was defeated in the Interna-tional. 
 2. 
 Rosa Luxemburg’s point of view, viz. 
, the Polish so-cialists should not demand independence for Poland. 
 Thispoint of view entirely precluded the proclamation of theright of nations to self-determination. 
 It was likewise defeat-ed in the International. 
 3. 
 The point of view which was elaborated at the time by K. 
 Kautsky, who opposed Rosa Luxemburg and provedthat her materialism was extremely “one-sided”; according toKautsky, the International could not at the time make theindependence of Poland a point in its programme; but the Polish socialists were fully entitled to put forward such a demand. 
 From the socialists’ point of view it was undoubt-edly a mistake to ignore the tasks of national liberationin a situation where national oppression existed. 
 The International’s resolution reproduces the most es-sential and fundamental propositions in this point of view: on the one hand, the absolutely direct, unequivocal recogni-tion of the full right of all nations to self-determination;on the other hand, the equally unambiguous appeal to theworkers for international unity in their class struggle. 
 We think that this resolution is absolutely correct, and that, to the countries of Eastern Europe and Asia at the beginning of the twentieth century, it is this resolution, with both its parts being taken as an integral whole, thatgives the only correct lead to the proletarian class policy inthe national question. 
 Let us deal with the three above-mentioned viewpoints in somewhat greater detail. 
 As is known, Karl Marx and Frederick Engels considered it the bounden duty of the whole of West-European democracy,and still more of Social-Democracy, to give active support to the demand for Polish independence. 
 For the period of the 1840s and 1860s, the period of the bourgeois revolutions in Austria and Germany, and the period of the “Peasant Reform” in Russia,187 this point of view was quite correct and the only one that was consistently democratic and pro-letarian. 
 So long as the masses of the people in Russia andin most of the Slav countries were still sunk in torpor, solong as there were no independent, mass, democratic move-ments in those countries, the liberation movement of the gentry in Poland assumed an immense and paramount importance from the point of view, not only of Russian, notonly of Slav, but of European democracy as a whole. 
 *188 But while Marx’s standpoint was quite correct for the forties, fifties and sixties or for the third quarter of the nineteenth century, it has ceased to be correct by the twenti-eth century. 
 Independent democratic movements, and even anindependent proletarian movement, have arisen in mostSlav countries, even in Russia, one of the most backwardSlav countries. 
 Aristocratic Poland has disappeared, yield-ing place to capitalist Poland. 
 Under such circumstances Poland could not but lose her exceptional revolutionary im-portance. 
 The attempt of the P. 
S. 
P. 
 (the Polish Socialist Party, the present-day “Fracy”) in 1896 to “establish” for all timethe point of view Marx had held in a different epoch was an attempt to use the letter of Marxism against the spirit of Marxism. 
 The Polish Social-Democrats were therefore quite right in attacking the extreme nationalism of the Polishpetty bourgeoisie and pointing out that the national ques-tion was of secondary importance to Polish workers, in *It would be a very interesting piece of historical research to compare the position of a noble Polish rebel in 1863 with that of theall-Russia revolutionary democrat, Chernyshevsky, who (like Marx),was able to appreciate the importance of the Polish movement, andwith that of the Ukrainian petty bourgeois Dragomanov, who appeared much later and expressed the views of a peasant, so ignorant and sluggish, and so attached to his dung heap, that his legitimate hatredof the Polish gentry blinded him to the significance which theirstruggle had for all-Russia democracy. 
 (Cf. 
 Dragomanov, Historical Poland and Great-Russian Democracy . 
) Dragomanov richly deserved the fervent kisses which were subsequently bestowed on him by Mr. 
 P. 
 B. 
 Struve, who by that time had become a national-liberal. 
 creating for the first time a purely proletarian party in Poland and proclaiming the extremely important principle that the Polish and the Russian workers must maintain the closest alliance in their class struggle. 
 But did this mean that at the beginning of the twentieth century the International could regard the principle of po-litical self-determination of nations, or the right to secede,as unnecessary to Eastern Europe and Asia? This would have been the height of absurdity, and (theoretically) tantamount to admitting that the bourgeois-democratic reform of theTurkish, Russian and Chinese states had been consummated;indeed it would have been tantamount (in practice) to op-portunism towards absolutism. 
 No. 
 At a time when bourgeois-democratic revolutions in Eastern Europe and Asia have begun, in this period of the awakening and intensification of national movements andof the formation of independent proletarian parties, thetask of these parties with regard to national policy must betwofold: recognition of the right of all nations to self-deter-mination, since bourgeois-democratic reform is not yet com-pleted and since working-class democracy consistently, serious-ly and sincerely (and not in a liberal, Kokoshkin fashion)fights for equal rights for nations; then, a close, unbreakablealliance in the class struggle of the proletarians of allnations in a given state, throughout all the changes in itshistory, irrespective of any reshaping of the frontiers of the individual states by the bourgeoisie. 
 It is this twofold task of the proletariat that the 1896 resolution of the International formulates. 
 That is the sub-stance, the underlying principle, of the resolution adoptedby the Conference of Russian Marxists held in the summer of1913. 
 Some people profess to see a “contradiction” in the fact that while point 4 of this resolution, which recognises the right to self-determination and secession, seems to “concede”the maximum to nationalism (in reality, the recognition ofthe right of all nations to self-determination implies the maximum of democracy and the minimum of nationalism), point 5 warns the workers against the nationalist slogans of the bourgeoisie of any nation and demands the unity and amalgamation of the workers of all nations in internationallyunited proletarian organisations. 
 But this is a “contradiction” only for extremely shallow minds, which, for instance, cannot grasp why the unity and class solidarity of the Swedish and the Norwegian proletariat gained when the Swedish workers upheld Norway’s freedom to secede and form an independent state. 
 8. 
 THE UTOPIAN KARL AND THE PRACTICAL ROSA LUXEMBURG Calling Polish independence a “utopia” and repeating this ad nauseam , Rosa Luxemburg exclaims ironically: Why not raise the demand for the independence of Ireland? The “practical” Rosa Luxemburg evidently does not know what Karl Marx’s attitude to the question of Irish independ-ence was. 
 It is worth while dwelling upon this, so as to show how a concrete demand for national independence was analysed from a genuinely Marxist, not opportunist, stand-point. 
 It was Marx’s custom to “sound out” his socialist ac-quaintances, as he expressed it, to test their intelligence and the strength of their convictions. 
” 189 After making the acquaintance of Lopatin, Marx wrote to Engels on July 5, 1870, expressing a highly flattering opinion of the youngRussian socialist but adding at the same time: “Poland is his weak point. 
 On this point he speaks quite like an Englishman—say, an English Chartist of the old school—about Ireland. 
 ” 190 Marx questions a socialist belonging to an oppressor na-tion about his attitude to the oppressed nation and at once reveals a defect common to the socialists of the dominant nations (the English and the Russian): failure to understandtheir socialist duties towards the downtrodden nations, their echoing of the prejudices acquired from the bourgeoisie of the “dominant nation”. 
 Before passing on to Marx’s positive declarations on Ire-land, we must point out that in general the attitude of Marxand Engels to the national question was strictly critical,and that they recognised its historically conditioned impor-tance. 
 Thus, Engels wrote to Marx on May 23, 1851, that the study of history was leading him to pessimistic conclu-sions in regard to Poland, that the importance of Poland was temporary—only until the agrarian revolution in Russia. 
 The role of the Poles in history was one of “bold (hotheaded) foolishness”. 
 “And one cannot point to a single instance in which Poland has successfully represented progress, evenin relation to Russia, or done anything at all of historicalimportance. 
” Russia contains more of civilisation, education,industry and the bourgeoisie than “the Poland of the indo-lent gentry”. 
 “What are Warsaw and Cracow compared to St. 
 Petersburg, Moscow, Odessa!” Engels had no faith in the success of the Polish gentry’s insurrections. 
 But all these thoughts, showing the deep insight of genius, by no means prevented Engels and Marx from treatingthe Polish movement with the most profound and ardentsympathy twelve years later, when Russia was still dormant and Poland was seething. 
 When drafting the Address of the International in 1864, Marx wrote to Engels (on November 4, 1864) that he had tocombat Mazzini’s nationalism, and went on to say: “Inas-much as international politics occurred in the Address,I spoke of countries, not of nationalities, and denounced Russia, not the minores gentium . 
” Marx had no doubt as to the subordinate position of the national question as com-pared with the “labour question”. 
 But his theory is as farfrom ignoring national movements as heaven is from earth. 
 Then came 1866. 
 Marx wrote to Engels about the “Prou-dhonist clique” in Paris which “declares nationalities to be an absurdity, attacks Bismarck and Garibaldi. 
 As polemics against chauvinism their doings are useful and explicable. 
But as believers in Proudhon (Lafargue and Longuet, twovery good friends of mine here, also belong to them), whothink all Europe must and will sit quietly on their hindquarters until the gentlemen in France abolish poverty and ignorance—they are grotesque. 
” (Letter of June 7, 1866. 
) “Yesterday,” Marx wrote on June 20, 1866, “there was a discussion in the International Council on the present war .... 
 The discussion wound up, as was to be foreseen, with ‘thequestion of nationality’ in general and the attitude we taketowards it .... 
 The representatives of ‘Young France’ ( non-workers ) came out with the announcement that all national ties and even nations were ‘antiquated prejudices’. 
Proudhonised Stirnerism .... 
 The whole world waits until the French are ripe for a social revolution .... 
 The English laughed very much when I began my speech by saying that our friend Lafargue and others, who had done away with nationalities, had spoken ‘French’ to us, i. 
e. 
, a languagewhich nine-tenths of the audience did not understand. 
I also suggested that by the negation of nationalities heappeared, quite unconsciously, to understand their absorp-tion by the model French nation. 
” The conclusion that follows from all these critical remarks of Marx’s is clear: the working class should be the lastto make a fetish of the national question, since the develop-ment of capitalism does not necessarily awaken all nations to independent life. 
 But to brush aside the mass nationalmovements once they have started, and to refuse to support what is progressive in them means, in effect, pandering to nationalistic prejudices, that is, recognising “one’s own na-tion” as a model nation (or, we would add, one possessingthe exclusive privilege of forming a state). 
 * But let us return to the question of Ireland. 
Marx’s position on this question is most clearly expressed in the following extracts from his letters: “I have done my best to bring about this demonstration of the English workers in favour of Fenianism .... 
 I used to think the separation of Ireland from England impossible. 
I now think it inevitable, although after the separation theremay come federation. 
” This is what Marx wrote to Engels on November 2, 1867. 
 In his letter of November 30 of the same year he added:“...what shall we advise the English workers? In my opinion they must make the Repeal of the Union ” [Ireland with England, i. 
e. 
, the separation of Ireland from England](in short, the affair of 1783, only democratised and adapted to the conditions of the time) an article of their pronunzia-mento . 
 This is the only legal and therefore only possible form of Irish emancipation which can be admitted in theprogramme of an English party. 
 Experience must show later *Cf. 
 also Marx’s letter to Engels of June 3, 1867: “...I have learned with real pleasure from the Paris letters to The Times about the pro-Polish exclamations of the Parisians against Russia .... 
 Mr. 
 P rou-dhon and his little doctrinaire clique are not the French people. 
” whether a mere personal union can continue to subsist be-tween the two countries.... 
 “...What the Irish need is: “1) Self-government and independence from England; “2) An agrarian revolution.... 
” Marx attached great importance to the Irish question and delivered hour-and-a-half lectures on this subjectat the German Workers’ Union (letter of December 17, 1867). 
 In a letter dated November 20, 1868, Engels spoke of “the hatred towards the Irish found among the English workers”,and almost a year later (October 24, 1869), returning tothis subject, he wrote: “Il n ’y a qu ’un pas [it is only one step] from Ireland to Russia .... 
 Irish hist ory shows what a misfortune it is for one nation to have subjugated another. 
 All the abominations ofthe English have their origin in the Irish Pale. 
 I have still toplough my way through the Cromwellian period, but thismuch seems certain to me, that things would have taken another turn in England, too, but for the necessity of military rule in Ireland and the creation of a new aristocracy there. 
” Let us note, in passing, Marx’s letter to Engels of August 18, 1869: “The Polish workers in Posen have brought a strike to a victorious end with the help of their colleagues in Berlin. 
 This struggle against Monsieur le Capital—even in the lower form of the strike—is a more serious way of getting rid ofnational prejudices than peace declamations from the lips ofbourgeois gentlemen. 
” The policy on the Irish question pursued by Marx in the International may be seen from the following: On November 18, 1869, Marx wrote to Engels that he had spoken for an hour and a quarter at the Council of the In-ternational on the question of the attitude of the BritishMinistry to the Irish Amnesty, and had proposed the follow-ing resolution: “Resolved, “that in his reply to the Irish demands for the release of the imprisoned Irish patriots Mr. 
 Gladstone deliberatelyinsults the Irish nation; “that he clogs political amnesty with conditions alike degrading to the victims of misgovernment and the people they belong to; “that having, in the teeth of his responsible position, publicly and enthusiastically cheered on the American slave-holders’ rebellion, he now steps in to preach to the Irishpeople the doctrine of passive obedience; “that his whole proceedings with reference to the Irish Amnesty question are the true and genuine offspring of that ‘policy of conquest ’, by the fiery denunciation of which Mr. 
 Gladstone ousted his Tory rivals from office; “that the General Council of the International Working-men’s Association express their admiration of the spirited,firm and high-souled manner in which the Irish people car-ry on their Amnesty movement; “that this resolution be communicated to all branches of, and workingmen’s bodies connected with, the InternationalWorkingmen’s Association in Europe and America. 
” On December 10, 1869, Marx wrote that his paper on the Irish question to be read at the Council of the International would be couched as follows: “Quite apart from all phrases about ‘international’ and ‘humane’ justice for Ireland—which are taken for grantedin the International Council— it is in the direct and absolute interest of the English working class to get rid of their presentconnexion with Ireland . 
 And this is my fullest conviction, and for reasons which in part I can not tell the English workers themselves. 
 For a long time I believed that it wouldbe possible to overthrow the Irish regime by English work-ing-class ascendancy. 
 I always expressed this point of viewin the New York Tribune 191 [an American paper to which Marx contributed for a long time]. 
 Deeper study has now convinced me of the opposite. 
 The English working class will never accomplish anything until it has got rid of Ire-land.... 
 The English reaction in England had its roots inthe subjugation of Ireland. 
” (Marx’s italics. 
) Marx’s policy on the Irish question should now be quite clear to our readers. 
 Marx, the “utopian”, was so “unpractical” that he stood for the separation of Ireland, which half a century later hasnot yet been achieved. 
 What gave rise to Marx’s policy, and was it not mistaken? At first Marx thought that Ireland would not be liberated by the national movement of the oppressed nation, but by the working-class movement of the oppressor nation. 
 Marx didnot make an Absolute of the national movement, knowing, ashe did, that only the victory of the working class can bringabout the complete liberation of all nationalities. 
 It isimpossible to estimate beforehand all the possible relations between the bourgeois liberation movements of the op-pressed nations and the proletarian emancipation movementof the oppressor nation (the very problem which today makesthe national question in Russia so difficult). 
 However, it so happened that the English working class fell under the influence of the liberals for a fairly long time, became an appendage to the liberals, and by adopting a liberal-labour policy left itself leaderless. 
 The bourgeoisliberation movement in Ireland grew stronger and assumedrevolutionary forms. 
 Marx reconsidered his view and correct-ed it. 
 “What a misfortune it is for a nation to have subjugat-ed another. 
” The English-working class will never be free until Ireland is freed from the English yoke. 
 Reaction in England is strengthened and fostered by the enslavementof Ireland (just as reaction in Russia is fostered by her enslave-ment of a number of nations!). 
 And, in proposing in the International a resolution of sympathy with “the Irish nation”, “the Irish people” (the clever L. 
 Vl. 
 would probably have berated poor Marx for forgetting about the class struggle!), Marx advocated theseparation of Ireland from England, “although after the separation there may come federation”. 
 What were the theoretical grounds for Marx’s conclusion? In England the bourgeois revolution had been consummated long ago. 
 But it had not yet been consummated in Ireland;it is being consummated only now, after the lapse of half a century, by the reforms of the English Liberals. 
 If capitalism had been overthrown in England as quickly as Marx had atfirst expected, there would have been no room for a bour-geois-democratic and general national movement in Ireland. 
 But since it had arisen, Marx advised the English workersto support it, give it a revolutionary impetus and see it through in the interests of their own liberty. 
 The economic ties between Ireland and England in the 1860s were, of course, even closer than Russia’s present ties with Poland, the Ukraine, etc. 
 The “unpracticality” and “im-practicability” of the separation of Ireland (if only owing togeographical conditions and England’s immense colonialpower) were quite obvious. 
 Though, in principle, an enemyof federalism, Marx in this instance granted the possibilityof federation, as well, * if only the emancipation of Ireland was achieved in a revolutionary, not reformist way, through a movement of the mass of the people of Ireland supportedby the working class of England. 
 There can be no doubt thatonly such a solution of the historical problem would havebeen in the best interests of the proletariat and most con-ducive to rapid social progress. 
 Things turned out differently. 
 Both the Irish people and the English proletariat proved weak. 
 Only now, through thesordid deals between the English Liberals and the Irish bour-geoisie, is the Irish problem being solved (the example of Ulster shows with what difficulty) through the land reform(with compensation) and Home Rule (not yet introduced). 
 Well then? Does it follow that Marx and Engels were “uto-pians”, that they put forward “impracticable” nationaldemands, or that they allowed themselves to be influencedby the Irish petty-bourgeois nationalists (for there is nodoubt about the petty-bourgeois nature of the Fenian move-ment), etc. 
? No. 
 In the Irish question, too, Marx and Engels pursued a consistently proletarian policy, which really educated themasses in a spirit of democracy and socialism. 
 Only such apolicy could have saved both Ireland and England half a *By the way, it is not difficult to see why, from a Social-Demo-cratic point of view, the right to “self-determination” means neither federation nor autonomy (although, speaking in the abstract, both come under the category of “self-determination”). 
 The right to federa-tion is simply meaningless, since federation implies a bilateral contract. 
 It goes without saying that Marxists cannot include the de-fence of federalism in general in their programme. 
 As far as auton-omy is concerned Marxists defend, not the “right” to autonomy, but autonomy itself , as a general universal principle of a democratic state with a mixed national composition, and a great variety of geo-graphical and other conditions. 
 Consequently, the recognition of the “right of nations to autonomy” is as absurd as that of the “right of nations to federation”. 
 century of delay in introducing the necessary reforms, and prevented these reforms from being mutilated by the Liberals to please the reactionaries. 
 The policy of Marx and Engels on the Irish question serves as a splendid example of the attitude the proletariat of theoppressor nations should adopt towards national movements,an example which has lost none of its immense practical importance. 
 It serves as a warning against that “servile haste” with which the philistines of all countries, colours and languages hurry to label as “utopian” the idea of altering thefrontiers of states that were established by the violence andprivileges of the landlords and bourgeoisie of one nation. 
 If the Irish and English proletariat had not accepted Marx’s policy and had not made the secession of Ireland their slo-gan, this would have been the worst sort of opportunism, a neglect of their duties as democrats and socialists, and aconcession to English reaction and the English bourgeoisie. 
 9. 
 THE 1903 PROGRAMME AND ITS LIQUIDATORS The Minutes of the 1903 Congress, at which the Programme of the Russian Marxists was adopted, have become a greatrarity, and the vast majority of the active members of theworking-class movement today are unacquainted with themotives underlying the various points (the more so sincenot all the literature relating to it enjoys the blessings of legality...). 
 It is therefore necessary to analyse the debate that took place at the 1903 Congress on the question underdiscussion. 
 Let us state first of all that however meagre the Russian Social-Democratic literature on the “right of nations toself-determination” may be, it nevertheless shows clearly that this right has always been understood to mean the right to secession. 
 The Semkovskys, Liebmans and Yurkevicheswho doubt this and declare that §9 is “vague”, etc. 
, do soonly because of their sheer ignorance or carelessness. 
 As farback as 1902, Plekhanov, in Zarya , defended “the right to self-determination” in the draft programme, and wrote that this demand, while not obligatory upon bourgeois democrats, was “obligatory upon Social-Democrats”. 
 “If we were to for-get it or hesitate to advance it,” Plekhanov wrote, “for fear of offending the national prejudices of our fellow-countrymen of Great-Russian nationality, the call ... ‘workers of all countries, unite!’ would be a shameful lie on our lips .... 
”192 This is a very apt description of the fundamental argu-ment in favour of the point under consideration; so apt that itis not surprising that the “anythingarian” critics of our pro-gramme have been timidly avoiding it. 
 The abandonment ofthis point, no matter for what motives, is actually a “shame-ful” concession to Great-Russian nationalism. 
 But why Great-Russian, when it is a question of the right of all nations to self-determination? Because it refers to secessionfrom the Great Russians. 
 The interests of the unity of the proletarians , the interests of their class solidarity call for rec-ognition of the right of nations to secede —that is what Ple-khanov admitted twelve years ago in the words quoted above. 
 Had our opportunists given thought to this they would prob-ably not have talked so much nonsense about self-determi-nation. 
 At the 1903 Congress, which adopted the draft programme that Plekhanov advocated, the main work was done by the Programme Commission . 
 Unfortunately no Minutes of its proceedings were kept; they would have been particularlyinteresting on this point, for it was only in the Commission that the representatives of the Polish Social-Democrats,Warszawski and Hanecki, tried to defend their views and todispute “recognition of the right to self-determination”. 
 Any reader who goes to the trouble of comparing their arguments (set forth in the speech by Warszawski and the statement byhim and Hanecki, pp. 
 134-36 and 388-90 of the Congress Min-utes) with those which Rosa Luxemburg advanced in herPolish article, which we have analysed, will find them iden-tical. 
 How were these arguments treated by the Programme Com-mission of the Second Congress, where Plekhanov, more thananyone else, spoke against the Polish Marxists? They weremercilessly ridiculed! The absurdity of proposing to theMarxists of Russia that they should reject the recognition of the right of nations to self-determination was demonstrat-ed so plainly and clearly that the Polish Marxists did not even venture to repeat their arguments at the plenary meet-ing of the Congress ! They left the Congress, convinced of the hopelessness of their case at the supreme assembly of Marx-ists—Great-Russian, Jewish, Georgian, and Armenian. 
 Needless to say, this historic episode is of very great importance to everyone seriously interested in his own programme. 
 The fact that the Polish Marxists’ argumentswere completely defeated at the Programme Commission ofthe Congress, and that the Polish Marxists gave up theattempt to defend their views at the plenary meeting of the Congress is very significant. 
 No wonder Rosa Luxemburg maintained a “modest” silence about it in her article in 1908—the recollection of the Congress must have been too unpleas-ant! She also kept quiet about the ridiculously inept propos-al made by Warszawski and Hanecki in 1903, on behalf ofall Polish Marxists, to “amend” §9 of the Programme, a proposal which neither Rosa Luxemburg nor the other Pol-ish Social-Democrats have ventured (or will ever venture)to repeat. 
 But although Rosa Luxemburg, concealing her defeat in 1903, has maintained silence over these facts, those who takean interest in the history of their Party will make it their business to ascertain them and give thought to their sig-nificance. 
 On leaving the 1903 Congress, Rosa Luxemburg’s friends submitted the following statement: “We propose that Clause 7 [now Clause 9] of the draft programme read as follows: §7. 
 Institutions guaranteeing full freedom of cultural development to all nations incorporated in the state . 
” (P. 
 390 of the Minutes. 
) Thus, the Polish Marxists at that time put forward views on the national question that were so vague that instead of self-determination they practically proposed the notorious“cultural-national autonomy”, only under another name! This sounds almost incredible, but unfortunately it is a fact. 
 At the Congress itself, attended though it was by fiveBundists with five votes and three Caucasians with sixvotes, without counting Kostrov’s consultative voice, not a single vote was cast for the rejection of the clause about self-determination. 
 Three votes were cast for the proposal to add “cultural-national autonomy” to this clause (in favour of Goldblatt’s formula: “the establishment of institutionsguaranteeing the nations full freedom of cultural develop-ment”) and four votes for Lieber’s formula (“the right of nations to freedom in their cultural development”). 
 Now that a Russian liberal party—the Constitutional-Democratic Party—has appeared on the scene, we know thatin its programme the political self-determination of nations has been replaced by “cultural self-determination”. 
 RosaLuxemburg’s Polish friends, therefore, were “ combating ” the nationalism of the P. 
S. 
P. 
, and did it so successfully that they proposed the substitution of a liberal programme for the Marxist programme! And in the same breath they accusedour programme of being opportunist; no wonder this accu-sation was received with laughter by the Programme Com-mission of the Second Congress! How was “self-determination” understood by the dele-gates to the Second Congress; of whom, as we have seen, not one was opposed to “self-determination of nations”? The following three extracts from the Minutes provide the answer: “Martynov is of the opinion that the term ‘self-determina-tion’ should not be given a broad interpretation; it merely means the right of a nation to establish itself as a separate polity, not regional self-government” (p. 
 171). 
 Martynov wasa member of the Programme Commission, in which the argu-ments of Rosa Luxemburg’s friends were repudiated and ridi-culed. 
 Martynov was then an Economist in his views, anda violent opponent of Iskra ; had he expressed an opinion that was not shared by the majority of the Programme Com-mission he would certainly have been repudiated. 
 Bundist Goldblatt was the first to speak when the Con-gress, after the Commission had finished its work, discussed§8 (the present Clause 9) of the Programme. 
 He said: “No objections can be raised to the ‘right to self-determination’. 
 When a nation is fighting for independence, that should not be op-posed. 
 If Poland refuses to enter into lawful marriage with Russia, she should not be interfered with, as Plekhanov put it. 
 I agree withthis opinion within these limits” (pp. 
 175-76). 
 Plekhanov had not spoken on this subject at all at the plenary meeting of the Congress. 
 Goldblatt was referring to what Plekhanov had said at the Programme Commission,where the “right to self-determination’’ had been explained in a simple yet detailed manner to mean the right to seces-sion. 
 Lieber, who spoke after Goldblatt, remarked: “Of course, if any nationality finds that it cannot live within the frontiers of Russia, the Party will not place any obstacles in Its way”(p. 
 176). 
 The reader will see that at the Second Congress of the Party, which adopted the programme, it was unanimously understood that self-determination meant “only” the right to secession. 
 Even the Bundists grasped this truth at thetime, and it is only in our own deplorable times of continuedcounter-revolution and all sorts of “apostasy” that we canfind people who, bold in their ignorance, declare that theprogramme is “vague”. 
 But before devoting time to these sorry would-be Social-Democrats, let us first finish with the attitude of the Poles to the programme. 
 They came to the Second Congress (1903) declaring that unity was necessary and imperative. 
 But they left the Con-gress after their “reverses” in the Programme Commission,and their last word was a written statement, printed in the Minutes of the Congress, containing the above-mentioned proposal to substitute cultural-national autonomy for self-determination. 
 In 1906 the Polish Marxists joined the Party; neither upon joining nor afterwards (at the Congress of 1907, the confer-ences of 1907 and 1908, or the plenum of 1910) did they in-troduce a single proposal to amend §9 of the Russian Pro-gramme! That is a fact. 
And, despite all utterances and assurances, this fact def-initely proves that Rosa Luxemburg’s friends regarded thequestion as having been settled by the debate at the Pro-gramme Commission of the Second Congress, as well as by the decision of that Congress, and that they tacitly acknowledged their mistake and corrected it by joining the Party in 1906,after they had left the Congress in 1903, without a singleattempt to raise the question of amending §9 of the Pro-gramme through Party channels. 
 Rosa Luxemburg’s article appeared over her signature in 1908—of course, it never entered anyone’s head to deny Party publicists the right to criticise the programme—and, since the writing of this article, not a single official body of the Polish Marxists has raised the question of revising §9. 
 Trotsky was therefore rendering a great disservice to certain admirers of Rosa Luxemburg when he wrote, onbehalf of the editors of Borba , in issue No. 
 2 of that publica-tion (March 1914): “The Polish Marxists consider that ‘the right to national self-determination’ is entirely devoid of political content and should bedeleted from the programme” (p. 
 25). 
 The obliging Trotsky is more dangerous than an enemy! Trotsky could produce no proof, except “private conversa-tions” (i. 
e. 
, simply gossip, on which Trotsky always sub-sists), for classifying “Polish Marxists” in general as sup-porters of every article by Rosa Luxemburg. 
 Trotsky present-ed the “Polish Marxists ” as people devoid of honour and conscience, incapable of respecting even their own convic-tions and the programme of their Party. 
 How obligingTrotsky is! When, in 1903, the representatives of the Polish Marxists walked out of the Second Congress over the right to self-de-termination, Trotsky could have said at the time that they regarded this right as devoid of content and subject to de-letion from the programme. 
 But after that the Polish Marxists joined the Party whose programme this was, and they have never introduced a motion to amend it. 
 * Why did Trotsky withhold these facts from the readers of his journal? Only because it pays him to speculate on foment-ing differences between the Polish and the Russian opponentsof liquidationism and to deceive the Russian workers on thequestion of the programme. 
 Trotsky has never yet held a firm opinion on any impor-tant question of Marxism. 
 He always contrives to worm his *We are informed that the Polish Marxists attended the Summer Conference of the Russian Marxists in 1913 with only a consultative voice and did not vote at all on the right to self-determination (se-cession), declaring their opposition to this right in general. 
 Of course,they had a perfect right to act the way they did, and, as hitherto,to agitate in Poland against secession. 
 But this is not quite whatTrotsky said; for the Polish Marxists did not demand the “deletion”of §9 from the programme”. 
 way into the cracks of any given difference of opinion and desert one side for the other. 
 At the present moment he is in the company of the Bundists and the liquidators. 
 And these gentlemen do not stand on ceremony where the Party is con-cerned. 
 Listen to the Bundist Liebman. 
 “When, fifteen years ago,” this gentleman writes, “the Russian Social-Democrats included the point about the right of every nation-ality to ‘self-determination’ in their programme, everyone [!] asked himself: What does this fashionable [!] term really mean? No answerwas forthcoming [!]. 
 This word was left [!] wrapped in mist. 
 Andindeed, at the time, it was difficult to dispel that mist. 
 The momenthad not come when this point could be made concrete—it was said—so let it remain wrapped in mist [!] for the time being and practice will show what content should be put into it. 
” Isn’t it magnificent, the way this “ragamuffin”193 mocks at the Party programme? And why does he mock at it? Because he is an absolute ignoramus, who has never learnt anything or even read any Party history, but merely happenedto land in liquidationist circles where going about in thenude is considered the “right” thing to do as far as knowledgeof the Party and everything it stands for is concerned. 
 Pomyalovsky’s seminary student boasts of having “spat into a barrel of sauerkraut”. 
 194 The Bundist gentlemen have gone one better. 
 They let the Liebmans loose to spit publiclyinto their own barrel. 
 What do the Liebmans care about thefact that the International Congress has passed a decision,that at the Congress of their own Party two representativesof their own Bund proved that they were quite able (and what “severe” critics and determined enemies of Iskra they were!) to understand the meaning of “self-determination”and were even in agreement with it? And will it not be easi-er to liquidate the Party if the “Party publicists” (no jokes,please!) treat its history and programme after the fashion ofthe seminary student? Here is a second “ragamuffin”, Mr. 
 Yurkevich of Dzvin . 
 Mr. 
 Yurkevich must have had the Minutes of the SecondCongress before him, because he quotes Plekhanov, as re-peated by Goldblatt, and shows that he is aware of the factthat self-determination can only mean the right to secession. 
This, however, does not prevent him from spreading slander about the Russian Marxists among the Ukrainian petty bourgeoisie, alleging that they stand for the “state integrity” of Russia. 
 (No. 
 7-8, 1913, p. 
 83, etc. 
) Of course, the Yur-keviches could not have invented a better method than suchslander to alienate the Ukrainian democrats from theGreat-Russian democrats. 
 And such alienation is in line with the entire policy of the group of Dzvin publicists who ad-vocate the separation of the Ukrainian workers in a special national organisation! * It is quite appropriate, of course, that a group of nation-alist philistines, who are engaged in splitting the ranks of the proletariat—and objectively this is the role of Dzvin — should disseminate such hopeless confusion on the national question. 
 Needless to say, the Yurkeviches and Liebmans, who are “terribly” offended when they are called “near-Party men”, do not say a word, not a single word, as to how they would like the problem of the right to secede to be settled in the programme. 
 But here is the third and principal “ragamuffin”, Mr. 
 Semkovsky, who, addressing a Great-Russian audiencethrough the columns of a liquidationist newspaper, lashes at§9 of the Programme and at the same time declares that “for certain reasons he does not approve of the proposal” to delete this clause! This is incredible, but it is a fact. 
In August 1912, the liquidators’ conference raised the national question officially. 
 For eighteen months nota single article has appeared on the question of §9, except the one written by Mr. 
 Semkovsky. 
 And in this article the author repudiates the programme, “without approving”, however, “for certain reasons” (is this a secrecy disease?) the proposal to amend it! We may be sure that it would bedifficult to find anywhere in the world similar examples ofopportunism, or even worse—renunciation of the Party, and a desire to liquidate it. 
 A single example will suffice to show what Semkovsky’s arguments are like: *See particularly Mr. 
 Yurkevich’s preface to Mr. 
 Levinsky’s book (written in Ukrainian) Outline of the Development of the Ukrain-ian Working-Class Movement in Galicia , Kiev, 1914. 
 “What are we to do,” he writes, “if the Polish proletariat wants to fight side by side with the proletariat of all Russia within theframework of a single state, while the reactionary classes of Polishsociety, on the contrary, want to separate Poland from Russia and obtain a majority of votes in favour of secession by referendum? Should we, Russian Social-Democrats in the central parliament, votetogether with our Polish comrades against secession, or—in order not to violate the ‘right to self-determination’—vote for secession?” (Novaya Rabochaya Gazeta No. 
 71. 
) From this it is evident that Mr. 
 Semkovsky does not even understand the point at issue ! It did not occur to him that the right to secession presupposes the settlement of the questionby a parliament (Diet, referendum, etc. 
) of the seceding re-gion, not by a central parliament. 
 The childish perplexity over the question “What are we to do”, if under democracy the majority are for reaction, serves to screen the real and live issue when both the Purish-keviches and the Kokoshkins consider the very idea of seces-sion criminal! Perhaps the proletarians of all Russia ought not to fight the Purishkeviches and the Kokoshkins today,but should by-pass them and fight the reactionary classes of Poland! Such is the sheer rubbish published in the liquidators’ organ of which Mr. 
 L. 
 Martov is one of the ideological lead-ers, the selfsame L. 
 Martov who drafted the programme andspoke in favour of its adoption in 1903, and even subsequent-ly wrote in favour of the right to secede. 
 Apparently L. 
 Martov is now arguing according to the rule: No clever man is needed there ; Better send Read , And I shall wait and see . 
 195 He sends Read-Semkovsky along and allows our pro-gramme to be distorted and endlessly muddled up in a daily paper whose new readers are unacquainted with it! Yes. 
 Liquidationism has gone a long way—there are even very many prominent ex-Social-Democrats who have not atrace of Party spirit left in them. 
 Rosa Luxemburg cannot, of course, be classed with the Liebmans, Yurkeviches and Semkovskys, but the fact that it was this kind of people who seized upon her error showswith particular clarity the opportunism she has lapsed into. 
 10. 
 CONCLUSION To sum up. 
 As far as the theory of Marxism in general is concerned, the question of the right to self-determination presents nodifficulty. 
 No one can seriously question the London resolu-tion of 1896, or the fact that self-determination implies onlythe right to secede, or that the formation of independentnational states is the tendency in all bourgeois-democratic revolutions. 
 A difficulty is to some extent created by the fact that in Russia the proletariat of both the oppressed and oppressornations are fighting, and must fight, side by side. 
 The taskis to preserve the unity of the proletariat’s class strugglefor socialism, and to resist all bourgeois and Black-Hundred nationalist influences. 
 Where the oppressed nations are con-cerned, the separate organisation of the proletariat as anindependent party sometimes leads to such a bitter struggleagainst local nationalism that the perspective becomesdistorted and the nationalism of the oppressor nation is lostsight of. 
 But this distortion of perspective cannot last long. 
 The experience of the joint struggle waged by the proletarians ofvarious nations has demonstrated all too clearly that we mustformulate political issues from the all-Russia, not the“Cracow” point of view. 
 And in all-Russia politics it isthe Purishkeviches and the Kokoshkins who are in the sad-dle. 
 Their ideas predominate, and their persecution of non-Russians for “separatism”, for thinking about secession, is being preached and practised in the Duma, in the schools,in the churches, in the barracks, and in hundreds and thou-sands of newspapers. 
 It is this Great-Russian nationalist poi-son that is polluting the entire all-Russia political atmos-phere. 
 This is the misfortune of one nation, which, by subju-gating other nations, is strengthening reaction throughoutRussia. 
 The memories of 1849 and 1863 form a living polit-ical tradition, which, unless great storms arise, threatens tohamper every democratic and especially every Social-Demo-cratic movement for decades to come. 
 There can be no doubt that however natural the point of view of certain Marxists belonging to the oppressed nations(whose “misfortune” is sometimes that the masses of the population are blinded by the idea of their “own” national liberation) may appear at times, in reality the objective alignment of class forces in Russia makes refusal to advocate the right to self-determination tantamount to the worstopportunism, to the infection of the proletariat with theideas of the Kokoshkins. 
 And these ideas are, essentially,the ideas and the policy of the Purishkeviches. 
 Therefore, although Rosa Luxemburg’s point of view could at first have been excused as being specifically Pol-ish, “Cracow” narrow-mindedness, * it is inexcusable today, when nationalism and, above all, governmental Great-Rus-sian nationalism, has everywhere gained ground, and whenpolicy is being shaped by this Great-Russian nationalism . 
 In actual fact, it is being seized upon by the opportunists of all nations, who fight shy of the idea of “storms” and “leaps”, believe that the bourgeois-democratic revolution is over,and follow in the wake of the liberalism of the Kokoshkins. 
 Like any other nationalism, Great-Russian nationalism passes through various phases, according to the classesthat are dominant in the bourgeois country at any given time. 
 Up to 1905, we almost exclusively knew national-reactionaries. 
 After the revolution, national-liberals arose in our country. 
 In our country this is virtually the stand adopted both by the Octobrists and by the Cadets (Kokoshkin), i. 
e. 
, bythe whole of the present-day bourgeoisie. 
 Great-Russian national-democrats will inevitably appear later on. 
 Mr. 
 Peshekhonov, one of the founders of the “Popu-lar Socialist” Party, already expressed this point of view(in the issue of Russkoye Bogatstvo for August 1906) when he called for caution in regard to the peasants’ nationalistprejudices. 
 However much others may slander us Bolshe-viks and accuse us of “idealising” the peasant, we always *It is not difficult to understand that the recognition by the Marxists of the whole of Russia , and first and foremost by the Great Russians, of the right of nations to secede in no way precludes agita-tion against secession by Marxists of a particular oppressed nation, just as the recognition of the right to divorce does not preclude agi-tation against divorce in a particular case. 
 We think, therefore, that there will be an inevitable increase in the number of Polish Marxistswho laugh at the non-existent “contradiction” now being “encouraged”by Semkovsky and Trotsky. 
 have made and always will make a clear distinction between peasant intelligence and peasant prejudice, between peasant strivings for democracy and opposition to Purishkevich, and the peasant desire to make peace with the priest and thelandlord. 
 Even now, and probably for a fairly long time to come, proletarian democracy must reckon with the nationalism ofthe Great-Russian peasants (not with the object of making concessions to it, but in order to combat it). 
 * The awaken-ing of nationalism among the oppressed nations, which be-came so pronounced after 1905 (let us recall, say, the groupof “Federalist-Autonomists” in the First Duma, the growthof the Ukrainian movement, of the Moslem movement,etc. 
), will inevitably lead to greater nationalism among the Great-Russian petty bourgeoisie in town and countryside. 
 The slower the democratisation of Russia, the more persist-ent, brutal and bitter will be the national persecution andbickering among the bourgeoisie of the various nations. 
The particularly reactionary nature of the Russian Purish-keviches will simultaneously give rise to (and strengthen) “separatist” tendencies among the various oppressed nation-alities, which sometimes enjoy far greater freedom inneighbouring states. 
 In this situation, the proletariat of Russia is faced with a twofold or, rather, a two-sided task: to combat nationalismof every kind, above all, Great-Russian nationalism; to recognise, not only fully equal rights for all nations in *It would be interesting to trace the changes that take place in Polish nationalism, for example, in the process of its transformationfrom gentry nationalism into bourgeois nationalism, and then intopeasant nationalism. 
 In his book Das polnische Gemeinwesen im preus-sischen Staat (The Polish Community in the Prussian State; there is a Russian translation), Ludwig Bernhard, who shares the view of a Ger-man Kokoshkin, describes a very typical phenomenon: the formation of a sort of “peasant republic” by the Poles in Germany in the formof a close alliance of the various co-operatives and other associationsof Polish peasants in their struggle for nationality, religion, and “Po-lish” land. 
 German oppression has welded the Poles together andsegregated them, after first awakening the nationalism of the gentry, then of the bourgeoisie, and finally of the peasant masses (especially after the campaign the Germans launched in 1873 against the use ofthe Polish language in schools). 
 Things are moving in the same di-rection in Russia, and not only with regard to Poland. 
 general, but also equality of rights as regards polity, i. 
e. 
, the right of nations to self-determination, to secession. 
 And at the same time, it is their task, in the interests of a suc-cessful struggle against all and every kind of nationalismamong all nations, to preserve the unity of the proletarianstruggle and the proletarian organisations, amalgamatingthese organisations into a close-knit international associa-tion, despite bourgeois strivings for national exclusiveness. 
 Complete equality of rights for all nations; the right of nations to self-determination; the unity of the workers ofall nations—such is the national programme that Marxism,the experience of the whole world, and the experience ofRussia, teach the workers. 
 This article had been set up when I received No. 
 3 of Nasha Rabochaya Gazeta , in which Mr. 
 Vl. 
 Kosovsky writes the following about the recognition of the right ofall nations to self-determination: “Taken mechanically from the resolution of the First Congress of the Party (1898), which in turn had borrowed it from the decisions of international socialist congresses, it was given, as is evident fromthe debate, the same meaning at the 1903 Congress as was ascribed toit by the Socialist International, i. 
e. 
, political self-determination,the self-determination of nations in the field of political independence. 
Thus the formula: national self-determination, which implies the right to territorial separation, does not in any way affect the question of how national relations within a given state organism should be regulated for nationalities that cannot or have no desire to leavethe existing state. 
” It is evident from this that Mr. 
 Vl. 
 Kosovsky has seen the Minutes of the Second Congress of 1903 and understands perfectly well the real (and only) meaning of the term self-determination. 
 Compare this with the fact that the edi-tors of the Bund newspaper Zeit let Mr. 
 Liebman loose to scoff at the programme and to declare that it is vague!Queer “party” ethics among these Bundists .... 
 The Lord alone knows why Kosovsky should declare that the Congress took over the principle of self-determination mechanically . 
 Some people want to “object”, but how, why, and for whatreason—they do not know. 
 THE BOURGEOIS INTELLIGENTSIA ’S METHODS OF STRUGGLE AGAINST THE WORKERS In all capitalist countries throughout the world, the bour-geoisie resorts to two methods in its struggle against theworking-class movement and the workers’ parties. 
 One method is that of violence, persecution, bans, and suppres-sion. 
 In its fundamentals, this is a feudal, medieval method. 
Everywhere there are sections and groups of the bourgeoi-sie—smaller in the advanced countries and larger in thebackward ones—which prefer these methods, and in certain,highly critical moments in the workers’ struggle against wage-slavery, the entire bourgeoisie is agreed on the employ-ment of such methods. 
 Historical examples of such momentsare provided by Chartism in England, and 1849 and 1871in France. 
 196 The other method the bourgeoisie employs against the movement is that of dividing the workers, disrupting their ranks, bribing individual representatives or certain groups of the proletariat with the object of winning them over toits side. 
 These are not feudal but purely bourgeois and mod-ern methods, in keeping with the developed and civilisedcustoms of capitalism, with the democratic system. 
 For the democratic system is a feature of bourgeois so-ciety, the most pure and perfect bourgeois feature, in which the utmost freedom, scope and clarity of the class struggleare combined with the utmost cunning, with ruses andsubterfuges aimed at spreading the “ideological” influence ofthe bourgeoisie among the wage-slaves with the object ofdiverting them from their struggle against wage-slavery. 
 In keeping with Russia’s boundless backwardness, the feudal methods of combating the working-class movementare appallingly predominant in that country. 
 After 1905, however, considerable “progress” was to be noted in the em-ployment of liberal and democratic methods to fool and cor-rupt the workers. 
 Among the liberal “methods” we have, for example, the growth of nationalism, a stronger tendency torefurbish and revive religion “for the people” (both directlyand indirectly in the form of developing idealistic, Kantianand Machist philosophy), the “successes” of bourgeois the-ories of political economy (combined with the labour theory of value, or substituted for it), etc. 
, etc. 
 Among the democratic methods of fooling the workers and subjecting them to bourgeois ideology are the liquidation-ist-Narodnik-Cadet varieties. 
 It is to these that we intendto draw our readers’ attention in the present article on cer-tain topical events that have occurred on the fringe of the working-class movement. 
 1. 
 THE LIQUIDATORS’ AND THE NARODNIKS’ ALLIANCE AGAINST THE WORKERS It is said that history is fond of irony, of playing tricks with people, and mystifying them. 
 In history this constantly happens to individuals, groups and trends that do not real-ise what they really stand for, i. 
e. 
, fail to understandwhich class they really (and not in their imagination) gravi-tate towards. 
 Whether this lack of understanding is genuineor hypocritical is a question that might interest the biog-rapher of a particular individual, but to the student of politics this question is of secondary importance, to say the least. 
 The important thing is how history and politics expose groups and trends and reveal the bourgeois nature concealedbehind their “pseudo-socialist” or “pseudo-Marxist” phraseol-ogy. 
 In the epoch of bourgeois-democratic revolutions, scores of groups and trends have everywhere, all over the world, imagined themselves to be “socialists” and have posed as such(see, for example, the schools listed by Marx and Engels inChapter III of the Communist Manifesto 197). 
 History has speedily exposed them in a matter of ten to twenty years, oreven less. 
 Russia is now passing through just such a phase. 
 It is over ten years since the Economists, then their successors the Mensheviks, and then the Mensheviks’ suc-cessors—the liquidators, began to fall away from the work-ing-class movement. 
 The Mensheviks were especially vociferous in their as-sertions that the Bolsheviks had drawn close to the Narod-niks.... 
 And now we have before us a very definite alliance be-tween the liquidators and the Narodniks directed againstthe working class and against the Bolsheviks, who have re-mained true to that class. 
 The alliance between the petty-bourgeois intelligentsia— liquidationist and Narodnik—against the workers has beendeveloping spontaneously. 
 At first it was stimulated by“practice ”. 
 No wonder people say that practice marches ahead of theory (especially in the case of those who are guid-ed by a false theory). 
 When the St. 
 Petersburg workers removed the liquidators from office, expelled these represen-tatives of bourgeois influence from the executives of thetrade unions and from their responsible positions on theInsurance Boards, the liquidators found themselves in alliance with the Narodniks. 
 “As soon as we came into the hall (where the election of the Insur-ance board was taking place),” a sincere and naïve Narodnik wrotein Stoikaya Mysl , issue No. 
 5, “the narrow and factional stand taken by the Pravdists at once became clear. 
 But we did not lose hope. 
Together with the liquidators, we drew up a non-factional electionlist giving one seat on the board and two alternate seats. 
” (SeePut Pravdy No. 
 38, March 16, 1914. 
) Poor liquidators, what a cruel trick history has played on them! How relentlessly has their new “friend and ally” the Left Narodnik, exposed them! The liquidators did not even manage to renounce their own very formal statements and resolutions of 1903 andother years, describing the Left Narodniks as bourgeoisdemocrats! History has swept away phrases, dispelled illusions and exposed the class nature of the groups. 
 Both the Narod-niks and the liquidators are groups of petty-bourgeoisintellectuals, whom the Marxist workers have removed fromthe movement, and who are trying to sneak in again underfalse pretences. 
 They are using the catchword “factionalism” as a cloak, a word that the notorious Akimov, the leader of the Econ-omists, used as a weapon against the Iskrists at the Second Party Congress in 1903. 
 Akimov’s catchword, that of anextreme opportunist, was the only weapon left to the liq-uidators and Narodniks: That rag of a Sovremennik seemed to have come into the world with the deliberate purpose ofshowing up to all literate people how rotten, useless and rusty that weapon was. 
 This Sovremennik is quite a startling event in our demo-cratic journalistic world. 
 Side by side with the names ofcasual contributors (need drives all sorts of people intostrange journals in order to earn a little money!), we find an obviously demonstrative combination of names intended to represent a combination of trends. 
 The liberal Bogucharsky; the Narodniks Sukhanov, Ra-kitnikov, B. 
 Voronov, V. 
 Chernov, and others; the liquidatorsDan, Martov, Trotsky and Sher (Potresov’s name was an-nounced in issue No. 
 66 of Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta next to that of Plekhanov, but for some reason it ... van-ished); the Machists Bazarov and Lunacharsky, and last, G. 
 V. 
 Plekhanov, the principal hero of Yedinstvo * (spelt both with a small and a capital letter)—such are the osten-tatious names that sparkle in the list of Sovremennik ’s contributors. 
 And fully in keeping with this, the highlight of the journal’s trend is the advocacy (by the Narodniks) of an alliance between the Narodniks and the “Marxists” (no joking!) . 
 The reader can judge what this advocacy is from the articles penned by Mr. 
 Sukhanov, the head of this journal. 
Here are some of the most important of this gentleman’s “ideas”. 
 “The old cleavage, at all events, has disappeared. 
 It is no longer possible to determine where Marxism ends and Narodism begins. 
Both Narodism and Marxism will be found on either side. 
 And bothsides are neither Marxist nor ‘Narodnik’. 
 Indeed, could it, and can it, be otherwise? Can any twentieth-century collectivist think in any but the Marxist way? And can any socialist in Russia be anythingbut a Narodnik?” “The same thing should be said about the present-day Marxist agrarian programme as we said last time about the Narodnik agrar-*See Note 153. 
— Ed. 
 ian programme: in its method of stating the case it is a Marxist pro-gramme, but in its practical aims it is a Narodnik programme. 
It appeals to the ‘historical course of things’ and it strives to embodythe slogan: land and freedom”. 
 (No. 
 7, pp. 
 75-76. 
) That will suffice, I think! This Mr. 
 Sukhanov publicly boasts that Plekhanov agrees with him. 
 But Plekhanov is silent! But let us examine Mr. 
 Sukhanov’s line of argument. 
 This new ally of Plekhanov and the liquidators has “liq-uidated” the difference between Marxism and Narodismon the ground that, as he claims, the practical aims of bothtrends embody the slogan: land and freedom. 
 This, wholly and literally, is an argument in defence of “unity ” between the workers and the bourgeoisie. 
 We might say, for example, that “in their practical aims” both the work-ing class and the liberal bourgeoisie “strive to embody”the slogan of a constitution. 
 From this, the clever Mr. 
 Su-khanov should draw the conclusion that the cleavage intoproletariat and bourgeoisie has been “liquidated” and thatit is “impossible to determine where” proletarian democracy “ends” and bourgeois democracy begins. 
 Take the text of the Marxist agrarian programme. 
 Sukha-nov behaves like all liberal bourgeois who pick out a “prac-tical” slogan (“Constitution”!) and declare that the differ-ence between the socialist and the bourgeois world outlookis a matter of “abstract theory”! But we take the liberty of believing that the meaning and significance of practical slogans, the interests of which class these slogans serve,and how they serve them, are matters to which class-conscious workers and all those who take an intelligent in-terest in politics cannot remain indifferent. 
 We turn to the Marxist agrarian programme (which Mr. 
 Sukhanov referred to in order to distort it out of all recog-nition) and at once find, next to practical points that are objects of controversy among Marxists (for example, munic-ipalisation), other points that are indisputable . 
 “With a view to eliminating survivals of the serf system, which are a direct and heavy burden upon the peasants, and in order to facilitate the free development of the classstruggle in the rural districts” ... this is how the Marx-ist agrarian programme begins. 
 To Mr. 
 Sukhanov this is unimportant “abstract theory”! Whether we want a con-stitution to facilitate the free development of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie or to facilitate “social conciliation” between the workersand the capitalists is a matter of no importance; that is“abstract theory”. 
 That is what all bourgeois would haveus believe. 
 The bourgeois correctly expresses his class interests when he tries to persuade the workers of this. 
 Mr. 
 Sukhanov be-haves entirely like a bourgeois when he relegates to the background the question as to what we need agrarian reforms for—for the purpose of facilitating the free development of the class struggle between the wage-workers and theirmasters, big and small, or for the purpose of facilitating “social conciliation” between them with the aid of bourgeois catchwords like “labour” economy? A little further on we read in the Marxist agrarian pro-gramme that Marxists ... “will always and invariably opposeevery attempt to check the economic progress”. 
 As is known,that is the very reason why Marxists declare that every at-tempt, however slight, to restrict the freedom of mobilisa-tion (the buying, selling, mortgaging, etc. 
) of peasant land isa reactionary measure harmful to the workers and to social development as a whole. 
 The Narodniks—from the “Social-Cadet” Peshekhonov to the Left Narodniks of Smelaya Mysl —stand for restricting the freedom of mobilisation in one way or another. 
 The Narodniks are the worst kind of reactionaries on this ques-tion, the Marxists say. 
 Mr. 
 Sukhanov evades this point! He is reluctant to recall that it was this that made Plekhanov call the Narodniks“socialist-reactionaries”. 
 Mr. 
 Sukhanov brushes “abstract theory” aside on the plea that he stands for “practice”, and he brushes aside “practice” (freedom to mobilise peasant land)on the general plea that he stands for the slogan of “land andfreedom”. 
 The conclusion to be drawn is clear: Mr. 
 Sukhanov is nothing more nor less than a bourgeois who is trying to ob-scure the class strife between workers and masters. 
 And it is these bourgeois that the Marxist agrarian pro-gramme refers to when it says: “In all cases and in every situation connected with dem-ocratic agrarian reform” (note: under all circumstances and in every situation, i. 
e. 
, municipalisation, division, or any other likely form) ... Marxists “make it their object towork steadily towards an independent class organisation ofthe rural proletariat, to explain to it the irreconcilable antagonism between its interests and those of the peasantbourgeoisie, to warn it against being beguiled by the petty farming system , which will never , as long as commodity pro-duction exists, be able to abolish poverty among the masses,” etc. 
 That is what the Marxist agrarian programme says. 
 That is exactly what is said in that point of the programmewhich the Mensheviks accepted from the Bolsheviks ’ draft at the Stockholm Congress, i. 
e. 
, the point that is least disputed and most generally recognised among Marx-ists. 
 That is what it says in the most important point on the question of Narodism, which deals with the “ small farming system”. 
 But Mr. 
 Sukhanov passes this question over in complete silence ! Mr. 
 Sukhanov has done away with the “old cleavage”, with the division of trends into Marxism and Narodism, by ignoring the clear and definite wording of the “Marxist agrarian programme” aimed against Narodism! Without doubt, Mr. 
 Sukhanov is a mere windbag—many of his kind haunt the drawing-rooms of our liberal “society”—who has no idea of Marxism, and airily “does away” withthis unimportant socialist division into Marxism and Na-rodism. 
 As a matter of fact, Marxism and Narodism are poles apart, both in theory and in practice. 
 Marx’s theory is that of the development of capitalism and of the classstruggle between the wage-workers and the master class. 
The theory of Narodism is the theory of the bourgeois white-washing of capitalism with the aid of catchwords like“labour economy”; it is a theory which plays down, obscures and hinders the class struggle by means of these very same catchwords, by advocating restriction of the mobilisationof the land, and so forth. 
 Historically, the depth of the gulf between Marxism and Narodism in Russia was revealed by practice —not of slo-gans, of course, for only brainless people can regard “slo-gans” as “practice”—but by the practice of the open and mass struggle of millions in 1905-07. 
 This practice showed that Marxism had merged with the working-class movementand that Narodism had merged (or had begun to merge) withthe movement of the petty-bourgeois peasantry (the Peasant Union, 198 the First and Second Duma elections, the peasant movement, and so forth). 
 Narodism stands for bourgeois democracy in Russia. 
This was proved by the half a century of evolution of this trend and by the open struggles of the millions in 1905-07. 
This was recognised repeatedly in the most emphatic and official manner by the supreme bodies of the “Marxist whole” from 1903 to 1907, and down to the Summer Conferenceof 1913. 
 The publicists’ alliance that we see today among the leaders of Narodism (Chernov, Rakitnikov and Sukhanov) and various Social-Democratic intellectualist factions that are either openly opposed to the “underground”, i. 
e. 
, the workers’ party (the liquidators * Dan, Martov and Chere-vanin) or else help these liquidationist workerless groups (Trotsky and Sher, Bazarov, Lunacharsky and Plekhanov),is in fact nothing more nor less than an alliance of bourgeois intellectuals directed against the workers. 
 We regard Pravdism as the expression of the workers’ unity on the basis of genuine recognition of the “under-ground” and of definite decisions that co-ordinate and guidetactics in the old spirit (the decisions of January 1912 andof February and the summer of 1913). 
 It is a fact that be-tween January 1, 1912 and May 13, 1914, Pravdism united 5,674 workers’ groups as against 1,421 united by the liqui-dators, and none, or almost none, by the Vperyod , Plekhanov, Trotsky and Sher, and other groups. 
 (See Rabochy No. 
 1, “From the History of the Workers’ Press in Russia”, p. 
 19and Trudovaya Pravda No. 
 2, of May 30, 1914. 
 **) *How zealously Mr. 
 Voronov defends the liquidators in Sovre-mennik ! **See pp. 
 319-21 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 It is a fact that this workers’ unity is built on the firm basis of integral, complete and, in principle, consistent decisions on all questions affecting the lives of the Marxist workers. 
 Here you have a whole , for four-fifths have an absolute right to represent, to act and speak on behalf ofthe “whole ”. 
 But the Sovremennik alliance of the leaders of Narodism and all sorts of Social-Democratic workerless groups (with-out definite tactics, without definite decisions, knowing only vacillations between the trend and the united body ofPravdism on the one hand, and the liquidators on the other)—this alliance sprang up spontaneously . 
 Not one of the “Social-Democratic workerless groups” dared to come outin favour of such an alliance straightforwardly, clearly and openly—because the Summer Conference of 1913 expressed opposition to an alliance with the Narodniks! Not one ofthese groups, neither the liquidators, the Vperyod people, nor Plekhanov and Co. 
, and Trotsky and Co. 
, dared do this!All of them simply swam with the stream, carried along bytheir opposition to Pravdism and a desire to break or weaken it, and instinctively seeking assistance one from another against the four-fifths of the workers—the liquidators from Sukhanov and Chernov, Sukhanov and Chernov from Ple-khanov, Plekhanov from these two, Trotsky also from them,and so forth. 
 None of these groups displays anything like auniform policy, tactics that can be called at all definite, or a frank declaration to the workers in defence of its alliance with the Narodniks. 
 It is a most unprincipled alliance of bourgeois intellectuals against the workers. 
 Plekhanov is to be pitied for the disrep-utable company he finds himself in, but let us face the truthsquarely. 
 People can call the alliasnce of these groups “unity” if they wish to, but we call it a breakaway from the working-class whole, and the facts prove that our view is correct. 
 2. 
 HOW THE LIBERALS DEFEND “UNITY” BETWEEN THE WORKERS AND THE LIQUIDATORS The arrival in Russia of Emile Vandervelde, the Chairman of the International Socialist Bureau, naturally gave afillip to the discussion of the question of unity. 
 E. 
 Vander-velde’s immediate mission was to collect information on this question, explore the ground and take all possible steps to promote unity. 
 We know from press reports that he visited the editorial offices of both newspapers, the Marxistand liquidationist, and exchanged opinions with repre-sentatives of both these newspapers at a “banquet”. 
 Soon after Vandervelde returned to Brussels, an inter-view with the Chairman of the International Socialist Bu-reau appeared in the two principal French socialist dailies, the Paris Humanit é 199 and the Brussels Peuple in their issues of Sunday, June 21, new style. 
 In this interview the differ-ences among the Russian Social-Democrats were inaccu-rately formulated by Vandervelde. 
 Some of them, he said,“want to organise legally and demand the right of association, while others want to secure the immediate proclamation ... of the ‘pillar’ * ... and the expropriation of the land. 
” Van-dervelde called this difference “rather childish”. 
 We shall scarcely be wrong in assuming that this comment of Vandervelde’s will evoke a “rather good-natured” smilefrom class-conscious workers in Russia who read it. 
 If “some” “want to organise legally”, that is, if they stand for an open, legal party, then it is obvious that others challengethis point , not by referring to the “pillar” or “pillars”, but by defending the “underground” and categorically refusingto take part in the “struggle for a legal party”. 
 A differenceof this kind is one that affects the Party’s very existence and—our highly esteemed comrade E. 
 Vandervelde will forgive our saying so—there can be no “conciliation” here. 
It is impossible partly to abolish the “underground” andpartly to substitute a legal party for it .... 
 But Vandervelde did not only question people about the differences. 
 On this matter both the Chairman and the Sec-retary of the International Socialist Bureau have collected in their briefcases a mass of documents, reports and lettersfrom representatives of all and sundry, from real and fromfictitious “leading bodies”. 
 Vandervelde evidently decided totake advantage of his visit to St. 
 Petersburg to collect cer-tain factual data on the degree to which the different social-ist (and “pseudo-socialist ”) trends and groups in Russia *I. 
e. 
, a democratic republic. 
— Ed. 
 exercise mass influence. 
 Vandervelde is a man with no little political experience, and of course he knows perfectly well that in politics in general and in the working-class movement in particular only those trends which exercise mass influencecan be taken seriously. 
 On this question we find the following statement by Van-dervelde in the two French socialist newspapers mentionedabove: “The socialists in Russia have three daily newspa-pers. 
 The revolutionaries [evidently this refers to the Left Narodniks] publish newspapers with a circulation of 10,000to 12,000; the Leninists have a circulation of 35,000 to 40,000and the moderates [ moderés —evidently this refers to the liquidators] about 16,000. 
” Here E. 
 Vandervelde is slightly in error. 
 As is well known, the Left-Narodnik newspaper is not a daily; it comes out three times a week. 
 Moreover, according to our information,he has understated the maximum circulation of the Prav-dist newspaper; it has reached 48,000. 
 It would be desir-able for exact information on this question (so importantfor a study of the working-class movement) to be collected for a whole month for example, if it is impossible to collect it for a year. 
 But what a great difference there is between Vandervelde, the true European, who attaches no importance to Asiaticgullibility or rule-of-thumb methods but collects the facts , and the Russian, liquidationist and liberal-bourgeois wind-bags, who pose as “Europeans”! For example, in an article published in the newspaper Rech and entitled “E. 
 Vander-velde and the Russian Socialists” (No. 
 152, of June 7 [20],the day before the interview with Vandervelde appeared inParis and Brussels), the official representatives of the Cadetswrote the following: “When, at a dinner-party, one of the Bolsheviks assured Vander-velde that they had no one to unite with, as ‘in the workshops, among the working class, all were already united around the single Prav-dist banner, except for a mere handful of intellectuals’, he of course,was guilty of an exaggerated polemical overstatement. 
” This is a sample of a liquidationist and liberal lie clothed in glib and polished phrases. 
 “An exaggerated polemical overstatement!” As if there are overstatements which are not exaggerations .... 
 The official Cadets not only write in an illiterate manner, but also deliberately deceive their readers. 
 If the Bolsheviks were guilty of “a polemical overstatement” why don’t you, Cadet gentlemen—since you have raised this question in thepress—quote facts that are not an overstatement and not polemical? During the three or four days he spent in Russia, E. 
 Van-dervelde, who does not know Russian, managed to collect objective data. 
 But the St. 
 Petersburg Cadets, just like the St. 
 Petersburg liquidators, * have never published any objective data in their newspapers, and groundlessly andhypocritically accuse the Pravdists of “overstatement ”! Let us take Vandervelde’s data. 
 According to these, the weekly circulation of the Marxist, liquidationist and Narod-nik newspapers respectively is as follows: per per cent cent Marxist newspaper .... 
 240,000 64. 
5 71. 
4100%Liquidationist ...... 96,000 25. 
8 28. 
6 Narodnik ....... 
. 
 36,000 9. 
7 Total .... 
 372,000 100. 
0 These are the objective data collected by the Chairman of the International Socialist Bureau. 
 Even if we includethe Narodniks, with whom only the liquidators, Machists and Plekhanov wish to “unite” but are afraid to say so openly, the Pravdists still have a majority of nearly two-thirds. 
 Without counting the Narodniks, the Pravdists have amajority of 71. 
4 per cent, i. 
e. 
, more than seven-tenths , over the liquidators! But the newspapers are read and maintained not only by workers. 
 The objective data on collections published in both the Marxist and liquidationist newspapers have shown that (between January 1 and May 13, 1914) the Pravdistshad 80 per cent of the workers’ groups, the St. 
 Petersburgpercentage being as high as 86. 
 Of the sum of 21,000 rublescollected by the Pravdists, over eight-tenths was fromworkers, whereas with the liquidators, more than half the *The liberal Kievskaya Mysl , for which a large number of liqui-dators write, published the interview with Vandervelde from Le Peuple , but omitted the circulation figures! ( Kievskaya Mysl No. 
 159. 
){ donations came from the bourgeoisie . 
* Hence, it has been fully and definitely proved that the circulation figures understate the predominance of the Pravdists, since the liquidationist newspaper is maintained by the bourgeoisie. 
 And the no less objective returns of the Insurance Boardelections show that during the election of the All-RussiaInsurance Board the Bolsheviks had 47 delegates out of 57,i. 
e. 
, 82. 
4 per cent. 
 In spreading among the masses, through the medium of their press, the accusation that the Pravdists “overstate”(and even “exaggeratedly overstate”), without quoting anyobjective data either on the circulation of the newspapers,or on the workers’ groups, or on the Insurance Board elec-tions, the Cadets are deliberately lying, and elevating the liquidators . 
 The class interests of Russia’s liberal bourgeoisie compel it of course to defend the liquidators, whom the Marxistsunanimously regard (the decision of 1910) as “ vehicles of bourgeois influence on the proletariat ”. 
 But when, at the same time, the liberals try to pose as “impartial” people, their lie becomes particularly hypocritical and disgusting. 
 The Cadets’ utterances have one and only one political purpose, viz. 
, to use the liquidators as vehicles of bourgeoisinfluence on the workers. 
 “There is no doubt,” Rech continues, “that genuine [!] working-class intellectuals, those workers who bore the brunt of Social-Demo-cratic [! as appraised by the Cadets, who are experts in Social-Democ-racy] work in the most trying years, sympathise, not with the Bol-sheviks, but with their opponents [the liquidators and Mensheviks]. 
To dissever these elements from the Russian workers’ party would so impoverish it intellectually that the Bolsheviks themselves would stand aghast at their own handiwork. 
” This is what the Cadets write in a Rech editorial article. 
 And here, for comparison, is what L. 
 M. 
, the liquidators’ ideological leader, wrote in issue No. 
 3 of Nasha Zarya (1914, p. 
 68). 
 “This is a revolt [of the Pravdist workers] against the Dementievs, Gvozdevs, Chirkins, Romanovs, Bulkins, Kabtsans and the rest, as *See the article “The Working Class and Its Press” in Trudovaya Pravda , June 14. 
 (See pp. 
 363-71 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
) representatives of a whole—and, in the capitals, fairly large—section of the Marxist workers, who have been trying to ‘liquidate’ thechildishly romantic stage of the Russian working-class movement. 
 As you see, the similarity is complete. 
 In Rech editorial articles the Cadets fully repeat in their own name the refrainthat L. 
 M. 
 sings in Nasha Zarya . 
 The limited circulations of Nasha Zarya and Nasha Likvidatorskaya Gazeta are supplemented by the Cadet newspapers, which vouch for the Social-Democracy of Bulkin, Chirkin and Co. 
 Mr. 
 L. 
 M. 
 gives the names of a handful of liquidationist workers. 
 We willingly repeat these names. 
 All class-con-scious workers in Russia will at once recognise these liberal workers , who have long been known for the struggle they have been waging against the “underground”, i. 
e. 
, against the Party. 
 Read what Bulkin wrote in this very same Nasha Zarya alongside of L. 
 M. 
 and you will see that both repu-diate the “underground” and, to the delight of the liberals,abuse it. 
 And so we shall place on record and take cognisance of the fact that the “Dementievs, Gvozdevs, Chirkins, Roma-novs, Bulkins and Kabtsans”, whom Mr. 
 L. 
 M. 
 mentions, are, as the Cadets assure us , “genuine working-class intellectuals”. 
 They are indeed genuine liberal workers! This is fully borneout by Bulkin’s article. 
 We strongly advise class-consciousworkers not yet familiar with the utterances of the above-mentioned liberal proletarians to read it. 
 The liberal Rech tries to scare us with the prospect of the “disseverance from the workers’ party” of these (as Rech assures us) Social-Democrats, of these Social-Democratswhom Rech eulogises. 
 But we shall reply merely with a smile, for it is common knowledge that this handful of men have cut themselves off by going over to the liberal-liquidators, and that this “dis-severance” served as a guarantee and foundation for the for-mation of a genuine workers ’ (not liberal-labour) party. 
 In the same editorial article Rech praises the “ civic courage of the calm and sometimes damping utterances ” of the liqui-dators and liberal workers. 
 Trust Rech and the liberals to praise them! The liberals in Russia, particularly after 1905, can exert no direct influence on the workers. 
 They cannothelp appreciating the liquidators, who under the guise of Social-Democracy carry on the same liberal “damping” work and act as vehicles for this same “bourgeois influence on the proletariat” (see decision of 1910!). 
 “The differences between them [the Social-Democratic groups] will not be soon removed,” Rech writes, “but while preserving their specific features they must unite, not carry their strife into the ranksof the workers, who are only just awakening to conscious politicallife. 
 The split among the workers is a matter of great rejoicing to the reactionaries. 
 This alone is enough to make honest people in both groups strive sincerely and seriously for unity. 
” This is what Rech writes. 
 We are very glad not to belong to the liberal company of “honest” people and to those they regard as “honest”. 
 Wewould consider it a dishonour to belong to such people. 
 We are convinced that only utterly naïve or foolish people can believe in the “impartiality” of the liberal bourgeois, espe-cially where the working-class movement for emancipation,i. 
e. 
, its movement against the bourgeoisie, is concerned. 
 The Cadets are mistaken in thinking that the Russian workers are childishly naïve, or that they are capable of believing the liberal bourgeoisie’s “impartial” appraisal of “honesty”. 
 The liberal bourgeois regards the liquidators andtheir advocates as “honest” men because , and only because , liquidationism renders a political service to the bourgeoisieas a vehicle of bourgeois influence on the proletariat. 
 Accepting full responsibility for their acts, the united Marxists of Russia declared straightforwardly, openly and before all the workers of Russia, that a definite group ofliquidators, the Nasha Zarya and Luch group, etc. 
, stood beyond the pale of the Party . 
 This declaration was made in January 1912. 
 Since then, in the course of two-and-a-halfyears, 5,674 workers’ groups, as against 1,421 groups for the liquidators and all their supporters, i. 
e. 
, four-fifths of the class-conscious workers of Russia, have aligned them-selves with Pravdism, i. 
e. 
, approved of the January decision. 
 The liquidators acted in such a way that the workers moved away from them. 
 Our decision has been confirmed by events and by the experience of the vast majority of the workers. 
 It is in their own selfish class interests that the liberals advocate “unity” (between the workers and the liquidators). 
 Only the liquidators’ breakaway from the workers’ party enabled the latter to weather the hard times with honour — we attach to this word a different meaning from what you Rech gentlemen do! The separation of the liquidators from the workers’ party gave the reactionaries cause, notfor “rejoicing” but for sorrow , since the liquidators stood in the way of recognition of the old forms, the old “hierarchy”,the old decisions, etc. 
, and they themselves, for two-and-a-half years, proved absolutely incapable of forming any kind of organisation whatsoever. 
 The “August” (1912) blocof the liquidators and their friends collapsed. 
 It was only despite the liquidators, only without them and against them, that the workers were able to conduct that brilliant campaign of strikes, insurance elections and the establishment of newspapers which everywhere resulted in a four-fifths majority for the opponents of liquidation-ism. 
 By a “split” the liberals understand the removal from the workers’ ranks of the opponents of the “underground”, a hand-ful of liquidationist intellectuals. 
 By “unity” they under-stand the maintenance of liquidationist influence over the workers. 
 We regard the matter differently. 
 By “unity” we mean the fact of four-fifths of the workers having rallied around the oldbanner. 
 By a split we mean the refusal of the liquidationistgroup to accept and bow to the will of the majority of the workers, thus flouting that will. 
 Convinced by experience that during two-and-a-half years Pravdism has ralliedfour-fifths of the workers, we consider it necessary to advancetowards still greater unity along the same path —from four-fifths to nine-tenths, and then to ten-tenths of the workers. 
 The difference in the positions and points of view of the proletariat and of the bourgeoisie gives rise to two opposite views regarding the liquidators—our view and that of theliberals. 
 How is Plekhanov’s position to be explained? In 1908 he broke with the liquidators so emphatically, and at one timeupheld, in the press, the Party’s decisions in opposition to the liquidators with such firmness, that some people hoped that his vacillations had come to an end. 
 Now, when four-fifths of the workers have rallied around Pravdism, Ple-khanov is beginning to vacillate again. 
 The only possible explanation of his “position”, which, in effect, now fully coincides with that of the liberal Rech , is that it is due to his personal vacillations—a disease he contracted in 1903. 
 Like Rech , Plekhanov interprets “unity” to mean ensuring the liquidators’ influence over the workers in defiance of thewill of the workers, in defiance of the Party’s decisions, inspite of the liquidators’ flouting of these decisions. 
 Yesterday Plekhanov compared Mr. 
 Potresov with Judas, and quite rightly stated that the apostles were stronger without Judas than with him. 
 Today, however, when the facts have definite-ly proved that the liquidators are entirely at one withPotresov and that they flout the Party’s decisions, Plekha-nov turns towards the liquidators and advises the Pravdists not to talk to them in the “language of conquerors”! In other words, to put it more bluntly, the majority of the workersshould refrain from demanding that their will be recognised and their decisions respected by the minority, which followsthe lead of those who are deliberately violating the Party’sdecisions! The class-conscious workers will have to sadly admit that Plekhanov is suffering from another attack of the politicaldisease of wavering and vacillation which he contracted tenyears ago ... and will ignore him. 
 There is, however, another explanation of Plekhanov’s vacillations, an explanation to which we give second placebecause it does Plekhanov even less credit. 
 Groups of vacil-lating intellectuals inevitably spring up between the con-tending trends —the liquidationist (which draws its social strength from the sympathy of the liberal bourgeoisie) and the Pravdist (which draws its strength from the class-con-sciousness and solidarity of the majority of the workers inRussia, who are awakening from their darkness and are seeingthe light). 
 These groups have no social force behind them, andcan have no mass influence on the workers, because politi-cally they are mere cyphers. 
 Instead of a firm, clear line which attracts the workers and is confirmed by living experience, narrow circle diplomacy reigns in such groups. 
 The absence of contact with the masses, the absence of historical roots in the mass trends of Social-Democracy in Russia (Social-De-mocracy became a mass movement in Russia with the strikes of 1895), and the absence of a consistent, integral, clear and absolutely definite line tested by many years of experience,i. 
e. 
, lack of answers to the questions of tactics, organisationand programme—such is the soil on which narrow circlediplomacy thrives, and such are its symptoms. 
 Plekhanov’s newspaper Yedinstvo , as a political body, reveals all these symptoms (like Trotsky’s Borba . 
 Inciden-tally, let the reader ponder over the reasons for the disunity between these alleged “uniters”, Borba and Yedinstvo ...). 
 Deputy Buryanov, like every deputy who is comparatively“long-lived” among the very short-lived politicians in Rus-sia, was for a long time a liquidator, but has now “vacillat-ed” towards Plekhanov. 
 Whither he has vacillated and for how long, he does not himself know. 
 But for narrow circlediplomacy there is, of course, no greater stroke of luck thanthe acquisition of such a “vacillating” deputy, who aspiresto “unity” between the Six who want to help the liquidatorsof the Party flout the will of the majority of the workers, and the Six who want to give effect to that will. 
 Imagine “unity” between the two Sixes independently of the will of the majority of the workers. 
 You will say thatit is unimaginable and monstrous, because deputies shouldperform the will of the majority! But what the proletariatregards as monstrous the liberals regard as a virtue, a boon, a blessing, honesty, and probably, even something sacred. 
 (Struve, in Russkaya Mysl , will certainly argue tomorrow, and he will be supported in this by Berdayev, Izgoyev,Merezhkovsky and Co. 
, that the Leninists are sinful “split-ters”, while the liquidators and Plekhanov, who is todaydefending them from the “conqueror” workers, are holy instruments of the will of God. 
) Accept for a moment this (in effect liberal) point of view of “unity” between the two Duma Sixes independently of the will of the majority of the workers. 
 You will at oncerealise that it is in the narrow circle interests of Buryanovand the group of publicists who write for Yedinstvo to play upon the differences between the two Sixes, and use their differences in order to act the perpetual role of the “con-ciliator”! Such a conciliator, be it Buryanov, Trotsky, Plekhanov, Sher, Chernov, Sukhanov, or anybody else, may say: On the one hand, the liquidationist Six are wrong, for they are liquidating the Party’s decisions. 
 On the other hand, thePravdist Six are wrong, because they talk to their col-leagues in the unbecoming, improper, and sinful “languageof conquerors”, claiming to do so on behalf of an allegedmajority. 
 Such a “conciliator” may even go to the length of calling this eclectic and intriguer’s conduct “dialectical” and lay claim to the title of “uniter” .... 
 After all, there have been cases like this in our Party. 
 Recall, for example, thepart played by the Bundists and Tyszka at the Stockholmand London congresses, and in the period of 1906-11 ingeneral. 
 Those were happy days for the narrow circle diplomats and sad ones for the workers’ party, days when the class-conscious workers had not yet rallied closely enough againstthose vehicles of bourgeois influence, the Economists andMensheviks. 
 Those days are now passing. 
 Rech , the Cadet organ, be-wails the “carrying of strife into the ranks of the workers”. 
 This is the point of view of the liberal gentleman. 
 We wel-come the “carrying of strife into the ranks of the workers”, for they and they alone will distinguish between “strife” and differences on principles; they will sort out these differencesfor themselves , form their own opinion and decide not “with whom to go, but where to go”, * i. 
e. 
, their own definite and clear line, drawn up and tested by themselves. 
 That day is approaching and it has come. 
 The mass of Pravdist workers can already distinguish between “strife” and differences; they have already sorted out these disagree-ments for themselves and have already determined their own line. 
 The figures concerning the workers’ groups after two years of open struggle (1912 and 1913) have proved this in fact . 
 Narrow circle diplomacy is coming to an end. 
 ** *As it was magnificently expressed by the Moscow workers (see Rabochy No. 
 6, of May 29, 1914), who at once saw through the fraud of Plekhanov’s Yedinstvo .

 WHY THE WORKERS’ ORGANISATIONS PUBLICLY DENOUNCED THE LIQUIDATORS AS SLANDERERS? Put Pravdy , issue No. 
 92 for May 21, 1914, published the resolution adopted by representatives of ten industrial or-ganisations in the city of Moscow . 
 This resolution very em-phatically and sharply condemned Malinovsky’s disruptiveresignation as a “crime”, then expressed complete confid-ence in the Russian Social-Democratic Labour group in the Duma (“march firmly along your road—the working class iswith you!”), and lastly, publicly denounced the liquidatorsof Nasha Rabochaya Gazeta as people who “ throw scurrilous abuse at the retiring deputy ”; these people’s conduct is com-pared with “the spreading of slanderous rumours by the Right press with the object of creating confusion in the ranks of the workers”. 
 “It is the sacred duty of all those to whom the cause of labour is dear,” the representatives of the ten industrialorganisations of Moscow stated in their resolution, “to rallytheir forces and offer united resistance to the slanderers. 
” “In reply, the working class will rally more closely around its representatives [i. 
e. 
, the Russian Social-DemocraticLabour group] and contemptuously ignore the slanderers . 
” There is no need for us to quote any more of the numerous workers’ resolutions couched in similar terms, or the opinionof the Lettish workers’ newspaper, * etc. 
 That would be need less repetition. 
 Let us see what happened. 
Why did the class-conscious workers of Russia, through the representatives of ten industrial organisations in Moscow,and many others, publicly denounce the liquidators of remennik ) is another sample of narrow circle diplomacy, for not one of them had the courage to say to the workers beforehand, plainly and straightforwardly, “I am joining this alliance for such and such a reason ”. 
 As the fruit of narrow circle diplomacy, Sovremennik is a still-born undertaking. 
 *“We do not think it is necessary to deal with the rumours that have been circulated by the press, or with the downright slanderuttered against Malinovsky and against the whole group and its con-sistent line because such slander is always spread for a dishonest purpose , and always proves false. 
” ( Trudovaya Pravda No. 
 1, May 23, 1914. 
) Nasha Rabochaya Gazeta as filthy slanderers, and call upon the working class contemptuously to ignore them? What did Nasha Rabochaya Gazeta do? It spread insidious rumours and insinuations to the effect that Malinovsky is an agent provocateur. 
 It did not name a single accuser. 
 It did not quote a single definite fact. 
 It did not submit a scrap of definitely formulat-ed evidence, backed by references to at least Party pseu-donyms, to objects of police raids, dates, or anything of the kind. 
 All we had was insidious rumours, an attempt to create a sensation out of Malinovsky’s “inexplicable” resignationfrom the Duma. 
 But it was precisely for this inexplicableresignation, for this secret flight that the organised workers, the members of the workers’ party, severely censured Mali-novsky. 
 The organised Marxist workers at once called together all their various local, trade union, Duma and all-Russiadirecting bodies, and straightforwardly and publicly de-clared to the proletariat and to the world at large: Malinov-sky did not give us the reasons for his resignation, nor did he give us any warning of it. 
 This inexplicable behaviour, thisact of unprecedented insubordination, makes his conductthat of a deserter at a time when we are waging a grim, ar-duous and responsible class struggle. 
 We have judged thedeserter and ruthlessly condemned him. 
 There is no more to be said about it. 
 The case is closed. 
 “One person is nothing. 
 The class is everything. 
 Stick to your guns. 
 We are with you” (telegram sent by forty Moscowshop assistants to the Russian Social-Democratic Labourgroup. 
 See Put Pravdy No. 
 86, May 14, 1914). 
 The case is closed. 
 The organised workers saw it through to the end in an organised manner, then closed their ranks for further work. 
 Forward, to work! But intellectualist circles behave differently. 
 The “inex-plicable” affair does not induce them to deal with it in anorganised manner ( not a single leading body of the liquida-tors or of their friends came out with an open, straightfor-ward and full appraisal of the merits of the case !) but rouses scandal-mongering interest. 
 Ah, “here is something inexplic-able!”—the gossips of intellectual society are intrigued. 
 The gossips have no facts whatever to go by. 
 The scandal-mongers of Martov’s circle are incapable of organised action, of calling together a committee, collecting information of political interest or significance, of verifying, analysing,jointly discussing, and formulating an official and respon-sible decision for the guidance of the proletariat. 
 Thegossips are incapable of doing anything like that. 
 But then these intellectual gossips are past masters of the art of scandal-mongering, of going to or from Martov (or other filthy slanderers like him) and encouraginginsidious rumours, or picking up and passing on insinua-tions! Whoever has been but once in the company of thesescandal-mongering intellectualist gossips will certainly(unless he is a gossip himself) retain for the rest of his life disgust for these despicable creatures. 
 Each to his own. 
 Every social stratum has its own way of life, its own habits and inclinations. 
 Every insect has its ownweapon. 
 Some insects fight by excreting a foul-smellingliquid. 
 The organised Marxist workers acted in an organised man-ner. 
 They closed in an organised manner the case of the un-sanctioned resignation of a former colleague, and carried onwith their work, went on with the struggle in an organisedmanner. 
 The liquidationist intellectualist gossips could notand did not go further than filthy gossip and slander. 
 The organised Marxist workers at once recognised these gossips, from the very first articles in Nasha Rabochaya Gazeta , and at once gave them the appraisal they fully deserved: “filthy slander”, “contemptuously ignore them”. 
Not a shadow of belief in the “rumours” circulated by Mar-tov and Dan; a firm determination to ignore them, to attachno importance to them. 
 Incidentally, the workers, who were indignant with the liquidators, referred in their resolutions to the liquidatorsin general. 
 I believe it would have been far more correct toname Martov and Dan, as was done in Lenin’s telegram, 200 and in some of the articles and resolutions. 
 We have no groundsfor accusing all the liquidators and branding them publicly for indulging in filthy slander. 
 But for ten years, beginning with their attempt to flout the will of the Second (1903)Party Congress, Martov and Dan have repeatedly shown their “style” of fighting by means of insinuations and filthy slan-der. 
 It was of no avail for these two individuals to try and hide behind the plea that somebody or other was divulging the names of the actual editors of Novaya Rabochaya Gazeta . 
 Nowhere has a word or a sound been uttered about editor-ship, or actual editors. 
 But the slanderers, whom the workers’ party knows from its ten years of history, had to be named, and named they were. 
 The slanderers tried to bamboozle the inexperienced, or those utterly incapable of thinking for themselves, by means ofthe “plausible” demand for an “unofficial” trial. 
 They pleadedignorance of anything definite, asserted that they were notaccusing anybody, that rumours were “not enough” to ground a charge on, for they could serve only as a basis for “investi-gation ”! But the entire corpus delicti —to use a legal term—of filthy slander consists in people circulating insidious, anon-ymous rumours in the press, without mentioning a singlehonest citizen, or a single reputable and responsible demo-cratic body capable of vouching for the truth of these ru-mours! That is the crux of the matter. 
Martov and Dan have long been known and repeatedly exposed as slanderers. 
 This has been spoken of dozens oftimes in the press abroad. 
 When Martov, in collaboration with and on the responsibility of Dan, wrote the special libellous pamphlet, Saviours or Destroyers , even the mild and cautious Kautsky, who has of late been greatly given tomaking “concessions” to the liquidators, called it “ disgusting ”. 
 That is a fact long ago published in the press abroad. 
And after this, Martov and Dan want us to agree to an investigation undertaken on their initiative, on the basis of their slanderous statements, and with the participation of the very groups that shield them! That is downright impudence, and sheer stupidity on the part of the slanderers. 
 We do not believe a single word of Dan’s and Martov’s. 
 We shall never agree to any “investigation” into insidious rumours with the participation of the liquidators and the groups that help them. 
 This would mean covering up the crime committed by Martov and Dan. 
 We shall however thoroughly expose it to the working class. 
 When Martov and Dan, with their backers, the Bundists, Chkheidze and Co. 
, the August bloc members, etc. 
, directlyor indirectly call upon us to conduct a joint “investigation”with them, we say in reply: “We do not trust Martov andDan. 
 We do not regard them as honest citizens. 
 We shalltreat them as despicable slanderers and nothing else. 
” Let those who shield Dan and Martov, or the weak-kneed intellectuals who believe the “rumours” circulated by thosegentlemen, bemoan the idea of a bourgeois court. 
 That doesnot frighten us. 
 Against the blackmailers, we are always and absolutely in favour of the bourgeois legality of a bourgeois court. 
 When a man says: “Give me a hundred rubles, otherwise I shall reveal the fact that you are unfaithful to your wife andare living with A. 
”—that is criminal blackmail. 
 In sucha case we are in favour of appealing to a bourgeois court. 
 When a man says: “Make political concessions to me, rec-ognise me as an equal member of the Marxist body, or else I shall spread rumours about Malinovsky being an agent provocateur”—that is political blackmail. 
 In such a case we are in favour of appealing to a bourgeois court. 
 And this point of view was adopted by the workers them-selves who, as soon as they read the very first articles of Dan and Martov, distrusted them, and did not say to themselves: “Really, if Martov and Dan write about these ‘rumours’they must be true?” No, the workers grasped the point at once and said: “The working class will ignore filthy slander. 
” Either make a direct charge backed by your signatures, so that a bourgeois court may convict and punish you (there are no other means of combating blackmail), or continue to carry the stigma of slanderers that the representatives of theten workers’ industrial organisations have publicly placedupon you. 
 That is the alternative that confronts you, Messrs. 
Martov and Dan! A leading body investigated these rumours and pro-nounced them absurd. 
 The workers of Russia trust this body, and it will utterly expose those who spread slander. 
 Martov must not think that he will remain unexposed. 
 But, you will say, the political groups which defend the liquidators, or even partly sympathise with them, do not trust our leading body. 
 Of course they do not. 
 We do not want them to trust us, and we shall not take a single step that might suggest that we place the slightest trust in them. 
 We say: Gentlemen, members of the groups that trust Martov and Dan, and want to “unite” with them, all ofyou August bloc people, Trotskyists, Vperyodists, Bundists, and so on, and so forth, please come out in the open and show your true colours! Either of two things, gentlemen: Since you yourselves want to “unite” with Martov and Dan, and call upon the workers to do so, that shows thatyou (unlike us) trust the recognised leaders of the ideologi-cal political trend known as the liquidators. 
 Since you trust them and consider it possible to “unite” with them, admit it and advocate it, then do something; don’t merely talk about it! Either you call upon Dan and Martov (you trust them and they trust you) to disclose the source of the “rumours”,investigate them yourselves, and then publicly declare to the working class: We vouch for the fact that this is not the silly scandal of gossips, or the spiteful insinuations of angryliquidators, but weighty and serious evidence. 
 When you do that and prove that the moment these rumours arose, theliquidationist, Plekhanovist, and other leading bodies exam-ined them and immediately informed the Pravdist leading body, we shall answer: Gentlemen, we are convinced that you are mistaken and we shall prove that to you, but weadmit that you have behaved like honest democrats. 
 Or else, you—leaders of “trends” and groups which call upon the workers to unite with the liquidators—hide behindthe backs of Dan and Martov, allow them to utter as much slander as they please, refrain from calling upon them to disclose their sources, and do not take the trouble ( and the political responsibility ) to verify the truth of the rumours. 
 In that case we shall openly declare to the workers: Com-rades, don’t you see that all these group leaders are aiding and abetting these filthy slanderers? We shall see what the workers will decide. 
 For the sake of illustration, we shall take a concrete case. 
 When the leading body, which is recognised by four-fifths of the class-conscious workers of Russia, declared that it had investigated the rumours and was absolutely convinced that they were utterly absurd (if not worse), two groups made statements in the press: (1) the group of Chkheidze,Chkhenkeli, Skobelev, Khaustov, Tulyakov, Mankov andJagiello; (2) the August bloc people, i. 
e. 
, the leadingAugust body of the liquidators. 
 What did they say? Only that they had taken no part in the investigation into the rumours conducted by the leading body of the Pravdists!That is all they said! Let us consider this case. 
Let us suppose, firstly, that instead of the group of Chkheidze and Co. 
 we have honest democrats before us. 
 Let us assume that these people had elected Malinovsky as the vice-chairman of their Duma group. 
 Suddenly, rumours appear in the press, in the organ for which they are politi-cally responsible, to the effect that Malinovsky is an agentprovocateur! Can there possibly be two opinions about what the ele-mentary and bounden duty of all honest democrats should be under such circumstances? Their duty should be immediately to appoint a committee from their own ranks or anybody else they please, immediate-ly to investigate the source of these rumours, those whohave spread them and when they did so, ascertain the authenticity and grounds of these rumours, and then declare publicly, straightforwardly and honestly to the workingclass: Comrades, we have worked, we have investigated and we vouch for the fact that this is a serious matter. 
 That is what honest democrats would do. 
 But to say noth-ing, to refrain from any investigation, and to continue to bear responsibility for a press organ that spreads insidious rumours means sinking to the lowest depths of meannessand baseness, means behaving in a manner unworthy of anhonest citizen. 
 Secondly, let us assume that instead of Chkheidze and Co. 
 we have before us aiders and abettors of filthy slander, who either heard these insidious rumours from Martov or his friends but never thought of taking them seriously (forwho among those that have anything to do with Social-Democratic activity has not, scores of times, heard patently absurd “rumours” it would be ridiculous to pay attention to?) or who heard nothing at all, but, knowing the Dan and Martov “style”, preferred not to “get mixed up in sucha complicated and troublesome business” 201 for fear of be-smirching and disgracing themselves for the rest of theirlives by openly expressing belief in the truth of the rumoursspread in the press by Martov and Dan, but at the same time desired surreptitiously to shield the latter. 
 People like the ones we have taken in our second assump-tion would behave precisely in the way Chkheidze and Co. 
 did. 
 The same applies fully to the August bloc men. 
Let the workers themselves choose one of these two assump-tions; let them examine and ponder over the conduct of Chkheidze and Co. 
 Now let us examine Plekhanov’s behaviour. 
 In issue No. 
 2 of Yedinstvo he describes the liquidators’ articles on Mali-novsky as “outrageous” and “disgusting”, but he adds, obvious-ly as a reproach to the Pravdists: this is the fruit of your splitting tactics. 
 “It’s no use crying over spilt milk!” How is this behaviour of Plekhanov’s to be interpreted?If, despite the plain statement by Dan and Martov that they regarded these rumours as true and authentic (otherwisethey would not have demanded an investigation), Plekha-nov describes the liquidators’ articles as outrageous and dis-gusting, it shows that he does not in the least trust Dan and Martov! It shows that he, too, regards them as filthy slan-derers! If that were not the case, what reasonable grounds would there have been for publicly describing as “disgusting”,articles written by people who desire (as they claim) to pro-mote the cause of democracy and of the proletariat by expos-ing a grave and frightful evil, namely, agents provocateurs? But if Plekhanov does not believe a single word of Mar-tov’s and Dan’s, if he regards them as filthy slanderers, howcan he blame us Pravdists for the methods of struggle employed by the liquidators who have been expelled from the Party! How can he write: “It’s no use crying over spilt milk. 
” This can only mean that he justifies Dan and Martov on the grounds of the “split ”! That is monstrous, but it is a fact. 
 Plekhanov justifies filthy slanderers, whom he himself does not trust in the least, on the grounds that the Prav-dists are to blame for having expelled these slanderers fromthe Party. 
 This behaviour of Plekhanov’s (as he has already been told publicly by a “group of Marxists” who were ready to be-lieve him, but were soon disillusioned in him) is a diplo-matic defence of blackmailers, i. 
e. 
; a defence prompted by narrow circle diplomacy, which is objectively tantamount toencouraging the blackmailers to continue with their black-mailing. 
 Since we—Martov and Dan must be arguing—succeeded at once in getting the “anti-liquidationist” Plekhanov, who does not trust us, to blame the Pravdists, even indirectly, even partly, for driving us into this desperate struggle bytheir “split”, why ... why, let’s carry on! Let’s continue onthe same lines. 
 Plekhanov encourages us to hope that we shall obtain concessions as a reward for our blackmail! * The workers straightaway saw through Plekhanov’s narrow circle diplomacy. 
 This was proved by the opinion the Moscow workers expressed about issue No. 
 1 of Yedinstvo , and by the reply of the “group of Marxists” who were inclinedto trust Plekhanov but later called him a “diplomat”. 
 202 Before very long Plekhanov’s narrow circle diplomacy willbe utterly exposed. 
 In January 1912, representatives of the workers publicly and officially expelled from the Party a definite group ofliquidators headed by Martov and Dan. 
 Since then, in thecourse of two-and-a-half years, the workers of Russia have *The reader will find that Trotsky engages in the same defence of blackmail as Plekhanov does, only in a more covert and cowardly form. 
 In issue No. 
 6 of Borba , he, a contributor to Nasha Rabochaya Gazeta , does not utter a word in condemnation of the “campaign” conducted by Dan and Martov, but accuses the Pravdists of sowing“the poisonous seeds of hatred and splitting” (p. 
 44)! Thus, not slan-der, oh, no, but carrying out the Party’s decision concerning thosewho are vehicles of bourgeois influence and who hurl abuse at the “un-derground” must be regarded as “poison”. 
 Very well, we shall place this on record. 
 approved of this decision by a four-fifths majority, and adopt-ed it as their own . 
 The blackmail and slander of Martov and Dan will not induce the workers to “make concessions”, but will convince them more firmly than ever that only without the liquidators and against them is it possible to build up the workers’ “entire Marxist body”, four-fifths of which hasalready been built. 
 Everybody is now talking about the growth of the Russian workers’ political consciousness, about the fact that they them-selves are now handling all affairs connected with the workers’party, and their greater maturity and independence afterthe revolution. 
 Trotsky and Plekhanov also appeal to the workers against “intellectuals’ circles” or the “factionalism of the intellectuals”. 
 But—and this is a remarkable circum-stance!—as soon as mention is made of the objective facts showing which political trend the present-day class-conscious workers of Russia choose, approve of and create, Plekhanov,Trotsky and the liquidators all change their ground and shout: These workers, the Pravdist workers, who form the majority of the class-conscious workers in Russia, follow thelead of Pravdism only because they are “bewildered” ( Borba No. 
 1, p. 
 6), are only “ being swayed ” by “demagogy”, or fac-tionalism, etc. 
, etc. 
 It follows, therefore, that the liquidators, Plekhanov, and Trotsky recognise the will of the majority of the class-conscious workers, not in the present, but in the future, only in the future event of the workers agreeing with them, withthe liquidators, Plekhanov, and Trotsky! What amusing subjectivism! What an amusing dread of objective facts! But if we are not to engage simply in mutual recriminations, accusing each other of intellectualist parochialism, we must take the present facts, the objective facts. 
 The political education of the workers, which everybody admits is making progress, is another thing which our con-ciliators, Plekhanov, Trotsky and Co. 
, talk about with amus-ing subjectivism. 
 Plekhanov and Trotsky are wavering between the two contending trends in the Social-Democraticclass movement and are ascribing to the workers their own subjective vacillations, saying: The fact that the workers participate in this conflict of trends is evidence of their ignor-ance; when they become more enlightened they will stop fighting, will cease to be “factional” (Plekhanov, like Trotsky,repeats “by force of habit” parrot-phrases such as “factional-ism”, although the Pravdists put an end to “factionalism” inJanuary 1912, i. 
e. 
, two-and-a-half years ago, by straight-forwardly and openly expelling the liquidators). 
 The subjectivism of this appraisal of the situation by Plekhanov and Trotsky is most glaring. 
 Turn to history—after all, there is no harm in a Marxist turning to the historyof the movement!—and you will find a story of nearly twenty years ’ struggle against the bourgeois trends of Economism (1895-1902), Menshevism (1903-08) and liquidationism (1908-14). 
 There can be no doubt whatever about the un-broken connection and continuity between these three varietiesof “bourgeois influence on the proletariat”. 
 It is a historicalfact that the advanced workers of Russia participated inthis struggle and sided with the Iskrists against the Econo-mists, with the Bolsheviks against the Mensheviks (as Levitsky himself was compelled to admit by the weight of objective facts), and lastly, with Pravdism against liquida-tionism. 
 The question arises: Does not this historical fact concern-ing the mass Social-Democratic workers’ movement point to something more important than the subjective and pious wishes of Plekhanov and Trotsky, who for the last ten years have been giving themselves credit for their failure to fallinto step with the mass Social-Democratic workers’ trend? The objective facts of the present period, taken from both sources—the liquidationist and Pravdist—as well as thehistory of the last twenty years, abundantly prove that the struggle against liquidationism and the victory achieved over it is precisely the result of the political education of the Russian workers and of the formation of a genuine workers’ party which does not yield to petty-bourgeois influences in a petty-bourgeois country. 
 Plekhanov and Trotsky, who offer the workers their sub-jective pious wishes for the avoidance of conflict (wishes which ignore both history and the mass trends among theSocial-Democrats), look upon the political education of the workers from the point of view of copy-book maxims. 
 His-tory has existed up to now, but now it has ceased to exist— as Marx wittily retorted in his criticism of Proudhon. 
203 Up to now, for twenty years, the workers have received their political education solely in the course of the struggle againstthe bourgeois trend of Economism and against the later va-rieties of a similar trend, but now, after a couple of “copy-book”maxims about the harmfulness of conflicts, maxims served up by Plekhanov and Trotsky, history will cease, the mass roots of liquidationism (which owe their mass character tothe support of the bourgeoisie) will vanish, mass Pravdism(which became a mass movement solely as a result of the“bewilderment” of the workers!) will vanish, and something“real” will arise .... 
 The reasoning followed by Plekhanov and Trotsky is truly amusing! The workers can obtain real political education only in the course of a sustained, consistent, all-out struggle of pro-letarian influences, aspirations and trends against bour-geois influences, aspirations and trends. 
 Not even Trotsky will deny that liquidationism like the Economism of 1895-1902) is a manifestation of bourgeois influence on the proletariat; as for Plekhanov, he himself , in the long-dis-tant past, fully a year-and-a-half or two-and-a-half years ago,defended the Party decision which established this truth. 
 But nowhere in the world have bourgeois influences on the workers ever taken the form of ideological influences alone. 
 When the bourgeoisie’s ideological influence on the workers declines, is undermined or weakened, the bourgeoi-sie everywhere and always resorts to the most outrageous lies and slander. 
 And every time that Martov and Dan flouted thewill of the majority of organised Marxists, every time theylacked the weapon of the ideological struggle, they resorted to the weapon of insinuation and slander. 
 Till now, however, they have done this in conditions of exile abroad, before a relatively limited “audience”, and oftengot away with it. 
 But this time they have come out beforetens of thousands of Russian workers and have immediatelypulled up short. 
 The “trick” of emigrants’ gossip and slander has missed fire. 
 The workers have already proved politically educated enough to see at once the insincerity, the dis-honesty of the utterances of Martov and Dan from the very character of these utterances, and they have denounced them publicly, before the whole of Russia, as slanderers. 
 The advanced workers of Russia have taken another step forward along the road of political education by knocking out of the hands of one bourgeois group (the liquidators) the weapon of slander. 
 Neither the bourgeois alliance between Plekhanov and Trotsky, the liquidationist leaders, and the Narodniks, nor the efforts of the liberal press to proclaim it the duty of “honest” people to secure unity between the workers and those whowant to liquidate the workers’ party, nor the campaign ofslander conducted by Martov and Dan will check the growthand development of proletarian solidarity with the ideas,programme, tactics and organisation of Pravdism.

 Ilyin THE VPERYODISTS AND THE VPERYOD GROUP The St. 
 Petersburg liquidators’ newspaper has published an article by A. 
 Bogdanov containing the sharpest accu-sations against Pravda and Pravdism. 
 The journal run by Trotsky, who yesterday was the close friend of the liqui-dators and today has half deserted them, has now pub-lished a letter (No. 
 4, p. 
 56) from the Paris and Geneva circles of the Vperyod ideological and Marxist group. 
 In Russia only a single group—in the Caucasus—has come out in defence of this Paris-Geneva group, which hasbeen in existence since 1909, i. 
e. 
, for about five years. 
 Inview of this, it would seem a waste of time to add anything to the explanations already given in Put Pravdy . 
 * However, the persistence of the liquidators and their quondam friend Trotsky in defending the Vperyod group impels us to reply to them once again, the more so that theaccumulating evidence of an actual alliance between theliquidators, Trotsky and the Vperyod people affords an op-portunity of explaining to the workers in Russia the political significance of this alliance from the standpoint of principle. 
 The Vperyod group broke away from the Bolsheviks abroad in 1909. 
 At the end of that year it issued a pamphletentitled: The Present Moment and the Tasks of the Party , in which the “platform” of this group was expounded. 
 “In the work of drafting this platform,” we read on page 32 of this pamphlet, “fifteen Party members participated, of whom seven were workers and eight intellectuals. 
 The major part of the platform was adopted unanimously. 
 Only on the question of the Duma did threeabstain (two otzovists and one ‘anti-boycottist’). 
” This platform (p. 
 17 and others) defended “proletarian philosophy”. 
 *See pp. 
 121-24 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 Of the names of Vperyodists whom the latter themselves have mentioned in the press, we shall mention the following: N. 
 Maximov, Voinov, Alexinsky, Lunacharsky, Lyadov, S. 
 A. 
 Volsky, Domov and A. 
 Bogdanov. 
204 What has become of these Vperyodists?N. 
 Maximov has left the Vperyod group. 
 Voinov and Alexinsky remained in the group, but later fell out with each other and now belong to two different Vperyod groups. 
 This was officially announced in Paris. 
 A. 
 Lunacharsky has fallen out with Alexinsky. 
Lyadov has evidently left the group; nothing is known of his attitude towards the new split in the Vperyod group. 
 S. 
 A. 
 Volsky has gone over to the Left Narodniks, judging from his regular contributions to the latter’s publications (see Zavety ). 
 Domov published, in Vperyod No. 
 3 (May 1911), a state-ment that “he was no longer taking any part whatever inthe publications of the Vperyod group” (p. 
 78). 
 A. 
 Bogdanov has announced in the press that he has left the Vperyod group. 
 Such are the facts. 
 And now compare these facts with the statement of the Paris and Geneva Vperyodists published by Trotsky: “The assertion by Put Pravdy that, from the moment it came into being, the Vperyod group consisted of heterogeneous anti-Marx-ist elements loosely stuck together, and fell to pieces with the revivalof the working-class movement, does not correspond to the facts. 
” The reader will see from this that the Vperyodists’ state-ment published by Trotsky, who is perfectly familiar withall the names we have mentioned and with the entire historyof the Vperyod group, which he has assisted on more than one occasion, is an outrageous and glaring-falsehood, and that what Put Pravdy said was the absolute truth. 
 We shall also recall the following fact. 
 Sovremenny Mir , in 1910 or 1911 I think, published a review by G. 
 A. 
 Ale-xinsky of a book by A. 
 A. 
 Bogdanov, in which the latterwas referred to as a “gentleman” who had nothing in commonwith Marxism. 
 How is this to be explained? It is to be explained by the fact that the Vperyodists were really a group of heterogeneous, anti-Marxist elements, loosely stuck together. 
 As regards ideological trend, there were two such elements there, Machism and otzovism, which, incidentally, is evident from the passages quoted above. 
 Machism is the philosophy of Mach and Avenarius, modi-fied by Bogdanov. 
 It is advocated by Bogdanov, Lunacharskyand Volsky, and is concealed in the Vperyod platform under the pseudonym of “proletarian philosophy”. 
 In effect, thisphilosophy is a species of philosophical idealism, i. 
e. 
, a subtle defence of religion, and it was no accident that Lunacharsky has slipped from this philosophy into advocat-ing a blending of scientific socialism with religion. 
 Eventoday, A. 
 Bogdanov, in a number of “new” books, defendsthis utterly anti-Marxist and utterly reactionary philosophy,which both the Menshevik G. 
 V. 
 Plekhanov and the Bol-shevik V. 
 Ilyin 205 have strongly opposed. 
 We now ask all and sundry whether the liquidators A. 
 Bogdanov, Trotsky and the Paris-Geneva Vperyodists actedhonestly when, in publishing statements by Vperyod and about Vperyod , they concealed from the Russian workers: 1) the fact that the Vperyod group itself included “prole-tarian philosophy”, i. 
e. 
, “Machism”, in its platform; 2) the fact that Marxists belonging to different groups waged a long and persistent struggle against “Machism” asan out-and-out reactionary philosophy; 3) the fact that even Alexinsky, that ardent Vperyodist, who signed this platform jointly with the Machists, was some time later compelled to protest in the sharpest possible terms against Machism. 
 We shall now deal with otzovism. 
We have seen above that the otzovists belonged to the Vperyod group. 
 This group’s platform—as was pointed out immediately it appeared in the press abroad—contained a veiled form of otzovism and unpardonable concessions to it, for example, in point d), on p. 
 16 of the platform, where itsays that (for a certain period) “none of the semi-legal and legal ways and means of struggle of the working class, including participation in the Duma, can be of inde-pendent and decisive importance”. 
 This is the same old otzovism, only veiled, vague and confused. 
 Both the Party Bolsheviks, i. 
e. 
, those opposed to liquidationism, and the pro-Party Mensheviks have repeat-edly explained that such a platform is unacceptable to So-cial-Democrats, that it is a defence of otzovism, utterly fallacious and most harmful. 
 The otzovists were opposed to going into the Third Duma, but events clearly showed that they were mistaken, andthat, in fact , their point of view led to anarchism. 
 The veiled and modified defence of otzovism that we have quoted could not, in practice , have resulted in the line which Pravda successfully pursued, and which led the Prav-dists to victory over the disruptors of the Party, the liquida-tors, in the vast majority of the legal and ultra-legal work-ing-class organisations. 
 That is why, when the Vperyodists to this day talk of “uncurtailed Left Marxism”, it is our duty to speak up and warn the workers; it is our duty to declare that these finewords contain an anti-Marxist doctrine which will cause im-mense harm to the working-class movement, and is abso-lutely incompatible with the latter. 
 This Vperyodist species of “uncurtailed Left Marxism” is a travesty of Bolshevism, as the Bolsheviks said and proved long back, over five years ago. 
 Even if the Vperyodists havefailed to realise it, we virtually have here a deviation fromMarxism towards anarchism. 
 The Plenum of January 1910—the very Plenum which the Vperyodists refer to in Trotsky’s journal as having endorsed their group— unanimously condemned this deviation as being just as harmful as the liquidators’ deviation. 
Throughout 1910 the leading bodies set up by the Plenum tocarry out its decisions, for example, the Editorial Boardof the Central Organ, 206 repeatedly and at great length point-ed out in the columns of their publications that the Vpe-ryodists, like the liquidators, were violating the decisions of the Plenum, and that, like the liquidators, they were infact v ehicles of bourgeois influence on the proletariat . 
 Since, in Trotsky’s journal, the Vperyodists now refer to the “first and second Vperyod schools ”, we feel bound to recall the facts. 
 Half the workers left the first school because experience had convinced them of its anti-Marxist and disruptive character. 
 As regards the second school, theCentral Organ, in pursuance of the decisions of the Plenum, made a point of warning the workers against it and explained that it bore the character just mentioned. 
 But who helped this second school? Only the liquidators and Trotsky, notwithstanding the official warning given by the Party’s official organ. 
 In this second school we plainly see a bloc, an alliance, between the liquidators, the Vperyodists and Trotsky’sgroup exactly like the one we now see in the columns of the St. 
 Petersburg liquidationist newspaper and in Trotsky’s Borba . 
 This is an alliance of anti-Marxist and disruptive groups, which detest Pravda ’s Marxism and the comradely Party discipline which rallies the vast majority of the class-con-scious workers of Russia around Pravda . 
 We cannot but call “adventurism” this alliance, like the Vperyod group itself, and Vperyodism as a whole, for nothing can come of Vperyodism and of its “bloc” with Trotsky andthe liquidators except disregard of principles, the en-couragement of anti-Marxist ideas (without openly preachingthem), and the disruption of the working-class movement. 
 But while being basically and unswervingly opposed to Vperyod and Vperyodism, we have never, and never shall, shut the door against those Vperyodists who (like the major-ity of the founders of Vperyod ) are leaving that group and intend to help the majority of Russia’s class-conscious work-ers, organised and united by Pravdism. 
 No leniency what-ever must be shown towards the defence of Machism (from which, unfortunately, Bogdanov won’t budge), or of Vpe-ryodism; but no obstacles should be put in the way of com-rades who have conscientiously recognised Vperyod ’s mis-take and are turning from Vperyod back to the Party. 
 As regards the attacks and abuse to which “those writers Ilyin, Zinoviev and Kamenev” are subjected by Bogdanov in the liquidators’ newspaper and by the Vperyodists in Tro-tsky’s journal, we shall state briefly that these writers havealways carried out the decisions of the organised Marxist workers, who have demonstrated to all the world by theirsolidarity with Pravdism or by their votes in the election of the Metropolitan and All-Russia Insurance Boards, that they constitute the overwhelming majority of the or-ganised and class-conscious workers of Russia. 
 Acting in accordance with these decisions and in keeping with their spirit, these writers have every reason to consid-er that their activities are in harmony with the will of the majority of the Marxist workers, and they will not ofcourse be deterred from their activities by abuse comingfrom the Vperyodists, Trotsky and the liquidators. 
 The history of the Vperyod group, of its break-up, and its repeated blocs with Trotsky and the liquidators, is a matter of some general interest to the workers, and even of some public interest, for it represents a typical case of isolatedgroups of intellectuals being formed in the period of break-down and disintegration. 
 Anybody is at liberty to form aseparate ideological group and to point out a different roadto the proletariat, but much will be expected of any founder of a new group. 
 It goes without saying that nobody can be blamed for making mistakes, but to persist in mistakes that have been explained both by the theory and the practiceof a movement of over five years is tantamount to wagingwar against Marxism, against the organised and united ma-jority of the workers. 
 The vacillations and deviations of the liquidators and Vperyodists are no accident; they have been engendered bythe period of break-down and disintegration. 
 We see thesebourgeois deviations on both sides of the road of the classstruggle of the Marxist workers, and these serve as a warningto every class-conscious worker. 
 P. 
S. 
 The above lines were already written when we received a copy of Trotsky’s Borba containing another letter from “the Geneva, Paris and Tiflis Vperyod Marxist circles and from St. 
 Petersburg fellow-thinkers”. 
 From the signatures to this letter we see that during these four and a half years the Vperyodists, who issued “ their own ” platform at the very end of 1909, have acquired in Russiaone “Tiflis circle” and probably two “St. 
 Petersburg fellow-thinkers” (three would no doubt have constituted a St. 
Petersburg, or metropolitan, or all-Russia, Marxist ideo-logical circle!). 
 To anyone more or less seriously interested in politics, this result of Vperyod ’s four years of “activity” should suffice to serve as a criterion of this group. 
 Let Trotsky amuse himself by uniting with it in the columns of his “ own ” sheet; let the Vperyodists and Trotskyists play at being “powers”, “trends”, and contracting parties. 
 This is simply the childish make-believe of people who, by utter-ing pompous phrases, want to conceal the fact that their“groups” are mere bubbles. 
 It is amusing to read how these groups vociferate about unity and splits! Don’t you understand, gentlemen, that there can only be a question of the unity of the mass work-ing-class movement, the unity of the workers party; asfor unity with groups of intellectuals, who in the course offour years have found no support among the workers of Rus-sia, you and Trotsky can chatter to your heart’s contentabout that! That is not worth arguing about.

 XVII Before proceeding to the report on behalf of the Central Committee of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, I shall first of all take this opportunity of performing a pleasant duty, and on behalf of that body express profoundthanks to Comrade Vandervelde, Chairman of the ExecutiveCommittee of the International Socialist Bureau, for visitingour country and making himself personally acquainted withthe leaders of the working-class movement in St. 
 Peters-burg. 
 We are particularly grateful to Comrade Vandervelde for being the first to establish direct contact between prom-inent members of the International and the class-consciousand leading workers of Russia, and also for publishing inthe foreign socialist press (we have in mind Le Peuple and l’Humanité ) objective data on the working-class movement in Russia, data collected on the spot from the editors of the newspapers of the three trends, namely the Pravdist (i. 
e. 
,our Party), the liquidationist and the Socialist-Revolution-ary trends. 
 I shall divide my report on the question of the unity of the Russian Social-Democratic movement into the follow-ing four parts: (1) first, I shall explain the gist of the main differences among the Social-Democrats; (2) I shall thenquote data concerning the mass working-class movementin Russia, showing how our Party line has been tested by the experience of this movement ; (3) I shall explain how the line and position of our opponents have been tested by the same experience. 
 Fourth and last, I shall formulate, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Russian Social-DemocraticLabour Party, concrete, positive and practical proposals for unity. 
 I There are two bodies of opinion on what is at present taking place in the Russian Social-Democratic move-ment. 
 One opinion, expounded by Rosa Luxemburg in the proposal she made to the International Socialist Bureau last year (December 1913) and shared by the liqui-dators and the groups which support them, is as follows:in Russia the “chaos” of factional strife reigns among a mul-titude of factions, the worst of which, namely, the Lenin-ist faction, is most active in fomenting a split. 
 Actually,the differences do not preclude the possibility of joint activities. 
 The road to unity lies through agreement or com-promise among all trends and groups. 
 The other opinion, which we hold, is that there is nothing resembling “chaos of factional strife” in Russia. 
 The only thing we have there is a struggle against the liquidators, andit is only in the course of this struggle that a genuinely workers’ Social-Democratic Party is being built up, which has already united the overwhelming majority —four-fifths— of the class-conscious workers of Russia. 
 The illegal Party,in which the majority of the workers of Russia are organised,has been represented by the following conferences: theJanuary Conference of 1912, the February Conference of 1913, and the Summer Conference of 1913. 
 The legal organ of the Party is the newspaper Pravda (Vérité ), hence the name Pravdist. 
 Incidentally, this opinion was expressed by theSt. 
 Petersburg worker who, at a banquet in St. 
 Petersburgwhich Comrade Vandervelde attended, stated that theworkers in the factories of St. 
 Petersburg are united, and that outside of this unity of the workers there are only “gen-eral staffs without armies”. 
 In the second part of my report I shall deal with the objec-tive data which prove that ours is the correct opinion. 
 Andnow I shall deal with the substance of liquidationism. 
 The liquidationist groups were formally expelled from the Party at the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 Conference in January 1912, but the question of liquidationism was raised by our Partymuch earlier. 
 A definite official resolution, binding upon thewhole Party and unreservedly condemning liquidationism,was adopted by the All-Russia Conference of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
held as far back as December 1908 . 
 In this resolution liqui-dationism is defined as follows: (Liquidationism is) “an attempt on the part of some of the Party intelligentsia to liquidate the existing organisa-tion of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 and to substitute for it an amorphous federation acting at all cost within the limits of legality, even at the cost of openly abandoning the programme, tactics and traditions of the Party”. 
 From this it is evident that as far back as 1908 liquidation-ism was officially declared and recognised as an intellec-tualist trend, and that in substance it stood for the renun-ciation of the illegal Party and the substitution , or advocacy of the substitution, of a legal party for it. 
 The Central Committee’s plenary meeting held in January 1910 once again unanimously condemned liquidationism as “a manifestation of the influence of the bourgeoisie on the proletariat ”. 
 From this we see how mistaken is the opinion that our differences with the liquidators are no deeper and are less important than those between the so-called radicals andmoderates in Western Europe. 
 There is not a single—liter-ally not a single—West-European party that has ever hadoccasion to adopt a general party decision against peoplewho desired to dissolve the party and to substitute a new one for it! Nowhere in Western Europe has there ever been, nor can there ever be, a question of whether it is permissible tobear the title of party member and at the same time advocate the dissolution of that party, to argue that the party is use-less and unnecessary, and that another party be substituted for it. 
 Nowhere in Western Europe does the question con-cern the very existence of the party as it does with us, i. 
e. 
, whether that party is t o be or not to be . 
 This is not disagreement over a question of organisation, of how the party should be built, but disagreement concern-ing the very existence of the party. 
 Here, conciliation, agreement and compromise are totally out of the question. 
 We could not have built up our Party (to the extent of four-fifths) and cannot continue to build it otherwise thanby relentlessly fighting those publicists who in the legalpress fight against the “underground” (i. 
e. 
, the illegal Par-ty), declare it to be an “ evil”, justify and eulogise desertion from it, and advocate the formation of an “open party”. 
 In present-day Russia, where even the party of the extreme-ly moderate liberal is not legal, our Party can exist only as an illegal party. 
 The exceptional and unique feature of our position, which somewhat resembles that of the German Social-Democrats under the Anti-Socialist Law209 (although, even then, the Germans enjoyed a hundred times more legal-ity than we do in Russia), is that our illegal Social-Demo-cratic Labour Party consists of illegal workers’ organisations (often called “cells”) which are surrounded by a more or lessdense network of legal workers’ associations (such as sick insurance societies, trade unions, educational associations, athletic clubs, temperance societies, and so forth), Most ofthese legal associations exist in the metropolis; in manyparts of the provinces there are none at all. 
 Some of the illegal organisations are fairly large, others are quite small and in some cases they consist only of “trusted agents”. 
 210 The legal associations serve to some extent as a screen for the illegal organisations and for the extensive, legal ad-vocacy of the idea of working-class solidarity among themasses. 
 Nation-wide contacts between the leading workingclass organisations, the maintenance of a centre (the Central Committee) and the passing of precise Party resolutions on all questions—all these are of course carried out quite ille-gally and call for the utmost secrecy and trustworthinesson the part of advanced and tested workers. 
 To come out in the legal press against the “underground” or in favour of an “open party” is simply to disrupt our Party, and we must regard the people who do this as bitter enemies of our Party. 
 Naturally, repudiation of the “underground” goes hand in hand with repudiation of revolutionary tactics and advo-cacy of reformism. 
 Russia is passing through a period ofbourgeois revolutions. 
 In Russia even the most moderate bourgeois—the Cadets and Octobrists—are decidedly dis-satisfied with the government. 
 But they are all enemies ofrevolution and detest us for “demagogy”, for striving againto lead the masses to the barricades as we did in 1905. 
 Theyare all bourgeois who advocate only “reforms” and spreadamong the masses the highly pernicious idea that reform is compatible with the present tsarist monarchy. 
 Our tactics are different. 
 We make use of every reform (insurance, for example) and of every legal society. 
 But we use them to develop the revolutionary consciousness and the revolutionary struggle of the masses. 
 In Russia, where political freedom to this day does not exist, these words have far more direct implications for us than they havein Europe. 
 Our Party conducts revolutionary strikes , which in Russia are growing as in no other country in the world. 
Take, for example, the month of May alone. 
 In May 1912,64,000 and in May 1914, 99,000 workers were involved in economic strikes. 
 The number involved in political strikes was: 364,000 in 1912 and 647,000 in 1914. 
 The combination of politicaland economic struggle produces the revolutionary strike,which, by rousing the peasant millions, trains them forrevolution. 
 Our Party conducts campaigns of revolutionary meetings and revolutionary street demonstrations . 
 For this purpose our Party distributes revolutionary leaflets and an illegal newspaper , the Party’s Central Organ. 
 The ideologi-cal unification of all these propaganda and agitation activi-ties among the masses is achieved by the slogans adopted bythe supreme bodies of our Party, namely: (1) an eight-hour day; (2) confiscation of the landed estates, and (3) a demo-cratic republic. 
 In the present situation in Russia, whereabsolute tyranny and despotism prevail and where all lawsare suppressed by the tsarist monarchy, only these slogans can effectually unite and direct the entire propaganda andagitation of the Party aimed at effectually sustaining the revolutionary working-class movement. 
 It amuses us to hear the liquidators say, for example, that we are opposed to “freedom of association”, for we notonly emphasised the importance of this point of our pro-gramme in a special resolution adopted by the January Confer-ence of 1912, but we made ten times more effective use of the curtailed right of association (the insurance societies, for example) than the liquidators did. 
 But when people tellus in the legal press that the slogans of confiscation of theland and of a republic cannot serve as subjects for agitationamong the masses, we say that there can be no question ofour Party’s unity with such people, and such a group of publicists. 
 Since the purpose of this first part of my report is to ex-plain the gist of our differences, I shall say no more on this point, except to remind you that the fourth part of my re-port will contain practical proposals, with an exact list of all the cases where the liquidators have departed from our Party’s programme and decisions. 
 I shall not here go into the details of the history of the liquidators’ breakaway from our illegal Party, the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
, but will merely indicate the three main periods of this his-tory. 
 First period: from the autumn of 1908 to January 1910. 
 The Party combated liquidationism with the aid of precise,official, Party decisions condemning it. 
 Second period: from January 1910 to January 1912. 
 The liquidators hindered the work of restoring the Central Com-mittee of the Party; they disrupted the Central Committee of the Party and dismissed the last remnants of it, namely, the Technical Commission of the Bureau Abroad of the Central Committee. 
 211 The Party committees in Russia then (autumn 1911) set up the Russian Organising Commis-sion 212 for the purpose of restoring the Party. 
 That Commission convened the January Conference of 1912. 
 The Conference re-stored the Party, elected a Central Committee and expelled the liquidationist group from the Party. 
 Third period: from January 1912 to the present time. 
 The specific feature of this period is that a majority of four-fifths of the class-conscious workers of Russia have ralliedaround the decisions and bodies created by the January Conference of 1912. 
 I now come to the second part of my report, in which I shall describe the present state of our Party and of theliquidators in the light of the mass working-class movementin Russia. 
 I shall try to answer the question: does theexperience of the mass movement confirm the correctness of our Party’s line or of the liquidators’ line? II On April 22, 1912 (old style) the working-class daily, Prav-da, began to appear in Russia, thanks to the restoration of the Party at the January Conference of 1912; this newspa-per is pursuing the line (often by hints and alwaysin a curtailed form) laid down by that Conference. 
 Obviously, we never mention in any organ of the press the illegal connection that exists between the Party’s illegal Conference of January 1912 and the Central Committee it set up, on the one hand, and the legal newspaper Pravda , on the other. 
 In September 1912, the rival newspaper of theliquidators, Luch , now called Nasha Rabochaya Gazeta , began to appear. 
 Then, in the autumn of 1912, the FourthDuma elections took place. 
 In 1913, a new insurance law came into force in Russia, establishing sick funds for the workers. 
 Lastly, the legal trade unions, relentlessly perse-cuted by the government and repeatedly suppressed, were,nevertheless, constantly revived. 
 It is not difficult to understand that all these manifesta-tions of the mass working-class movement—especially the daily newspapers of the two trends—provide a vast amount of public, verifiable, and objective data. 
 We deem it our duty to the Executive Committee of the International SocialistBureau emphatically to protest against the habit of the liq-uidators and their defenders abroad of making unsubstan-tiated statements, assurances and declamations, while ignoring the objective facts of the mass working-class move-ment in Russia. 
 It is these facts that have definitely strengthened us in our conviction that the line we are pursuing is theright one. 
 In January 1912 the Conference of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
, which restored the illegal Party, was held. 
 The liquidators and the groups abroad (including Plekhanov) greeted it withabuse. 
 But what about the workers in Russia? The answer to this question was provided by the Fourth Duma elections. 
 These elections were held in the autumn of 1912. 
 Whereas in the Third Duma 50 per cent (four out of eight) of the dep-uties elected by the worker curia belonged to our trend,in the Fourth Duma six out of nine, i. 
e. 
, 67 per cent , of the deputies elected by the worker curia were supportersof the Party. 
 This proves that the masses of the workerssided with the Party and rejected liquidationism. 
 If the six members of the Duma, who incline towards liquidationism, now really desire unity with the Party group in the Duma, the Russian Social-Democratic Labour group, then we are obliged to say that recognition of the fact that these deputies are carrying out the will of the majority of the workers is the condition for unity. 
 To proceed. 
 Daily newspapers are extremely important media of working-class organisation . 
 They contain a vast amount of material proving this, i. 
e. 
, the figures showingthe number of contributions received from workers ’ groups . 
 Both newspapers, the Pravdist (i. 
e. 
, the Party) and the liq-uidationist, publish reports of financial contributions re-ceived from workers’ groups. 
 These reports are, for Russia,the best conceivable index—public and legal—of the actualstate of organisation of the masses of the workers. 
 In Western Europe, where the socialist parties are legal, the number of party members is known to everybody, and discussions concerning the organised working-class move-ment are always based on these figures. 
 In Russia we have no open, i. 
e. 
, legal party. 
 The Party’s organisations are illegal, secret, “underground”, as we say. 
But an indirect —and also unerring—index of the state of these organisations is provided by the number of financial contributions received from workers ’ groups . 
 These figures have been published openly and regularly in both newspapers—for over two years in ours and overeighteen months in the liquidators’—and if any false claimor mistake were made it would immediately have calledforth a protest on the part of the workers themselves. 
 Con-sequently, these figures are absolutely reliable and are the best public and legal index of the state of organisation of themasses of the workers. 
 Our liquidators, and the groups abroad which defend them, persistently ignore these figures, and say nothing about themin their press; but our workers merely regard this as evi-dence of their desire to flout the will of the majority of the workers , as evidence of their lack of honesty. 
 Here are the figures for the whole of 1913. 
 The Pravdists received 2,181 money contributions from workers’ groups,while the liquidators received 661. 
 In 1914 (up to May 13),the Pravdists had the support of 2,873 workers’ groups, and the liquidators, of 671. 
 Thus, the Pravdists organised 77 per cent of the workers’ groups in 1913, and 81 per cent in1914. 
 The Pravdists have been publishing these figures regu-larly since 1912, inviting investigation, pointing to their objective character, and calling upon the genuine (not hypocritical) friends of “unity” straightforwardly and honest-ly to submit to the will of the majority of the workers. 
Failing this , all their talk about unity is sheer hypocrisy. 
 After the liquidators had been fighting the Party for eighteen months, the class-conscious workers of Russia, by a four-fifths majority, approved of the Pravda line and dem-onstrated their loyalty to the “underground” and to rev-olutionary tactics. 
 What we expect from the liquidatorsand their friends is not phrases about “unity” against the Party’s will, but a straightforward answer to the question:do they or do they not accept the will of the vast majority of the class-conscious workers of Russia? It is easy to give empty assurances, but it is very dif-ficult to organise a genuine working-class newspaper that isreally maintained by the workers. 
 All the foreign comradesknow this, and they are more experienced than we are. 
A real working-class newspaper, i. 
e. 
, a newspaper that is really financed by the workers and which pursues the Party line, is a powerful instrument of organisation. 
 What do these figures show? These objective figures show that Pravda is a genuinely working-class newspaper, whereas the liquidationist newspaper, which repudiates the “under-ground”, i. 
e. 
, the Party, both in its ideas and in the sources from which it obtains its funds is, in fact , a bourgeois news-paper. 
 From January 1 to May 13, 1914, both newspapers, as usual, published reports of collections, and our newspaperpublished a summary of these reports. 
 Here are the results,Pravda collected R. 
21,584. 
11, of which R. 
18,934. 
10 came from workers’ groups. 
 Thus, 87 per cent of the contrib-utions came from organised workers and only 13 per centfrom the bourgeoisie. 
 The liquidators collected R. 
12,055. 
89, of which R. 
5,296. 
12 came from workers’ groups, i. 
e. 
, only 44 percent— less than half . 
 The liquidators get more than half their funds from bourgeois sources. 
 Moreover, day in day out the entire liberal-bourgeois press eulogises the liquidators, helps them to flout the will of the majority of the workers, and encourages them in their reformism and repudiation of the “underground”. 
 The activities of the groups abroad are exemplified in the newspaper Yedinstvo , run by Comrade Plekhanov, deputy Buryanov, and others. 
 I have before me three issues of thisnewspaper, the first for May 18 and the third for June 15 ofthis year. 
 The reports in these issues show that somebodycontributed 1000 rubles to the newspaper through Comrade Olgin, who lives abroad, while collections made abroad amounted to R. 
207. 
52. 
 Six (six!) workers’ groups con-tributed 60 rubles. 
 And this newspaper, which is supported by six workers’ groups in Russia, calls upon the workers not to heed theParty’s decisions, and calls it a “splitters’” Party! A Party which in the course of two-and-a-half years rallied 5,600 groups of workers around the definitely formulated decisions of the three illegal conferences of 1912 and 1913 is a “split-ters’” Party; whereas Plekhanov’s group, which united sixworkers’ groups in Russia and collected 1,200 rubles abroadfor the purpose of thwarting the will of the Russian workers, is a group which stands for “unity”, if you please! Plekhanov accuses others of being factionalists, as though making separate collections for a separate group, and callingupon the workers not to carry out the decisions adopted bya four-fifths majority, is not factionalism. 
 As for us, we say plainly that we regard the behaviour of Plekhanov’s group as a model of disruption . 
 Plekhanov’s conduct is the same as though Mehring, in Germany, were toorganise six workers’ groups and, in an independent news-paper, call upon the German Social-Democrats to defy theparty which had, let us assume, split away from the Poles. 
 Plekhanov and we speak in different tongues. 
 We call the solidarity of four-fifths of the workers in Russia real unity, and not unity merely in word; and we call disruption the struggle conducted by groups abroad—financed with moneycollected abroad—against the majority of the Russianworkers. 
 According to the figures Comrade Vandervelde obtained in St. 
 Petersburg and made public in the press, Pravda has a circulation of 40,000, while the liquidationist newspaperhas one of 16,000. 
 Pravda is maintained by the workers and pays its way, but the liquidationist newspaper is maintained by those whom our newspaper calls their rich friends from among the bourgeoisie . 
 We are submitting to the Executive Committee of the International Socialist Bureau the financial reports publishedin both newspapers. 
 To foreign comrades, who know what aserious business a working-class newspaper is, this will befar more convincing than assurances, promises, statements, and abuse of the Leninists. 
 We ask the liquidators: do they still choose to ignore the objective fact that their group’s newspaper is in effect a bourgeois undertaking run for the purpose of advocatingrepudiation of the “underground” and of flouting the will of the majority of the class-conscious workers of Russia? If they do, then all their talk about “unity” will continue to evoke derision from our workers. 
 Those who earnestly seek unity should sincerely admit that the entire liquidationist line is utterly fallacious, ashas been proved by Party decisions commencing with 1908,as well as by the experience of the struggle waged by the masses of the workers during the past two-and-a-half years. 
 To proceed. 
 Here are the objective figures concerning the election of workers’ representatives to the insurance bodies. 
We reject as mere liberalism all talk about political, con-stitutional reforms in present-day tsarist Russia and willhave nothing to do with it; but we take advantage of real reforms, such as insurance, in deed and not in word. 
 The entire workers’ group on the All-Russia Insurance Board consists of Pravda supporters , i. 
e. 
, of workers who have con-demned and rejected liquidationism. 
 During the electionto this All-Russia Insurance Board, 47 out of the 57 deleg-ates, i. 
e. 
, 82 per cent, were Pravdists. 
 During the election of the Metropolitan, St. 
 Petersburg, Insurance Board, 37 of the delegates were Pravdists and 7 were liquidators, thePravdists constituting 84 per cent. 
 The same can be said about the trade unions. 
 When they hear the talk of the Russian Social-Democrats abroad aboutthe “chaos of factional strife” in Russia (indulged in by Rosa Luxemburg, Plekhanov, Trotsky, and others), our foreign comrades perhaps imagine that the trade union movement inour country is split up. 
 Nothing of the kind. 
 In Russia there are no duplicate unions. 
 Both in St. 
 Petersburg and in Moscow, the trade unions are united . 
 The point is that in these unions the Pravdists completely predominate . 
 Not one of the thirteen trade unions in Moscow is liquida-tionist. 
 Of the twenty trade unions in St. 
 Petersburg listed in our Workers’ Calendar together with their membership, only the Draftsmen’s, Druggist Employees’ and Clerks’ Unions,and half the members of the Printers’ Union, are liquidation-ist. 
 In all the other unions—Metalworkers’, Textile Work-ers’, Tailors’, Woodworkers’, Shop Assistants’, and so forth—the Pravdists completely predominate. 
 And we say plainly: if the liquidators do not want drasti-cally to change their tactics and put a stop to their disruptivestruggle against the organised majority of the class-con-scious workers in Russia, let them stop talking about “unity”. 
 Every day Pravda commends the “ underground ”, if only obliquely, and condemns those who repudiate it. 
 And the workers follow the lead of their Pravda . 
 Here are figures on the illegal press published abroad. 
 After the liquidators’ August Conference in 1912, our Party, up to June 1914, put out five issues of an illegal leading political newspaper; the liquidators —nil; the Socialist-Revolutionaries— nine . 
 These figures do not include leaflets issued in Russia for revolutionary agitation during strikes, meetings and demonstrations. 
 In these five issues you will find mention of 44 illegal organisations of our Party; the liquidators— nil; the Socialist-Revo-lutionaries— 21 (mainly students’ and peasants). 
 Lastly, in October 1913, an independent Russian Social-Democratic Labour group was formed in the Duma, the aim of that group, unlike that of the liquidators, being to carry out, not flout, the will of the majority of the class-conscious workers of Russia. 
 At that time both newspapers published resolutions from workers all over Russia supporting either the line of the Party group or that of the liquidationist group. 
 The signatures to the resolutions in favour of the Prav-dist, i. 
e. 
, the Party group in the Duma, numbered 6,722, whereas those supporting the liquidationist group numbered 2,985 (including 1,086 signatures of Bundist workers and 719 of Caucasian workers). 
 Thus, together with all their allies, the liquidators succeeded in collecting less than one-third of the signatures. 
 These, briefly, are the objective data which we oppose to the bare statements by the liquidators. 
 These objectivedata on the mass working-class movement in Russia during the past two-and-a-half years definitely prove, through the experience of the class-conscious workers, that our Party line is correct. 
 Here I must digress and quote a concrete case to prove why “unity” or even “peace” with the present newspaper of thepresent liquidators is entirely ruled out. 
 This is an extremely important case, which will explain the attitude of the liquidators towards our Party’s illegal activities, and I therefore ask the comrades to pay specialattention to it. 
 It is common knowledge that since 1912 the revolutionary mass strikes have been developing with remarkable success inRussia. 
 The factory owners have tried to counter them with lockouts. 
 To formulate the Party’s attitude towards this form of struggle, a conference of our Party, held in Feb-ruary 1913 (note the date: 1913 !) drew up and published a resolution illegally . 
213 This resolution (page 11 of the illegal publication) def-initely advanced “the immediate task of organising revo-lutionary street demonstrations”. 
 It definitely recommended (ibid. 
) that “to counteract lockouts, new forms of struggleshould be devised, such as the go-slow strike, for example,and, instead of political strikes, revolutionary meetingsand revolutionary street demonstrations should be organ-ised”. 
 This, we repeat, was in February 1913, i. 
e. 
, six months after the August Conference (1912) of the liquidators, thevery same conference which assured the whole world thatthe liquidators were not opposed to the “underground”. 
 Neither during those six months, from August 1912 to Feb-ruary 1913, nor during the ensuing twelve months , from February 1913 to February 1914, did the August bloc issue a single resolution on this question. 
 Absolutely none! Listen further. 
 On March 20 1914, the St. 
 Petersburg factory owners decided to retaliate to a strike by declaring a lockout. 
 In one day 70,000 workers in St. 
 Petersburg were dis-missed. 
 In conformity with our Party’s resolution, the St. 
 Peters-burg Committee of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
, our Party’s illegal organ-isation in St. 
 Petersburg, decided to meet the lockoutwith a revolutionary demonstration on April 4, the anni-versary of the shootings in the Lena gold-fields. 
 214 It illegally issued an appeal to the workers, a copy of which lies before me now. 
 It is signed: “The St. 
 PetersburgCommittee of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
” It repeats the Party’s slogans(a republic and confiscation of the land) and ends with thewords: “Comrades! Come out onto the Nevsky Prospekt at 11 a. 
m. 
 on April 4. 
” Needless to say, Pravda itself , as a legal publication, could not mention this appeal, let alone reprint it. 
 What was to be done? How could it convey to its working-class readers, if only to the most class-conscious and advanced of them, the idea that it was necessary to support the illegal appeal for an illegal revolutionary demonstration? The only thing was to resort to the method that we always resort to, namely, hinting. 
 And so on the very day of the demonstration, on Friday, April 4, 1914, our paper ( Put Pravdy No. 
 54) published an unsigned leading article under the discreet heading: “Forms of the Working-Class Movement. 
” * This article makes direct mention of the “formal decision adopted by the Marxists inFebruary 1913” and hints at a demonstration of a revolu-tionary character in the following words: “The class-conscious workers are well acquainted with certain concrete cases when the movement rose to higher forms [i. 
e. 
, forms of the struggle] which, historically, weresubjected to repeated tests, and which are ‘unintelligible’and ‘alien’ only to the liquidators. 
” ( Put Pravdy , 1914, No. 
 54. 
) The Russian police and public prosecutors missed the hint. 
 But the class-conscious workers did not. 
 *See pp. 
 209-12 of this volume. 
—Ed. 
 The demonstration took place. 
 All the bourgeois evening newspapers of April 4 were full of it. 
 The next day, April 5, our paper (see Put Pravdy No. 
 55) quoted excerpts from the bourgeois newspapers, which stated that “during the lastfew days large numbers of leaflets signed by the St. 
 Peters-burg Committee of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 were distributed amongthe workers, calling for a demonstration on April 4, theanniversary of the events in the Lena gold-fields”. 
 Our paper could not be prosecuted for publishing this passage from the bourgeois newspapers. 
 The result was thatthe decision of the illegal Party was carried out. 
 A revo-lutionary demonstration was organised, and this work wasbacked by a legal newspaper with a readership of 40,000 workers. 
 And what did the liquidators do? As I have already said, neither during the six months from August 1912 to February 1918, nor during the whole of the ensuing twelve months did a single illegal decision o f the August bloc appear. 
 Nobody heard anything of illegal appeals by the liquida-tors (in connection with April 4, 1914) in St. 
 Petersburg, nor did the bourgeois newspapers mention them. 
 It must besaid that evidence by the bourgeois newspapers is very important , for when leaflets are distributed in really large numbers, the bourgeois newspapers always hear and writeabout it. 
 On the other hand, if leaflets are distributed in insignificant numbers, the masses are not aware of the fact, and the bourgeois newspapers say nothing about it. 
 Thus, the liquidators themselves did nothing to organise the revolutionary demonstration on April 4, 1914. 
 They heldaloof. 
 Moreover, in reporting the demonstration the next day, the legal liquidationist newspaper did not reproduce the information given in the bourgeois newspapers about the distribution of leaflets signed by the St. 
 Petersburg Committee of our Party! This is monstrous, but it is a fact. 
 I attach here a copy of the liquidationist newspaper of April 5, 1914 ( Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta No. 
 48), in order to denounce this fact before the Executive Committee of the International Social-ist Bureau. 
 Just think what this means! People who shout that they want “unity” with our Party, people who claim to be Social-Democrats, conceal from the workers the existence of the illegal organisation of our Party, the St. 
 Petersburg Committee of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
, conceal the factthat the latter issued revolutionary , illegal, underground leaflets, and that it organised the demonstration on April 4, 1914. 
 People who shout about “unity” with our Party refrain from reproducing information published in the bour-geois newspapers about the mass distribution of underground leaflets signed by the St. 
 Petersburg Committee of ourParty! This should help our comrades in the foreign parties to understand why the question of the “underground” is of such vital and cardinal importance to us. 
 But even that is not all. 
 A week later, on April 11, 1914, an article appeared in the liquidationist newspaper ( Sever-naya Rabochaya Gazeta No. 
 51) in which the author sneered at the article published in Pravda of April 4, the day of the demonstration, on the “higher forms” of the struggle, sneered at the fact that Pravda had “clothed its ideas in a form that is difficult to understand ”! Just think: the legal liquidationist newspaper, which is constantly criticising and abusing the “underground” sneers at the fact that our legal newspaper, which desires to help the “underground”, does this only in the form of hints! And for our newspaper’s hint at “higher forms”, i. 
e. 
, at the revolutionary demonstration organised by theSt. 
 Petersburg Committee of our Party, the liquidators pub-licly, in their newspaper, in that very same article, called us“adventurists ” and “most unprincipled adventurists”, “ anar-cho-syndicalists ” “acting as agents provocateurs against the workers”! I have with me all the documents, a copy of the leaflet issued by the St. 
 Petersburg Committee, a copy of our news-paper, and a copy of the liquidationist newspaper. 
 Let thosecomrades who are interested request that these documents be translated for them in full. 
 On behalf of the Central Committee of our Party and of the vast majority of the organised Social-Democratic workers of Russia, I declare: there can be no “unity ” and no “peace ” with this group of liquidators as long as a newspaper like this exists ! We cannot carry on our revolutionary activities among the masses in “unity” with such a newspaper. 
 III I now come to the third part of my report. 
 Having examined the experience of the mass working-class movement in Russia, which has confirmed the correctness of ourline, I now propose to examine the experience of our oppo-nents. 
 Our opponents, both the liquidators and groups abroad, such as Plekhanov’s, like to apply to us the abusive term of “usurpers”. 
 They repeated this abuse in the columns ofVorwärts in March 1912. 
 But Vorwärts did not give us an opportunity of replying! Let us see what political significancethere is in the accusation that we are “usurpers”. 
 I have already said that the 1912 Conference was convened by the Russian Organising Commission which was set up by the Party committees after the liquidators had wreckedthe old Central Committee. 
 We take credit for having re-stored the illegal Party, and the majority of the workers ofRussia have recognised this. 
 But let us assume for a moment that our numerous oppo-nents (numerous in the opinion of the intellectualist groups and the Party groups living abroad) are right. 
 Let us assumethat we are “usurpers”, “splitters”, and so forth. 
 In thatcase, would it not be natural to expect our opponents toprove, not merely with words , but by the experience of their activities and their unity, that we are wrong. 
 If we are wrong in asserting that the Party can only be built up by fighting the liquidationist groups, then shouldwe not expect the groups and organisations which disagreewith us to prove from the experience of their activities that unity with the liquidators is possible? But the experience of our opponents shows this. 
 In Jan-uary 1912, our illegal Party was restored by our Conference, which was representative of the majority of organisations inRussia. 
 In March 1912, the following united in the columns of Vorwärts to abuse us: the liquidators the Bundthe Lettsthe Polesthe Trotskyists and the Vperyodists. 
 What a lot of “trends” and “groups”, one might think! How easy it should have been for them to set the workers of Rus-sia a good example by their unity! But when steps were taken to convene the “August” Con-ference of the liquidators, it was found that our opponents could not march in step. 
 Both the Poles and Plekhanov refused to attend the “August” Conference of the liquidators. 
 Why?Because they could not agree even on the meaning of the term: membership in the Party! And so, when Plekhanov’s group or Rosa Luxemburg or anybody else, assure themselves and others that it is pos-sible to unite with the liquidators, we answer: dear com-rades, you just try yourselves to “unite” with the liquida-tors on a definition of Party membership, not in word , but in deed . 
 Further. 
 The Vperyodists attended the August Conference, but afterwards walked out in protest and denounced it as a fiction. 
 Then, in February 1914, eighteen months after the “August Conference” of the liquidators, the Congress of theLettish Party was held. 
 The Letts had always been in fa-vour of “unity”. 
 The Lettish workers had wanted to work with the liquidators and had proved this not merely inword, but in deed, by experience . 
 And after eighteen months’ experience, the Letts, while remaining strictly neutral , declared at their congress that they were withdrawing from the August bloc because: —as the resolution of the Lettish Congress reads: “The attempt by the conciliators to unite at all costs with the liquidators (the August Conference of 1912) proved fruitless, and the uniters themselves became ideologically and politically dependent upon the liquidators. 
” If anybody else wants to make the “experiment of uniting with the liquidators”, let them do so. 
 We, however, de-clare that until the liquidators definitely abandon theirliquidationist line, unity with them is absolutely impos-sible. 
 Lastly, Trotsky’s group, the Caucasians under their lead-er An, and a number of other liquidators (“Em-El”, for example) have practically dropped out of the August bloc and founded their own journal, Borba . 
 This journal has no connection with the workers whatsoever, but by its veryexistence, by its criticism of the liquidators’ opportunism,by its breakaway from the liquidators, this journal, which belongs to the group of former liquidators, has proved in deed and by experience that unity with the liquidators isimpossible. 
 Unity will be possible only when the liquidators are ready, once and for all, to abandon their entire tactics andcease to be liquidators. 
 I shall now proceed to formulate the precise and formal conditions for such “unity”. 
 IV The following are the practical, concrete conditions, formulated by our Central Committee, which will make “unity” with the liquidators possible for our Party. 
 First : 1. 
 The Party resolutions on liquidationism, adopted in December 1908 and January 1910, shall be confirmed in themost emphatic and unreserved fashion, in application pre-cisely to liquidationism. 
 In order that this confirmation may be accepted by all class-conscious workers in Russia as something really seri-ous and final, and in order that no room may be left forany ambiguity, it shall be agreed that whoever opposes (es-pecially in the legal press) the “underground”, i. 
e. 
, the illegal organisation, calls it a “corpse”, declares it non-existent, that its restoration is a reactionary utopia, andso forth, or, in general, deprecates the role and importance of the “underground”, shall be deemed deserving of condem-nation and shall not be tolerated in the ranks of the illegal R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 It shall be agreed that whoever opposes (especially in the legal press) the “advertising of the illegal press” shallbe deemed deserving of condemnation and shall not be tol-erated in the ranks of the illegal Party. 
 Membership in theillegal Party shall be open only to those who sincerely de-vote all their efforts to promoting the development of the illegal press , the publication of illegal leaflets, and so forth. 
 It shall be agreed that whoever, in any form whatsoever, advocates the formation in present-day Russia of an “open”(i.

 It shall be agreed that whoever, in any form whatsoever, opposes (especially in the legal press) revolutionary massstrikes (i. 
e. 
, strikes which combine the economic and po-litical struggle with revolutionary agitation) and opposes the organisation of revolutionary meetings and street dem-onstrations, shall be deemed deserving of condemnationand shall not be tolerated in the ranks of the illegal Party. 
The banning of attacks against the revolutionary activitiesof the Party, which conducts strikes and demonstrations, shall also apply to condemnation, in the legal press, of the “strike craze” among the workers, or of “higher forms of thestruggle” ( =the legal pseudonym for demonstrations). 
 It shall be agreed that the journal Nasha Zarya and the newspaper Nasha Rabochaya Gazeta are guilty of such devia-tions from the Social-Democratic line towards “bourgeois influence”. 
 2. 
 It shall be agreed that whoever, in any form whatso-ever, declares (especially in the legal press) that the slogansof a democratic republic and confiscation of the landedestates—slogans incorporated in our Party’s programme andparticularly urgent in present-day Russia, where the tsarist monarchy has reduced the tsar’s formal recognition of the constitution to sheer mockery of the people—are useless,or of little use for agitation among the masses, shall be deemed deserving of condemnation and shall not be tolerated in the ranks of the illegal Party. 
 It shall be agreed that whereas the liberal press is broad-casting the idea of reformism, the idea that political freedomis compatible with the existence of the tsarist monarchy,and that the revolutionary overthrow of tsarism is un-necessary, harmful, and sinful—in view of this, agitation fora constitutional reform such as freedom of association must be conducted, and conducted on the widest possible scale, with a clear realisation, however, that the workingclass is hostile to the propaganda of the liberal reformists;and this agitation must be closely combined with the taskof explaining and disseminating the slogan of a republic,as a slogan for the revolutionary onslaught of the masses against the tsarist monarchy. 
 3. 
 It shall be agreed that it is absolutely impermissible and incompatible with membership in the Party for anysection of our Party—the Russian Social-Democratic LabourParty—to enter into a bloc or alliance with any other party. 
 It shall be agreed that the bloc of the Bund and the liquida-tors with the Left-wing of the P.

 Deputy Jagiello, as a member of a non-Social-Democratic party, can be regarded only as being aligned with our Party group in the Duma, but not as a member of that group. 
 4. 
 It shall be agreed that in every city and every locality there shall be only one united Social-Democratic organisa-tion embracing workers of all nationalities, and conductingactivities in all the languages spoken by the local prole-tariat.

 5. 
 It shall be agreed that the demand for “cultural-national autonomy”, which divides the workers according to nationality and is a refined form of nationalism—a demand that was rejected by a formal decision of the Second (1903)Congress of the R.

 Social-Democratic workers of every shade of opinion shall forthwith be called upon by all Party organisations,and by all the Party’s publications in all languages, imme-diately to bring about unity from below, i. 
e. 
, to form local, illegal Social-Democratic units, organisations and centres,or to join such organisations where they already exist. 
 In this connection, the principle of federation, or of equality for all “trends” shall be unreservedly rejected, and the onlyprinciple to be recognised shall be that of loyal submissionof the minority to the majority. 
 The number of financialcontributions made by workers’ groups to the newspapersof the various trends since 1913, as reported in the legal press, shall be taken as the most accurate though approximate index of the alignment of forces among the various trendsin the working-class movement.

 In the matter of defining Party membership, the sole criterion shall be membership in an illegal unit, group,or other organisation (local, factory, district organisation,or Social-Democratic group in some legal society), illegalactivities in organising meetings, discussing Party decisions and distributing illegal literature. 
 All groups and “trends” shall immediately issue abso-lutely clear and definite illegal announcements about this. 
 7. 
 The existence of two rival newspapers in the same town or locality shall be absolutely forbidden. 
 The minority shall have the right to discuss before the whole Party, dis-agreements on programme, tactics and organisation ina discussion journal specially published for the purpose,but shall not have the right to publish, in a rival newspaper,pronouncements disruptive of the actions and decisions ofthe majority. 
 Inasmuch as the liquidators’ newspaper in St. 
 Petersburg, which is supported chiefly by bourgeois, not proletarianfunds, is published contrary to the will of the acknowledgedand indisputable * majority of the class-conscious Social-Democratic workers in St. 
 Petersburg, and causes extremedisorganisation by advocating disregard for the will of the majority, it shall be deemed necessary to close this newspaper immediately and to issue a discussion journalin its place. 
 8. 
 The resolution of the Second Congress of 1903, as well as that of the London Congress of 1907, on the bourgeois-democratic character of the Narodnik trend in general, in-cluding the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, shall be most definitely and unreservedly confirmed. 
 Any blocs, alliances, or temporary agreements between any one section of the Social-Democrats and the Socialist-Revolutionaries (or Narodniks in general) against anothersection of the Social-Democrats, shall be absolutely pro-hibited. 
 The St. 
 Petersburg liquidators, who even at their own “August Conference” proclaimed no new Social-Democraticline towards the Socialist-Revolutionaries, and have beenentering into blocs and agreements with the Socialist-*In their newspaper ( Nasha Rabochaya Gazeta No. 
 34, for June 13, 1914) the liquidators estimate the relative proportion of Prav-dists and liquidators in St. 
 Petersburg at 72 per cent and 28 per cent respectively. 
 This queer calculation is based, not on the number of workers’ groups, but on the sum of money collected from both workersand bourgeois, so that 10,000 workers who contribute 10 kopeks eachare equivalent to one bourgeois who has contributed 1,000 rubles. 
In fact, between January 1 and May 13, 1914, the Pravdists received2,024 contributions from workers’ groups in St. 
 Petersburg, while the liquidators received 308, making the percentages 86 and 14 re-spectively. 
 Revolutionaries against the overwhelming majority of the Social-Democratic workers in St. 
 Petersburg, as was the case during the elections to the Insurance Boards, shall be definitely and unreservedly condemned. 
 A publicists’ bloc shall be forbidden between outstanding liquidators and prominent Social-Democrats belonging togroups that defend the liquidators (Plekhanov, Trotsky,and others), and the Socialist-Revolutionaries who in their St. 
 Petersburg journal Sovremennik assert that “the old cleavage, at all events, has disappeared” and that “it isimpossible to tell where Marxism ends and Narodism begins”. 
( Sovremennik No.

 9. 
 In view of the extreme disorganisation introduced into the working-class movement of Russia by various detached groups abroad, which act without a mandate from any Party organisation in Russia, and without any agreement withsuch an organisation, it shall be deemed necessary to passand put into effect a resolution that all groups residentabroad shall without exception communicate with organi-sations operating in Russia only through the Central Com-mittee of the Party. 
 Groups abroad which do not submit to the Russian centre of Social-Democratic activity, i.

 10. 
 The resolution unanimously adopted at the begin-ning of January 1908 by the London Central Committee shall be deemed absolutely binding on all Social-Demo-crats. 
 The resolution reads: “more vigorous Social-Democratic activity in the trade union movement is prescribed by the entire present situa-tion and must be carried on in keeping with the spirit ofthe London * and Stuttgart ** resolutions, i. 
e. 
, under no circumstances in the spirit of recognising the principle that trade unions are neutral or non-Party, but on the contrary, in the spirit of unswerving effort to establish the closestpossible connection between the trade unions and the Social-Democratic Party.

 The liquidators shall undertake to refrain from calling for insubordination to the executives of the unions, toloyally submit to the Marxist majority of the unions, andunder no circumstances form separatist duplicate unions. 
 The same shall apply to activities in all kinds of workers’ societies—clubs and the like. 
 All Social-Democrats in every union, cultural and edu-cational society and the like, shall join the illegal Social-Democratic unit in the respective organisation. 
 The decisionsof the illegal Party shall be binding on all such groups. 
 It shall be agreed that it is obligatory for all Social-Democrats to oppose the division of the trade unions according to nationality.

 It shall be agreed that newspaper utterances against the representation elected by the St.

, must be forbid-den. 
 It shall be agreed that the insurance programme approved by this workers’ representation is obligatory .

 The six members of the Duma (the Chkheidze group), and also deputy Buryanov, must accept all the above condi-tions. 
 The Chkheidze group must declare from the Duma ros-trum that, in conformity with the Programme of the RussianSocial-Democrats, it withdraws its support of “cultural-national autonomy” (and its pseudonym: “institutions” etc. 
). 
 The Chkheidze group must accept the leadership of the Party’s Central Committee elected at the January Con-ference of 1912, and must recognise as binding all Party deci-sions, and also the Central Committee’s right of veto. 
 Such are the terms on which the Central Committee of our Party considers unity possible, and on which it under-takes to launch a campaign in favour of unity. 
 We considerit utterly impossible to have any negotiations or contacts with the liquidators’ group which publishes Nasha Zarya and Nasha Rabochaya Gazeta , as long as it pursues its present tactics. 
 As far as their political role in the working-classmovement in Russia is concerned; we regard all the othergroups, trends, factions and bodies which defend the liqui-dators or advocate unity or compromise with them, as fictions. 
 We declare that to feed the working class of Russia with verbal assurances and promises that unity with the liqui-dationist group is possible and easy, means rendering verybad service to the cause, and passing off phrases for reality. 
 We therefore make the following practical proposal. 
 A year ago, the question was raised in our Party of con-vening a Party congress. 
 This was announced in the resolu-tions of the 1913 Summer Conference of the Central Com-mittee of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 The arrangements for convening this congress are now almost completed. 
 In all probability, a congress of our Party will be held in the very near future, immediately after the Vienna Congress, or even while it isbeing held. 
 Of course, we ask the comrades not to announcethis or speak of it. 
 If arrests are very numerous, perhaps aconference will be held instead of a congress. 
 Thus, while refraining from any steps towards a rapproche-ment with the liquidationist group or its defenders until the above terms are accepted and carried out , we propose that all groups, trends and factions, which—unlike us—holdthat unity, or peace, or compromise with the presentliquidationist group such as it is, is possible considering itspresent tactics, we propose that these groups should take the opportunity provided by the Vienna Congress to organise a joint formal discussion of our terms. 
 Let those who advocate peace or compromise with the liquidators not confine themselves to propaganda, but provein deed that unity with the present liquidators is possible. 
 For our part, we shall be very glad if we are able to inform the representatives of four-fifths of the workers of Russia gathered at the congress or conference of our Party as tothe outcome of the conference between all groups thatdefend the liquidators, and the liquidationist group. 
 14. 
 In conclusion, I must touch upon one other point which, although very unpleasant, cannot be avoided if we are to have a sincere and frank exchange of opinion on the question of Social-Democratic unity in Russia. 
 The point is the following:In their press, our opponents, the liquidators, are con-ducting a bitter personal campaign against several membersof our Party, accusing them publicly and before the masses, of a host of dishonourable, despicable and criminal actions, or else reporting in their newspaper “rumours” about suchactions. 
 Our Party press replies to these attacks and, in thename of the Central Committee of our Party, plainly anddefinitely calls the liquidators—and especially their twoleaders, Dan and Martov—slanderers. 
 It is not difficult to realise the degree of disorganisation and demoralisation the liquidators are spreading among themasses by this sort of “campaign”, to which we shall always retaliate on the principle “ à corsaire —corsaire et demi ”. 
 We shall briefly quote four examples: 1. 
 In 1911, L. 
 Martov published in Paris a pamphlet entitled Saviours or Destroyers , devoted in the main to accusations against Lenin of having committed dishonour-able and criminal acts. 
 Martov sent a German translationof this pamphlet to Kautsky, who was then acting as arbi-ter in a controversial question affecting Russian Social-Democracy. 
 In a letter to Lunacharsky (of the Vperyod group) Kautsky described Martov’s pamphlet as “disgust-ing”, and this opinion was published in the Russian Social-Democratic press by Plekhanov. 
 The liquidators’ news-paper is now beginning, in the form of insinuations,gradually to spread the contents of this pamphlet among the Russian public. 
 2. 
 Since 1913 the liquidators’ newspaper has been constant-ly accusing Dansky, a member of our Party and an insuranceexpert, of dishonesty. 
 The pretext for these accusations isthat Dansky works for an employers’ organisation, thusserving the bourgeoisie. 
 Our Party, as represented by a num-ber of bodies (the editorial boards of Pravda and Prosve-shcheniye , the Russian Social-Democratic Labour group in the Duma, several trade unions, etc. 
), examined these accu-sations and found that Dansky had gradually given upworking for the employers and was serving the working-class movement, beginning as anonymous contributor to Pravda . 
 When Dansky definitely joined our Party he was requested, in conformity with the resolutions of our Party,to sever all connections with the employers’ organisation. 
Dansky did so and gave up his job. 
 On behalf of the CentralCommittee, I repeat that our Party regards this man as anhonest comrade, and it will not permit anybody to besmirch his honour with impunity. 
 Our press, in accusing the liqui-dators of slandering Dansky, pointed out that in this casethe liquidators were particularly dishonest, because Martovhimself constantly writes for a bourgeois newspaper undera different pseudonym (here I will fully reveal the fact:Yegorov , in Kievskaya Mysl ); Yezhov , one of the closest collaborators of the liquidationist newspaper, was on the staff of an employers’ association, as was, or is, also the casewith Yermansky . 
 3. 
 Malinovsky, a Duma member, suddenly left the Duma and resigned without giving any reason. 
 Our workers called together their local and central leading bodies and sentenced Malinovsky to expulsion from the Party, describing hisunexplained resignation without consultation with his col-leagues as disruptive, and as desertion from his post. 
 Theliquidationist newspaper then began to publish anonymousrumours to the effect that Malinovsky was an agent provoca-teur, and demanded a joint investigation by the different groups. 
 Our Central Committee declared that it vouched forMalinovsky, had investigated the rumours, and was con-vinced that Dan and Martov were indulging in base slander. 
The Central Committee rejected the proposal for a jointcommission with the liquidators and, following on the opin-ion expressed by the representatives of ten trade unions in Moscow, denounced as slanderers those people who dared topublish in the press anonymous “ rumours ” about agents provocateurs, instead of submitting these rumours in anorganised manner to our Central Committee, or to their own Central Committee (their “O. 
C. 
”), to the Bund and to groups that trust the liquidators, to have them investigated by boards and responsible bodies. 
 Burtsev declared that he did not believe the rumours. 
 The Committee of Investigationset up by our Central Committee declared that it wouldpublish the facts about those who were circulating theserumours. 
 I can only add that these rumours were circulated by the liquidators . 
 4. 
 Some days ago the liquidationist newspaper published an open letter from ex-member of the Second Duma Ale-xinsky, accusing Comrade Antonov, a member of our Partywho had served a term of penal servitude, of being a traitor. 
But Comrade Antonov’s conduct was pronounced unimpeach-able both by a special committee consisting of comrades who had served sentence with him, as well as by a decision ofthe Central Committee of the Party adopted in 1907-08 inFinland, when the Mensheviks (i. 
e. 
, the present liquidators)and all the “national organisations” were represented on theCentral Committee. 
 The answer given in our press is again tantamount to accusing Dan and Martov of spreading slander. 
 On instructions from the Central Committee, I must sub-mit to the Executive Committee of the International Social-ist Bureau the following practical proposal on this matter. 
 We regard the liquidators’ procedure as a specific method of political struggle used by people who have been expelled from the Party. 
 We therefore harbour no hope that thismatter can be “rectified” with the aid of moral precepts. 
 Butwhen bodies which screen the liquidators (the “O. 
C. 
” andthe Bund, for example, as well as Trotsky), and the numerousgroups abroad (including Plekhanov) talk to us about “ unity ” with these liquidators, we make them the following proposal before the Executive Committee of the International Social-ist Bureau: let them declare openly and publicly, without equivo-cation, whether they approve or disapprove of the liquida-tors’ “campaign” on all the four points enumerated (to which we are sure the liquidators will add another 44). 
 If they disapprove, let the workers of Russia know it. 
If they approve, let all groups that offer us “unity” or compromise with the liquidators elect a joint commissionand formulate a reasoned, business-like, and open charge ofdishonest conduct against certain members of our Party. 
 We shall submit this charge to our Party congress and invite representatives of this commission of all groups whichdefend the liquidators to attend our congress and producetheir evidence. 
 We deem it our duty to declare that if this is not done, it will strengthen the opinion, already being expressed in the ranks of our Party, that all groups that advocate “unity” with the liquidators are tacitly supporting the slanderers. 
 In the name of the majority of the class-conscious workers of Russia, we shall defend the organisation of our Partyfrom the disruptors, and we shall recognise no means ofdefence other than those we have applied, and which I have enumerated above (not to mention the bourgeois law court, to which we shall resort at the first opportunity). 
 The report I have been instructed to make on behalf of the Central Committee of the Russian Social-DemocraticLabour Party is finished. 
 Permit me to sum up in two brieftheses: Formally, the situation is as follows. 
 Our Party, which was restored at the January 1912 Conference in the teeth of theresistance from the liquidators’ group, expelled that group. 
 After this, after two-and-a-half years of the movement, the overwhelming majority, of the class-conscious workers of Russia have approved of our Party line. 
 We therefore have every reason to be convinced more firmly than ever that ourline is correct, and we shall not depart from it . 
 If the liqui-dators and the groups defending them want us to rescind theresolution expelling the liquidators from the Party, our Cen-tral Committee is prepared to submit a motion to that effect to our Party congress and to support it only on the terms I have mentioned. 
 Materially, i. 
e. 
, in substance, the position is as follows. 
 Russia is passing through a period of bourgeois revolutions,during which small and unstable groups of intellectualsare sometimes inclined to regard themselves as Social-Democrats, or to support the opportunist trend in the So-cial-Democratic movement, which our Party has beenfighting against for the past twenty years (Economism in1895-1902, Menshevism in 1903-08, and liquidationism in1908-14). 
 The experience of the August (1912) bloc ofliquidators and its break-down have shown that the liquida-tors and their defenders are absolutely incapable of forming any kind of party or organisation. 
 The genuine workers’Social-Democratic Party of Russia which, in spite of enor-mous difficulties, has already united eight-tenths of the class-conscious workers (counting only Social-Democrats) orseven-tenths (counting Social-Democrats and Socialist-Revolutionaries) can be built up, and is being built up, only in the struggle against these groups. 
 Appendix INSTRUCTIONS I. 
 NOTES PRIVÉES On the question as to the connection existing between the figures on whether the majority or the minority ofworkers follow the lead of the Pravdists, or rather, are themselves Pravdists, in Russia, and the question of “unity”, it should be noted: 1. 
 If a party or group definitely and concretely advances a programme or tactics with which our Party cannot agreein principle, then the question of a majority is of course ofno significance. 
 If, for example, the Socialist-Revolutionary Party (Left Narodniks), whose programme and tactics differ from ours, were to win over the majority of workers in Rus-sia, that would not in the least induce us to depart from ourline. 
 The same applies to the straightforward and definiterepudiation of the “underground” ( =illegal Party) in pres-ent-day Russia. 
 However, certain Social-Democratic groups and some liquidators assert that there are no irreconcilable disagree-ments on principle between us. 
 We are obliged to point outtheir inconsistency to these groups and individuals, whenthey refuse to submit to the majority. 
 2. 
 We have been convinced of the correctness of our line on tactics and organisation primarily by our long years of acquaintance with the workers’ Social-Democratic movementin Russia, and by our participation in it, as well as by ourtheoretical Marxist convictions. 
 But we are of the opinionthat the practical experience of the mass working-class movement is no less important than theory, and that this experience alone can serve as a serious test of our principles. 
 “Theory, my friend, is grey, but the tree of life is eternallygreen” (Faust). 
 Therefore, the fact that, after two-and-a-half years of struggle against liquidationism and its allies, four-fifths of the class-conscious workers have expressed them-selves in favour of Pravdism, strengthens our conviction that our line is correct and makes this conviction un-shakable. 
 3. 
 In Russia, nearly every group, or “faction” (to use the old terminology), accuses the other of being not a workers’ group, but a bourgeois intellectualist group. 
 We consider this accusation or rather argument, this reference to the social significance of a particular group, extremely important in principle . 
 But precisely because we consider it extremely important, we deem it our duty not to make sweeping state-ments about the social significance of other groups, but toback our statements with objective facts. 
 For the objective facts prove absolutely and irrefutably that Pravdism alone is a workers ’ trend in Russia, whereas liquidationism and Socialist-Revolutionism are in fact bourgeois intellectual-ist trends. 
 II. 
 NOTES PRIVÉES Should an attempt be made (whether by any member of the International Socialist Bureau, or by our opponents)to “dismiss” or set aside the evidence, the objective proofs, that we are the majority, then be sure to ask for the floorso as to make a formal statement on behalf of the entire delegation and enter a formal protest of the following na-ture: We categorically protest against the statement (or hints, inferences, etc. 
) that our objective evidence as to the sidewhich the overwhelming majority of the class-consciousworkers of Russia are supporting, cannot be examined by the Executive Committee on the grounds that it has not veri-fied them (or on the grounds that they are irrelevant to thequestion of unity). 
 On the contrary, we consider that it is inthe indubitable interest of the entire International, and inaccordance with the will of the International SocialistBureau, as clearly expressed in the resolution of the I. 
S. 
B. 
 (December 1913), to receive the fullest, most precise, and documented information on the actual state of the working-class movement in Russia. 
 We are of the opinion that our opponents, who are aware of the December decision of the I. 
S. 
B. 
, have failed to per-form their duty in not yet having independently col-lected objective data on the working-class movement inRussia. 
 We declare that after Comrade Vandervelde’s successful visit to Russia, there cannot be the slightest doubt that theExecutive Committee of the I. 
S. 
B. 
 could, through Comrade Vandervelde, quite legally have addressed an open letter to the editors of all the working-class (or would-be working-class) newspapers in Russia, and to all the members of theexecutives of all the legal workers’ societies in Russia,for the purpose of obtaining from direct sources data show-ing how the class-conscious workers of Russia are divided into Pravdists, liquidators, Socialist-Revolutionaries (Left Narodniks), and other trends. 
 Without such objective data, the subjective statements of the representatives of individual “groups” are entirelyworthless. 
 III. 
 NOT FOR THE REPORT Judging from certain fragmentary statements by the liquidators at the Lettish Congress and from hints in thepress, one of the fraudulent plans for “unity” they proposeis that of a “general congress”. 
 This plan, whose obvious object is to dupe credulous foreigners, is roughly as follows: either set up a “federated” organising committee for the purpose of convening a generalcongress, or “supplement” the Central Committee of ourParty with representatives of one of the liquidationist organi-sations for the purpose of convening this congress. 
 In whatever the form it is presented, this plan is wholly unacceptable to us, and if it nevertheless comes up at the “conference” in Brussels, our delegation of the Central Com-mittee must declare the following: It is absolutely impossible for us to take any step towards a general congress or federation, or even towards the slight-est rapprochement, until the liquidators’ group complies with the terms we propose. 
 For unless that group fulfils these terms, it will be impossible for us to place the slightest confidence in the liquidators’ group which has been expelled /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR from the Party, and, in its paper, is daily continuing its disruptive activities. 
 If we placed any confidence in this group, it would encour-age it to continue its disruptive work. 
 On the basis of decisions of our congresses, conferences and our CentralCommittee, we demand the cessation of these activities of the liquidators as a canditio sine qua non of “peace”. 
 The fact that the liquidators are shielded by groups or organisations which have not been formally expelled from the Party (for example, the Bund, or the Caucasian RegionalBureau, or the six deputies, etc. 
) does not in the leastalter the case. 
 As far as work in Russia is concerned, only one thing really matters, i. 
e. 
, that this group of liquidatorsand their newspaper advocate flouting the will of the ma-jority. 
 Let the Bund, Chkheidze’s six deputies and the others— or the Caucasian Regional Committee, or Trotsky, or theO. 
C. 
, or anybody else who desires rapprochement with us,first of all induce the liquidators’ group to accept our terms, or else emphatically condemn it and break with it. 
 Unless this is done, we cannot take the slightest step that might in any way indicate confidence in the liquidators’ group. 
 Let those who really want to see Russian Social-Democracy united harbour no illusions and yield to no subjectiveassurances, promises and the like. 
 There is one and onlyone way to unity, and that is to induce the minority which has left the illegal Party and is trying to thwart and dis-rupt its activities and the will of the majority, to abandonits present practices and prove in deed that it is willing to respect the will of the majority. 
 No direct or indirect encouragement of the liquidators’ group in its present conduct, or attempts to inspire it with hopes of the possibility of “federation”, “conciliation”, a “general congress”,”rapprochement”, or the like with thatgroup, as long as it continues its present activities and refuses to submit in deed to the will of the majority, will lead to anything. 
 The Party of the Social-Democratic work-ers in Russia, which unites four-fifths of the class-conscious workers, will not allow its will to be thwarted. 
 Let those groups or bodies which “assure” themselves and others that the liquidators are not so bad (the Bund, the O. 
C. 
, the Caucasian Regional Committee) realise that we want not words but deeds. 
 If they trust the liquidators let them organise their own congress with them, submit our terms to that congress, and induce the liquidators to give afavourable reply to these terms and faithfully carry themout. 
 We shall wait and see the results; we shall wait andsee their actions ; we shall not believe promises. 
 Only after our terms have been faithfully complied with wiII a general congress, and steps towards it, be possible. 
 Our foreign socialist comrades are sometimes most sadly mistaken when they think that the cause of unity can be pro-moted by inspiring the liquidators with the hope that wewill agree to co-operate with them even if they do not com-pletely and radically change their conduct, and even if they do not submit to the will of the majority. 
 Objectively, such tactics amount to helping, not the cause of unity, butthe splitters. 
 Our terms constitute a draft of a pacte d’unité , and until this pact is signed by the liquidators and until they havecarried it out in practice, there can be no talk of taking any steps towards a rapprochement.

 If it arrives it should be used to supplementthe documents of the report. 
 We do not assert that the liquidators never issued leaflets. 
 They had one in May 1913 (the Vienna leaflet); in 1914, the St. 
 Petersburg people say , they had none. 
 They are said to have had one about the strike. 
 But 4.

 1914 is a typical case of the wrecking of illegal work. 
 If Plekhanov or Rubanovich wish to ask publicly wheth-er we vote for their attendance, I would reply: “We would vote against , because Rubanovich is not a Social-Democrat, and Plekhanov does not represent anything in Russia. 
 But *See pp. 
 509-13 of this volume.

 since our report contains a direct attack on Plekhanov’s group and Rubanovich’s trend, we do not wish to vote against, and shall abstain . 
 Guarantees for the minority?— we may be asked. 
 “No, we can discuss no guarantees whatever either with the group of liquidators expelled from the Party, or con-cerning that group. 
 We ourselves demand guarantees fromthe liquidators and their friends.

 They themselves left on account of the liquidators. 
 Tant pis pour eux ! Fight with all our might to have the Conference Minutes published. 
 Submit a written protest in the event of refusal (in case of a general refusal, demand that our resolutions bepublished— we shall publish them in any case —as well as counter-resolutions (the Executive Committee may elimi-nate personal attacks)).

 promising to submit the “counter-proposals” of our dear comrades to our congress. 
 The most important thing is to emphasise (best of all in a reply) that our “terms” were in the main published long ago by the workers . 
 I am sending Popov the appropriate issues of Pravda . 
 What procedure is desirable, from our point of view, for the conference in Brussels? First, the reports of all organisations and groups—this will take up a fairly long time. 
 Then brief comments followed by a formulation of concrete proposals made by all organisations and groups. 
 When all the participants at the conference have formu-lated their concrete proposals, each of them should expresshis opinion whether he considers these proposals a basis for possible further steps towards a rapprochement or talks on rapprochement, or, if he considers that impossible, he will submit all the proposals to his organisation. 
 Clearly, we, in any case , shall not accept the pro-posals of the liquidators, the Bund, Rosa and Plekhanov(as well as of Kautsky and Vandervelde), and shall submitthem to our congress or conference. 
 Our task is only to make our terms clear, make a note of “their” terms, and walk out. 
 Are not our terms in the nature of an ultimatum?—we may be asked. 
 They are not. 
 We shall see what counter-proposals are made to us before saying whether we agree tocontinued talks on this basis or not (we should let everyone have his say, ask everyone for counter-proposals on all questions, and go away. 
 Voilà notre programme ! Should Polish affairs be kept apart from Russian? I think we ought to be opposed to separation. 
 We shall con-sult our Polish comrade on this. 
 Obviously, people will go out of their way to attack us for our “monstrous” demands. 
 We should calmly refer to the resolutions of our conferences and meetings and the reso-lutions on unity adopted by the St. 
 Petersburg, Moscow, Caucasian and other comrades. 
 I shall send a collection of them. 
 We sum up the opinions of our organisations. 
 If any-body chooses to disregard them, that is their business. 
 Nous n’y pouvons rien . 
 According to the liquidators’ newspaper, Vandervelde threw out a feeler in St. 
 Petersburg as to whether we wouldagree to the Executive Committee acting, not as mediator but as arbiter , that is, as supreme “judge” in our disagree-ments. 
 The answer is this. 
 When Bebel proposed this in 1905 our congress rejected it with thanks, declaring that we werean autonomous party. 
” 217 I think today our congress will give the same reply. 
 (Such, at any rate, is the opinion of theCentral Committee. 
) On “slanderous” affairs “they” will probably propose a general withdrawal of all accusations . 
 Ask this to be put to the vote! We are against . 
 We shall submit their proposal to our congress. 
 (They will be in a proper mess if they makeand carry through such a proposal. 
) [[We do not equate theguilt of a spreader of slander with the conduct of a person who has called a slanderer a slanderer. 
]] Generally speaking, there is no doubt that “they” will all seek “half-way” and “conciliatory” formulas. 
 We shallpoint out that this attempt was made with regard to us inJanuary 1910 and with regard to the Letts in August 1912,and we shall not repeat it . 
 Let the conference divide into two clear camps: those who consider rapprochement with the present liquidators possible, and those who turn down the idea of rapprochement unless the liquidators radically change their tactics and behaviour . 
 “Conciliatory” formulas should be carefully recorded (this is most important), then slightly criticised, and——every-thing rejected. 
 HOW THE WORKERS RESPONDED TO THE FORMATION OF THE RUSSIAN SOCIAL -DEMOCRATIC LABOUR GROU P IN THE DUM A218 It was natural that the open struggle against the liqui-dators should flare up more strongly than ever with the formation of the independent Russian Social-Democratic Labour group in the Duma. 
 A more convenient and plaus-ible excuse for the liquidators of the Party (and for theirovert and covert defenders) to shout about “unity”could not be imagined. 
 From the point of view of the man inthe street, the whole issue would seem to centre on the ques-tion whether one or two Duma groups want to call them-selves Social-Democratic. 
 As to whose will one or the other group is carrying out, what decisions the majority of theclass-conscious and organised workers have adopted, orwhat is the “underground”—the man in the street isincapable of grasping this, and indeed shrinks fromdoing so. 
 Therefore, if there was any point on which the liquidators could count on the sympathy of the man in the street andphilistines, who do not care a hang about parties, it wasprecisely on the point of what is known as the “split ” in the Social-Democratic group in the Duma. 
 The outcries fromphilistines who would call themselves Social-Democrats have never been so loud and so piteous. 
 The open nature of all these events made it much easier for the workers andthe public at large to appraise them, and Pravda , in unison with the liquidators’ newspaper, has called upon the class-conscious proletariat to express its opinion. 
 Letters, statements and resolutions from workers have begun to fill the columns of both newspapers. 
 Many months have passed since the independent Russian Social-Democratic Labour group in the Duma was formed (at the end of October 1913). 
 The campaign of resolutions in the respective newspapers, in favour of the Six (Rus-sian Social-Democratic Labour group) or of the Seven (theliquidators) is now over. 
 The question arises, what are the results of this campaign?On this point we have first of all the following statement by Mr. 
 L. 
 Martov in Nasha Zarya No. 
 10-11: “What,” writes Mr. 
 L. 
 Martov, “was the proletariat’s attitude towards the split in the Duma group which it had come to look up as a united whole? It is difficult [!?] to judge of this from the figuresgiven in the press. 
 Over ten thousand workers expressed their opinionon this question in Novaya Rabochaya Gazeta and in Za Pravdu . 
 Of this number, slightly more than half [italics ours] approved of the way the Six had acted. 
 But the significance of this preponderance is diminished [listen to this!] by the fact that opposition to the split and, consequently, support for the majority in the Social-DemocraticDuma group, was expressed by numerous Party groups, includingseveral which unite a relatively large number of workers. 
” ( Nasha Zarya , 1913, No. 
 10-11, p. 
 97. 
) So much for Mr. 
 Martov’s argument, which for the thou-sandth time glaringly reveals the truly Burenin methods219 he employs in distorting the truth! “Slightly more thanhalf”! Can anything be more evasive? Fifty-one and ninety-nine out of a hundred would both be “slightly more than half”. 
 How can the preponderance be “diminished” by the fact that there were numerous Party groups? In the first place, no figures are given. 
 The term “numerous” can be interpret-ed in whatever way one pleases. 
 One would thinkMr. 
 Martov had deliberately invented the term in order toconceal the truth. 
 Secondly, and most important : if it is true that numerous Party groups are supported by a minority of the workers, then it is obvious that these groups are fictitious , for only the totally uninformed or inattentive reader will believe Mr. 
 L. 
 Martov’s suggestion that it ispossible for a non-fictitious group to fail to collect in a news-paper the opinions of all the workers it represents on an important and burning issue. 
 Mr. 
 L. 
 Martov has overreached himself. 
 He has not only admitted that the majority of the workers have condemned the liquidationist section of the Duma Social-Democratic group, i. 
e. 
, the Seven, but also that the liquidators claim to have groups which are actually fictitious and are not supported by the workers. 
 While acknowledging defeat, Mr. 
 Martov, by his reference to fictitious “groups”, tried to conceal, à la Burenin, the magnitude of this defeat. 
 And that is the crux of the matter. 
 As regards the magnitude of this defeat, exact figures were published and reported to Martov’s friends at the meeting of the International Socialist Bureau as far back as December 1 (14), 1913! Why did not the liquidators ever say a single word in the press about these figures? Was it because their conscience was not clear? These figures gave the results up to November 20, 1913. 
 Only the signatures attached to pronouncements by workers were taken, i. 
e. 
, data of the most precise kind, which have never been challenged. 
 These figures show 4,850 signatures in favour of the Six, and only 2,539 (of which1,086 came from the Bund and 636 from the Caucasus) infavour of the liquidators, i. 
e. 
, of the Seven. 
 Now ask yourselves how the methods of a writer should be qualified who tries to assure the public that the prepon-derance of the opponents of liquidationism is “diminished”by the fact that there were “numerous” (fictitious) groups,which together succeeded in obtaining all over Russia the support of only one-third of the workers who expressed their opinions! Below we give the number of signatures attached to definitely expressed resolutions published in both newspapersduring the whole period of the campaign (which ended at the beginning of January); Number of signatures to published resolutions and statements In favour In favour Total of the Six (of of the Seven the Party) (of the liquidators) St.

 They have been taken from both rival newspa-pers, and any literate person can verify our calculation, andmake his own. 
 These figures give us a highly illuminating picture of the state of Party affairs among Marxists in Russia. 
 No other political party in Russia can show, for the whole period ofthe counter-revolution in general and for 1913 in particular,a similar open and mass opinion poll of all its members on a most important issue of Party life. 
 None of the legalisedparties in Russia, none of the wealthy liberal and democratic parties, which have a host of intellectualist forces and all sorts of publications at their command, has done as much asthe party of the working class, the party of propertylessproletarians, who have been driven underground and main-tain their newspaper with the kopeks they collect. 
 The workers’ party has set all parties in Russia an example of how the masses of the rank-and-file members should be drawn into an open and all-round discussion of controversialissues. 
 The liberals and philistines of all parties, of all agesand of all types, are fond of bewailing the “splits” in the ranksof the Social-Democrats. 
 These good souls do not realisethat it is impossible to carry out the will of the majority without a struggle; and unless the will of the majority is carried out there is no use talking about the Party spirit, oreven of organised political action in general. 
 By “unity”, foolish people mean a “system” under which thirteen members of the Duma act in defiance of the will of the majority of the organised and class-conscious Marxist workers of Russia; by a “split” they mean the formation, by the six Duma members, of an independent group acting in harmony with this majority of workers, with the purpose of carrying out its will. 
 Do not these foolish people cut a ridiculous figure? Are they not contemptible? It should now be clear to everybody, except to those who are out to deceive the workers, that the much bruited “unity”of the thirteen deputies (about which the liquidators and conciliators talk so much) was actually the flouting of the will of the Party, mockery of the will of the majority of the workers. 
 And vice versa. 
 Consider the matter from another angle. 
 No person in his right mind has ever attempted to questionthe fact that in the summer of 1913 a conference of Marxists(far from open ) was held, whose decision, endorsed by the leading body of the Party, became the Party’s will and decision. 
 This decision demanded that the Six should act independently. 
 * You vilify this conference, Messrs. 
 liquidators and conciliators? You call it a circle, a packedmeeting, a piece of fiction, etc. 
? Very well! But your abuseonly expresses your impotence, for the objective facts areindisputable: by a decision of this “circle”, two-thirds of the class-conscious workers of Russia came out to the man in favour of the conference, in favour of carrying out its will. 
 This is precisely what we call a party , you gentlemen who babble about “unity”, but, by “unity”, mean permitting the liquidators to flout the will of the Party. 
 Note that with two rival dailies there could be no question of anybody trying to prevent even a single class-conscious worker from expressing his opinion if he desiredto do so. 
 As it turned out, less than a third supported theliquidators; and of the total number of votes cast for theliquidators, more than half came from the Bund and the Caucasus. 
 Moreover, the figures we have quoted contain hardly any signatures of Lettish workers (there were 98 signatures for the Six and 70 for the liquidators, whereas,among the Lettish workers who voted on this question with-out giving their signatures, 863 voted for the Six and 347for the liquidators); nor do they contain the votes of over 800 Polish Social-Democratic workers who also voted for the Six but did not give their signatures (in the same way,about 400 supporters of the Left wing voted for the liqui-dators).

 WHAT IS SHOWN BY THE ACTIVITIES OF THE TWO GROUPS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER We cannot dwell here upon the political content of these activities. 
 This most interesting question of how the activitiesof the Six have gained from the needs, demands, views and will of the majority of the workers now being proclaimed from the Duma rostrum must regretfully be left for another occasion. 
 We shall merely state briefly that in the speeches they delivered on March 4, 1914, Badayev and Malinovsky,spokesmen of the Six in the Duma, formulated for the first time the question of freedom of the press, not in a liberal manner, but in a manner worthy of the proletariat,whereas the liquidators, both in the literary world and in the columns of their newspapers, as well as in the speeches delivered in the Duma by their Seven flounderedon this question in a purely liberal manner. 
 One may readin Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta of as recent a date as March 13, on p. 
 2 of that issue, an argument to the effect that“advertising the illegal press can only weaken the workers’ struggle for their legal press”. 
 How important it was in principle to form an independent Russian Social-Democratic Labour group in the Duma to combat shameful renegadestatements and opinions of the kind just quoted, has al-ready been stressed in this volume and will be stressed againmore than once. 
 For the moment, we shall undertake the more modest task of drawing our readers’ attention to the “external”, ifone may so express it, evidence showing what the Russian Social-Democratic Labour group in the Duma at once becameas distinct from the seven liquidators. 
 Each Duma group publishes in its newspaper the finan-cial reports of its treasurer, showing the sums that have passed through its hands. 
 These sums, designated for therelief of comrades in prison or in exile, for aid to strikers indifferent factories and industries, and for various otherneeds of the working-class movement, reveal to us a numberof aspects of working-class life ; they strikingly reveal—by exact, indisputable and impartial figures—what links each of the groups in the Duma has with the working-classmovement. 
 In both newspapers and in both Duma groups, the latest report of this kind covers the period up to January 21, 1914. 
 Thus, we have reports for only three months of the period during which the two groups have existed separately, viz. 
from the end of October to the end of January. 
 The follow-ing is a summary of the reports of the two groups for thequarter mentioned: Collections handled by the Duma groups (in rubles ) Total From non-From Number of collections workers workers workers’ groups 1) By the R .

 The number of workers’ groups which ad-dressed the Duma group of liquidators during the quarter isalmost one-eighth of the number that addressed the Duma group of Party men. 
 *The above figures cover the period only up to January 21, 1914 (from the time the Russian Social-Democratic Labour groupwas formed, i. 
e. 
, from the end of October 1913). 
 We consider it our duty to quote fuller figures from the calcula-tions made by Comrade V. 
A. 
T. 
 for the whole period beginning from the formation of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour group to June 1914. 
 The following are the figures (in rubles) of the collections (for relief for comrades in prison or in exile, etc. 
), which, according toreports in the Marxist and liquidationist newspapers, were handledby the respective Duma groups between October 1913 and June 6, 1914: Total From non-From Number of collections workers workers workers’ groups By the R.

83 215 The Russian Social-Democratic Labour group received from non-workers six per cent of the total sum collected, whereas the liquida-tionist (“S. 
D. 
”) group received 46 per cent from this source. 
 Thenumber of workers’ groups that addressed the Russian Social-Demo-cratic Labour group is 85. 
7 per cent of the total (1,295 out of 1,510),while the number that addressed the “S. 
D. 
” group is 14. 
3 per cent ofthe total. 
 On the other hand, the amount received by the liquidation-ist group from non-workers * is ten times as much as that received by the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
 group from this source: 765 rubles as against 71 rubles. 
 Collections from non-workers * received by the Party men are one per cent of the total sum collected (71 rubles out of 6,173 rubles). 
 Collections from this sourcereceived by the liquidators are thirty-four per cent of the total sum collected (765 rubles out of 2,213 rubles). 
 These figures enable the general public, who are unfamil-iar with the activities of the Duma groups, to weigh upexactly and give thorough thought to facts which peoplefamiliar with the life of the groups have gleaned from a thou-sand and one “trifles” of everyday life, namely: that the liquidationist group (the Seven) is a group with-out workers. 
 that the liquidationist group has thirty times as many contacts with non-worker circles than the Russian Social-Democratic Labour group. 
 These facts were commented on long ago and from differ-ent angles. 
 The liberal newspaper Rech rightly called the liquidationist group a group of “intellectuals”, and the entire liberal press has endorsed this over and over again. 
 Plekha-nov long ago pointed out that the liquidators have taken intotheir ranks quite a number of petty-bourgeois opportunistelements, in addition to Mr. 
 Potresov. 
 The numerous contri-butors to liberal newspapers in the ranks of the liquidators and vice versa (Enzis, Yegorov, S. 
 Novich, Y. 
 Smirnov, Antid Oto, Nevedomsky, Lvov-Rogachevsky, Chereva-nin, 220 and many others) have been named by Put Pravdy . 
 In point of social significance, the liquidators are essen-tially a branch of the liberal-bourgeois party, whose aim isto instil into the proletarian midst the ideas of liberal-labour policy and to flout the will of the majority of the organised and class-conscious workers of Russia.

 CLARITY FIRST AND FOREMOST! (ON THE QUESTION OF UNITY) 1. 
 PEOPLE HOLDING TWO OPINIONS Can people obviously incapable of taking serious problems seriously, themselves he taken seriously? It is difficult todo so, comrades, very difficult! But the question which cer-tain people cannot treat seriously is in itself so serious thatit will do no harm to examine even patently frivolous re-plies to it. 
 This serious question is that of the unity of the Russian working-class movement. 
 Contributors to Yedinstvo are people incapable of treating this question seriously. 
 Here is the first example. 
 In issue No. 
 4, Yedinstvo has published an interview with deputy Chkheidze. 
 The editorsof Yedinstvo have expressed the hope that this interview will help “to unite the Russian working class”. 
 Very good. 
 But let us see what Chkheidze has said about the organi-sational and tactical questions that interest the Russianworkers. 
 Chkheidze has expressed himself as follows: “I am personally in full agreement with the views on tactics and organisation lately expounded in the press by Com-rade An. 
” What views has Comrade An lately expounded in the press? What, for example, has he said about the views of the Luchists, alias the liquidators? An, a prominent Menshevik and opponent of Pravdism, “has lately expounded in the press” the view that “the liqui-dators are steering a course towards reforms”, that their views on the “underground”, strikes, “uncurtailed slo-gans”, and so forth, are inseparably connected with their general reformism; that if the workers heeded their advice, the workers in the provinces would have to refrain from or-ganising strikes, and so forth. 
 These views have indicated that An is beginning to free himself from captivity to the liquidators, and we havewelcomed this. 
 Now Chkheidze says that he is “in full” agreement with these views. 
 We are very glad to hear it. 
 An understandingof the nature of liquidationism and emphatic renuncia-tion of it is the beginning of wisdom, is it not? Andwe would be ready to welcome deputy Chkheidze’s long-delayed awakening to the role played by liquidationism as a trend. 
 But serious questions should be treated seriously, and it will be useful therefore to examine, not only Chkheidze’sstatements in Yedinstvo , but his actions as well. 
 The reply of the Social-Democratic Duma group (of which deputy Chkheidze is chairman) to the terms of unity proposed by the Russian Social-Democratic Labour group might have been of vast importance to the cause of unity. 
 That reply appeared not very long ago in Nasha Rabo-chaya Gazeta , issue No. 
 2, in the form of an appeal to the workers. 
 In this appeal to the workers, deputy Chkheidze and his fellow-thinkers reply, among others, to the question of theirattitude towards liquidationism as represented by the lat-ter’s organ, at that time Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta . 
 “As for the Marxist Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta ,” deputy Chkheidze and his friends write, “our attitude towards it can be defined as com-plete solidarity with this trend . 
” Thus, in an official appeal to the workers, deputy Chkheidze has announced his “ complete solidarity ” with the trend of the liquidationist newspaper, and in the interview pub-lished in Yedinstvo he has stated that he is in “ full agreement ” with the views of An, who has criticised this newspaper as an organ of the reformists who are hampering the present-dayworking-class movement. 
 Is such a thing permissible? Does this indicate a serious attitude towards a serious question? Has deputy Chkheidze anything serious to say on the question of unity with the liquidators, considering that in the space of two monthshe has contrived to express two diametrically opposite viewson the liquidators? But, we may be told, when the “Open Reply of the Social-Democratic Group” was being drafted, deputy Chkheidze was probably not yet aware of An’s views, and was there-fore unable as yet to appreciate the significance of liquida-tionism. 
 Alas, this will not be in keeping with the truth, for An’s article was published long before the “Open Reply” ap-peared. 
 Another thing that must be borne in mind is this. 
 Several days after An’s articles appeared, L. 
 M. 
 in Sever-naya Rabochaya Gazeta , came out strongly in defence of the liquidators against An’s criticism. 
 And what aboutChkheidze? Did he utter a single word in defence of viewswith which he now appears to be in “full agreement”? No. 
 Chkheidze kept quiet, while deputy Tulyakov, a fellow-member of his group, chose that very moment to come for-ward as publisher of Nasha Rabochaya Gazeta .... 
 We repeat: is it permissible for the Chairman of the Social-Democratic group in the Duma to adopt such anattitude towards a question that is agitating the broad masses of the workers and has been repeatedly discussed at meetings, conferences, etc. 
? Has Chkheidze made any con-tribution to the solution of the problem of unity? Is thisnot an attempt to obscure the question of unity by meansof parochial diplomatic considerations designed to save theliquidators? This is the common failing of our “uniters”: they cannot give a clear answer to questions of the day; they do not them-selves know what they want. 
 One thing is clear from their writings: they want to save the liquidators, and must therefore avoid clarity and pre-cision in the formulation and solution of problems. 
 To the liquidators clarity and precision are the most dan-gerous things at the present time. 
 Other articles in Yedin-stvo bring this home to us still more forcibly. 
 But the workers want clarity, and they will get it, for they want to build up the unity of their organisation, not on the basis of diplomacy and equivocation, but on the basis of a precise appraisal of the political significance of thedifferent “trends”. 
 People who have two or even more opin-ions on this question are poor counsellors. 
 Trudovaya Pravda No. 
 30, Published according to July 2, 1914 the text in Trudovaya Pravda THE RESULTS OF WORKERS ’ PRESS DAY SUMMED UP THE REPORT PUBLISHED IN PUT PRAVDY It is only now that we are able to sum up some of the re-sults of Workers’ Press Day of April 22. 
221 The second anniversary of the newspaper Pravda became a day of review of the Marxist forces. 
 On that day all class-conscious workers came to the as-sistance of their working-class newspapers, and hundreds andthousands of rubles were collected kopek by kopek. 
 The latest report on sums collected on Workers’ Press Day was published only on June 14, in issue No. 
 15 of Trudo-vaya Pravda . 
 Press Day lasted nearly two months. 
 “Better late than never,” many comrades wrote, contrib-uting their mite after April 22. 
 Resolutions received by the editors have been so numerous that it has been impossible to list them all, let alone publish them. 
 But they have had the desired effect. 
 They have convinced us that we are on the right road, and that the vast majorityof the workers have accepted the slogans of consistent Marx-ism. 
 As is well known, the liquidators proclaimed the second anniversary of the newspapers of the Pravda trend as Press Day for their own newspaper, too. 
 They raised a hullaballooat the time to prove that they had a right to participate inPress Day precisely on April 22. 
 Already at that time theyproposed federation, an equal sharing of all the money col-lected. 
 April 22 showed that the liquidationist newspaper had spoken too soon about “federation” and “equality ”. 
 The workers of St. 
 Petersburg flatly rejected the proposal for “general collections”. 
 This call on the part of the liqui-PUT PRAVDY dationist newspaper evoked a certain response only among a section of the students, and in a few factories in the provinces. 
 The sums obtained by general collections hardly affected the total amount of Press Day collections. 
 Nasha Rabochaya Gazeta , issue No. 
 34, for June 13, already attempted to compare the collections made for that newspaper with thosemade for Put Pravdy . 
 We say an attempt, because the comparison made by Nasha Rabochaya Gazeta cannot pos-sibly be regarded as final and complete. 
 If we wanted toobtain such a complete comparison from Nasha Rabochaya Gazeta we should have to wait till doomsday, for it is greatly to the liquidators’ advantage to quote general figures with-out going into a detailed analysis of the amounts, and with-out ascertaining the sources they came from. 
 Consequently, we must ourselves undertake the task of analysing the liquidators’ reports. 
 Nasha Rabochaya Gazeta has arrived at highly gratifying conclusions, namely, (1) that the Pravdists have the backingof somewhat under three-fifths of the class-conscious workers of Russia, and (2) that the Pravdists predominate strongly only in St. 
 Petersburg, whereas in the provinces the reverseis the case; there the supporters of Nasha Rabochaya Gazeta predominate. 
 First of all, we must make a slight addition to the figures of our total collections which Nasha Rabochaya Gazeta has quoted from Trudovaya Pravda of June 11. 
 In that issue, the total figures were given up to June 1, but as Nasha Rabo-chaya Gazeta gives the total of its collections up to June 10, we must, to make a fair comparison, add the amountscollected from June 1 to June 10, reported in issue No. 
 15,of June 14. 
 Moreover, the figures up to June 10 were not quite accurate, as certain small contributions received from the provinces were included in the figures for St. 
 Petersburg. 
 After making these corrections we obtain the following final amounts, which we shall quote in the course of this article.

80 At first sight the difference is not very great and would seem to show that Nasha Rabochaya Gazeta has the backing of two-fifths of the class-conscious workers. 
 But as soon asthese figures are distributed by source, namely, contributionsfrom workers and non-workers, the picture changes com-pletely. 
 The country-wide response to the appeal by Put Pravdy on Workers Press Day was: 1, 915 workers ’ groups , which collected R. 
 16,163. 
71. 
 The response to the appeal by Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta was: 588 workers ’ groups , which collected R. 
 5,651. 
78. 
 From non-workers, Put Pravdy received R. 
1,842. 
53, whereas Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta received from this source R. 
6,062. 
02, i. 
e. 
, more than it received from workers. 
 These figures on the collections made for Workers’ Press Day reveal much the same thing as the figures of thecollections and groups during the period commencing Jan-uary 1,1914. 
 Of the total number of workers’ groups which responded on Workers’ Press Day, only a little over one-fifth responded to the liquidationist newspaper’s appeal,this despite the liquidators’ efforts to change the balance offorces in their favour on the eve of Workers’ Press Day. 
 Inthis they failed. 
 Four-fifths of the class-conscious workers support Pravdism. 
 This fact, deduced from the figures covering the entire period of two years that the legal news-papers have been in existence, was also confirmed on Work-ers’ Press Day. 
 Let us now examine the situation in St. 
 Petersburg and in the provinces. 
 In St. 
 Petersburg the number of collections (groups) made for the Pravdist newspaper amounted to 1,276, and the sum collected totalled R. 
10,762. 
46. 
 The corresponding figures for the liquidators’ newspaper were 224 and R. 
2,306. 
27. 
 The difference is so striking that even the liquidators do not dare deny that the Pravdists predom-inate among the most advanced, energetic, organised and politically experienced proletariat of the capital city. 
 But they claim the provinces. 
 “In the provinces,” wrote Nasha Rabochaya Gazeta , “we see the reverse of things in St. 
 Petersburg. 
 In the provinces Severnaya Rabo-chaya Gazeta alone collected more than the Pravdist organ. 
 ” This is a sample of deception , which we strongly advise our comrades, the workers, to examine very closely. 
 Whatis true is true: in the provinces the Pravdists collectedR. 
6,325. 
28 and the liquidators R. 
6,409. 
12. 
 More, is it not?But please look at the following figures. 
 In the provinces, the Pravdist newspaper received R. 
 5,401. 
25 from 639 workers’ groups and R. 
924. 
03 from non-workers. 
 But the liquidationist newspaper received R. 
3,345. 
51 from 364 workers’ groups and R. 
3,004. 
89 from 78 groups of non-workers and from individuals. 
 Yes, in the provinces the liquidators undoubtedly pre-dominate , only not among the workers, but among wealthy “friends and sympathisers”. 
 The liquidators did a very simple thing. 
 To prove that they “ predominate ” in the provinces they lumped the workers’ kopeks with the large sums contributed by their friendsamong the bourgeoisie, and thereby “squashed” the Pravdists! A clever move, perhaps, but in doing so, good gentlemen, you have not proved your preponderance in the provinces,but merely that you are no less divorced from the workers inthe provinces than you are from the St. 
 Petersburg workers. 
 What counts in establishing a working-class press and a working-class body is not big contributions from wealthy “friends”, but the activities of the workers themselves. 
 The fact that in building up a working-class newspaperand a working-class body the liquidators received nearlyas much from non-workers as they did from workers(R. 
5,115 and R. 
5,651) is, in our opinion, not an advantage, buta shortcoming; it is only further proof of the close connection between liquidationism and bourgeois intellectualist circles. 
 We, on our part, are proud that our “cast-iron reserve” consists almost entirely of kopeks from workers who, inthe course of six weeks, collected over R. 
16,000 for theirnewspaper. 
 How was this sum made up? Workers of which trades and areas helped in one degree or another to establish a consistent-ly Marxist newspaper? The answer to this is given in the following table, a docu-ment highly characteristic of the present state of the work-ing-class movement. 
 This table shows the sums received byPut Pravdy from various industries (trades). 
 The list is headed by the metalworkers, of course.

25 ST. 
 PETERSBURG During the past few years St. 
 Petersburg has been at the head of the working-class movement. 
 While the prole-tariat in some (now few) parts of the provinces cannotyet rouse themselves from the lethargy of 1907-11, and inother parts are only just taking the first steps to fall intoline with the St. 
 Petersburg proletariat, the latter has developed tremendous activity and, like a delicate barome-ter, has reacted to all events of concern to the working-class movement. 
 The St. 
 Petersburg proletariat is in theforefront. 
 Even Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta will scarcely attempt to deny this. 
 And this is how the St. 
 Petersburg proletariat responded to Workers’ Press Day. 
 Collections for Put Pravdy were made here by 1,276 groups, which gave R. 
10,762. 
46; for Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta collections were made by 224 groups, which gave R. 
2,306. 
27. 
 Counting by the number of groups, the liquidators in the working-class movement in St. 
 Petersburg are supported not by one-fifth but by one-seventh of the class-consciousworkers; their collections amount only to a little over one-sixth of those made by the Pravdists. 
 These figures show that the bulk of the St. 
 Petersburg proletariat, which stands at the head of the working-class movement, has turned away from the liquidators and sup-ports the old and uncurtailed slogans. 
 Even among the printers, that sole refuge of the liquidators among the organised workers, nearly fivetimes as much was collected for the Pravdist press as wascollected for the liquidationist press (R. 
966. 
34 for Put Pravdy , as against R. 
201. 
21 for Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta ). 
 The same thing is shown by the collections among the metalworkers. 
 Here, Put Pravdy collected R. 
5,075. 
49 as against R. 
1,283. 
66 collected for Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta , i. 
e. 
, four times as much; during the union’s existence thiswas confirmed by the constant defeats of the liquidators at elections, general meetings, etc. 
 Among other trades in St. 
 Petersburg, the position of the liquidators is still worse. 
 Woodworkers, for example, con- /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR tributed R. 
1,014. 
73 to Put Pravdy , but only R. 
38. 
14* t o Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta . 
 The liquidationist press has often proclaimed from the house-tops that only the most ignorant masses, who do notunderstand serious questions, follow the lead of Pravda . 
 In the recently published June issue of Nasha Zarya , the overzealous liquidator, Mr. 
 A. 
 Gorev, asserts that the collec-tions and resolutions in support of Pravda “come from those sections of the workers who, for the first time in the history of the Russian working-class movement, are being drawninto the sphere of interests and controversies of Social-Democracy”—from the midst of the ignorant, non-class-conscious youth and backward workers. 
 Do the liquidators dare include in those “sections” the metalworkers and printers, who have always been in the forefront of the working-class movement? Mr. 
 Gorev, ofcourse, has no evidence whatever in support of his argu-ment, which is based entirely on subjective assumptions. 
Well, let him keep to them. 
 We have however proved withthe aid of irrefutable figures that even among advanced trades like the printers and metalworkers of St. 
 Petersburg, the liquidators have the support of barely one-fifth of theworkers. 
 Lack of space prevents us from quoting the comparative figures of the collections in all the other trades. 
 We shalltherefore quote only the total figures for these trades. 
 In addition to the trades already enumerated, Put Pravdy received R. 
3,700 from workers, and Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta R. 
500. 
00 (in round figures). 
 These sums were contrib-uted by shop assistants, tailors, tanners, textile workers,bakers, and other workers engaged in small industry. 
 Here, too, Put Pravdy received seven times as much as Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta did. 
 Not a single trade contrib-uted more to Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta than it did to Put Pravdy . 
 Even office and other salaried employees col-lected R. 
273. 
11 for Put Pravdy , whereas for Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta the office employees and shop assistants *We ask Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta in advance to excuse us if, in examining its reports, we omitted one or two workshops whose trades were not specified. 
 This would not have happened had Sever-naya Rabochaya Gazeta tabulated its figures in greater detail. 
 combined (figures quoted by Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta ) collected R.

 The shop assistants collected R.

222 Trudovaya Pravda No. 
 30 and 31, Published according to July 2 and 3, 1914 the text in Trudovaya Pravda THE POLISH SOCIAL -DEMOCRATIC OPPOSITION AT THE PARTING OF THE WAYS The fact that the Polish Social-Democratic opposition at the Brussels Conference sided with the liquidators cameas a surprise to many Party people and as a shock to all of them. 
 The Polish Social-Democratic opposition was be-lieved to be as close to the Pravdists as the Letts were. 
 Andsuddenly we and the Letts at their post against the liqui-dators, while the Polish Social-Democrats played us false! What is the reason?The reason is that there are two trends among the Polish Social-Democrats: some of them want to remove Tyszka and Rosa Luxemburg in order to continue Tyszka’s policythemselves. 
 This is a policy of unprincipled diplomacyand “playing” between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks, betweenthe Party and its liquidators. 
 Voting for one side today,for another tomorrow. 
 Under the guise of “impartiality”, betrayal of all in turn, driving a bargain and securing “ad-vantages and privileges” for oneself. 
 The clauses of a fed-erative character in the Stockholm (1906) agreement betweenthe Polish and Russian Social-Democrats 223 were a useful weapon for this nasty policy, which Tyszka and Rosa Luxem-burg were conducting with such consummate skill. 
 The other trend stands for a complete breakaway from the liquidators, from federalism, from “playing” the role of“pendulum” between the two conflicting sides: it standsfor a sincere and close alliance with the Pravdists, with theParty. 
 In Brussels the former trend among the Polish Social-Democrats won the day. 
 As a result, there can obviously be nothing but absolute mistrust on our part towards the PolishSocial-Democrats. 
 The future will show whether the other trend will succeed in rallying itself and in raising a clear, precise and definite banner of a consistent, high-principled policy, a policy aimed, not only against the group of Tyszka but against the essence of Tyszka’s methods. 
 Needless tosay, the unity of the Polish Social-Democratic proletariatis possible only on the basis of such a policy. 
 The forthcoming steps towards such unity will definitely reveal the true state of affairs among the Polish Social-Democrats and will thereby determine our own attitude to-wards them.

 We gave the exact dates for which these figures were calculated (from January I to May 13, 1914). 
 The liquida-tors gave no dates. 
 Would it be honest, in such a case, to compare facts that are incomparable and unauthentic? 2. 
 The liquidators themselves stated and published in the press ( Nasha Rabochaya Gazeta No. 
 34) that all their groups, i. 
e. 
, not the workers’ groups alone, totalled 948. 
Our statistics, on the other hand, specified that the figures 2,873 and 671 referred to workers’ groups alone . 
 The total number of groups is given in our table, and that number does not coincide with the number of workers’ groups. 
 Is it honest to pass this over in silence? 3. 
 Our newspaper reported that we gave the contributions made by the workers’ groups for both newspapers and that we had no information about recurrent contributions by the same groups. 
 The information was the same for both news-papers. 
 It is absolutely incomprehensible how any honestcritic could discover an “error” here! 4. 
 We quoted parallel figures, that is, figures covering the same period for both newspapers, and the information for both papers was tabulated by the same method . 
 The liquidators quoted no parallel figures at all, thus violating the most elementary and well-known rules ofstatistical work. 
 Anyone who is interested in this questioncan easily get both newspapers and verify our information. 
 We are sure that no open-minded person can call the meth-ods used by the “critic ” Z.

 The article was preceded by lectures on the national question which Lenin delivered in a number of Swiss cities—Zurich, Ge-neva, Lausanne and Berne—in the summer of 1913.

 Pravda —a legal Bolshevik daily published in St. 
 Petersburg. 
 Founded on the initiative of the St. 
 Petersburg workers in April 1912. 
 Pravda was a popular working-class newspaper, published with money collected by the workers themselves. 
 A wide circle of worker-correspondents and worker-publicists formed around the news-paper. 
 Over eleven thousand correspondence items from workers were published in a single year. 
 Pravda had an average circulation of 40,000, with some issues running into 60,000 copies. 
 Lenin directed Pravda from abroad, where he was living. 
 He wrote for the paper almost daily, gave instructions to the edi-torial board and rallied the Party’s best literary forces around the newspaper. 
 Pravda was subjected to constant police persecution. 
 During the first year of its existence it was confiscated forty-one times, and thirty-six legal actions were brought against its editors, who served prison sentences totalling forty-seven and a half months. 
 In the course of two years and three months Pravda was closed down eight times by the tsarist government, but reissued under new names: Rabochaya Pravda , Severnaya Pravda , Pravda Truda , Za Pravdu , Proletarskaya Pravda , Put Pravdy , Rabochy , and Trudovaya Pravda . 
 On July 8 (21), 1914, on the eve of the First World War, the paper was closed down. 
 Publication was not resumed until after the February Revolu-tion. 
 Beginning from March 5 (18), 1917, Pravda appeared as the Central Organ of the R.

 Lenin joined the editorial board on April 5 (18), on his return from abroad, and took over the paper’s management. 
 In July-October 1917 Pravda changed its name frequently owing to persecution by the Provisional Govern-ment, appearing successively as Listok Pravdy , Proletary , Rabochy, and Rabochy Put . 
 On October 27 (November 9) the newspaper began to appear under its old name— Pravda .

 the Bund constantly supported the Party’s opportunist wing (the Economists, Mensheviks, and liq-uidators), and waged a struggle against the Bolsheviks and Bolshevism. 
 To the Bolsheviks’ programmatic demand for the right of nations to self-determination the Bund contraposed the demand for autonomy of national culture. 
 During the years of the Stolypin reaction and the new revolutionary upsurge, the Bund adopted a liquidationist stand and played an active part in the formation of the August anti-Party bloc. 
 During the First World War (1914-18) the Bundists took a social-chauvinist stand. 
 In 1917 the Bund supported the bourgeois Provisional Government and sided with the enemies of the Great October Socialist Revo-lution. 
 During the foreign military intervention and the Civil War, the Bundist leaders made common cause with the forces of counter-revolution. 
 At the same time a tendency towards co-operation with the Soviets became apparent among the Bund rank and file.

 The national question was the chief item on the agenda. 
 Two resolutions expressing different points of view were submitted to the Congress: (1) the resolution of the Party’s Central Committee supporting the idea of the territorial autonomy of nations, and (2) the resolution of the Committee of the South-Slav Social-Demo-cratic Party supporting the idea of extra-territorial cultural-national autonomy. 
 The Congress unanimously rejected the programme of cultural-na-tional autonomy, and adopted a compromise resolution recognising national autonomy within the boundaries of the Austrian state.

 Beilis, a Jew, was falsely accused of having murdered a Christian boy named Yushchinsky for ritual purposes (actually, the murder was organised by the Black Hun-dreds). 
 The aim of this frame-up was to fan anti-Semitism and incite pogroms so as to divert the masses from the mounting rev-olutionary movement. 
 The trial excited great public feeling. 
 Workers’ protest demonstrations were held in a number of cities Beilis was acquitted.

 37 Socialist-Revolutionaries —a petty-bourgeois party in Russia, which came into being at the end of 1901 and beginning of 1902 as a result of a merger of various Narodnik groups and circles. 
 The S. 
R. 
s saw no class distinctions between the proletarian and the petty proprietor, played down the class differentiation and antagonisms within the peasantry, and refused to recognise the proletariat’s leading role in the revolution. 
 Their views were an eclectic mixture of the ideas of Narodism and revisionism. 
 In Lenin’s words, they tried, to mend “the rents in the Narodnik ideas with bits of fashionable opportunist ‘criticism’ of Marxism. 
” (See present edition, Vol. 
 9, p. 
 310. 
) The Socialist-Revolutionaries’ agrarian programme envisaged the abolition of private ownership of the land, which was to be transferred to the village commune on the basis of the “labour principle” and “equalised land tenure”, and also the development of co-operatives. 
 This programme, which the S. 
R. 
s called “sociali-sation of the land”, had nothing socialist about it. 
 In his analysis of this programme, Lenin showed that the preservation of commod-ity production and private farming on communal land would not do away with the domination of capital or free the toiling peasantry from exploitation and impoverishment. 
 Neither could the co-operatives be a remedy for the small farmers under capi-talism, as they served only to enrich the rural bourgeoisie. 
 At the same time, as Lenin pointed out, the demand for equalised land tenure, though not socialistic, was of a progressive, revolu-tionary-democratic character, inasmuch as it was directed against reactionary landlordism. 
 The Bolshevik Party exposed the attempts of the S. 
R. 
s to pass themselves off as socialist. 
 It waged a stubborn fight against them for influence over the peasantry, and revealed the damage their tactic of individual terrorism was causing the working-class movement. 
 At the same time, the Bolsheviks, on definite terms, entered into temporary agreements with the Socialist-Revolu-tionaries to combat tsarism. 
 The Socialist-Revolutionary Party’s political and ideological instability and organisational incohesion, as well as its constant vacillation between the liberal bourgeoisie and the proletariat, were due to the absence of class homogeneity among the peasantry. 
 During the first Russian revolution, the Right wing of the S. 
R. 
s broke away from the party and formed the legal Labour Popular Socialist Party, whose views were close to those of the Constitu-15tional-Democrats (Cadets), while the Left wing split away and formed a semi-anarchist league of “Maximalists”. 
 During the period of the Stolypin reaction, the Socialist-Revolutionary Party suffered a complete break-down ideologically and organisationally. 
 During the First World War most of its members took a social-chauvinist stand. 
 After the February bourgeois-democratic revolution of 1917, the Socialist-Revolutionaries, together with the Mensheviks and the Cadets, were the mainstay of the counter-revolutionary Pro-visional Government of the bourgeoisie and landlords. 
 The leaders of the S. 
R. 
 Party—Kerensky, Avksentyev and Chernov—were members of this Cabinet. 
 The S. 
R. 
 Party refused to support the peasants’ demand for the abolition of landlordism, and stood for the preservation of landlord ownership. 
 The S. 
R. 
 members of the Provisional Government authorised punitive action against peasants who had seized landed estates. 
 At the end of November 1917 the Left wing of the S. 
R. 
 Party formed an independent party of Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, who, in an endeavour to preserve their influence among the peas-ant masses, formally recognised Soviet rule and entered into an agreement with the Bolsheviks. 
 Shortly, however, they began a struggle against the Soviets. 
 During the years of foreign intervention and the Civil War the S. 
R. 
s carried on counter-revolutionary subversive activities. 
 They actively supported the interventionists and whiteguards, took part in counter-revolutionary plots, and organised terroristic acts against leaders of the Soviet state and the Communist Party. 
 After the Civil War, the S. 
R. 
s continued their anti-Soviet activi-ties within the country and in the camp of the White émigrés.

 38 The Polish Socialist Party (Polska Partia Socjalistyczna)— a reformist nationalist organisation founded in 1892. 
 Adopt-ing the slogan of struggle for an independent Poland, the P. 
S. 
P. 
, under Pilsudski and his adherents, carried on separatist nation-alist propaganda among the Polish workers, whom they tried to divert from the joint struggle with the Russian workers against the autocracy and capitalism. 
 Throughout the history of the P. 
S. 
P. 
 Left-wing groups kept springing up within the party, as a result of the activities of the rank-and-file workers. 
 Some of these groups eventually joined the revolutionary wing of the Polish working-class movement. 
 In 1906 the party split up into the P. 
S. 
P. 
 Left-wing and the Right, chauvinist wing (the so-called “revolutionary faction”). 
 Under the influence of the Bolsheviks and the Social-Democratic Party of Poland and Lithuania, the Left wing gradually adopted a consistent revolutionary stand. 
 During the First World War some of the P. 
S. 
P. 
 Left-wing adopted an internationalist stand. 
 In December 1918 it united with the Social-Democrats of Poland and Lithuania to form the Communist Workers’ Party of Poland (as the Communist Party of Poland was known up to 1925). 
 16During the First World War, the P. 
S. 
P. 
 Right wing continued its policy of national chauvinism, organising Polish legions on the territory of Galicia to fight on the side of Austro-German im-perialism. 
 With the formation of the Polish bourgeois state, the Right P. 
S. 
P. 
 in 1919 united with the P. 
S. 
P. 
 organisations existing on Polish territories formerly seized by Germany and Austria, and resumed the name of the P. 
S. 
P. 
 At the head of the government, it arranged for the transfer of power to the Polish bourgeoisie, systematically carried on anti-communist propaganda, and supported a policy of aggression against the Soviet Union, a policy of conquest and oppression against Western Ukraine and Western Byelorussia. 
 Various groups in the P. 
S. 
P. 
 who disagreed with this policy joined the Communist Party of Poland. 
 After Pilsudski’s fascist coup d’état (May 1926), the P. 
S. 
P. 
 was nominally a parliamentary opposition but actually it did not carry on any active fight against the fascist regime, and con-tinued its anti-communist and anti-Soviet propaganda. 
 During that period the Left-wing elements of the P. 
S. 
P. 
 collaborated with the Polish Communists and supported united-front tactics in a number of campaigns. 
 During the Second World War the P. 
S. 
P. 
 again split up. 
 Its reactionary and chauvinist faction, which assumed the name “Wolno Y,, Równosc, Niepod /egloY,,” (Liberty, Equality, Inde-pendence), took part in the reactionary Polish émigré “government ” in London. 
 The Left faction, which called itself the Workers’ Party of Polish Socialists, under the influence of the Polish Workers’ Party, which was founded in 1942, joined the popu-lar front against the Nazi invaders, fought for Poland’s liber-ation, and pursued a policy of friendly relations with the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
 In 1944, after the liberation of Poland’s eastern territories and the formation of a Polish Committee of National Liberation, the Workers’ Party of Polish Socialists resumed the name of P. 
S. 
P. 
 and together with the P. 
W. 
P. 
 participated in the building up of a people’s democratic Poland. 
 In December 1948 the P. 
W. 
P. 
 and the P. 
S. 
P. 
 amalgamated and formed the Polish United Work-ers’ Party.

 38 Luch (Ray )—a legal daily of the Menshevik liquidators, published in St. 
 Petersburg from September 16 (29), 1912 to July 5 (18), 1913. 
 Put out 237 issues. 
 The newspaper was maintained chiefly by contributions from the liberals. 
 Ideological leadership was in the hands of P. 
 B. 
 Axelrod, F. 
 I. 
 Dan, L. 
 Martov, and A. 
 S. 
 Mar-tynov. 
 The liquidators used the columns of this newspaper to oppose the revolutionary tactics of the Bolsheviks, advocate the opportunist slogan of an “open party”, attack the revolutionary mass strikes of the workers, and attempt to revise the most impor-tant points of the Party Programme. 
 Lenin wrote that Luch was “enslaved by a liberal policy” and called the paper a mouthpiece of the renegades. 
 p. 
 38 17 18 19 20Prosveshcheniye (Enlightenment )—a Bolshevik, legal theoretical monthly published in St. 
 Petersburg from December 1911 to June 1914, with a circulation of up to five thousand copies. 
 The journal was founded on Lenin’s initiative to replace the Moscow-published Mysl , a Bolshevik journal which was closed down by the tsarist government. 
 Other workers on the new journal were V. 
 V. 
 Vorovsky, A. 
 I. 
 Ulyanova-Yelizarova, N. 
 K. 
 Krup-skaya and others. 
 Lenin enlisted the services of Maxim Gorky to run the journal’s literary section. 
 Lenin directed Prosveshcheniye from Paris and subsequently from Cracow and Poronin. 
 He edited articles and regularly corresponded with the editorial staff. 
 The journal published the following articles by Lenin: “The Three Sources and Three Component Parts of Marxism”, “Critical Remarks on the National Question”, “The Right of Nations to Self-Deter-mination”, “Disruption of Unity Under Cover of Outcries for Unity” and others. 
 The journal exposed the opportunists—the liquidators, otzo-vists, and Trotskyists, as well as the bourgeois nationalists. 
 It highlighted the struggle of the working class under conditions of a new revolutionary upsurge, propagandised Bolshevik slogans in the Fourth Duma election campaign, and came out against revisionism and centrism in the parties of the Second Internation-al. 
 The journal played an important role in the Marxist inter-nationalist education of the advanced workers of Russia. 
 On the eve of World War I, Prosveshcheniye was closed down by the tsarist government. 
 It resumed publication in the autumn of 1917, but only one issue (a double one) appeared, containing Lenin’s “Can the Bolsheviks Retain State Power?” and “A Review of the Party Programme”. 
 p. 
 38 Bernsteinism —an anti-Marxist trend in international Social-Democracy. 
 It arose towards the close of the nineteenth century in Germany and bore the name of the German opportunist Social-Democrat Eduard Bernstein. 
 After the death of F. 
 Engels, Bern-stein publicly advocated revision of Marx’s revolutionary theory in the spirit of bourgeois liberalism (see his article “Problems of Socialism” and his book The Premises of Socialism and the Tasks of Social-Democracy ) in an attempt to convert the Social-Demo-cratic Party into a petty-bourgeois party of social reforms. 
 In Russia this trend was represented by the “legal Marxists”, the Economists, the Bundists, and the Mensheviks. 
 p. 
 39 Lenin refers to Stalin’s article “Marxism and the National Question” published in the legal Bolshevik journal Prosveshcheniye , Nos. 
 3, 4 and 5 for 1913 under the title “The National Question and Social-Democracy”. 
 Chapter 4 of Stalin’s article quotes the text of the national programme adopted at the Brünn Congress of the Austrian Social-Democratic Party.

 39 Novaya Rabochaya Gazeta (New Workers ’ Paper )—a legal daily of the Menshevik liquidators, published in St. 
 Petersburg from 21 22 23 24 25 26August 1813. 
 From January 30 (February 12), 1914 it was super-ceded by Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta (Northern Workers ’ Paper ) and subsequently by Nasha Rabochaya Gazeta (Our Workers ’ Paper ). 
 Lenin repeatedly referred to this newspaper as the Novaya Likvidatorskaya Gazeta (New Liquidationist Paper ). 
 p. 
 40 Cadets —members of the Constitutional-Democratic Party, the principal party of the liberal-monarchist bourgeoisie in Russia. 
 It was formed in October 1905 and consisted of representatives of the bourgeoisie, landlord members of the Zemstvos, and bour-geois intellectuals. 
 Prominent leaders of the Cadets were: P. 
 N. 
 Mi-lyukov, S. 
 A. 
 Muromtsev, V. 
 A. 
 Maklakov, A. 
 I. 
 Shingaryov, P. 
 B. 
 Struve and F. 
 I. 
 Rodichev. 
 To mislead the masses the Cadets called themselves the “party of people’s freedom”, but actually they went no further than the demand for a constitutional monarchy. 
 They considered the fight against the revolutionary movement their chief aim, and strove to share power with the tsar and the feudalist landlords. 
 During World War I the Cadets actively supported the tsarist government’s aggressive foreign policy, and during the February 1917 bourgeois-democratic revolution they tried to save the monarchy. 
 Holding key posts in the bour-geois Provisional Government, the Cadets pursued an anti-popular and counter-revolutionary policy. 
 After the victory of the October Socialist Revolution, the Cadets came out as the avowed enemies of Soviet rule, taking part in all armed counter-revolutionary acts and campaigns of the interventionists. 
 Living abroad as émigrés after the defeat of the interventionists and whiteguards, the Ca-dets continued their anti -Soviet activities.

 The Conference was attended by representatives of the Bund, the Caucasian Regional Committee, the Social-Democrats of the Lettish Region and the liquidators’ groups resident abroad, namely, the 35 36 37editorial boards of Golos Sotsial-Demokrata , Trotsky’s Vienna Pravda and the Vperyod group. 
 Delegates from Russia were sent by the St. 
 Petersburg and Moscow “sponsor groups” of the liquidators and the editorial boards of the liquidationist publications Nasha Zarya and Nevsky Golos . 
 A representative of the Spilki Committee Abroad was also present. 
 The overwhelming majority of delegates were resident abroad and out of touch with the working class in Russia. 
 The Conference adopted anti-Party liquidationist decisions on all questions of Social-Democratic tactics, and declared against the existence of an illegal Party. 
 Unable to elect a Central Com-mittee, the liquidators confined themselves to setting up an Or-ganising Committee. 
 The August bloc, which consisted of ill-assorted elements, began to fall apart at the Conference itself, and soon broke down completely.

 In 1906 it became the organ of the Ministry of the Interior, being sub-sidised out of the government’s secret (“reptile”) funds. 
 Lenin called Rossiya “a venal police rag”. 
 Novoye Vremya (New Times )—daily published in St.

 Owned by various publishers, it fre-quently changed its political trend. 
 It was moderately liberal at the outset, but, after 1876, when it was published by A. 
 S. 
 Suvo-rin, it became the organ of reactionary circles of the nobility and the bureaucracy. 
 After 1905 it became a mouthpiece of the Black Hundreds. 
 Following the February bourgeois-democratic revolu-tion of 1917 the newspaper supported the counter-revolutionary policy of the bourgeois Provisional Government and hounded the Bolsheviks. 
 It was closed down by the Revolutionary Military Com-mittee of the Petrograd Soviet on October 26 (November 8), 1917.

 59 Insurance campaign refers to the struggle which developed in connection with the elections to the insurance agencies. 
 The cam-paign started in the autumn of 1912 following the introduction by the tsarist government on June 23, 1912, of a workers’ insur-ance law affecting only twenty per cent of the workers. 
 The Bolshe-viks used these elections for revolutionary propaganda and launched a campaign for the winning over of legal workers’ organ-isations and legal workers’ associations. 
 By combining legal and illegal activities, the Bolsheviks succeeded in winning in-fluence in the insurance bodies. 
 Elections to the Insurance Board were held in March 1914, and a workers’ group on insurance affairs was formed under the Board, which recognised as its official organ the Bolshevik journal Voprosy Strakhovania (Insurance Questions ).

 59 On June 3 (16), 1907 the tsar issued a manifesto dissolving the Second Duma and modifying the electoral law. 
 The new law con-siderably increased the representation of the landlords and the commercial and industrial bourgeoisie in the Duma, and made great cuts in the number of peasants’ and workers’ representatives, which was small enough as it is. 
 This was a gross violation of the Manifesto of October 17, 1905 and the Fundamental Law of 1906 by which no laws could be passed by the government without approval by the Duma. 
 The Third Duma, which was elected on the basis of this law and met on November 1 (14), 1907, was a Black-Hundred-Octobrist Duma. 
 The coup d’état of June 3 ushered in the period of the Stolypin reaction.

 D. 
 (1879-1940)—a bitter enemy of Leninism. 
 During the years of reaction and the new revolutionary upswing, he took what was virtually a liquidator stand under the guise of “non-factionalism”. 
 In 1912 he organised the anti-Party August bloc. 
 During the First World War he took a centrist stand. 
 Joined the Bolshevik Party on the eve of the October Socialist Revolution, but continued his factional activity. 
 In 1918 he opposed the sign-ing of the Peace of Brest. 
 In 1920-21 he opposed Lenin’s policy on the trade unions and the trade union movement. 
 In 1923 he led the opposition against the general line of the Party. 
 The Com-munist Party denounced Trotskyism as a petty-bourgeois devia-tion within the Party and defeated it ideologically and organisa-tionally. 
 In 1927 Trotsky was expelled from the Party.

 In 1912 he came out against the decisions of the Prague Conference. 
 Lenin sharply criticised Tyszka’s activities during that period. 
 During World War I Tyszka took an Internationalist stand. 
 In 1918 he helped to found the Com-munist Party of Germany and was elected Secretary of its Central Committee.

P. 
 was represented by Lenin, who made a report at the Conference on “The Present Moment and the Tasks of the Par-ty”, as well as speeches on the Social-Democratic group in the Duma, on the organisational and other questions. 
 At this Con-ference the Bolsheviks waged a struggle against the two types of opportunism within the Party—the liquidators and the otzo-vists. 
 On a motion by Lenin the Conference denounced liquida-tionism and called upon all Party organisations to fight reso-lutely against any attempts to liquidate the Party. 
 For an appraisal of the Conference’s decisions see Lenin’s ar-ticles “On the Road” and “The Liquidation of Liquidationism”.

 The conciliators pre-ponderated at the meeting and were able to get a number of anti-Leninist decisions adopted. 
 Only after Lenin’s insistent demands did the Plenum adopt a resolution condemning liquidationism and otzovism.

 Bogdanov and G. 
 Alexinsky. 
 It had several small circles, consisting mostly of intellectuals, in Paris, Geneva and Tiflis. 
 In Lenin’s words, the views of the Vperyod group were “a caricature of Bolshevism”. 
 With no support among the workers, the group fell apart in 1913.

 p. 
 98 The reference is to Byelorussian Socialist Hromada —a nationalist organisation which came into being in 1902 under the name of “Byelorussian Revolutionary Hromada”. 
 It defended the interests of the Byelorussian bourgeoisie, landlords and kulaks, denied the revolutionary class struggle, and tried to keep the Byelorussian people away from the Russian revolutionary working class. 
 These attempts met with no support among the working masses of the Byelorussian people. 
 In the national question, the Hromada stood for “cultural-national autonomy”. 
 After the February bourgeois-democratic revolution of 1917 the Hromada supported the policy of the bourgeois Provisional Government. 
 Following the October Socialist Revolution it split up into three counter-revolutionary groups who joined the whiteguards and foreign interventionists in an active struggle against the Soviets. 
 Dashnaktsutyun —a bourgeois-nationalist party founded in the early nineties of the nineteenth century in Turkish Armenia with the aim of liberating the Armenians from the Turkish yoke. 
 The party was a bourgeois-democratic conglomerate of represen-tatives of various classes. 
 Alongside the bourgeoisie, a prominent place in it was occupied by the national intelligentsia, as well as by peasants and workers unaffected by Social-Democratic propa-ganda, and part of the lumpenproletariat forming the zinvors squads. 
 On the eve of the 1905-07 Revolution this party transferred its activities to the Caucasus and aligned itself with the Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
 The party’s Left wing formed the Young Dash-naktsutyun group, which joined the S. 
 R. 
 Party in 1907. 
 The activities of the Dashnaktsutyun were of an anti-popular nature. 
 Its nationalist propaganda was greatly detrimental to the internationalist education of the proletariat and the masses of Armenia and the entire Transcaucasia. 
 After the February bourgeois-democratic revolution of 1917, the Dashnaks supported the policy of the bourgeois Provisional Government. 
 After the October Socialist Revolution they entered into a counter-revolutionary bloc with the Mensheviks, S. 
R. 
s and Musavatists against the Bolsheviks. 
 In 1918-20 the Dashnaks stood at the head of the bourgeois-nationalist counter-revolu-tionary government of Armenia. 
 Their action was designed to convert Armenia into a colony of the foreign imperialists and a stronghold of the Anglo-French interventionists and Russian white-guards in their struggle against the Soviet government. 
 Under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party and with the help of the Red Army, the working people of Armenia overthrew the Dashnak government in November 1920. 
 With the victory of the Soviets, the Dashnaktsutyun organisations in Transcaucasia were smashed and liquidated. 
 Georgian Socialists-Federalists —a bourgeois-nationalist party founded in April 1906, demanded national autonomy for Georgia within the framework of the Russian bourgeois-landlord state. 
 During the period of reaction, the Socialists-Federalists became open opponents of the revolution. 
 In concert with the Mensheviks and anarchists, this party tried to smash the united international front of the working people of Transcaucasia against tsarism and 62 64 65 66 67capitalism. 
 After the Great October Socialist Revolution the S. 
F. 
s, together with the Georgian Mensheviks, the Dashnaks and Musavatists, organised a counter-revolutionary bloc, which was supported by the Germano-Turkish, and later, by the Anglo-French interventionists p. 
 101 Stolypin ’s agrarian policy aimed at using the kulaks as a bulwark of the regime in the countryside. 
 The tsarist governmentissued a Ukase on November 9 (22), 1906 regulating the peasants’ withdrawal from the communes and the establishment of their proprietary rights on the allotment lands. 
 After its approval, with slight modifications by the Duma and the Council of State, this Ukase became known as the Law of June 14, 1910. 
 Under this Stolypin law (which got its name from P. 
 A. 
 Stolypin, Chair-man of the Council of Ministers) the peasant was free to withdraw from the village commune, take possession of his allotment on a proprietorship basis, and sell it. 
 The rural community was obliged to give the peasants who withdrew from the commune an allot-ment of land in one place (an otrub , homestead). 
 The Stolypin reform speeded up the development of capitalism in the country-side and the process of differentiation among the peasantry, and sharpened the class struggle in the village. 
 The Stolypin reform is characterised and evaluated in a number of works by Lenin, notably in his The Agrarian Programme of Social-Democracy in the First Russian Revolution , 1905 -1907 .

 B. 
 Struve and S.

 Frank. 
 Issued in Moscow in the spring of 1909. 
 In articles on the Russian intelligentsia the Vekhists tried to malign the revolutionary-democratic traditions of the Russian nation’s finest sons, among them V. 
 G. 
 Belinsky and N. 
 G. 
 Cher-nyshevsky. 
 They vilified the revolutionary movement of 1905 and thanked the tsarist government for having saved the bour-geoisie from “the fury of the people” “with its bayonets and jails”. 
 The symposium called upon the intelligentsia to serve the autoc-racy. 
 Lenin compared the Vekhi programme in philosophy and journalism with that of the Black-Hundred newspaper Moskovskiye Vedomosti , and called the symposium “an encyclopaedia of liberal renegacy”, “nothing but a flood of reactionary mud poured on democracy”.

 118Trudoviks (the Trudovik group)—a group of petty-bourgeois democrats in the Russian Duma consisting of peasants and intellec-tuals of a Narodnik trend. 
 The Trudovik group was formed in April 1906 of peasant deputies to the First Duma. 
 The Trudoviks demanded abolition of all social-estate and national restrictions, democratisation of rural and urban self-government, and universal franchise in Duma elections. 
 Their agrarian programme was based on the Narodnik principles of 74 75“equalised” land tenure, all the state, crown, and church lands being united in a national land fund, inclusive of all privatelyowned lands whose size exceeded the established labour norm;the owners of lands thus alienated were to receive compensation. 
 Lenin pointed out in 1906 that the typical Trudovik was a peas-ant who “is not averse to a compromise with the monarchy, tosettling down quietly on his own plot of land under the bourgeois system; but at the present time his main efforts are concentratedon the fight against the landlords for land, on the fight againstthe feudal state and for democracy. 
” (See present edition, Vol. 
 11, p. 
 229. 
) In the Duma the Trudoviks vacillated between the Cadets and the Social-Democrats. 
 This vacillation was conditioned bythe very class nature of the petty proprietors—the peasants. 
 Sincethe Trudoviks to a certain extent represented the peasant masses,the Bolsheviks in the Duma pursued the tactic of agreement with them on various issues for joint struggle against tsarism and the Cadets. 
 In 1917 the Trudovik group merged with the “PopularSocialist” Party and actively supported the bourgeois ProvisionalGovernment. 
 After the October Socialist Revolution the Trudo-viks sided with the bourgeois counter-revolution. 
 p. 
 119 Popular Socialists —a petty-bourgeois party formed in 1906 from the breakaway Right wing of the Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
 Theirpolitical views were close to those of the Cadets. 
 After the Feb-ruary Revolution of 1917 the P. 
S. 
s supported the bourgeois Pro-visional Government, and after the October Socialist Revolutionthey joined forces with the counter-revolution to fight the So-viets. 
 p. 
 119 Lenin is referring to the conference of the extended Editorial Board of “Proletary ” held in Paris on June 8-17 (21-30), 1909, and attended by nine members of the Bolshevik Centre (elected by the Bolshevikgroup of the Fifth [London] Congress of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 in 1907), headed by Lenin, and by representatives of the St. 
 Petersburg, Moscow regional and Urals organisations. 
 The meeting was called to discuss the conduct of the otzovists and ultimatumists. 
 It dealt with the following questions: (1) ot-zovism and ultimatumism; (2) god-building tendencies amongthe Social-Democrats; (3) the attitude to Duma activities among other fields of Party work; (4) the tasks of the Bolsheviks in the Party; (5) the Party school being set up abroad (on Capri); (6)agitation for a Bolshevik congress or Bolshevik conference sep-arate from the Party; (7) the breakaway of Comrade Maximov,and other questions. 
 In the chair was Lenin, who spoke on the main items of the agenda. 
 Otzovism and ultimatumism at the meeting were repre-sented and defended by A. 
 Bogdanov (Maximov) and V. 
 Shantser(Marat). 
 Kamenev, Zinoviev, Rykov and Tomsky took a concil-iatory stand. 
 76 77 78 79 80The meeting condemned otzovism and ultimatumism as being “liquidationism inside out”. 
 The Capri “Party” school organisedby the otzovists was declared to be “the centre of the breakawayfaction”. 
 A. 
 Bogdanov refused to accept the rulings of the extended editorial board of Proletary and was expelled from the Bolshevik organisation. 
 The meeting also condemned god-building and resolved to wage a determined struggle against it by exposing its anti-Marxistcharacter.

 Lenin’s manuscript plan for this publication list the articles he thought should be included in this symposium, and mentions the various issues of the newspapers from which thesearticles were to be taken (Lenin changed the headings of some ofthe articles for the symposium). 
 According to this plan, the sym-posium was to be in two parts, whose contents were announcedin the newspaper Put Pravdy No. 
 42 for March 21, 1914. 
 Part I of the symposium did not appear. 
 Several dozen copies of Part II, which the publishers were late in taking delivery offrom the printers, were confiscated. 
 The bulk of the edition, how-ever, was distributed. 
 81 8283 84 85 86Part II of the symposium contained, in addition to the Preface dated February 1914 and Concluding Remarks, fourteen articles by Lenin, namely: “The Legal Party and the Marxists”, “A Liberal Labour Party Manifesto”, “How P.

 The latter article has a supplement specially written for the symposium—an article entitled “How the Workers Responded to the Formation of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Group in the Duma”. 
 (See pp.

 Over twenty Party organisations were represented at the Con-ference, which was also attended by representatives of the Edi-torial Board of the Central Organ Sotsial-Demokrat , the Editorial Board of Rabochaya Gazeta , the Committee of the Organisation Abroad, and the Transport Group of the Central Committee of the R.

 Lenin represented the Editorial Board of the Central Organ. 
 The Conference was conducted by Lenin, who, at the opening, spoke on the constitution of the Conference, made reports on the current situation and the tasks of the Party, and the work of the International Socialist Bureau, and took part in the debates on the work of the Central Organ, the tasks of the Social-Democrats in combating famine, on the organisational question, the work of the Party organisation abroad, and other questions. 
 Lenin drafted resolutions on all the important questions standing on the agenda. 
 Lenin’s report on “The Tasks of the Party in the Present Situa-tion” and the corresponding resolution of the Conference gave a profound analysis of the political situation within the country, and showed that revolutionary sentiment among the masses was running high. 
 The Conference emphasised that the task of the conquest of power by the proletariat, who led the peasantry remained that of a democratic revolution in Russia. 
 The most important task of the Conference was to rid the Party of the opportunists. 
 Its resolutions on “Liquidationism and the Group of Liquidators” and on “The Party Organisation Abroad” were of tremendous significance in point of principle and prac-tice. 
 The liquidators were grouped around two legal journals— Nasha Zarya and Dyelo Zhizni . 
 The Conference declared that, “by their behaviour, the Nasha Zarya and Dyelo Zhizni group had placed themselves irretrievably beyond the pale of the Party”. 
 The liquidators were expelled from the R.

 The Confer-ence condemned the activities of the anti-Party groups abroad— the Menshevik Golos group, the Vperyod group and the Trotskyists. 
 The existence abroad of a united Party organisation working for the Party under the control and guidance of the Central Committee was recognised as an absolute necessity by the Conference, which pointed out that the groups abroad “which do not submit to the Social-Democratic centre in Russia, that is, the Central Committee, and which introduce disorganisation by establishing special con-tacts with Russia over the head of the C. 
C. 
 cannot speak on behalf of the R.

” These resolutions played a tremendous role in strengthening the unity of the Marxist party in Russia. 
 One of the highlights of the Conference was the question of participation in the Fourth Duma election campaign. 
 The Con-ference stressed that the chief task of the Party at the elections and of the Social-Democratic group in the Duma itself was so-cialist class propaganda and the organisation of the working class. 
 Basic minimum-programme demands for a democratic republic, an eight-hour day, and confiscation of all landed estates were advanced by the Conference as the Party’s principal election slogans. 
 The Conference adopted a resolution on “The Character and Organisational Forms of Party Work”, endorsed the changes in the Party Rules proposed by Lenin, confirmed Sotsial-Demokrat in its status of the Party’s Central Organ, elected a Central Com-mittee of the Party, and set up a Russian Bureau of the Central Committee. 
 The Prague Conference of the R. 
S.

L. 
P. 
 played an outstanding part in building up the Bolshevik Party, a party of a new type. 
 It summed up the entire historical phase of the Bolsheviks’ struggle against the Mensheviks, and consolidated the Bolsheviks’ victory. 
 The Menshevik liquidators were expelled from the Party. 
 The 91 9293 94 95 96local Party organisations rallied around the decisions of the Con-ference, which strengthened the Party as an all-Russia organi-sation. 
 The political line and tactics of the Party under the con-ditions of a new revolutionary upswing were laid down. 
 Purged of the opportunists, the Bolshevik Party took the lead in the new powerful upsurge of the revolutionary struggle of the masses. 
 Of great international significance, the Prague Conference gave the revolutionary elements in the parties of the Second Interna-tional an example of determined struggle against opportunism, which it conducted to the extent of a complete organisational break with the opportunists.

 Salazkin, President of the Nizhni-Novgorod Fair and Ex-change Committee, at a special meeting of the Committee held on August 16 (29), 1913 in connection with the visit to the Fair of Prime Minister Kokovtsov. 
 On behalf of all Russia’s merchants Salazkin urged upon Kokovtsov the “vital necessity” of radical political reforms on the basis of the tsar’s Manifesto of October 17, 1905, and expressed the desire of the commercial and industrial world “to take a direct part in the affairs of public self-government and state organisation”. 
 Lenin repeatedly referred to this speech in his articles.

 172 Lenin is referring to the Fourth Congress of the Social-Democrats of the Lettish Region held on January 13-26 (January 26-Februa-ry 8), 1914, in Brussels. 
 Lenin, who took an active part In organising and conducting the Congress, carried on a busy pre-congress correspondence withthe Bolsheviks of Latvia and went to Berlin and Paris to meetthem to settle questions pertaining to preparations for the Con-gress, its composition, the possible outcome of the struggle at the Congress, etc. 
 At the Congress Lenin made a report on the LettishSocial-Democrats’ attitude to the R.

 and the split in theDuma group, and took part in the meeting of the Bolshevik del-egates, whom he helped with the drafting of resolutions. 
 On theevening of January 12 (25), 1914, the day before the Congress, Lenin gave a lecture on the national question to the Congress delegates in Brussels, in which he expounded the theory and tac-tics of Bolshevism in the national question. 
 Lenin called uponthe Marxists of Latvia to strengthen real, not imaginary, unityof the Party, and defend its ranks against the vacillators andthe liquidators, who were openly betraying the cause the working class. 
 Lenin drew extensively upon the resolutions of the Fourth Congress of the Lettish Social-Democrats in his struggle against theliquidators and Trotskyists. 
 (See the articles in this volume: “TheLettish Workers and the Split in the Social-Democratic Group In theDuma”, “The ‘August’ Fiction Exposed”, “The Liquidators and the Lettish Working-Class Movement” and others. 
) As a result of the stiff struggle against conciliatory tendencies waged at the Congressby Lenin and the Lettish Bolsheviks they succeeded in securingthe withdrawal of the Lettish Social-Democrats from the Augustbloc. 
 Lenin called this withdrawal a “deadly blow” at the Trots-kyist alliance. 
 p. 
 178 Lenin is quoting from the resolution of the Fourth Congress of the Lettish Social-Democrats “with the unavoidable changes”,necessitated by the tsarist censorship. 
 Thus, instead of thewords “Congress of the Social-Democrats of the Lettish Region”,he uses the phrase “representatives of all the Lettish Marxist workers”; instead of “the R.

 Sovremenny Mir (Contemporary World )—a literary, scientific and political monthly pubIished in St. 
 Pbtersburg from October 1906 to 1918. 
 Its chief contributors were Mensheviks, includingPlekhanov. 
 Bolsheviks contributed to the journal during the blocwith the Plekhanovites and at the beginning of 1914. 
 During World War I (1914-18) it became the organ of the social-chauvin-ists.

 194 The article “ Forms of the Working-Class Movement (The Lockout and Marxist Tactics ) “ was written in connection with the lockout declared by St. 
 Petersburg factory owners on March 20 (April 2), 1914. 
 In March 1914 mass cases of poisoning occurred among the women employed at the Treugolnik Mills in St. 
 Petersburg, evok-ing general indignation and strikes of protest on the part of the workers in the capital. 
 The St. 
 Petersburg factory owners retortedby a lockout, as many as 70,000 workers being thrown out in asingle day. 
 The aim was to provoke the workers to a mass strike,the better to be able to make short work of the labour movement. 
But, led by the Bolsheviks, the workers refused to be provoked. 
 In view of the lockout, the declaration of a mass strike was considered inadvisable, and Pravda called the workers to other forms of struggle, such as mass meetings at the factories and rev-olutionary demonstrations in the streets. 
 The St. 
 PetersburgCommittee of the R.

 On the appointed day the newspaper Put Pravdy came out with an editorial by Lenin—“Forms of the Working-Class Move-ment”. 
 This article, in a form adapted to the conditions of the100 101 102 103 104“Capitalism existing censorship, urged the workers to carry out the decisions of the Cracow meeting of the C.

 held jointly with Party workers, which mentioned the need to discover “new forms of struggle against lockouts” and to replace political strikes “by revolutionary meetings and revolutionary street demon-strations”. 
 Lenin laid special emphasis on the importance of revolutionary demonstrations as a time-tested form of struggle. 
 The workers responded to the Party’s appeal with a powerful revolutionary demonstration, which was reported by all the bour-geois newspapers. 
 Reporting the demonstration, the liquidation-ist Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta made no mention of the leaflets distributed by the St. 
 Petersburg Committee, and even attacked Lenin’s article “Forms of the Working-Class Movement”. 
 At a time when the workers were engaged in a sharp struggle against the capitalists, the liquidators called upon the workers to “calm down” and attacked the Bolsheviks for organising the revolutionary demonstration. 
 Lenin called the liquidators’ behaviour monstrous, and described their attitude to the Fourth of April demonstration as a typical instance of wrecking illegal work.

 In the chair was Lenin, who made reports on the subjects “The Revolu-tionary Upswing, Strikes and the Tasks of the Party”, “The At-titude to the Liquidators and Unity” (the texts of these reports are missing), drafted and edited all the resolutions, and wrote the “Report” of the meeting by the C.

 The Conference adopted decisions on the most important issues of the working-class movement, namely: the tasks of the Party in connection with the new revolutionary upswing and the grow-ing strike movement, the building-up of the illegal organisation, the work of the Social-Democratic group in the Duma, the in-surance campaign, the Party press, the national Social-Democratic organisations, the struggle against liquidationism, and the unity of the proletarian party. 
 The Conference’s decisions played an important part in streng-thening the Party and its unity, in extending and consolidating the Party’s contacts with the masses, and evolving new forms of Party work adapted to the rising wave of the working-class movement.

 217 Progressists —a political group of the Russian liberal-monarchist boureeoisie, which, during the elections to the Duma and within the Duma, attempted to unite elements of the various bourgeois-landlord parties and groups under the nag of “non-partisanship”. 
 In November 1912 the Progressists formed an independent political party with the following programme: a moderate con-stitution with restricted electoral qualiflcations, petty reforms, a responsible Ministry, i. 
e. 
, a government accountable to the Duma, and suppression of the revolutionary movement. 
 Lenin pointed out that in composition and ideology the Progressists were “ a cross between Octobrists and Cadets ” and described the programme of the Progressist Party as being a national-liberal programme. 
 During World War I the Progressists became more active and demanded a change of military leadership, the gearing of industry to the needs of the front, and a “responsible Ministry” with the participation of representatives of the Russian bourgeoisie. 
 After the February bourgeois-democratic revolution some of the party’s leaders were members of the bourgeois Provisional Government. 
 After the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution the Progressist Party waged an active struggle against the Soviet government.

 Ogaryov from July 1, 1857 to April 1865 in London, and from May 1865 to July 1867 in Geneva. 
 Published as a monthly and for some time as a fortnightly, it put out 245 issues. 
 In 1868 the journal was published in French (15 issues in all) with an occasional sup-plement in Russian. 
 Kolokol , which was published in 2,500 copies and circulated throughout Russia, exposed the tyranny of the autoc-racy, the extortion and embezzlement practised by the govern-ment officials, and the ruthless exploitation of the peasants by the landlords. 
 Kolokol addressed revolutionary calls to the masses rousing them to the struggle against the tsarist government and the ruling classes. 
 The leading organ of the revolutionary uncensored press and the precursor of the working-class press in Russia, Kolokol played an important role in the development of the general democratic and revolutionary movement, in the struggle against the autocracy and serfdom.

 At the same time they denied the tendency towards the development of capitalist relations in Russia, and consequently, considered the peasantry, not the proletariat, the principal revolutionary force. 
 They regarded the village commune as the embryo of socialism. 
 In their endeavour to rouse the peasants to the struggle against the autocracy, the Narodniks went into the villages, “among the people”, but they met no support there. 
 In the eighties and nineties the Narodniks adopted a policy of conciliation with tsarism. 
 They expressed the interests of the kulaks and waged a fierce struggle against Marxism.

 held in Minsk on March 1-3 (13-15), 1898. 
 The Congress was attended by nine delegates from six organisations: the St. 
 Petersburg, Moscow, Ekaterinoslav and Kiev Leagues of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class, from the Kiev Rabochaya Gazeta group and from the Bund. 
 The Congress elected a Central Committee of the Party, confirmed Rabochaya Gazeta as the Party’s official organ, published a Manifesto, and proclaimed the Union of Rus-sian Social-Democrats Abroad the foreign representative of the Party. 
 The First Congress of the R.

 was significant in that it adopted decisions and a Manifesto proclaiming the establish-ment of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, thereby playing an important role in the matter of revolutionary propa-ganda. 
 The Congress, however, did not adopt a Programme or draft Party Rules. 
 The Central Committee elected at the Congress was soon arrested and the printing-press of Rabochaya Gazeta was seized, thus making it impossible for the Congress to unite and establish contact between the various Marxist circles and organisations. 
 There was no single central leadership and no single line in the work of the local organisations.

 248 Rabotnik (The Worker )—a non-periodical symposium published abroad in 1896-99 by the Union of Russian Social-Democrats under the editorship of the Emancipation of Labour group. 
 The symposium was issued on the initiative of Lenin who, during his journey abroad in 1895, made arrangements with Plekhanov and Axelrod for the symposium to be edited and published by the Eman-cipation of Labour group. 
 On his return to Russia Lenin did much to organise support for this publication and have articles and cor-121 122 123 respondence sent to it from Russia. 
 Before his arrest in December 1895 Lenin had prepared and forwarded to Rabotnik an obituary article “Frederick Engels’ and several items of correspondence, some of which (those from A. 
 A. 
 Vaneyev, M. 
 A. 
 Silvin, and S. 
 P.

 249 Vperyod (Forward )—an illegal Bolshevik weekly published in Geneva from December 22, 1904 (January 4, 1905) to May 5 (18), 1905. 
 Eighteen issues were put out. 
 Its organiser, manager and guiding spirit was Lenin. 
 Other members of the editorial board were V. 
 V. 
 Vorovsky, A. 
 V Lunacharsky, and M. 
 S. 
 Olminsky. 
 All correspondence, including that of the local committees in Russia, was handled by N. 
 K. 
 Krupskaya. 
 Lenin defined the con-tent of the newspaper in the following words: “The line of Vperyod is the line of the old ‘Iskra ’. 
 In the name of the old Iskra , Vperyod resolutely combats the new Iskra . 
” (See present edition, Vol. 
 8, p. 
 130. 
) Besides leading articles, Lenin wrote numerous paragraphs for Vperyod and rewrote items of correspondence. 
 Some articles were written by Lenin in co-operation with other members of the editorial board (Vorovsky, Olminsky and others). 
 Over sixty articles and minor items by Lenin were published in Vperyod . 
 Some issues of the newspaper, e. 
g. 
, Nos. 
 4 and 5, which dealt with the events of January 9 (22), 1905, and the beginning of the revolution in Russia, were written almost entirely by Lenin. 
 His articles in Vperyod were often reprinted in the local Bolshevik press and published in the form of leaflets and pamphlets. 
 The outstanding role which the newspaper played in combating Menshevism, reasserting the Party principle, formulating and elucidating the issues posed by the rising revolution, and fighting for a congress to be convened, was acknowledged in a special resolution of the Third Party Congress which recorded a vote of thanks to the editorial board. 
 By a decision of the Third Congress the newspaper Vperyod was superceded by Proletary . 
 Proletary (The Proletarian )—an illegal Bolshevik weekly, Central Organ of the R.

D. 
L. 
P. 
, founded in accordance with a resolution of the Third Party Congress. 
 By a decision of the plen-ary meeting of the Party Central Committee of April 27 (May 10), 1905, Lenin was appointed Editor-in-Chief. 
 Proletary was pub-lished in Geneva from May 14 (27) to November 12 (25), 1905. 
 Twenty-six issues were put out. 
 Proletary carried on the line of the old, Leninist, Iskra and preserved complete continuity with the Bolshevik newspaper Vperyod . 
 Lenin wrote about ninety articles and paragraphs for the news-paper. 
 His articles determined the paper’s political character, its ideological message and Bolshevik trend. 
 Lenin bore a heavy burden of the work on the newspaper as manager and editor, re-ceiving regular assistance from the other members of the editorial board—Vorovsky, Lunacharsky and Olminsky. 
124 Proletary reacted immediately to all important events in the Russian and international labour movement, and waged a relent-less struggle against the Mensheviks and other opportunist re-visionist elements. 
 The newspaper did a great deal to propagandise the decisions of the Third Party Congress, and played an impor-tant part in rallying the Bolsheviks organisationally and ideolog-ically. 
 Proletary consistently advocated revolutionary Marxism and formulated all the basic issues involved in the rising revolu-tion in Russia. 
 The newspaper highlighted the events of 1905 and roused the broad masses of the working people to the struggle for the victory of the revolution. 
 Proletary gave a good deal of attention to the local Social-Democratic organisations. 
 Some of Lenin’s articles in this newspaper were reprinted by the local Bolshevik newspapers and distributed in leaflet form. 
 Proletary suspended publication shortly after Lenin’s departure for Russia early in November 1905. 
 The last two issues (Nos. 
 25 and 26) were edited by Vorovsky, but even these contained several articles by Lenin, which were published after his departure from Geneva.

 Beginning with No. 
 9 for May 5 (18), 1906 (after the close of the Fourth Congress and Lenin’s arrival from Stockholm) the paper was virtually edited by Lenin. 
 Some twenty-five articles by him were published in the paper.

 p. 
 256 Lenin refers to the International Socialist Congress in Stuttgart (the Seventh Congress of the Second International) held in August 1907. 
 One of the principal items on the agenda was the colonial question, over which a sharp struggle was waged at the Congress. 
 The opportunist section of the Congress moved a resolution justi-fying colonial conquests. 
 The Dutch “socialist” Van Kol made a statement to the effect that in future socialists should go to “the savage peoples” not only with machines and other achievements of culture, but with weapons in their hands. 
 The opportunist draft resolution was supported by the majority of the German delegation. 
 Only as a result of the efforts of the Russian and Polish socialists, a small part of the German, French and British social-ists, as well as of all the socialists of the small countries owning no colonies, was this resolution defeated, and amendments adopted to it which practically changed its whole tenor. 
 The res-olution on the colonial question adopted by the Congress plainly and unreservedly condemned every kind of colonial policy.

 This school was a species of vulgar political economy, but unlike some of the latter’s exponents, it determined the value of a commodity, not simply by its utility, but by the utility of the final (marginal) unit of stock of the given128 129 130 131 132 commodity which satisfies the least urgent needs of a person. 
 In substance, the theory of “marginal utility”, like the sum total of the economic and philosophical tenets of the Austrian school was merely an attempt to gloss over the essential nature of ex-ploitation under capitalism. 
 p. 
 260 Otzovism (from the Russian word meaning “withdrawal”)—an op-portunist trend which arose among the Bolsheviks after the defeat of the Revolution of 1905-07. 
 The otzovists believed that under the prevailing conditions of reaction the Party should conduct only illegal activities. 
 They demanded the withdrawal of the Social-Democratic deputies from the Duma, and refused to take part in the work of the trade unions and other mass legal and semi-legal organisations. 
 The otzovists’ policy tended towards divorc-ing the Party from the masses and turning in into a sectarian organisation. 
 p. 
 266 Pochin (Initiative )—a journal of the Narodnik-liquidationist trend run by a group of Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
 Only a single issue was published in June 1912 in Paris. 
 p. 
 266 In the autumn of 1904 the editors of the Menshevik Iskra pub-lished a letter stating that the chief task of the Social-Democrats was to bring “organised pressure to bear on the bourgeois opposi-tion” by presenting demands to the government through the bour-geois liberals and Zemstvo people. 
 This “Zemstvo campaign plan” clearly revealed the Mensheviks’ lack of faith in the proletariat’s strength, in its ability to wage a political struggle and take inde-pendent revolutionary action. 
 From organisational opportunism the Mensheviks passed on to tactical opportunism, the “Zemstvo campaign plan” being the first step in this direction. 
 A detailed analysis and criticism of the Mensheviks’ plan is given by Lenin in “The Zemstvo Campaign and Iskra ’s Plan ”.

 269 The Bulygin Duma —a consultative Duma, the law for the convo-cation of which was drafted by A. 
 G. 
 Bulygin, Minister of the Interior, on instructions from the tsar. 
 The tsar’s Manifesto introducing the State Duma and the regulations governing the elections to it was published on August 6 (19), 1905. 
 Only land-lords, capitalists and a limited number of peasant householders were granted the right to vote in the Duma elections. 
 The Bolshe-viks boycotted the Bulygin Duma. 
 The government failed to convene it—it was swept away by the October general political strike. 
 The Witte Duma —the First Duma convened on April 27 (May 10), 1906, under the regulations drawn up by S. 
 Y. 
 Witte, Chair-man of the Council of Ministers. 
 Four hundred and seventy-eight deputies were elected to the First Duma, of whom 179 were Cadets, 63 Autonomists (includ-ing members of the Polish ko /o, and Ukrainian, Estonian, Lettish,133 134 136135 Lithuanian and other bourgeois-national groups), 16 Octobrists 105 non-party people, 97 Trudoviks and 18 Social-Democrats. 
Thus, over a third of the seats in the Duma were held by the Cadets. 
 The high point of the First Duma deliberations was the agrarian question. 
 Two basic agrarian programmes were put forward in the Duma—the Cadets’ Bill signed by 42 deputies, and the Tru-doviks’ Bill known as the “Bill of the 104”. 
 In contrast with theTrudoviks, the Cadets wanted to preserve landlordism, allowingalienation with compensation “at a fair price” of only those landedestates which were chiefly cultivated by the peasants’ implements or were rented out. 
 The First Duma was dissolved by the tsarist government on July 8 (21), 1906.

 273 At the session of the Duma on April 22 (May 5), 1914, the Rus-sian Social-Democratic Labour group (the Bolshevik Six), theSocial-Democratic Group (the Mensheviks) and the Trudoviksmoved that the budget debates should be adjourned pending theadoption of the Bill on the freedom of speech for deputies. 
 This motion was defeated by a majority of the Duma. 
 Thereupon the Bolsheviks, Mensheviks and Trudoviks used obstructionisttactics during the speech of Goremykin, Chairman of the Councilof Ministers. 
 Rodzyanko, Chairman of the Duma, retorted by sus-pending all the Social-Democrats and the Trudoviks from theDuma for fifteen sessions.

 The first twenty issues were prepared for the press andset up in Vyborg, but as conditions for the publication of an ille-gal organ in Russia became extremely difficult, further publica-tion was transferred abroad (Geneva and Paris). 
 Proletary was virtually the Central Organ of the Bolsheviks. 
 Most of the work on the paper was done by Lenin, several of whosearticles appeared in almost every issue. 
 Proletary published over a hundred articles and paragraphs by Lenin on the mostimportant issues of the revolutionary struggle of the workingclass.

 The newspaper was in close touch with the local Party organisations. 
 During the years of the Stolypin reaction Proletary played an outstanding role in safeguarding and strengthening the Bolshevikorganisations, in fighting the liquidators, otzovists, ultimatum-ists and god-builders.

 The organisation’s main object was to protect the autocratic system, the big landed estates, and the privileges of the nobility. 
 Lenin called the Council of the United Nobility “a council of united feudalists”. 
 The Council virtually became a semi-government body, which dictated to the government legislative measures aimed at protecting the interests of the feudalists. 
 A considerable number of its members were members of the Council of State and of the leading centres of the Black-Hundred organisations.

 While taking a Menshevik stand, the Plekhanovites at the same time stood for the preservation and strengthening of the illegal Party organi-sation and therefore stood for a bloc with the Bolsheviks.

 335 At the December meeting of the International Socialist Bureau (held in London on December 13-14, 1913) a resolution was adopt-ed instructing the Executive of the International Socialist Bureau to call a meeting of representatives of “all factions of the labour movement in Russia, including Russian Poland, who recognise the Party Programme or whose programme corresponds with that of the Social-Democrats, for a mutual exchange of opinions ( Aus-sprache ) on points of disagreement”. 
 In seconding this resolution, Kautsky, in his speech of December 14, stated that the old Social-Democratic Party in Russia was dead. 
 It had to be re-established on the basis of the Russian workers’ urge for unity. 
 In his article “A Good Resolution and a Bad Speech”, Lenin examined this resolution and called Kautsky’s speech monstrous.

 In 1608 the Polish troops under Pseudo-Dmitry II, a henchman of the Polish landed gentry who posed as the younger son of the Russian tsar Ivan the Terrible, invaded Russia, and reached the outskirts of Moscow, where they encamped in Tushino. 
 A govern-ment headed by Pseudo-Dmitry was formed in Tushino in oppo-sition to the government of Moscow. 
 Some of the Russian nobles and boyar aristocracy deserted one camp for another in an effort to keep in with the winning side. 
 These deserters were called “Tu-shino turncoats”.

 50, for March 30 (April 12), 1914 published the resolution of the Fourth Congress of the Social-Democrats of the Lettish Region concerning the split in the Social-Democratic group in the Fourth Duma. 
 The resolution stressed the need for unity of the Duma Social-Democratic Group on the basis of accept-ance of the Programme and Rules of the Party and the Party decisions. 
 (See pp. 
 177-81 of this volume. 
) In connection with this resolution of the Lettish Congress, the same issue of Put Pravdy published an “Open Enquiry” to the Menshevik deputies as to their attitude towards the principles advanced by the Lettish workers. 
 This enquiry of the Bolshevik newspaper was ignored by the Mensheviks. 
 Thereupon, the Russian Social-Democratic Labour group in the Duma published an “Open Letter’ in Put Pravdy No. 
 63 for April 17, 1914 in which they demanded from the Mensheviks a clear and definite reply to the question put to them. 
 The “Open Letter” evoked an “Open Reply” by the Mensheviks, which was published in Nasha Rabochaya Gazeta , May 4 (17). 
 This reply is dealt with in the present article.

 The agenda was to havebeen as follows: 1) The high cost of living, 2) Imperial-ism and the fight against militarism—including the subordinate questions: (a) the Eastern question, (b) compulsory courts of ar-bitration among nations, and c) the United States of Europe;3) Alcoholism, 4) Unemployment, 5) The position of politicalprisoners and exiles in Russia, and 6) Miscellanea. 
 The number of delegates was not to exceed the number of votes of the given country by more than sixfold. 
 Russia had 20 votes, consequently not more than 120 delegates for both subsections of the Social-Democrats and the Left Narodniks and for the tradeunions. 
 The question of the International Socialist Congress in Vienna was discussed at the Poronin meeting of the C.

 and Party work-ers. 
 Lenin made a report on this question, and proposed that every effort be made to send a majority of Social-Democratic worker delegates to the Vienna Congress. 
 Election of delegates to the International Socialist Congress was practically completed by the end of July 1914, but the out-break of war prevented the Congress from convening.

 Cunow. 
 Someof the writings of the founders of Marxism were first publishedin this journal, among them K. 
 Marx’s Critique of the Gotha Pro-gramme and Engels’s “Criticism of the Draft Social-Democratic Programme of 1891”. 
 Engels often gave pointers to the editors of Die Neue Zeit and criticised their deviations from Marxism.

 Beginning with the late nineties, after the death of Engels, the journal regularly published articles by revisionists,including a series of articles by E. 
 Bernstein “Problems of So-cialism”, which launched a revisionists’ campaign against Marx-ism. 
 During World War I the journal took a centrist stand andsupported the social-chauvinists.

 At first the rising was led by a Central National Committee formed by the petty-nobles’ party of the “Reds” in 1862. 
 Its programme demanding national independence for Poland, equal rights for all men in the land, irrespective of religion or birth, transfer to the peasants of the land tilled by them with full right of ownership and without re-demption payments, abolition of the corvée, compensation for the landlords for the alienated lands out of the state funds, etc. 
, at-tracted to the uprising diverse sections of the Polish population— artisans, workers, students, intellectuals from among the gentry, part of the peasantry and the clergy. 
 In the course of the insurrection, elements united around the party of the “Whites” (the party of the big landed aristocracy and the big bourgeoisie) joined it with the intention of using it in their own interests and, with the help of Britain and France, securing a profitable deal with the tsarist government. 
 The attitude of the revolutionary democrats of Russia towards the rebels was one of deep sympathy, the members of Zemlya i Volya secret society associated with N. 
 G. 
 Chernyshevsky trying to give them every possible assistance. 
 The Central Committee of Zemlya i Volya issued an appeal “To the Russian Officers and Soldiers”, which was distributed among the troops sent to suppress the insurrection. 
 A. 
 I. 
 Herzen and N. 
 P. 
 Ogaryov published a183 184 185 186 187 188 number of articles in Kolokol devoted to the struggle of the Polish people, and rendered material aid to the rebels. 
 Owing to the inconsistency of the party of the “Reds”, which failed to hold the revolutionary initiative, the leadership of the uprising passed into the hands of the “Whites”, who betrayed it. 
 By the summer of 1864, the insurrection was brutally crushed by the tsarist troops. 
 Marx and Engels, who regarded the Polish insurrection of 1863-64 as a progressive movement, were fully in sympathy with it and wished the Polish people victory in its struggle for national lib-eration. 
 On behalf of the German emigrant colony in London, Marx wrote an appeal for aid to the Poles.

 435The New York Daily Tribune —an American newspaper published from 1841 to 1924. 
 Until the middle fifties it was the organ of the Left wing of the American Whigs, and thereafter the organ of the Republican Party. 
 Karl Marx contributed to the paper from August 1851 to March 1862, and at his request Frederick Engels wrote numerous articles for it. 
 During the period of reaction that set in in Europe, Karl Marx and Frederick Engels used this widely circulated and at that time progressive newspaper to publish concrete material exposing the evils of capitalist society. 
 During the American Civil War Marx’s contributions to the newspaper stopped. 
 His break with The New York Daily Tribune was largely due to the growing influence on the editorial board of the advocates of compromise with the slave-owners, and the papers’s departure from progressive positions. 
 Eventually the newspaper swung still more to the right. 
 p. 
 439 Lenin is quoting from G. 
 V. 
 Plekhanov’s article “The Draft Pro-gramme of the Russian Social-Democratic Party” published in Zarya No. 
 4, 1902. 
 Zarya —a Marxist scientific and political journal published le-gally in Stuttgart in 1901-02 by the Editorial Board of Iskra . 
 Altogether four numbers (three issues) of Zarya appeared: No. 
 1 in April 1901 (actually on March 23, new style); No. 
 2-3 in De-cember 1901, and No. 
 4 in August 1902. 
 The aims of the publica-tion were set forth in the “Draft of a Declaration of the Editorial Board of Iskra and Zarya ” written by Lenin in Russia. 
 (See present edition, Vol. 
 4. 
) In 1902, during the disagreement and conflicts that arose on the Editorial Board of Iskra and Zarya , Plekhanov proposed a plan for separating the newspaper from the journal (with Zarya remaining under his editorship), but this proposal was not accepted, and the two publications continued under a single editorial board. 
189 190 191 192 Zarya criticised international and Russian revisionism, and defended the theoretical principles of Marxism. 
 The following articles by Lenin were published in this journal: “Casual Notes”, “The Persecutors of the Zemstvo and the Hannibals of Liberalism”, “The ‘Critics’ on the Agrarian Question” (the first four chapters of “The Agrarian Question and the ‘Critics of Marx’”), “Review of Home Affairs”, and “The Agrarian Programme of Russian So-cial-Democracy”, as well as Plekhanov’s articles “Criticism of Our Critics.

 In that action General Read commanded two divisions. 
 p. 
 450 Lenin is referring to the attack by the bourgeois counter-revolu-tion against the working class and the democratic petty bourgeoi-sie in France, after the latter’s defeat in June 1849. 
 The reference to 1871 is about the rising of the Paris workers on March 18, 1871, as a result of which a government of the pro-letarian dictatorship—the Paris Commune—was created for the first time in history. 
 The Commune was defeated. 
 “The entire bourgeoisie of France all the landlords, stockbrokers, factory owners, all the robbers great and small all the exploiters—united against it in savage fury. 
 (See present edition, Vol. 
 17, pp. 
 140-41. 
) With active aid from Bismarck, this coalition started military operations against insurgent Paris, and, on winning victory, flooded the streets of the city with the blood of the people. 
 No less than 30,000 Communards were killed and 50,000 arrested. 
 Many of these were executed and thousands were condemned to penal servitude or exile. 
 The Paris Commune is dealt with in Lenin’s articles: “Plan of a Lecture on the Commune”, “Lessons of the Commune”, “In Memory of the Commune”, The State and Revolution , Ch.

 456 The Peasant Union (The All-Russia Peasant Union)—a revolu-tionary-democratic organisation, which arose in 1905. 
 Influenced by the Socialist-Revolutionaries and liberals, the Peasant Union193 194 195 196 197 198 displayed a half-way policy, vacillations and indecision typical of the petty-bourgeoisie. 
 While demanding the abolition of land-lordism, the Union agreed to partial compensation for the land-lords. 
 In the words of Lenin, this was “organisation, sharing, of course, in a number of peasant prejudices, and susceptible to the petty-bourgeois illusions of the peasants (just like our Socialist-Revolutionaries); but it was undoubtedly a real organisation of the masses, of ‘men of the soil’, unquestionably revolutionary at bottom, capable of employing genuinely revolutionary methods of struggle. 
” (See present edition, Vol. 
 10, pp. 
 258-59. 
) From the very outset of its activities the Peasant Union was subject to po-lice repression and discontinued its activities early in 1907. 
 p. 
 462 L’Humanité —a daily newspaper founded in 1904 by Jean Jaurès as the organ of the French Socialist Party. 
 The newspaper hailed the beginning of the revolution in Russia in 1905 and expressed the sympathy of the French people “with the Russian nation, which was effecting its 1789”. 
 The newspaper organised collections in support of the Russian revolution. 
 During the First World War (1914-18) the paper was controlled by the extreme Right wing of the French Socialist Party and took a chauvinist stand. 
 In 1918, Marcel Cachin, a prominent leader of the French and international labour movement, became political director and head of the newspaper. 
 In 1918-20, the paper came out against the im-perialist policy of the French Government and its sending of armed forces against the Soviet Republic. 
 In December 1920, after the split in the French Socialist Party and the formation of the Communist Party of France, the newspaper became the latter’s Central Organ. 
 At the beginning of World War II, in August 1939, the newspa-per was banned by the French authorities and went underground. 
 During the Nazi occupation of France (1940-44) the newspaper appeared illegally, and played a tremendous role in the liberation of France. 
 In the-post-war period the newspaper has been waging a cease-less struggle for the country’s national independence, for unity of working-class action, for strengthening peace and friendship among the nations, and for democracy and social progress.

 Though he strongly disap-proved of this behaviour, Plekhanov refused to make the required statement, thereby justifying the slanderers. 
 Thereupon, the “Group of Marxists” published a “Statement” in the newspaper Trudovaya Pravda on June 5 (18), 1914, in which Plekhanov’s conduct was characterised as “an act of high diplomacy”.

 —the illegal newspaper Sotsial-Demokrat , published from February 1908 to January 1917. 
 Pre-pared by the Bolsheviks and partially printed in Vilna at a pri-vate press, the first issue was confiscated by the tsarist Okhranka (Secret Political Police). 
 Shortly afterwards another attempt to issue the newspaper was made in St. 
 Petersburg, but the bulk of the edition fell into the hands of the security police. 
 Further publication was arranged abroad. 
 Issues Nos. 
 2-32 (February 1909 to December 1913) appeared in Paris, Nos. 
 35-58 (November 1914 to January 1917) in Geneva. 
 Altogether fifty-eight issues were published, five of them with supplements. 
 According to the decision of the Central Committee of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 elected at the Fifth (London) Congress, the Editorial Board of Sotsial-Demokrat consisted of representatives of the Bolsheviks, Mensheviks and the Polish Social-Democrats. 
 Ac-tually, the paper was conducted by Lenin, whose articles were a central feature in it. 
 Over eighty articles and paragraphs by Lenin were published in the newspaper. 
 Lenin fought for a consistent Bolshevik line against the Menshe-vik liquidators on the Editorial Board of Sotsial-Demokrat . 
 Some of its members (Kamenev and Zinoviev) adopted a conciliatory attitude towards the liquidators and opposed Lenin’s line. 
 The Menshevik members of the editorial board—Martov and Dan— obstructed the work of the editorial staff of the Central Organ while at the same time openly defending liquidationism in Golos Sotsial-Demokrata ; they prevented the pro-Party Mensheviks from taking part in the work of the Central Organ. 
 Lenin’s un-compromising struggle against the liquidators led to Martov and Dan resigning from the editorial board in June 1911. 
 From December 1911 Sotsial-Demokrat was edited by Lenin. 
 During the grim years of reaction and the period of a new up-swing in the revolutionary movement Sotsial-Demokrat was a factor of tremendous importance in the Bolsheviks’ struggle against the liquidators, Trotskyists, and otzovists for the preservation of the illegal Marxist party, and strengthening its unity and con-tacts with the masses. 
203 204 205 206 During World War I Sotsial-Demokrat was the Central Organ of the Bolshevik Party, in which capacity it played a vital part in propagating Bolshevik slogans on the issues of war, peace and revolution. 
 The newspaper published Lenin’s article “The Slogan of a United States of Europe”, in which for the first time he for-mulated the conclusion that it was possible for socialism to win initially in a few or even in a single capitalist country. 
 The cir-culation of Sotsial-Demokrat in Russia and the reprinting of its most important articles in the local Bolshevik Papers contributed to the political enlightenment and international education of the Russian proletariat, and the preparation of the masses for the revolution. 
 Lenin highly appreciated the services that Sotsial-Demokrat rendered during World War I, and wrote later that “no class-conscious worker who wishes to understand the evolution of the idea of the international socialist revolution and its first victory of October 25, 1917” can dispense with a study of the articles published in it.

 490 “Appeal to the Ukrainian Workers ”, in the Ukrainian language signed by Ocksen Lola, and published in the newspaper Trudovaya Pravda No. 
 28 for June 29, 1914, called upon the workers to unite irrespective of nation in order to fight capital and to arrange for the publication under the auspices of Trudovaya Pravda of a “Uk-rainian Workers’ Leaflet”. 
 The “Appeal” was drafted by Lenin in Russian in the spring of 1914 and forwarded to O. 
 N. 
 Lola through Inessa Armand. 
 The “Appeal” was intended for the Miners ’ Leaflet —a supplement to the newspaper Put Pravdy . 
 Lenin considered it important for the “Appeal” to be issued by Lola in Ukrainian in order that a voice be raised precisely among the Ukrainian Social-Democrats calling for unity against the division of the workers by nation. 
 The “Ukrainian Workers ’ Leaflet ” was not published.

 delegation to the conference, namely, “Notes Privées ”, notes “Not for the Report” and letters on this question. 
 These documents illustrate Lenin’s struggle against Russian and international opportunism. 
 The Report marks an epoch in the development of Bolshevism in the period of reac-tion and the years of a new revolutionary upswing. 
 Concerned about the victory of the Bolsheviks over all the op-portunist trends and groups in the Russian working-class move-ment, the leadership of the Second International hastened to the assistance of these trends and groups. 
 With this aim in view the Brussels Conference was convened, ostensibly “to exchange opin-ions” on the question of the possibility of restoring unity in the207 208 R.

 Under the guise of establishing “peace” within the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
, the leaders of the International planned the liquidation of the independent Bolshevik Party, a party of a new type, which was conducting an irreconcilable struggle against opportunism in the Russian and international labour movement. 
 The Brussels “Unity ” Conference , convened by the Executive Committee of the I. 
S. 
B. 
 in accordance with the December 1913 decision of the Bureau’s meeting, was held on July 16-18, 1914. 
 The following were represented at the Conference: the Central Committee of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 (Bolsheviks); the Organising Com-mittee (Mensheviks) and its affiliated organisations (the Caucasian Regional Committee and the Borba group (Trotskyists)); the Duma Social-Democratic group (Mensheviks); Plekhanov’s Yedinstvo group; the Vperyod group; the Bund; the Social-Democrats of the Lettish Region; the Social-Democrats of Lithuania, the Polish Social-Democrats; the Polish Social-Democratic opposition; and the P. 
S. 
P. 
 (Left wing). 
 The C.

 of the R. 
S.

L. 
P. 
 sent a delegation to the Conference, consisting of Inessa Armand (Petrova), M. 
 F. 
 Vladimirsky (Kam-sky), and I. 
 F. 
 Popov (Pavlov). 
 Lenin thoroughly prepared the delegation of the C. 
C. 
 for the Conference. 
 He wrote for it the Report and detailed instructions, and supplied it with the neces-sary materials, documents and factual data revealing the Russian opportunists and their inspirers in their true colours. 
 Lenin was in the closest touch with the delegation, whose work he directed from Poronin. 
 From the very outset the Conference was marked by a very sharp struggle of the Bolsheviks against the Russian and inter-national opportunists. 
 At Kautsky’s proposal the Conference adopted the following agenda: 1. 
 Programmatic differences; 2. 
 Tactical differences; 3. 
 The organisational question. 
 Although the Conference was to have been confined only to an exchange of opinions, Vandervelde warned the delegates that the Conference would adopt decisions on all three items of the agenda. 
 On Lenin’s instructions, the C. 
C. 
’s delegation proposed that the Conference should hear reports by the delegations and the concrete terms which each of them con-sidered essential for unity. 
 Because of the Bolsheviks’ persistence it was decided to waive the agenda and proceed to the reports on the questions at issue, and to the formulation by the delegations of concrete conditions for unity. 
 The highlight of the Conference was the Report of the C. 
C. 
 of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
, as written by Lenin, which was read by Inessa Armand in French at the morning session on July 17. 
 The leaders of the I. 
S. 
B. 
 did not allow the full text of the Report to be read so that Armand was obliged to set forth only part of it and proceed to the terms for unity. 
 As formulated by Lenin these terms met with indignant protests from the opportunists, Plekhanov declar-ing that these were not terms for unity, “but articles of a new criminal code”. 
 Martov, Alexinsky, Yonov, Semkovsky and others shouted that the report of the C. 
C. 
 characterised the “intolerance of the Leninists”, that “the Leninists had no right to call themselves ‘Bolsheviks’”, that the “terms” were “a mockery of the Inter-national”, and so on. 
 On behalf of the I. 
S. 
B. 
, Kautsky proposed a resolution for the unification of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 which affirmed that within Russian Social-Democracy there were no essential disagreements standing in the way of unity. 
 Kautsky was supported by the Organising Committee and by Plekhanov, who violently attacked the C. 
C. 
 and Lenin. 
 Rosa Luxemburg took an erroneous stand by joining Plekhanov, Vandervelde, Kautsky and others in advocating unity between the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks. 
 Since the Con-ference was not authorised to pass resolutions, the Bolsheviks and the Lettish Social-Democrats refused to take part in the voting, but the resolution of the I. 
S. 
B, was carried by a majo-rity. 
 The Polish opposition, which joined the Bolsheviks and Lettish Social-Democrats at the Conference, voted for the reso-lution of the I. 
S. 
B. 
 Guided by Lenin, the Bolsheviks refused to accept the decisions of the Brussels Conference. 
 The attempt by the Second Internation-al’s opportunist leaders to liquidate the Bolshevik Party met with failure. 
 In the sight of the international proletariat, Lenin and the Bolsheviks exposed the true aims of the leaders of the International, who wore the mask of peacemakers. 
 For their capable and vigorous defence of the Party line, the Central Commit-tee passed a vote of thanks to the C. 
C. 
 delegation at the Brussels Conference. 
 At a private meeting of the liquidators, Trotskyists, Vperyodists, Plekhanovites, Bundists and representatives of the Caucasian Regional organisation held after the Brussels Conference, these groups formed a bloc against the Bolsheviks. 
 The Brussels (“Third of July”) bloc served as a hypocritical screen concealing the polit-ically rotten position of all its participants. 
 The bloc shortly afterwards fell apart, showing how false the policy of the Russian and West-European “uniters” of the R.

 495 The Anti-Socialist Law was introduced in Germany in 1878 by the Bismarck government with the object of combating the labour and socialist movement. 
 The law banned all Social-Democratic Party and mass working-class organisations, and the labour press; socialist literature was confiscated, and Social-Democrats were hounded and deported. 
 These repressions, however, did not break the Social-Democratic Party, which readjusted its activities to the conditions of illegal existence: the Party’s central organ So-zial-Demokrat was published abroad and Party congresses were held regularly there (1880, 1883, and 1887); in Germany, Social-Democratic underground organisations and groups headed by an illegal Central Committee were rapidly restored. 
 Simultane-ously, the Party made wide use of legal opportunities to strengthen contact with the masses, and its influence steadily grew. 
 The number of votes cast for the Social-Democrats in the Reichstag elections increased more than threefold between 1878 and 1890. 
209 Tremendous assistance to the German Social-Democrats was given by Karl Marx and Frederick Engels. 
 The Anti-Socialist Law was repealed in 1890 as a result of pressure from the mounting mass labour movement.
