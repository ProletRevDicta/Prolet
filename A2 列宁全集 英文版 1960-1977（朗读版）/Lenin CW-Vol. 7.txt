 1903 Reduced This account is intended for personal acquaintances only , and therefore to read it without the consent of the author(Lenin ) is tantamount to reading other people’s letters . 
 In order to make what follows more intelligible, I shall first say a few words about the composition of the Congress, although it will mean anticipating somewhat. 
 The numberof votes at the Congress was fifty-one (thirty-three delegateswith one vote each, and nine with two, nine “double-hand-ers”). 
 2 There were ten delegates, if I am not mistaken, with a deliberative voice but no vote; that is, fifty-two per-sons in all. 
 The political grouping of these votes, as revealed during the entire course of the Congress, was as follows: five Bundists,3 three Rabocheye Dyelo -ists4 (two from the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad5 and one from the St. 
 Petersburg League of Struggle6), four Yuzhny Rabochy -ists (two from the Yuzhny Rabochy group7 and two from the Kharkov Committee, which sided solidly with Yuzhny Rabochy ), six indecisives or waverers (the “Marsh”, as they were called by all the Iskra -ists8—in jest, of course), and, lastly, about thirty-three Iskra -ists who were more or less firm and consistent in their Iskra -ism. 
 These thirty-three Iskra -ists, who when they stood together decided every issue at the Congress, split in their turn into two subgroups—a split that took shape finally only towardsthe end of the Congress: one subgroup, with approximatelynine votes, consisting of Iskra -ists of the “soft or rather zigzag line” (or the female line, as certain wits called it,and not without reason)— Iskra -ists who stood (as will be seen later) for justice, for a middle course, etc. 
; and the other, with about twenty-four votes, consisting of Iskra -ists of the firm line, who upheld consistent Iskra -ism both as regards tactics and as regards the personal composition of the central institutions of the Party. 
 I repeat that this grouping took final shape and became quite clear only post factum , towards the end of the Con-gress (which held close on forty sittings!), and I am antic-ipating when I outline it at the start. 
 I must also makethe reservation that this grouping only represents theapproximate numbers of votes, for on various minor issues (and on one occasion—on the question of “equality of lan-guages”, of which I shall speak later—on a major issuetoo) the votes not infrequently split, some delegates abstain-ing, the groups intermingling, and so on. 
 The composition of the Congress had been preliminarily determined by the Organising Committee, 9 which, under the Regulations for the Congress, had the right to invite to it in a deliberative capacity such persons as it mightthink fit. 
 The Congress itself at the very beginning electeda Credentials Committee, which thereafter took charge ofall matters relating to its composition. 
 (Let me say in pa-renthesis that on this committee too there was a Bundist, who tried to take all the other members of it by siege, keep-ing them up until three o’clock in the morning, and who,even so, entered a “dissenting opinion” on every issue . 
) The Congress was marked at the beginning by the peace-ful and harmonious co-operation of all the Iskra -ists; there had always been different shades of opinion among them, of course, but they had never manifested themselves as polit-ical differences. 
 Incidentally, let us state in advance thatthe split among the Iskra -ists was one of the major political results of the Congress, and anyone who wants to acquainthimself with the matter should therefore pay special atten-tion to all episodes even remotely connected with that split. 
 One rather important event at the very beginning of the Congress was the election of the Bureau , or Presidium . 
 Martov was for electing nine persons, who would selectthree from their number to act as the Bureau at each sitting,and he even suggested a Bundist as one of the nine. 
 I was for electing only three persons for the whole duration of the Congress, and three, moreover, who would “keep order”. 
The Bureau elected consisted of Plekhanov, myself and Comrade T10 (a firm-line Iskra -ist and member of the Organising Committee, of whom we shall have frequent occasion to speak later). 
 The last-named, I might remark, was elected by only a narrow margin in preference to aYuzhny Rabochy -ist (also a member of the Organising Com-mittee). 
 My difference with Martov over the question of theBureau (a difference significant in the light of subsequentevents) did not, however, lead to any split or conflict: the matter was somehow settled in a peaceful, natural, “homely” way, as most questions generally were settled in the Iskra organisation and the Iskra editorial board. 
 Also at the beginning of the Congress, there was a meeting of the Iskra organisation (confidential and informal, of course) on the subject of its Congress mandates. 
 This meeting likewise settled its business in a peaceful and amicable man-ner. 
 I only mention this meeting because I think it signif-icant, firstly, that at the beginning of the Congress theIskra -ists worked together harmoniously, and, secondly, that they had decided to appeal, in doubtful and debatablecases, to the authority of the Iskra organisation (or, rather, of the Iskra organisation members present at the Congress); although the decisions of these meetings-were not binding,of course, for the rule that “binding instructions are abol-ished” and that it was everyone’s right, and indeed duty, tovote at the Congress according to his own free convictions,without owing obedience to any organisation—this rule, I say, was recognised by all the Iskra -ists, and was loudly proclaimed by the chairman at the beginning of practicallyevery meeting of the Iskra organisation. 
 To proceed. 
 The first incident at the Congress to disclose that all was not well among the Iskra -ists, an incident that “set the scene” for the final drama (or tragicomedy?), was the celebrated “ incident of the Organising Committee ”. 
 This must be dealt with at length. 
 It occurred while the Con-gress was still engaged in constituting itself and discussing itsStanding Orders (which, by the way, consumed a tremendousamount of time on account of the obstruction of the Bundists,who, deliberately or otherwise, never missed an opportunity to cause delay). 
 The substance of the Organising Committee incident was that, on the one hand, that body had, evenbefore the Congress opened, rejected the protest of the Borba group,11 which demanded representation at the Congress, and had stood by this decision in the Credentials Committee; and, on the other hand, on the floor of the Congress this same Organising Committee suddenly declared that it was invit-ing Ryazanov in a deliberative capacity. 
 The course ofevents in regard to this incident was as follows. 
 Before the sittings of the Congress began, Martov con-fidentially informed me that a certain member of the Iskra organisation and of the Organising Committee (whom we shall call N 12) had decided to insist in the Organising Committee that it invite to the Congress in a deliberativecapacity a certain individual whom Martov himself couldnot describe otherwise than as a “renegade”. 
 13 (And it was true that this individual had inclined at one time towards Iskra but afterwards, within a few weeks, in fact, had gone over to Rabocheye Dyelo , even though the latter was already in a state of complete degeneration. 
) Martov and I discussedthe matter and we were both indignant that a member ofthe Iskra organisation should do such a thing, knowing, of course (for Martov had warned Comrade N), that it was a direct slap in the face for Iskra , yet not considering it neces-sary even to consult the organisation. 
 N did in fact put for-ward his proposal in the Organising Committee, but it wasrejected owing to the vigorous protest of Comrade T, whodescribed the wholly unstable political character of the“renegade”. 
 It is worth noting that Martov, as he said, could not even speak any longer to N, although they had previously been on friendly personal terms, so shocked was he by thisaction. 
 N’s wish to put spokes in Iskra ’s wheel was further revealed in his supporting a vote of censure passed by theOrganising Committee on the Iskra editorial board; a cen-sure which, to be sure, concerned a very minor matter, but which nevertheless aroused Martov’s profound indignation. 
 Furthermore, information from Russia, also communicatedto me by Martov, indicated a tendency on N’s part to cir-culate rumours of dissension between the Iskra -ists in Russia and the Iskra -ists abroad. 
 All this disposed the Iskra -ists to be very distrustful of N; and on top of it all came the following. 
 The Organising Committee had rejected the pro-test of Borba; the Organising Committee members attendingthe meeting of the Credentials Committee (T and N) had both ( including N!!!) likewise spoken in the most emphatic terms against Borba. 
 Yet during an adjournment at one of the morning sittings of the Congress, the Organising Commit-tee suddenly held a meeting of their own “by the window”and decided to invite Ryazanov in a deliberative capacity!N was i n f a v o u r of inviting him . 
 T, of course, was cate-gorically against, declaring moreover that the OrganisingCommittee had no right to make such a decision inasmuch as everything relating to the composition of the Congress had already been referred to the Credentials Committee speciallyelected by the Congress for the purpose. 
 Of course, theYuzhny Rabochy members of the Organising Committee # the Bundist # N outvoted Comrade T, and the decision went through. 
 T reported this decision to the Iskra editorial board, which (not all its members were present, but Martov and Zasulichwere) unanimously decided, of course, to take the field atthe Congress against the Organising Committee, for manyIskra -ists had already spoken publicly at the Congress against Borba and it was impossible to yield on this issue. 
 When the Organising Committee (after the dinner inter-val) informed the Congress of its decision, T, in his turn,informed it of his protest. 
 Thereupon a Yuzhny Rabochy member of the Organising Committee fell upon T and accusedhim of violating discipline (1), on the grounds that theOrganising Committee had resolved not to disclose ( sic!) this fact to the Congress. 
 Naturally, we (Plekhanov, Martov and I) came down hard on the Organising Committee atthat, accusing it of reviving binding instructions, violatingthe sovereignty of the Congress, and so on. 
 The Congresssupported us, the Organising Committee was defeated, and aresolution was adopted depriving the Organising Committee as a body of the right to influence the composition of the Congress. 
 Such was the “Organising Committee incident”. 
 Firstly, it finally undermined the political confidence of manyIskra -ists in N (and strengthened their confidence in T); secondly, it not only proved, but palpably demonstrated how shaky the Iskra trend still was even in a central and, as it seemed, super-Iskra -ist institution like the Organising Committee. 
 It became clear that, besides the Bundist, the Organising Committee included 1) Yuzhny Rabochy -ists with their own specific policy, and 2) “ Iskra -ists who were ashamed of being Iskra -ists”, and that only some of its members were 3) Iskra -ists who were not ashamed of being such. 
 When the Yuzhny Rabochy -ists expressed a desire to discuss this deplorable incident with the Iskra editorial board (privately, of course)— Comrade N , it is very important to note , expressed no desire at that time to do so —the editorial board did discuss it with them, and I plainly told them that the Congress had definitely revealedan important political fact, namely, that there were manyIskra -ists in the Party who were ashamed of being Iskra -ists and were capable, just to spite Iskra , of playing such a trick as inviting Ryazanov. 
 So angry was I at this trick on N’s part, after he had spoken against Borba in the com-mittee, that I publicly declared at the Congress that “com-rades who have attended foreign congresses know whata storm of indignation is always aroused when people sayone thing at committees and another on the floor of theCongress”. 
 * “Iskra -ists” who were afraid of being “reproached” by the Bundists with being “ Iskra puppets”, and who for this reason alone played political tricks on Iskra , naturally could not inspire any confidence. 
 The Iskra -ists’ general distrust of N grew immensely when Martov’s attempt to discuss the matter with him resultedin N’s announcing his resignation from the “Iskra ” organi-sation ! Thereafter the N “affair” was taken up in the Iskra organisation, whose members were outraged by such a res-ignation, and the organisation held four meetings on the subject. 
 These meetings, especially the last, are extremelyimportant, for it was there that the split among the Iskra -ists, chiefly over the composition of the Central Committee, definitely took shape. 
 But before embarking on an account of these meetings of the Iskra organisation (which, I once more repeat, were private and informal), let me say something about the workof the Congress. 
 That work proceeded harmoniously for thetime being, in the sense of all the Iskra -ists acting together, *See present edition, Vol. 
 6, p. 
 484. 
— Ed. 
 both on the first agenda item (the position of the Bund in the Party), and on the second (the programme), and on the third (endorsement of the Central Organ of the Party). 
 The united stand of the Iskra -ists ensured a big and solid majority at the Congress (a compact majority, as the Bundists ruefully called it!), although here too the “indecisives”(or “Marsh”) and Yuzhny Rabochy -ists more than once displayed, on minor issues, their utter instability. 
 The political grouping of not fully Iskra -ist elements at the Congress stood out more and more clearly. 
 To return to the meetings of the Iskra organisation. 
 At the first of them it was resolved to request N to givean explanation, leaving it to him to say before whom of themembers of the Iskra organisation he wished to do so. 
 I protested emphatically against this approach, demanding that the political issue (the Iskra -ists’ lack of political confidence in N at this Congress) be separated from thepersonal issue (the appointment of a commission to in-vestigate the reasons for N’s strange conduct). 
 At the secondmeeting it was announced that N wished to give his expla-nation without T present , although he did not intend, he intimated, to say anything about T personally. 
 I again pro-tested and refused to be present at an explanation at whicha non-member of the organisation could demand the with-drawal, even for a moment, of a member, when it was not thatmember he was going to discuss. 
 I considered this an un-worthy manoeuvre and a slap in the face for the organisation on N’s part: N did not even trust the organisation so far as toleave it to it to determine under what conditions theexplanation should be given! At the third meeting, N gavehis “explanation”, which failed to satisfy the majority of those present. 
 The fourth meeting was attended by all the Iskra -ists; but it was p r e c e d e d by a number of impor-tant episodes at the Congress itself. 
 First of all, mention should be made of the “equality of languages” episode. 
 It concerned the adoption of the pro-gramme—the formulation of the demand for equality andequal rights in regard to language. 
 (The programme was discussed and voted on point by point, the Bundists engaged in desperate obstruction, and practically two-thirds of the time of the Congress was spent on the programme!) On this issue the Bundists succeeded in shaking the unity of the Iskra -ists, leading some of them to believe that Iskra objected to “equality of languages”, when actually all the Iskra editorial board objected to was this illiterate, in its opinion, bizarre and superfluous formula. 
 A desperatestruggle ensued, and the Congress was split in half , into two equal halves (with a few abstentions): about twenty-three votes (perhaps 23-25, I do not remember exactly) were on the side of Iskra (and the Iskra editorial board), and as many were against. 
 The question had to be postponed,it was referred back to the committee, which found a for-mula that the Congress adopted u n a n i m o u s l y . 
 The equality of languages incident is important because it oncemore revealed the shakiness of Iskra -ism, plainly and defi-nitely revealed the shakiness both of the indecisives (it was then, if I am not mistaken, that they were dubbed theMarsh , and by none other than the Iskra -ists of the Martov persuasion!) and of the Yuzhny Rabochy -ists, who were all against Iskra . 
 Passions ran high and innumerable cutting remarks were flung at the Yuzhny Rabochy -ists by the Iskra -ists, especially the Martovites . 
 One “leader” of the Martovites nearly came to blows with the Yuzhny Rabochy -ists during the interval, and I hastened to resume thesitting (at the urgent request of Plekhanov, who feared ascuffle). 
 It is important to note that among these twenty-three staunchest of the Iskra -ists too, the Martovites (i. 
e. 
, the Iskra -ists who subsequently followed Martov) constituted a m i n o r i t y . 
 Another episode was the struggle over Paragraph 1 of the “Party Rules”. 
 This was already the fifth item of theTagesordnung , * towards the end of the Congress. 
 (Under Item 1, a resolution against federalism was adopted; under Item 2, the programme; under Item 3, Iskra was adopted as the Central Organ of the Party; ** under Item 4, the “dele-*Agenda. 
— Ed. 
 **It is highly important to note that the Congress Tagesordnung , adopted, on my report, by the Organising Committee and endorsed by the Congress , contained two separate items: Item 3 : “Establishment of the Central Organ of the Party, or endorsement of such”, and Item 24 : “Election of the central institutions of the Party”. 
 When one of the Rabocheye Dyelo -ists asked (in connection with Item 3) what it was gates’ reports” were heard, part of them, that is, the rest being referred to a committee, for the time at the disposal of the Congress was already too short—both funds and endurance had been exhausted. 
) Paragraph 1 of the Rules defines a Party member. 
 The definition given in my draft was: “A member of the RussianSocial-Democratic Labour Party is one who accepts its pro--gramme and who supports the Party both financially and by personal participation in one of the Party organisations . 
” In place of the words I have underlined, Martov proposed:“work under the control and direction of one of the Party organisations ”. 
 My formulation was supported by Plekhanov, Martov’s by the rest of the editorial board (Axelrod wastheir spokesman at the Congress). 
 We argued that the con-cept Party member must be narrowed so as to separate those who worked from those who merely talked, to eliminate or-ganisational chaos, to eliminate the monstrous and absurdpossibility of there being organisations which consisted ofParty members but which were not Party organisations,and so on. 
 Martov stood for broadening the Party and spoke of a broad class movement needing a broad—i. 
e. 
, diffuse— organisation, and so forth. 
 It is amusing to note that indefence of their views nearly all Martov’s supporters citedWhat Is To Be Done? * Plekhanov hotly opposed Martov, pointing out that his Jaurèsist formulation would fling openthe doors to the opportunists, who just longed for such a position of being inside the Party but outside its organi-sation. 
 “Under the control and direction”, I said, would in we were endorsing, just a name?—we didn’t even know who the edi-tors were to be!— M a r t o v took the floor and explained that what was being submitted for endorsement was the Iskra t r e n d , irre-spective of persons, and that this would in no way predetermine the composition of the editorial board, for the election of the central institutions would follow under Item 24, and all binding instructionshad been abolished. 
 These words of Martov’s (on Item 3, before the “Iskra ”-ists had split ) are of the utmost importance. 
 The explanation Martov gave fully accorded with our common understanding of the meaning of Item 3 and Item 24 of the Tagesordnung . 
 After Item 3 Martov in his speeches at the Congress actually em-ployed, time and again, the expression: the ex-members of the Iskra editorial board.

 practice mean nothing more nor less than without any control or direction . 
 Martov won : his formulation was adopted (by about twenty-eight votes to twenty-three, or something like that—I cannot recall exactly), thanks to the Bund, which, of course, at once sensed a loophole and broughtall its five votes to bear to secure the adoption of “the worse alternative” (that is precisely how a Rabocheye Dyelo dele-gate explained his motive for voting for Martov!). 
 The heated controversy and the voting on Paragraph 1 of the Rules once more revealed the political grouping at theCongress and demonstrated that the Bund # Rabocheye Dyelo could decide the fate of any issue by supporting the minority of the Iskra -ists against the majority. 
 It was after the debate and voting on Paragraph 1 of the Rules that the fourth (and last) meeting of the Iskra organisation took place. 
 The disagreement among theIskra -ists over the personal composition of the Central Committee had already become quite clear and had causeda split in their ranks: one section stood for an Iskra -ist Central Committee (in view of the dissolution of the Iskra organisation and the Emancipation of Labour group 14 and the need to complete Iskra ’s work), the other—for admitting the Yuzhny Rabochy -ists too and for predominance of Iskra -ists of the “zigzag line”. 
 The first section was categor-ically against N’s candidature, the other in favour of it. 
It was in a last attempt to reach agreement that this meeting of the sixteen (members of the Iskra organisation, including, I repeat, those present in a deliberative capacity) wascalled. 
 The result of the voting was: nine against N,four in favour, the rest abstaining. 
 The majority, anxiousnonetheless to avoid war with the minority, thereuponproposed a compromise list of five, including one Yuzhny Rabochy -ist (acceptable to the minority) and one militant member of the minority, while the rest were consistentIskra -ists (of whom—it is important to note—one joined in the fight at the Congress only towards the end and was toall intents and purposes impartial, while the other two tookno part at all in the fight and were absolutely impartial as regards personalities). 
 Ten hands were raised for this list (then one more was added, making eleven) and one against(only Martov’s!), the rest abstained! Thus the compromise list was wrecked by Martov . 
 After this, two “militant” lists, one from each side, were put to the vote, but neither secured more than a minority. 
 And so, at the last meeting of the Iskra organisation the Martovites proved in the minority on both issues ; never-theless, when a member of the majority (the above-mentionedimpartial member, or chairman) approached them afterthe meeting in a last attempt to reach agreement, they declared war. 
 The Martovites’ calculation was clear and sure: the Bundists and Rabocheye Dyelo -ists would undoubtedly have supported the list of the zigzag line , for during the month the Congress had been sitting all issues had become so plainand all personalities so clearly delineated that not one o f the Congress delegates would have had any difficulty in deciding which was the better alternative, or the lesserevil. 
 And for the Bund # Rabocheye Dyelo , of course, the zigzag Iskra -ists were the lesser evil, and always will be. 
 After the meeting of the sixteen, when the Iskra -ists had definitely divided and war had been declared among them, meetings began of the two parties into which theCongress had split, that is, private and unofficial gatheringsof all who thought alike. 
 The Iskra -ists of the consistent line assembled at first to the number of nine (out of sixteen),then fifteen, and finally twenty-four , counting votes , not persons . 
 This rapid increase was due to the fact that the lists of candidates (for the Central Committee) were alreadybeginning to circulate, and the vast majority of the Iskra -ists were immediately and permanently repelled by theMartovite lists because of their flabbiness: Martov’s candi-dates were people who had made a definitely bad impression on the Congress (by paltering, inconsistency, tactlessness, etc. 
). 
 That in the first place; in the second place, whenit was explained to the Iskra -ists what had taken place in the Iskra organisation, the bulk of them were drawn towards the majority, and Martov’s inability to stick to a definitepolitical line became apparent to all and sundry. 
 So it was that twenty-four votes were quickly and easily mustered for the consistent Iskra -ist tactics, for the list of Central Committee candidates, and for electing a trio to the editorial board (instead of endorsing the old, ineffectual and amorphous board of six). 
 By this time the Congress had finished discussing the Rules, and Martov and Co. 
 had once again (and not once,in fact, but several times) defeated the majority of the Iskra -ists with the generous assistance of the Bund # “Rabocheye Dyelo ”—as, for example, over the question of co-optation to the central bodies (this question was decided by the Congress along Martov ’s lines ). 
 In spite of having been thus impaired, the Rules as a whole were endorsed by all the Iskra -ists and by the entire Congress. 
 But after the general Rules, the Congress passedon to the Rules of the Bund, and by an overwhelming majority rejected the Bund’s proposal (to recognise the Bund as the sole representative of the Jewish proletariat in the Party). 
 I think on this issue the Bund stood alone againstpractically the whole Congress. 
 Thereupon the Bundists withdrew from the Congress , announcing their withdrawal from the Party . 
 The Martovites had lost five of their faithful allies! Then the Rabocheye Dyelo -ists too withdrew, after the League of Russian Revolutionary Social-Democracy Abroad 15 was recognised as the sole Party organisation abroad. 
 The Martovites had lost another two of their faithful allies!The total number of votes at the Congress was now forty-four (51—7), of which the majority (twenty-four) were those of consistent Iskra -ists; the coalition of the Martovites with the Yuzhny Rabochy -ists and the “Marsh” resulted in only twenty votes. 
 The Iskra -ists of the zigzag line were faced with the pros-pect of submitting—just as the Iskra -ists of the firm line had submitted without a murmur when Martov set out to beat and did beat them in coalition with the Bund. 
 But the Martovites were so unbridled that instead of submitting they set out to cause a row and a split. 
 It was causing a row to raise the question of endorsing the old editorial board, for the request of even one of theeditors would be enough to oblige the Congress to scrutinise the question of the composition of the Central Organ in its entirety, instead of confining itself to mere endorsement. 
 It was a step towards a split to refuse to take part in the elections to the Central Organ and the Central Committee. 
 First as regards the election of the editorial board. 
 As I have already mentioned, what the Tagesordnung said, in Item 24, was: election of the central institutions of the Party. 
 And my commentary on the Tagesordnung16 (which commentary was known t o a l l t h e “Iskra ”-ists long before the Congress and to all the delegates at the Congress) said marginally: election of t h r e e p e r s o n s t o t h e C e n t r a l O r g a n and three to the Central Committee. 
 Hence it is beyond all doubt that the demand for the election of a trio originated within the editorial board itself and noneof the editors protested against it. 
 Even Martov and anotherMartovite leader defended the proposal for “two trios”prior to the Congress, before a number of delegates . 
 Several weeks before the Congress, I personally informed Starover 17 and Martov that at the Congress I would demand the election of the editorial board; I agreed to the election of two trios, the idea being that the editorial trio wouldeither co-opt seven (or even more) persons or would remain as it was (I specially stipulated this latter possibility). 
Starover even said outright that the trio would mean Plekhanov # Martov # Lenin, and I agreed with him—so clear had it been to everyone all along that these alone couldbe elected to the leadership. 
 One had to be actuated byresentment and pique and lose one’s head after the struggleat the Congress to proceed after the event to attack the trioas inexpedient and ineffectual. 
 The old board of six was so ineffectual that never once in all its three years did it meet in full force. 
 That may seem incredible, but it is a fact. 
Not one of the forty-five issues of Iskra was made up (in the editorial and technical sense) by anyone but Martov orLenin. 
 And never once was any major theoretical issue raised by anyone but Plekhanov. 
 Axelrod did no work at all (he contributed literally nothing to Zarya 18 and only three or four articles to all the forty-five issues of Iskra ). 
 Zasulich and Starover only contributed and advised, they never did any actual editorial work. 
 Who ought to be elected tothe political leadership , to the c e n t r e , was as clear as daylight to every delegate at the Congress, after the month it had been in session. 
 To propose at the Congress to endorse the old editorial board was a stupid attempt to provoke a row . 
 It was stupid because it was futile. 
 Even if the board of six had been endorsed, one member of it (myself, for example) would have demanded that it be reviewed, that the relations within it be examined, and the Congress would have beenobliged to go into the matter all over again. 
 It was an attempt to provoke a row because non-endorse-ment was bound to be taken a s a n i n s u l t —whereas in a new election there was nothing insulting whatever. 
 The Central Committee was being elected—why not the Central Organ too? There was no question of endorsing theOrganising Committee—why should there be any of endors-ing the old editorial board? Naturally, however, by demanding endorsement the Mar-tovites provoked a protest at the Congress, the protest was taken as an insult , as an affront, as an attempt to oust them, to shut them out ... and all the bogy-tales began to beinvented on which the fancy of idle gossips is nowfeeding! The editorial board left the hall while the Congress dis-cussed the election-or-endorsement issue. 
 After a desperately hot debate, the Congress decided n o t t o e n d o r s e t h e o l d e d i t o r i a l b o a r d. 
 * Only after this decision was taken did the ex-members of the editorial board return to the hall. 
 Martov then got upand, in his own name and that of his colleagues, declined to stand for election, uttering all sorts of dreadful and wretched words about a “state of siege in the Party” (for blackballed Ministers?) and “emergency laws against par-ticular individuals and groups” (such as those who, in thename of Iskra , try to palm off Ryazanov on it, and who say one thing at committees and another on the floor of theCongress?). 
 I replied to him by pointing to the incredible confusion of political ideas which had led to this protest against elec-tion, against the Congress making changes in official Partybodies. 
 ** *One Martovite made such a speech on this occasion that when he had finished a delegate called out to the secretary: “Don’t put afull stop, put a tear-drop!” Particularly fervent in their championshipof the old editorial board were the most inveterate “ Marsh ” men. 
 **See present edition, Vol. 
 6, pp.

— Ed. 
 Plekhanov, Martov, and Lenin were elected. 
 Martov again declined . 
 Koltsov (who received three votes) likewise declined. 
 Thereupon the Congress passed a resolution instructing the two members of the editorial board of theCentral Organ to co-opt a third, when they should find a suitable person. 
 Next came the election of three members to the Central Committee— the name of only one of whom was disclosed to the Congress by the teller of the votes—and of the fifth member of the Party Council 19 (likewise by secret ballot). 
 The Martovites, followed by the whole of the “Marsh”, would not hand in their ballots and submitted a written state-ment to the Bureau to that effect. 
 This was manifestly a step towards a split, towards wrecking the Congress and refusing to recognise the Party. 
 Yet when one of the Yuzhny Rabochy -ists said in so many words that he doubted (sic!) the validity of the Congress decisions, Martov, overcome by shame, controverted him,publicly declaring that he had no doubt as to their validity . 
 Unfortunately, these well-spoken and loyal words have been contradicted by the actions and behaviour of Martov (and of the Martovites).... 
 The Congress then entrusted the publication of the min-utes to a Minutes Committee, and adopted eleven resolu-tions on tactical questions, viz. 
: 1) On Demonstrations; 2) On the Trade Union Movement; 3) On Work Among the Sects;4) On Work Among the Student Youth;5) On How To Behave Under Interrogation; 6) On Shop Stewards; 7) On the 1904 International Congress in Amsterdam; 8) On the Liberals (Starover’s resolution); 9) On the Liberals (Plekhanov’s resolution), 10) On the Socialist-Revolutionaries 20; 11) On Party Literature. 
 Then, after a brief speech reminding the delegates that the decisions of the Congress were binding, the chairman closed the Congress. 
 Examining the behaviour of the Martovites since the Congress, their refusal to collaborate on the Central Organ (although officially invited by the editorial board to do so ), their refusal to work on the Central Committee, and their propaganda of a boycott—all I can say is that this is aninsensate attempt, unworthy of Party members, to disruptthe Party—and why? Only because they are dissatisfied with the composition of the central bodies; for, speaking objectively , it was o n l y over this that our ways parted, while their subjective verdicts (insult, affront, slurs,ousting, shutting out, etc. 
, etc. 
) are nothing but the fruits of offended vanity and a morbid imagination. 
 This morbid imagination and offended vanity are leading directly to the most disgraceful scandal-mongering , when, without yet knowing or seeing anything of the activities of the new central bodies , people spread rumours about their being “ineffectual”, about Ivan Ivanovich “ruling with a rodof iron” or Ivan Nikiforovich 21 with an “iron hand”, and so on. 
 To try to prove that the central bodies are “ineffectual” by boycotting them is an unprecedented and unparalleled violation of Party duty , and no sophistry can conceal the fact: the boycott is a step towards disrupting the Party . 
 The Russian Social-Democratic movement is in the throes of the last difficult transition from the circles to a Party , from philistinism to a realisation of revolutionary duty , from acting by means of scandal-mongering and circle pressure to discipline . 
 Anyone who values Party work and action in the interests of the Social-Democratic labour movement will refuse totolerate such wretched sophistries as a “legitimate” and“loyal” boycott of the central bodies; he will not allow the cause to suffer and the work to be brought to a standstill because a dozen or so individuals are displeased that theyand their friends were not elected to the central bodies;he will not allow Party officials to be subjected to privateand secret pressure through threats of non-collaboration,through boycotts, through cutting off of funds, through scandal-mongering and lying tales. 
 FOILED! “Well, and what if your sonorous, bombastic and florid assurances should inspire distrust because of their verynature?” “I should like to see who would dare doubt my word!” “But still, suppose it is doubted?”“I repeat, I will not allow anyone to doubt the word of a revolutionary, I shall stop at nothing, I shall go toany length, I shall demand either a direct expression ofdisbelief or a direct withdrawal, I.... 
” “What if your demand for a direct expression of disbelief is accepted?” “What do you mean?”“What if you are told plainly and bluntly that you are not believed?” “I shall proclaim the man who dares say that a gross slanderer, I shall publicly brand his unparalleled conduct.... 
” “But what if in reply he begins to show point by point that your whole behaviour has long since made it impossibleto trust you?” “I shall go about everywhere collecting protests against this fratricidal controversy, I shall make emotional speeches about truth and justice, about crystal purity soiled by unclean hands, about the coarse and sordid husk of pettyvanity, about the purifying flame which fills my soul witha supreme enthusiasm. 
 I shall liken my enemies to PontiusPilate.... 
” “And suppose they liken you to Tartuffe for such talk?” “In that case I shall demand a court of arbitration!” “You will at once be told that your challenge is gladly accepted, and asked to agree that the court examine whether your adversary had legitimate grounds for doubting your statements. 
” “In that case ... in that case ... I shall declare that ‘ after all that has happened ’ it is ridiculous to talk of any ‘ agree-ment ’ between the ‘ parties concerned ’!” * * * Such was what Revolutsionnaya Rossiya22 calls “the unparalleled campaign over the affair of April 2”. 
23 For very understandable reasons, that worthy publication hatesto admit that that is what happened. 
 It takes refuge in awhole series of subterfuges, which we shall have to examinein detail. 
 Firstly, Revolutsionnaya Rossiya is surprised that, “instead of the organised Russian Social-Democratic movement”,to which Balmashov’s friends addressed their statement, itis the Iskra editorial board that replies. 
 Balmashov’s friends, we are told, “have received no answer to their quitedefinite offer, addressed to a quite definite quarter”. 
 That is not so, gentlemen. 
 Like everyone else, you know very well what the organised Russian Social-Democraticmovement consists of, you know all the organisations we have. 
 Unlike some other people, we do not have new organi-sations springing up overnight. 
 We have our Party com-mittees, we have Iskra , we have the Organising Committee, which has for some time been making preparations for the Second Congress of the Party. 
 Just to which “definite quarter”did you address yourselves? To the Second Congress?To the Organising Committee? No, though you talk of adefinite quarter, you said absolutely nothing to define that quarter. 
 You yourselves say that Iskra is recognised by the majority of the committees; consequently, no one could answer you but Iskra . 
 If the Second Congress of our Party adopts Iskra as the Party organ, then Iskra ’s reply will be the reply of the Party. 
 If not, you will have some otherorgan to deal with. 
 That is simple enough for a child of sixto understand. 
 Revolutsionnaya Rossiya is “surprised that, instead of a plain answer to the plain offer of Balmashov’s friends”(an offer, supposedly, to give the Social-Democrats the opportunity to acquaint themselves with the true facts of the affair of April 2), “it is proposed that they should regard themselves and Iskra as two parties between whom there could, after aIl that has happened, be some kind of preliminarynegotiations or ‘agreements’ as to the presentation of theissue”. 
 And so, Revolutsionnaya Rossiya now asserts that we were not offered a court of arbitration, but only anopportunity of acquainting ourselves. 
 That is not so. 
 The “Statement” in No. 
 27 of Revolutsionnaya Rossiya speaks literally of an “uninvestigated charge of slander” (againstIskra ), of having an investigation of the charge, of submit-ting “the following evidence to a person on whose integrity and secrecy both we and the Central Organ [mark that!]of the Russian Social-Democratic Party could rely”. 
 “Inves-tigation of the charge”, “examination of evidence” by a per-son on whom both accuser and accused can rely—what isthat but a court of arbitration? Is that only an offer toacquaint ourselves with the facts?? You are a comic lot,gentlemen. 
 After calling upon us to agree about selectinga person of integrity, you now declare with the inimitable lofty air of a Nozdrev 24 caught red-handed that no agree-ment is possible! Revolutsionnaya Rossiya “further asks whom Iskra i s trying to make a fool of when it talks about an agreementas to the presentation of the issue, and in the same breathdecrees its own presentation and categorically asserts that no other is possible”. 
 In court, everyone categorically asserts his own opinion and claims that it is the only correct one. 
Instead of in turn giving his own definite presentation of the issue, our haughty opponent begins to bluster and makefine speeches! After a certain amount of bluster, however, Revolu-tsionnaya Rossiya condescends to make also a few remarks about our presentation of the issue. 
 In its opinion, Iskra is dodging and retreating. 
 It isn’t, we are told, as if “theCombatant Organisation denied Iskra ’s right to have its own free opinion [!], to judge political acts from its ownpoint of view, or even [ sic!] to have its private doubts about anything it liked”. 
 This “private doubts” is really priceless! The “Combatant Organisation” is so extraordinarily broad-minded as to be prepared (now, after a year and more of warfare!) to permit us even to doubt—but only privately, that is, presumably, in such a way that no one but the doubt-er shall know anything about it.... 
 Perhaps when these com-batant people allow us to hold our own “free opinion” theyalso mean us to do so privately? “One might think,” Revolutsionnaya Rossiya says, “that it was only Iskra ’s refusal to accede to this demand that was the reason for accusing it of slander. 
” Then follow quotations from the article “Tartuffes of Revolutionary Morality” and the remark that “what we have here is not modest and indefinitedoubts, but very immodest and very definite charges”. 
 We invite our readers to recall certain generally known facts. 
 In No. 
 20 of Iskra (May 1, 1902), we give our opinion of Balmashov’s act, without having the slightest idea of the existence of any combatant organisation. 
 The latter thereupon writes us a letter demanding that we seek themotives for Balmashov’s decision in its official statements. 
We silently drop this letter from an unknown organisationinto the wastepaper basket. 
 The letter is then published inRevolutsionnaya Rossiya , No. 
 7 (June 1902), the editors of which, for no other reason than our silence, begin to cry that a slur has been cast on the moral aspect, that the significanceof the act is being belittled, and so on. 
 We reply with anarticle entitled “An Enforced Controversy” ( Iskra , No. 
 23, August 1, 1902), in which we laugh at this angry Jupiter,uphold our opinion of the act of April 2, and declare that in our view it is “more than doubtful” whether Balmashov be-longed to any “combatant organisation”. 
 Thereupon Messieursthe Socialist-Revolutionaries, having extorted from us apublic expression of our private doubts, raise an hystericaloutcry about “unparalleled conduct” and talk about nothingless than “mud-slinging” and “insinuations” ( Revolutsion-naya Rossiya , No. 
 11, September 1902). 
 Such, in the briefest outline, are the main facts of our press controversy. 
 Someone who knows very well that hisopponent regards his utterances with silent distrust pub-licly forces him to the wall and demands an open expressionof either belief or disbelief, and when he gets the latter answer, beats his breast and complains urbi et orbi * what a *To the world at large. 
— Ed. 
 noble creature he is and how shamefully he has been insulted. 
 What is this but Nozdrev conduct? What is it but revolutionary swashbuckling? Did not such a person deserve to be called a Tartuffe? Where does Revolutsionnaya Rossiya get the idea that we are retreating and refuse to answer for our article and forthe articles about Tartuffes? Is it from the fact that in ourpresentation of the issue we do not set forth the theses of these articles? But was the arbitration offer issued in con-nection with any particular articles—was it not rather inconnection with Iskra ’s general attitude towards the assurances of the “Socialist-Revolutionary Party”? Do notBalmashov’s friends, at the very beginning of their state-ment in No. 
 27 of Revolutsionnaya Rossiya , cite precisely the starting-point of the whole controversy, namely, Iskra ’s remark, in No. 
 23, that in its view it was more than doubtfulwhether Balmashov belonged to any “combatant organisa-tion”? We make so bold as to assure Revolutsionnaya Ros-siya that we answer for all our articles; that we are prepared to supplement our questions for the arbitration court by references to any issue of Iskra ; that we are ready to prove to anyone that we had every moral right and valid reason todescribe as Tartuffes those on Revolutsionnaya Rossiya who, on account of our presumptuous doubts as to theveracity of that paper’s utterances, indulged in the expres-sions we have quoted. 
 “Dodging and retreating”—yes, but on whose part? Is it not on the part of those who are now magnanimously prepared to recognise our right to a free opinion and to pri-vate doubts, after indulging for over a year in disgusting bombast against Iskra for stubbornly persisting in its doubts and maintaining that every serious person was in duty bound to have doubts about revolutionary romancing? When you saw that your emotional talk about probity andhonour actually moved your hearers to laughter, not tears,you decided you must have a new sensation, and came outwith your demand for an arbitration court. 
 The scandal-loving element in the colonies abroad rubbed their hands with glee and went about eagerly whispering: “They have summoned them to court ... at last! Now we shall see!” Andnow they have seen—have seen the last act of a vaudeville, whose hero, with an ineffable air of injured innocence, declares that “after all that has happened” no agreements as to the presentation of the issue to the court are possible. 
 Just carry on in the same spirit, gentlemen! But bear in mind that no torrents of wretched words will prevent usfrom discharging our duty of exposing phrase-mongering andmystification wherever they may occur—whether in the“programmes” of revolutionary adventurers, or in the tinsel of their romancing, or in grandiloquent sermons about truth and justice, purifying flames, crystal purity, andall the rest.

{ { THE TASKS OF THE REVOLUTIONARY YOUTH FIRST LETTER26 The editorial statement of the newspaper Student ,27 which, if we are not mistaken, was first published in No. 
 4 (28) of Osvobozhdeniye ,28 and which was also received by Iskra , is indicative in our opinion of a considerable advance in the editors’ views since the appearance of the first issueof Student . 
 Mr. 
 Struve was not mistaken when he hastened to express his disagreement with the views set forth in thestatement: those views do indeed differ radically from the trend of opportunism so consistently and zealously main-tained by the bourgeois-liberal organ. 
 By recognising that“revolutionary sentiment alone cannot bring about ideolog-ical unity among the students”, that “this requires a so-cialist ideal based upon one or another socialist worldoutlook” and, moreover, “a definite and integral” outlook, the editors of Student have broken in principle with ideolog-ical indifference and theoretical opportunism, and haveput the question of the way to revolutionise the students ona proper footing. 
 True, from the current standpoint of vulgar “revolution-ism”, the achievement of ideological unity among the students does not require an integral world outlook, but rather precludes it, involving a “tolerant” attitude towardsthe various kinds of revolutionary ideas and abstention frompositive commitment to some one definite set of ideas; inshort, in the opinion of these political wiseacres, ideologicalunity presupposes a certain lack of ideological principles (more or less skilfully disguised, of course, by hackneyed formulas about breadth of views, the importance of unityat all costs and immediately, and so on and so forth). 
 A rather plausible and, at first glance, convincing argument always produced in support of this line of reasoning is to point to the generally known and incontrovertible fact that among the students there are, and are bound to be, groupsdiffering greatly in their political and social views, and todeclare that the demand for an integral and definite worldoutlook would therefore inevitably repel some of thesegroups and, consequently, hinder unity, produce dissension instead of concerted action, and hence weaken the power of the common political onslaught, and so on and so forth,without end. 
 Let us examine this plausible argument. 
 Let us take, for example, the division of students into groups given inNo. 
 1 of Student . 
 In this first issue the editors did not yet advance the demand for a definite and integral world outlook, and it would therefore be difficult to suspect themof a leaning towards Social-Democratic “narrowness”. 
 Theeditorial in the first issue of Student distinguishes four major groups among the present-day students: 1) the indif-ferent crowd—“persons completely indifferent to the student movement”; 2) the “academics”—those who favour student movements of an exclusively academic type; 3) “op-ponents of student movements in general—nationalists,anti-Semites, etc. 
”; and 4) the “politically minded”—thosewho believe in fighting for the overthrow of tsarist des-potism. 
 “This group, in turn, consists of two antithetical elements—those belonging to the purely bourgeois political opposition with a revolutionary tendency, and those whobelong to the newly emerged [only newly emerged?—N. 
 Lenin ] socialistically minded revolutionary intellectual proletariat. 
” Seeing that the latter subgroup is dividedin its turn, as we all know, into Socialist-Revolutionary students and Social-Democratic students, we find that there are among the present-day students six political groups: reactionaries, indifferents, academics, liberals, Socialist-Revolutionaries and Social-Democrats. 
 The question arises: is this perhaps an accidental group-ing, a temporary alignment of views? That question has only to be raised for anyone at all acquainted with the matter to answer it in the negative. 
 And, indeed, there couldnot be any other grouping among our students, because they are the most responsive section of the intelligentsia, and the intelligentsia are so called just because they most consciously, most resolutely and most accurately reflect and express the development of class interests and politicalgroupings in society as a whole. 
 The students would notbe what they are if their political grouping did not cor-respond to the political grouping of society as a whole—“correspond” not in the sense of the student groups and the social groups being absolutely proportionate in strength and numbers, but in the sense of the necessary and inevi-table existence among the students of the same groups as insociety. 
 And Russian society as a whole, with its (relatively)embryonic development of class antagonisms, its politicalvirginity, and the crushed and downtrodden condition of the vast, overwhelming majority of the population under the rule of police despotism, is characterised by pre-cisely these six groups, namely: reactionaries, indifferents,uplifters , liberals, Socialist-Revolutionaries and Social-Democrats. 
 For “academics” I have here substituted “up-lifters”, i. 
e. 
, believers in law-abiding progress without a political struggle, progress under the autocracy. 
 Such uplifters are to be found in all sections of Russian society,and everywhere, like the student “academics”, they confinethemselves to the narrow range of professional interests,the improvement of their particular branches of the nationaleconomy or of state and local administration; everywhere they fearfully shun “politics”, making no distinction (as the academics make none) between the “politically minded”of different trends, and implying by the term politicseverything that concerns ... the form of government. 
 Theuplifters have always constituted, and still constitute, thebroad foundation of our liberalism: in “peaceful” times (i. 
e. 
, translated into “Russian”, in times of political reaction) the concepts uplifter and liberal become practically synony-mous; and even in times of war, times of rising public feeling,times of mounting onslaught on the autocracy, the distinc-tion between them often remains vague. 
 The Russianliberal, even when he comes out in a free foreign publication with a direct and open protest against the autocracy, never ceases to feel that he is an uplifter first and foremost, andevery now and again he will start talking like a slave, or, if you prefer, like a law-abiding, loyal and dutiful subject— vide Osvobozhdeniye . 
 The absence of a definite and clearly discernible border-line between uplifters and liberals is a general characteristicof the whole political grouping in Russian society. 
 Wemight be told that the above division into six groups isincorrect because it does not correspond to the class divisionof Russian society. 
 But such an objection would be unfound-ed. 
 The class division is, of course, the ultimate basis of the political grouping; in the final analysis , of course, it always determines that grouping. 
 But this ultimate basisbecomes revealed only in the process of historical develop-ment and as the consciousness of the participants in and mak-ers of that process grows. 
 This “final analysis” is arrived at only by political struggle, sometimes a long, stubborn struggle lasting years and decades, at times breaking outstormily in the form of political crises, at others dying downand, as it were, coming temporarily to a standstill. 
 Not fornothing is it that in Germany, for example, where the polit-ical struggle assumes particularly acute forms and where the progressive class—the proletariat—is particularly class-conscious, there still exist such parties (and powerful par-ties at that) as the Centre, whose denominational bannerserves to conceal its heterogeneous (but on the whole decid-edly anti-proletarian) class nature. 
 The less reason is thereto be surprised that the class origin of the present-day polit-ical groups in Russia is strongly overshadowed by the polit-ically disfranchised condition of the people as a whole, bythe domination over them of a remarkably well organised,ideologically united and traditionally exclusive bureau-cracy. 
 What is surprising, rather, is that Russia’s develop-ment along European capitalist lines should already, despite her Asiatic political system, have made so strong a mark on the political grouping of society. 
 In our country too, the industrial proletariat, the pro-gressive class of every capitalist country, has already en-tered on the path of a mass, organised movement led bySocial-Democracy, under the banner of a programme which has long since become the programme of the class-conscious proletariat of the whole world. 
 The category of peoplewho are indifferent to politics is of course incomparably larger in Russia than in any European country, but even in Russia one can no longer speak of the primitive and prime-val virginity of this category: the indifference of the non-class-conscious workers—and partly of the peasants too—isgiving place more and more often to outbursts of politicalunrest and active protest, which clearly demonstrate thatthis indifference has nothing in common with the indiffer-ence of the well-fed bourgeois and petty bourgeois. 
 This latter class, which is particularly numerous in Russia owing to her still relatively small degree of capitalist devel-opment, is already unquestionably beginning, on the onehand, to produce some conscious and consistent reactionaries;but on the other hand, and immeasurably more often, it isstill little to be distinguished from the mass of ignorant and downtrodden “toiling folk” and draws its ideologues from among the large group of raznochintsy 29 intellectuals, with their absolutely unsettled world outlook and unconsciousjumble of democratic and primitive-socialist ideas. 
 It isjust this ideology that is characteristic of the old Russianintelligentsia, both of the Right wing of its liberal-Narodnik section and of the most Leftward wing: the “Socialist-Revolutionaries”. 
 I said the “old” Russian intelligentsia. 
 For a new intel-ligentsia, whose liberalism has almost entirely sloughedoff primitive Narodism and vague socialism (not withoutthe help of Russian Marxism, of course), is already making its appearance in our country. 
 The formation of a real bour-geois-liberal intelligentsia is proceeding in Russia withgiant strides, especially owing to the participation in thisprocess of people so nimble and responsive to every oppor-tunist vogue as Messrs. 
 Struve, Berdyaev, Bulgakov & Co. 
As regards, lastly, those liberal and reactionary elements of Russian society who do not belong to the intelligentsia, their connection with the class interests of one or anothergroup of our bourgeoisie or landowners is clear enough toanyone at all acquainted, say, with the activities of ourZemstvos, 30 Dumas, stock-exchange committees, fair committees, etc. 
 And so, we have arrived at the indubitable conclusion that the political grouping of our students is not accidental, but is bound to be such as we have depicted above, in con-currence with the first issue of Student . 
 Having established that fact, we can easily cope with the controversial questionof what, actually, should be understood by “achievingideological unity among the students”, “revolutionising”the students, and so on. 
 It even seems very strange at first glance that so simple a question should have proved contro-versial. 
 If the political grouping of the students correspondsto the political grouping of society, does it not follow ofitself that “achieving ideological unity” among the studentscan mean only one of two things: either winning over thelargest possible number of students to a quite definite set of social and political ideas, or establishing the closest possible bond between the students of a definite political groupand the members of that group outside the student body. 
 Isit not self-evident that one can speak of revolutionising thestudents only having in mind a perfectly definite contentand character of this revolutionising process? To the Social-Democrat, for example, it means, firstly, spreading Social-Democratic ideas among the students and combatingideas which, though called “Socialist-Revolutionary”, havenothing in common with revolutionary socialism; and, sec-ondly, endeavouring to broaden every democratic studentmovement, the academic kind included, and make it more conscious and determined. 
 How so clear and simple a question was confused and rendered controversial is a very interesting and very char-acteristic story. 
 A controversy arose between Revolutsion-naya Rossiya (Nos. 
 13 and 17) and Iskra (Nos. 
 31 and 35) over the “Open Letter” of the Kiev Joint Council of United Fraternities and Student Organisations (printed in Revo-lutsionnaya Rossiya , No. 
 13, and in Student , No. 
 1). 
 The Kiev Joint Council characterised as “narrow” the decisionof the Second All-Russian Student Congress of 1902 thatstudent organisations should maintain relations with thecommittees of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party; and the quite obvious fact that a certain section of the students in certain localities sympathise with the “Socialist-Revolutionary Party” was nicely covered up by the very “impartial” and very unsound argument that “the students as such cannot associate themselves in their entirety with either the Socialist-Revolutionary Party or the Social-Democratic Party”. 
 Iskra pointed to the unsoundness of this argument, but Revolutsionnaya Rossiya , of course, flew to arms in its defence, calling the Iskra -ists “fanatics for divisions and splits” and accusing them of “tactlessness”and lack of political maturity. 
 After what has been said above, the absurdity of such an argument is only too apparent. 
 The question at issueis the particular political role the students should play. 
And, don’t you see, you must first shut your eyes to thefact that the students are not cut off from the rest ofsociety and therefore always and inevitably reflect the political grouping of society as a whole, and then, with eyes thus shut, proceed to chatter about the students as such, orthe students in general. 
 The conclusion arrived at is ... theharmfulness of divisions and splits resulting from associa-tion with a particular political party. 
 It is clear as daylightthat in order to carry this curious argument to its conclusion, the arguer had to leap from the political plane to the occu-pational or educational plane. 
 And it is just such a flyingleap that Revolutsionnaya Rossiya makes in the article “The Students and Revolution” (No. 
 17), talking, firstly, aboutgeneral student interests and the general student struggleand, secondly, about the educational aims of the students, the task of training themselves for future social activity and developing into conscious political fighters. 
 Both thesepoints are very just—but they have nothing to do with thecase and only confuse the issue. 
 The question under discussionis political activity, which by its very nature is connected inseparably with the struggle of parties and inevitably involves the choice of one definite party. 
 How, then, can one evade this choice on the grounds that all political activity requires very serious scientific training, the “development”of firm convictions, or that no political work can be confined to circles of politically minded people of a particular trend,but must be directed to ever broader sections of the popula-tion, must link up with the occupational interests of every section, must unite the occupational movement with thepolitical movement and raise the former to the level of the latter?? Why, the very fact that people have to resort to such devices in order to defend their position shows how sadly they themselves are wanting both in definite scientific convictions and in a firm political line! From whatever sideyou approach the matter, you find fresh confirmationof the old truth which the Social-Democrats have longpropounded in condemning the efforts of the Socialist-Revolutionaries to balance themselves—as regards both scientific theory and practical politics—between Marxism, West-European “critical” opportunism and Russian petty-bourgeois Narodism. 
 * Indeed, imagine a state of things where political relations are at all developed and see how our “controversial question”looks in practice. 
 Suppose there is a clerical party, a liberal party and a Social-Democratic party. 
 In certain localities they function among certain sections of the students, letus say, and, perhaps, of the working class. 
 They try to winover as many as possible of the influential representativesof both. 
 Is it conceivable that they would object to theserepresentatives choosing one definite party on the grounds that there are certain general educational and occupational interests common to all the students and to the entireworking class? That would be like disputing the fact thatparties must contend on the grounds that the art of printingis useful to all parties without distinction. 
 There is no partyin the civilised countries that does not realise the tremendous value of the widest and most firmly established educational and trade unions; but each seeks to have its own influencepredominate in them. 
 Who does not know that talk aboutthis or that institution being non-partisan is generallynothing but the humbug of the ruling classes, who want togloss over the fact that existing institutions are already imbued, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, with a very definite political spirit? Yet what our Socialist-Revolu-tionaries do is, in effect, to sing dithyrambs to “non-parti-sanship”. 
 Take, for example, the following moving tirade *It need hardly be said that the thesis that the programme and tactics of the Socialist-Revolutionaries are inconsistent and inherentlycontradictory requires special detailed elucidation. 
 We hope to gointo this in detail in a subsequent letter. 
 /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR in Revolutsionnaya Rossiya (No. 
 17): “What short-sighted tactics it is when a revolutionary organisation is determined to regard every other independent, non-subordinate organi-sation as a competitor that must be destroyed and into whose ranks division, disunity, and disorganisation must at allcosts be introduced!” This was said in reference to the 1896appeal of the Moscow Social-Democratic organisation, whichreproached the students for having in recent years with-drawn into the narrow confines of their university interests, and which Revolutsionnaya Rossiya admonished, saying that the existence of student organisations never preventedthose who had “crystallised as revolutionaries” from devotingtheir energies to the workers’ cause. 
 Just see how much confusion there is here. 
 Competition is possible (and inevitable) only between a political organi-sation and another political organisation, a political tendencyand another political tendency. 
 There can be no competi-tion between a mutual aid society and a revolutionarycircle; and when Revolutsionnaya Rossiya ascribes to the latter the determination to destroy the former, it is talking sheer nonsense. 
 But if in this same mutual aid society there develops a certain political tendency—not to aid revolution-aries, for instance, or to exclude illegal books from thelibrary—then every honest “politically minded” person isin duty bound to compete with it and combat it outright. 
 If there are people who confine the circles to narrow univer-sity interests (and there undoubtedly are such people, and in 1896 there were far more!), then a struggle between them and the advocates of broadening, not narrowing, the inter-ests is similarly imperative and obligatory. 
 And, mindyou, in the open letter of the Kiev Council, which evokedthe controversy between Revolutsionnaya Rossiya and Iskra , the question was of a choice not between student organisa-tions and revolutionary organisations, but between revolu-tionary organisations of different trends. 
 Consequently, itis people already “crystallised as revolutionaries” thathave begun to choose , while our “Socialist-Revolutionaries” are dragging them back , on the pretext that competition between a revolutionary organisation and a purely student organisation is short-sighted.... 
 That is really too senseless,gentlemen! The revolutionary section of the students begin to choose between two revolutionary parties, and are treated to this lecture: “It was not by imposing a definite [indefiniteness is preferable, of course...] party label [a label to some, abanner to others], it was not by violating the intellectualconscience of their fellow-students [the entire bourgeois pressof all countries always attributes the growth of Social-Democracy to ringleaders and trouble-makers violating the conscience of their peaceable fellows...] that this influence was achieved”, i. 
e. 
, the influence of the socialist sectionof the students over the rest. 
 Assuredly, every honest-mindedstudent will know what to think of this charge againstthe socialists of “imposing” labels and “violating consciences”. 
And these spineless, flabby and unprincipled utterances are made in Russia, where ideas of party organisation, of party consistency and honour, of the party banner are stillso immeasurably weak! Our “Socialist-Revolutionaries” hold up as an example to the revolutionary students the earlier student congresses,which proclaimed their “solidarity with the general polit-ical movement, leaving quite aside the factional dissen-sions in the revolutionary camp”. 
 What is this “generalpolitical” movement? The socialist movement plus theliberal movement. 
 Leaving that distinction aside meanssiding with the movement immediately nearest, that is, theliberal movement. 
 And it is the “Socialist-Revolutionaries” who urge doing that! People who call themselves a separate party urge dissociation from party struggle! Does not thisshow that that party cannot convey its political wares underits own colours and is obliged to resort to contraband?Is it not clear that that party lacks any definite program-matic basis of its own ? That we shall soon see. 
 The errors in the Socialist-Revolutionaries’ arguments about the students and revolution cannot be attributedmerely to the lack of logic that we have tried to demonstrateabove. 
 In a certain sense it is the other way round: the illogicality of their arguments follows from their basic error. 
 As a “party” they from the first adopted so inher-ently contradictory, so slippery a stand that people who were quite honest and quite capable of political thinking could not maintain it without constantly wobbling and falling. 
 It should always be remembered that the Social-Democrats do not ascribe the harm done by the “Socialist-Revolutionaries” to the socialist cause to various mistakeson the part of individual writers or leaders. 
 On the contrary,they regard all these mistakes as the inevitable consequenceof a false programme and political position. 
 In a matter like the student question this falsity is particularly apparent and the contradiction between a bourgeois-democratic view-point and a tinselled covering of revolutionary socialismbecomes manifest. 
 Indeed, examine the train of thought inRevolutsionnaya Rossiya ’s programmatic article “The Students and Revolution”. 
 The author’s main emphasis is on the “unselfishness and purity of aims”, the “force of idealistic motives” of the “youth”. 
 It is here that he seeks the explana-tion of their “innovatory” political strivings, and not in theactual conditions of social life in Russia, which, on the onehand, produce an irreconcilable antagonism between theautocracy and very broad and very heterogeneous sections of the population and, on the other, render (soon we shall have to be saying: rendered) extremely difficult any mani-festation of political discontent except through the univer-sities. 
 The author then turns his guns on the attempts of the Social-Democrats to react consciously to the existence of different political groups among the students, to bring about closer unity of like political groups and to separatethe politically unlike. 
 It is not that he criticises as incor-rect any of these attempts in particular—it would beabsurd to maintain that all of them were always whollysuccessful. 
 No, he is a stranger to the very idea that differ-ing class interests are bound to be reflected in the political grouping too, that the students cannot be an exception tosociety as a whole, however unselfish, pure, idealistic, etc. 
,they may be, and that the task of the socialist is not to glossover this difference but, on the contrary, to explain it aswidely as possible and to embody it in a political organisa-tion. 
 The author views things from the idealist standpoint of a bourgeois democrat, not the materialist standpoint ofa Social-Democrat. 
 He is therefore not ashamed to issue and reiterate the appeal to the revolutionary students to adhere to the “general political movement”. 
 The main thing for him is precisely the general political, i. 
e. 
, the general democratic,movement, which must be united. 
 This unity must not beimpaired by the “purely revolutionary circles”, which mustalign themselves “parallel to the general student organisa-tion”. 
 From the standpoint of the interests of this broad and united democratic movement, it would be criminal, of course, to “impose” party labels and to violate the intellectualconscience of your fellows. 
 This was just the view of thebourgeois democrats in 1848, when attempts to point to theconflicting class interests of the bourgeoisie and the prole-tariat evoked “general” condemnation of the “fanatics for divisions and splits”. 
 And this too is the view of the latest variety of bourgeois democrats—the opportunists andrevisionists, who yearn for a great united democratic partyproceeding peaceably by way of reforms, the way of classcollaboration. 
 They have always been, and must necessarilybe, opponents of “factional” dissensions and supporters of the “general political” movement. 
 As you see, the arguments of the Socialist-Revolution-aries, which from the standpoint of a socialist are illogicaland contradictory to the point of absurdity, become quiteunderstandable and consistent when viewed from thestandpoint of the bourgeois democrat. 
 That is because the Socialist-Revolutionary Party is, actually, nothing but a subdivision of the bourgeois democrats, a subdivision which in its composition is primarily intellectual, in its stand-point is primarily petty-bourgeois, and in its theoreticalideas eclectically combines latter-day opportunism withold-time Narodism. 
 The best refutation of the bourgeois democrat’s phrases about unity is the course of political development and ofthe political struggle itself. 
 And in Russia the growth ofthe actual movement has already led to this kind of refuta-tion. 
 I am referring to the emergence of the “academics” asa separate group among the students. 
 As long as there was no real struggle, the academics did not stand out from the “general student” mass, and the “unity” of the whole “think-ing section” of the students appeared inviolable. 
 But as soon as it came to action , the divergence of unlike elements became inevitable. 
 * The progress of the political movement and of the direct onslaught on the autocracy was immediately marked bygreater definiteness of political grouping—despite all theempty talk about uniting anybody and everybody. 
 Thatthe separation of the academics and the politically mindedis a big step forward, hardly anyone, surely, will doubt. 
 But does this separation mean that the Social-Democratic students will “break” with the academics? Revolutsionnaya Rossiya thinks that it d oes (see No. 
 17, p. 
 3). 
 But it thinks so only because of the confusion of ideas which we have brought out above. 
 A complete demarca-tion of political trends in no wise signifies a “break-up” of the occupational and educational unions. 
 A Social-Democrat who sets out to work among the students will unfailingly endeavour to penetrate, either himself or through his agents,into the largest possible number of the broadest possible“purely student” and educational circles; he will try tobroaden the outlook of those who demand only academic freedom, and to propagate precisely the Social-Democratic programme among those who are still looking for a programme. 
 To sum up. 
 A certain section of the students want to acquire a definite and integral socialist world outlook. 
The ultimate aim of this preparatory work can only be—forstudents who want to take practical part in the revolu-tionary movement—the conscious and irrevocable choice of one of the two trends that have now taken shape among therevolutionaries. 
 Whoever protests against such a choiceon the plea of effecting ideological unity among thestudents, of revolutionising them in general, and so forth, isobscuring socialist consciousness and is in actual fact preaching absence of ideological principles. 
 The political grouping of the students cannot but reflect the politicalgrouping of society as a whole, and it is the duty of every *If certain reports are to be credited, a further divergence of the unlike elements among the students is becoming increasinglymarked, namely, dissociation of the socialists from political revolutio-naries who refuse to hear of socialism. 
 It is said that this latter trend is very pronounced among the students exiled to Siberia. 
 We shall see if these reports are confirmed. 
 socialist to strive for the most conscious and consistent demarcation of politically unlike groups. 
 The Socialist-Revolutionary Party’s appeal to the students to “proclaim their solidarity with the general political movement andleave quite aside the factional dissensions in the revolu-tionary camp” is, essentially, an appeal to go back , from the socialist to the bourgeois-democratic standpoint. 
 Thisis not surprising, for the “Socialist-Revolutionary Party” is only a subdivision of the bourgeois democrats in Russia. 
 When the Social-Democratic student breaks with therevolutionaries and politically minded people of all othertrends, this by no means implies the break-up of the generalstudent and educational organisations. 
 On the contrary,only on the basis of a perfectly definite programme can and should one work among the widest student circles to broaden their academic outlook and to propagate scientific social-ism, i. 
e. 
, Marxism. 
 P. 
 S. 
 In subsequent letters I should like to discuss with the readers of Student the importance of Marxism in moulding an integral world outlook, the differences between the prin-ciples and tactics of the Social-Democratic Party and the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, the problems of studentorganisation, and the relation of the students to the workingclass generally.

, and gave our opinion of it. 
 The Foreign Committee of the Bund replies at great length and with great heat in its leaflet of September 9 (22). 
 The most materialpart of this angry reply is the following phenomenal revela-tion: “ In addition to its maximum Rules [sic!], the Fifth Congress of the Bund also drew up minimum Rules ”; and these minimum Rules are quoted in full, it being explained in two notes, moreover, that “the rejection of autonomy” and the demand that other sections of the Party appeal tothe Jewish proletariat only with the sanction of the BundCentral Committee “ must be put forward as an ultimatum ”. 
 Thus decided the Fifth Congress of the Bund. 
 Charming, is it not? The Bund Congress draws up two sets of Rules simultaneously , defining simultaneously both its maximum and minimum desires or demands. 
 The mini-mum it prudently (oh, so prudently!) tucks away in itspocket. 
 Only the maximum is published (in the leaflet ofAugust 7 [20]), and it is publicly announced, clearly and explicitly, that this maximum draft is “to be submitted to the Second Congress of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party as the basis for the discussion [mark that!] of the Bund’s position in the Party”. 
 The Bund’s opponents,naturally, attack this maximum with the utmost vehemence,just because it is the maximum, the “last word” * of the *By the way, it is extremely characteristic of the Bund’s methods of controversy that this expression called down on our heads the par-ticular wrath of Posledniye Izvestia . 
 33 Why the last word, it demanded, when it (the demand for federation) had been uttered over two years trend they condemn. 
 Thereupon, a month later , these people, without the slightest embarrassment, pull the “minimum” out of their pocket, and add the ominous word: “ ultimatum ”! That is a positive last price , not a “last word”.... 
 Only is it really your last, gentlemen? Perhaps you’ve got a mini-mal minimum in another pocket? Perhaps in another monthor so we shall be seeing that? We very much fear that the Bundists do not quite realise all the “beauty” of this maximum and minimum. 
 Why, how else can you haggle than by asking an exorbitant price, thenknocking off 75 per cent and declaring, “That’s my lastprice”? Why, is there any difference between haggling andpolitics? There is, gentlemen, we make bold to assure you. 
 Firstly, in politics some parties adhere systematically to certain principles , and it is indecent to haggle over principles. 
 Sec-ondly, when people who claim to belong to a party regardcertain of their demands as an ultimatum, that is, as thevery condition of their membership in the party, politicalhonesty requires that they should not conceal the fact, should not tuck it away “ for the time being ” in their pocket, but, on the contrary, should say so openly and definitelyright from the start. 
 We have been preaching these simple truths to the Bund-ists for a long time. 
 As early as February (in our 33rdissue) we wrote that it was stupid and unbefitting to play hide-and-seek, and that the Bund had acted separately (in issuing its statement about the Organising Committee)because it wanted to act as a contracting party and present terms to the Party as a whole. 
 * For this opinion we were drenched with a whole bucketful of specifically Bundist(one might with equal justice say, specifically fish-market) abuse, yet events have now shown that we were right . 
 It is indeed as a contracting party that the Bund comes forward ago? Iskra was counting on the short memory of its readers!... Calm yourselves, calm yourselves, gentlemen! The author of the article called your maximum Rules the last word because that word w a s uttered two days (approximately) before No. 
 46 of Iskra , and not two years ago. 
 *See present edition, Vol. 
 6, pp. 
 319-25. 
— Ed. 
 in the decisions of its Fifth Congress, presenting outright ultimatums to the Party as a whole! That is just what we have been trying all along to get the Bundists to admit, by showing that it followed inevitably from the position theyhad taken up; they angrily protested, dodged and wriggled,but in the end were obliged after all to produce their“minimum”. 
 That is funny; but funnier still is the fact that the Bund continues to wriggle even now, continues to talk about the “falsity” of “ Iskra ’s old, generally known fabrication to the effect that the Bund wants to form a federal alliancewith the Russian Party”. 
 That is a lying fabrication, itclaims, because Paragraph 1 of the Rules proposed by theBund distinctly speaks of its desire to be a component ele-ment of the Party, not to form an alliance with it. 
 Very good, gentlemen! But does not this same paragraph say that the Bund is a federated component of the Party? Don’t your maximum Rules refer throughout to contractingparties? Don’t the minimum Rules speak of an ultimatum , and make any change in their “fundamental clauses” con-tingent on the mutual consent of the component elements of the Party, neither the local nor the district organisa-tions, moreover, being recognised as such for this purpose?You yourselves say that neither local nor district organisa-tions, but only “integral elements of the same nature asthe Bund” can be contracting parties. 
 You yourselves men-tion by way of example that “the Polish, Lithuanian or Lettish Social-Democrats” might be regarded as such inte-gral elements, “ if they belonged to the Party ”, as you sensibly add. 
 But what if they do not belong to the Party? Andwhat if the federation of national organisations which youfind desirable is found undesirable and emphatically rejected by all the rest of the Party? You know very well that that is how matters stand; you yourselves expresslysay you no longer demand that the whole Party be built onthe basis of a federation of nationalities. 
 To whom , then, are you addressing your ultimatum ? Is it not obvious that you are addressing it to the whole Party, minus the Bund? Instead of convicting Iskra of a lying fabrication, you only convict yourselves of a minimum of logic in your subter-fuges. 
 But look, the Bundists protest, in our minimum Rules we have even deleted the federation demand! This deletion of the “dreadful” word is indeed the most interesting epi-sode in the famous transition from maximum to minimum. 
Nowhere else, perhaps, has the Bund’s unconcern for prin-ciples betrayed itself so naïvely. 
 You are dogmatists, hope-less dogmatists, we are told; nothing in the world willinduce you to recognise the federal “principle of organisa-tion”. 
 We, on the other hand, are not dogmatists, we “put the matter on a purely practical footing”. 
 Is it some prin-ciple you don’t like? Queer fellows! Why, then we’ll do with-out any principle at all, we’ll “formulate Paragraph 1in such a way that it shall not be a declaration of a definiteprinciple of organisation”. 
 “The crux of the matter does not lie in the statement of principle prefacing the Rules, but in their concrete clauses, which are derived from an exam-ination of the needs of the Jewish working-class movement,on the one hand, and of the movement as a whole, on theother” (leaflet of September 9 [22], p. 
 1). 
 The naïveté of this argument is so delightful that one just wants to hug the author. 
 The Bundist seriously believes that it is only certain dreadful words the dogmatists fear,and so he decides that if these words are deleted, the dogma-tist will see nothing objectionable in the concrete clausesthemselves! And so he toils in the sweat of his brow, drawsup his maximum Rules; gets in reserve his minimum Rules (against a rainy day), draws up ultimatum No. 
 1, ultima-tum No. 
 2.... 
 Oleum et operam perdidisti , amice !—you are wasting time and effort, my friend. 
 In spite of the cunning(oh, wonderfully cunning!) removal of the label, the dogma-tist detects the federal principle in the minimum’s “concreteclauses” too. 
 That principle is to be seen in the demand that a component element of the Party should not be limited by any territorial bounds, and in the claim to be the “sole ” * *“This word is of no significance,” the Bund now assures us. 
 Strange! Why should a word that has no significance have been insert-ed in both minimum and maximum? In the Russian language the word has a perfectly definite significance. 
 What it signifies in the pre-sent instance is a “declaration” of both federalism and nationalism. 
We would advise the Bundists, who can see no connection betweennationalism and federation, to ponder this point. 
 representative of the Jewish proletariat, and in the demand for “representation” on the Party Central Committee; in the denial to the Party Central Committee of the right to communicate with any part of the Bund without the consentof the Bund Central Committee; in the demand that fun-damental clauses should not be changed without the consentof the component elements of the Party. 
 No, gentlemen, the crux of this matter of the Bund’s position in the Party does lie in the declaration of a definite principle of organisation, and not at all in the concreteclauses. 
 The crux of the matter is a choice of ways. 
 Is the historically evolved isolation of the Bund to be legitimised,or is it to be rejected on principle, and the course openly,definitely, firmly and honestly adopted of ever closer and closer union and fusion with the Party as a whole? Is this isolation to be preserved, or a turn made towards fusion ? That is the question. 
 The answer will depend on the free will of the Bund, for, as we already said in our 33rd issue, “love cannot beforced”. 
 If you want to move towards fusion, you will reject federation and accept autonomy. 
 You will understand in that case that autonomy guarantees a process of fusion sogradual that the reorganisation would proceed with the min-imum of dislocation, and in such a way, moreover, that theJewish working-class movement would lose nothing andgain everything by this reorganisation and fusion. 
 If you do not want to move towards fusion, you will stand for federation (whether in its maximum or minimum form,whether with or without a declaration); you will be afraidof being “steam-rollered”, you will turn the regrettable iso-lation of the Bund into a fetish, and will cry that the abo-lition of this isolation means the destruction of the Bund; you will begin to seek grounds justifying your isolation, and in this search will now grasp at the Zionist idea of a Jewish“nation ”, now resort to demagogy and scurrilities. 
 Federalism can be justified theoretically only on the basis of nationalist ideas, and it would be strange if wehad to prove to the Bundists that it was no mere accident that the declaration of federalism was made at that very Fourth Congress which proclaimed the Jews to be anation. 
 The idea of fusion can be discredited in practice only by inciting politically unenlightened and timid people against the “monstrous”, “Arakcheyev”34 organisational plan of Iskra , which supposedly wants to “regiment” the commit-tees and not allow them to “take a single step without ordersfrom above”. 
 How terrible! We have no doubt that all thecommittees will now hasten to revolt against the iron glove,the Arakcheyev fist, etc.... 
 But where, gentlemen, did you get your information about this brutal organisational plan? From our literature? Then why not quote it? Or from thetales of idle Party gossips, who can tell you on the very bestauthority all, absolutely all the details regarding this Arak-cheyevism? The latter supposition is probably the more cor-rect, for even people with a minimum of logic could hardly confuse the very necessary demand that the Central Commit-tee should “ be able to communicate with every Party mem-ber” * with the patently scurrilous bugbear that the Central Committee will “do everything itself” and “lay down the lawon everything”. 
 Or another thing: what is this nonsense that“between the periphery and the centre” there will be “ lose Organisationen ”? ** We can guess: our worthy Bundists heard something, but did not know what it was all about. 
We shall have to explain it to them at length on some suit-able occasion. 
 But, worst of all, it is not only the local committees that will have to revolt, but the Central Committee too. 
 True, it has not been born yet, 35 but the gossips know for certain not only the birthday of the infant but its wholesubsequent career. 
 It appears it will be a Central Committee“directed by a group of writers ”. 
 Such a tried and cheap meth-od of warfare, this. 
 The Bundists are not the first to employit and most likely will not be the last. 
 To convict this Central Committee, or the Organising Committee, of any mistake, you have to find proof. 
 To convict people of notacting as they themselves think necessary, but of beingdirected by others, you must have the courage to bring charges openly and be ready to answer for them to the whole Party!All that is too dear, too dear in every respect. 
 Gossips’ *See present edition, Vol.

— Ed. 
 **Loose, broad organisations. 
— Ed. 
 tales, on the other hand, are cheap.... 
 And perhaps the fish will bite. 
 It is not pleasant, after all, to be considered a man (or institution) who is “directed”, who is in leading strings, who is a pawn, a creature, a puppet of Iskra .... 
 Our poor, poor future Central Committee! Where will it find aprotector against the Arakcheyev yoke? Perhaps in the“independently acting” Bundists, those strangers to all“suspiciousness”? Iskra , No. 
 49, Published according October 1, 1903 to the Iskra text DRAFT OF A LETTER THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE AND THE EDITORIAL BOARD OF THE CENTRAL ORGAN TO THE MEMBERS OF THE OPPOSITION After a number of unsuccessful attempts to reach an understanding in private conversations, the Central Commit-tee of the Party and the editorial board of the CentralOrgan deem it their duty to address you officially in the name of the Party which they represent. 
 The refusal of Comrade Martov to take his seat on the editorial board or tocollaborate on Iskra , the refusal of the ex-members of the Iskra editorial board to collaborate, and the hostile attitude of several comrades engaged in practical work towards thecentral institutions of our Party are creating an absolutely abnormal attitude on the part of this “opposition”, so called, towards the Party as a whole. 
 Their passive aloofness fromParty work, their attempts to “boycott” the central Party institutions (as expressed, for example, in ceasing to contribute to Iskra beginning from its 46th issue and in the resignation of Comrade Blumenfeld from the printing estab-lishment), their persistence, in conversation with a member of the Central Committee, 36 in calling themselves a “group”, in defiance of the Party Rules, their violent attacks on the Congress-approved personal composition of the central bodies and their demand to have it changed as a conditionfor ending the boycott—all this is conduct which cannot be regarded as consistent with Party duty. 
 Such conduct borders on a direct breach of discipline and nullifies thedecision adopted by the Congress (in the Party Rules) that the allocation of the Party’s forces and resources is the function of the Central Committee. 
 The Central Committee and the editorial board of the Central Organ therefore remind all members of the so-called “opposition” of their Party duty. 
 Dissatisfaction with the personal composition of the central bodies, whether due topersonal resentment or to differences of opinion which par-ticular Party members may consider serious, cannot and must not lead to disloyal actions. 
 If, in the opinion ofany person, the central bodies are committing mistakes, it is his duty as a Party member to point to these mistakes in the full view of the entire Party membership, and, aboveall, to point them out to the central bodies themselves. 
 It is likewise the Party duty of the Central Committee and the editorial board of the Central Organ to examine all suchintimations with the utmost care, no matter from whom received. 
 Yet neither the editorial board of the Central Organ nor the Central Committee has received from the so-calledopposition any clear and definite intimations of mistakes or expressions of dissatisfaction or disagreement on any score whatever. 
 Comrade Martov even refuses to take hisseat on the editorial board of the Central Organ and on the supreme Party Council, though only in that post would he be able to lay bare before the Party all such mistakes ashe may descry in the activities of the central bodies. 
 The Central Committee and the editorial board of the Central Organ are firmly convinced that the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party will not allow the institutions it has set up to be influenced by the illegitimate, covert (in relation to the Party) and disloyal method of pressureand boycott. 
 The Central Committee and the editorial board of the Central Organ declare that they will remain at their posts come what may, until such time as the Party shallremove them, and that they will do their duty and spare no effort to perform the functions with which they have been charged. 
 The attempts at “boycott” will not induce eitherthe editorial board of the Central Organ or the Central Committee to swerve one hair’s breadth from the path they are following, in pursuance of the will of the Congress;such attempts will only cause minor unpleasantnesses and major damage to individual branches of Party work, and will convict those who persist in them of failing to under-stand their Party duty and of violating it.

 Geneva 1 PREFATORY REMARKS TO THE REPORT ON THE SECOND CONGRESS OF THE R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
, OCTOBER 13 (26) I Lenin made a few prefatory remarks to his report. 
 I propose, in the first place, he said, to keep to the pseudo-nyms used at the Congress, because I am accustomed to themand it will be easier for me to use them than to stop andthink each time what organisation the delegate represented. 
Secondly, I propose to touch also on the meetings of the Iskra organisation which took place, privately, so to speak, in the intervals between sittings of the Congress. 
 I thinkthis is in order, firstly, because the League was the for-eign branch of the Iskra organisation, secondly, because the Iskra organisation has now been dissolved, and, thirdly, because without these facts it will be more difficult for me to bring out the true meaning of the events at the Party Congress. 
 II Comrade Martov is against any reference being made to the private meetings of the Iskra organisation on the grounds that no minutes were kept. 
 But neither are the minutes of the Party Congress available yet, and I cannot cite them either. 
 After all, Comrade Martov is present here and willbe able to correct any inaccuracies that may creep in. 
 Ifthe private meetings of Iskra have a bearing on the matter, I shall bring them to the knowledge of an even wider audi-ence—Comrade Martov will not be able to hush them up any-way. 
 (“ Oho !”) I remember perfectly whom I kept out of these meetings, and who withdrew from them, and I shall havea lot to say on this score. 
 Of course, mistakes may occur,and I shall not be able to reconstruct everything frommemory. 
 The important thing is the political grouping. 
 What it was as shown by each particular vote taken, I can, of course, recall only approximately, but in general it is perfectly clear to me. 
 It is not in the interest of the work to conceal from the League what pertains to the Iskra organi-sation, which has now been dissolved, and what has alreadybecome the common concern of the Party. 
 As to thepseudonyms used in the minutes, they would be better, ofcourse, but I have not read the minutes and am therefore unacquainted with them. 
 III Comrade Martov is afraid that discussing the private meetings of Iskra may land us in the domain of tittle-tattle. 
 I had no intention of entering the domain of tittle-tattle,and we shall see who will be able to keep the argumenton the plane of principle, and who will have to descend into that murky domain. 
 (“ Oho !”) We shall see, we shall see! I consider myself fully at liberty to touch on the meetingsof the editorial board, and will not object if Comrade Martovdoes likewise; nevertheless, I must point out that duringthe Congress there was not a single meeting of the editorialboard as such. 
 IV The chief purpose of my report is to show that Comrade Martov made a mistake; but in his hint regarding Comrade Plekhanov I detect something quite different. 
 Let me remindyou of what I said on one occasion at the Party Congress:“What a storm of indignation is usually aroused when peoplesay one thing at committees and another on the floor ofthe Congress. 
 ” * To hint at such behaviour is no longer dis-cussing political conduct but indulging in personalities. 
 As regards P. 
 B. 
 Axelrod’s statement that X. 
 went awaycompletely uninformed, let me say that that was notso at all. 
 He himself wrote me a letter saying that in hisopinion there was a lot that was personal about this wholedivergence and not much that related to principle. 
 From that I conclude that he was already informed. 
 And in answer to his request for my opinion regarding the Congress, I wroteto him on several occasions too.

 2 REPORT ON THE SECOND CONGRESS OF THE R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
, OCTOBER 14 (27) Before beginning his report, Lenin referred to the dis-cussion at the previous sitting as to how far mention mightbe made of the private meetings held by the Iskra -ists during the Party Congress. 
 He interpreted yesterday’s decision of the Congress as meaning that facts not recordedin the minutes must be touched on as little as possible, andtherefore intended, in referring to the meetings of the Iskra organisation, to deal only with the voting results. 
 After this introduction, he went on to speak of the period immediately preceding the Party Congress. 
 In the Organising Committee, whose business it was to arrangethe Congress, the Iskra -ists predominated, and its work was carried on along Iskra -ist lines. 
 But even while the Con-gress arrangements were still in progress it became apparentthat the Organising Committee was far from being com-pletely at one. 
 To begin with, it included a Bundist, who did everything he could to prevent the convocation of anIskra -ist Congress; this member of the Organising Commit-tee always pursued a separate line of his own. 
 There werealso two Yuzhny Rabochy members on it, and although they considered themselves Iskra -ists, and even announced their adherence to Iskra , on which subject there were lengthy negotiations, they could not be wholly regarded as such. 
Lastly, even the Iskra -ist members of the Organising Com-mittee were not completely at one; they had differencesamong themselves. 
 It is also important to mention theOrganising Committee’s decision on the subject of binding instructions. 
 This question came up long before the Congress, and the decision arrived at was that binding instructions be abolished. 
 The editorial board too pronounced emphati-cally in favour of this. 
 The decision applied to itself also. 
 It was decided that at the Congress, since it was the supremeParty authority, no member of the Party, or of the editorialboard, should consider himself bound by any commitmentsto the organisation that had delegated him. 
 It was inview of this decision that I drafted a Tagesordnung * for the Congress, together with a commentary, which I decided to submit to the Congress in my own name. 
 Item 23 of thisdraft had the comment in the margin that three personsshould be elected to the editorial board and as many to theCentral Committee. 
 There is one other point in this connec-tion. 
 As the editorial board consisted of six persons, it was decided by common consent that, if it were found necessary to hold a meeting of the board during the Congress andthe votes divided equally, Comrade Pavlovich would beinvited to the meeting with full voting rights. 
 The delegates began to arrive long before the opening of the Congress. 
 The Organising Committee gave them an opportunity to get acquainted with the editors beforehand. 
 Very naturally, the Iskra -ists wanted to present themselves at the Congress united and in harmony on all points, andwith this in view private conversations were held withthe delegates as they arrived, and meetings were arrangedto work out a common viewpoint. 
 At these meetings the political complexion of some of the delegates became pretty clear. 
 At one such meeting, for instance, where I read a paperon the national question, 38 the delegate from the Mining Area expressed views akin to those of the Polish SocialistParty, 39 and in general betrayed extreme confusion of ideas. 
 Such were the circumstances that preceded the Congress. 
 I shall now explain how I came to be the only delegate from the League, although it had elected two. 
 It turned outthat no delegate had arrived from the Iskra organisation in Russia, 40 which was also to have sent two delegates. 
 Thereupon a meeting of the Iskra -ists, held just before the Congress opened, decided that one of the two League dele-*Agenda. 
— Ed. 
 gates should turn over his mandate to the other and himself act as the delegate of the Iskra organisation with its two mandates, with the provision that if an elected delegate should arrive from Russia, one of these two mandateswould be turned over to him. 
 Naturally, both Martov andI wanted to be the delegate from Iskra , in view of the minor role played by the League. 
 We settled the point by drawinglots. 
 The first preliminary question—the election of the Congress Bureau—gave rise to something of a difference,true, a minor one, between Martov and me. 
 He insisted onthe election of nine persons, these even to include a Bund-ist. 
 I, on the other hand, considered that we should electa Bureau capable of pursuing a firm, consistent policy and, if necessary, even of applying what is called the “iron glove”. 
 The Bureau elected consisted of Plekhanov, Lenin,and Pavlovich. 
 In addition to five Bundists, there were at the Congress two delegates from the Union of Russian Social-DemocratsAbroad and a delegate from the St. 
 Petersburg League of Struggle, who nearly always voted with them. 
 From the very outset these persons greatly dragged out the proceedings. 
The discussion of the Congress Standing Orders alone took upan incredible amount of time. 
 There were endless arguments,lasting several sittings, over the position of the Bund inthe Party. 
 Similar delays were caused by the Bundist who got on to the Credentials Committee. 
 He practised obstruc-tion at every turn, would not agree with the other membersof the committee, of which I was one, on a single point,and invariably recorded a “dissenting opinion”. 
 When itwas remarked that this sort of thing was likely to drag outthe Congress, he replied? “Well, let it”, and said he was ready to have the committee sit for any length of time. 
 It was not till long after midnight that the work of verifying thecredentials was finished. 
 Also in the opening days of the Congress we had an incident over the Organising Committee. 
 Under the Regula-tions it had drawn up, only “prominent Party personalities” could be invited to the Congress in a deliberative capacity, and the Credentials Committee had rejected the request ofthe Borba group to be granted representation. 
 Two members of the Organising Committee had attended the Credentials Committee meeting, and they had categorically opposed admitting a Borba representative to the Congress. 
 When the spokesman for the committee informed the Congress of thisdecision, a long debate “for” and “against” developed, in whichone of the Iskra -ists declared that a representative of Borba should on no account be invited to the Congress, as thatgroup did nothing but intrigue, try to insinuate itself into every chink, sow dissension everywhere, and so on. 
 ( Trotsky : “Why don’t you give the speaker’s name? It was I whosaid it. 
” P. 
 Axelrod : “The speaker evidently does not think it would be in his interest. 
”) Yes, it was Comrade Trotskywho spoke so harshly of the Borba group. 
 At the very heightof this argument about whether a Borba representative should be admitted to the Congress, one of the Yuzhny Rabochy delegates, who had been late in arriving and had only just turned up, asked for a five-minute adjournment toallow him to acquaint himself with all the circumstances ofthe case. 
 When the adjournment was granted, the membersof the Organising Committee held a meeting then and there, by the window. 
 I should mention that even before the Con-gress opened certain Organising Committee members hadshown some dissatisfaction with the editorial board. 
 Forexample, the Bundist member was highly indignant thatthe editorial board had sent its contribution of five hundredmarks to the election fund of the German Social-Democrats in its own name and that of the Organising Committee without first obtaining the latter’s sanction. 
 This innocentaction, which was quite natural considering the impossibilityof communicating promptly with the comrades in Russia,was interpreted by the Bundist as meaning that the editors,living abroad, made free with the name of the Organising Committee without asking its consent. 
 A motion was even tabled in the Organising Committee to censure the editorsfor this, and it was passed, because the Bundist was supportedby Comrade NN, a member of the Iskra organisation. 
 When I told Martov of this, he was much incensed, and saidit was “infamous”. 
 ( Martov : “I did not use the word ‘infa-mous’. 
”) I do not remember the exact expression he used. 
 Martov added that he “would not let the matter rest there”. 
I, for my part, tried to persuade him that the incident was of no great significance, and that it would be better to say nothing and attach no importance to it. 
 When the meeting of the Organising Committee by the window was over, Com-rade Pavlovich, who was a member of it, informed the othertwo members of the Bureau that on the motion of the belatedYuzhny Rabochy delegate, who was also a member of the Organising Committee, the latter had decided by a majorityof all against Pavlovich himself to invite the Borba repre-sentative Ryazanov to the Congress, in a deliberative capacity. 
 Comrade Pavlovich had objected strongly to thisdecision, and, as binding instructions had been abolished,he considered himself at liberty to protest against it to theCongress. 
 We Bureau members, and also the editors and otherIskra -ists, were outraged at this decision of the Organising Committee. 
 Comrade NN, the Organising Committee member I have mentioned, had himself spoken in the CredentialsCommittee against admitting a Borba representative to theCongress, yet now, at this meeting of the OrganisingCommittee, he had agreed to invite one. 
 He was himselftrying now to smuggle Ryazanov into the Congress. 
 We had thus been caught in a trap. 
 And we decided to fight with might and main against this disgraceful Organising Com-mittee decision. 
 Many delegates rose and opposed it. 
 In myown speech on the subject I spoke of “the storm of indigna-tion that is aroused at European congresses when people sayone thing at committees and another on the floor of the congress”. 
 In saying this I had in mind NN, who was a member of the Iskra organisation. 
 When Comrade Pavlovich made his protest to the Congress against this decision of theOrganising Committee, the Yuzhny Rabochy member found this to be a breach of discipline, a disruptive move, and soon, and demanded that the Congress inflict suitable punish-ment on Comrade Pavlovich for his action. 
 But we were able to smash all these arguments. 
 The Organising Committeemajority was defeated. 
 A resolution was passed to the effectthat after the Congress had appointed a Credentials Com-mittee the Organising Committee as a body no longer hadany right to influence the composition of the Congress. 
 The motion to invite Ryazanov was rejected. 
 But even since the Congress I have heard some Iskra -ists question: why not have admitted a Borba member to the Congress? ( Deutsch : “I said that at the Congress itself too. 
”) Quite so, and on other questions also, as I shall have occasion to point out, Comrade Deutsch did not always vote with the rest of the Iskra -ists, as, for instance, on equality of languages. 
 Some Iskra -ists have even been expressing the very singular view that the activities of the Central Committee should reflectall vacillations and primitive conceptions existing in theParty. 
 And at the Congress certain irresolute, wavering Iskra -ists spoke in this same spirit. 
 Thus, the idea that all who claim to be Iskra -ists really are Iskra -ists turns out to be quite mistaken. 
 There are Iskra -ists who are even ashamed of the name—that is a fact. 
 There are Iskra -ists who fight Iskra , who obstruct it in all kinds of ways and hinder its activities. 
 Iskra has become popular, it has become the fashion to call oneself an Iskra -ist, but that does not prevent many people from remaining what they were before Iskra was recognised by many of the committees. 
 These unreliableIskra -ists have done it a great deal of harm. 
 If at least they would fight it openly and squarely.... 
 But no, they do itin a sneaking, underhand, surreptitious, secret manner. 
 The second item on the Tagesordnung of the Party Congress was the Party programme. 
 The supporters of Rabocheye Dyelo , the Bundists, and diverse delegates who during the Congress were nicknamed the “Marsh” practised incredibleobstruction. 
 The debate on the programme dragged outbeyond all belief. 
 Akimov alone moved several dozen amend-ments. 
 There were arguments literally over single words, over what conjunction to use. 
 So many amendments had tobe discussed that one Bundist, a member of the ProgrammeCommittee, asked, and with reason, whose draft we wereconsidering, the one submitted by the editors of Iskra , or one submitted by Akimov. 
 The amendments were trifling, and the programme was adopted without any changes of importance whatever; nevertheless, the debates took upabout twenty sittings, so unproductive was the work of theCongress owing to the opposition of various anti-Iskra -ist and quasi-Iskra -ist elements. 
 The next major incident to arise at the Congress after the Organising Committee incident was in connection with equality of languages, or, as it was ironically called at theCongress, “freedom of tongues”. 
 ( Martov : “Or the ‘asses’. 
” Laughter . 
) Yes, and the “asses”. 
 The point was this. 
 The draft Party programme spoke of equal rights for all citizens irrespective of sex, nationality, religion, etc. 
 This was not enough for the Bundists, and they wanted to write into theprogramme the right of every nationality to receive tuitionin its own language and to use it in addressing public andstate institutions. 
 When a garrulous Bundist referred, byway of example, to state stud farms, Comrade Plekhanov remarked that stud farms had nothing to do with it, as horses do not talk—“only asses do”. 
 The Bundists took offenceat this, evidently thinking the jest was meant for them. 
 It was over the equality of languages question that the first signs of a split appeared. 
 In addition to theBundists, the Rabocheye Dyelo -ists, and the “Marsh”, certain Iskra -ists too pronounced in favour of “freedom of tongues”. 
 Comrade Deutsch’s votes on this issue evoked our astonish-ment, indignation, and disgust; in some cases he abstained,in others voted against us. 
 In the end the question wasdecided amicably and unanimously. 
 On the whole, during the first half of the Congress all the Iskra -ists stood together. 
 The Bundists claimed there was a conspiracy against them. 
 One Bundist described theCongress as a “compact majority”. 
 In reply, I expressedthe wish that our whole Party might become one compactmajority. 
 But the second half of the Congress presented an entirely different picture. 
 From that time began Martov’s historic change of front. 
 The disagreements that developed betweenus were by no means insignificant. 
 They were due to Martov’serroneous appraisal of the present situation. 
 ComradeMartov deviated from the line he had previously adhered to. 
 The fifth item on the Tagesordnung was the Rules. 
 An argument between Martov and myself over Paragraph 1 of them had already arisen in the committee. 
 We each uphelda different formulation. 
 Whereas I proposed defining aParty member as one who accepted the Party programme,supported the Party financially and belonged to one of itsorganisations, Martov thought it sufficient if, in addition to the first two conditions, a person worked under the control of one of the Party organisations. 
 I insisted on my formula-tion and pointed out that we could not adopt a different definition of a Party member without departing from the principle of centralism. 
 To recognise as a Party member one who did not belong to any Party organisation would mean being against all control by the Party. 
 Martov wasintroducing here a new principle that was entirely contraryto the principles of Iskra . 
 His formulation widened the boundaries of the Party. 
 He tried to justify this by sayingthat our Party must be a party of the masses. 
 What he was doing was to open the door to every kind of opportunist, to widen the boundaries of the Party until they became entirelyblurred. 
 In the conditions under which we have to work thisis very dangerous, because it is very difficult to draw theline between a revolutionary and a windbag; that made itnecessary to narrow the concept “Party”. 
 Martov’s mistake was that he was throwing the door of the Party wide open to every adventurer, when it had become apparent that evenat the Congress fully one-third of those present were given tointriguing. 
 Martov on this occasion acted as an opportunist. 
His formulation introduced a false, discordant note into theRules: every Party member should be under the control of an organisation, so that the Central Committee should be able to communicate with every single member. 
 My formulationprovided an incentive to organise. 
 Comrade Martov wascheapening the concept “Party member”, while it should,I consider, stand high, very high. 
 Martov got the support ofRabocheye Dyelo , the Bund and the “Marsh”, and with their aid he secured the adoption of his Paragraph 1 of the Rules. 
 Then Martov began to say that “defamatory rumours” were being circulated about him. 
 But there was nothingoffensive in pointing out with whom Martov found himselfin alliance. 
 I was the object of a similar reproof whenI found myself in alliance with Comrade Brouckère. 
 And I took no offence when Martov sent me a note saying: “Look who is voting with you. 
” True, my alliance with Brouckèrewas a temporary and accidental one, while Martov’s alliancewith the Bund turned out to be lasting. 
 I was against Mar-ov’s formulation because it meant Versumpfung . 
 * I warned Martov of that, and our opponents, by following him to a man, provided eloquent illustration of his error. 
 The most *Sinking into the marsh. 
— Ed. 
 dangerous thing, however, was not that Martov had landed in the marsh, but that, having accidentally done so, he made no attempt to get out of it, but sank in deeper and deeper. 
 The Bundists felt they were now the masters of thesituation, and put their mark on the Party Rules. 
 During the second half of the Congress, too, a compact majority was formed, only it now consisted of a coalitionof the Martovites plus the “Marsh” plus the Rabocheye Dyelo and Bund compact minority. 
 And this compact majority stood against the Iskra -ists. 
 One Bundist, seeing the Iskra -ists quarrelling among themselves, said: “It’s nice to sparwhen the leaders are at loggerheads. 
” I cannot understandwhy the Bund should have withdrawn, things being as theywere. 
 They were actually the masters of the situation, and could have had a lot their own way. 
 Most probably, they had binding instructions. 
 After Paragraph 1 of the Rules had been spoilt in this way, we had to bind the broken pot as tightly as possible,with a double knot. 
 Naturally, we began to fear that wewould be intrigued against, let down. 
 Hence it was nec-essary to introduce mutual co-optation to the central bodies, so that the Party might be assured of their unity of action. 
Over this a struggle developed too. 
 Things had to be so ar-ranged that in the period leading to the Third PartyCongress we should not get a repetition of what had happenedwith the Organising Committee. 
 A consistent, honest Iskra -ist cabinet had to be formed. 
 On this point we were again defeated. 
 The clause on mutual co-optation to the centralbodies was voted down. 
 The mistake of Martov, who wassupported by the “Marsh”, stood out more saliently thanever. 
 From that moment the coalition was definitely formedand, on pain of defeat, we had to load our guns with double charges. 
 There sat the Bund and Rabocheye Dyelo , their votes deciding the fate of the Congress. 
 That caused the stub-born, bitter struggle that ensued. 
 I shall now pass to the private meetings of the Iskra organisation. 
 At these we chiefly discussed the composi-tion of the Central Committee. 
 At all four meetings of the Iskra organisation, there were debates on the subject of Comrade NN, on whom a section of the Iskra -ists wanted to pass a vote of political non-confidence, though not in the literal sense of the term, for no one imputed to NN any-thing that disgraced him, but in the specific sense that he was unfit to be a member of the Iskra -ist cabinet. 
 This led to a desperate scrap. 
 At the last meeting, the meeting of thesixteen, nine voted against NN, four in favour, while therest abstained. 
 At this meeting, too, we discussed who wasnow to be included in our cabinet. 
 Martov and I proposed different “trios”; we could not agree on them. 
 Not wanting to split the vote at the Con-gress, we decided to propose a compromise list. 
 We wereprepared to make every concession: I agreed to a list thatincluded two Martovites. 
 The minority rejected this. 
Incidentally, a Yuzhny Rabochy delegate refused to be included in our list while consenting to be included in the Martovite list. 
 It was Yuzhny Rabochy —an outside element— that was deciding the question of the Central Committee. 
After the Iskra -ists had split, we had to muster our sup-porters, and we started a vigorous agitation. 
 The unexpectedwithdrawal of the Bund reversed the whole situation. 
 Withits withdrawal, there was again a compact majority and minority. 
 We were now in the majority, and we secured the election to the Central Committee of the people we wanted. 
 Such were the circumstances that led to the split. 
 It was exceedingly tactless of Martov to raise at the Congressthe question of endorsing all the six editors of Iskra , when he knew that I would insist on the editors having to be elected. 
 It meant turning the election of the editorial board into an expression of non-confidence in individual editors. 
 The elections ended at five o’clock on Saturday. 
 We then proceeded to discuss the resolutions. 
 We had only afew hours left for this. 
 Owing to the obstruction and delayscaused by the “Marsh”, many important items had to be dropped from the Tagesordnung ; not enough time was left, for instance, to discuss all the tactical questions. 
 Over the resolutions the Congress was so unanimous that we formed the impression that a conciliatory mood haddeveloped; it seemed to us that Martov was not going to makethe disagreements that had arisen an issue of state. 
 He even said, when one of the Yuzhny Rabochy -ists questioned the validity of the elections, that the minority accepted all theCongress decisions. 
 All the resolutions were passed in a peace-ful and amicable spirit; differences arose only over Sta-rover’s resolution on the liberals. 
 It was vague, and it, too, was marked by opportunism; we fought it and secured the adoption of an additional resolution on the same subject. 
 The general impression one got of the Congress was that we had to fight against intrigue. 
 It was made impossiblefor us to work. 
 The natural conclusion was: “Heavenpreserve us from friends like these!”—i. 
e. 
, the quasi-Iskra -ists. 
 Martov completely failed to understand this situation. 
 He elevated his mistaken position to a principle. 
 His asser-tion that the majority had instituted a “state of siege” ranglaringly counter to the Party’s real needs. 
 For the work tobe more effective, it was necessary to eliminate the obstruct-ing elements and make it impossible for them to damage the Party; only if that were done could our work at the next Congress be fruitful. 
 That is why it was necessary to estab-lish complete unity between the central bodies of the Party. 
 The first half of the Congress was the complete opposite of the second. 
 The cardinal, major points of the Congressas a whole were the following four: 1) the Organising Commit-tee incident; 2) the debate on equality of languages; 3) the debate on Paragraph 1 of the Rules, and 4) the struggle overthe elections to the Party central bodies. 
 During the first half of the Congress, Martov stood with us against the Organising Committee, the Bund, Rabocheye Dyelo and the “Marsh”; during the second half he landed accidentally in the marsh. 
 Now, after the Congress, this acci-dental Versumpfung is turning into a real Versumpfung . 
 (Applause . 
) 3 STATEMENT CONCERNING MARTOV’S REPORT OCTOBER 15 (28)41 I protest most emphatically, as against a contemptible method of struggle, against Martov’s asking who was lying or intriguing in reporting the private conversation betweenhim, Starover and myself. 
 I wish to point out that thisconflicts glaringly with Martov’s own statements of yes-terday to the effect that he would disdain to raise theunanswerable question of how truthfully private conver-sations had been reproduced! I declare that Martov’s account of the private conversation en question is altogether incorrect . 
 I declare that I agree to any arbitration and that I challenge Martov to it if he chooses to accuse meof conduct incompatible with holding a responsible postin the Party. 
 I declare that it is the moral duty of Martov, who is not levelling any explicit accusations but only throwing out dark hints—that it is his duty to have thecourage to make his accusations openly and over his signa-ture before the entire Party, and that I, as a member of theeditorial board of the Party’s Central Organ, propose tohim on behalf of the whole editorial board that he immedi-ately publish a pamphlet containing all his accusations. 
 By failing to do this, Martov will only prove that all hewanted was a row at the League Congress, not the moralcleansing of the Party. 
 4 SPEECH ON THE RULES OF THE LEAGUE OCTOBER 17 (30) I shall dwell chiefly on one point, namely, the main speaker’s idea that the League is autonomous in drawing up its Rules. 
 That, in my opinion, is absolutely wrong, forthe Central Committee, in which, under Paragraph 6 of theParty Rules, is vested the right to organise committees,is the only body that can draw up Rules for the League;for organising means first and foremost drawing up Rules. 
 And until the Central Committee endorses the Rules of the League, the League has no Rules. 
 The idea of autonomy is absolutely inapplicable here, for it runs counter to theParty Rules. 
 I once again stress emphatically that, pendingtheir endorsement by the Central Committee, the Leaguehas no Rules. 
 As to the League having been endorsed by the Party Congress, that was not in recognition of its activities, but rather, I should say, in spite of all itsdefects—exclusively because of its consistency of principles. 
 AN UNSUBMITTED STATEMENT42 October 29, 1903 Comrades, I withdrew from the sitting of the Congress yesterday (October 28) because I found it too disgusting to be pres-ent at that raking up of sordid tittle-tattle, rumours andprivate conversations which Martov undertook and performedwith hysterical squealing to the delight of all scandal-lovers. 
 It was as though in self-derision that this same Martov spoke eloquently the day before yesterday about theunseemliness of such references to private conversations,which cannot be verified and which lead one to wonderwhich of the parties to the conversation is lying . 
 It was just such unseemly conduct that Martov indulged in yesterday when he hysterically pressed me to say which of us was lying , he or I, in reporting the famous private conversation onthe subject of the famous trio. 
 This method of provoking a row by asking who is lying is worthy only of a swashbuckler looking for a pretext topick a quarrel, or else of a man wound up to hysterical pitch and incapable of weighing the absurdity of his con-duct. 
 For a political leader accused of definite politicalerrors to use such a method proves unmistakably that he hasno other means of defence and that he is descending fromthe level of political differences to the miserable level ofsquabbling and scandal-mongering. 
 The question now arises, what means of defence can be employed against this swashbuckler’s and rowdy’s trick ofhurling unprovable charges based on private conversations? I say “unprovable” charges, because private conversations of which no record is kept preclude, by their very nature, all possibility of proof, and charges based on them lead merely to reiteration of the word “lie” in all its declen-sions. 
 In the art of such reiteration Martov yesterdayreached a pitch of real virtuosity, and I have no inten-tion of following his example. 
 In my statement yesterday I already indicated one means of defence, and I categorically insist upon it. 
 I chal-lenge my adversary to publish immediately a pamphletsetting forth all his accusations against me, which in hisspeech were levelled in the form of endless and countlessdark hints about lying, intriguing, and so on and so forth. 
I demand that my adversary bring his charges, over his sig-nature, before the whole Party, because he cast a slur on my reputation as a member of the editorial board of theParty Central Organ and said that certain individuals couldnot be allowed to hold responsible posts in the Party. 
I undertake to publish all my adversary’s accusations, for a public airing of the squabbles and scandal will—I know quite positively—be my best defence before the Party. 
 I repeat that if my adversary evades my challenge, it willprove that his accusations are nothing but dark innu-endoes, the product either of the slanderous propensitiesof a scoundrel, or of the hysterical irresponsibility of apolitician who has blundered. 
 However, I have another means of defence, an indirect one. 
 In my statement yesterday, I said that Martov’s accountof the private conversation en question was altogether incorrect. 
 I am not going to go into that again, just be-cause of the hopelessness and uselessness of unprovable assertions. 
 But let everyone ponder over the “document” which I handed to Martov yesterday and which he read to the Congress. 
 That document was the programme for the Con-gress and my commentary to it, a commentary written after the “private” conversation, sent by me to Martov and returned by him with his amendments. 
 This document indisputably represents the quintessence of our conversation, and I have only to analyse its exact text to prove that Martov’s accusations are so much scan-dal. 
 Here is the text in full: /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR “Item 23 [of the Congress Tagesordnung ]. 
 Election of the Central Committee and the editorial board of the Central Organ of the Party . 
” My commentary: “The Congress shall elect three persons to the editorial board of the Central Organ and three t o the Central Committee. 
 These six persons i n c o n j u n c-t i o n shall, if necessary, co-opt by a two-thirds majority vote additional members to the editorial board of the Central Organ and to the Central Committee and report to this effect to the Congress. 
 After the report has been endorsedby the Congress, subsequent co-optation shall be effected bythe editorial board of the Central Organ and by the CentralCommittee separately. 
” Martov has asserted that this system was adopted solely in order to enlarge the editorial board of six. 
 This asser-tion is directly contradicted by the words “if necessary”. 
 Clearly, already at that time the possibility was envisagedthat it might not be necessary. 
 Furthermore, since the con-sent of four out of six was required for co-optation, it isobvious that the editorial board could not be enlarged with-out the consent of non-editors , without the consent of at least one member of the Central Committee. 
 Consequently,the enlargement of the editorial board was made contingenton the consent of a person as to whose identity there couldat that time (a month, if not six weeks, before the Con-gress) be only the vaguest conjectures. 
 Consequently, it is obvious that at that time Martov too considered the editorial board of six, as then constituted, incapable offurther independent existence , since the deciding voice in the matter of enlarging the elected trio was to belong to a non-editor , also to be elected. 
 Martov too considered it impossible to convert the old editorial board of Iskra into the editorial board of the Party Central Organ without outside, non-editorial assistance. 
 To proceed. 
 If it had been a matter solely of enlarging the board of six, what would have been the point of talk-ing about a trio? It would have sufficed to substitute forunanimous co-optation, co-optation by some specified ma-jority. 
 In fact, there would in general have been no point in talking about the editorial board, it would have beenenough to talk about co-optation to Party institutions in general, or to the central Party institutions in particular. 
 Consequently, it is clear that the idea was not simply enlargement. 
 It is equally clear that it was not one member of the old editorial board, but perhaps two , or even three , who stood in the way of possible enlargement, seeing that,in order to enlarge the board of six, it was first considered desirable to reduce it to three. 
 Lastly, compare the procedure for introducing “additional members”, i. 
e. 
, for enlarging the central bodies, as now laid down in the Party Rules adopted by the Congress and asenvisaged in the original plan which Martov and I togetherset down in the above-quoted commentary to Item 23 of theagenda. 
 According to the original plan, the consent of f o u r against two was required (for enlargement of the editorial board of the Central Organ or of the Central Committee), while the present Rules require, in the final analysis, the consentof t h r e e against two ; for the final authority in deciding about co-optation to the central bodies is now the Council,and if two of the editors plus one other member of theCouncil want to enlarge the editorial board, they can, consequently, do it against the wishes of the third. 
 Hence, there cannot be the slightest doubt (from the precise meaning of a precise document) that an alteration inthe composition of the editorial board was contemplated(by Martov and myself, without any protest from any of theother editors) long before the Congress, and that this alter-ation was to be effected irrespective of the wishes or consent of any one member, or possibly even two or three members,of the board of six. 
 One may therefore judge how muchvalidity now attaches to the wretched talk about unofficialbinding instructions having tied the six, about moral bondsbetween them, about the importance of keeping the team intact, and the other such subterfuges in which Martov’s speech abounded. 
 All these subterfuges run directly counterto the explicit text of the commentary, which calls fora reconstitution of the editorial board, a reconstitution to be effected by a rather intricate and, consequently, carefullyconsidered procedure. 
 Still more unquestionably does it follow from this com-mentary that alteration of the composition of the editorialboard was made contingent on the consent of at least two comrades from Russia, elected by the Congress to member-ship of the Central Committee. 
 It is therefore indubitable that both I and Martov hoped to persuade these future mem-bers of the Central Committee that a definite alteration inthe composition of the editorial board was necessary. 
 Thus,we were leaving the composition of the editorial board to bedecided by members of the Central Committee, withoutyet knowing exactly who they would be. 
 Consequently, we entered the struggle h o p i n g t o w i n t h e s e C e n -t r a l C o m m i t t e e m e m b e r s t o o u r s i d e ; and now that the majority of the influential comrades fromRussia have sided at the Congress with me, and not withMartov (in regard to the differences that have arisen be-tween us), for him to wail hysterically over his defeat and indulge in scurrilities and allegations which by their very nature do not admit of proof is a positively indecent andcontemptible method of struggle.

S. 
 At all events, I by no means refuse to support the new central Party institutions by my work, to the best of my ability. 
 Handed to Plekhanov November 1, 1903 Published in 1904 Published according to the manuscript THE POSITION OF THE BUND IN THE PARTY Under this title the Bund has published a translation of an article from No. 
 34 of the Arbeiterstimme . 
44 This article, accompanying the decisions of the Fifth Bund Congress, represents as it were an official commentary onthose decisions. 
 It attempts to give a systematic exposi-tion of all the arguments which lead to the conclusion thatthe Bund “must be a federated component of the Party”. 
It will be interesting to examine these arguments. 
 The author begins by stating that the most burning question facing the Russian Social-Democratic movement isthe question of unity. 
 On what basis can it be effected?The Manifesto of 1898 45 took the principle of autonomy as the basis. 
 The author examines this principle and finds itto be logically false and inherently contradictory. 
 If by questions which specifically concern the Jewish proletariat are meant only such as relate to methods of agitation (withreference to the specific language, mentality and cultureof the Jews), that will be technical (?) autonomy. 
 But suchautonomy will mean the destruction of all independence,for it is an autonomy enjoyed by every Party committee, and to put the Bund on a par with the committees will be a denial of autonomy. 
 If, on the other hand, autonomy isunderstood to mean autonomy in some questions of theprogramme, it is unreasonable to deprive the Bund of allindependence in the other questions of the programme; andindependence in questions of programme necessarily involves representation of the Bund, as such, on the central bodies of the Party—that is, not autonomy, but federation. 
A sound basis for the position of the Bund in the Party must be sought in the history of the Jewish revolutionary move-ment in Russia, and what that history shows is that all organisations active among the Jewish workers joined to form a single union—the Bund—and that its activitiesspread from Lithuania to Poland and then to the South ofRussia. 
 Consequently, history broke down all regionalbarriers and brought forward the Bund as the sole representa-tive of the Jewish proletariat. 
 And there you have a principle which is not the fruit of an idle brain (?) but follows from the whole history of the Jewish working-class movement:the Bund is the sole representative of the interests of theJewish proletariat. 
 And, naturally, the organisation of theproletariat of a whole nationality can enter the Party onlyif the latter has a federal structure: the Jewish proletariat is not only part of the world family of proletarians, but also part of the Jewish nation, which occupies a special positionamong the nations. 
 Lastly, it is federation that denotes closeunity between the component elements of the Party, for itschief feature is direct participation by each of them in Partyaffairs, and they all feel they have equal rights. 
 Under auton-omy, on the other hand, the components of the Party have no rights, and there is indifference to its common affairs, andmutual distrust, friction and conflict. 
 Such is the author’s line of argument, which we have presented almost entirely in his own words. 
 It boils downto three things: considerations of a general nature as to the inherent contradictoriness of autonomy and its unsuit-ability from the standpoint of close unity between thecomponents of the Party; lessons from history, which hasmade the Bund the sole representative of the Jewish prole-tariat; and, lastly, the affirmation that the Jewish proletari-at is the proletariat of a whole nationality, a nationality occupying a special position. 
 Thus the author endeavours to build his case on general principles of organisation, onthe lessons of history, and on the idea of nationality. 
 Hetries—we must give him his due—to examine the matterfrom all angles. 
 And for that very reason his statement ofthe case brings out so saliently the attitude of the Bund on this question which is of deep concern to all of us. 
 Under federation, we are told, the components of the Party have equal rights and share directly in its common affairs; under autonomy they have no rights, and as such do not share in the general life of the Party. 
 This argu-ment belongs entirely to the realm of obvious fallacies; it is as like as two peas to those arguments which mathe-maticians call mathematical sophistries, and which prove—quite logically, at first glance—that twice two are five,that the part is greater than the whole, and so on. 
 Thereare collections of such mathematical sophistries, and they are of some value to school children. 
 But it is even embarrass-ing to have to explain to people who claim to be the solerepresentatives of the Jewish proletariat so elementarya sophistry as the attribution of different meanings to theterm “component of the Party” in two parts of one and thesame argument. 
 When they speak of federation, they mean by a component of the Party a sum-total of organisations in different localities; but when they speak of autonomy,they mean by it each local organisation separately. 
 Putthese supposedly identical concepts side by side in thesame syllogism, and you will arrive inevitably at the con-clusion that twice two are five. 
 And if the Bundists are still unclear as to the nature of their sophistry, let them consult their own maximum Rules and they will see that itis under federation that the local organisations communi-cate with the Party centre indirectly, and under autonomy— directly. 
 No, our federalists would do better not to talkabout “close unity”! By trying to disprove that federation means the isolation , and autonomy the fusion of the different components of the Party, they only provoke hilarity. 
 Hardly more successful is the attempt to prove the “logical falsity” of autonomy by dividing the latter into programmeautonomy and technical autonomy. 
 The division itself isutterly absurd. 
 Why should the specific methods of agitation among Jewish workers be classed under technical questions? What has technique to do with it, when it is a matter ofpeculiarities of language, mentality, conditions of life?How can you talk of independence in questions of programmein connection, for example, with the demand for civilequality for the Jews? The Social-Democratic programme only sets forth the basic demands, common to the entire proletariat, irrespective of occupational, local, national,or racial distinctions. 
 The effect of these distinctions is that one and the same demand for complete equality of citizens before the law gives rise to agitation against one form of inequality in one locality and against another form of in-equality in another locality or in relation to other groups ofthe proletariat, and so on. 
 One and the same point in theprogramme will be applied differently depending on differ-ences in conditions of life, differences of culture, differencesin the relation of social forces in different parts of the coun-try, and so forth. 
 Agitation on behalf of one and the same demand in the programme will be carried on in differentways and in different languages taking into account all thesedifferences. 
 Consequently, autonomy in questions specificallyconcerning the proletariat of a given race, nation, or districtimplies that it is left to the discretion of the organisation concerned to determine the specific demands to be advanced in pursuance of the common programme, and the methods ofagitation to be employed. 
 The Party as a whole, its centralinstitutions, lay down the common fundamental principlesof programme and tactics; as to the different methods ofcarrying out these principles in practice and agitating for them, they are laid down by the various Party organisations subordinate to the centre, depending on local, racial, nation-al, cultural, and other differences. 
 Is there anything unclear about this conception of auton-omy? And is it not the sheerest scholasticism to make adivision into programme autonomy and technical autonomy? Just see how the concept autonomy is “logically ana-lysed” in the pamphlet we are examining. 
 “From the totalbody of questions with which the Social-Democrats have todeal,” the pamphlet says in connection with the autonomyprinciple taken as the basis in the 1898 Manifesto, “thereare singled out [ sic!!] some questions, which, it is recog-nised, specifically concern the Jewish proletariat.... 
 Where the realm of general questions begins, the autonomy of theBund ends.... 
 This gives rise to a duality in the positionof the Bund in the Party: in specific questions it acts asthe Bund ... in general questions it loses its distinctivecharacter and is put on a par with an ordinary committee of the Party.... 
” The Social-Democratic programme demands complete equality of all citizens before the law. 
 In pursu-ance of that programme the Jewish worker in Vilna puts forward one specific demand, and the Bashkir worker in Ufa an entirely different specific demand. 
 Does that mean that “from the total body of questions” “some are singled out ”? If the general demand for equality is embodied in a numberof specific demands for the abolition of specific forms ofinequality, is that a singling out of the specific from the general questions? The specific demands are not singled outfrom the general demands of the programme, but are advanced in pursuance of them. 
 What is singled out is what specifi-cally concerns the Jew in Vilna as distinct from what specif-ically concerns the Bashkir in Ufa. 
 The generalisation oftheir demands, the representation of their common class interests (and not of their specific occupational, racial, local, national, or other interests) is the affair of the whole Party, of the Party centre. 
 That would surely seem clear enough! The reason the Bundists have muddled it is that, insteadof logical analysis, they have again and again given us speci-mens of logical fallacies. 
 They have entirely failed to graspthe relation between the Social-Democrats’ general andspecific demands. 
 They imagine that “from the total body of questions with which the Social-Democrats have to deal, some questions are singled out”, when actually every question dealt with in our programme is a generalisation of a numberof specific questions and demands; every point in the pro-gramme is common to the entire proletariat, while at the same time it is subdivided into specific questions depending on the proletarians’ different occupations, their different conditions of life, differences of language, and so on and soforth. 
 The Bundists are disturbed by the contradictorinessand duality of the position of the Bund, consisting, don’tyou see, in the fact that in specific questions it acts as theBund, while in general questions it loses its distinctive character. 
 A little reflection would show them that such a “duality” exists in the position of absolutely every Social-Democratic worker, who in specific questions acts as a workerin a particular trade, a member of a particular nation, aninhabitant of a particular locality, while in general questionshe “loses his distinctive character” and is put on a par with every other Social-Democrat. 
 The autonomy of the Bund, under the Rules of 1898, is of exactly the same nature as theautonomy of the Tula Committee; only the limits of this auton-omy are somewhat different and somewhat wider in the former case than in the latter. 
 And there is nothing but a crying logical fallacy in the following argument, by which the Bund tries to refute this conclusion: “If the Bund isallowed independence in some questions of the programme , on what grounds is it deprived of all independence in the other questions of the programme?” This contrasting ofspecific and general questions as “some” and “ the others ” is an inimitable specimen of Bundist “logical analysis”! These people simply cannot understand that it is likecontrasting the different colours, tastes, and fragrances ofparticular apples to the number of “other” apples. 
 We make bold to inform you, gentlemen, that not only some, butevery apple has its special taste, colour, and fragrance. 
 Not only in “some” questions of the programme, but in all with-out exception , you are allowed independence, gentlemen, but only as far as concerns their application to the specificfeatures of the Jewish proletariat. 
 “ Mein teuerer Freund , ich rat’ Euch drum zuerst Collegium logicum! ” * The second argument of the Bundists is an appeal to history, which is supposed to have brought forward the Bund as the sole representative of the Jewish proletariat. 
 In the first place, this is not true. 
 The author of the pam-phlet himself says that “the work of other organisations[besides the Bund] in this direction [i. 
e. 
, among the Jewishproletariat] either yielded no results at all, or results too insignificant to merit attention”. 
 Hence, on his own admis-sion, there was such work, and consequently the Bund was not the sole representative of the Jewish proletariat; as regards the results of this work, no one, of course, willrely on the Bund’s opinion; and, lastly, it is a known factthat the Bund interfered with the work of other organisa-tions among the Jewish proletariat (we have only to mention the well-known incident of its campaign against the Ekate-rinoslav Party Committee for daring to issue a proclama-tion to the Jewish workers 47), so that even if the results did indeed merit no attention, the Bund itself would bepartly to blame. 
 *“Hence, my dear friend, I would advise you to begin with college logic. 
”46—Ed. 
 Further, the measure of truth contained in the Bund’s historical reference does not in the least prove the sound-ness of its arguments. 
 The facts which did take place and which the Bund has in mind speak against it, not for it. 
These facts are that the Bund existed and developed—duringthe five years since the First Congress—quite separatelyand independently from the other organisations of theParty. 
 In general, the actual ties between all Party organi-sations during this period were very weak, but the ties be-tween the Bund and the rest of the Party were not only farweaker than those between the other organisations, but theykept growing weaker all the time. 
 That the Bund itselfweakened these ties is directly proved by the history of our Party’s organisations abroad. 
 In 1898, the Bund members abroad belonged to the one common Party organisation; but by 1903 they had left it to form a completely separate andindependent organisation. 
 The separateness and indepen-dence of the Bund is beyond question, as is also the factthat it has steadily become more pronounced. 
 What follows from this unquestionable fact? What fol-lows in the opinion of the Bundists is that one must bow to this fact, slavishly submit to it, turn it into a principle,into the sole principle providing a sound basis for the posi-tion of the Bund, and legitimise this principle in the Rules,which should recognise the Bund as the sole representativeof the Jewish proletariat in the Party. 
 In our opinion, on the other hand, such a conclusion is the sheerest opportun-ism, “tail-ism” 48 of the worst kind. 
 The conclusion to be drawn from the five years of disunity is not that this disunityshould be legitimised, but that an end should be put to itonce and for all. 
 And will anybody still venture to denythat it really was disunity? All component parts of the Party developed separately and independently during this period— are we perhaps to deduce from this the “principle” of federa-tion between Siberia, the Caucasus, the Urals, the South,and the rest?? The Bundists themselves say that, as regardsorganisational unity of its components, the Party virtuallydid not exist—and how can what evolved when the Party did not exist be taken as a pattern for the restoration o f organisational unity? No, gentlemen, your reference to thehistory of the disunity that gave rise to isolation proves nothing whatever except that this isolation is abnormal. 
 To deduce a “principle” of organisation from several years of disorganisation in the Party is to act like those representa-tives of the historical school who, as Marx sarcasticallyobserved, were prepared to defend the knout on the groundsthat it was historical. 
 Hence, neither the “logical analysis” of autonomy nor the appeals to history can provide even the shadow of a “principle” justifying the isolation of the Bund. 
 But the Bund’s third argument, which invokes the idea of a Jewishnation, is undoubtedly of the nature of a principle. 
 Unfortu-nately, however, this Zionist idea is absolutely false andessentially reactionary. 
 “The Jews have ceased to be a nation,for a nation without a territory is unthinkable,” says one of the most prominent of Marxist theoreticians, Karl Kauts-ky (see No. 
 42 of Iskra and the separate reprint from it The Kishinev Massacre and the Jewish Question , p. 
 3). 
 And quite recently, examining the problem of nationalities inAustria, the same writer endeavoured to give a scientificdefinition of the concept nationality and established two principal criteria of a nationality: language and territory (Neue Zeit , 49 1903, No. 
 2). 
 A French Jew, the radical Alfred Naquet, says practically the same thing, word for word,in his controversy with the anti-Semites and the Zionists. 
 50 “If it pleased Bernard Lazare,” he writes of the well-knownZionist, “to consider himself a citizen of a separate nation, that is his affair; but I declare that, although I was born a Jew ... I do not recognise Jewish nationality.... 
 I belong tono other nation but the French.... 
 Are the Jews a nation?Although they were one in the remote past, my reply is a cat-egorical negative . 
 The concept nation implies certain condi-tions which do not exist in this case. 
 A nation must have a territory on which to develop, and, in our time at least, until a world confederation has extended this basis, a nationmust have a common language . 
 And the Jews no longerhave either a territory or a common language.... 
 Like myself,Bernard Lazare probably did not know a word of Hebrew,and would have found it no easy matter, if Zionism had achieved its purpose, to make himself understood to his co-racials [ congénères ] from other parts of the world” ( La Petite République , September 24, 1903). 
 “German and French Jews are quite unlike Polish and Russian Jews. 
 The character-istic features of the Jews include nothing that bears the imprint [ empreinte ] of nationality. 
 If it were permissible to recognise the Jews as a nation, as Drumont does, it wouldbe an artificial nation. 
 The modern Jew is a product of theunnatural selection to which his forebears were subjectedfor nearly eighteen centuries. 
” All that remains for theBundists is to develop the theory of a separate Russian-Jewish nation, whose language is Yiddish and their territory the Pale of Settlement. 
 51 Absolutely untenable scientifically, * the idea that the Jews form a separate nation is reactionary politically. 
Irrefutable practical proof of that is furnished by generallyknown facts of recent history and of present-day political realities. 
 All over Europe, the decline of medievalism and the development of political liberty went hand in handwith the political emancipation of the Jews, their abandon-ment of Yiddish for the language of the people among whomthey lived, and, in general, their undeniable progressiveassimilation with the surrounding population. 
 Are we again to revert to the exceptionalist theories and proclaim that Russia will be the one exception, although the Jewish eman-cipation movement is far broader and deeper-rooted here,thanks to the awakening of a heroic class-consciousnessamong the Jewish proletariat? Can we possibly attributeto chance the fact that it is the reactionary forces all over Europe, and especially in Russia, who oppose the assimilation of the Jews and try to perpetuate their isolation? That is precisely what the Jewish problem amounts to : assimilation or isolation?— and the idea of a Jewish “na-*Not only national, but even racial peculiarities are denied to the Jew by modern scientific investigators, who give prime prominence to the peculiarities of the history of the Jews. 
 “Do the peculiarities of Jewry spring from its racial character?” Karl Kautsky asks, andreplies that we do not even know with precision what race means. 
 “There is no need to bring in the concept race, which provides no real answer but only poses new problems. 
 It is enough to trace thehistory of the Jews to ascertain the reasons, for their characteristics. 
” And such an expert in this history as Renan says: “The characteris-tic features of the Jews and their manner of life are far more a pro-duct of the social conditions, [ nécessités sociales ] by which they have been influenced for centuries than a racial distinction [ phénomène de race ]. 
 52 tionality” is definitely reactionary not only when expounded by its consistent advocates (the Zionists), but likewise on the lips of those who try to combine it with the ideas of Social-Democracy (the Bundists). 
 The idea of a Jewishnationality runs counter to the interests of the Jewishproletariat, for it fosters among them, directly or indirectly,a spirit hostile to assimilation, the spirit of the “ghetto”. 
“When the National Assembly of 1791 decreed the eman-cipation of the Jews,” writes Renan, “it was very little concerned with the question of race.... 
 It is the business ofthe nineteenth century to abolish all ‘ghettos’, and I cannotcompliment those who seek to restore them. 
 The Jewishrace has rendered the world the greatest services. 
 Assim-ilated with the various nations, harmoniously blended with the various national units, it will render no lesser services in the future than in the past. 
” And Karl Kautsky,in particular reference to the Russian Jews, expresses him-self even more vigorously. 
 Hostility towards non-nativesections of the population can only be eliminated “when thenon-native sections of the population cease to be alien and blend with the general mass of the population. 
 That is the only possible solution of the Jewish problem , and we should support everything that makes for the ending of Jewish isola-tion . 
” Yet the Bund is resisting this only possible solution, for it is helping, not to end but to increase and legitimiseJewish isolation, by propagating the idea of a Jewish “na-tion” and a plan of federating Jewish and non-Jewish prole-tarians. 
 That is the basic mistake of “Bundism”, which con-sistent Jewish Social-Democrats must and will correct. 
This mistake drives the Bundists to actions unheard-of in the international Social-Democratic movement, such as stirringup distrust among Jewish towards non-Jewish proletarians, fostering suspicion of the latter and disseminating falsehoods about them. 
 Here is proof, taken from this same pamphlet: “Such an absurdity [as that the organisation of the proletar-iat of a whole nationality should be denied representation on the central Party bodies] could be openly advocated only [mark that!] in regard to the Jewish proletariat, which, owing to the peculiar historical fortunes of the Jewish people, still has to fight for equality [!!] in the world family of the prole-tariat. 
” We recently came across just such a trick in a Zionist leaflet, whose authors raved and fumed against Iskra , pur-porting to detect in its struggle with the Bund a refusal to recognise the “equality” of Jew and non-Jew. 
 And now we find the Bundists repeating the tricks of the Zionists! Thisis disseminating an outright falsehood, for we have “advo-cated” “denying representation” not “only” to the Jews, butalso to the Armenians, the Georgians and so on, and in thecase of the Poles, too, we called for the closest union and fusion of the entire proletariat fighting against the tsarist autocracy. 
 It was not for nothing that the P. 
S. 
P. 
 (PolishSocialist Party) raged and fulminated against us! To calla fight for the Zionist idea of a Jewish nation, for the federal principle of Party organisation, a “fight for the equality of the Jews in the world family of the proletariat ” is to degrade the struggle from the plane of ideas and principles to that of suspicion, incitement and fanning of historically-evolvedprejudices. 
 It glaringly reveals a lack of real ideas andprinciples as weapons of struggle. 
 * * * We thus arrive at the conclusion that neither the logical, nor the historical, nor yet the nationalist arguments of theBund will stand criticism. 
 The period of disunity, whichaggravated waverings among the Russian Social-Democratsand the isolation of the various organisations, had the same effect, to an even more marked degree, in the case of the Bundists. 
 Instead of proclaiming war on this historicallyevolved isolation (further increased by the general disunity),they elevated it to a principle, seizing for this purpose onthe sophistry that autonomy is inherently contradictory,and on the Zionist idea of a Jewish nation. 
 Only if it frankly and resolutely admits its mistake and sets out to move towards fusion can the Bund turn away from the false path it has taken. 
 And we are convinced that the finest adherents ofSocial-Democratic ideas among the Jewish proletariat willsooner or later compel the Bund to turn from the path ofisolation to that of fusion. 
 Iskra , No. 
 51, October 22, 1903 Published according to the Iskra text THE NARODNIK-LIKE BOURGEOISIE AND DISTRAUGHT NARODISM Russian Marxists have long been pointing to the degenerati-on of the old, classical, revolutionary Russian Narodism that has been going on steadily since the eighties. 
 Faith declinedin a special system of peasant economy, in the village com-mune as the germ and basis of socialism, in the possibilityof avoiding the path of capitalism by an immediate socialrevolution, for which the people were supposed to be already prepared. 
 The demands for all kinds of measures to bolster up peasant economy and “small people’s production” ingeneral were the only ones to retain any political signifi-cance. 
 Essentially, this was already nothing but bourgeoisreformism; Narodism melted into liberalism; a liberal-Narodnik trend arose that would not or could not see that the measures envisaged (credits, co-operative societies, land improvement, enlargement of land holdings, and all therest) did not go beyond the framework of existing bourgeois society. 
 The Narodnik theories of Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
, Mr. 
 Nikolai—on 53 and their numerous echoers only served as a quasi-scientific cloak for this unpleasant but indubitable fact. 
 Marxist criticism tore off this cloak, and the influence of Narodnik ideas on Russian revolutionary circles began to ebbwith amazing rapidity. 
 These ideas were already becomingin fact the exclusive possession of the stratum to which theywere kin in spirit—Russian liberal “society”. 
 West-European Bernsteinism was a new current that strengthened and at the same time modified the above-mentioned trend. 
 There is truth, it seems, in the saying that“a prophet is not without honour, save in his own country”. 
 Bernstein had no luck in his own country, but, on the other hand, his ideas were “taken seriously” and applied in practice by certain socialists in France, Italy and Russia, who rapid-ly evolved into exponents of bourgeois reformism. 
 Fructi-fied by these ideas, our liberal-Narodnik trend acquired newfollowers of the ex-Marxist variety and at the same timematured inwardly, discarding certain primitive illusionsand reactionary accretions. 
 Bernsteinism served its pur-pose—not by transforming socialism, but by giving artic-ulation to the new phase of bourgeois liberalism and re-moving the socialist mask from certain quasi-social-ists. 
 A highly interesting and instructive example of the mingling and fusion of European opportunist and Russian Narodnik ideas is to be found in Mr. 
 L. 
’s article “The Agrar-ian Question” in No. 
 9 (33) of Osvobozhdeniye . 
 This is a truly programmatic article; it diligently sets forth the generalcredo of the author and systematically applies it to a definite sphere of problems. 
 This article will become a landmark inthe history of Russian liberalism, denoting a big step forward in its shaping and consolidation. 
 The author dresses his bourgeois liberalism in a coat cut according to the latest fashion. 
 Repeating Bernstein almostword for word, he tries with an amusing earnestness to per-suade the reader that “liberalism and socialism can by nomeans be separated from each other, let alone contrasted to each other: they are identical and inseparable in their fundamental ideal. 
 Socialism offers no menace to liberalism,as many fear; it comes not to destroy, but to fulfil the com-mandments of liberalism. 
” The wish, as we know, is fatherto the thought; and Mr. 
 L. 
 and his like would very muchwish the Social-Democrats not to separate themselves from the liberals, and to have them understand socialism “not as ready-made dogmas and petrified doctrines claiming to takeaccount in advance of the whole course of historical devel-opment” (and so on, quite in the spirit of Revolutsionnaya Rossiya ), but “as a general ethical ideal” (which, as we know, all philistines, the liberals included, regard as unrealisable in this earthly vale and as belonging to the realm of the hereafter and of “things-in-themselves”). 
 The liberals, naturally, want—excuse the vulgarism!— to show off their wares to the best advantage, to identify political liberalism in Russia with social-economic democra-cy. 
 It is a very “well-meaning” idea, but at the same timevery muddled and very artful. 
 Well-meaning because itexpresses the kind intention of a certain section of the lib-erals to work for broad social reforms. 
 Muddled, becauseit is based on contrasting democratic to bourgeois liberalism (again quite in the spirit of Revolutsionnaya Rossiya !); the author apparently has no inkling of the fact that inany capitalist society there are bound to be some bour-geois -democratic elements who stand for broad democratic and social-economic reforms; like all the Russian Mille-rands, 54 he would like to identify bourgeois reformism with socialism, understood, of course, “not as ready-made dog-mas”, etc. 
 Lastly, it is a very artful idea because the authorassures himself and others that the sympathy with reform—“concern for the needs and interests of the people, ‘Narodism’in the true and fine ethical sense of the term”—which isentertained by a certain section of the liberals a certain historical moment is, or could be, a permanent attribute of liberalism as such. 
 That is so naïve as almost to be touching. 
Who does not know that every bourgeois ex-government,every “His Majesty’s Opposition” always clamours aboutits true, fine and ethical “Narodism”—as long as it remainsin opposition? The Russian bourgeoisie plays at Narodism (and sometimes sincerely) just because it is in opposition, and not yet at the helm of state. 
 The Russian proletariat’sreply to the artful blandishments of the Osvobozhdeniye gentry will be: “ Pas si bête , messieurs! We are not such fools, gentlemen, as to believe that. 
” From these general arguments as to the identity of liber-alism and socialism, Mr. 
 L. 
 passes to the general theory of the agrarian question. 
 In a matter of a dozen lines he demol-ishes Marxism (once again in the spirit of Revolutsionnaya Rossiya ), presenting it for this purpose, as is customary, in a vulgarly simplified form and proclaiming it to be contraryto experience, scientifically unproved, and generally false! It is highly characteristic that the only confirmation he adduces is a reference to European socialist (his own italics) literature—Bernsteinian, evidently. 
 A very convincing reference. 
 If European ( European !) socialists are beginning to think and argue like bourgeois, why should not Russian bourgeois proclaim themselves both Narodniks and social-ists? If the Marxist view of the peasant question “wereincontestable and the only possible one, it would,” Mr. 
 L. 
assures us, “place all of Zemstvo [ sic!] Russia in a terrible, a tragic position and doom it to inaction, in view of thedemonstrated impossibility of a progressive agrarian policy and of rational and effective aid to peasant economy in general. 
” The argument, as you see, is unanswerable: because Marxism demonstrates the impossibility under capitalismof any degree of lasting prosperity for at all broad sectionsof the peasantry, it therefore places “Zemstvo” (a slip of the pen for “landowning”?) Russia—the Russia, that is, that lives by ruining and proletarising the peasantry—in a terri-ble, a tragic position. 
 Why, yes, that is one of the historicservices of Marxism: it has once and for all placed in a terri-ble, a tragicomic position—the ideologists of the bourgeoisiewho deck themselves in the toga of Narodism, social-eco-nomic democracy, etc. 
 To finish with Mr. 
 L. 
’s theoretical exercises we have now only to quote the following gem. 
 “Here” (in agriculture),we are told, “there is not and cannot be that automatic [!]progress which is to a certain extent possible in industry,depending on the objective [!] development of technology. 
”This inimitable profundity has been borrowed in its entirety from Messieurs the Kablukovs, Bulgakovs, E. 
 Davids and tutti quanti , who in their “learned” works justify the back-wardness of their own ideas by the technical, economicand social backwardness of agriculture. 
 The backwardnessof agriculture is indubitable, it has long been recognisedby Marxists and is fully explainable; but as for this “auto-matic [if only to a certain extent] progress in industry”, and the objective development of technology—it is just sheergibberish. 
 However, excursions into the realm of science are no more than an architectural ornament to Mr. 
 L. 
’s article. 
 Truepractical politician that he is, he offers us, along with sheer muddle-headedness in general reasoning, an extremely sober and business-like practical programme. 
 True, he makes themodest reservation—in his stilted official Russian—that he disclaims all intention of adumbrating a programme and confines himself to intimating his attitude—but that is just his modesty. 
 Actually, we have in Mr. 
 L. 
’s article a very complete and detailed agrarian programme for theRussian liberals, which only lacks stylistic editing and para-graphing by clauses. 
 It is a programme in a consistent liberalspirit: political liberty, democratic tax reform, freedom ofmovement, a peasant democratic agrarian policy aiming at the democratisation of landownership. 
 With a view to this democratisation, it demands freedom to leave the villagecommune, the conversion of the latter from a compulsoryinto a voluntary association similar to any economic asso-ciation, and democratic rent laws. 
 The “state” should facili-tate “the transfer of land to the labouring masses” by means of a number of measures, namely: extension of the activities of the Peasant Bank, conversion of the royal demesne intostate demesne, “the creation of small farms, individual orco-operative, not using hired labour”, and, lastly, compulso-ry alienation or redemption of lands essential to the peasants. 
“Of course, this compulsory redemption must be placed on a firm basis of law and attended in each particular case by reliable guarantees”, but in some cases it must be effected“almost [ sic!] unconditionally”—for example, in relation to the “cut-off lands”, 55 which create something in the nature of feudal relations. 
 In order to abolish semi-feudal relations,the state should be given the right of compulsory aliena-tion and compulsory demarcation of the plots in ques-tion. 
 Such is the agrarian programme of the liberals. 
 A parallel between it and the Social-Democratic agrarian programmenaturally suggests itself. 
 Where they resemble each otheris in the identity of the immediate tendency and the similar-ity of most of the demands. 
 Where they differ is in the two following cardinally important points. 
 Firstly, the Social-Democrats want to effect the abolition of the remnants offeudalism (which both programmes directly advance as theaim) by revolutionary means and with revolutionary deter-mination, the liberals—by reformist means and half-heart-edly. 
 Secondly, the Social-Democrats’ stress that the system to be purged of the remnants of feudalism is a bourgeoissystem; they already now, in advance, expose all its contra-dictions, and strive immediately to extend and render more conscious the class struggle that is inherent in this new sys-tem and is already coming to the surface. 
 The liberals ignore the bourgeois character of the system purged of feudalism,gloss over its contradictions and try to damp down the classstruggle inherent in it. 
 Let us consider these differences. 
The reformist and half-hearted character of the liberal agrarian programme is clearly apparent first of all from the fact that it does not go beyond “compulsory redemp-tion”, and only “almost” unconditional at that, whereas theSocial-Democratic agrarian programme demands the aliena-tion of the cut-off lands from their old owners withoutcompensation, and countenances compensation only in spe-cial cases, and then at the expense of the land of the nobility. 
 Nor, as is well known, * do the Social-Democrats reject expropriation of the landed estates in their entirety, but onlyregard it as impermissible and irresponsible to include thisdemand, which is not appropriate under all circumstances,in the programme. 
 The Social-Democrats from the very start call on the proletariat to take the first revolutionary step in conjunction with the well-to-do peasants in order thenat once to go farther, either in conjunction with the peasantbourgeoisie against the landlord class, or against the peasantbourgeoisie and the landlord class if they have joined forces. 
The liberals even at this stage, in the struggle against semi-feudal relations, shrink from class action and struggle. 
 They want to entrust the reform to the “state” (forgetting the classcharacter of the state) with the help of local self-governmentbodies and “ ad hoc ” commissions, drawing a parallel—noth-ing could be more characteristic—between the compulsoryalienation of the cut-off lands and the compulsory alienation of land for building railways!! Our liberals could not have more clearly expressed, or rather betrayed , their cherished wish of surrounding the new reform with the same “conve-niences” for the ruling classes as always and everywhere attendthe sale of land to the railways. 
 And this in the same breathwith the fine phrases about substituting a peasant democratic *See Plekhanov’s statement in No. 
 4 of Zarya and mine in the reply to X. 
 (See present edition, Vol. 
 6, pp. 
 446-47. 
— Ed. 
) agrarian policy for the agrarian policy of an aristocratic caste! In order to effect that substitution in practice, you have to appeal, not to the “public interest”, but to the oppressed class—the peasantry—against the oppressingclass—the nobility; you have to rouse the former against the latter, have to call for revolutionary action by the peas-antry, not for reformist activity by the state. 
 Further,when they talk about abolishing semi-feudal relations, the liberals refuse to see the precise nature of the relations that they propose to purge of feudalism. 
 Mr. 
 L. 
, for example,repeats the catchphrases of Mr. 
 Nikolai—on, Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
and the rest about “the principle of recognising the tiller’sright to the land he cultivates” and about the “virility” ofthe peasantry, but is modestly silent about the “principle” of bourgeois farming and the exploitation of wage-labour by these virile peasants. 
 That it is the position of the petty-bourgeois members of the peasantry which would inevitablybe strengthened and consolidated by the consistent appli-cation of democracy in the agrarian sphere, the bourgeoisdemocrats do not and will not realise. 
 In the proletarisation of the peasantry Mr. 
 L. 
 (again like the Narodniks and in the spirit of Revolutsionnaya Rossiya ) refuses to see a “type of development”, declaring it to be due to “the survivalsof serfdom” and “the general pathological condition of thecountryside”! Presumably after we get a constitution weshall see the end of the growth of the towns, of the flight of the poor peasants from the countryside, of the change-over of the landlords from the labour-rent system to the useof wage-labour, and so on! Depicting the beneficent effectof the French Revolution on the French peasantry, Mr. 
 L. 
speaks glowingly of the disappearance of famines and theimprovement and progress of agriculture; but about the fact that this was bourgeois progress, based on the formation of a “stable” class of agricultural wage-labourers and onchronic pauperism of the mass of the lower strata of the peasantry, this Narodnik-like bourgeois, of course, saysnever a word. 
 In short, the difference between Mr. 
 L. 
’s agrarian pro-gramme and the Social-Democratic agrarian programme re-produces in miniature with remarkable fidelity all the gen-eral differences between the minimum programmes of liberal and proletarian democracy. 
 Whether you consider these programmes as theoretically expounded by their respective ideologists or as practically applied by their respective parties and trends, or whether you look at the history of,say, 1848, you will find just these two fundamental differ-ences between the liberal and the Social-Democratic approachto the immediate practical aims: on the one hand, reformisthalf-heartedness in the struggle against the survivals of feudalism and a glossing over of the class antagonisms of “modern” society; on the other, a revolutionary struggleagainst the remnants of the old order with a view to extend-ing, developing and intensifying the struggle of classesin the new society. 
 Of course, these fundamental differ-ences, which spring from the very nature of developing capitalist society, assume very different forms in different national states and at different times. 
 An inability to rec-ognise the “old” bourgeois democracy behind the new andpeculiar forms is characteristic of its ideologists, consistentand inconsistent. 
 Under the latter head we must, for exam-ple, class Mr. 
 P. 
 Novobrantsev (see Revolutsionnaya Rossiya , Nos. 
 32 and 33), that representative of “distraught Naro-dism” who, in reference to Iskra ’s attacks on Osvobozhdeniye for being a bourgeois class publication, ironically remarks:“A fine bourgeoisie, we must say!” “Mr. 
 Struve,” Revolutsion-naya Rossiya condescends to inform us, “is a representative of the ‘intelligentsia’, and not of the ‘bourgeoisie as a class’, for he does not set out to unite or lead any classes or social estates. 
” That is all very well, gentlemen! But had you givena little thought to the matter you would have seen thatMr. 
 Struve is a representative of the bourgeois intelligentsia. 
 As to the bourgeoisie as a class, the Russian proletariat willsee it as such on the historical scene only when there is political freedom and the government is almost directly a “committee” of one or another section of the bourgeoisie. 
And only “socialists by mistake” can fail to know that it istheir duty to teach the working class to recognise the bour-geoisie both in its activities and in its ideas, both in itsmature state and in its dreamy youth. 
 As for dreaminess, Mr. 
 Novobrantsev is your man for that. 
 But our article is already so long, and Mr. 
 Novo-brantsev’s world outlook and agrarian-historical views pre-sent so much that is interesting, especially when taken parallel with those of Mr. 
 L. 
, that we must postpone their discussion until another time.

S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
, meeting in Geneva on November 27, 1903, unanimously adopted thefollowing decision. 
 Comrade Plekhanov’s co-optation of the Martovites to the editorial board constitutes outright defection on his part to the side of the Party Congress minority, a minority that Plekhanov himself more than once publicly character-ised as inclining towards opportunism and anarchism. 
 Fromthe minutes of the Party Congress and the Congress of theLeague this will be seen quite clearly. 
 This defection isa direct violation of the will of the Party Congress under the influence of the League Abroad and in defiance of theemphatically stated decision of the majority of the Partycommittees in Russia. 
 The Central Committee cannot allowsuch a violation of the will of the Congress, particularlysince in taking advantage of Comrade Lenin’s resignationto commit this act, Comrade Plekhanov was guilty of adirect breach of trust; for Comrade Lenin resigned on cer-tain conditions, in the interests of peace and good willin the Party, whereas the Martovites, by turning down theCentral Committee’s ultimatum of November 25, 57 rejected peace and thereby declared war. 
 The Central Committee therefore, by revolutionary ac-tion, takes the Party Central Organ into its own handsand declares that it will do everything in its power to securethat the will of the Party as a whole, not the will of theLeague Abroad or the treachery of an individual, shalldetermine the Party’s future. 
 Central Committee Written on November 14 (27), 1903 First published in 1928 Published according in Lenin Miscellany VII to the manuscript LETTER TO ISKRA58 The article “What Should Not Be Done” raises issues in our Party life that are so important, and at this particularjuncture so urgent, that it is difficult to repress the desire to respond immediately to the editorial board’s kind and hospitable offer to throw open the columns of their paper;and it is all the more difficult for one who has been a con-stant contributor to Iskra , especially at a time when to delay voicing one’s opinion for a week may mean forfeiting theopportunity altogether. 
 And I would like to contribute my opinion in order to prevent certain possible, if not inevitable, misunderstand-ings. 
 Let me say, first of all, that I think the author of the article is a thousand times right when he insists that it isessential to safeguard the unity of the Party and avoid new splits—especially over differences which cannot be consid-ered important. 
 To appeal for peaceableness, mildness, andreadiness to make concessions is highly praiseworthy ina leader at all times, and at the present moment in particu-lar. 
 To anathemise or expel from the Party, not only formerEconomists, 59 but even little groups of Social-Democrats who suffer from “a certain inconsistency” would certainly be unreasonable, so unreasonable that we quite understandthe irritable tone of the author of the article towards thosewhom he considers arbitrary, stiff-necked and stupid Soba-keviches 60 capable of advocating expulsion. 
 We even go further: when we have a Party programme and a Party organisation, we must not only hospitably throw open the columns of the Party organ for exchanges of opinion, butmust afford those groups—or grouplets, as the author calls them—which from inconsistency support some of the dogmas of revisionism, or for one reason or another insist upon their separate and individual existence as groups, the opportunity of systematically setting forth their differences, howeverslight these may be. 
 Precisely in order to avoid being tooharsh and stiff-necked à la Sobakevich towards “anarchistic individualism”, it is necessary, in our opinion, to do theutmost—even if it involves a certain departure from tidy patterns of centralism and from absolute obedience to dis-cipline—to enable these grouplets to speak out and give thewhole Party the opportunity to weigh the importance orunimportance of these differences and determine just where,how and on whose part inconsistency is shown. 
 Indeed, it is high time to make a clean sweep of the tra-ditions of circle sectarianism and—in a party which rests on the masses —resolutely advance the slogan: More light! — let the Party know everything , let it have all, absolutely all the material required for a judgement of all and sundry differ-ences, reversions to revisionism, departures from discipline,etc. 
 More confidence in the independent judgement of the whole body of Party workers!—they, and they alone, will be able to curb the excessive hotheadedness of groupletsinclined to splits, will be able, by their slow, imperceptiblebut persistent influence, to imbue them with the “good will”to observe Party discipline, will be able to cool the ardourof anarchistic individualism and, by the very fact of their indifference, document, prove and demonstrate the triviality of differences exaggerated by the elements tending towardsa split. 
 To the question—“what should not be done?” (what should not be done in general, and what, in particular, shouldnot be done so as to avoid a split), my reply is, first of all: do not conceal from the Party the appearance and growth of potential causes of a split, do not conceal any of thecircumstances and events that constitute such causes; and,what is more, do not conceal them not only from the Party,but, as far as possible, from the outside public either. 
 I say“as far as possible” having in mind the things that, in a secret organisation, must necessarily be concealed—but in our splits things of this kind play next to no part. 
 Broad public-ity—that is the surest, the only reliable means of avoiding such splits as can be avoided, and of reducing to a minimum the harm of splits that are no longer avoidable. 
 For indeed, just reflect on the obligations devolving on the Party from the fact that it is dealing now with themasses , not with mere circles. 
 To be a party of the masses not only in name, we must get ever wider masses to shareIn all Party affairs, steadily elevating them from politicalindifference to protest and struggle, from a general spirit of protest to the conscious adoption of Social-Democratic views, from the adoption of these views to support of themovement, from support to organised membership in theParty. 
 Can we achieve this result without giving the widestpublicity to matters on whose decision the nature of ourinfluence on the masses will depend? The workers will cease to understand us and will desert us, as a general staff without an army, if splits take place in our ranks overtrivial differences, says the author; and it is quite true. 
 Andin order that the workers may not cease to understand us, in order that their fighting experience and proletarianinstinct may teach us “leaders” something too , the organised workers must learn to keep an eye on any potential causes of splits (in any mass party such causes have always arisenand will always recur), to properly evaluate these causes, toappraise what happens in some “backwater”, in Russiaor abroad, from the standpoint of the interests of the entireParty, of the entire movement. 
 The author is thrice justified when he stresses that much will be given to our central bodies and much will be askedof them. 
 Just so. 
 And for that very reason the whole Party must constantly, steadily and systematically train suitable persons for the central bodies, must see clearly, as in thepalm of its hand, all the activities of every candidate for these high posts, must come to know even their personal characteristics, their strong and weak points, their victo-ries and “defeats”. 
 The author makes some remarkably acuteobservations, evidently based on extensive experience,about some of the causes of such defeats. 
 And just becausethese observations are so acute, it is necessary that the whole Party should benefit by them, that it should always see every “defeat”, even if partial, of one or other of its “leaders”. 
No political leader has a career that is without its defeats, and if we are serious when we talk about influencing the masses, about winning their “good will”, we must strive with all our might not to let these defeats be hushed up in the musty atmosphere of circles and grouplets, but tohave them submitted to the judgement of all. 
 That mayappear embarrassing at first sight, it may seem “offensive”sometimes to individual leaders—but we must overcomethis false feeling of embarrassment, it is our duty to the Party and to the working class. 
 In this way, and in this way alone, shall we enable the whole body of influentialParty workers (and not the chance assortment of personsin a circle or grouplet) to know their leaders and to put each of them in his proper category . 
 Only broad publicity will correct all bigoted, one-sided, capricious deviations, it alone will convert the at times absurd and ridiculous “squalls” between “grouplets” into useful and essentialmaterial for the self-education of the Party. 
 Light, more light! We need a vast orchestra; and we must acquire experience in order correctly to distributethe parts, in order to know to whom to assign the sentimen-tal violin, to whom the gruff double-bass, to whom the con-ductor’s baton. 
 Let the columns of the Party organ and ofall Party publications indeed be thrown open hospitablyto all opinions, in keeping with the author’s admirableappeal; let all and sundry judge our “janglings and wran-glings” over any “note” sounded too sharp, in the opinion of some, too flat, in the opinion of others, too raggedly, in the opinion of others still. 
 Only through a series of suchopen discussions can we get a really harmonious ensembleof leaders; only given this condition will it be impossible for the workers to cease to understand us; only then willour “general staff” really be backed by the good and con-scious will of an army that follows and at the same time directs its general staff! Lenin Iskra , No. 
 53, Published according November 25, 1903 to the Iskra text WHY I RESIGNED THE ISKRA EDITORIAL BOARD * A LETTER TO THE EDITORS OF ISKRA61 This is by no means a personal question. 
 It concerns the relations between the majority and minority of ourParty Congress, and I am bound to answer it at once, andopenly, not only because the majority delegates are bom-barding me with questions, but because the article “Our Congress” in No. 
 53 of Iskra gives an entirely false picture of the not very profound but very disruptive division amongthe Iskra -ists to which the Congress led. 
 The account the article gives of the matter is such that even with a magnifying glass no one could discover in it a single really serious cause for the division, could find so much as a shadow of an explanation of such a phenomenonas the altered composition of the editorial board of theCentral Organ, or a semblance of valid reasons for my resigna-tion from the board. 
 We parted company over the organi-sation of the Party’s central bodies, the writer of the article says, over the relations between the Central Organ and the Central Committee, over the way to apply centralism,over the limits and nature of a possible and useful central-isation, over the harm of bureaucratic formalism. 
 Is that so? Did we not rather part company over the per-sonal composition of the central bodies, over whether it was permissible, because one did not like the membership elected to them by the Congress, to boycott these centralbodies, to disrupt the practical work, to revise the decisionsof the Party Congress at the bidding of a circle of Social-Democrats abroad, such as the majority of the League? *I sent this letter to Iskra immediately after No. 
 53 appeared. 
 The editors refused to print it in No. 
 54, so I am compelled to publishit as a leaflet. 
 You know perfectly well, comrades, that this was indeed the case. 
 But the great majority of the most influential and most active Party workers do not know it yet, and so I shall briefly outline the main facts—briefly because, judgingby an announcement in No. 
 53 of Iskra , all the material relating to the history of our divergence will shortly bepublished. 
 At our Congress—as both the writer of the article we are discussing and the Bund delegation in their newly published report rightly point out—the “ Iskra -ists” were in a considerable majority, about three-fifths, accordingto my calculation, even before the withdrawal of the Bundand Rabocheye Dyelo delegates. 
 During the first half of the Congress these Iskra -ists stood together against all the anti-Iskra -ists and inconsistent Iskra -ists. 
 This was very plainly revealed in connection with two incidents duringthe first half of the Congress which are important for anunderstanding of our divergence: the Organising Committeeincident and the equality of languages incident (the latterwas the only occasion when the Iskra -ist compact majority dropped—from three-fifths to one-half). 
 During the second half of the Congress the Iskra -ists began to diverge, and by the end of the Congress the divergence was complete . 
 The controversies over Paragraph 1 of the Party Rules andover the elections to the central bodies clearly reveal thenature of this divergence: a minority of the Iskra -ists (headed by Martov) became the rallying point for a steadily increasing number of non-Iskra -ists and indecisive elements, in opposition to the majority of the Iskra -ists (which includ-ed Plekhanov and myself). 
 Over the question of Paragraph 1of the Rules this grouping did not yet take final shape, buteven so the Bundist votes and two of the three Rabocheye Dyelo -ist votes gave the Iskra -ist minority the upper hand. 
 In the elections to the central bodies the Iskra -ist majority (owing to the withdrawal from the Congress of the fiveBundist and two Rabocheye Dyelo -ist votes) became the majority at the Party Congress. 
 And it was only at this point that we parted company in the real sense of the term. 
 We disagreed profoundly, first of all, over the composition of the Central Committee. 
 After the Organising Committeeincident, at the very beginning of the Congress, the Iskra -ists hotly discussed various members ( and non-members ) of the Organising Committee as candidates for the Central Com-mittee, and at unofficial meetings of the Iskra organisation, after prolonged and heated debates, rejected one of thecandidates supported by Martov by nine votes to four, withthree abstentions; by ten votes to two, with four absten-tions, a list of five was adopted which, on my proposal , included one leader of the non-Iskra -ist elements and one leader of the Iskra -ist minority. 
 But the minority insisted on having three out of five, and as a result suffered completedefeat at the Party Congress. 
 The great battle at the Congressover whether to endorse the old editorial board of six forthe Central Organ or to elect a new trio * ended in the same way. 
 Only from this moment did the divergence become so complete as to suggest a split; only from this moment didthe minority (now already become a real “compact” minori-ty) take the course of abstaining from voting—a thing untilthen unwitnessed at the Congress. 
 And after the Congressthis divergence grew ever more acute. 
 The discontented minority resorted to a boycott, lasting for months. 
 It is quite obvious that the charges of bureaucratic formalism,of demanding unquestioning, automatic obedience, andsuchlike nonsense, which sprang from this soil, were merelyan attempt to lay the blame at the wrong door; and this issufficiently borne out by the following typical case. 
 The new editorial board (i. 
e. 
, Plekhanov and myself) invited all the former editors to contribute, which invitation, ofcourse, was at first made without any “formalism”, by wordof mouth. 
 It met with a refusal. 
 We then wrote an “official *In view of the endless talk and misrepresentation that there has been regarding this celebrated “trio”, let me point out at once that long before the Congress all comrades who were at all closely in touch were acquainted with my commentary to the draft Tagesordnung o f the Congress. 
 This commentary, which was circulated at the Congress,contained the following point: “The Congress shall elect three personsto the editorial board of the Central Organ and three to the CentralCommittee. 
 These six persons in conjunction shall, if necessary, co-opt by a two-thirds majority vote additional members to the editorial board of the Central Organ and to the Central Committee and reportto this effect to the Congress. 
 After the report has been endorsed bythe Congress, subsequent co-optation shall be effected by the editorialboard of the Central Organ and by the Central Committee separately. 
” document” (what bureaucrats!), addressed “dear comrades”, requesting them to contribute in general, and in particular to set forth their differences in the columns of the publications of which we were the editors . 
 The reply was a “formal” state-ment to the effect that they did not wish to have anything to do with “Iskra ”. 
 And, in fact, for months on end none of the non-editors did any work for Iskra . 
 Relations became exclusively formal and bureaucratic—but on whose “ini-tiative”? Underground literature began to be produced; people abroad were flooded with it, it was disseminated among the committees, and is now already beginning in part toreturn from Russia. 
 The report of the delegate for Siberia,—n’s letter on the slogans of the “opposition”, and Martov’s Once More in the Minority are all full of the most amusing charges against Lenin of being an “autocrat”, of instituting a Robespierre guillotine regime ( sic!), of having staged the political burial of old comrades (non-election to the centralbodies is burial!), and the like. 
 By the very logic of thingsthe opposition is drawn to seeking such differences of “prin-ciple” on matters of organisation as entirely preclude collaboration. 
 An especially loud outcry is raised over thecelebrated “fifth member” of the Party Council. 
 In all thesewritings, the Council is made out to be a piece of diplomacyor trickery on Lenin’s part, an instrument for the suppressionof the Central Committee in Russia by the Central Organ abroad—which is exactly the way the matter is depicted by the Bund delegation in their report on the Congress. 
 Itneed hardly be said that this difference of principle is justas nonsensical as the famous bureaucratic formalism. 
 The fifth member is elected by the Congress; consequently, it is of the majority; and the will of the majority of a Party Congress will always, however the central Party bodies maybe constituted, be manifested in the choice of definite persons. 
 How widely this kind of literature has been circulated abroad is evident from the fact that even the good Parvushas taken the war-path against the attempt to grasp all the threads in one hand and to “boss” ( sic!) the workers from some such place as Geneva ( Aus der Weltpolitik , 62 V. 
 Jahr-gang, No. 
 48, November 30, 1903). 
 In a month or two, whenall a matter of the person who enjoys the greatest confidence he reads the minutes of the Party Congress and the League Congress, our new enemy of autocracy will discover how easy it is to make a fool of oneself by accepting all manner of Parteiklatsch * at its face value. 
 The climax of the opposition’s campaign against the central bodies was the Congress of the League. 
 From itsminutes the reader will be able to see whether those whocalled it an arena for settling Party Congress scores were right or not, and whether or not there was anything in the onslaught of the opposition to provoke the Central Commit-tee to altogether exceptional measures (as the Central Com-mittee itself put it when alteration of the compositionof the editorial board held out the hope of peace in theParty). 
 The resolutions of this Congress reveal the true nature of the differences of “principle” over the question of autocratic bureaucracy. 
 After the League Congress a split loomed so threaten-ingly that Plekhanov decided to co-opt the ex-editors. 
I foresaw that the opposition would not rest satisfied withthis, and I did not think it permissible to revise a decision of the Party Congress to please a circle . 
 But still less did I think it permissible to stand in the way of possible peace in the Party, and I therefore resigned from the editorialboard, after the 51st issue of Iskra , stating at the same time that I did not refuse to continue as a contributor, and that I did not even insist, if peace and good will were established in the Party, on having my resignation madepublic. 
 The opposition demanded (not transformation of the non-existent system of bureaucracy, formalism, autoc-racy, automatism, etc. 
, but) reinstatement of the old edi-torial board, the co-optation of opposition representatives to the Central Committee, two seats on the Council, and recognition of the League Congress as lawful. 
 The CentralCommittee made an offer of peace by consenting to co-opt two of them, to turn over one seat on the Council, to have the reorganisation of the League carried out gradually. 
These terms too the opposition rejected. 
 The editors were co-opted, but peace remained an open question. 
 That was the state of affairs when No. 
 53 of Iskra appeared. 
 *Party tittle-tattle. 
— Ed. 
 That the Party wants peace and positive work is hardly open to question. 
 But articles like “Our Congress” are an obstacle to peace, an obstacle because they bring up hints and fragments of issues which are not and cannot be com-prehensible unless the story of the divergence is told infull; an obstacle because they shift the blame from a foreigncircle to the centre in charge of our practical work, whichis engaged in the difficult and arduous task of actually unit-ing the Party, and which in any case has been having to wrestle with too many hindrances to the application ofcentralism. 
 The committees in Russia are fighting againstthe disruptive activities and boycott tactics of the minority,which are obstructing the work all along the line. 
 Resolu-tions to this effect have already come in from the St. 
 Peters-burg, Moscow, Nizhni-Novgorod, Tver, Odessa, and Tula committees and from the Northern League. 
 Enough of this émigré Literatengezänk ! * Let it now be-come an example to the practical workers in Russia of “ what should not be done ”! Let the editors of the Party’s Central Organ call for a stop to all boycotts, no matter on whose part, and for concerted effort under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Party! * * * But what about the difference in shades of opinion among the Iskra -ists? the reader may ask. 
 Our answer will be: in the first place, the difference is that in the opinion of themajority one can and should advocate one’s views in the Party apart from any alteration in the personal composition of the central bodies. 
 Every circle, even of Rabocheye Dyelo -ists, is entitled, on joining the Party, to demand the oppor-tunity to express and advocate its views; but no circle, not even of generals, is entitled to demand representation on theParty’s central bodies. 
 In the second place, the difference is that in the opinion of the majority the blame for any formalism and bureaucracy falls on those who, by refusingto work under the leadership of the central bodies, made it difficult to conduct matters in a non-formalistic way. 
 In the third place, I know of one and only one difference of principle *Writers’ squabbling. 
— Ed. 
 on matters of organisation, namely, that which found expres-sion in the debate on Paragraph 1 of the Party Rules. 
 We shall endeavour to return to this question when the minutes of the Congress appear. 
 We shall then show that the factthat Martov’s formulation was carried with the help ofnon-Iskra -ist and quasi-Iskra -ist elements was no accident, but was due to its being a step towards opportunism, andthat this step is even more apparent in —n’s letter and in Once More in the Minority . 
 * The minutes will show that the author of “Our Congress” goes against the facts when heclaims that “the controversy during the discussion of theParty Rules centred almost exclusively round the organi-sation of the central bodies of the Party”. 
 Quite the contrary. 
The only controversy that really involved principles and divided the two “sides” (i. 
e. 
, the majority and minority of the Iskra -ists) at all definitely was over Paragraph 1 of the Party Rules. 
 As for the controversies over the compositionof the Council, co-optation to the central bodies, and so on,they were just controversies between individual delegates,between Martov and myself, etc. 
; they concerned what were relatively very minor details and did not give rise to any definite grouping of the Iskra -ists, who by their votes correct-ed now one, now another of us when he went too far. 
 To makeout that these controversies were the source of our disagree-ment on how centralism should be applied, what shouldbe its limits, character, etc. 
, is simply to whitewash the stand taken by the minority and the methods of the fight which they carried on to change the personal compositionof the central bodies, and which alone caused us to divergein the full sense of the term.

L. 
P. 
 TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE LEAGUE ABROAD, THE PARTY AID GROUPS, AND TO ALL PARTY MEMBERS ABROAD Comrades, The final unification of the Party now makes it essential and urgent to develop on a wide scale the activities conduct-ed by the Social-Democrats abroad and firmly unite the efforts of all working in this field. 
 Under the Party Rules (Paragraph 13), all Party work abroad is divided into two major spheres, organised ondifferent lines. 
 On the one hand, propaganda and agitationactivities abroad are under the direct charge of the LeagueAbroad and are concentrated in its hands. 
 The Central Committee will take all measures to facilitate the complete centralisation of this work in the hands of the League andto assure it autonomy in the exercise of this function. 
 Onthe other hand, assistance by the League to the movement in Russia is rendered only through persons and groups specially appointed for the purpose by the Central Com-mittee. 
 While calling upon all members of the League, all aid groups and all Party members abroad to give the Leaguethe utmost support in its work of propaganda and agitation,the Central Committee intends now to focus its efforts onthe organisation of these intermediate groups through which assistance to the movement in Russia should be rendered. 
 The Central Committee considers its tasks in this field to be as follows. 
 Assistance to the Russian movement from abroad will chiefly take the form of 1) dispatching revolutionary workers to Russia; 2) dispatching to Russia funds collected abroad; 3) gathering abroad such Russian contacts, items of news,and information as need to be communicated speedily toRussia with a view to aiding the comrades active there,preventing discovery and arrest, etc. 
; 4) dispatching litera-ture to Russia, etc. 
 While not claiming that this is an exhaustive list of all forms of direct assistance to the Russian movement fromabroad, we think, however, that it is sufficient for the timebeing to outline the chief forms and adapt the organisationwe are creating to these. 
 Experience will show how farthis organisation will need to be modified in the future. 
 To begin with the matter of dispatching people for work in Russia. 
 It would, of course, be desirable for most com-rades going there to contact directly the Central Com-mittee’s chief agency abroad—in Geneva—and secure fromit addresses, passwords, funds and the necessary instructions. 
But many of the people going will naturally not be able to come to Geneva, and the Central Committee therefore intends to appoint its agents in all foreign centres of any importance:London, Paris, Brussels, Berlin, Vienna, and others. 
 Everyperson intending to leave for work in Russia is invitedto apply to the local agent of the Central Committee, whowill take all measures to enable him to reach his destination with maximum speed and safety and to co-ordinate his first steps with the Central Committee’s general plan of allocationof forces and funds, etc. 
 The Central Committee hopes thatthe League Abroad will render these Central Committeeagents every assistance—for example, by acquainting asmany as possible of our people abroad with the functions of these agents and the conditions for contacting them, by helping to arrange for maximum secrecy of these contacts,etc. 
 Since the dispatch of people to Russia from large foreign centres is a very big job, and since one person may notalways be able to acquaint himself adequately with those being dispatched, the Central Committee will, where re-quired, appoint not one agent, but a group of agents, in accor-dance with Paragraph 13 of the Party Rules. 
 Further, as regards the dispatch of funds, the most desir-able arrangement is for the collection of funds anywhere abroad to be completely concentrated in the hands of the League and for the Administration of the League to passthem over to the Central Committee. 
 Only in urgent casesmay we be obliged, as experience suggests, to have certainsums handed over directly by local sections of the Leagueto local agents of the Central Committee, as when pressure of circumstances requires immediate aid in effecting an escape, in dispatching a person or literature, etc. 
 TheCentral Committee hopes that the Administration of theLeague will give appropriate instructions to the sectionsand will devise the most suitable forms of accounting forsums collected and expended. 
 Next, it is common knowledge, of course, that persons arriving abroad from Russia very often communicate infor-mation which would be of the utmost importance to thoseworking in Russia, as, for example, about the extent ofarrests, the need to warn comrades in places remote fromthe scene of an arrest, the need to utilise contacts in Russia which the comrade escaping or otherwise leaving had no time or opportunity to utilise, etc. 
 Of course, in proportionas all the Party work comes under the direction of the Cen-tral Committee, it will become increasingly possible togather all such contacts and information in Russia itself,which is the only normal and desirable thing. 
 But there is no doubt that for a long time yet there will be cases when comrades escaping from or legally leaving Russia will notmanage, for one reason or another, to pass on their contactsin Russia, so that this will have to be done after they arriveabroad Lastly, the Central Committee will, of course, endeavour to concentrate the transport of literature as completely as possible in the hands of a special transport group, some ofwhose members will be abroad all the time. 
 Special CentralCommittee agents will therefore be appointed to managethe Party literature depots in various foreign centres, tomaintain communication with the frontiers, etc. 
 But how-ever efficiently the business of transport is organised, there will always, of course, be gaps which will have to be filledby seizing such chances as may present themselves, by (perhaps) dispatching suitcases, utilising opportunities which may be offered by commercial or shipping arrangements etc. 
 All communications and items of information bearing on such matters should likewise be addressed to the CentralCommittee agents, with whom all such matters will be con-centrated and who will act in accordance with the CentralCommittees general plan and instructions In informing the League Administration of its plan of work, the Central Committee expresses its confidence that the League for its part will render every assistance to theCentral Committee agents abroad, and in particular willtake steps to enable these agents to acquaint themselveswidely with the aid groups, youth circles, etc. 
, etc. 
 Written in the early part of December 1903 First published in 1928 Published according in Lenin Miscellany VII to the manuscript /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR NOTE ON THE POSITION OF THE NEW ISKRA What angers me most in the position taken up by the “Martovite ” Iskra is its intrinsic dishonesty and falsehood , the attempt to evade the essence of the matter, the attempt to falsify Party opinion and judgement, to misrepresent concepts and facts. 
 And I think that the obtuseness andindifference shown by some comrades, their insensitivenessto this falsehood, can only be due to their ignorance of thefacts. 
 Ignorance must be combated by explanation, and Ishall certainly keep to my intention of explaining the whole matter in the greatest detail (if necessary, with all the docu-ments) in a special pamphlet, which I shall undertake assoon as the minutes of the Party and League Congressescome out, that is to say, very soon. 
 63 The chief distortion by which the Martovites try to deceive the Party (in their hysterical state very possibly, and even probably, primarily deceiving themselves) is, firstly, misrepresentation of the true sources and causes of the diver-gence among the Iskra -ists, and, secondly, misrepresentation of the concepts of circle spirit and disruption, of sectarianismand party spirit. 
 The first misrepresentation is that they represent as a difference of “principle” the recriminations —for that is what they actually were—exchanged by the two sides after theCongress, during the struggle between the central bodiesand the opposition. 
 These recriminations consisted in theopposition calling the majority autocrats, formalists, bu-reaucrats, etc. 
, while the majority called the opposition hysterical place-seekers , a party of rejected Ministers or hysterical rowdies ( vide the Congress of the League). 
 And now o n e side of these mutual “compliments” is being held up in the Central Organ as a difference of principle ! Isn’t that despicable? In reality the cause of the divergence was the Martov-ites’ swing-over towards the Marsh . 
 That swing-over was clearly to be seen at the Congress in the matter of Paragraph 1of the Rules and in the grouping in the elections to thecentral bodies. 
 This difference, which in a measure certainly was one of principle , is evaded and hushed up. 
 The second misrepresentation is that, when it is they who have for three months been disrupting the whole Party and all the work in the interests of a circle , in order to worm themselves into the central bodies (for no one ever restrict-ed genuine controversy or the free expression of opinion;on the contrary, the Martovites were invited and urged to write), the Martovites now, after getting into the editorial board by the back door, bring forward the ludicrous accu-sation that the majority is disruptively formalistic, bureau-cratic, etc. 
, saying nothing about their own boycott, their place-seeking, etc. 
 Isn’t that despicable? Either—or; eitherconsign the whole “squabble” to oblivion , and in that case don’t talk about it at all , do not countenance in the Central Organ any recrudescence of the squabble —for this outcry about bureaucracy is precisely a recrudescence of wretched place-seeking; or raise the question of the divergence, and in thatcase disclose everything . 
 Written December in 1903 First published in 1929 Published according in Lenin Miscellany X to the manuscript PREFACE TO THE PAMPHLET A LETTER TO A COMRADE ON OUR ORGANISATIONAL TASKS A Letter to a Comrade ,* here reprinted, was written over a year ago—in September 1902, if my memory does not deceive me. 
 At first it passed from hand to hand in manu-script copies and circulated in Russia as a statement ofIskra ’s views on organisation. 
 Then, last June, the Siberian League printed and distributed it in quite a large numberof copies. 
 It is thus already fully a matter of public knowl-edge and there are no longer any grounds for withholding itspublication. 
 The reason I had for not publishing it before—its very unfinished literary form, it being only a “roughdraft” in the fullest sense of the term—now lapses, for it is in this rough state that many practical workers in Russia have read it. 
 Furthermore, an even weightier reason forreprinting it in its rough form (I have made only the mostessential stylistic corrections) is that it has now acquiredthe significance of a “document”. 
 ** As we know, the new editorial board of Iskra already announced in No. 
 53 the existence of differences over questions of organisation . 
 Unfortunately, the editors are in no hurry to specify justwhat these differences are, confining themselves for themost part to hinting at things unknown. 
 Something must be done to help the new editorial board in its difficult task. 
 Let the old organisational views of Iskra be made known in all their details, down even to ***My opponents having repeatedly expressed the wish to avail themselves of this letter as a document, I would consider it positively— how shall I put it mildly?—awkward to introduce any changes when reprinting it.

 rough drafts; perhaps the new editorial board will then finally reveal its new organisational views to the Party under its “ideological direction”. 
 Perhaps it will then finally confide to us the precise formulation of the fundamental changes it would like to have made in our Party’s Rules ofOrganisation. 
 For, indeed, who does not understand thatit is these Rules of Organisation that embody the organisa-tional plans we have always had? If the reader compares What Is To Be Done? * and the Iskra articles on organisational matters with the Letter to a Comrade , and the latter with the Rules adopted at the Second Congress, he will be able to form a clear idea of howconsistently we, the majority of the Iskra -ists and the majority at the Party Congress, have pursued our organisa-tional “line”. 
 As to the new editorial board of Iskra , we shall be waiting, and with the greatest impatience, for astatement of its new organisational views; we shall be wait-ing for it to indicate just what it has been disillusionedin, and since when, and why it has begun to “burn the idolsit worshipped”.

 POSTSCRIPT TO THE PAMPHLET A LETTER TO A COMRADE ON OUR ORGANISATIONAL TASKS The editors of Iskra state in its 55th issue that the Central Committee and the opposition “agreed to consign to oblivion” the facts mentioned in my “Letter to the Editors of Iskra ” (“Why I Resigned from the Iskra Editorial Board”). 
 * This statement of the editors is an evasion which (to use ComradeAxelrod’s admirable style) really is formalistic, officialand bureaucratic. 
 In reality there was no such agreement, as the Central Committee’s foreign representative has plainlystated in a leaflet published immediately following the ap-pearance of the 55th issue of Iskra . 
 And there could not have been any such agreement, as should be clear to anyone who reads my letter attentively; for the opposition rejected the “peace and good will” offered by the Central Committee,one condition of which would certainly have been to consign to oblivion everything that deserved it. 
 When the editorsrejected the peace offer and declared war on the famous bureau-cracy in No. 
 53 , can they have been so naïve as to hope that the other side would keep quiet about the real origin of these fables about bureaucracy? The editors were very much displeased when I described the real origin of these fables as squabbling (Literatenge-zänk —writers’ squabbling). 
 And no wonder! But, after all, you cannot dispose of this truly unpleasant fact by mouthingsorry phrases about it. 
 We will take the liberty of asking our worthy editors two questions. 
 *See pp. 
 118-24 of this volume. 
 —Ed. 
 First question . 
 Why is one person merely amused by the most violent charges of being an autocrat, of instituting a Robespierre regime, of staging a coup, and so on and so forth, while others are mortally offended by a calm state-ment reciting the facts and telling of a demand for generals’posts that actually was put forward—so offended as toindulge in absolutely “rubbishy” talk about “personalities”,“moral aspersions”, and even “low” (where did they get that from??) “motives”? Why this difference, my good friends? Not because the “post” of general is “lower” than that ofautocrat, surely? Second question . 
 Why don’t the editors explain to the reader why (in that remote past when they belonged to the opposition and really were “in the minority”) they expressed the desire to have certain facts consigned to oblivion ? Do not the editors think that the very idea of desiring to “consignto oblivion” differences of principle is absurd and could not have occurred to any right-minded person? So you see how clumsy you are, my dear “political oppon-ents”! You wanted to annihilate me with the charge that it was I who was reducing a dispute over principles to the level of a squabble; instead, you have only confirmed m y contention as to the real origin of some of your “differencesof opinion”. 
 Further, while admitting, out of clumsiness, that there were squabbles, the editors do not trouble to explain to the reader where, in their opinion, the difference of principle ends and the squabbling begins. 
 They pass over the factthat in my letter I endeavour to draw a perfectly clear line between the two. 
 I show there that the difference of principle(which was by no means so profound as to cause a realdivergence ) arose over Paragraph 1 of the Rules and was widened by the Iskra -ist minority joining forces with the non-Iskra -ist elements towards the end of the Congress. 
 I further show that the talk about bureaucracy, formalismand the rest is chiefly just an echo of squabbles that occurred after the Congress . 
 The editors probably do not agree with this demarcation between what relates to “principle” and what should be “consigned to oblivion”. 
 Then why have they not troubledto give their own opinion as to what a “correct” demarcation between them would be? Is it not because they have not yet drawn (and cannot draw) any line between the two things in their own minds? From the article by our esteemed Comrade Axelrod in this same 55th issue of Iskra the reader may judge what this ... inability to discriminate leads to and what our CentralParty Organ is turning into. 
 Comrade Axelrod does not saya single word about the substance of our controversy over Paragraph 1 of the Rules, but confines himself to hints about “peripheral societies” that mean absolutely nothing to any-one who was not at the Congress. 
 Comrade Axelrod hasprobably forgotten how long and closely we argued overParagraph 1!—but, on the other hand, he has evolved a“theory” to the effect that “the majority of the Iskra -ists at the Congress were convinced that their main task was ... to fight the internal enemy”. 
 “In the face of this mission”,our esteemed Comrade Axelrod is firmly convinced, “theimmediate positive task became overshadowed” in the eyesof the majority. 
 “The prospects of positive work were rele-gated to the dim remoteness of an indefinite future”; the Party was faced with the more urgent “military task of pac-ifying the internal enemy”. 
 And Comrade Axelrod cannotfind words severe enough to brand this “bureaucratic * [or mechanical] centralism”, these “Jacobin” (!!?) plans,these “disrupters” who “repress and persecute” people as“mutineers”. 
 In order to demonstrate the true worth of this theory— or, rather, of these accusations against the Congress major-ity of a disruptive tendency to repress mutiny ( imaginary mutiny, it is to be supposed) and of ignoring positive work,I have only to remind the forgetful Comrade Axelrod of one(to begin with) little fact. 
 On October 6, 1903, after repeat-edly pleading with the members of the minority on account of the stupidity and disruptiveness of their boycott, Plekha-nov and I officially invited the “mutinous” writers (Comrade *By the way, I should like the editors to note that my pamphlet is appearing with the “established imprint”. 
 As a convinced centralist,I obey the “principles” laid down by our Central Organ which inits 55th issue has instituted a section where Party publications arereviewed from the standpoint of their “imprints” (as a contributionto the fight against formalism). 
 Axelrod among them) to get down to positive work; we officially told them that it was unreasonable to withdraw from this work, whether because of personal irritation or of differences of opinion (for an exposition of which we were throwing open the columns of our publications). 
 * Comrade Axelrod has forgotten this. 
 He has forgotten that his reply then was a flat refusal, without any reasons stated. 
 He has forgotten that in his view at that time, in those distant days, “positive work was relegated to the dim remoteness of an indefinite future”, which future became a much-desired present only on November 26, 1903. 
64 Comrade Axelrod has not only “forgotten” this, but gen-erally would like, would he not, to have such “personalities” “consigned to oblivion”. 
 To point out to the minority that for months on end they have been disrupting the Party, neglecting positive work, and taking up an immense amount of the energies of the Central Committee by their squabbling is to indulge in “personalities”, cast moral aspersions, and reduce a struggle between trends to the level of a squabble. 
 There is no place in the columns of the Central Organ for that. 
 But to accuse the Party Congress majority of having dared to waste time by pleading with the “mutineers”, of having disrupted the Party by their fight against ( imagi-nary ) disrupters—that is a difference of principle, for which the columns of Iskra should be “reserved”. 
 Isn’t that your view, most esteemed Comrade Axelrod? It is possible that even today, if Comrade Axelrod looks around him, he will find plenty of examples of the minori-ty’s practical workers, too, relegating “positive work” to the dim remoteness of an also desirable but still indefinite future. 
 No, it would have been wiser for you not to say anything about the attitude of the majority and the minority to positive work! It would have been wiser not to bring up a subject about which, for instance, a factory worker in the town of——writes to me as follows: Dear Comrade, “We have been informed lately, that is, since the Second Party Congress, that the Central Committee was not elected by the Congress Ed unanimously, that the Congress split in two over the relations between the Central Organ and the Central Committee, and that a so-called majority and minority arose. 
 This came down on our heads as a terrible crushing blow, because this whole questionof the relations between the Central Organ and the Central Committee was something absolutely new and unexpected for us: before the Congress it had never been raised, not only at any circlesor meetings, but, as far as I can remember, in the literature either. 
 This fact of nothing being said about it before the Congress is what I cannot understand. 
 If we are to assume that the issuedid not exist at all, then it has to be admitted that the comrades who worked so hard to unite the Party did not have a clear idea as to its organisation, that is, its structure. 
 But that is quite out of the question,because the issue which has now split the Party shows clearly that opinions as to the Party structure did exist, and were not unanimous. 
 But if that was so, why was the fact concealed? That is the first thingI want to say. 
 The second is that when it comes to the question itself, I ask myself: what structure of the Party will ensure its trend being orthodox? And at once it strikes me that another important thing, be-sides the Party’s structure, is the personnel of its leadership; that is, if the leaders are orthodox, then the Party trend will be orthodox, but if they are opportunists, then the Party will be opportunist too. 
Now, with that in mind, and knowing the personnel of the Party leadership, I am definitely in favour of the Central Organ predomi-nating over the Central Committee in the ideological direction of theParty. 
 What makes me all the more positive about it is the conditions in Russia: however orthodox the Central Committee may be, since it functions in Russia it cannot be secure against arrests, and henceagainst losing its orthodoxy regardless of its own wishes, because successors don’t always resemble the people they succeed. 
 Any com-rade who has worked on the committees for any time at all will knowof cases when even the best committee is replaced, through one of the many possible chance circumstances, by a bad committee, and vice versa. 
 But with the Central Organ it’s quite another matter: it func-tions under different conditions (since it will be located abroad), which ensure it a longer existence, and hence an opportunity of pre-paring worthy successors. 
 But I don’t know, comrade, if this questioncan be decided once and for all, that is, by having the Central Organ always predominate over the Central Committee, or the Central Committee over the Central Organ. 
 I don’t think it is possible. 
 Takea case like this: suppose the personnel of the Central Organ changes and from being orthodox becomes opportunist, as in the case of the Vorwärts 65 in Germany; could it be allowed to predominate in the ideological leadership? What would we who have been schooled in the orthodox spirit do if that happened, would we have to agree with it? No, it would be our duty to take away its right to predominate andgive that right to a different body; and if that were not done for any reason, whether a sense of Party discipline or anything else, we would all deserve to be called traitors to the Social-Democratic workers’movement. 
 That’s how I see it, and I can’t agree at all to a decision “Now, what I cannot understand at all is the fight that’s going on now between the majority and the minority, and to a great many ofus it seems wrong. 
 Look, comrade, is it a natural state of affairs whenall energies are spent on travelling around the committees for the one purpose of talking about the majority and minority? Really I don’t know. 
 Is this issue really so important that all energies shouldbe devoted to it and because of it people should look on each otherpractically as enemies? For that’s what it comes down to: if a committeeis let’s say, made up of followers of one camp, then nobody from theother camp will ever get into it, no matter how fit he may be for the work; in fact, he won’t get in even if he is essential to the work and it suffers badly without him. 
 I don’t mean to say, of course, that thestruggle over this issue should be given up altogether, no, only Ithink it should be of a different kind and should not lead us to forgetour principal duty, which is to propagate Social-Democratic ideasamong the masses for if we forget that we shall rob our Party of its strength. 
 I don’t know if it is fair or not, but when I see people tram-pling the interests of the work in the mud and completely forgettingthem, I call them all political intriguers. 
 It really hurts and fills youwith alarm for the work when you see the people at the head of itspending their time on something else. 
 When you see that, you askyourself is our Party doomed to perpetual splits over such trifles, are we incapable of waging the internal and the external struggle at the same time? What’s the use of having congresses if their decisions areignored and everybody does just what he pleases, saying that theCongress decision is wrong, that the Central Committee is ineffectu-al, and so on. 
 And this is being done by people who before the Con-gress were always clamouring for centralisation, Party discipline and so on, but who now want to show it seems, that discipline is only meant for ordinary mortals, and not for them at the top. 
 They seemto forget that their example has a terrible demoralising effect oninexperienced comrades; already we hear the workers complainingagain that the intellectuals are forgetting them because of their owndissensions; already the more impulsive are dropping their hands in despair, not knowing what to do. 
 So far all this centralisation has turned out to be nothing but words. 
 All one can hope is that the futurewill bring a change for the better. 
” 66 Written in January 1904 Published in the pamphlet: Published according N. 
 Lenin, A Letter to a Comrade to the pamphlet text on Our Organisational Tasks , Geneva, 1904 TO THE PARTY MEMBERSHIP67 A circle or a party? That is the question our Central Or-gan has posed for discussion. 
 We consider discussion of this question to be exceed-ingly timely. 
 We invite the editorial board of our CentralOrgan to begin by taking a look at itself. 
 What is thiseditorial board? Is it a circle of persons who have beentogether for so-and-so many years and who have now forcedtheir way on to the editorial board by means of a boycott, disruptive activities and the threat of a split, or is it a body of officials of our Party? Do not try to evade the point by saying that you were co-opted legally, in accordance with the Rules. 
 We do notquestion the legality of it; but we invite you not to con-fine yourselves to the formal aspect, but to answer the sub-stance of our question. 
 We want, not merely a juridical, but a political answer. 
 And we want that answer from you, gentlemen, “editors” who were never elected by the Con-gress, never appointed by the Party, and not from ComradePlekhanov, who, perhaps, had no alternative but to co-optyou in order to avoid a split. 
 Are you a circle or a body of Party officials? If you are a circle, then why this hypocrisy and sham, these phrases about a party? Have you not, in reality, dis-rupted that Party, mocking for weeks and months at itsinstitutions and its Rules? Have you not, in reality, repu-diated the decisions of the Second Congress of that Party, have you not brought matters to the point of a split, have you not refused to submit to the Central Committee and theCouncil? Have you not placed yourselves outside the Party by saying that for you Party congresses are not divine, i. 
e. 
, not binding? You trample upon the institutions and laws of the Party and at the same time are pleased to use the imprint “Central Party Organ”! But if you are Party officials, would you mind explain-ing to the Party why, and in the name of what, persons whowere not appointed by the Congress insisted on ensconcingthemselves in a central Party institution? Perhaps in the name of the “continuity” of the old family circle of editors? To think that people who at the League Congress passedresolutions about this philistine “continuity” now wantto bamboozle us with talk of the Party! Why, what righthave you to talk of a party? You describe as formalists those who take their stand on the formal decisions of the Second Congress—because you must blur and gloss over the fact that you have betrayed the trust of your comrades, who, every one of them, pledged themselves over and over again to obey the decisions of theCongress. 
 You do not submit to formal decisions when theyare against you, but at the same time you unblushingly invoke the formal rights of the League when those rights are to your advantage, you invoke the formal decisions ofthe Party Council now that you have managed, against theParty’s will, to insinuate yourselves into this, the supremeParty institution. 
 You describe as bureaucrats those who hold Party posts by the will of the Party Congress, not the caprice of an émigré circle of writers. 
 You have to do this to cover up the dis-agreeable fact that it is indeed a spirit of bureaucracy, aspirit of place-hunting that obsesses those who just could notbring themselves to work in the Party except as membersof its central institutions. 
 Yes, your behaviour has indeed clearly shown us that our Party suffers from a spirit of bureaucracy that puts office above work and shuns neitherboycott nor disruption in the effort to get into office. 
 You describe as grossly mechanical decisions passed by a majority vote at the Party Congress, but you do notconsider grossly mechanical and scandalous the methods of struggle in the colonies abroad and at the League Con-gress which gained you your shameful victory over our Partyeditorial board! You do not see anything hypocritical in protestations of recognising the Party being made by people who have fought for and obtained control of the Central Party Organ although they were a minority at the Party Congress! And you call these hypocritical efforts to whitewash your indecent, anti-Party behaviour, this preaching of anarchy,this mockery of the Party Congress, this opportunist justi-fying of circle philistinism—you call this your new orga-nisational standpoint! Comrades! Those who are serious in counting themselves members of the Party must raise an emphatic voice of pro-test and put a stop to this shameful state of affairs! Thosewho are serious about Iskra ’s three years of work and the Party Congress which it prepared, and which expressed the will of those Russian Social-Democrats who are really convinced on the basis of principle and are really working,will never allow an émigré circle to trample underfoot allthat this Party Congress achieved. 
 Either—or. 
Either we have no party and are completely in the power of an émigré writers’ editorial circle that our Congress rejected—and in that case, away with this hypocriticaltalk of a party, away with the false imprints of “Party”publications, organs and institutions! We are not theSocialist-Revolutionaries, we have no need of painted sce-nery. 
 The party of the proletariat demands the truth. 
 The party of the proletariat demands the ruthlessly outspoken exposure of the obsolete circle spirit. 
 We must have thecourage to admit that there is no party and set to work fromthe beginning, from the very beginning, to create and buildup a real party. 
 We shall not be daunted by the temporaryvictory of the circle spirit, we believe and know that the class-conscious Russian proletariat will be able to build itself a party in fact, and not just in name, a party in thesense of genuine party institutions, not in the sense of falseimprints. 
 Or we do have a party—and in that case, away with all circle interests, away with gatherings of émigré rowdies! In that case, let our Party editorial board be vacated at once by those not appointed to it by the Party Congress. 
 Inthat case, let the editorial board of the Central Organ be restored as elected by the Congress. 
 In that case, let our Party organ advocate the views of the Party majority, let our Party organ defend Party organisation and the Party institutions instead of trampling them in the mud. 
 Down with the circle spirit, and, first of all, down with it on our Party editorial board! Down with disrupters!Long live the party of the proletariat, a party able to observe in practice the decisions of the Party Congress and to respect Party discipline and organisation! Down with hypocritical talk and false imprints!

 Shakhov, Geneva, 1904 to the manuscript Speeches and draft resolutions Speeches and the draft moved on January 17 (30), 1904 ; resolution on convening first published in 1929 the Third Party Congress in Lenin Miscellany X published according to the text of the Council Minutes 1 DRAFT RESOLUTION ON MEASURES TO RESTORE PEACE IN THE PARTY, MOVED ON JANUARY 15 (28) In view of the character and forms of manifestation of the divergence among the Party membership in connection with the Second Regular Congress, the Party Council deemsit urgently necessary to call vigorously on all Party mem-bers to work together in harmony under the direction ofboth central institutions of the Party: the Central Organand the Central Committee. 
 The historical juncture through which Russia is now passing—the tremendous intensification of revolutionaryferment within the country and the international complica-tions, which may lead to war—imposes particularly seriousduties on the party of the class-conscious proletarians,who are fighting in the front ranks for the emancipation of the entire people from the yoke of the autocracy. 
 The need to work together in harmony, under the direction of both thecentral bodies of the Party, at strengthening our organisa-tion and developing the class-consciousness and solidarityof the widest possible masses of the working class has neverbeen so urgent as it is now. 
 Individual differences over all manner of questions have always arisen and inevitably will arise in a party whichrests on a vast popular movement and sets out to be the con-scious spokesman of that movement, emphatically rejectingall circle spirit and narrow sectarian views. 
 But if our Partymembers are to be worthy representatives of the class-con-scious militant proletariat, worthy participants in the world working-class movement, they must do their utmost to en-sure that no individual differences over the interpretation and methods of realising the principles of our Party programme shall interfere, or be capable of interfering, with harmo-nious joint work under the direction of our central institu-tions. 
 The deeper and broader our understanding of ourprogramme and of the tasks of the international proletariat,the more we value positive work in developing propaganda,agitation, and organisation, and the farther removed we are from sectarianism, the petty circle spirit, and considerations of place and position, the more must we strive to have differ-ences among Party members discussed calmly and on theirmerits and not to let these differences interfere with our work,disrupt our activities, impede the proper functioning of ourcentral institutions. 
 The Party Council, as the supreme institution of the Par-ty, vigorously condemns all disruptive moves, no matteron whose part, all refusals to work, all withdrawals offinancial support for the central Party treasury, all boy-cotts, which are only calculated to lower a purely ideolog-ical struggle of opinions, views and shades to the level of methods of gross mechanical pressure, the level of an un-seemly scuffle. 
 The Party is worn out by the dissensions,which have already lasted nearly six months, and insis-tently demands peace. 
 No differences among Party members,no dissatisfaction with the personal composition of one orother central body can justify boycotts or similar methods of struggle, which denote a lack of principles and ideals and show that the interests of the Party are being sacrificedto the interests of a circle, and the interests of the working-class movement to narrow considerations of place and po-sition. 
 Cases occur, of course, in our Party, as they alwayswill in every big party, when some of the members are dis-satisfied with some nuance in the activities of one or other of the central bodies, with some features of its line, or withits personal composition, etc. 
 Such members can, and should,state the causes and nature of their dissatisfaction in a com-radely exchange of opinions, or by a controversy in the co-lumns of the Party press; but it would be absolutely imper-missible and unworthy of revolutionaries to express their dissatisfaction by resorting to boycotts or refusing to supportin every way they can all the positive work co-ordinated and directed by both the central Party bodies. 
 To support both central bodies and work together under their direct guid-ance is our common and plain duty as Party members. 
 Such unprincipled, grossly mechanical methods of strug-gle as have been mentioned above are deserving of unquali-fied condemnation, for they could completely wreck thewhole Party, whose unity depends solely and entirely on thefree will of the revolutionaries. 
 And the Party Council re-minds all Party members that that free will was quite defi-nitely expressed in our common decision—to which no pro-test was raised—to regard all the decisions of the SecondCongress and all its elections as binding on all Party mem-bers. 
 Already the Organising Committee in its time, whichearned a general vote of thanks for its work in arranging the Congress, adopted in Point 18 of the Regulations for the Second Congress the following decision, which wasapproved by all the Party committees: “All decisions of the Congress and all the elections it car-ries out are decisions of the Party and binding on all Partyorganisations. 
 They cannot be challenged by any one on any pretext whatever and can be rescinded or amended only by the next Party Congress. 
” This decision, accepted by the entire Party before the Congress and reaffirmed several times at the Congress itself,was equivalent to a word of honour freely pledged by allSocial-Democrats to each other. 
 Let them not forget this word of honour! Let them at once abandon all petty mutual grievances! Let them once and for all confine the struggleof ideas within such bounds that it does not lead to breachesof the Rules or hamper practical activities and positivework! 2 DISSENTING OPINION RECORDED BY THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE JANUARY 17 (30) The representatives of the Central Committee in the Party Council consider it their duty to record a dissenting opinion on Comrade Plekhanov’s resolution. 
 The representatives of the Central Committee are pro-foundly convinced that, far from putting an end to the Partydissensions, which actually mean a complete split in theParty organisation, this resolution will, on the contrary, inflame and aggravate them still further, make them chronic, and further disrupt the Party’s positive work. 
 This resolution is, essentially, nothing but an expression of the wish of the Party Congress minority to alter the per-sonal composition of the Central Committee, ignoring thecontrary wish of the Party Congress majority. 
 This resolution, as we are firmly convinced, is essentially a continuation within the Council of the policy pursued bythe opposition ever since the Party Congress; and that policyhas been one of boycott, disruption and anarchy, with theaim of altering the composition of the Party’s central bodiesby methods which do not conform in any degree to the stan-dards of normal Party life, and which have now been condemned, too, by revolutionary public opinion as ex-pressed in resolutions by the majority of the committees. 
 This resolution expresses the wish that the Central Com-mittee should again enter into negotiations with the oppo-sition. 
 Negotiations have already been going on for over five months, causing complete demoralisation in the Party’s ranks. 
 The Central Committee has already stated that it First page of the manuscript of the “Dissenting Opinion Recorded by the Representatives of the Central Committee in the Party Council”, January 17 (30), 1904 Reduced First page of the manuscript of the “Dissenting Opinion Recorded by the Representatives of the Central Committee in the Party Council”, January 17 (30), 1904 Reduced said its last word when it consented, as far back as Novem-ber 25, 1903, to the co-optation of two in token of comradely confidence. 
 The negotiations have already entailed a tremendous ex-penditure of funds for travelling and an even more seriousexpenditure of the time and energy of revolutionaries, whohave been diverted from their work. 
 The representatives of the Central Committee do not feel justified in again renewing these interminable negotiations, which produce fresh dissatisfaction on both sides and freshcontention over posts, hampering positive work in the mostappalling way. 
 We most earnestly draw attention to the fact that such negotiations involve a complete interruption of the normal course of Party life. 
 We declare that the Central Committee lays the entire responsibility for these interruptions at the door of the mi-nority. 
 We declare that we positively and absolutely fail to see any other honest and proper solution to the present dis-sensions in the Party, any other way of terminating this unpardonable struggle over the composition of the centralbodies, than by the immediate convening of a Party Congress. 
 At the same time we feel that, now that Comrade Plekha-nov’s resolution has been adopted, our own earlier resolutionhas in effect been nullified and has become quite pointless, for which reason we withdraw it.

 Vasilyev 3 DRAFT RESOLUTION ON CONVENING THE THIRD PARTY CONGRESS JANUARY 17 (30) Being convinced that the central Party institutions are powerless to terminate the absolutely abnormal and disor-ganising relations which have developed in the Party sincethe Second Congress and have continued for over five months,the Party Council resolves to convene the Third Party Con-gress. 
 4 DRAFT RESOLUTIONS MOVED ON JANUARY 17 (30) I The Party Council requests the editorial board of the Cen-tral Organ speedily to take all measures in its power to make available to the Central Committee at a very early date the5,000-6,000 rubles about which the Central Organ and theCentral Committee have been in correspondence and whichthe central Party treasury now urgently requires owing tothe emergency created by the latest arrests in Russia. 
 II The Party Council considers it improper for the editorial board of the Central Organ to dispatch representatives tothe committees without the knowledge and consent of the Central Committee, for such action brings disorganisation into the Party and is a violation of the division of functionsbetween the two central bodies as clearly laid down by theSecond Congress. 
 III The Party Council considers it improper for the editorial board of the Central Organ to communicate to the commit-tees information on the composition of the Central Commit-tee without the consent of the latter. 
 5 SPEECHES ON MEASURES TO RESTORE PEACE IN THE PARTY JANUARY 15 (28) I I have raised the question of measures to restore peace and normal relations in the Party because the amount of mis-understandings among Party workers has reached threaten-ing proportions. 
 I do not think fruitful Party work is possi-ble unless there is some common basis which Party memberswho become involved for any reason in mutual misunderstand-ings could adhere to in their activities. 
 It is nobody’s secret that the relations between individual members and sectionsof the Party have become so abnormal that it would be diffi-cult to speak now of a united Social-Democratic workers’ party and mean it. 
 I could, of course, if necessary, furnishdetailed proof of this (recall, for instance, many of the epi-sodes in the business correspondence between the Central Com-mittee and the Central Organ); but perhaps, since everybodyknows it to be so, it would be better not to resort just now tosuch ticklish illustrations. 
 And so, we must try to adopt morevigorous measures to remove the basic evil. 
 Otherwise weshall have a position where the simplest, most routine Party acts will give rise to highly undesirable exchanges with systematic indulgence in very strong language and in thechoicest—how shall I put it mildly?—compliments, shall wesay.... 
 It may seem that I am disposed to encroach in someway on “freedom of speech”; but after all, the trouble is thatin the sphere of action all is not well either. 
 As members of the Council, whose chief function is to work for unity in the Party, against tendencies towards disunity, we must make an effort to remove the friction that is hindering the Party’s work; and given the desire, this would not be impossible. 
 And so, I ask whether some sort of measures could not be adopted against certain methods of struggle within the Partywhich reduce the latter to the condition of a disorganisedgroup and turn it into a sheer fiction. 
 Perhaps the Councilcould, in the interests of the common work, pass a resolu-tion which I have drafted and will read to you in a moment. 
 I consider it important in principle to have a Council deci-sion that would aim at eliminating and condemning imper-missible forms of struggle between individuals or groups inthe Party who are at variance on any point. 
 I repeat, the posi-tion now is much too abnormal and needs to be corrected. 
(Axelrod : “We all agree on that. 
”) I ask the secretaries to en-ter Comrade Axelrod’s remark in the minutes. 
 I shall now read the draft of the resolution I am submit ing. 
 * That is the resolution which I am moving on behalf of the Central Committee, over the signatures of both its repre-sentatives, and which could serve, not to settle any specific issues or differences between Party members, but to create a common basis for Russian Social-Democrats, who areworking in the interests of one common cause. 
 II I saw with pleasure from the speeches of both representa-tives of the Central Organ that they agree in principle thatvigorous measures ought to be taken to establish actual unityin the Party. 
 That already creates a certain common basisbetween us. 
 As regards Comrade Plekhanov’s suggestion,I consider it necessary to say the following. 
 Comrade Ple-khanov suggests that I should single out from my draft resolution the most essential practical measures for remov-ing the evils noted in Party life; the present resolution, hepoints out, has the character of an appeal. 
 Yes, my proposaldoes have the character of an appeal—but then, that is justwhat it is meant to be. 
 The idea of this “appeal” is that the Council should, in the name of both the central bodies, draw *See pp. 
 145-47 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 a dividing line between what are permissible forms of strug-gle in the Party and what are not. 
 I know that generally speaking—as such—the struggle is unavoidable; but there are different methods of struggle, after all. 
 Some methods areabsolutely abnormal and cannot be tolerated in any at allhealthy party. 
 And Comrade Martov was right in sayingthat besides a struggle of ideas there had also been whathe called “organisational complications”. 
 We, gathered here not to engage in strife but to remove abnormal conditions in the Party’s life, can and shouldinfluence our other comrades by authoritatively indicatingthe bounds of struggle permissible in the Party. 
 But I knowno other ways of influencing people than by appealing tothem. 
 Singling out the practical suggestions would be point-less here. 
 As regards the statement of the Central Organ representatives that I merely point to the abnormal stateof Party life, but do not go into its causes, I must say thatthis approach of mine is not accidental but quite deliberate,for I fear that if we touched this very tangled skein evenever so slightly, the result, instead of untangling it, would be to tangle it up still more. 
 You have to remember, after all, that where that skein is concerned we are two equallyinterested and very subjective parties, so that any attemptto untangle it would certainly not be for us to make, butonly for people who had nothing to do with the tangling. 
If we were to attempt it, we should find ourselves raking up various documents all over again, which, with the Council constituted as it is, would only lead to more ... scuffles. 
 Let us take as our starting-point the position as it exists, for there is no getting away from realities, and I am quiteready to agree with Comrade Martov that all the differencesand conflicts are not to be removed by some pious homily. 
 That is so; but then, who could act as arbiter in these regret-table aspects of our Party life? Not we ourselves at any rate,I am persuaded; no, it would have to be a wide circle ofpeople—devoted practical revolutionaries who have had nopart in the scuffles. 
 While carefully steering clear of the causesof our dissensions, I shall, however, venture to illustrate my idea with one example from our recent past. 
 The struggle has now been going on for five months. 
 During this timethere have been, I should think, as many as fifty mediators who tried to put an end to the dissensions in the Party, but I only know of one whose efforts in this respect produced rela-tively useful, if very modest, results. 
 I am referring to Com-rade Travinsky,69 a person who, let me point out, is up to the ears, so to speak, in positive practical revolutionary work,so that his attention has been occupied almost exclusivelyby that work and he has had no share in the dissensions. 
 Itis only these fortunate circumstances, I would say, that ac-count for his peace-making attempts having had some modicum of success. 
 I think that if people like that were to take a handin analysing the causes of the unfortunate position in theParty, it would be possible to untangle the skein which nowhas us perplexed. 
 We, however, should beware of going intothe causes of the dissensions, for this could lead, against our own will, to our dealing one another new wounds (to use Comrade Martov’s expression) in addition to the many oldones still very far from healed. 
 That is why I am against ana-lysing the causes and favour looking for means that wouldat least keep the methods of struggle within more or less per-missible bounds. 
 There are only two alternatives: if it is possible to do something along these lines, then we must try to do it; but if not, if the contending sides are not to be in-fluenced by authoritative suasion, the only remaining possi-bility is to apply to those third persons, uninvolved in thehostilities and engaged on their positive practical tasks,of whom I spoke before. 
 I doubt whether we could ourselves convince one another of one or the other side being right. 
 I don’t think that is possible. 
 III I do not quite understand Comrade Plekhanov’s proposal. 
 He says there should be some sort of practical measures; but surely, my draft already envisages such a practicalmeasure. 
 We have only to declare, to declare with authority,that a normal struggle, a struggle of ideas, a struggle carriedon within definite bounds, is permissible, but that boycotts,refusal to work under the Central Committee’s direction, refusal of financial support for the central Party treasury, and so on, are not permissible. 
 We are told that mere wordswill not convince anyone. 
 I will not be so bold either as to assert that this will be enough to establish good will between the two sides in the Party, because the disease that has to be cured has indeed gone very far and a very solid wall, as Comrade Martov puts it, has indeed grown up between thetwo sides. 
 We may not succeed in breaking down that wall,since we ourselves erected it; but that we who dealt one an-other the severest wounds may by an authoritative appeal inour capacity of Council members restrain comrades from un-worthy forms of struggle is not at all impossible. 
 And as regards demolishing the wall, I think time will then do itswork and everything will tend to abate. 
 As to the point thatsome passages in the appeal may be interpreted by each sidein its own way, I think that the same thing could apply toanything that we might say. 
 ( Axelrod : “That is why it is nec-essary not just to talk, but to act. 
”) Further, I fail to under-stand why Comrade Axelrod thinks that what I proposemight only prove a fresh source of strife. 
 I repeat, we maynot break down the wall between the two sides in the Party,since we have ourselves done a great deal to erect it; butthose of our comrades who, being engaged in practical work, have kept aloof from our dissensions could break it down. 
 Comrade Martov, as I saw with pleasure today, agrees inprinciple with this idea of the useful role in settling our dis-sensions that might be played by other comrades, who havenot been involved in the dissensions. 
 But apart from thatit seems to me that the very fact of representatives of the central bodies agreeing that such-and-such methods of strug-gle were allowable and such-and-such were not—that that initself could make the initial breach in the wall dividing thetwo sides, after which the present abnormality of Party lifecould diminish. 
 IV Comrade Plekhanov’s proposal arouses in me very mixed feelings. 
 By talking about the causes of the struggle, he comesstraight back to the wounds which Comrade Martov has point-ed out we have been dealing each other. 
 What I try to do in my draft is draw a line between what is permissible in our struggle and what is not, no matter who makes the attacks. 
If we started going into who did what and when, it would sion. 
 For us to be our own arbiters is, just psychologically, morally, quite impossible. 
 If we again proceed here to dis-cuss what has produced the strained relations among the Party membership, shall we ourselves be able to rise abovethe level of petty squabbling? ( Axelrod : “Yes, we shall!”) I do not share Comrade Axelrod’s optimism. 
 ComradePlekhanov in his analysis of the causes of the split in theParty gave his own interpretation of the facts, with which I do not agree. 
 But if we start arguing, we shall have to fetch out the minutes and turn to them for information. 
For example, Comrade Plekhanov says that over the elec-tion of the central bodies the Congress divided into twopractically equal parts, that a single delegate who crossedover from the majority to the minority thereby equalised the numbers of the two halves of the Congress, that therefore the Central Committee only represents one part of the Party,and so on. 
 But you cannot argue like that; it just isn’tpossible, after all, to talk of the Central Committee onlyhaving been elected by one part of the Party. 
 Many, per-haps, would now vote on various matters otherwise than they did at the Congress; I might vote differently on many points myself; but that is not to say that the possible changesand new combinations in this respect in any way invalidatethe results of the earlier voting. 
 When it is a question ofa struggle, there is always a division of the whole intoparts. 
 Yes, the Central Committee now —but not at the Congress—is the representative of a part; but I know very well that in the opinion of the comrades the Central Organtoo is, in the same way, the representative only of a part. 
From one standpoint only could I acknowledge ComradePlekhanov’s expression correct, namely, from the stand-point of the split that does in fact exist. 
 It is not because the Congress did something wrong that one can speak of the composition of one or other of the central bodies being“abnormal”, but solely because, there being such-and-suchcircumstances, people refuse to work together.... 
 Thus, nosooner do we touch on the causes of the abnormality thanwe again get involved in unravelling a skein which we, far from being able to untangle, will only tangle the more. 
 That many are dissatisfied with the composition of the CentralCommittee is true; but it is equally true that a good many people are dissatisfied with the present composition of the Central Organ. 
 To Comrade Martov’s question of whether it is permissible to “break up” existing organisations, I would reply: “Yes, to reconstruct organisations is entirelypermissible!” Is it permissible for a competent Party au-thority to remove a particular person from a particular kindof revolutionary work? My answer is: “Yes, it is!” But if Iwere to ask why and how a given “encroachment” on the integrity and inviolability of an organisation arose, why so-and-so was not assigned to such-and-such a sphere of Partywork, and so forth, I should again be reaching out towardsthat skein which it is beyond us to untangle. 
 Thus, the matterof whether or not it is permissible to “break up” organisationsalso brings us back to the disagreements. 
 All of which goes to prove that to argue now about the causes of our dissen-sions would be a completely useless and even harmful wasteof time. 
 Now let me come back to the question of proportion-al representation. 
 One could speak of that only by startingfrom recognition of an already existing split. 
 We are hererepresentatives of two contending sides.... 
 ( Plekhanov : “We have met here as members of the Council, not as contending sides. 
”) Comrade Plekhanov’s remark conflicts with his ownresolution, which speaks of the dissensions in the Party hav-ing split the Party into two halves, one of the halves, accord-ing to the resolution, being completely unrepresented onsuch a central body as the Central Committee. 
 Of course, officially we are not the representatives of two contending sides, but since that representation emerges from the courseof our debates, I had a logical right to speak of it. 
 ( Plekha-nov: “The expression you used was that we had met here as the representatives of two contending sides, and that is whatcaused my remark. 
”) I will not deny that perhaps the expres-sion I used was not quite accurate.... 
 ( Plekhanov : “It was incorrect. 
”) Perhaps it was even incorrect, I shan’t argue thepoint. 
 I am only saying that Comrade Plekhanov’s resolutionshifts the argument to the basis of de facto recognition of the split. 
 We have split, that is the fact I am noting. 
 If it werenot the case, the resolution would be out of order. 
 The Party majority is dissatisfied, too, with the composition of the Central Organ, in which four out of the five editors belongto the minority. 
 The Central Committee could put forward the same claim for a change in the composition of the Cen-tral Organ as is now being made in relation to the Central Committee. 
 Essentially, Comrade Plekhanov’s resolution amounts to a statement of the terms of only one side.... 
(Plekhanov : “I do not belong to either majority or minority. 
”) Comrade Plekhanov tells us he does not belong to eithermajority or minority, but no one else in the Council willsay that. 
 Looked at formally, from the standpoint of the Rules, the resolution moved by Comrade Plekhanov is out of order. 
 But, I repeat, actually one can understand it inso-far as it proceeds from the fact of the split. 
 But if one sideis stating its “terms”, the other would be similarly entitledto present “terms”. 
 We do not stand above the “two sides”,we are ourselves those “two sides”. 
 Consequently, if we are going to recognise that actually the Party has split, we must also recognise that there is only one radical way of resolvingour disputes and “misunderstandings”, namely, to apply tothird persons. 
 There are people in the Party, asI said before, who are engaged in positive work and havehad no part in the struggle of “majority” and “minority”. 
 Those are the people to turn to. 
 V I do not agree with either Martov or Plekhanov. 
 They say there can be no question of such a resolution being out of order, and adduce two arguments. 
 1) Martov’s argument is that the Council is the Party’s supreme institution. 
 Butdon’t forget that the competence of the Council is limitedby special provisions in the Rules—a thing which ComradeMartov himself went to no small pains to secure. 
 2) Thesecond argument is that by this resolution the Council would only be voicing its opinion and recommendation. 
 The Council can, of course, voice an opinion and recommendation,but without attempting to do more. 
 ( Plekhanov : “Of course! Of course!”) The Council can only suggest co-optation to theCentral Committee; but in that case the Central Committeewill demand a change in the composition of the Central Organ. 
 I am willing, under certain conditions, to agree to proportional representation. 
 But I ask, is there proportionalrepresentation on the Central Organ? The composition of the Central Organ is one to four, and even that one is a person who belongs to neither majority nor minority. 
 The Central Committee on an earlier occasion made an offer of two to nine;70 it made it at a time of total dissension, with a split impending. 
 In a sense, all disagreement is a split, and whentwo halves will not work together, then it is an actual split. 
Only from the standpoint of a split could we acknowledgeComrade Plekhanov’s resolution as making sense. 
 It could be regarded as an ultima ratio ; * but in that event both sides would be equally entitled to have the composition of thecentral bodies changed. 
 I am firmly convinced that the Cen-tral Committee, for its part, is dissatisfied with the composi-tion of the Central Organ. 
 The moment we touch on the que-stion of the past Congress, there will be a clash and we shall get nowhere. 
 Thus, for example, Plekhanov claims that the Congress did not elect a third person to the editorial boardbecause there was no suitable third person. 
 I maintain that the Congress did not elect a third because it was convincedthat Comrade Martov would join the board. 
 The same canbe said of the composition of the Council. 
 Many people at the Congress thought that Comrade Martov would sit on the Council in the capacity of member of the editorial board. 
The majority can say, and will, that if there is to be propor-tional representation, then the Central Organ should beaugmented with another six members, belonging to whatis known as the majority. 
 But that sort of argument will not help us towards the desired end, for which reason I be-lieve Comrade Plekhanov’s resolution is not as good as mine. 
My resolution about “the permissible and the impermissible”would have this significance, that we, as representatives ofthe contending sides, would be calling on the rest of the com-rades to keep within the bounds of permissible forms of struggle. 
 We should not take a purely juridical view, for actually our common recognition of the fact that the relations in theParty are abnormal is equivalent to recognising that weare two contending sides, the Central Organ and the CentralCommittee. 
 ( Plekhanov : “This is a meeting of the Council, not of the editorial board. 
”) Yes, I am not forgetting that. 
 *Last resort. 
— Ed. 
 From the juridical standpoint we cannot speak of propor-tional representation on the central bodies. 
 But from the political standpoint, too, it is inadvisable to operate with this idea, for we should have to defer to the wishes of oneside without hearing the wishes of the other. 
 There is no thirdparty between us who could settle our dispute. 
 Yet onlythe opinion of such a third party could have weight, bothpolitical and moral. 
 An actual split exists, and we are on the eve of a formal split if the minority persists, without caring what means it uses, in trying to make itself themajority. 
 6 SPEECHES ON MEASURES TO RESTORE PEACE IN THE PARTY JANUARY 16 (29) VI I think it necessary to reply mainly to the detailed objec-tions advanced by Comrade Martov; but so as not to leaveComrade Plekhanov’s objections unanswered either, I shallfirst touch briefly on these. 
 My impression was that he wasin principle in favour of proportional representation.... 
 (Plekhanov : “No!”) Perhaps I misunderstood him, but that was my impression. 
 In our Party organisation the principle ofproportional representation is not practised, and the sole cri-terion of the lawfulness of the composition of any body whosemembers were elected at a congress is the clearly expressedwill of the congress majority. 
 But we are told here that the lawful elections at the Congress have produced a “lawful” state of affairs that is worse than an unlawful one. 
 That istrue, but why is it so? Is it because the majority was a slightone, or because the minority has in effect brought about asplit? When people talk about the Central Committee havingbeen elected by only twenty-four votes, that is, by a tiny margin, and claim that that is the reason for all the unhappy complications in Party life since, I declare that that is not so. 
As to Comrade Plekhanov’s remark about my “formalisticmentality” preventing me from going to the root of the matter,I must say I am at a loss to know what, properly speaking,this means. 
 Perhaps the “root of the matter” lies in the Con-gress? In that case we are all formalists, for, casting our minds back to the Congress, we must go by its formal decisions. 
 If, on the other hand, the “root of the matter” lies outside the Congress, just where does it lie? Yes, the way things have gone, the state of affairs in the Party is worse than unlawful (a very serious thing to say), but the whole question is, whyhas this happened? Is the Congress to blame, or whatoccurred after the Congress? Unfortunately, ComradePlekhanov does not put the matter like that. 
 I turn now to the remarks of Comrade Martov. 
 He asserts that the minority does not and did not refuse to work togeth-er with us. 
 That is not true. 
 For three months—September,October and November—many representatives of the mi-nority gave practical proof of not wanting to work togetherwith us. 
 In such cases the boycotted side only has one courseopen to it—to make an agreement, a deal with the “offended” opposition that refuses to work and is leading the Party to-wards a split, for this very fact of refusing to work togetheris nothing but a split. 
 When people tell you point blank thatthey will not work with you, thus proving in practice thatthe “united organisation” is simply a fiction, that, actually,it has already been wrecked, they are certainly advancing a shattering , if not a convincing, argument.... 
 I pass on to Comrade Martov’s second objection—concerning the resig-nation of Comrade Ru 71 from the Council. 
 This question in-volves two separate issues. 
 In the first place, was it in orderfor Ru to be appointed to the Council from the editorial boardwhen he was not himself a member of the board? I think it was in order. 
 ( Martov : “Of course it was!”) Please enter Martov’s interjection in the minutes. 
 Secondly, are Councilmembers subject to recall at the will of the bodies that dele-gated them? This is an intricate point, which can be inter-preted both ways. 
 In any case, the fact is that Plekhanov,who from November 1 onwards remained the sole member of the editorial board, did not recall Ru from the Council right up to November 26, when Martov and Co. 
 were co-opted. 
 Ruresigned of his own accord, it was a concession on his partso that no controversy should start over him. 
 ( Plekhanov : “It seems to me that arguments about Comrade Ru are outof place here. 
 The question is not on our agenda and I don’t see why we should waste precious time discussing what for us is an extraneous matter. 
”) I must point out that at our lastmeeting Comrade Martov asked to have entered in the min-utes his explanation on this point—an explanation with which I totally disagree—so that if the other side is not allowed to give its opinion on the subject too, the picture given here in the Council will be a one-sided, incorrect one. 
(Plekhanov : “I wish to emphasise that the question is not on the agenda and has no direct bearing on the main subjectunder discussion. 
”) Lenin , protesting against this formulation, appeals to the Council to decide as to his right to give his own account, as against Martov’s, of a fact meeting here with such divergentinterpretations. 
 ( Plekhanov again indicates that discussion of the question of Ru is out of place. 
) Lenin insists on his right to appeal to the Council for per-mission to speak on a point that has already been brought up in the Council and has aroused argument. 
 ( Martov : “Since Comrade Lenin has raised the very important questionof the right of the bodies represented on the Council to recalltheir delegates, let me state that I shall table a specialmotion to have this question settled once and for all. 
 Perhapsthis statement will satisfy Lenin and induce him to drop this matter of Ru from the present discussion. 
”) Comrade Martov has not only not disproved but has con-firmed that I am right in my intention to present ComradeRu’s resignation from the Council in its proper light hereand now. 
 Please note that my explanations on this pointhave only been in answer to Comrade Martov’s remarks concerning it. 
 (Plekhanov informs Martov and Lenin that the question of Ru is not subject to present discussion, as notbeing among the problems on which the attention of theCouncil should at this session be centred. 
) I protest againstComrade Plekhanov’s statement that it is out of place to dis-cuss the question of Comrade Ru, who held that Council members were not recallable, so that his resignation from the Council must be viewed as a concession made to the opposi-tion in the interests of peace and good will in the Party. 
(Plekhanov: “Since the Council apparently has nothingagainst an exchange of opinion on the subject of ComradeRu, by all means let Lenin go on with it. 
”) I have already finished. 
 (Plekhanov: “If you have finished, I suggest that the Council should now discuss the resolutions movedyesterday by Comrade Lenin and myself. 
”) I agree with Comrade Martov that the Council resolutions would have, not juridical, but moral significance. 
 Comrade Plekhanov has suggested that it would be desirable if I were to join the editorial board. 
 ( Plekhanov : “I did not say that. 
”) At any rate, those were your words as I noted themdown: “The best thing would be if Lenin joined the editorialboard and the Central Committee co-opted three. 
” ( Ple-khanov : “Yes, I said that under certain conditions, in order to secure peace in the Party, Comrade Lenin might be included on the editorial board and minority representatives co-opted to the Central Committee. 
”) Answering the question put to me as to just what change in the editorial board of the Central Organ would be consid-ered desirable, it would be easy for me to cite the opinion of the “majority”, who have indicated the desirability of Comrades Axelrod, Zasulich, and Starover leaving the board. 
Further, I must point out that in the activities of the CentralCommittee there has not been a single case of anyone beingbarred from Party work. 
 Similarly, I cannot leave withoutprotest Comrade Martov’s statement that the Central Com-mittee became an instrument of warfare of one side against the other. 
 The Central Committee was appointed as aninstrument for the performance of Party functions, not as aninstrument of “warfare of one side against the other”. 
 Thisassertion of Comrade Martov’s is completely contrary to thefacts. 
 No one can cite a single fact to show that the Central Committee started and waged “war” on the minority. 
 On the contrary, it was the minority that, by its boycott, madewar, which inevitably provoked resistance. 
 Then, too, Iprotest against the assertion that the alleged lack of con-fidence in the Central Committee hinders peaceful positivework more than the lack of confidence in the Central Organ. 
 As to the centre of the discord not lying abroad, but in Russia, as Comrade Martov insists is the case, I have to saythat the Party documents will prove the reverse. 
 ComradeMartov, referring to the document of November 25, 72 said that the Central Committee had itself admitted in principlethat its composition was one-sided, since it had agreed to co-opt two of the minority. 
 I protest against this interpreta-tion of that document, for I myself had a share in drawingit up. 
 The Central Committee’s action had an entirely different significance. 
 It was not because it acknowledged its composition to be one-sided that the Central Committee agreed to this co-optation of two, but because we saw what was virtually a complete split in the Party. 
 Whether thepicture we formed of the situation was right or not is anothermatter.... 
 Rumours reached us that preparations were goingon for publishing a new organ.... 
 ( Plekhanov : “If we are going to bring in rumours, we shall get nowhere. 
” Axelrod : “I for my part have heard that preparations for publishing a new organ are going on now.... 
”) I appeal to the Council: sinceComrade Martov has interpreted the Central Committee doc-ument in a certain way, I am obliged to present my owninterpretation of it.... 
 I do not understand why my remarkhas occasioned so much excitement. 
 ( Plekhanov : “It is not a matter of excitement but of references to rumours being out of place. 
”) I may be told that my motives were notvalid. 
 Perhaps not. 
 But I put on record in any case thatthey were of the nature I have just indicated. 
 To resume: Comrade Martov has impugned the Central Committee’s motives in agreeing to the co-optation of two. 
 But I declare that the Central Committee was actuated by the conviction that a virtual split already existed in the Partyand that we were on the eve of a complete formal split, inthe sense of the publication of a separate organ, separatetransport arrangements and a separate organisation inRussia. 
 Now on a point of procedure: Comrade Martov’s remark had to do with the substance of the question, not with procedure. 
 And I want to ask the Council: was the chair-man right in acting as he did in this case? VII Comrade Martov declares that I plunged straight off into polemic instead of calmly and peacefully discussing thegeneral question of devising measures for peace in the Party. 
I cannot agree with that, because the polemic was started by none other than Comrade Martov himself. 
 There is nothingpolemical in my draft resolution. 
 Not for nothing did Comrade Axelrod describe it as a “pastoral exhortation”—and pastoral exhortations, as we know, do not go in for polemic. 
And indeed, all I spoke of in it was the bounds within which any internal struggle in the Party must be kept: what forms of such struggle can be accounted permissible, and what forms must be acknowledged impermissible and fraught with danger not only to the normal course of Party life, but to theParty’s very existence. 
 Moreover, I carefully tried to avoidan approach that might involve us in further fruitless con-troversy—in my proposal I endeavoured not to start from anappraisal of the methods of struggle that have actually marked the nearly six months’ war between the two sides in the Party. 
 Comrade Martov would not keep the matter on thisplane and chose to indulge in polemic. 
 Nevertheless, I shallbe ready, should it be desired, to go back afterwards to whereI started. 
 As for the present, let me say the following. 
 Com-rade Martov quoted Travinsky as having welcomed the co-optation of the old editors to the editorial board. 
 I think it necessary to emphasise here that private conversations ornegotiations do not count. 
 All official negotiations were con-ducted by Travinsky in writing. 
 As to his private remarks,Comrade Martov apparently misunderstood them, and some other time , should it be necessary, I can prove it. 
 Further, Comrade Martov said there were all sorts of short-comings in the activities of the Central Committee, andthereby he again entered the domain of polemic. 
 There mayindeed be shortcomings in the Central Committee’s activi-ties, but for a representative of the Central Organ to criticisethose activities is nothing but polemic. 
 I for my part find that the activities of the Central Organ have gone off the right track; but for all that I did not start out here by criti-cising the line the Central Organ’s activities have taken, butby stating that there is mutual dissatisfaction between the Central Committee and the Central Organ. 
 I also protestagainst the assertion that my resolution, if adopted by the Council, would turn the latter into an “instrument of war-fare”. 
 My appeal speaks only of what forms of struggle arepermissible and what forms are not.... 
 Where does an“instrument of warfare” come into that? Comrade Axelrod saidI had “started with a toast and ended with a requiem”, andaccused me of having devoted all my efforts to proving that there was a split in the Party. 
 But surely, we started out yesterday by acknowledging that there was a split.... 
 Further,by way of proving that the centre of the discord does not /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR lie abroad, Comrade Martov quoted Comrade Vasilyev’s letter of December 12, which says that in Russia things are sheer hell. 
73 To that let me say that it does not necessarily take strong groups to “create a hell”, for it is petty and petti-fogging squabbles that oftenest and easiest create big imped-iments to the work. 
 I have mentioned my letter of Septem-ber 13 to one of the former editors. 
 I am going to publishthat letter. 
 74 Comrade Plekhanov says the word “Marsh” is an insult. 
 Let me remind you, however, that in the Ger-man socialist press and at congresses of the German Partythe term versumpft * evokes scoffing sometimes, but never cries of having been insulted. 
 Neither Comrade Vasilyevnor I had any thought of insulting anyone in using the word. 
When there are two sides, each with its definite trend, irresolute waverers between the two are described by the term “Marsh”, instead of which one could, I suppose, use “goldenmean. 
” To call the Central Committee eccentric may be witty, but it also leads to polemic. 
 After all, I could say the same ofthe Central Organ. 
 I am told that my “appeal” is a homoeo-pathic remedy for an allopathic evil. 
 I do not deny that the remedy I propose is only a palliative; but then, we cannotfind allopathic remedies here . 
 If you are going to talk of the need for “allopathic”, radical remedies for this evil, then goall the way. 
 A remedy like that does exist, and this one rad-ical remedy is none other than a congress . 
 For five months now we have been trying vainly to come to an understanding (“That’s not so!”) ... yes, it is so, and I shall prove it to youwith documents.... 
 We have been at it ever since September15 and have not achieved it yet. 
 Wouldn’t it be better inthat case to appeal to the body that Comrade Martov toospoke of yesterday?—and that body can only be a congress of Party workers. 
 The Party Congress—that is the body that decides about the “conductor’s baton”. 
 One of the reasons wehave congresses is to “fight” over the “conductor’s baton”(not in the crude sense of the word, of course). 
 There a strug-gle is waged by way of ballots, by way of negotiations withcomrades, and so forth, and there this struggle over the composition of the central bodies is in order, but outside *Of the Marsh. 
— Ed. 
 congresses it should have no place in Party life. 
 And so, while my “pastoral message” may be a palliative, no other, more radical remedy exists except a congress, if you do not want to make the evil a chronic one. 
 ComradeAxelrod pointed out that in Western Europe the members ofthe central institutions paid due regard to any oppositionto their policy even in the remotest corners of the Party, andtried, by negotiating with the opposition, to smooth things out.... 
 But then, our Central Committee is doing the same. 
 The Central Committee sent two of its members abroad forthat purpose, 75 the Central Committee has negotiated with various opposition representatives dozens of times, prov-ing to them the absurdity of their arguments, the ground-lessness of their fears, etc. 
, etc. 
 Let me say that this is an impossible waste of energy, money and time, and in that sense we really do have something to answer for beforehistory. 
 Coming back again to the matter of practical suggestions, I repeat that you only have one radical means of ending thisunhappy period of polemic—a congress. 
 My resolution was intended to bring the struggle in the Party within more nor-mal bounds.... 
 We are told that that will not remove thesplinter, that the trouble lies deeper.... 
 In that case it is onlythe summoning of a congress that can extract the splintercompletely. 
 VIII It is absurd to describe as insulting what amounts to a demand for definiteness and precision. 
 We have seen dozensof times (and particularly at the League Congress) whatcountless misunderstandings and even rows result from incor-rect accounts of private conversations. 
 That is a fact which it would be strange to deny. 
 I say that the private remarksof Comrade Travinsky have been misunderstood both by therepresentative of the Central Organ and in part by ComradePlekhanov. 
 Here is what Comrade Travinsky writes me,among other things, in a letter of December 18: “We have just learned that the editorial board has circulated to the committees an official letter of the most invidious [I am toning down a stronger expression] character. 
 In it the editorial board openly comes out against the Central Commit-tee and threatens that through the Council it could even now compel the co-optation of anyone it chose, but that it does not wish to resort yet to such measures and calls the atten-tion of the committees to the narrow exclusiveness andincapacity of the Central Committee and the illegitimacy ofthe co-optation of Lenin.... 
 A host of sallies of a personalnature. 
 In a word, a disgraceful and ... [I again omit a too strong expression] breach of all the promises made to me. 
 I am thoroughly disgusted. 
 Is it possible that Plekhanovhad a part in this? The Ekaterinoslav Committee is deeplyincensed at the letter and has sent a very sharp reply.... 
 Nowthe minority is recklessly severing the connecting bonds. 
The letter circulated to the committees is, in my opinion, the last straw and an open challenge. 
 And I for one find that Lenin has every right to publish his letter outside Iskra . 
 I am sure the other comrades too will have nothing against it. 
” There you have proof that the idea formed of Comrade Travinsky’s opinion is mistaken. 
 Comrade Travinsky couldexpect co-optation to take place since he hoped peace and good will would be established in the Party; but his hopes entirely failed to materialise. 
 What happened was that, instead of peace, the editorial board of Martov and the rest started war on the majority. 
Whereas Travinsky had hoped, and had had a right to hope,for peace. 
 What happened was that Plekhanov’s attempts to restrain the “anarchistic individualists” did not succeed (in spiteof his efforts). 
 Accordingly, the hopes entertained by bothTravinsky and myself—hopes of Plekhanov being able tokeep the new editorial board from warring on the majority—these hopes did not materialise. 
 Which only goes to show that hopes do not always materialise; when I resigned from the editorial board, it was also in the hope that this wouldmake for peace, but my hopes did not materialise either. 
 Noone denies that private negotiations occurred, only you haveto distinguish between expressions of the hopes and expecta-tions of individuals and decisions of official bodies. 
 There is nothing insulting to the members of the Council in my remark that one cannot draw conclusions here from privatenegotiations. 
 I emphatically deny that Comrade Travinsky expressly promised co-optation to the Central Committee. 
 Undoubtedly, he departed hoping for peace, and as a result of that peace he could expect co-optation, but he could not expressly promise it. 
 Against my appeal Comrade Martov advances the argu-ment that it contains the attacks made by only one side. 
Nothing of the kind. 
 I can, if it comes to that, move anotherresolution, modifying the expressions Comrade Martov does not like, but his contention that my resolution is one-sided is nonsense. 
 Earlier it was said of my resolution that it smackedof a pastoral message, that it was full of truisms, and soon—but no one ascribed to it a tendency to inflict newwounds. 
 Comrade Martov charges me with evading a straightanswer to Comrade Plekhanov’s question of whether the Central Committee is or is not willing to co-opt representa-tives of the “minority”. 
 But how could we give you an an-swer to that question if we do not know what all the rest ofthe nine Central Committee members think of the matter now?(Plekhanov : “You misunderstood Comrade Martov. 
”) To say that I am deliberately evading is ridiculous. 
 I simply could not give the answer for not giving which I am being accused of evasion. 
 I have said plainly that the dissatisfaction withthe composition of the central bodies is mutual. 
 One hasto reckon with the opinion of other comrades too, after all. 
I am told: we must try to come to an understanding; but wehave been trying to do that for the past five months. 
 Com-rade Martov’s suggestion that by calling for a congress the Central Committee testifies to its own bankruptcy and impo-tence is therefore simply laughable. 
 Hasn’t the CentralCommittee already made every possible effort to resolve theconflict by domestic means? “The Central Committee willbe demonstrating its inability.... 
” Inability to do what? To wage the struggle? Or to bring about peace in the Party? Yes indeed! And the attacks to which my proposal has beensubjected here abundantly prove it. 
 What your resolutiontalks about is gaining ground from the adversary, so tospeak; but then a demand like that gives rise to counter-demands, and I will even put the question in this way: has the Central Committee the right to start negotiating again on that basis? There are committees, after all, which cen-sured the Central Committee for making concessions to the League. 
76 You want us to reckon with the minority and not reckon with the majority. 
 That is funny. 
 And avoidance of a congress would under these conditions smack of fear-ing a congress. 
 That is why we admit ourselves powerless,but not in the sense Comrade Martov means. 
 The CentralCommittee is indeed powerless to end the dissensions inthe Party, and that is why we are proposing to the Councilthat a congress should be convened. 
 Next, the purely juridical point of the Council’s power to convene one. 
 Comrade Mar-tov’s interpretation of it is totally incorrect. 
 What theRules say is: “The congress is convened (if possible not lessthan once in two years) by the Party Council. 
” Consequently,the Council has the power to convene a congress at any time . 
 It is obliged to convene a congress only in one specific case. 
 (Martov : “From the Rules it directly follows that the Council is obliged to convene a congress when demanded bya specified number of competent organisations, or upon thelapse of two years after the previous congress. 
 Thus, untilthe two years are up or until the specified number of orga-nisations call for a congress, the Council cannot convene one. 
” Plekhanov : “I suggest that the matter of the provisions for convening a congress is out of order, as having no bear-ing on the business in hand. 
”) It was Comrade Martov who brought the matter up, and we have not taken any decision to drop it. 
 Martov says theCouncil cannot convene a congress, and I say that it can. 
 The congress is convened by the Party Council on its own responsibility at any time—if possible not less than oncein two years. 
 Comrade Martov says that holding a congressis an ultima ratio . 
 Yes, it is, and the fruitlessness of our present debates goes to confirm it. 
 You will recall that Comrade Martov has himself admit-ted in principle that a body made up of people who have not been involved in our dissensions could play a useful partin bringing peace to the Party. 
 And since our own peace-making attempts have produced no results and even inliterature we are unlikely to keep to permissible forms ofpolemic, I maintain that only outside comrades can speak the decisive word. 
 We, the representatives of the Central Committee, disclaim all responsibility in respect of furtherattempts at reconciliation in the Party; we see no other honest way to end our dissensions than by appealing to the congress. 
 Now about Comrade Plekhanov’s remark as to the word “Marsh”. 
 ( Plekhanov : “I was replying to the question of Comrade Vasilyev, who applied the term to a section ofthe Party; I repeat, as chairman I cannot allow such expres-sions in the Party Council. 
”) I am admonished here that I saynothing about the abnormal and one-sided composition ofthe Central Committee; but what I am stating is the fact that there are two sides in the Party and that they are fight-ing with impermissible weapons. 
 On the present basis, anypositive work is quite impossible. 
 IX Before speaking on the substance of the matter, let me say in passing once again that no one ever takes offence at theword Sumpf . 
 * Then as to the negotiations with Travinsky. 
 My words have been interpreted here to mean that I deny that therewere negotiations with him. 
 Nothing of the sort. 
 I did not deny that negotiations took place, but merely pointed to the difference between the significance private negotiationscan have and that attaching to official ones. 
 I quoted herea letter by Comrade Travinsky himself as proof that if for-merly he viewed things as Comrade Plekhanov does, after-wards he altered his view. 
 That being the case, I would consider it quite out of place to raise the question of whom France will believe. 
 77 There is no need whatever to appeal to “France”. 
 Comrade Plekhanov declares that my peaceable “appeal” has had no effect even on myself. 
 I repeat, all I do in that“appeal” is express the desire that certain methods of strug-gle should not be used. 
 I call for peace. 
 People reply by attack-ing the Central Committee, and then wonder that I there-upon attack the Central Organ. 
 After the Central Committee has been attacked, I am accused of lack of peaceablenessfor hitting back! One has only to review our whole debatehere in the Council in order to see who led off by proposing peace on the basis of the status quo and who continued with *Marsh. 
— Ed. 
 war against the Central Committee. 
 It has been claimed that Lenin did nothing but tell the opposition: “Do what you’re told and don’t argue!...” That is not quite so. 
 All our September and October correspondence is evidence to thecontrary. 
 Let me remind you, for instance, that at the begin-ning of October, I was prepared (with Plekhanov) to co-opttwo to the editorial board. 
 Then, as regards the ultimatum,which I myself helped to draw up, I was willing at that time to cede you two seats on the Central Committee. 
 Next, I made another concession by resigning from the editorialboard, which I did so as not to stand in the way of othersjoining. 
 It will thus be seen that I did not only say “Dowhat you’re told and don’t argue”, but made concessionstoo. 
 Now to the actual matter in hand. 
 The attitude to my resolution strikes me as very strange. 
 For does that resolution accuse anyone, is it in the nature of an attack upon anyone?All it speaks of is whether such-and-such forms of struggleare permissible or not. 
 That there is a struggle is a fact, andthe idea is purely and solely to draw a line between permis-sible and impermissible forms of it. 
 And what I’m asking is: is that idea acceptable or not? Thus the expressions “instrument of struggle”, “attack on the minority”, etc. 
, inrelation to my resolution are quite out of place. 
 Possibly itsform is not very happy—I would not argue particularly aboutthat and would be prepared to modify the wording—but itsessence, which is that the contending sides in the Party must keep their struggle within definite permissible bounds—that is not open to question. 
 The kind of attitude the resolutionis encountering here seems to me one-sided, for one of thesides concerned rejects it because it purports to discern init some danger to itself. 
 ( Plekhanov : “I wish to offer a reminder that I have already pointed out several times that there are no two sides in this Council. 
”) To that I can say that I am referring to the two sides that exist in actual fact, not to any juridical division of the Council into two. 
 To ComradePlekhanov’s resolution, on the substance of which nothinghas been said here, the representatives of the editorial boardhave added nothing. 
 Yet I was waiting all the time for the one-sided character of that resolution to be modified. 
 7 SPEECHES ON CONVENING THE THIRD PARTY CONGRESS JANUARY 17 (30) I On the question of convening a congress there is little to add. 
 The Council debates too serve to illustrate the terribly difficult position in the Party. 
 The point has repeatedlybeen made that two nearly equal halves formed at the Con-gress, so that when one member of the “majority” dropped out,complete equality resulted. 
 I do not see how this equalitycould lead to peace without a Party congress. 
 No one doubts that the discord is giving rise to crying abnormalities. 
 A belligerent frame of mind exists on both sides ; that is an indubitable fact. 
 In the light of all this, no other honest andproper solution than convening a congress appears possible. 
Comrade Martov has spoken of the technical, financial, andother such difficulties of carrying out my proposal for a con-gress, but the present state of things is worse by far than all these difficulties. 
 II I cannot agree with Martov; he gives a wrong picture of the role of a congress. 
 He says the differences are not yet clear to all the comrades and that the convening of a congresswould arrest the process of demarcation and the airing of theorganisational conflict in the press. 
 I think that preciselywith a view to the free clarification of differences of principle it is necessary to eliminate the crisis, to clear the atmosphere of squabbles, and for that we need a congress. 
 Not in order to cut short the struggle, but to bring it within normal bounds, a Third Congress is required. 
 The very suggestion that it would cut short the struggle over principles is a strange one. 
 Let me remind you of the chairman’s statement at the Second Congress, to the effect that even our programme issubject to further development and elucidation. 
 But for thestruggle over principles, the conflict of opinion, to be effec-tive and fruitful, conditions are needed which at the momentwe do not have. 
 I protest against the historical parallels that have been drawn here and the reference to Rabocheye Dyelo . 
 The difference between the position now and three years agois that then we did not yet have a united party, and now wedo. 
 Those who talk here about a breakaway half should bethe last to protest against a congress to eliminate the abnor-mality which by our own efforts we find ourselves unable to remove. 
 Positive work and clarification of differences of principle will only be possible when the Third Congressremoves that abnormality and brings the conflict of opinionwithin definite bounds. 
 II Comrade Plekhanov’s clearly stated argument is a “force-ful” but false one. 
 If the Third Congress were to lead toa split, it would mean that people do not want to submit tomajority opinion, do not want to work together, that is, thatin reality we have no party. 
 Everyone has admitted that Comrade Travinsky’s attempts to settle the conflict were not without result; and there are many comrades like Travinsky,and the congress would be a gathering and colloquy amongjust such comrades. 
 A bitter struggle, a desperate struggle,even to the point of excesses, does not yet signify a split. 
If people really want to work together, they should also be willing to submit to the will of the majority, that is, of a congress. 
 8 SPEECHES ON THE PUBLICATION OF PARTY LITERATURE JANUARY 17 (30) I I shall begin from the end. 
 Comrade Martov has misun-derstood the Central Committee’s letters, particularly on thesubject of funds, and given a wrong interpretation of them. 
He leaves out of account that these letters were a sequel toa conversation which he, Martov, had with Travinsky. 
 Martovhimself wrote about the purport of that conversation in these terms: “To Comrade Travinsky, as to yourself, I mentioned 5,000-6,000 as the expected minimum of what could over a year be obtained for the Party from the two sources to which the members of the editorial board have access. 
” I muststate that Travinsky spoke of this being made available asa lump sum, not over the course of a year, so that there is some misunderstanding. 
 The fact is that we counted on these 5,000 and apportioned funds between the Russian and theforeign treasury accordingly. 
 Comrade Martov said that both the financial sources (incidentally, how greatly the editorial board in its irri-tation misrepresents the matter is evident from the fact that in letters to the Central Committee Martov actually used the word “moneybags” in quotation marks and blamed us for thisexpression, when in reality it was his own expression, notours)—I repeat, Comrade Martov said that both the financialsources were known to us. 
 Yes, they are known, but thepoint is not whether they are known, but whether they are accessible. 
 I know that one of these sources could provide up to 10,000 a year , the other up to 40,000, but that does not help, for to me they are inaccessible . 
 And it is their con-version from accessible into inaccessible sources that consti-tutes the cutting off of funds, which is an absolutely imper-missible method of waging the struggle in the Party. 
 There is also the fact of the recent arrests, involving people who were due to obtain money in Russia. 
 We haveno money here, getting any from Russia will be a longbusiness, and it will cost hundreds of rubles for the dispatch of special messengers. 
 Some money will be coming through eventually, of course, barring further mishaps, but notsoon, nor, in all likelihood, really enough. 
 That there were threats in the Central Committee’s letter is quite untrue. 
 There was no question of any threatening,for what the Central Committee was concerned for all along was the publication of the Central Organ. 
 The point about addresses Comrade Vasilyev will deal with. 
 According toour information, the editorial board is sending agents ofits own to Russia. 
 This implies a separate Central Organtreasury, which means a de facto split in the Party. 
 It is contrary to the Rules, which require that the Central Com-mittee should be kept fully informed and that all funds and all organisation of practical activities should be wholly concentrated in its hands. 
 The Central Organ is grosslyviolating the Rules by setting up its own centre of travellingagents, its own centre of practical leadership and interven-tion in the affairs of the committees. 
 The existence of these agents, contrary to the Party Rules, introduces direct disorganisation into the work. 
 The Central Committee can-not and will not be answerable for order in the conduct ofaffairs when disorder is systematically introduced by theCentral Organ itself. 
 Here are letters from Odessa and Bakuwhich illustrate how the matter stands. 
 The Odessa letter, of December 24, says: “We had a visit yesterday from Za-gorsky, 78 who announced that he had been delegated by the editorial board to inform the committees of the latestdevelopments, the negotiations, the present position in theeditorial board and the editors’ request to send in materialand contributions and to commission leaflets or suggest topics for leaflets of general interest, and also for pamphlets, to issue which a special group has been set up. 
 He repeatedall the old stuff and worked hard to prove the minority right, nobleminded and ‘loyal’. 
 The committee heard him out, then asked some questions, one of them being whether the Central Committee was informed of his mission; where-upon, instead of giving a straight yes or no, he proceededto exonerate himself and prove that the editorial board hadevery right to approach the committees without the CentralCommittee’s knowledge. 
 He insisted that his communica-tion should be discussed and a resolution drawn up there and then, in his presence; to which the committee replied that it took note of the communication, but that as todiscussing it and passing a resolution, it would do thatwhen it saw fit, while now it was going on to its regularbusiness. 
” 79 And here is what we read in a letter of January 1 from Baku: “The Baku Committee has received a visit from Martyn,80 who came with a communication from the Central Organ and with the undisguised object of sowingdistrust in the Central Committee. 
 When, at the end ofhis statement, he inquired as to the committee’s opinion,the answer he got was: The Central Committee has ourimplicit confidence. 
 And when he retorted that he would like to know their attitude to the Central Organ, he was told without any mincing of words that after what theyhad just heard (the statement of his mission) confidence inthe latter ‘had been shaken’. 
” 81 Equally improper and against the rules of secrecy is it that the Central Organ gives information on the composi-tion of the Central Committee not only to the committees, but to private individuals (as for instance to Druyan, asthe Central Committee pointed out in a letter to the CentralOrgan). 
 As to “waging war”, the fact is that Comrade Martovhere confuses two totally different things. 
 In the sphere ofpositive work and procuring funds any warfare (boycotts and the like) is most certainly impermissible, and the Central Committee has never engaged in any such thing. 
 In thesphere of literature, however, “war” is permissible, and noone has ever restricted the Central Organ’s polemics. 
 Youwill recall that even at a much earlier period the CentralCommittee expressed complete readiness to publish both Dan’s letter on the slogans of the opposition and Martov’s pamphlet Once More in the Minority , though both contain attacks upon itself. 
 The Central Committee has never once caused any delay in issuing the Central Organ’s publications. 
 Nor has there been a single case of the Central Committee improperly or unfairly distributing literature, of its “discriminating”against the minority committees. 
 On the contrary, Tra-vinsky has here testified and proved that the minoritycommittees were first of all generously supplied; ComradeMartov has had to admit that in this respect the Central Committee’s activities are above reproach. 
 As to refusing people Party literature, the matter stands as follows. 
 Every Party member without exception (if he inspires confidence asregards secrecy precautions, etc. 
) is given literature free t o transport to Russia and there hand over to the Central Com-mittee agents for distribution. 
 But when people have the hardihood to call themselves members of the Party and at the same time refuse to hand over literature to the CentralCommittee agents for general distribution, then naturallythe Central Committee cannot (and has not even the rightto) deal with such individuals. 
 And if these people after-wards buy up literature for their separate parochial enter-prises which disorganise the common work, so much the worse for them. 
 II I cannot for the life of me understand what is insolent about the distribution secretary’s first or second letter. 
82 He requests information which he needs for his accounts,and the editors, instead of giving a comradely answer to thepoint—which he never did get—engage in purely bureau-cratic quill-driving. 
 Now here is something that really isinsolent, in a letter by the editors of the Central Organ tothe Central Committee: “The editorial board of the Central Organ brings to the Central Committee’s attention that the presence abroad of three members of the Central Committee,which is not justified by any operational considerations andwhich implies the establishment of a new organisationalcentre not envisaged in the Party Rules, inevitably bringspolitical intrigue and disorganisation into Party life.... 
” This is outright vilification (intrigue) without a shadow of facts or evidence! The Central Committee’s reply to it was:“Had the editors not been acting in a state of utmost irri-tation, they would readily have seen the utter impropriety of their remarks about the number of Central Committee members present abroad. 
 The only reply of the Central Com-mittee’s foreign representative to this and other unseemlysallies by the editors (such as the comical allegation aboutthings being printed ‘in secret’) is to call on them to remem-ber their duty as Party members and desist from actionswhich out of a controversy in literature could create occa-sions for a split.... 
” 83 That even bourgeois publishers supposedly let editors have hundreds of copies I must confess I have not heard. 
 Let Comrade Martov try, if his are not just idle words, toask Dietz whether he gives Kautsky 400 copies of the Neue Zeit to distribute. 
 Or ask Singer, or Fischer, whether Grad-nauer demands 200 copies of the Vorwärts to distribute on his own. 
 The German Social-Democrats know the differencebetween anarchy and organisation. 
 The question of funds came up before the arrests—but then, I was only speaking of the difference the arrests hadmade to it. 
 How the editors confuse permissible controversy with impermissible boycott is especially vividly seen from thefollowing. 
 In their letter of January 4, replying to our inquiry about funds, they mention, as one of the “factors which make itdifficult for them to appeal to acquaintances for active support of the central treasury”, that “Central Committee agents and their protégés indulge at meetings in threateningtalk about the illegality of the present composition of theeditorial board (and the letter by Central Committee memberLenin talks about it too...). 
” Just look at this astoundingperversion of political values! The question of providing (or cutting off) sources of funds is tied up with that of con-troversy in speeches and pamphlets! What is that but mixingup ideological struggle with squabbling and contentionover posts?! The question of Party members approvingor disapproving the composition (and activities) of theeditorial board is jumbled with that of “legality”! What is that but bureaucratic formalism?! It is natural that the Central Committee’s foreign representative replied: “... As representative of the Central Committee, I think it necessary to point out to the editorial board that there is no reason to bring up the question of legality , etc. 
, because of heated utterances at forums of the membership abroad or a contro-versy conducted in literature.... 
 If in the controversy theeditors descry attacks on themselves, they have every oppor-tunity, after all, to reply to them. 
 Is it reasonable to getexcited over some sharp (in the editors’ view) thrust in con-troversy when there is no suggestion, even, of boycott or any other disloyal (in the Central Committee’s view) mode of action?” 84... To talk of “protégés” is nothing if not pecu-liar.... 
 What is it supposed to mean? What sort of bureau-cratic language is this? What has the Central Committeeto do with what people say at forums? We have no cen-sorship, that we should restrict freedom of speech and free-dom of controversy. 
 And does not this kind of struggle need to be marked off from boycotts? Comrade Martov’s story of the Odessa Committee having asked the Central Committee whether to send in letters tothe Central Organ I regard as, obviously, a joke. 
 No onecould seriously speak of such a thing. 
 I repeat, there has never been a single case of the Central Committee barring the minority from the work. 
 And Istress that Comrade Martov himself admits that he cancite no instances of improper, one-sided or biased distribu-tion of literature. 
 III Comrade Martov espies the danger of a coup on our part. 
 That is comical. 
 ( Martov : “What about the ultimatum?”) The Central Committee’s “ultimatum” was a reply to Staro-ver’s ultimatum. 
 85 The ultimatum is our last word on condi-tions for peace and good will that we could accept. 
 That is all. 
 Only a diseased imagination could discover schemes for a coup in our reply to the minority, who have, unques-tionably, brought the Party to the point of a split. 
 Themajority have no need to contemplate a coup. 
 As regards thedistribution of Iskra , all issues of the paper have, as far as possible, been distributed regularly, and had any committee deemed itself “forgotten” in this respect, it would only have needed to inform the Central Committee in a com-radely way. 
 We have up to the present received no such notifications. 
 And the editorial board’s letter to the com-mittees is not a comradely action, but an act of war. 
 The Central Committee is of the opinion that the work of literature distribution must be carried on from a singlesource and that a second distribution centre is unnecessaryand harmful. 
 Now a few words about the distribution secre-tary. 
 I repeat that he became a target for attack only becausehe wanted to do his job conscientiously and addressed a busi-ness inquiry to the editorial board. 
 And the editorial board’s peremptory answer—“Don’t dare talk!” “Send along 100 or200 copies!”, etc. 
—bears all the earmarks of a bureaucraticapproach in its purest form. 
 On the subject of addresses I shall only say that every-thing that belongs to the editorial board has been handed over to it. 
 Only personal and organisational correspondence has been sorted out, and all the rest turned over to the edi-tors. 
 I might also remind you that already in the Londondays the Organising Committee officially took all the or-ganisational correspondence into its own hands. 
 To speak of there being a new centre because some members of the Central Committee are here abroad is a patent quibble and bureaucratic meddling in matters which are the CentralCommittee’s independent concern. 
 IV Comrade Martov entirely misinterprets the Rules. 
 The Central Organ must have full information about everything—that is required both by the Rules and by the interestsof the work. 
 But the dispatch of representatives withorganisational objects—such as sending Z 86 to the Odessa Committee without the Central Committee’s knowledge— manifestly upsets the natural division of functions between the two central bodies of the Party. 
 It is quite unnecessaryfor purposes of information, and only introduces the plainestdisorganisation, completely disrupting unity of action. 
What this sort of move does is to aggravate the chaos inParty affairs, and in practice it means an outright splitting of the Party in two—instead of division of functions between the two central bodies. 
 TO THE PARTY Comrades! That our Party is going through a severe crisis is known by now to all, and has in fact been directly andopenly stated in our Central Organ also. 
 We consider it our duty to call on all members of the Party to take a conscious and active part in putting anend to the crisis as speedily and painlessly as possible. 
 Comrade Plekhanov, who at the Party Congress and— long after it—at the Congress of the League Abroad belongedto the Party Congress majority, now comes forward in No. 
 57 of Iskra as a champion of the demands of the minority, accusing the Central Committee of “eccentricity”, of anintransigence that only benefits our enemies, of refusing toco-opt minority adherents. 
 Such co-optation is, in ComradePlekhanov’s eyes, nothing less than “the only way to deliverour Party from its state of severe crisis, which sorely weak-ens our positions and strengthens those of our numerous enemies and opponents”. 
 One must be guided not only by theRules, says Comrade Plekhanov—in reference presumablyto this state of severe crisis—but also by the actual positionof affairs, by the existing relation of forces in the Party. 
One must rise above the circle and doctrinaire standpoint which pushes to the forefront what divides the workers instead of what unites them. 
 These general principles are undoubtedly correct, and it only remains for every Social-Democrat to acquaint him-self precisely with the facts and reflect seriously on theposition in order correctly to apply them. 
 Yes, we must without fail, at the cost of any and every effort, undaunted by the prospect of a long and arduousjob, cure our Party of the circle spirit, of faction and schism over trifles, of unseemly and unworthy wrangling over the conductor’s baton! Take a good look, then, at the events that have developed in our Party since its Second Congress. 
 Have the courage to expose our sores, in order to diagnosethem without hypocrisy or official humbug and to applythe right treatment. 
 The minutes of the Second Congress have now been pub-lished in their entirety; the minutes of the Congress of the League Abroad have likewise been made available to the Party membership. 
 Party literature has already laid baremany manifestations and symptoms of our crisis, andalthough much still remains to be done in that respect, acertain summing up already can and should be made. 
 The Second Congress ended with a bitter struggle over the composition of our central bodies. 
 By a majority of 24 to 20, a Central Organ editorial board of three was elected(Plekhanov, Martov and Lenin), and a Central Committeelikewise made up of three comrades. 
 Martov refused tofill the post he had been elected to, and he and all of theminority refused to take part in the elections to the Central Committee. 
 From the very time of the Congress the minority started a bitter fight against the central bodies, a regularwar over the conductor’s baton, a regular war of the circlespirit against the party spirit, a war to get the old editorialboard reinstated and a due (in the view of the minority)number of their adherents co-opted to the Central Com-mittee. 
 This war went on for months, and was accompanied by the minority’s total withdrawal from work under thedirection of the central bodies, by a boycott of them, and bypurely anarchistic preachings, specimens of which the Partymembership will find in profusion in the minutes of theLeague Congress. 
 The struggle chiefly centred abroad, among the section furthest removed from positive work and from the participation of class-conscious proletarians. 
 It involvedthe central bodies set up by the Second Congress in an appall-ing waste of energy on trips, meetings, and negotiationsintended to obviate countless petty dissatisfactions, dis-putes and squabbles. 
 That the demands of the opposition utterly disregarded the relation of forces whether at the Second Congress or in the Party as a whole may be seen, forexample, from the fact that while the editors of the Central Organ (Plekhanov and Lenin) actually agreed to the co-opta-tion of two—that is, to equal representation of the Party Congress majority and minority—the opposition demanded a huge majority (four to two) on the editorial board. 
 Underthe threat of an inevitable and immediate split, the twocentral bodies finally made a number of concessions to thedemands regarding the conductor’s baton: the editors wereco-opted, Lenin resigned from the editorial board and the Council, another majority member resigned from the Council likewise, the reorganisation of the League Abroad, whoseCongress had flouted everything the Party Congress haddecided, was allowed to lapse, and the opposition was offeredtwo seats on the Central Committee. 
 The opposition rejected this offer. 
 It evidently demands a larger number of seats, and for persons who would not be chosen by the Central Committee, but named by the oppo-sition. 
 Neither the relation of forces nor the interests of thework furnish the slightest justification for such demands:all that these ultimatums are backed by is threats of a splitand acts of grossly mechanical pressure, such as boycotts and withholding of funds. 
 The Party has been disorganised and demoralised to the utmost by this fight for posts, which diverts its forces frompositive work. 
 This demoralisation is not lessened but, ifanything, heightened by the fact that the minority’s so-called differences of principle lend this fight a false col-ouring. 
 We all agreed unanimously—and said so emphatically time and again—to recognise all decisions of the SecondCongress and all its elections as unconditionally binding. 
Now the minority has in practice repudiated the entire Rulesand all the elections; now those who uphold the common decisions are found to be “formalists”—those who received their powers from the Congress are labelled “bureaucrats”—those who take their stand by the vote of the majority,which (by our common consent) expressed the relation offorces in the Party, are accused of a grossly mechanicaland bureaucratic point of view. 
 Those who at the Congress, having been charged by the membership with the duty of electing the Party’s officials, transferred some editors to thestatus of contributors and some members of the Organising Committee to that of ordinary Party workers, are now found guilty of converting Party members into cogs and wheels, etc. 
, etc. 
 The unsound and unstable position the minority already adopted at the Party Congress led inevitably to thisdishonesty, which we are far from attributing to anyone’ssubjective will. 
 Is it not time to put an end to this strife and faction? Let everyone who cares about our Party’s future ask himself that. 
 Is it not time to make a determined end of this fight for control of the central bodies, of this contention over posts,which is having such a disruptive effect on all our work?Is it fitting to embark yet again, after months and monthsof negotiations, upon new negotiations with the opposition, or to raise the question of the Central Committee’s being one-sided or eccentric? For the raising of that question,after the co-optation of the editors had already seemed toensure peace, inevitably calls up again the question of theone-sidedness and eccentricity—the anti-Party nature,even—of our Central Organ. 
 How long are we going to engage in this indecent wrangling over the composition of the cen-tral bodies? And how can we settle the issue as to which sideis right in its demands? By what yardstick are we to measureit? Why is it the “firm-liners” that are to be counted intransi-gent, when they have ceded a very great deal of what theCongress decided, and not the “soft-liners”, who in practice have turned out uncommonly firm in their drive for a split and direct preparation of a split? Let the comrades consider how this abnormal position can be ended. 
 The Central Committee had hoped that thechange of cabinet at the Central Organ would bring peace. 
When the dispute had already gone very far, when the fight over the conductor’s baton had brought us to the very verge of a split—just one hope still remained: the achieve-ment of some sort of disengagement, so as not to interferewith each other, so as gradually, in the process of workingwithin one Party, to reduce the friction, so as not to touch,or to touch more seldom, on “sore” points. 
 The division of the central bodies, one would have thought, at least partially ensured the ending of the crisis: the minorityhad the Central Organ to itself and could freely group around it, freely advocate its views, freely carry on its Party work, without feeling “alien” in the Party. 
 And with the majority also controlling one of the central bodies—the Central Committee (or out numbering the minority upon it)—themajority too could feel at least some satisfaction. 
 The fightover the central bodies could have ended and given placeto a purely ideological clearing up of disagreements andshades of opinion. 
 This hope is shattered by Iskra ’s raising the question of co-optation to the Central Committee. 
 We do not deem itpossible to engage anew in this bargaining over posts, whichfills us with repugnance. 
 We should actually prefer, failingany other solution, to hand over all the conductor’s batons to the minority, if it positively cannot bring itself to work in the Party except in the top posts. 
 Our readiness to do so increases as this ugly new malady of our movement dragson—as these petty squabbles, the more unbearable for beingpetty, become chronic. 
 But we should first wish to know with all possible certainty the opinion of the Party, to consult revolutionary public opinion, especially within Russia. 
 We invite comrades closely to examine and study the facts relating to our “crisis”,to make a thorough appraisal of the present position in theParty, and to state their views on all the questions raised. 
 Written in the early part of February 1904 First published in 1929 Published according in Lenin Miscellany X to the manuscript CIRCUMSTANCES OF RESIGNATION THE ISKRA EDITORIAL BOARD Geneva, February 20, 1904 Dear Comrades, As your pamphlet touches on the circumstances which induced me to resign from the Iskra editorial board, I would request you to find space in the Appendix for this reply ofmine to Comrade Plekhanov’s letter of January 29, 1904, toComrade Martov, published in Martov’s pamphlet on com-bating the “state of siege”. 
 Comrade Plekhanov finds that the statement of the case in my letter to the editors is inaccurate . 
 However, he has not made, nor could he have made, a single correction of fact . 
 He has merely supplemented my account with an inaccurate version of private conversations I had with him. 
 Generally speaking, to quote private conversations is, I consider, a sure sign that serious arguments are lacking. 
 I still hold the opinion so recently held by Comrade Ple-khanov in reference to Comrade Martov’s accounts of privateconversations (League Minutes, p. 
 134), namely, that it isscarcely possible for such conversations to be “reproducedaccurately”, and that “controversy” regarding them “ leads nowhere ”. 
 But since Comrade Plekhanov does cite our private conversations, I consider myself entitled to explain them andamplify, particularly as these conversations took place inthe presence of third persons. 
 The first conversation, in which Comrade Plekhanov said that he had decided * to resign if I absolutely refused to *In his zeal for accuracy Comrade Plekhanov overdoes it a little when he says: Plekhanov had no right to decide on co-optation, agree to co-optation, took place on the evening of the day the League Congress ended and the following morning, in the presence of two members of the Party Council. 
 The con-versation revolved around concessions to the opposition. 
Plekhanov insisted that concessions were essential, for hefelt certain that the opposition would not obey any decisionof the Party Council and that a complete split of the Partymight take place at any moment. 
 I insisted that, after what had happened at the League, after the measures taken at its Congress by the representative of the Central Committee(each of which Comrade Plekhanov had taken part in dis-cussing and had fully approved), it was impossible to yieldto anarchistic individualism, and that the formation ofa separate writers’ group (which I had repeatedly declared in conversation with Plekhanov, and contrary to his own opinion, to be quite permissible) need not necessarily implya split. 
 When the upshot of the conversation was that oneof us would have to resign, I at once said that I would do so,not wishing to hamper Plekhanov in his attempts to settlethe conflict and avoid what he considered would be a split. 
 Comrade Plekhanov is so amiable towards me now as to find no other motive for my action than the most cowardlyevasiveness. 
 In order to paint this characteristic of minein the liveliest colours, Comrade Plekhanov quotes me assaying: “Everybody will say that Lenin must be wrong ifeven Plekhanov disagrees with him. 
” That is laying the colours on thick, no doubt about it! So thick, in fact, that, all unnoticed by Comrade Plekhanov,the result is a patent absurdity. 
 If I had been convinced that“everybody” would consider Plekhanov right (as he modestlythinks to himself), and had thought it necessary to reckonwith the opinion of this everybody, then, obviously, I would never have ventured to disagree with Plekhanov, I would have followed him in this instance too. 
 In his desire to pre-sent my conduct in the most unprepossessing light andascribe it to the most ignominious motives, he fathers on me f or according to the Rules co-optation has to be unanimous. 
 This is not a correction, but a quibble, for what the Rules forbid in the absence of unanimity is definite organisational actions , and not decisions — which some people are all too prone to adopt for appearances’ sake,without following them up with action. 
 a motive devoid of all sense . 
 I am supposed to have been so afraid of disagreeing with Plekhanov in anything that— I did disagree with him. 
 It doesn’t hold water, this argu-ment of Comrade Plekhanov’s. 
 Actually, my idea was that it would be better for me to resign, for otherwise my dissenting opinion would hamperPlekhanov’s attempts to secure peace. 
 I did not want to ham-per those attempts—perhaps we might in fact agree on peace terms—but I considered it impossible to assume responsi-bility for an editorial board on which an émigré circle im-posed candidates in this way . 
 A few days later I did go with a certain Council member to see Plekhanov, and our talk took the following course: “You know,” said Plekhanov, “there are some wives who are so quarrelsome that it’s best to give way to them in order to avoid hysterics and an unsavoury row in public. 
” “Perhaps so,” I replied, “but in giving way you must take care to leave yourself strong enough to prevent an evenbigger ‘row’. 
” “Well, but by resigning you surrender everything,” said Plekhanov. 
 “Not always,” I rejoined, and cited the case of Cham-berlain. 
 My idea was one I have also expressed in print:should Plekhanov succeed in securing a peace acceptable tothe majority, in whose ranks he had fought so long and sovigorously, then I would not start war either; if he should not succeed, I reserved to myself freedom of action, so as to denounce the “quarrelsome wife” if even Plekhanov could not calm and pacify her. 
 It was during this conversation that I told Plekhanov (who did not yet know the opposition’s terms) of my “deci-sion” to join the Central Committee (I could “decide” to do so, but of course all the members of the Central Committee would have to give their consent). 
 Plekhanov was entirelysympathetic to this plan, as a last attempt to find some sortof mode of living with the “quarrelsome wife”. 
 When, in aletter to Plekhanov on November 6, 1903, I expressed theopinion that perhaps he was simply going to hand over the editorial board to the Martovites, he replied (on Novem-ber 8): “... You seem to have a wrong idea of my intentions. 
 I explained them again yesterday to Comrade Vasilyev” (the Central Committee member who had attended the League Congress). 
 Writing to this same Comrade Vasilyev on November 10 about whether to expedite or delay the 52nd issue of Iskra , containing a statement about the Congress, Plekhanov said: “...Publishing anything about the Congressmeans either 1) announcing that Martov and the others arenot taking part in Iskra , or 2) refusing this request of Mar-tov’s—in which case he will announce it himself in a special leaflet. 
 In either case it would bring the split to the knowl-edge of the public, and that is exactly what we have to avoid just now ” (my italics—N. 
 L. 
). 
 On November 17, Plekhanov wrote to the same comrade: “... What would you say to the immediate co-optation of Martov and the others? I ambeginning to think that this would be the way to settle the matter with the least difficulty. 
 I do not want to act without you...” (Plekhanov’s italics). 
 These quotations show clearly that Plekhanov was trying to act in agreement with the majority, and wanted to co-optthe editors solely for the sake of peace and on the conditionof peace, and not for the purpose of war against the majority. 
 If it has worked out the other way, that only goes to show that the cart of anarchistic individualism had got rollingtoo recklessly in the tactics of boycott and disruption;the strongest brakes could not hold it back. 
 That is a greatpity, of course, and Plekhanov, who sincerely wanted peace,has landed in an unpleasant position; but that is no reason for putting all the blame on me. 
 As to Plekhanov’s statement that I was willing to keep quiet in return for a suitable “equivalent”, and his prouddeclaration, “I did not see fit to purchase his silence”, thispolemical trick only makes a comical impression when com-pared with the words I have just quoted from his letter of November 10. 
 It was Plekhanov who attached the utmost importance to silence, to keeping the split from the knowl-edge of the public. 
 * What more natural than that I should *A propos , it was Plekhanov who was so insistent about with-holding publication of the League Minutes and the concluding part of the Party Congress Minutes—the part where he says that he takes upon himself full moral responsibility for a direct vote against theold so-called editorial board, and expresses the hope that the Party has not grown poor in literary forces—a statement which one member of the minority called a pompous phrase in pseudo-classical style. 
 tell him I agreed to that too, provided there was peace? This talk about “equivalents” and “purchases” leads one to expect that next time Plekhanov will inform the public that Lenin is forging currency for transactions of this kind. 
That sort of thing has happened, after all, in our émigréquarrels—and the present atmosphere is conducive to it. 
 Comrade Plekhanov’s letter involuntarily leads one to wonder whether he is not now having to purchase the right to be in the minority. 
 The tactics of the minority in our so-called Party organ are already quite clear. 
 What they aretrying to do is obscure the controversial issues and thefacts which really led to our divergence. 
 They are trying toshow that Martynov was far closer to Iskra than Lenin— just how, where and to what extent the muddled editors of the new Iskra will be a long time endeavouring to explain. 
 They hypocritically condemn dragging personalities into thecontroversy, while actually their whole struggle is one bigcampaign against an individual, in which they do not evenhesitate to ascribe to the “enemy” pernicious qualities of themost incompatible kind—from the crassest pig-headedness to the most cowardly evasiveness. 
 Anything to make it good and strong. 
 And those new allies, Comrades Plekhanovand Martov, make it so good and strong that they will soonbe no whit behind the famous Bundists with their famousepithet—“scum”. 
 They are bombarding me so fiercely fromtheir battleships that I am beginning to wonder whether this is not a conspiracy of two-thirds of the dreadful trio. 
 Ought I not to pose as injured too? Ought I not to cry outabout a “state of siege”? That is sometimes so convenientand so useful, you know.... 
 To be sure, to become a true minority man Comrade Plekhanov has still, I would say, to take two little steps: first, to avow that the formulation of Paragraph 1 of the Rules advocated by Comrades Martov and Axelrod at theCongress (and so zealously hushed up by them now) consti-tutes, not a step towards opportunism, not a surrender to bourgeois individualism, but the germ of new, truly Social-Democratic, Akimov-Martov and Martynov-Axelrod orga-nisational views; and, secondly, to avow that the strugglewith the minority since the Congress has not been a struggleagainst gross violations of Party discipline, against methods of agitation that only arouse disgust, not a struggle against anarchism and anarchistic phraseology (see pp. 
 17, 96, 97, 98, 101, 102, 104, etc. 
, etc. 
, of the League Minutes), but a struggle against a “state of siege”, bureaucracy, formalism,and so forth. 
 I shall deal at length with controversial issues of this kind in a pamphlet I am now preparing for the press. 
 Meanwhile... meanwhile let us scan the gallery of Gogol types opened in the columns of our leading organ, which is making a prac-tice of presenting its readers with conundrums.

 Lenin Published in the pamphlet Published according Commentary on the Minutes of to the pamphlet text the Second Congress of the League of Russian Revolutionary Social-Democracy Abroad , Geneva, 1904 MAY DAY Comrade workers! May Day is coming, the day when the workers of all lands celebrate their awakening to a class-conscious life, their solidarity in the struggle against all coercion and oppression of man by man, the struggle to free the toiling millions from hunger, poverty, and humiliation. 
Two worlds stand facing each other in this great struggle:the world of capital and the world of labour, the world ofexploitation and slavery and the world of brotherhood andfreedom. 
 On one side stand the handful of rich blood-suckers. 
 They have seized the factories and mills, the tools and machinery,have turned millions of acres of land and mountains ofmoney into their private property. 
 They have made thegovernment and the army their servants, faithful watchdogsof the wealth they have amassed. 
 On the other side stand the millions of the disinherited. 
 They are forced to beg the moneybags for permission to workfor them. 
 By their labour they create all wealth; yet alltheir lives long they have to struggle for a crust of bread,beg for work as for charity, sap their strength and health byback-breaking toil, and starve in hovels in the villages or in the cellars and garrets of the big cities. 
 But now these disinherited toilers have declared war on the moneybags and exploiters. 
 The workers of all landsare fighting to free labour from wage slavery, from povertyand want. 
 They are fighting for a system of society wherethe wealth created by the common labour will go to benefit, not a handful of rich men, but all those who work. 
 They want to make the land and the factories, mills, and machinesthe common property of all toilers. 
 They want to do away with the division into rich and poor, want the fruits of labour to go to the labourers themselves, and all the achieve-ments of the human mind, all improvements in ways of working, to improve the lot of the man who works, andnot serve as a means of oppressing him. 
 The great struggle of labour against capital has cost the workers of all countries immense sacrifices. 
 They have shedrivers of blood in behalf of their right to a better life and real freedom. 
 Those who fight for the workers’ cause are subjected by the governments to untold persecution. 
 Butin spite of all persecution the solidarity of the workers ofthe world is growing and gaining in strength. 
 The workersare uniting more and more closely in socialist parties, thesupporters of those parties are mounting into millions and are advancing steadily, step by step, towards complete victory over the class of capitalist exploiters. 
 The Russian proletariat, too, has awakened to a new life. 
 It too has joined this great struggle. 
 Gone are the days whenour worker slaved submissively, seeing no escape from hisstate of bondage, no glimmer of light in his bitter life. 
 Socialism has shown him the way out, and thousands upon thousands of fighters have thronged to the red banner, asto a guiding star. 
 Strikes have shown the workers the powerof unity, have taught them to fight back, have shown howformidable to capital organised labour can be. 
 The workershave seen that it is off their labour that the capitalists and the government live and get fat. 
 The workers have been fired with the spirit of united struggle, with the aspirationfor freedom and for socialism. 
 The workers have realisedwhat a dark and evil force the tsarist autocracy is. 
 The work-ers need freedom for their struggle, but the tsarist govern-ment binds them hand and foot. 
 The workers need freedom of assembly, freedom to organise, freedom for newspapers and books, but the tsarist government crushes, with knout,prison and bayonet, every striving for freedom. 
 The cry“Down with the autocracy!” has swept through the lengthand breadth of Russia, it has been sounded more and moreoften in the streets, at great mass meetings of the workers. 
 Last summer tens of thousands of workers throughout the South of Russia rose up to fight for a better life, for freedomfrom police tyranny. 
 The bourgeoisie and government trem-bled at the sight of the formidable army of workers, which at one stroke brought to a standstill the entire industrial life of huge cities. 
 Dozens of fighters for the workers’ cause fell beneath the bullets of the troops that tsarism sent againstthe internal enemy. 
 But there is no force that can vanquish this internal enemy, for the ruling classes and the government only live by itslabour. 
 There is no force on earth that could break the millions of workers, who are growing more and more class-conscious, more and more united and organised. 
 Everydefeat the workers sustain brings new fighters into theranks, it awakens broader masses to new life and makesthem prepare for fresh struggles. 
 And the events Russia is now passing through are such that this awakening of the worker masses is bound to be even more rapid and widespread, and we must strain every nerveto unite the ranks of the proletariat and prepare it for evenmore determined struggle. 
 The war is making even the mostbackward sections of the proletariat take an interest in polit-ical affairs and problems. 
 The war is showing up ever more clearly and vividly the utter rottenness of the autocratic order, the utter criminality of the police and court gangthat is ruling Russia. 
 Our people are perishing from wantand starvation at home—yet they have been dragged intoa ruinous and senseless war for alien territories lying thou-sands of miles away and inhabited by foreign races. 
 Our people are ground down in political slavery—yet they have been dragged into a war for the enslavement of other peoples. 
Our people demand a change of political order at home—but it is sought to divert their attention by the thunder ofguns at the other end of the world. 
 But the tsarist govern-ment has gone too far in its gamble, in its criminal squan-dering of the nation’s wealth and young manhood, sent to die on the shores of the Pacific. 
 Every war puts a strain onthe people, and the difficult war against cultured and freeJapan is a frightful strain upon Russia. 
 And this straincomes at a time when the structure of police despotism hasalready begun to totter under the blows of the awakening proletariat. 
 The war is laying bare all the weak spots of the government, the war is tearing off all false disguises, thewar is revealing all the inner rottenness; the war is making the preposterousness of the tsarist autocracy obvious to all and is showing everyone the death-agony of the old Russia, the Russia where the people are disfranchised, ignorant and cowed, the Russia that is still in serf bondage to the policegovernment. 
 The old Russia is dying. 
 A free Russia is coming to take its place. 
 The dark forces that guarded the tsarist autocracyare going under. 
 But only the class-conscious and organised proletariat can deal them their death-blow. 
 Only the class-conscious and organised proletariat can win real, not sham,freedom for the people. 
 Only the class-conscious and orga-nised proletariat can thwart every attempt to deceive thepeople, to curtail their rights, to make them a mere tool inthe hands of the bourgeoisie. 
 Comrade workers! Let us then prepare with redoubled energy for the decisive battle that is at hand! Let the ranksof the Social-Democrat proletarians close ever firmer! Lettheir word spread ever farther afield! Let campaigningfor the workers’ demands be carried on ever more boldly!Let the celebration of May Day win thousands of new fight-ers to our cause and swell our forces in the great struggle for the freedom of all the people, for the liberation of allwho toil from the yoke of capital! Long live the eight-hour day!Long live international revolutionary Social-Democracy!Down with the criminal and plundering tsarist autocracy!

 Twelve Years , 1907Written in February-May 1904 Published in book form in Geneva, May 1904 PREFACE When a prolonged, stubborn and heated struggle is in progress, there usually begin to emerge after a time thecentral and fundamental points at issue, upon the decision of which the ultimate outcome of the campaign depends, and in comparison with which all the minor and pettyepisodes of the struggle recede more and more into thebackground. 
 That, too, is how matters stand in the struggle within our Party, which for six months now has been riveting the attention of all members of the Party. 
 And precisely because in the present outline of the whole struggle I havehad to refer to many details which are of infinitesimalinterest, and to many squabbles which at bottom are of nointerest whatever, I should like from the very outset to drawthe reader’s attention to two really central and fundamental points, points which are of tremendous interest, of undoubt-ed historical significance, and which are the most urgentpolitical questions confronting our Party today. 
 The first question is that of the political significance of the division of our Party into “majority” and “minority”which took shape at the Second Party Congress and pushed all previous divisions among Russian Social-Democrats far into the background. 
 The second question is that of the significance in principle of the new Iskra ’s position on organisational questions, insofar as this position is really based on principle. 
 The first question concerns the starting-point of the struggle in our Party, its source, its causes, and its funda-mental political character. 
 The second question concerns theultimate outcome of the struggle, its finale, the sum-total of principles that results from adding up all that pertains to the realm of principle and subtracting all that pertains to the realm of squabbling. 
 The answer to the first question is obtained by analysing the struggle at the Party Congress;the answer to the second, by analysing what is new in theprinciples of the new Iskra . 
 Both these analyses, which make up nine-tenths of my pamphlet, lead to the conclu-sion that the “majority” is the revolutionary, and the “mi-nority” the opportunist wing of our Party; the disagreements that divide the two wings at the present time for the mostpart concern, not questions of programme or tactics, but onlyorganisational questions; the new system of views thatemerges the more clearly in the new Iskra the more it tries to lend profundity to its position, and the more that position becomes cleared of squabbles about co-optation, is opportun-ism in matters of organisation. 
 The principal shortcoming of the existing literature on the crisis in our Party is, as far as the study and eluci-dation of facts is concerned, the almost complete absenceof an analysis of the minutes of the Party Congress; and as far as the elucidation of fundamental principles of organisa-tion is concerned, the failure to analyse the connectionwhich unquestionably exists between the basic error com-mitted by Comrade Martov and Comrade Axelrod in theirformulation of Paragraph 1 of the Rules and their defence ofthat formulation, on the one hand, and the whole “system” (insofar as one can speak here of a system) of Iskra ’s present principles of organisation, on the other. 
 The present editorsof Iskra apparently do not even notice this connection, although the importance of the controversy over Paragraph 1has been referred to again and again in the literature of the“majority”. 
 As a matter of fact, Comrade Axelrod and Com-rade Martov are now only deepening, developing and extend-ing their initial error with regard to Paragraph 1. 
 As amatter of fact, the entire position of the opportunists inorganisational questions already began to be revealed in thecontroversy over Paragraph 1: their advocacy of a diffuse,not strongly welded, Party organisation; their hostility to the idea (the “bureaucratic” idea) of building the Party from the top downwards, starting from the Party Congress andthe bodies set up by it; their tendency to proceed from the bottom upwards, allowing every professor, every high-school student and “every striker” to declare himself a mem-ber of the Party; their hostility to the “formalism” which demands that a Party member should belong to one of theorganisations recognised by the Party; their leaning towardsthe mentality of the bourgeois intellectual, who is onlyprepared to “accept organisational relations platonically”;their penchant for opportunist profundity and for anarchis-tic phrases; their tendency towards autonomism as against centralism—in a word, all that is now blossoming so lux-uriantly in the new Iskra , and is helping more and more to reveal fully and graphically the initial error. 
 As for the minutes of the Party Congress, the truly unde-served neglect of them can only be explained by the fact that our controversies have been cluttered by squabbles, and possibly by the fact that these minutes contain too largean amount of too unpalatable truth. 
 The minutes of the PartyCongress present a picture of the actual state of affairs inour Party that is unique of its kind and unparalleled forits accuracy, completeness, comprehensiveness, richness and authenticity; a picture of views, sentiments and plans drawn by the participants in the movement themselves; a pictureof the political shades existing in the Party, showing theirrelative strength, their mutual relations and their struggles. 
It is the minutes of the Party Congress, and they alone,that show us how far we have really succeeded in making a clean sweep of the survivals of the old, purely circle ties and substituting for them a single great party tie. 
 It is theduty of every Party member who wishes to take an intelli-gent share in the affairs of his Party to make a careful studyof our Party Congress. 
 I say study advisedly, for merely toread the mass of raw material contained in the minutes is not enough to obtain a picture of the Congress. 
 Only by careful and independent study can one reach (as one should)a stage where the brief digests of the speeches, the dryextracts from the debates, the petty skirmishes over minor(seemingly minor) issues will combine to form one whole,enabling the Party member to conjure up the living figure of each prominent speaker and to obtain a full idea of the political complexion of each group of delegates to the PartyCongress. 
 If the writer of these lines only succeeds in stimulat-ing the reader to make a broad and independent study of the minutes of the Party Congress, he will feel that his work was not done in vain. 
 One more word to the opponents of Social-Democracy They gloat and grimace over our disputes; they will, ofcourse, try to pick isolated passages from my pamphlet,which deals with the failings and shortcomings of our Party,and to use them for their own ends. 
 The Russian Social-Democrats are already steeled enough in battle not to be perturbed by these pinpricks and to continue, in spite ofthem, their work of self-criticism and ruthless exposureof their own shortcomings, which will unquestionably andinevitably be overcome as the working-class movementgrows. 
 As for our opponents, let them try to give us a picture of the true state of affairs in their own “parties” even remote-ly approximating that given by the minutes of our SecondCongress! N. 
 Lenin May 1904 A. 
 THE PREPARATIONS FOR THE CONGRESS There is a saying that everyone is entitled to curse his judges for twenty-four hours. 
 Our Party Congress, likeany congress of any party, was also the judge of certain persons, who laid claim to the position of leaders but who met with discomfiture. 
 Today these representatives of the“minority” are, with a naïveté verging on the pathetic,“cursing their judges” and doing their best to discredit theCongress, to belittle its importance and authority. 
 This striv-ing has been expressed most vividly, perhaps, in an article in Iskra , No. 
 57, by “Practical Worker”, 89 who feels out-raged at the idea of the Congress being a sovereign “divinity”. 
This is so characteristic a trait of the new Iskra that it cannot be passed over in silence. 
 The editors, the majorityof whom were rejected by the Congress, continue, on the one hand, to call themselves a “Party” editorial board, while, on the other, they accept with open arms people who declare that the Congress was not divine. 
 Charming, is it not? Tobe sure, gentlemen, the Congress was not divine; but whatmust we think of people who begin to “blackguard” theCongress after they have met with defeat at it? For indeed, let us recall the main facts in the history of the preparations for the Congress. 
 Iskra declared at the very outset, in its announcement of publication in 1900, that before we could unite, lines ofdemarcation must be drawn. 
 Iskra endeavoured to make the Conference of 1902” 90 a private meeting and not a Party Congress. 
 * Iskra acted with extreme caution in the summer and autumn of 1902 when it re-established the Organising *See Minutes of the Second Congress, p. 
 20. 
 Committee elected at that conference. 
 At last the work of demarcation was finished—as we all acknowledged. 
 The Organising Committee was constituted at the very end of 1902. 
 Iskra welcomed its firm establishment, and in an editorial article in its 32nd issue declared that the convoca-tion of a Party Congress was a most urgent and pressing necessity. 
 * Thus, the last thing we can be accused of is hav-ing been hasty in convening the Second Congress. 
 We were, in fact, guided by the maxim: measure your cloth seven times before you cut it; and we had every moral right toexpect that after the cloth had been cut our comrades wouldnot start complaining and measuring it all overagain. 
 The Organising Committee drew up very precise (forma-listic and bureaucratic, those would say who are now using these words to cover up their political spinelessness) Regula-tions for the Second Congress, got them passed by all thecommittees, and finally endorsed them, stipulating amongother things, in Point 18, that “all decisions of the Con-gress and all the elections it carries out are decisions of the Party and binding on all Party organisations. 
 They can-not be challenged by anyone on any pretext whatever andcan be rescinded or amended only by the next Party Con-gress”. 
 ** How innocent in themselves, are they not, are these words, accepted at the time without a murmur, as somethingaxiomatic; yet how strange they sound today—like a verdict against the “minority”! Why was this point included? Merely as a formality? Of course not. 
 This provision seemednecessary, and was indeed necessary, because the Party con-sisted of a number of isolated and independent groups,which might refuse to recognise the Congress. 
 This provi-sion in fact expressed the free will of all the revolutionaries (which is now being talked about so much, and so irrele-vantly, the term “free” being euphemistically applied towhat really deserves the epithet “capricious”). 
 It was equiva-lent to a word of honour mutually pledged by all the Russian Social-Democrats. 
 It was intended to guarantee that allthe tremendous effort, danger and expense entailed by the *See present edition, Vol. 
 6, p.

 22-23 and 380. 
 Congress should not be in vain, that the Congress should not be turned into a farce. 
 It in advance qualified any refus-al to recognise the decisions and elections at the Congress as a breach of faith . 
 Who is it, then, that the new Iskra is scoffing at when it makes the new discovery that the Congress was not divineand its decisions are not sacrosanct? Does that discoveryimply “new views on organisation”, or only new attempts to cover up old tracks? B. 
 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE VARIOUS GROUPINGS AT THE CONGRESS Thus, the Congress was called after the most careful prep-aration and on the basis of the fullest representation. 
 The general recognition that its composition was correct and itsdecisions absolutely binding found expression also in the statement of the chairman (Minutes, p. 
 54) after the Congresshad been constituted. 
 What was the principal task of the Congress? To create a real party on the basis of the principles and organisational ideas that had been advanced and elaborated by Iskra . 
 That this was the direction in which the Congress had towork was predetermined by the three years’ activities ofIskra and by the recognition of the latter by the majority of the committees. 
 Iskra ’s programme and trend were to become the programme and trend of the Party; Iskra ’s organisational plans were to be embodied in the Rules ofOrganisation of the Party. 
 But it goes without saying thatthis could not be achieved without a struggle: since theCongress was so highly representative, the participantsincluded organisations which had vigorously fought Iskra (the Bund and Rabocheye Dyelo ) and organisations which, while verbally recognising Iskra as the leading organ, actual-ly pursued plans of their own and were unstable in mattersof principle (the Yuzhny Rabochy group and delegates from some of the committees who were closely associated withit). 
 Under these circumstances, the Congress could not but become an arena of struggle for the victory of the “Iskra ” trend . 
 That it did become such an arena will at once be apparent to all who peruse its minutes with any degree of attention. 
 Our task now is to trace in detail the principal groupings revealed at the Congress on various issues and to reconstruct, on the basis of the precise data of the minutes, the political complexion of each of the main groups. 
 Whatprecisely were these groups, trends and shades which, at theCongress, were to unite under the guidance of Iskra into a single party?—that is what we must show by analysingthe debates and the voting. 
 The elucidation of this is of cardinal importance both for a study of what our Social-Democrats really are and for an understanding of the causesof the divergence among them. 
 That is why, in my speechat the League Congress and in my letter to the editors of thenew Iskra , I gave prime place to an analysis of the various groupings. 
 My opponents of the “minority” (headed by Mar-tov) utterly failed to grasp the substance of the question. 
 At the League Congress they confined themselves to correc-tions of detail, trying to “vindicate” themselves from thecharge of having swung towards opportunism, but not evenattempting to counter my picture of the groupings at theCongress by drawing any different one . 
 Now Martov tries in Iskra (No. 
 56) to represent every attempt clearly to delimit the various political groups at the Congress as mere “circlepolitics”. 
 Strong language, Comrade Martov! But thestrong language of the new Iskra has this peculiar quality: one has only to reproduce all the stages of our divergence,from the Congress onwards, for all this strong language to turn completely and primarily against the present editorial board. 
 Take a look at yourselves, you so-called Party editorswho talk about circle politics! Martov now finds the facts of our struggle at the Congress so unpleasant that he tries to slur over them altogether. 
“An Iskra -ist,” he says, “is one who, at the Party Congress and prior to it, expressed his complete solidarity with Iskra , advocated its programme and its views on organisation andsupported its organisational policy. 
 There were over fortysuch Iskra -ists at the Congress—that was the number of votes cast for Iskra ’s programme and for the resolution adopt-ing Iskra as the Central Organ of the Party. 
” Open the Con-gress Minutes, and you will find that the programme was adopted by the votes of all (p. 
 233) except Akimov, who abstained. 
 Thus, Comrade Martov wants to assure us that /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR the Bundists, and Brouckère, and Martynov demonstrated their “complete solidarity” with Iskra and advocated its views on organisation! This is ridiculous. 
 The fact that after the Congress all who took part became equal members of the Party (and not even all, for the Bundists had withdrawn) ishere jumbled with the question of the grouping that evokedthe struggle at the Congress. 
 Instead of a study of the ele-ments that went to make up the “majority” and the “minority” after the Congress, we get the official phrase, “recognised the programme”! Take the voting on the adoption of Iskra as the Central Organ. 
 You will see that it was Martynov—whom ComradeMartov, with a courage worthy of a better cause, now creditswith having advocated Iskra ’s organisational views and organisational policy—who insisted on separating the two parts of the resolution: the bare adoption of Iskra as the Central Organ, and the recognition of its services. 
 When thefirst part of the resolution (recognising the services of Iskra , expressing solidarity with it) was put to the vote, only thirty-five votes were cast in favour; there were two votes against (Akimov and Brouckère) and eleven abstentions (Martynov, the five Bundists and the five votes of the editorial board:the two votes each of Martov and myself and Plekhanov’sone). 
 Consequently, the anti-Iskra group (five Bundists and three Rabocheye Dyelo -ists) is quite apparent in this instance also, one most advantageous to Martov’s present views and chosen by himself. 
 Take the voting on the second part of the resolution—adopting Iskra as the Central Organ without any statement of motives or expression of solidarity (Min-utes, p. 
 147): forty-four votes in favour , which the Martov of today classes as Iskra -ist. 
 The total number of votes to be cast was fifty-one; subtracting the five votes of the editors, who abstained, we get forty-six; two voted against (Akimov and Brouckère); consequently, the remaining forty-fourinclude all five Bundist . 
 And so, the Bundists at the Con-gress “expressed complete solidarity with Iskra ”—this is how official history is written by the official Iskra ! Running ahead somewhat, we will explain to the reader the real reasons for this official truth: the present editorial board of Iskra could and would have been a real Party editorial board (and not a quasi-Party one, as it is today) if the Bundists and the “Rabocheye Dyelo ”-ists had not withdrawn from the Con-gress ; that is why these trusty guardians of the present, so-called Party editorial board had to be proclaimed Iskra -ists. 
 But I shall speak of this in greater detail later. 
 The next question is: if the Congress was a struggle between the Iskra -ist and the anti-Iskra -ist elements, were there no intermediate, unstable elements who vacillatedbetween the two? Anyone at all familiar with our Party and with the picture generally presented by congresses of every kind will be inclined a priori to answer the question in the affirmative. 
 Comrade Martov is now very reluctant to recallthese unstable elements, so he represents the Yuzhny Rabochy group and the delegates who gravitated towards it as typicalIskra -ists, and our differences with them as paltry and unim-portant. 
 Fortunately, we now have before us the complete text of the minutes and are able to answer the question—aquestion of fact, of course—on the basis of documentaryevidence. 
 What we said above about the general groupingat the Congress does not, of course, claim to answer thequestion, but only to present it correctly. 
 Without an analysis of the political groupings, without having a picture of the Congress as a struggle between def-inite shades, the divergence between us cannot be under-stood at all. 
 Martov’s attempt to gloss over the differentshades by ranking even the Bundists with the Iskra -ists is simply an evasion of the question. 
 Even a priori , on the basis of the history of the Russian Social-Democratic move-ment before the Congress, three main groups are to be noted(for subsequent verification and detailed study): the Iskra -ists, the anti-Iskra -ists, and the unstable, vacillating, wavering elements. 
 C. 
 BEGINNING OF THE CONGRESS. 
 THE ORGANISING COMMITTEE INCIDENT The most convenient way to analyse the debates and the voting is to take them in the order of the Congress sittings,so as successively to note the political shades as they became more and more apparent. 
 Only when absolutely necessary will departures from the chronological order be made forthe purpose of considering together closely allied questions or similar groupings. 
 For the sake of impartiality, we shall endeavour to mention all the more important votes, omit-ting, of course, the innumerable votes on minor issues, which took up an inordinate amount of time at our Congress (owingpartly to our inexperience and inefficiency in dividing thematerial between the commissions and the plenary sittings,and partly to quibbling which bordered on obstruction). 
 The first question to evoke a debate which began to reveal differences of shades was whether first place should be given (on the Congress “order of business”) to the item: “Positionof the Bund in the Party” (Minutes, pp. 
 29-33). 
 From thestandpoint of the Iskra -ists, which was advocated by Ple-khanov, Martov, Trotsky, and myself, there could be no doubton this score. 
 The Bund’s withdrawal from the Party strik-ingly bore out our view: if the Bund refused to go our way and accept the principles of organisation which the majorityof the Party shared with Iskra , it was useless and senseless to “make believe” that we were going the same way and onlydrag out the Congress (as the Bundists did drag it out). 
The matter had already been fully clarified in our literature, and it was apparent to any at all thoughtful Party member that all that remained was to put the question frankly,and bluntly and honestly make the choice: autonomy (inwhich case we go the same way), or federation (in which caseour ways part). 
 Evasive in their entire policy, the Bundists wanted to be evasive here too and postpone the matter. 
 They were joined by Comrade Akimov, who, evidently on behalf ofall the followers of Rabocheye Dyelo , at once brought up the differences with Iskra over questions of organisation (Min-utes, p. 
 31). 
 The Bund and Rabocheye Dyelo were supported by Comrade Makhov (representing the two votes of the Nikolayev Committee—which shortly before had expressed its solidarity with Iskra !). 
 To Comrade Makhov the matter was altogether unclear, and another “sore spot”, he consid-ered, was “the question of a democratic system or, on thecontrary [mark this!], centralism”—exactly like the ma-jority of our present “Party” editorial board, who at the Congress had not yet noticed this “sore spot”! Thus the Iskra -ists were opposed by the Bund, Rabo-cheye Dyelo and Comrade Makhov, who together controlled the ten votes which were cast against us (p. 
 33). 
 Thirty votes were cast in favour —this is the figure, as we shall see later, around which the votes of the Iskra -ists often fluctuat-ed. 
 Eleven abstained, apparently not taking the side ofeither of the contending “parties”. 
 It is interesting to notethat when we took the vote on Paragraph 2 of the Rules ofthe Bund (it was the rejection of this Paragraph 2 thatcaused the Bund to withdraw from the Party), the votes in favour of it and the abstentions also amounted to ten (Min-utes, p. 
 289), the abstainers being the three Rabocheye Dyelo -ists (Brouckère, Martynov, and Akimov) and ComradeMakhov. 
 Clearly, the grouping in the vote on the place of the Bund item on the agenda was not fortuitous . 
 Clearly, all these comrades differed with Iskra not only on the technical question of the order of discussion, but in essence as well . 
 In the case of Rabocheye Dyelo , this difference in essence is clear to everyone, while Comrade Makhov gave an inimitabledescription of his attitude in the speech he made on the with-drawal of the Bund (Minutes, pp. 
 289-90). 
 It is worth whiledwelling on this speech. 
 Comrade Makhov said that after the resolution rejecting federation, “the position of the Bund in the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 ceased to be for me a question of principleand became a question of practical politics in relation toan historically evolved national organisation”. 
 “Here,” thespeaker continued, “I could not but take into account allthe consequences that might follow from our vote, and would therefore have voted for Paragraph 2 in its entirety. 
” Com-rade Makhov has admirably imbibed the spirit of “practicalpolitics”: in principle he had already rejected federation, and therefore in practice he would have voted for including in the Rules a point that signified federation! And this“practical” comrade explained his profound position of principle in the following words: “But [the famous Shchedrin “but”!] since my voting one way or the other would onlyhave significance in principle [!!] and could not be of anypractical importance, in view of the almost unanimous voteof all the other Congress delegates, I preferred to abstain inorder to bring out in principle [God preserve us from such principles!] the difference between my position on this question and the position of the Bund delegates, who votedin favour. 
 Conversely, I would have voted in favour if the Bund delegates had abstained, as they had at first insisted. 
” Can you make head or tail of it? A man of principle abstains from loudly saying “Yes” because practically it is useless when everybody else says “No”. 
 After the vote on the place of the Bund item on the agenda, the question of the Borba group cropped up at theCongress; it too led to an extremely interesting grouping andwas closely bound up with the “sorest” point at the Congress, namely, the personal composition of the central bodies. 
 The committee appointed to determine the composition of theCongress pronounced against inviting the Borba group, inaccordance with a twice-adopted decision of the Organising Committee (see Minutes, pp. 
 383 and 375) and the report ofthe latter ’s representatives on this committee (p. 
 35). 
 Thereupon Comrade Egorov, a member of the Organising Committee , declared that “the question of Borba” (mark, of Borba, not of some particular member of it) was “new tohim”, and demanded an adjournment. 
 How a question onwhich the Organising Committee had twice taken a deci-sion could be new to a member of the Organising Committee remains a mystery. 
 During the adjournment the Organising Committee held a meeting (Minutes, p. 
 40), attended bysuch of its members as happened to be at the Congress (sev-eral members of the Organising Committee, old membersof the Iskra organisation, were not at the Congress). 
 * Then began a debate about Borba. 
 The Rabocheye Dyelo -ists spoke in favour (Martynov, Akimov, and Brouckère—pp. 
 36-38), the Iskra -ists (Pavlovich, Sorokin, Lange,92 Trotsky, Martov, and others)—against. 
 Again the Congress split upinto the grouping with which we are already familiar. 
 Thestruggle over Borba was a stubborn one, and Comrade Martovmade a very circumstantial (p. 
 38) and “militant” speech, in which he rightly referred to “inequality of representation” of the groups in Russia and abroad, and said that it wouldhardly be “well” to allow a foreign group any “privilege”(golden words, particularly edifying today, in the light ofthe events since the Congress!), and that we should not *Concerning this meeting, see the “Letter” of Pavlovich,91 w h o was A member of the Organising Committee and who before the Con-gress was unanimously elected as the editorial board’s trusted repre-sentative, its seventh member (League Minutes, p. 
 44. 
). 
 encourage “the organisational chaos in the Party that was characterised by a disunity not justified by any considera-tions of principle” (one right in the eye for ... the “minority” at our Party Congress!). 
 Except for the followers of Rabo-cheye Dyelo , nobody came out openly and with reasoned mo-tives in favour of Borba until the list of speakers was closed(p. 
 40). 
 It should be said in fairness to Comrade Akimov andhis friends that they at least did not wriggle and hide, but frankly advocated their line, frankly said what they wanted. 
 After the list of speakers had been closed, when it was already out of order to speak on the issue itself , Comrade Ego-rov “insistently demanded that a decision just adopted bythe Organising Committee be heard”. 
 It is not surprisingthat the delegates were outraged at this manoeuvre, and Comrade Plekhanov, the chairman, expressed his “astonish-ment that Comrade Egorov should insist upon his demand”. 
One thing or the other, one would think: either take an openand definite stand before the whole Congress on the questionat issue, or say nothing at all. 
 But to allow the list of speakersto be closed and then, under the guise of a “reply to the debate”, confront the Congress with a new decision of the Organising Committee on the very subject that had beenunder discussion, was like a stab in the back! When the sitting was resumed after dinner, the Bureau, still in perplexity, decided to waive “formalities” and resortto the last method, adopted at congresses only in extreme cases, viz. 
, “comradely explanation”. 
 The spokesman of the Organising Committee, Popov, announced the commit-tee’s decision, which had been adopted by all its membersagainst one, Pavlovich (p. 
 43), and which recommended theCongress to invite Ryazanov. 
 Pavlovich declared that he had challenged and continued to challenge the lawfulness of the Organising Committee meeting, and that the Committee’s new decision “ contradicts its earlier decision ”. 
 This statement caused an uproar. 
 Com-rade Egorov, also an Organising Committee member and amember of the Yuzhny Rabochy group, evaded answering on the actual point in question and tried to make the central issue one of discipline. 
 He claimed that Comrade Pavlovich had violated Party discipline (1), for, having heard hisprotest, the Organising Committee had decided “not to lay Pavlovich’s dissenting opinion before the Congress”. 
 The debate shifted to the question of Party discipline, and Ple-khanov, amid the loud applause of the delegates, explained for the edification of Comrade Egorov that “ we have no such thing as binding instructions ” (p. 
 42; cf. 
 p. 
 379, Regulations for the Congress, Point 7: “The powers of delegates mustnot be restricted by binding instructions. 
 In the exerciseof their powers, delegates are absolutely free and indepen-dent”). 
 “The Congress is the supreme Party authority”, and, consequently, he violates Party discipline and the Con-gress Regulations who in any way restricts any delegate intaking directly to the Congress any question of Party life whatsoever. 
 The issue thus came down to this: circlesor a party? Were the rights of delegates to be restricted at the Congress in the name of the imaginary rights or rules of the various bodies and circles, or were all lower bodies and old groups to be completely , and not nomi-nally but actually, disbanded in face of the Congress, pendingthe creation of genuinely Party official institutions? Thereader will already see from this how profoundly important from the standpoint of principle was this dispute at the very outset (the third sitting) of this Congress whose purpose wasthe actual restoration of the Party. 
 Focused in this dispute,as it were, was the conflict between the old circles and smallgroups (such as Yuzhny Rabochy ) and the renascent Party. 
 And the anti-Iskra groups at once revealed themselves: the Bundist Abramson, Comrade Martynov, that ardent ally of the present Iskra editorial board, and our friend Comrade Makhov all sided with Egorov and the Yuzhny Rabochy group against Pavlovich. 
 Comrade Martynov, who now vies with Martov and Axelrod in sporting “de-mocracy” in organisation, even cited the example of ... the army, where an appeal to a superior authority can only be made through a lower one!! The true meaning of this “com-pact” anti-Iskra opposition was quite clear to everyone who was present at the Congress or who had carefully followed theinternal history of our Party prior to the Congress. 
 It wasthe purpose of the opposition (perhaps not always realised by all of its representatives, and sometimes pursued by force of inertia) to guard the independence, individualism andparochial interests of the small, petty groups from being swallowed up in the broad Party that was being built on the Iskra principles. 
 It was precisely from this angle that the question was approached by Comrade Martov, who had not yet joinedforces with Martynov. 
 Comrade Martov vigorously took thefield, and rightly so, against those whose “notion of Partydiscipline does not go beyond a revolutionary’s duty to theparticular group of a lower order to which he belongs”. 
 “No compulsory [Martov’s italics] grouping can be tolerated within a united Party,” he explained to the champions ofthe circle mentality, not foreseeing what a flail these wordswould be for his own political conduct at the end of the Con-gress and after.... 
 A compulsory grouping cannot be toler-ated in the case of the Organising Committee, but can quite well be tolerated in the case of the editorial board. 
 Martov condemns a compulsory grouping when he looks at it fromthe centre, but Martov defends it the moment he finds him-self dissatisfied with the composition of the centre.... 
 It is interesting to note that in his speech Comrade Martov laid particular stress not only on Comrade Egorov’s “pro-found error”, but also on the political instability the Orga-nising Committee had displayed. 
 “A recommendation hasbeen submitted on behalf of the Organising Committee,”he exclaimed in just indignation, “which runs counter t o the committee report [based, we will add, on the report ofmembers of the Organising Committee—p. 
 43, Koltsov’s remarks] and to the Organising Committee ’s own earlier recom-mendations . 
” (My italics. 
) As we see, at that time , before his “swing-over”, Martov clearly realised that substituting Rya-zanov for Borba in no way removed the utter contradictori-ness and inconsistency of the Organising Committee’sactions (Party members may learn from the League Congress Minutes, p. 
 57, how Martov conceived the matter after his swing-over). 
 Martov did not confine himself then to analys-ing the issue of discipline; he bluntly asked the OrganisingCommittee: “What new circumstance has arisen to necessi-tate the change ?” (My italics. 
) And, indeed, when the Organ-ising Committee made its recommendation, it did not even have the courage to defend its opinion openly, as Akimov and the others did. 
 Martov denies this (League Minutes,p. 
 56), but whoever reads the minutes of the Congress will see that he is mistaken. 
 Popov, in submitting the Organising Committee recommendation, did not say a word about the motives (Party Congress Minutes, p. 
 41). 
 Egorov shifted the issue to one of discipline, and all he said on the questionitself was: “The Organising Committee may have had newreasons [but whether it did, and what those new reasons were,is unknown]; it could have forgotten to nominate somebody,and so on. 
 [This “and so on” was the speaker’s sole refuge, for the Organising Committee could not have forgotten about Borba, which it had discussed twice before the Congress andonce in the committee. 
] The Organising Committee did notadopt this decision not because it had changed its attitudetowards the Borba group, but because it wants to removeunnecessary rocks in the path of the Party’s future central organisation at the very outset of its activities. 
” This is not a reason, but an evasion of a reason. 
 Every sincere So-cial-Democrat (and we do not entertain the least doubt aboutthe sincerity of any Congress delegate) is concerned toremove what he considers to be sunken rocks, and to remove them by those methods which he considers advisable. 
 Giving reasons means explicitly stating and explaining one’s view of things, and not making shift with truisms. 
 And theycould not give a reason without “changing their attitude towards Borba”, because in its earlier and contrary decisionsthe Organising Committee had also been concerned to re-move sunken rocks, but it had then regarded the very oppo-site as “rocks”. 
 And Comrade Martov very severely and very rightly attacked this argument, saying that it was “ petty ” and inspired by a wish to “ burke the issue ”, and advising the Organising Committee “ not to be afraid of what people will say”. 
 These words characterise perfectly the essential nature of the political shade which played so large a part at the Congress and which is distinguished precisely by its want of independence, its pettiness, its lack of a line of its own, itsfear of what people will say, its constant vacillation betweenthe two definite sides, its fear of plainly stating its credo — in a word, by all the features of a “Marsh”. 
 * *There are people in our Party today who are horrified when they hear this word, and raise an outcry about uncomradely methods ofcontroversy. 
 A strange perversion of sensibility due to ... a misapplied sense of official form! There is scarcely a political party acquainted A consequence of this political spinelessness of the un-stable group was, incidentally, that no one except the Bund-ist Yudin (p. 
 53) did put before the Congress a resolution to invite one of the members of the Borba group. 
 Yudin’s res-olution received five votes—all Bundists, apparently: thevacillating elements had changed sides again! How largewas the vote of the middle group is shown approximatelyby the voting on the resolutions of Koltsov and Yudin on this question: the Iskra -ist received thirty-two votes (p. 
 47), the Bundist received sixteen, that is, in addition to the eightanti-Iskra -ist votes, the two votes of Comrade Makhov (cf. 
 p. 
 46), the four votes of the members of the Yuzhny Rabochy group, and two others. 
 We shall show in a moment that this alignment can by no means be regarded as acciden-tal; but first let us briefly note Martov’s present opinion of this Organising Committee incident. 
 Martov maintained atthe League that “Pavlovich and others fanned passions”. 
One has only to consult the Congress Minutes to see that thelongest, most heated and sharpest speeches against Borbaand the Organising Committee were delivered by Martov himself. 
 By trying to lay the “blame” on Pavlovich he only demonstrates his own instability: it was Pavlovich he helpedto elect prior to the Congress as the seventh member ofthe editorial board; at the Congress he fully associated him-self with Pavlovich (p. 
 44) against Egorov; but afterwards,having suffered defeat at the hands of Pavlovich, he began to accuse him of “fanning passions”. 
 This is ludicrous. 
 Martov waxes ironical in Iskra (No. 
 56) over the importance that was attached to whether X or Y should be invited. 
But again the irony turns against Martov, for it was thisOrganising Committee incident that started the dispute oversuch an “important” question as inviting X or Y on to the Central Committee or the Central Organ. 
 It is unseemly to measure with two different yardsticks, depending on whetherthe matter concerns your own “group of a lower order” with internal struggles that has managed to do without this term, by which the unstable elements who vacillate between the contending sideshave always been designated. 
 Even the Germans, who know how tokeep their internal struggles within very definite bounds indeed, arenot offended by the word versumpft (sunk in the marsh— Ed. 
), are not horrified, and do not display ridiculous official prudery. 
 (relative to the Party) or someone else ’s. 
 This is precisely a philistine and circle, not a Party attitude. 
 A simple compari-son of Martov’s speech at the League (p. 
 57) with his speech at the Congress (p. 
 44) sufficiently demonstrates this. 
 “I can-not understand,” Martov said, inter alia , at the League, “how people can insist on calling themselves Iskra -ists and at the same time be ashamed of being Iskra -ists. 
” A strange failure to understand the difference between “calling oneself” and “being”—between word and deed. 
 Martov himself, at the Congress, called himself an opponent of compulsory groupings, yet, after the Congress, came to be a supporter of them.... 
 D. 
 DISSOLUTION OF THE YUZHNY RABOCHY GROUP The alignment of the delegates over the Organising Com-mittee question may perhaps seem accidental. 
 But suchan opinion would be wrong, and in order to dispel it weshall depart from the chronological order and at onceexamine an incident which occurred at the end of the Congress,but which was very closely connected with the one just discussed. 
 This incident was the dissolution of the Yuzhny Rabochy group. 
 The organisational trend of Iskra —com-plete amalgamation of the Party forces and removal of thechaos dividing them—came into conflict here with theinterests of one of the groups, which had done useful work when there was no real party, but which had become super-fluous now that the work was being centralised. 
 From the standpoint of circle interests, the Yuzhny Rabochy group was entitled no less than the old Iskra editorial board to lay claim to “continuity” and inviolability. 
 But in theinterests of the Party, it was its duty to submit to the trans-fer of its forces to “the appropriate Party organisations” (p. 
 313, end of resolution adopted by the Congress). 
 From the standpoint of circle interests and “philistinism”, thedissolution of a useful group, which no more desired it thandid the old Iskra editorial board, could not but seem a “tick-lish matter” (the expression used by Comrade Rusov andComrade Deutsch). 
 But from the standpoint of the inter-ests of the Party, its dissolution, its “assimilation” in the Party (Gusev’s expression), was essential. 
 The Yuzhny Rabochy group bluntly declared that it “did not deem it necessary” to proclaim itself dissolved and demanded that “the Congress definitely pronounce its opinion”, and pronounce it “immediately: yes or no”. 
 The Yuzhny Rabochy group openly invoked the same “continuity” as the old Iskra editorial board began to invoke ... after it was dissolved!“Although we are all individually members of one Party,”Comrade Egorov said, “it nevertheless consists of a num-ber of organisations, with which we have to reckon as historical entities .... 
 If such an organisation is not detri-mental to the Party , there is no need to dissolve it . 
” Thus an important question of principle was quite def-initely raised, and all the Iskra -ists—inasmuch as their own circle interests had not yet come to the forefront—tooka decisive stand against the unstable elements (the Bund-ists and two of the Rabocheye Dyelo -ists had already with-drawn from the Congress; they would undoubtedly have beenheart and soul in favour of “reckoning with historicalentities”). 
 The result of the vote was thirty-one for , five against and five abstentions (the four votes of the membersof the Yuzhny Rabochy group and one other, that of Byelov, most likely, judging by his earlier pronouncements, p. 
 308). 
 A group of ten votes distinctly opposed to Iskra ’s consistent organisational plan and defending the circle spirit as againstthe party spirit can be quite definitely discerned here. 
During the debate the Iskra -ists presented the question pre-cisely from the standpoint of principle (see Lange’s speech, p. 
 315), opposing parochial amateurishness and disunity, refusing to pay heed to the “sympathies” of individualorganisations, and plainly declaring that “if the comrades ofYuzhny Rabochy had adhered more strictly to principle earlier, a year or two ago, the unity of the Party and thetriumph of the programme principles we have sanctioned here would have been achieved sooner” . 
 Orlov, Gusev, Lyadov, Muravyov, Rusov, Paylovich, Glebov, and Gorin allspoke in this strain. 
 And far from protesting against thesedefinite and repeated references made at the Congress tothe lack of principle in the policy and “line” of Yuzhny Rabochy , of Makhov and of others, far from making any reser-vation on this score, the Iskra -ists of the “minority”, in the person of Deutsch, vigorously associated themselves withthese views, condemned “chaos”, and welcomed the “blunt way the question was put” (p. 
 315) by that very same Com-rade Rusov who, at this same sitting , had the audacity—oh, horror!—to “bluntly put” the question of the old editorial board too on a purely Party basis (p. 
 325). 
 On the part of the Yuzhny Rabochy group the proposal to dissolve it evoked violent indignation, traces of which are tobe found in the minutes (it should not be forgotten that theminutes offer only a pale reflection of the debates, for they do not give the full speeches, but only very condensed summa-ries and extracts). 
 Comrade Egorov even described as a “lie”the bare mention of the Rabochaya Mysl group 93 alongside of Yuzhny Rabochy —a characteristic sample of the attitude that prevailed at the Congress towards consistent Economism. 
Even much later, at the 37th sitting, Egorov spoke of the dissolution of Yuzhny Rabochy with the utmost irritation (p. 
 356), requesting to have it recorded in the minutes thatduring the discussion on Yuzhny Rabochy the members of the group had not been asked either about publicationfunds or about control by the Central Organ and the CentralCommittee. 
 Comrade Popov hinted, during the debate on Yuzhny Rabochy , at a compact majority having predeter-mined the fate of the group. 
 “ Now ,” he said (p. 
 316), “ after the speeches of Comrades Gusev and Orlov , everything is clear . 
” The meaning of these words is unmistakable: now, afterthe Iskra -ists had stated their opinion and moved a resolu-tion, everything was clear, i. 
e. 
, it was clear that Yuzhny Rabochy would be dissolved, against its own wishes. 
 Here the Yuzhny Rabochy spokesman himself drew a distinction between the Iskra -ists (and, moreover, Iskra -ists like Gusev and Orlov) and his own supporters, as representingdifferent “lines” of organisational policy. 
 And when thepresent-day Iskra represents the Yuzhny Rabochy group (and Makhov too, most likely?) as “typical Iskra -ists”, it only demonstrates that the new editorial board has forgotten themost important (from this group’s standpoint) events ofthe Congress and is anxious to cover up the evidence show-ing what elements went to form what is known as the“minority”. 
 Unfortunately, the question of a popular periodical was not discussed at the Congress. 
 It was very actively discussedby all the Iskra -ists both before the Congress and during the Congress itself, outside the sittings, and they agreed that it would be highly irrational at this moment in the Party’s life to launch such a publication or convert any of the existing ones for the purpose. 
 The anti-Iskra -ists ex-pressed the opposite opinion at the Congress; so did theYuzhny Rabochy group in their report; and the fact that a motion to this effect, with ten signatures, was not tabledcan only be attributed to chance, or to a disinclination to raise a “hopeless” issue. 
 E. 
 THE EQUALITY OF LANGUAGES INCIDENT Let us return to the chronological order of the Congress sittings. 
 We have now convincingly seen that even before the Congress proceeded to discuss its actual business, therewas clearly revealed not only a perfectly definite groupof anti-Iskra -ists (eight votes), but also a group of interme-diate and unstable elements prepared to support the eightanti-Iskra -ists and increase their votes to roughly sixteen or eighteen. 
 The question of the position of the Bund in the Party, which was discussed at the Congress in extreme, excessivedetail, reduced itself to deciding about the principle, whileits practical decision was postponed until the discussionon organisation. 
 Since the points involved had been given quite a lot of space in the press prior to the Congress, the discussion at the Congress produced relatively little thatwas new. 
 It must, however, be mentioned that the supportersof Rabocheye Dyelo (Martynov, Akimov, and Brouckère), while agreeing with Martov’s resolution, made the res-ervation that they found it inadequate and disagreed with the conclusions drawn from it (pp. 
 69, 73, 83 and 86). 
 After discussing the position of the Bund, the Congress passed on to the programme. 
 This discussion centred mainlyaround amendments of detail which present but slightinterest. 
 The opposition of the anti-Iskra -ists on matters of principle found expression only in Comrade Martynov’s onslaught on the famous presentation of the question of spon-taneity and consciousness. 
 Martynov was, of course, backedby the Bundists and Rabocheye Dyelo -ists to a man. 
 The un-soundness of his objections was pointed out, among others, by Martov and Plekhanov. 
 It should be noted as a curiosity that the Iskra editorial board (on second thoughts, appar-ently) have now gone over to Martynov’s side and aresaying the opposite of what they said at the Congress!Presumably, this is in accordance with the celebrated prin-ciple of “continuity”.... 
 It only remains for us to wait untilthe editorial board have thoroughly cleared up the question and explain to us just how far they agree with Martynov, on what points exactly, and since when. 
 Meanwhile, weonly ask: has anyone ever seen a party organ whose editorial board said after a congress the very opposite of what theyhad said at the congress? Passing over the arguments about the adoption of Iskra as the Central Organ (we dealt with that above) and the beginning of the debate on the Rules (which it will be moreconvenient to examine in connection with the whole discus-sion of the Rules), let us consider the shades of principlerevealed during the discussion of the programme. 
 Firstof all let us note one detail of a highly characteristic nature, namely, the debate on proportional representation. 
 Comrade Egorov of Yuzhny Rabochy advocated the inclusion of this point in the programme, and did so in a way that calledforth the justified remark from Posadovsky (an Iskra -ist of the minority) that there was a “serious difference of opin-ion”. 
 “There can be no doubt,” said Comrade Posadovsky, “that we do not agree on the following fundamental ques-tion: should we subordinate our future policy to certain fun-damental democratic principles and attribute absolute valueto them , or should all democratic principles be exclusively subordinated to the interests of our Party? I am decidedlyin favour of the latter. 
” Plekhanov “fully associated himself” with Posadovsky, objecting in even more definite and em-phatic terms to “the absolute value of democratic principles”and to regarding them “abstractly”. 
 “Hypothetically,” hesaid, “a case is conceivable where we Social-Democratswould oppose universal suffrage. 
 There was a time when thebourgeoisie of the Italian republics deprived members of the nobility of political rights. 
 The revolutionary proletar-iat may restrict the political rights of the upper classesin the same way as the upper classes used to restrict its polit-ical rights. 
” Plekhanov’s speech was greeted with applause and hissing , and when Plekhanov protested against some-body’s Zwischenruf ,* “You should not hiss,” and told the com-rades not to restrain their demonstrations, Comrade Egorovgot up and said: “Since such speeches call forth applause,I am obliged to hiss. 
” Together with Comrade Goldblatt (aBund delegate), Comrade Egorov challenged the views ofPosadovsky and Plekhanov. 
 Unfortunately, the debate was closed, and this question that had cropped up in it immedi-ately vanished from the scene. 
 But it is useless for ComradeMartov to attempt now to belittle or even altogether denyits significance by saying at the League Congress: “Thesewords [Plekhanov’s] aroused the indignation of some ofthe delegates; this could easily have been avoided if Comrade Plekhanov had added that it was of course impossible to imagine so tragic a situation as that the proletariat, in or-der to consolidate its victory, should have to trample onsuch political rights as freedom of the press.... 
 ( Plekhanov : ‘Merci . 
’)” (League Minutes, p. 
 58. 
) This interpretation directly contradicts Comrade Posadovsky’s categorical state-ment at the Congress about a “serious difference of opinion” and disagreement on a “fundamental question”. 
 On this fun-damental question, all the Iskra -ists at the Congress opposed the spokesmen of the anti-Iskra “Right” (Goldblatt) and of the Congress “Centre” (Egorov). 
 This is a fact, and one maysafely assert that if the “Centre” (I hope this word will shock the “official” supporters of mildness less than any other...) had had occasion to speak “ without restraint ” (through the mouth of Comrade Egorov or Makhov) on thisor on analogous questions, the serious difference of opinionwould have been revealed at once. 
 It was revealed even more distinctly over the matter of “equality of languages” (Minutes, p. 
 171 et seq. 
). 
 On this point it was not so much the debate that was so eloquent,but the voting: counting up the times a vote was taken, weget the incredible number of sixteen ! Over what? Over whether it was enough to stipulate in the programme theequality of all citizens irrespective of sex, etc. 
, and language , or whether it was necessary to stipulate “freedom of lan-*Interjection from the floor.

 guage”, or “equality of languages”. 
 Comrade Martov charac-terised this episode fairly accurately at the League Congress when he said that “a trifling dispute over the formulation of one point of the programme became a matter of principlebecause half the Congress was prepared to overthrow theProgramme Committee”. 
 Precisely. 
 * The immediate cause of the conflict was indeed trifling, yet it did become a mat-ter of principle and consequently assumed terribly bitter forms, even to the point of attempts to “ overthrow ” the Programme Committee, of suspecting people of a desire to“mislead the Congress ” (as Egorov suspected Martov!), and of personal remarks of the most ... abusive kind (p. 
 178). 
Even Comrade Popov “expressed regret that mere trifleshad given rise to such an atmosphere ” (my italics, p. 
 182) as prevailed during the course of three sittings (the 16th, 17th and 18th). 
 All these expressions very definitely and categorically point to the extremely important fact that the atmosphereof “suspicion” and of the most bitter farms of conflict (“over-throwing”)—for which later, at the League Congress, the Iskra -ist majority were held responsible!—actually arose long before we split into a majority and minority . 
 I repeat, this is a fact of enormous importance, a fundamental fact,and failure to understand it leads a great many people tovery thoughtless conclusions about the majority at the endof the Congress having been artificial. 
 From the present *Martov added: “On this occasion much harm was done by Ple-khanov’s witticism about asses. 
” (When the question of freedom of language was being discussed, a Bundist, I think it was, mentionedstud farms among other institutions, whereupon Plekhanov said ina loud undertone: “Horses don’t talk, but asses sometimes do. 
”) Icannot, of course, see anything particularly mild, accommodating,tactful or flexible about this witticism. 
 But I find it strange that Mar-tov, who admitted that the dispute became a matter of principle , made absolutely no attempt to analyse what this principle was and whatshades of opinion found expression here, but confined himself totalking about the “harmfulness” of witticisms. 
 This is indeed a bureau-cratic and formalistic attitude! It is true that “much harm was doneat the Congress” by cutting witticisms, levelled not only at the Bund-ists, but also at those whom the Bundists sometimes supported and even saved from defeat. 
 However, once you admit that the incidentinvolved principles, you cannot confine yourself to phrases about the“impermissibility” (League Minutes, p. 
 58) of certain witticisms. 
 point of view of Comrade Martov, who asserts that nine-tenths of the Congress delegates were Iskra -ists, the fact that “mere trifles”, a “trivial” cause, could give rise to a conflict which became a “matter of principle” and nearlyled to the overthrow of a Congress commission is absolutelyinexplicable and absurd. 
 It would be ridiculous to evade thisfact with lamentations and regrets about “harmful” witti-cisms. 
 No cutting witticisms could have made the conflict a matter of principle ; it could become that only because of the character of the political groupings at the Congress. 
It was not cutting remarks and witticisms that gave riseto the conflict—they were only a symptom of the fact that the Congress political grouping itself harboured a “contradic-tion”, that it harboured all the makings of a conflict, that it harboured an internal heterogeneity which burst forth with immanent force at the least cause, even the most trifling . 
 On the other hand, from the point of view from which I regard the Congress, and which I deem it my duty to up-hold as a definite political interpretation of the events,even though this interpretation may seem offensive to some— from this point of view the desperately acute conflict of principle that arose from a “trifling” cause is quite expli-cable and inevitable. 
 Since a struggle between the Iskra -ists and the anti-Iskra -ists went on all the time at our Congress, since between them stood unstable elements, and since thelatter, together with the anti-Iskra -ists, controlled one-third of the votes (8 # 10=18, out of 51, according to my calcu-lation, an approximate one, of course), it is perfectly clearand natural that any falling away from the “Iskra ”-ists of even a small minority created the possibility of a victory for the anti-Iskra trend and therefore evoked a “frenzied” strug-gle. 
 This was not the result of improper cutting remarks and attacks, but of the political combination. 
 It was not cutting remarks that gave rise to the political conflict; it was theexistence of a political conflict in the very grouping at theCongress that gave rise to cutting remarks and attacks—this contrast expresses the cardinal disagreement in principlebetween Martov and myself in appraising the political sig-nificance of the Congress and its results. 
 In all, there were during the Congress three major cases of a small number of Iskra -ists falling away from the major-ity—over the equality of languages question, over Para-graph 1 of the Rules, and over the elections—and in all three cases a fierce struggle ensued, finally leading to the severe crisis we have in the Party today. 
 For a politicalunderstanding of this crisis and this struggle, we must notconfine ourselves to phrases about the impermissibility ofwitticisms, but must examine the political grouping of theshades that clashed at the Congress. 
 The “equality of lan-guages” incident is therefore doubly interesting as far as ascertaining the causes of the divergence is concerned, forhere Martov was (still was!) an Iskra -ist and fought the anti-Iskra -ists and the “Centre” harder perhaps than anybody else. 
 The war opened with an argument between Comrade Martov and Comrade Lieber, the leader of the Bundists (pp. 
 171-72). 
 Martov argued that the demand for “equalityof citizens” was enough. 
 “Freedom of language” was rejected,but “equality of languages” was forthwith proposed, andComrade Egorov joined Lieber in the fray. 
 Martov declaredthat it was fetishism “when speakers insist that nationalities are equal and transfer inequality to the sphere of language, whereas the question should be examined from just theopposite angle: inequality of nationalities exists, and one ofits expressions is that people belonging to certain nationsare deprived of the right to use their mother tongue”(p. 
 172). 
 There Martov was absolutely right. 
 The totally baseless attempt of Lieber and Egorov to insist on the cor-rectness of their formulation and make out that we wereunwilling or unable to uphold the principle of equality ofnationalities was indeed a sort of fetishism. 
 Actually,they were, like “fetish-worshippers”, defending the wordand not the principle, acting not from fear of committing an error of principle, but from fear of what people might say. 
 This shaky mentality (what if “others” blame us forthis?)—which we already noted in connection with theOrganising Committee incident—was quite clearly displayedhere by our entire “Centre”. 
 Another of its spokesmen, theMining Area delegate Lvov, who stood close to Yuzhny Rabochy , declared that “the question of the suppression of languages which has been raised by the border districts isa very serious one. 
 It is important to include a point on language in our programme and thus obviate any possibility of the Social-Democrats being suspected of Russifying ten-dencies. 
” A remarkable explanation of the “seriousness” of the question. 
 It is very serious because possible suspicions on the part of the border districts must be obviated! Thespeaker says absolutely nothing on the substance of thequestion, he does not rebut the charge of fetishism butentirely confirms it, for he shows a complete lack of argu-ments of his own and merely talks about what the border districts may say. 
 Everything they may say will be untrue —he is told. 
 But instead of examining whether it is trueor not, he replies: “ They may suspect . 
” Such a presentation of the question, coupled with the claim that it is serious and important, does indeed raise an issue of principle, but by no means the one the Liebers, Egorovs, and Lvovs would discern in it. 
 The principle in-volved is: should we leave it to the organisations and mem-bers of the Party to apply the general and fundamentaltheses of the programme to their specific conditions, and todevelop them for the purpose of such application, or are we, merely out of fear of suspicion, to fill the programme with petty details, minutiae, repetitions, and casuistry? Theprinciple involved is: how can Social-Democrats discern(“suspect”) in a fight against casuistry an attempt to restrictelementary democratic rights ana liberties? When are wegoing to wean ourselves at last from this fetishist worship of casuistry?—that was the thought that occurred to us when watching this struggle over “languages”. 
 The grouping of the delegates in this struggle is made particularly clear by the abundant roll-call votes. 
 Therewere as many as three. 
 All the time the Iskra core was solidly opposed by the anti-Iskra -ists (eight votes) and, with very slight fluctuations, by the whole Centre (Makhov, Lvov, Egorov, Popov, Medvedev, Ivanov, Tsaryov, andByelov—only the last two vacillated at first, now abstaining,now voting with us, and it was only during the third votethat their position became fully defined). 
 Of the Iskra -ists, several fell away—chiefly the Caucasians (three with six votes)—and thanks to this the “fetishist” trend ultimately gained the upper hand. 
 During the third vote, when the fol-lowers of both trends had clarified their position most fully, the three Caucasians, with six votes, broke away from the majority Iskra -ists and went, over to the other side; two delegates—Posadovsky and Kostich—with two votes, fell away from the minority Iskra -ists. 
 During the first two votes, the following had gone over to the other side orabstained: Lensky, Stepanov, and Gorsky of the Iskra -ist majority, and Deutsch of the minority. 
 The falling away of eight “Iskra ”-ist votes (out of a total of thirty-three ) gave the superiority to the coalition of the anti-“Iskra ”-ists and the unstable elements . 
 It was just this fundamental fact of the Congress grouping that was repeated (only with other Iskra -ists falling away) during the vote on Paragraph 1 of theRules and during the elections. 
 It is not surprising thatthose who were defeated in the elections now carefully close their eyes to the political reasons for that defeat, to the starting-points of that conflict of shades which progressively revealed the unstable and politically spineless elementsand exposed them ever more relentlessly in the eyes of theParty. 
 The equality of languages incident shows us thisconflict all the more clearly because at that time Comrade Martov had not yet earned the praises and approval of Akimov and Makhov. 
 F. 
 THE AGRARIAN PROGRAMME The inconsistency of principle of the anti-Iskra -ists and the “Centre” was also clearly brought out by the debate on the agrarian programme, which took up so much time atthe Congress (see Minutes, pp. 
 190-226) and raised quite anumber of extremely interesting points. 
 As was to be expect-ed, the campaign against the programme was launched byComrade Martynov (after some minor remarks by Comrades Lieber and Egorov). 
 He brought out the old argument about redressing “this particular historical injustice”, whereby,he claimed, we were indirectly “sanctifying other historicalinjustices”, and so on. 
 He was joined by Comrade Egorov,who even found that “the significance of this programme isunclear. 
 Is it a programme for ourselves, that is, does it define our demands, or do we want to make it popular?” (!?!?) Comrade Lieber said he “would like to make the samepoints as Comrade Egorov”. 
 Comrade Makhov spoke up in his usual positive manner and declared that “the majority [?] of the speakers positively cannot understand what the programme submitted means and what its aims are”. 
 The proposed programme, you see, “can hardly be considered aSocial-Democratic agrarian programme”; it ... “smacks some-what of a game at redressing historical injustices”; it bears“the trace of demagogy and adventurism”. 
 As a theoreticaljustification of this profundity came the caricature and over-simplification so customary in vulgar Marxism: the Iskra -ists, we were told, “want to treat the peasants as somethinghomogeneous in composition; but as the peasantry splitup into classes long ago [?], advancing a single programmemust inevitably render the whole programme demagogicand make it adventurist when put into practice (p. 
 202). 
 Comrade Makhov here “blurted out” the real reason why our agrarian programme meets with the disapproval of manySocial-Democrats, who are prepared to “recognise” Iskra (as Makhov himself did) but who have absolutely failed tograsp its trend, its theoretical and tactical position. 
 It wasthe vulgarisation of Marxism as applied to so complex and many-sided a phenomenon as the present-day system of Russian peasant economy, and not differences over partic-ulars, that was and is responsible for the failure to under-stand this programme. 
 And on this vulgar-Marxist standpointthe leaders of the anti-Iskra elements (Lieber and Martynov) and of the “Centre” (Egorov and Makhov) quickly found themselves in harmony. 
 Comrade Egorov gave frank ex-pression also to one of the characteristic features of Yuzhny Rabochy and the groups and circles gravitating towards it, namely, their failure to grasp the importance of thepeasant movement, their failure to grasp that it was notoverestimation, but, on the contrary, underestimation of its importance (and a lack of forces to utilise it) that was the weak side of our Social-Democrats at the time of the firstfamous peasant revolts. 
 “I am far from sharing the infatua-tion of the editorial board for the peasant movement,”said Comrade Egorov, “an infatuation to which many Social-Democrats have succumbed since the peasant disturbances. 
” But, unfortunately, Comrade Egorov did not take the trou-ble to give the Congress any precise idea of what this infat-uation of the editorial board consisted in; he did not take the trouble to make specific reference to any of the material published by Iskra . 
 Moreover, he forgot that all the funda-mental points of our agrarian programme had already been developed by Iskra in its third issue, * that is, long before the peasant disturbances. 
 Those whose “recognition” ofIskra was not merely verbal might well have given a little more attention to its theoretical and tactical principles! “No, we cannot do much among the peasants!” Comrade Egorov exclaimed, and he went on to indicate that this exclamation was not meant as a protest against any particu-lar “infatuation”, but as a denial of our entire position: “Itmeans that our slogan cannot compete with the slogan ofthe adventurists. 
” A most characteristic formulation ofan unprincipled attitude, which reduces everything to “com-petition” between the slogans of different parties! And this was said after the speaker had pronounced himself “satis-fied” with the theoretical explanations, which pointed outthat we strove for lasting success in our agitation, undis-mayed by temporary failures, and that lasting success (asagainst the resounding clamour of our “competitors”... for a short time) was impossible unless the programme had a firm theoretical basis (p. 
 196). 
 What confusion is disclosedby this assurance of “satisfaction” followed by a repetitionof the vulgar precepts inherited from the old Economism,for which the “competition of slogans” decided everything—not only the agrarian question, but the entire programme and tactics of the economic and political struggle! “You will not induce the agricultural labourer,” Comrade Egorov said,“to fight side by side with the rich peasant for the cut-offlands, which to no small extent are already in this richpeasant’s hands. 
” There again you have the same over-simplification, un-doubtedly akin to our opportunist Economism, which insisted that it was impossible to “induce” the proletarian to fightfor what was to no small extent in the hands of the bourgeoi-sie and would fall into its hands to an even larger extent inthe future. 
 There again you have the vulgarisation that for-gets the Russian peculiarities of the general capitalist rela-tions between the agricultural labourer and the rich peas-*See present edition, Vol. 
 4, pp. 
 420-28. 
— Ed. 
 ant. 
 Actually, the cut-off lands today oppress the agricul-tural labourer as well , and he does not have to be “induced” to fight for emancipation from his state of servitude. 
 It is certain intellectuals who have to be “induced”—induced totake a wider view of their tasks, induced to renounce stereo-typed formulas when discussing specific questions, inducedto take account of the historical situation, which compli-cates and modifies our aims. 
 It is only the superstition that the muzhik is stupid—a superstition which, as Comrade Mar-tov rightly remarked (p. 
 202), was to be detected in thespeeches of Comrade Makhov and the other opponents of theagrarian programme—only this superstition explains whythese opponents forget our agricultural labourer’s actualconditions of life. 
 Having simplified the question into a naked contrast of worker and capitalist, the spokesmen of our “Centre” tried,as often happens, to ascribe their own narrow-mindednessto the muzhik. 
 “It is precisely because I consider the muzhik,within the limits of his narrow class outlook, a clever fellow,”Comrade Makhov remarked, “that I believe he will stand for the petty-bourgeois ideal of seizure and division. 
” Two things are obviously confused here: the definition of the classoutlook of the muzhik as that of a petty bourgeois, and the restriction , the reduction of this outlook to “narrow limits”. 
 It is in this reduction that the mistake of the Egorovs andMakhovs lies (just as the mistake of the Martynovs and Aki-movs lay in reducing the outlook of the proletarian to “nar-row limits”). 
 For both logic and history teach us that the pet-ty-bourgeois class outlook may be more or less narrow, andmore or less progressive, precisely because of the dual statusof the petty bourgeois. 
 And far from dropping our hands indespair because of the narrowness (“stupidity”) of the mu-zhik or because he is governed by “prejudice”, we must work unremittingly to widen his outlook and help his reason totriumph over his prejudice. 
 The vulgar-“Marxist” view of the Russian agrarian question found its culmination in the concluding words of ComradeMakhov’s speech, in which that faithful champion of the old Iskra editorial board set forth his principles. 
 It was not for nothing that these words were greeted with applause ...true, it was ironical applause. 
 “I do not know, of course, what to call a misfortune”, said Comrade Makhov, outraged by Plekhanov’s statement that we were not at all alarmed by the movement for a General Redistribution,94 and that we would not be the ones to hold back this progressive (bour-geois progressive) movement. 
 “But this revolution, if it canbe called such, would not be a revolutionary one. 
 It wouldbe truer to call it, not revolution, but reaction ( laughter ), a revolution that was more like a riot.... 
 Such a revolution would throw us back, and it would require a certain amount of time to get back to the position we have today. 
 Today wehave far more than during the French Revolution ( ironical applause ), we have a Social-Democratic Party ( laughter ).... 
” Yes, a Social-Democratic Party which reasoned like Makhov,or which had central institutions of the Makhov persuasion, would indeed only deserve to be laughed at .... 
 Thus we see that even on the purely theoretical questions raised by the agrarian programme, the already familiargrouping at once appeared. 
 The anti-Iskra -ists (eight votes) rushed into the fray on behalf of vulgar Marxism, and theleaders of the “Centre”, the Egorovs and Makhovs, trailed after them, constantly erring and straying into the same narrow outlook. 
 It is quite natural, therefore, that the vot-ing on certain points of the agrarian programme should haveresulted in thirty and thirty-five votes in favour (pp. 
 225and 226), that is, approximately the same figure as we ob-served in the dispute over the place of the Bund question on the agenda, in the Organising Committee incident, and in the question of shutting down Yuzhny Rabochy . 
 An issue had only to arise which did not quite come within the alreadyestablished and customary pattern, and which called forsome independent application of Marx’s theory to peculiarand new (new to the Germans) social and economic relations, and Iskra -ists who proved equal to the problems only made up three-fifths of the vote, while the whole “Centre” turnedand followed the Liebers and Martynovs. 
 Yet Comrade Mar-tov strives to gloss over this obvious fact, fearfully avoidingall mention of votes where the shades of opinion were clearlyrevealed! It is clearly evident from the debate on the agrarian pro-gramme that the Iskra -ists had to fight against a good two-fifths of the Congress. 
 On this question the Caucasian delegates took up an absolutely correct stand—due largely, in all probability, to the fact that first-hand knowledge of the forms taken by the numerous remnants of feudalism in their localities kept them from the schoolboyishly ab-stract and bare contrasts that satisfied the Makhovs. 
 Marty-nov and Lieber, Makhov and Egorov were combated by Ple-khanov, by Gusev (who declared that he had “frequentlyencountered such a pessimistic view of our work in the coun-tryside” as Comrade Egorov’s “among the comrades active in Russia”), by Kostrov, 95 by Karsky and by Trotsky. 
 The latter rightly remarked that the “well-meant advice” ofthe critics of the agrarian programme “smacked too muchof philistinism ”. 
 It should only be said, since we are studying the political grouping at the Congress, that he was hardly correct when in this part of his speech (p. 
 208) he ranked Comrade Lange with Egorov and Makhov. 
 Anyone who readsthe minutes carefully will see that Lange and Gorin tookquite a different stand from Egorov and Makhov. 
 Lange andGorin did not like the formulation of the point on the cut-off lands; they fully understood the idea of our agrarian programme, but tried to apply it in a different way , worked constructively to find what they considered a more irre-proachable formulation, and in submitting their motionshad in view either to convince the authors of the programmeor else to side with them against all the non-Iskra -ists. 
 For example, one has only to compare Makhov’s motions to reject the whole agrarian programme (p. 
 212; nine for, thirty-eight against) or individual points in it (p. 
 216, etc. 
)with the position of Lange, who moved his own formulation of the point on the cut-off lands (p. 
 225), to become con-vinced of the radical difference between them. 
 * Referring to the arguments which smacked of “philis-tinism”, Comrade Trotsky pointed out that “in the approach-ing revolutionary period we must link ourselves with thepeasantry”.... 
 “In face of this task, the scepticism and polit-ical ‘far-sightedness’ of Makhov and Egorov are more harm-ful than any short-sightedness. 
” Comrade Kostich, anotherminority Iskra -ist, very aptly pointed to Comrade Ma-khov’s “unsureness of himself, of the stability of his princi-*Cf. 
 Gorin’s speech, p. 
 213 ples”—a description that fits our “Centre” to a tittle. 
 “In his pessimism Comrade Makhov is at one with Comrade Egorov, although they differ in shade,” Comrade Kostich continued. 
 “He forgets that the Social-Democrats are alreadyworking among the peasantry, are already directing theirmovement as far as possible. 
 And this pessimism narrowsthe scope of our work” (p. 
 210). 
 To conclude our examination of the Congress discussion of the programme, it is worth while mentioning the brief debate on the subject of supporting oppositional trends. 
Our programme clearly states that the Social-DemocraticParty supports “every oppositional and revolutionary move-ment directed against the existing social and political order in Russia ”. 
 One would think that this last reservation made it quite clear exactly which oppositional trends we support. 
 Nevertheless, the different shades that long ago developedin our Party at once revealed themselves here too , difficult as it was to suppose that any “perplexity or misunderstand-ing” was still possible on a question which had been chewedover so thoroughly! Evidently, it was not a matter of mis-understandings, but of shades . 
 Makhov, Lieber, and Mar-tynov at once sounded the alarm and again proved to be inso “compact” a minority that Comrade Martov would mostlikely have to attribute this too to intrigue, machination,diplomacy, and the other nice things (see his speech at theLeague Congress) to which people resort who are incapable of understanding the political reasons for the formation of “compact” groups of both minority and majority. 
 Makhov again began with a vulgar simplification of Marx-ism. 
 “Our only revolutionary class is the proletariat,”he declared, and from this correct premise he forthwith drewan incorrect conclusion: “The rest are of no account, they are mere hangers-on ( general laughter ).... 
 Yes, they are mere hangers-on and only out to reap the benefits. 
 I am againstsupporting them” (p. 
 226). 
 Comrade Makhov’s inimitableformulation of his position embarrassed many (of his sup-porters), but as a matter of fact Lieber and Martynov agreedwith him when they proposed deleting the word “opposi-tional” or restricting it by an addition: “democratic-opposi-tional”. 
 Plekhanov quite rightly took the field against this. 
amendment of Martynov’s. 
 “We must criticise the liberals,” he said, “expose their half-heartedness. 
 That is true.... 
 But while exposing the narrowness and limitations of all move-ments other than the Social-Democratic, it is our duty to explain to the proletariat that even a constitution whichdoes not confer universal suffrage would he a step forwardcompared with absolutism, and that therefore it should notprefer the existing order to such a constitution. 
” ComradesMartynov, Lieber, and Makhov would not agree with this and persisted in their position, which was attacked by Axel-rod, Starover, and Trotsky and once more by Plekhanov. 
Comrade Makhov managed on this occasion to surpass him-self. 
 First he had said that the other classes (other than theproletariat) were “of no account” and that he was “againstsupporting them”. 
 Then he condescended to admit that “while essentially it is reactionary, the bourgeoisie is often revo-lutionary—for example, in the struggle against feudalismand its survivals”. 
 “But there are some groups,” he continued,going from bad to worse, “which are always [?] reactionary—such are the handicraftsmen. 
” Such were the gems of theoryarrived at by those very leaders of our “Centre” who later foamed at the mouth in defence of the old editorial board! Even in Western Europe, where the guild system was sostrong, it was the handicraftsmen, like the other petty bour-geois of the towns, who displayed an exceptionally revolu-tionary spirit in the era of the fall of absolutism. 
 And it is particularly absurd of a Russian Social-Democrat to repeat without reflection what our Western comrades say about the handicraftsmen of today, that is, of an era separated by a cen-tury or half a century from the fall of absolutism. 
 To speak of the handicraftsmen in Russia being politically reaction-ary as compared with the bourgeoisie is merely to repeat a setphrase learnt by rote. 
 Unfortunately, there is no record in the minutes of the number of votes cast for the rejected amendments of Marty-nov, Makhov, and Lieber on this question. 
 All we can say is that, here too, the leaders of the anti-Iskra elements and one of the leaders of the “Centre” * joined forces in the already *Another leader of this same group, the “Centre”, Comrade Ego-rov, spoke on the question of supporting the oppositional trends ona different occasion, in connection with Axelrod’s resolution on the familiar grouping against the Iskra -ists. 
 Summing up the whole discussion on the programme , one cannot help seeing that of the debates which were at all animated and evoked general interest there was not one that failed to reveal the difference of shades which Comrade Martov and the newIskra editorial board now so carefully ignore. 
 G. 
 THE PARTY RULES. 
 COMRADE MARTOV’S DRAFT From the programme, the Congress passed to the Party Rules (we leave out the question of the Central Organ, alreadytouched on above, and the delegates’ reports, which themajority of the delegates were unfortunately unable to pre-sent in a satisfactory form). 
 Needless to say, the question of the Rules was of tremendous importance to all of us. 
 After all, Iskra had acted from the very outset not only as a press organ but also as an organisational nucleus. 
 In an editorial in its fourth issue (“Where To Begin”) Iskra had put forward a whole plan of organisation, * which it pursued systemat-ically and steadily over a period of three years . 
 When the Sec-ond Party Congress adopted Iskra as the Central Organ, two of the three points of the preamble of the resolution on thesubject (p. 
 147) were devoted precisely to this organisational plan and to “Iskra ’s” organisational ideas : its role in directing the practical work of the Party and the leading part it had Socialist-Revolutionaries (p. 
 359). 
 Comrade Egorov detected a “con-tradiction” between the demand in the programme for support o f every oppositional and revolutionary movement and the antagonistic attitude towards both the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the liberals. 
In another form, and approaching the question from a somewhatdifferent angle, Comrade Egorov here revealed the same narrow con-ception of Marxism, and the same unstable, semi-hostile attitudetowards the position of Iskra (which he had “recognised”), as Com-rades Makhov, Lieber, and Martynov had done. 
 *In his speech on the adoption of Iskra as the Central Organ, Comrade Popov said, inter alia : “I recall the article ‘Where To Begin’ in No. 
 3 or No. 
 4 of Iskra . 
 Many of the comrades active in Russia found it a tactless article; others thought this plan was fantastic, and themajority [?—probably the majority around Comrade Popov] attri-buted it solely to ambition” (p. 
 140). 
 As the reader sees, it is no newthing for me to hear my political views attributed to ambition—anexplanation now being rehashed by Comrade Axelrod and ComradeMartov. 
 played in the work of attaining unity. 
 It is quite natural, therefore, that the work of Iskra and the entire work of orga-nising the Party, the entire work of actually restoring the Par-ty, could not be regarded as finished until definite ideas of organisation had been adopted by the whole Party and for-mally enacted. 
 This task was to be performed by the Party’sRules of Organisation. 
 The principal ideas which Iskra strove to make the basis of the Party’s organisation amounted essentially to the fol-lowing two: first, the idea of centralism, which defined in principle the method of deciding all particular and detail questions of organisation; second, the special function of anorgan, a newspaper, for ideological leadership—an idea which took into account the temporary and special require-ments of the Russian Social-Democratic working-class move-ment in the existing conditions of political slavery, with the initial base of operations for the revolutionary assault being set up abroad. 
 The first idea, as the one matter of prin-ciple, had to pervade the entire Rules; the second, being a particular idea necessitated by temporary circumstances of place and mode of action, took the form of a seeming departure from centralism in the proposal to set up two centres , a Central Organ and a Central Committee . 
 Both these principal Iskra ideas of Party organisation had been devel-oped by me in the Iskra editorial (No. 
 4) “Where To Begin” * and in What Is To Be Done? ** and, finally, had been ex-plained in detail, in a form that was practically a finished set ofRules, in A Letter to a Comrade . 
 *** Actually, all that remai-ned was the work of formulating the paragraphs of theRules, which were to embody just those ideas if the recognitionof Iskra was not to be merely nominal, a mere conventional phrase. 
 In the preface to the new edition of my Letter to a Comrade I have already pointed out that a simple comparison of the Party Rules with that pamphlet is enough to establish the complete identity of the ideas of organisation contained in the two.

 A propos of the work of formulating Iskra ’s ideas of orga-nisation in the Rules, I must deal with a certain incident mentioned by Comrade Martov. 
 “...A statement of fact,”said Martov at the League Congress (p. 
 58), “will show you how far my lapse into opportunism on this paragraph [i. 
e. 
, Paragraph 1] was unexpected by Lenin. 
 About a month anda half or two months before the Congress I showed Lenin my draft, in which Paragraph 1 was formulated just in the way I proposed it at the Congress. 
 Lenin objected to my drafton the ground that it was too detailed, and told me that all he liked was the idea of Paragraph 1—the definition of Party membership—which he would incorporate in his Rules withcertain modifications, because he did not think my formula-tion was a happy one. 
 Thus, Lenin had long been acquainted with my formulation, he knew my views on this subject. 
You thus see that I came to the Congress with my visor up, that I did not conceal my views. 
 I warned him that I would oppose mutual co-optation, the principle of unanimity incases of co-optation to the Central Committee and the Cen-tral Organ, and so on. 
” As regards the warning about opposing mutual co-optation, we shall see in its proper place how matters really stood. 
 At present let us deal with this “open visor” of Martov’s Rules. 
 At the League Congress, recounting from memorythis episode of his unhappy draft (which he himself with-drew at the Congress because it was an unhappy one, but after the Congress, with his characteristic consistency, againbrought out into the light of day), Martov, as so often hap-pens, forgot a good deal and therefore again got things mud-dled. 
 One would have thought there had already been casesenough to warn him against quoting private conversations and relying on his memory (people involuntarily recall only what is to their advantage!)—nevertheless, for want of anyother, Comrade Martov used unsound material. 
 Today even Comrade Plekhanov is beginning to imitate him—evidently, a bad example is contagious. 
 I could not have “liked” the “idea” of Paragraph 1 of Mar-tov’s draft, for that draft contained no idea that came up at the Congress. 
 His memory played him false. 
 I have been for-tunate enough to find Martov’s draft among my papers, and in it “ Paragraph 1 is formulated n o t in the way he proposed it at the Congress ”! So much for the “open visor”! Paragraph 1 in Martov’s draft: “A member of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party is one who, accepting itsprogramme, works actively to accomplish its aims underthe control and direction of the organs [ sic!] of the Party. 
” Paragraph 1 in my draft: “A member of the Party is one who accepts its programme and who supports the Party both financially and by personal participation in one of the Partyorganisations. 
” Paragraph 1 as formulated by Martov at the Congress and adopted by the Congress: “A member of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party is one who accepts its programme, supports the Party financially, and renders it regular person-al assistance under the direction of one of its organisa-tions. 
” It is clearly evident from this juxtaposition that there is no idea in Martov’s draft, but only an empty phrase . 
 That Party members must work under the control and direction of the organs of the Party goes without saying; it cannot be otherwise , and only those talk about it who love to talk without saying anything, who love to drown “Rules” in aflood of verbiage and bureaucratic formulas (that is, formulasuseless for the work and supposed to be useful for display). 
The idea of Paragraph 1 appears only when the question is asked: can the organs of the Party exercise actual direction over Party members who do not belong to any of the Party organisations ? There is not even a trace of this idea in Com-rade Martov’s draft. 
 Consequently, I could not have been acquainted with the “views” of Comrade Martov “on this subject”, for in Comrade Martov’s draft there are no views on this subject . 
 Comrade Martov’s statement of fact proves to be a muddle . 
 About Comrade Martov, on the other hand, it does have to be said that from my draft “he knew my views on thissubject” and did not protest against them, did not rejectthem, either on the editorial board, although my draft was shown to everyone two or three weeks before the Congress, or in talking to the delegates, who were acquainted only with my draft. 
 More, even at the Congress , when I moved my draft Rules * and defended them before the election of the Rules Committee , Comrade Martov distinctly stated: “I associate myself with Comrade Lenin’s conclusions. 
 Only on two points do I disagree with him ” (my italics)—on the mode of constituting the Council and on unanimous co-optation (p. 
 157). 
 Not a word was yet said about any difference over Paragraph 1. 
 In his pamphlet on the state of siege, Comrade Martov saw fit to recall his Rules once more, and in great detail. 
 Heassures us there that his Rules, to which, with the exceptionof certain minor particulars, he would be prepared to sub-scribe even now (February 1904—we cannot say how it willbe three months hence), “quite clearly expressed his disap-proval of hypertrophy of centralism” (p. 
 iv). 
 The reason he did not submit this draft to the Congress, Comrade Martov now explains, was, firstly, that “his Iskra training had im-bued him with disdain for Rules” (when it suits ComradeMartov, the word Iskra means for him, not a narrow circle spirit, but the most steadfast of trends! It is a pity, however,that Comrade Martov’s Iskra training did not imbue him in three years with disdain for the anarchistic phrases by whichthe unstable mentality of the intellectual is capable ofjustifying the violation of Rules adopted by common con-sent). 
 Secondly, that, don’t you see, he, Comrade Martov,wanted to avoid “introducing any dissonance into the tacticsof that basic organisational nucleus which Iskra constituted”. 
 Wonderfully consistent, isn’t it? On a question of prin-ciple regarding an opportunist formulation of Paragraph 1 or hypertrophy of centralism, Comrade Martov was so afraid *Incidentally, the Minutes Committee, in Appendix XI, has published the draft Rules “ moved at the Congress by Lenin ” (p. 
 393). 
 Here the Minutes Committee has also muddled things a little. 
 It has Ed. 
), which was shown to all the delegates (and to many before the Congress), with the draft moved at the Congress , and published the form-er under the guise of the latter. 
 Of course, I have no objection to my drafts being published, even in all their stages of preparation , but there was no need to cause confusion. 
 And confusion has been caused, for Popov and Martov (pp. 
 154 and 157) criticised formulations in the draft I actually m oved at the Congress which are not in the draft published by the Minutes Committee (cf. 
 p. 
 394, paragraphs 7 and 11). 
 With a little more care, the mistake could easily have been detected simply by comparing the pages I mention. 
confused my original draft (see present edition, Vol. 
 6, pp. 
 474-76. 
— of any dissonance (which is terrible only from the narrowest circle point of view) that he did not set forth his disagreement even to a nucleus like the editorial board! On the practical question of the composition of the central bodies, ComradeMartov appealed for the assistance of the Bund and theRabocheye Dyelo -ists against the vote of the majority of the Iskra organisation (that real basic organisational nucleus ). 
 The “dissonance” in his phrases, which smuggle in the circle spirit in defence of the quasi-editorial board only to repudi-ate the “circle spirit” in the appraisal of the question by thosebest qualified to judge—this dissonance Comrade Martovdoes not notice. 
 To punish him, we shall quote his draftRules in full , noting for our part what views and what hyper-trophy they reveal *: “Draft of Party Rules. 
—1. 
 Party Membership. 
—1) A member of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party is one who, accepting its programme, works actively to accomplish its aims under the con-trol and direction of the organs of the Party. 
—2) Expulsion of a mem-ber from the Party for conduct incompatible with the interests of the Party shall be decided by the Central Committee. 
 [The sentence of expulsion, giving the reasons, shall be preserved in the Party files andshall be communicated, on request, to every Party committee. 
 The Central Committee’s decision to expel a member may be appealed against to the Congress on the demand of two or more committees. 
]”I shall indicate by square brackets the provisions in Martov’s draft which are obviously meaningless, failing to contain not only “ideas”, but even any definite conditions or requirements—like the inimitablespecification in the “Rules” as to where exactly a sentence of expulsion is to be preserved, or the provision that the Central Committee’s decision to expel a member (and not all its decisions in general?) maybe appealed against to the Congress. 
 This, indeed, is hypertrophy of verbiage, or real bureaucratic formalism, which frames superfluous, patently useless or red-tapist, points and paragraphs. 
 “II. 
 LocalCommittees. 
—3) In its local work, the Party is represented by the Party committees” (how new and clever!). 
 “4) [As Party committees are recognised all those existing at the time of the Second Congressand represented at the Congress. 
]—5) New Party committees, in addition to those mentioned in Paragraph 4, shall be appointed by the Central Committee [which shall either endorse as a committee theexisting membership of the given local organisation, or shall set up a local committee by reforming the latter]. 
—6) The committees may add to their membership by means of co-optation. 
—7) The Central *I might mention that unfortunately I could not find the first variant of Comrade Martov’s draft, which consisted of some forty-eight paragraphs and suffered even more from “hypertrophy” of worth-less formalism. 
 Committee has the right to augment the membership of a local commit-tee with such numbers of comrades (known to it) as shall not exceed one-third of the total membership of the committee. 
” A perfect sample of bureaucracy. 
 Why not exceeding one-third? What is the purpose ofthis? What is the sense of this restriction which restricts nothing, see-ing that the augmenting may be repeated over and over again? “8) [In the event of a local committee falling apart or being broken up bypersecution” (does this mean that not all the members have been ar-rested?), “the Central Committee shall re-establish it. 
]” (Without regard to Paragraph 7? Does not Comrade Martov perceive a similarity be-tween Paragraph 8 and those Russian laws on orderly conduct which command citizens to work on weekdays and rest on holidays?) “9) [A regular Party Congress may instruct the Central Committee toreform the composition of any local committee if the activities of the latter are found incompatible with the interests of the Party. 
 In that event the existing committee shall be deemed dissolved and thecomrades in its area of operation exempt from subordination * to it. 
]” The provision contained in this paragraph is as highly useful as the provision contained to this day in the Russian law which reads: “Drunk-enness is forbidden to all and sundry. 
” “10) [The local Party commit-tees shall direct all the propagandist, agitational, and organisational activities of the Party in their localities and shall do all in their powerto assist the Central Committee and the Central Organs of the Party in carrying out the general Party tasks entrusted to them. 
]” Phew! What in the name of all that’s holy is the purpose of this? “11) [Theinternal arrangements of a local organisation, the mutual relations between a committee and the groups subordinate to it” (do you hear that, Comrade Axelrod?), “and the limits of the competence and au-tonomy” (are not the limits of competence the same as the limits of autonomy?) “of these groups shall be determined by the committee itself and communicated to the Central Committee and the editorialboard of the Central Organs. 
]” (An omission: it is not stated where these communications are to be filed. 
) “12) [All groups subordinate to committees, and individual Party members, have the right todemand that their opinions and recommendations on any subject be communicated to the Central Committee of the Party and its Cen-tral Organs. 
]—13) The local Party committees shall contribute fromtheir revenues to the funds of the Central Committee such sums as the Central Committee shall assign to their share. 
—III. 
 Organisations for the Purpose of Agitation in Languages Other than Russian. 
—14) [For the purpose of carrying on agitation in any non-Russian language and of organising the workers among whom such agitation is carried on, separate organisations may be set up in places wheresuch specialised agitation and the setting up of such organisations are deemed necessary. 
]—15) The question as to whether such a neces-sity exists shall be decided by the Central Committee of the Party. 
 *We would draw Comrade Axelrod’s attention to this word. 
 Why this is terrible! Here are the roots of that “Jacobinism” which goesto the length even ... even of altering the composition of an editorial board.... 
 and in disputed cases by the Party Congress. 
” The first part of this paragraph is superfluous in view of subsequent provisions in the Rules, and the second part, concerning disputed cases, is simply ludicrous. 
 “16) [The local organisations mentioned in Paragraph 14 shall beautonomous in their special affairs but shall act under the control of the local committee and be subordinate to it, the forms of this con-trol and the character of the organisational relations between the com-mittee and the special organisation being determined by the local committee. 
” (Well, thank God! It is now quite clear that this whole spate of empty words was superfluous. 
) “In respect of the generalaffairs of the Party, such organisations shall act as part of the commit-tee organisation. 
]—17) [The local organisations mentioned in Para-graph 14 may form autonomous leagues for the effective performanceof their special tasks. 
 These leagues may have their own special press and administrative bodies, both being under the direct control of the Central Committee of the Party. 
 The Rules of these leagues shall bedrawn up by themselves, but shall be subject to endorsement by the Central Committee of the Party. 
]—18) [The autonomous leagues men-tioned in Paragraph 17 may include local Party committees if, byreason of local conditions, these devote themselves mainly to agitation in the given language. 
 Note . 
 While forming part of the autonomous league such a committee does not cease to be a committee of theParty.

) “19) [The relations of local organisations belonging to an autonomous league with the central bodies of thatleague shall be controlled by the local committees.

—23) The functions of the press organs ofthe Party shall be: to exercise ideological direction of Party life, to conduct propaganda for the Party programme, and to carry out theo-retical and popular elaboration of the world outlook of Social-Democ-racy.

—29) The Central Committee shall be appointed at Party con-gresses and shall function until the next congress. 
 The Central Commit-tee may augment its membership by means of co-optation, without restriction as to numbers, in each case informing the editorial boardof the Central Organs of the Party.

 It shall be headed by an elected administrative body. 
— 31) The autonomous leagues belonging to the Party may maintain branches abroad to assist in carrying out their special tasks.

— 39) Congresses shall, as far as possible, be convened once every two years. 
 [If for reasons beyond the control of the Central Committee acongress cannot be convened within this period, the Central Committee shall on its own responsibility postpone it. 
]” Any reader who, by way of an exception, has had the patience to read these so-called Rules to the end assuredlywill not expect me to give special reasons for the followingconclusions. 
 First conclusion: the Rules suffer from almostincurable dropsy. 
 Second conclusion: it is impossible to dis-cover in these Rules any special shade of organisational viewsevincing a disapproval of hypertrophy of centralism. 
 Thirdconclusion: Comrade Martov acted very wisely indeed inconcealing from the eyes of the world (and withholding fromdiscussion at the Congress) more than 38/39 of his Rules.

 DISCUSSION ON CENTRALISM PRIOR TO THE SPLIT AMONG THE ISKRA -ISTS Before passing to the really interesting question of the formulation of Paragraph 1 of the Rules, a question whichundoubtedly disclosed the existence of different shades ofopinion, let us dwell a little on that brief general discussionof the Rules which occupied the 14th and part of the 15th Congress sittings. 
 This discussion is of some significance inasmuch as it preceded the complete divergence within the Iskra organisation over the composition of the central bodies, whereas the subsequent debate on the Rules in general, andon co-optation in particular, took place after this divergence in the Iskra organisation. 
 Naturally, before the divergence we were able to express our views more impartially, in the sense that they were more independent of views about thepersonal composition of the Central Committee, which be-came such a keen issue with us all. 
 Comrade Martov, as Ihave already remarked, associated himself (p. 
 157) with my views on organisation, only making the reservation that he differed on two points of detail . 
 Both the anti-Iskra -ists and the “Centre”, on the contrary, at once took the fieldagainst both fundamental ideas of the whole Iskra organi-sational plan (and, consequently, against the Rules intheir entirety): against centralism and against “two centres”. 
Comrade Lieber referred to my Rules as “organised distrust” and discerned decentralism in the proposal for two centres (as did Comrades Popov and Egorov). 
 Comrade Akimovwanted to broaden the jurisdiction of the local committees,and, in particular, to grant them themselves “the right toalter their composition”. 
 “They should be allowed greaterfreedom of action.... 
 The local committees should be elected by the active workers in their localities, just as the Central Committee is elected by the representatives of all the activeorganisations in Russia. 
 And if even this cannot be allowed,let the number of members that the Central Committee mayappoint to local committees be limited.... 
” (p. 
 158). 
 Com-rade Akimov, as you see, suggested an argument against “hypertrophy of centralism”, but Comrade Martov remained deaf to these weighty arguments, not yet having been in-duced by his defeat over the composition of the central bodies to follow in Akimov’s wake. 
 He remained deaf even when Comrade Akimov suggested to him the “ idea ” of his own Rules (Paragraph 7—restriction of the Central Committee’s right to appoint members to the committees)! At that time Com-rade Martov still did not want any “dissonance” with us,and for that reason tolerated a dissonance both with Com-rade Akimov and with himself.... 
 At that time the onlyopponents of “monstrous centralism” were those to whom Iskra ’s centralism was clearly disadvantageous : it was opposed by Akimov, Lieber, and Goldblatt, followed , cautiously and circumspectly (so that they could always turn back), byEgorov (see pp. 
 156 and 276) and such like. 
 At that time itwas still clear to the vast majority of the Party that it wasthe parochial, circle interests of the Bund, Yuzhny Rabochy , etc. 
, that evoked the protest against centralism. 
 For that matter, now too it is clear to the majority of the Party thatit is the circle interests of the old Iskra editorial board that cause it to protest against centralism.... 
 Take, for example, Comrade Goldblatt’s speech (pp. 
 160-61). 
 He inveighs against my “monstrous” centralism and claims that it would lead to the “destruction” of the lower organisations, that it is “permeated through and throughwith the desire to give the centre unrestricted powers andthe unrestricted right to interfere in everything”, that itallows the organisations “only one right—to submit withouta murmur to orders from above”, etc. 
 “The centre proposed by the draft would find itself in a vacuum, it would have no peripheral organisations around it, but only an amor-phous mass in which its executive agents would move. 
”Why, this is exactly the kind of false phrase-mongering t o which the Martovs and Axelrods proceeded to treat us aftertheir defeat at the Congress. 
 The Bund was laughed at when it fought our centralism while granting its own central body even more definite unrestricted rights (e. 
g. 
, to appoint and expel members, and even to refuse to admit delegates tocongresses). 
 And when people sort things out, the howlsof the minority will also be laughed at, for they cried out against centralism and against the Rules when they were in the minority, but lost no time in taking advantage of the Rules once they had managed to make themselves themajority. 
 Over the question of two centres, the grouping was also clearly evident: all the Iskra -ists were opposed by Lieber, by Akimov (the first to strike up the now favourite Axelrod-Martov tune about the Central Organ predominating overthe Central Committee on the Council), by Popov, and byEgorov. 
 From the ideas of organisation which the old Iskra had always advocated (and which the Popovs and Egorovshad verbally approved!), the plan for two centres followed of itself. 
 The policy of the old Iskra cut across the plans of Yuzhny Rabochy , the plans to create a parallel popular organ and to convert it virtually into the dominant organ. 
 Therelies the root of the paradox, so strange at first glance, thatall the anti-Iskra -ists and the entire Marsh were in favour of one central body, that is, of seemingly greater centralism . 
 Of course, there were some delegates (especially among the Marsh) who probably did not have a clear idea where theorganisational plans of Yuzhny Rabochy would lead, and were bound to lead in the nature of things, but they were impelledto follow the anti-Iskra -ists by their very irresoluteness and unsureness of themselves. 
 Of the speeches by Iskra -ists during this debate on the Rules (the one preceding the split among the Iskra -ists), particularly noteworthy were those of Comrades Martov(“association” with my ideas of organisation) and Trotsky. 
Every word of the answer the latter gave Comrades Akimovand Lieber exposes the utter falsity of the “minority’s” post-Congress conduct and theories. 
 “The Rules, he [Comrade Akimov] said, do not define the jurisdiction of the CentralCommittee with enough precision. 
 I cannot agree with him. 
On the contrary, this definition is precise and means thatinasmuch as the Party is one whole, it must be ensuredcontrol over the local committees. 
 Comrade Lieber said, borrowing my expression, that the Rules were ‘organised distrust’. 
 That is true. 
 But I used this expression in refer-ence to the Rules proposed by the Bund spokesmen, which rep-resented organised distrust on the part of a section of theParty towards the whole Party. 
 Our Rules, on the otherhand” (at that time, before the defeat over the composition of the central bodies, the Rules were “ours”!), “represent the orga-nised distrust of the Party towards all its sections, that is,control over all local, district, national, and other organi-Page 71 of the manuscript of One Step Forward, Two Steps Back . 
 1904 Reduced Page 71 of the manuscript of One Step Forward, Two Steps Back . 
 1904 Reduced sations” (p. 
 158). 
 Yes, our Rules are here correctly described, and we would advise those to bear this more constantly in mind who are now assuring us with an easy conscience that it was the intriguing majority who conceived and introducedthe system of “organised distrust” or, which is the same thing,the “state of siege”. 
 One has only to compare this speech withthe speeches at the Congress of the League Abroad to get aspecimen of political spinelessness, a specimen of how the views of Martov and Co. 
 changed depending on whether the matter concerned their own group of a lower order or some-one else’s. 
 I. 
 PARAGRAPH ONE OF THE RULES We have already cited the different formulations around which an interesting debate flared up at the Congress. 
 This debate took up nearly two sittings and ended with two roll-call votes (during the entire Congress there were, if I am not mistaken, only eight roll-call votes, which were resorted to only in very important cases because of the great loss oftime they involved). 
 The question at issue was undoubtedlyone of principle. 
 The interest of the Congress in the debate was tremendous. 
 All the delegates voted—a rare occurrence at our Congress (as at any big congress) and one that like-wise testifies to the interest displayed by the disputants. 
 What, then, was the substance of the matter in dispute? I already said at the Congress, and have since repeated ittime and again, that “I by no means consider our difference [over Paragraph 1] so vital as to be a matter of life or death to the Party. 
 We shall certainly not perish because of an unfortunate clause in the Rules!” (P. 
 250. 
) * Taken by itself, this difference, although it did reveal shades of principle,could never have called forth that divergence (actually, tospeak unreservedly, that split) which took place after the Congress. 
 But every little difference may become a big one if it is insisted on, if it is put into the foreground, if people set about searching for all the roots and branches-of the difference. 
 Every little difference may assume tremendous importance if it serves as the starting-point for a swing towards definite mistaken views, and if these mistaken *See present edition, Vol. 
 6, p. 
 499. 
— Ed. 
 views are combined, by virtue of new and additional diver-gences, with anarchistic actions which bring the Party to the point of a split. 
 And that is just what happened in the present case. 
 The comparatively slight difference over Paragraph 1 has nowacquired tremendous importance, because it was this thatstarted the swing towards the opportunist profundities andanarchistic phrase-mongering of the minority (especially at the League Congress, and subsequently in the columns of the new Iskra as well). 
 It was this that marked the beginning of the coalition of the Iskra -ist minority with the anti-Iskra -ists and the Marsh, which assumed final and definite shape by the time of the elections, and without understand-ing which it is impossible to understand the major and fun-damental divergence over the composition of the central bodies. 
 The slight mistake of Martov and Axelrod overParagraph 1 was a slight crack in our pot (as I put it at theLeague Congress). 
 The pot could be bound tight with ahard knot (and not a hangman’s knot, as it was misunder-stood by Martov, who during the League Congress was in a state bordering on hysteria); or all efforts could be directed towards widening the crack and breaking the pot in two. 
And that is what happened, thanks to the boycott and similaranarchistic moves of the zealous Martovites. 
 The differenceover Paragraph 1 played no small part in the elections to thecentral bodies, and Martov’s defeat in the elections led him into a “struggle over principles” with the use of grossly mechanical and even brawling methods (such as his speechesat the Congress of the League of Russian RevolutionarySocial-Democracy Abroad). 
 Now, after all these happenings, the question of Paragraph 1 has thus assumed tremendous importance , and we must clearly realise both the character of the Congress groupings in the voting on this paragraph and—far more importantstill—the real nature of those shades of opinion which re-vealed or began to reveal themselves over Paragraph 1. 
 Now , after the events with which the reader is familiar, the ques-tion stands as follows: Did Martov’s formulation, which was supported by Axelrod, reflect his (or their) instability, vacillation, and political vagueness, as I expressed it at theParty Congress (p. 
 333), his (or their) deviation towards Jaurèsism and anarchism, as Plekhanov suggested at the League Congress (League Minutes, p. 
 102 and elsewhere),’ Or did my formulation, which was supported by Plekhanov, reflect a wrong, bureaucratic, formalistic, Jack-in-officeun-Social-Democratic conception of centralism? Opportun-ism and anarchism , or bureaucracy and formalism ?—that is the way the question stands now , when the little difference has become a big one. 
 And when discussing the pros and cons of my formulation on their merits , we must bear in mind just this presentation of the question, which has been forced upon us all by the events, or, I would say if it did not sound toopompous, has been evolved by history. 
 Let us begin the examination of these pros and cons with an analysis of the Congress debate. 
 The first speech, that of Comrade Egorov, is interesting only for the fact that his attitude ( non liquet , it is not yet clear to me, I do not yet know where the truth lies) was very characteristic of theattitude of many delegates, who found it difficult to graspthe rights and wrongs of this really new and fairly complexand detailed question. 
 The next speech, that of Comrade Axelrod, at once made the issue one of principle. 
 This was the first speech Comrade Axelrod made at the Congress on ques-tions of principle, one might even say the first speech he madeat all, and it can scarcely be claimed that his début with thecelebrated “professor” was particularly fortunate. 
 “I think,”Comrade Axelrod said, “that we must draw a distinction between the concepts party and organisation. 
 These two concepts are being confused here. 
 And the confusion isdangerous. 
” That was the first argument against my formula-tion. 
 Examine it more closely. 
 When I say that the Partyshould be the sum (and not the mere arithmetical sum, but a complex) of organisations , * does that mean that I “confuse” *The word “organisation” is commonly employed in two senses, a broad and a narrow one. 
 In the narrow sense it signifies an individ-ual nucleus of a collective of people with at least a minimum degreeof coherent form. 
 In the broad sense it signifies the sum of such nucleiunited into a whole. 
 For example, the navy, the army, or the state is at one and the same time a sum of organisations (in the narrow sense of the word) and a variety of social organisation (in the broad senseof the word). 
 The Department of Education is an organisation (inthe broad sense of the word) and consists of a number of organisations(in the narrow sense of the word). 
 Similarly, the Party is an organisa-the concepts party and organisation? Of course not. 
 I thereby express clearly and precisely my wish, my demand, that the Party, as the vanguard of the class, should be as organised as possible, that the Party should admit to its ranks onlysuch elements as allow of at least a minimum of organisation . 
 My opponent, on the contrary, lumps together in the Party organised and unorganised elements, those who lend them-selves to direction and those who do not, the advanced and the incorrigibly backward—for the corrigibly backward can join an organisation. 
 This confusio n is indeed dangerous . 
 Comrade Axelrod further cited the “strictly secret and central-ised organisations of the past” (Zemlya i Volya 96 and Na-rodnaya Volya97): around them, he said, “were grouped a large number of people who did not belong to the organisation but who helped it in one way or another and who were regard-ed as Party members.... 
 This principle should be even morestrictly observed in the Social-Democratic organisation. 
”Here we come to one of the key points of the matter: is “this principle” really a Social-Democratic one—this prin-ciple which allows people who do not belong to any of the organisations of the Party, but only “help it in one way or another”, to call themselves Party members? And Plekhanovgave the only possible reply to this question when he said:“Axelrod was wrong in citing the seventies. 
 At that timethere was a well-organised and splendidly disciplined centre;around it there were the organisations of various categories, which it had created; and what remained outside these orga-nisations was chaos, anarchy. 
 The component elements ofthis chaos called themselves Party members, but this harmedrather than benefited the cause. 
 We should not imitate theanarchy of the seventies, but avoid it. 
” Thus “this princi-ple”, which Comrade Axelrod wanted to pass off as a Social-Democratic one, is in reality an anarchistic principle . 
 To tion, should be an organisation (in the broad sense of the word); at the same time, the Party should consist of a whole number of diversified organisations (in the narrow sense of the word). 
 Therefore, when he spoke of drawing a distinction between the concepts party and orga-nisation, Comrade Axelrod, firstly, did not take account of the differ-ence between the broad and the narrow sense of the word “organisa-tion”, and, secondly, did not observe that he was himself confusing organised and unorganised elements. 
 refute this, one would have to show that control, direction, and discipline are possible outside an organisation, and that conferring the title of Party members on “elements of chaos” is necessary . 
 The supporters of Comrade Martov’s formulation did not show, and could not show, either of these things. 
 Com-rade Axelrod took as an example “a professor who regardshimself as a Social-Democrat and declares himself such”. 
To complete the thought contained in this example, Comrade Axelrod should have gone on to tell us whether the organised Social-Democrats themselves regard this professor as a So-cial-Democrat. 
 By failing to raise this further question,Comrade Axelrod abandoned his argument half-way. 
 Afterall, one thing or the other. 
 Either the organised Social-Dem-ocrats regard the professor in question as a Social-Democrat, in which case why should they not enrol him in one of the Social-Democratic organisations? For only if the professor isthus enrolled will his “declaration” answer to his actions, andnot be empty talk (as professorial declarations all too fre-quently are). 
 Or the organised Social-Democrats do not regard the professor as a Social-Democrat, in which case it would be absurd, senseless and harmful to allow him the right to bear the honourable and responsible title of Partymember. 
 The matter therefore reduces itself to the alterna-tive: consistent application of the principle of organisation,or the sanctification of disunity and anarchy? Are we to buildthe Party on the basis of that already formed and welded core of Social-Democrats which brought about the Party Congress, for instance, and which should enlarge and mul-tiply Party organisations of all kinds; or are we to contentourselves with the soothing phrase that all who help are Party members? “If we adopt Lenin’s formula,” ComradeAxelrod continued, “we shall be throwing overboard a sec-tion of those who, even if they cannot be directly admitted to an organisation, are nevertheless Party members. 
” The con-fusion of concepts of which Comrade Axelrod wanted to accuseme stands out here quite clearly in his own case: he alreadytakes it for granted that all who help are Party members, whereas that is what the whole argument is about and our opponents have still to prove the necessity and value of such an interpretation. 
 What is the meaning of the phrase“throwing overboard”, which at first glance seems so terri-ble? Even if only members of organisations recognised as Party organisations are regarded as Party members, people who cannot “directly” join any Party organisation can still work in an organisation which does not belong to the Partybut is associated with it. 
 Consequently, there can be no talkof throwing anyone overboard in the sense of preventing themfrom working, from taking part in the movement. 
 On the con-trary, the stronger our Party organisations, consisting of real Social-Democrats, the less wavering and instability there is within the Party, the broader, more varied, richer, and more fruitful will be the Party’s influence on the elements ofthe working-class masses surrounding it and guided by it. 
 The Party, as the vanguard of the working class, must not be con-fused, after all, with the entire class. 
 And Comrade Axelrod is guilty of just this confusion (which is characteristic of our opportunist Economism in general) when he says: “First andforemost we are, of course, creating an organisation of themost active elements of the Party, an organisation of revo-lutionaries; but since we are the Party of a class, we musttake care not to leave outside the Party ranks people who consciously, though perhaps not very actively, associate themselves with that Party. 
” Firstly, the active elements ofthe Social-Democratic working-class party will includenot only organisations of revolutionaries, but a whole number of workers’ organisations recognised as Party organisations. 
Secondly, how, by what logic, does the fact that we are the party of a class warrant the conclusion that it is unneces-sary to make a distinction between those who belong to the Party and those who associate themselves with it? Just the contrary: precisely because there are differences in degree ofconsciousness and degree of activity, a distinction must bemade in degree of proximity to the Party. 
 We are the party of a class, and therefore almost the entire class (and in times of war, in a period of civil war, the entire class) should actunder the leadership of our Party, should adhere to our Par-ty as closely as possible. 
 But it would be Manilovism 98 and “tail-ism” to think that the entire class, or almost theentire class, can ever rise, under capitalism, to the level of consciousness and activity of its vanguard, of its Social-Democratic Party. 
 No sensible Social-Democrat has everdoubted that under capitalism even the trade union orga-nisations (which are more primitive and more comprehensi-ble to the undeveloped sections) are incapable of embracing the entire, or almost the entire, working class. 
 To forget the distinction between the vanguard and the whole of themasses gravitating towards it, to forget the vanguard’sconstant duty of raising ever wider sections to its own ad-vanced level, means simply to deceive oneself, to shut one’seyes to the immensity of our tasks, and to narrow down these tasks. 
 And it is just such a shutting of one’s eyes, it is just such forgetfulness, to obliterate the difference between thosewho associate themselves and those who belong, those whoare conscious and active and those who only help. 
 To argue that we are the party of a class in justification of organisational looseness, in justification of confusing organisation with disorganisation, is to repeat the mistake of Nadezhdin, who confused “the philosophical and social-historical question of the ‘depth’ of the ‘roots’ of the move-ment with the technical and organisational question” ( What Is To Be Done? , p. 
 91). 
 * It is this confusion, wrought by the deft hand of Comrade Axelrod, that was then repeated dozens of times by the speakers who defended Comrade Mar-tov’s formulation. 
 “The more widespread the title of Partymember, the better,” said Martov, without, however, explain-ing the benefit of a widespread title which did not corres-pond to fact. 
 Can it be denied that control over Party mem-bers who do not belong to a Party organisation is a mere fiction? A widespread fiction is not beneficial, but harmful. 
 “We could only rejoice if every striker, every demonstrator,answering for his actions, could proclaim himself a Partymember” (p. 
 239). 
 Is that so? Every striker should have the right to proclaim himself a Party member ? In this statement Comrade Martov instantly carries his mistake to the point of absurdity, by lowering Social-Democracy to the level of mere strike-making, thereby repeating the misadventures of theAkimovs. 
 We could only rejoice if the Social-Democratssucceeded in directing every strike, for it is their plain andunquestionable duty to direct every manifestation of theclass struggle of the proletariat, and strikes are one of the most profound and most powerful manifestations of that *See present edition, Vol. 
 5, p. 
 460. 
— Ed. 
 struggle. 
 But we should be tail-enders if we were to identify this primary form of struggle, which ipso facto is no more than a trade unionist form, with the all-round and conscious So-cial-Democratic struggle. 
 We should be opportunisticallylegitimising a patent falsehood if we were to allow every strik-er the right to “proclaim himself a Party member”, for inthe majority of cases such a “proclamation” would be false . 
 We should be indulging in complacent daydreaming if we tried to assure ourselves and others that every striker can be a Social-Democrat and a member of the Social-Democratic Party, in face of that infinite disunity, oppression, and stul-tification which under capitalism is bound to weigh downupon such very wide sections of the “untrained”, unskilledworkers. 
 This example of the “ striker ” brings out with par-ticular clarity the difference between the revolutionary striving to direct every strike in a Social-Democratic way and the opportunist phrase-mongering which proclaims every striker a Party member. 
 We are the Party of a class inasmuch as we in fact direct almost the entire, or even the entire, proletarian class in a Social-Democratic way; but only Akimovs can conclude from this that we must in word identify the Party and the class. 
 “I am not afraid of a conspiratorial organisation,” said Comrade Martov in this same speech; but, he added, “forme a conspiratorial organisation has meaning only when itis enveloped by a broad Social-Democratic working-class party” (p. 
 239). 
 To be exact he should have said: when it is enveloped by a broad Social-Democratic working-classmovement . 
 And in that form Comrade Martov’s proposition would have been not only indisputable, but a plain truism. 
I dwell on this point only because subsequent speakersturned Comrade Martov’s truism into the very prevalent and very vulgar argument that Lenin wants “to confine the sum-total of Party members to the sum-total of conspirators”. 
This conclusion, which can only provoke a smile, was drawnboth by Comrade Posadovsky and by Comrade Popov; andwhen it was taken up by Martynov and Akimov, its truecharacter of an opportunist phrase became altogether mani-fest. 
 Today Comrade Axelrod is developing this same argu-ment in the new Iskra by way of acquainting the reading public with the new editorial board’s new views on organi-sation. 
 Already at the Congress, at the very first sitting where Paragraph 1 was discussed, I noticed that our opponents wanted to avail themselves of this cheap weapon, and therefore warned in my speech (p. 
 240): “It should not beimagined that Party organisations must consist solely ofprofessional revolutionaries. 
 We need the most diverse orga-nisations of all types, ranks, and shades, beginning withextremely limited and secret and ending with very broad, free, lose Organisationen . 
” This is such an obvious and self-evident truth that I did not think it necessary to dwell on it. 
But today, when we have been dragged back in so many re-spects, one has to “repeat old lessons” on this subject too. 
In order to do so, I shall quote certain passages from What Is To Be Done? and A Letter to a Comrade . 
 “...A circle of leaders of the type of Alexeyev and Myshkin, of Khalturin and Zhelyabov, is capable of coping with polit-ical tasks in the genuine and most practical sense of theterm, for the reason and to the extent that their impassionedpropaganda meets with response among the spontaneouslyawakening masses, and their sparkling energy is answered and supported by the energy of the revolutionary class. 
” * In order to be a Social-Democratic party , we must win the support precisely of the class . 
 It is not that the Party should envelop the conspiratorial organisation, as Comrade Martovthought, but that the revolutionary class, the proletariat,should envelop the Party, the latter to include both conspir-atorial and non-conspiratorial organisations. 
 “...The workers’ organisations for the economic struggle should be trade union organisations. 
 Every Social-Demo-cratic worker should as far as possible assist and activelywork in these organisations. 
 But ... it is certainly not in ourinterest to demand that only Social-Democrats should be eligible for membership in the trade unions since that would only narrow the scope of our influence upon the masses. 
 Letevery worker who understands the need to unite for the strug-gle against the employers and the government join the tradeunions. 
 The very aim of the trade unions would be impossibleof achievement if they did not unite all who have attained at least this elementary degree of understanding—if they *See present edition, Vol. 
 5, p. 
 447. 
— Ed. 
 were not very broad organisations. 
 The broader these organi-sations, the broader will be our influence over them—an influence due, not only to the ‘spontaneous’ development of the economic struggle, but to the direct and conscious effortof the socialist trade union members to influence their com-rades” (p. 
 86). 
 * Incidentally, the example of the trade unions is particularly significant for an assessment of the contro-versial question of Paragraph 1. 
 That these unions should work “under the control and direction” of the Social-Demo-cratic organisations, of that there can be no two opinionsamong Social-Democrats. 
 But on those grounds to confer on all members of trade unions the right to “proclaim them-selves” members of the Social-Democratic Party would be anobvious absurdity and would constitute a double danger: on the one hand, of narrowing the dimensions of the trade union movement and thus weakening the solidarity of the workers;and, on the other, of opening the door of the Social-Demo-cratic Party to vagueness and vacillation. 
 The German So-cial-Democrats had occasion to solve a similar problemin a practical instance, in the celebrated case of the Ham-burg bricklayers working on piece rates. 
 99 The Social-Democrats did not hesitate for a moment to proclaim strike-breaking dishonourable in Social-Democratic eyes, that is,to acknowledge that to direct and support strikes was their own vital concern; but at the same time they just as resolute-ly rejected the demand for identifying the interests of the Party with the interests of the trade unions, for making the Party responsible for individual acts of individual trade unions. 
 The Party should and will strive to imbue thetrade unions with its spirit and bring them under its in-fluence; but precisely in order to do so it must distinguishthe fully Social-Democratic elements in these unions (the elements belonging to the Social-Democratic Party) from those which are not fully class-conscious and politicallyactive, and not confuse the two, as Comrade Axelrod wouldhave us do. 
 “...Centralisation of the most secret functions in an orga-nisation of revolutionaries will not diminish, but rather increase the extent and enhance the quality of the activity *See present edition, Vol. 
 5, p. 
 454. 
— Ed. 
 of a large number of other organisations that are intended for a broad public and are therefore as loose and as non-secret as possible, such as workers’ trade unions; workers’ self-education circles and circles for reading illegal literature;and socialist, as well as democratic, circles among all other sections of the population; etc. 
, etc. 
 We must have such cir-cles, trade unions, and organisations everywhere in as large a number as possible and with the widest variety of functions-but it would be absurd and harmful to confound them with the organisation of revolutionaries , to efface the border-line between them...” (p. 
 96). 
 * This quotation shows how out of place it was for Comrade Martov to remind methat the organisation of revolutionaries should be enveloped by broad organisations of workers. 
 I had already pointed this out in What Is To Be Done? — and in A Letter to a Comrade I developed this idea more concretely. 
 Factory circles, I wrote there, “are particularly important to us: the mainstrength of the movement lies in the organisation of the work-ers at the large factories, for the large factories (and mills) contain not only the predominant part of the working class, as regards numbers, but even more as regards influence, de-velopment, and fighting capacity. 
 Every factory must be ourfortress.... 
 The factory subcommittee should endeavourto embrace the whole factory, the largest possible numberof the workers, with a network of all kinds of circles (oragents).... 
 All groups, circles, subcommittees, etc. 
, should enjoy the status of committee institutions or branches of a committee. 
 Some of them will openly declare their wishto join the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party and,if endorsed by the committee, will join the Party, and will assume definite functions (on the instructions of, or in agree-ment with, the committee), will undertake to obey the orders of the Party organs, receive the same rights as all Party mem-bers , and be regarded as immediate candidates for mem-bership of the committee, etc. 
 Others will not join the R.

, and will have the status of circles formed by Party members, or associated with one Party group or anoth-er, etc. 
” (pp. 
 17-18). 
 ** The words I have underlined make *See present edition, Vol. 
 5, p. 
 466. 
— Ed. 
 **See present edition, Vol. 
 6, pp. 
 241, 243, 244. 
— Ed. 
 it particularly clear that the idea of my formulation of Para-grah 1 was already fully expressed in A Letter to a Com-rade . 
 The conditions for joining the Party are directly indi-cated there, namely: 1) a certain degree of organisation, and 2) endorsement by a Party committee. 
 A page later I roughly indicate also what groups and organisations should (or should not) be admitted to the Party, and for what rea-sons: “The distributing groups should belong to the R.

 Groups of students, officers, or office employees engaged in self-education in conjunction with one or two Party members should in some cases not even be aware that these belong to the Party, etc. 
” (pp. 
 18-19). 
 * There you have additional material on the subject of the “open visor”! Whereas the formula of Comrade Martov’s draft does not even touch on relations between the Party and the organisations, I pointed out nearly a year before the Congress that some organisations should belong to the Party, and others not. 
 In A Letter to a Comrade the idea I advocated at the Congress was already clearly outlined. 
 The matter might be put graphically in the following way. 
 Depending on degree of organisation in general and of secrecy of organi-sation in particular, roughly the following categories may be distinguished: 1) organisations of revolutionaries; 2) orga-nisations of workers, as broad and as varied as possible (I confine myself to the working class, taking it as self-evident that, under certain conditions, certain elements of other classes will also be included here). 
 These two catego-ries constitute the Party. 
 Further, 3) workers’ organisations associated with the Party; 4) workers’ organisations not associated with the Party but actually under its control and direction; 5) unorganised elements of the working class, who in part also come under the direction of the Social-Democratic Party, at any rate during big manifestations of the class struggle. 
 That, approximately, is how the matter presents itself to me. 
 As Comrade Martov sees it, on the *See present edition, Vol. 
 6, p. 
 245. 
 —Ed. 
 contrary, the border-line of the Party remains absolutely vague, for “every striker” can “proclaim himself a Party member”. 
 What benefit is there in this looseness? A wide-spread “title”. 
 Its harm is that it introduces a disorganising idea, the confusing of class and party. 
 In illustration of the general propositions we have ad-duced, let us take a cursory glance at the further discussion of Paragraph 1 at the Congress. 
 Comrade Brouckère (to the great glee of Comrade Martov) pronounced in favour of my formulation, but his alliance with me, unlike Comrade Aki-mov’s with Martov, turned out to be based on a misunder-standing. 
 Comrade Brouckère did “not agree with the Rules as a whole, with their entire spirit” (p. 
 239), and defended my formulation as the basis of the democracy which the supporters of Rabocheye Dyelo desired. 
 Comrade Brouckère had not yet risen to the view that in a political struggle it is sometimes necessary to choose the lesser evil ; Comrade Brouckère did not realise that it was useless to advocate democracy at a Congress like ours. 
 Comrade Akimov was more perspicacious. 
 He put the question quite rightly when he stated that “Comrades Martov and Lenin are arguing as to which [for-mulation] will best achieve their common aim” (p. 
 252); “Brouckère and I,” he continued, “want to choose the one which will least achieve that aim . 
 From this angle I choose Martov’s formulation. 
” And Comrade Akimov frankly explain-ed that he considered “their very aim” (that is, the aim of Plekhanov, Martov, and myself—the creation of a directing organisation of revolutionaries) to be “impracticable and harmful”; like Comrade Martynov, * he advocated the Econ-omist idea that “an organisation of revolutionaries” was *Comrade Martynov, it is true, wanted to be different from Com-rade Akimov, he wanted to show that conspiratorial did not mean secret, that behind the two different words were two different con-cepts. 
 What the difference is, neither Comrade Martynov nor Com-rade Axelrod, who is now following in his footsteps, ever did explain. 
 Comrade Martynov “acted” as if I had not—for example in What Is To Be Done? (as well as in the Tasks [see present edition, Vol. 
 2, pp. 
 323-51. 
— Ed. 
])—resolutely opposed “ confining the political struggle to conspiracy”. 
 Comrade Martynov was anxious to have his hearers forget that the people I had been fighting had not seen any necessity for an organisation of revolutionaries , just as Comrade Akimov did not see it now. 
 unnecessary. 
 He was “confident that in the end the realities of life will force their way into our Party organisation, wheth-er you bar their path with Martov’s formulation or with Lenin’s”. 
 It would not be worth while dwelling on this “tail-ist” conception of the “realities of life” if we did not encoun-ter it in the case of Comrade Martov too. 
 In general, ComradeMartov’s second speech (p. 
 245) is so interesting that it deser-ves to be examined in detail. 
 Comrade Martov’s first argument: control by the Party organisations over Party members not belonging to them“is practicable, inasmuch as, having assigned a function tosomeone, the committee will be able to watch over it”(p. 
 245). 
 This thesis is remarkably characteristic, for it“betrays”, if one may so put it, who needs Martov’s formula-tion and whom it will serve in actual fact —free-lance intellec-tuals or workers’ groups and the worker masses. 
 The factis that there are two possible interpretations of Martov’sformulation: 1) that anyone who renders the Party regularpersonal assistance under the direction of one of its organi-sations is entitled to “ proclaim himself ” (Comrade Martov’s own words) a Party member; 2) that a Party organisation is entitled to regard as a Party member anyone who renders it regular personal assistance under its direction. 
 It is only thefirst interpretation that really gives “every striker” theopportunity to call himself a Party member, and accordinglyit alone immediately won the hearts of the Liebers, Aki-movs, and Martynovs. 
 But this interpretation is manifestly no more than a phrase, because it would apply to the entireworking class, and the distinction between Party and classwould be obliterated; control over and direction of “everystriker” can only be spoken of “symbolically”. 
 That is why,in his second speech, Comrade Martov at once slipped into the second interpretation (even though, be it said in parenthe-sis, it was directly rejected by the Congress when it turned down Kostich’s resolution—p. 
 255), namely, that a commit-tee would assign functions and watch over their fulfilment. 
Such special assignments will never, of course, be made to themass of the workers, to the thousands of proletarians (of whom Comrade Axelrod and Comrade Martynov spoke)—they will frequently be given precisely to those professors whom Com-rade Axelrod mentioned, to those high-school students for whom Comrade Lieber and Comrade Popov were so concerned (p. 
 241), and to the revolutionary youth to whom Comrade Axelrod referred in his second speech (p. 
 242). 
 In a word, Comrade Martov’s formula will either remain a dead letter,an empty phrase, or it will be of benefit mainly and almostexclusively to “ intellectuals who are thoroughly imbued with bourgeois individualism ” and do not wish to join an organisa-tion. 
 In words , Martov’s formulation defends the interests of the broad strata of the proletariat, but in fact it serves the interests of the bourgeois intellectuals , who fight shy of proletarian discipline and organisation. 
 No one will ventureto deny that the intelligentsia , as a special stratum of modern capitalist society, is characterised, by and large, precisely by individualism and incapacity for discipline and organisa-tion (cf. 
, for example, Kautsky’s well-known articles on the intelligentsia). 
 This, incidentally is a feature which unfa-vourably distinguishes this social stratum from the proletar-iat; it is one of the reasons for the flabbiness and instabilityof the intellectual, which the proletariat so often feels;and this trait of the intelligentsia is intimately bound up with its customary mode of life, its mode of earning a live-lihood, which in a great many respects approximates to thepetty-bourgeois mode of existence (working in isolation or in very small groups, etc. 
). 
 Nor is it fortuitous, lastly, that thedefenders of Comrade Martov’s formulation were the oneswho had to cite the example of professors and high-school students! It was not champions of a broad proletarian strug-gle who, in the controversy over Paragraph 1, took the fieldagainst champions of a radically conspiratorial organisation,as Comrades Martynov and Axelrod thought, but the support-ers of bourgeois-intellectual individualism who clashed with the supporters of proletarian organisation and discipline . 
 Comrade Popov said: “Everywhere, in St. 
 Petersburg as in Nikolayev or Odessa, as the representatives from thesetowns testify, there are dozens of workers who are distrib-uting literature and carrying on word-of-mouth agitation butwho cannot be members of an organisation. 
 They can beattached to an organisation, but not regarded as members” (p. 
 241). 
 Why they cannot be members of an organisation remained Comrade Popov’s secret. 
 I have already quoted thepassage from A Letter to a Comrade showing that the admis-sion of all such workers (by the hundred, not the dozen) to an organisation is both possible and necessary, and, more-over, that a great many of these organisations can and should belong to the Party. 
 Comrade Martov’s second argument: “In Lenin’s opinion there should be no organisations in the Party other than Par-ty organisations.... 
” Quite true! “In my opinion, on the con-trary, such organisations should exist. 
 Life creates and breeds organizations faster than we can include them in the hierar-chy of our militant organisation of professional revolution-aries.... 
” That is untrue in two respects: 1) the number ofeffective organisations of revolutionaries that “life” breedsis far less than we need, than the working-class movementrequires; 2) our Party should be a hierarchy not only of or-ganisations of revolutionaries, but of a mass of workers’ or-ganisations as well.... 
 “Lenin thinks that the Central Commit-tee will confer the title of Party organisations only on suchas are fully reliable in the matter of principles. 
 But Com-rade Brouckère understands very well that life [ sic!] will assert itself and that the Central Committee, in order not to leave a multitude of organisations outside the Party, will have to legitimise them despite their not quite reliable char-acter; that is why Comrade Brouckère associates himselfwith Lenin.... 
” What a truly tail-ist conception of “life”!Of course, if the Central Committee had necessarily to con-sist of people who were not guided by their own opinions, but by what others might say ( vide the Organising Commit-tee incident), then “life” would “assert itself” in the sense that the most backward elements in the Party would gain theupper hand ( as has in fact happened now when the backward elements have taken shape as the Party “minority ”. 
). 
 But no intelligent reason can be given which would induce a sensible Central Committee to admit “unreliable” elements to the Party. 
 By this reference to “life”, which “breeds” unreliable elements, Comrade Martov patently revealed the opportunistcharacter of his plan of organisation!... “I for my part think,” he continued, “that if such an organisation [one that is not quite reliable] is prepared to accept the Party programme andParty control, we may admit it to the Party, without thereby making it a Party organisation. 
 I would consider it a great triumph for our Party if, for example some union of ‘independents’ were to declare that they accepted the views of Social-Democracy and its programme and were joining the Party; which does not, however, mean that we would include the union in the Party organisation.... 
” Such is the muddleMartov’s formulation leads to: non-Party organisations be-longing to the Party! Just imagine his scheme: the Party = 1) organisations of revolutionaries, $2) workers’ organisa-tions recognised as Party organisations, $3) workers’ orga-nisations not recognised as Party organisations (consisting principally of “independents”), $4) individuals performing various functions—professors, high-school students, etc. 
,$5) “every striker”. 
 Alongside of this remarkable plan one can only put the words of Comrade Lieber: “Our taskis not only to organise an organisation [!!]; we can and should organise a party” (p. 
 241). 
 Yes, of course, we can and should do that, but what it requires is not meaningless words about“organising organisations”, but the unequivocal demand that Party members should work to create an organisation i n fact. 
 He who talks about “organising a party” and yet de-fends using the word party to cover disorganisation and disunity of every kind is just indulging in empty words. 
 “Our formulation,” Comrade Martov said, “expresses the desire to have a series of organisations between the organi-sation of revolutionaries and the masses. 
” It does not. 
 Thistruly essential desire is just what Martov’s formulation does not express , for it does not offer an incentive to organise , does not contain a demand for organisation, does not separate organised from unorganised. 
 All it offers is a title, * and in this *At the League Congress, Comrade Martov adduced one more argument in support of his formulation, an argument that deservesto be laughed at. 
 “We might point out,” he said, “that, taken literally,Lenin’s formulation excludes the agents of the Central Committee from the Party, for they do not constitute an organisation” (p. 
 59). 
 Even at the League Congress this argument was greeted with laughter , as the minutes record. 
 Comrade Martov supposes that the “difficulty”he mentions can only be solved by including the Central Committeeagents in “the organisation of the Central Committee”. 
 But that isnot the point. 
 The point is that Comrade Martov’s example saliently demonstrates that he completely fails to understand the idea of Para-graph 1 ; it was a sheer specimen of pedantic criticism that did indeed deserve to be laughed at. 
 Formally speaking , all that would be required would be to form an “organisation of Central Committee agents”,pass a resolution to include it in the Party, and the “difficulty” which connection we cannot but recall Comrade Axelrod’s words: “No decree can forbid them [circles of revolutionary youth and the like] or individuals to call themselves Social-Demo-crats [true enough!] and even to regard themselves as part ofthe Party”—now that is not true at all ! It is impossible and pointless to forbid anyone to call himself a Social-Democrat, for in its direct sense this word only signifies a system of con-victions, and not definite organisational relations. 
 But as to forbidding various circles and persons to “regard themselves as part of the Party”, that can and should be done if thesecircles and persons injure the Party, corrupt or disorganiseit. 
 It would be absurd to speak of the Party as of a whole, as of a political entity, if it could not “by decree forbid”a circle to “regard itself as part” of the whole! What in that case would be the point of defining the procedure and condi-tions of expulsion from the Party? Comrade Axelrod reducedComrade Martov’s fundamental mistake to an obvious absur-dity; he even elevated this mistake to an opportunist theory when he added: “As formulated by Lenin, Paragraph 1 di-rectly conflicts in principle with the very nature [!!] and aims of the Social-Democratic Party of the proletariat” (p. 
 243). 
 This means nothing less than that making higherdemands of the Party than of the class conflicts in principlewith the very nature of the aims of the proletariat. 
 It is notsurprising that Akimov was heart and soul in favour of sucha theory . 
 It should be said in fairness that Comrade Axelrod—who now wants to convert this mistaken formulation, one obvious-caused Comrade Martov so much brain-racking would immediately vanish. 
 The idea of Paragraph 1 as formulated by me consists in the incentive to organise; it consists in guaranteeing actual control and direction. 
 Essentially , the very question whether the Central Commit-tee agents will belong to the Party is ridiculous, for actual control over them is fully and absolutely guaranteed by the very fact that they have been appointed agents and that they are kept on as agents. 
 Con-sequently, here there can be no question of any confusion of organisedand unorganised (which is the root mistake in Comrade Martov’s for-mulation). 
 Why Comrade Martov’s formulation is no good is that itallows anyone, any opportunist, any windbag, any “professor”, and any “high-school student” to proclaim himself a Party member. 
 It is in vain for Comrade Martov to try to talk away this Achilles heel of hi s formulation by examples in which there can be no question of peoplearbitrarily styling or proclaiming themselves members. 
 ly tending towards opportunism, into the germ of new views —at the Congress, on the contrary, expressed a readiness to “bargain”, saying: “But I observe that I am knocking at an open door” (I observe this in the new Iskra too), “because Comrade Lenin, with his peripheral circles which are to beregarded as part of the Party organisation, goes out to meetmy demand. 
” (And not only with the peripheral circles, butwith every kind of workers’ union: cf. 
 p. 
 242 of the Minutes, the speech of Comrade Strakhov, and the passages from What Is To Be Done? and A Letter to a Comrade quoted above. 
) “There still remain the individuals, but here, too, we couldbargain. 
” I replied to Comrade Axelrod that, generally speak-ing, I was not averse to bargaining, and I must now explainin what sense this was meant. 
 As regards the individuals— all those professors, high-school students, etc. 
—I would least of all have agreed to make concessions; but if doubts had beenaroused as to the workers’ organisations, I would have agreed(despite the utter groundlessness of such doubts, as I haveproved above) to add to my Paragraph 1 a note to the follow-ing effect: “Workers’ organisations which accept the Pro-gramme and Rules of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party should be included in the largest possible numbersamong the Party organisations. 
” Strictly speaking, of course,the place for such a recommendation is not in the Rules,which should be confined to statutory definitions, but inexplanatory commentaries and pamphlets (and I have already pointed out that I gave such explanations in my pam-phlets long before the Rules were drawn up); but at least sucha note would not contain even a shadow of wrong ideas capa-ble of leading to disorganisation, not a shadow of the oppor-tunist arguments * and “ anarchistic conceptions ” that are un-doubtedly inherent in Comrade Martov’s formulation. 
 *To this category of arguments, which inevitably crop up when attempts are made to justify Martov’s formulation, belongs, in par-ticular, Comrade Trotsky’s statement (pp. 
 248 and 346) that “oppor-tunism is produced by more complex [or: is determined by deeper]causes than one or another clause in the Rules; it is brought about bythe relative level of development of bourgeois democracy and the pro-letariat.... 
” The point is not that clauses in the Rules may produce opportunism, but that with their help a more or a less trenchantweapon against opportunism can be forged. 
 The deeper its causes,the more trenchant should this weapon be. 
 Therefore, to justify a for-This last expression, given by me in quotation marks, is that of Comrade Pavlovich, who quite justly characterised as anarchism the recognition of “ irresponsible and self-enrolled Party members”. 
 “Translated into simple terms,” said Com-rade Pavlovich, explaining my formulation to ComradeLieber, “it means: ‘if you want to be a Party member, youracceptance of organisational relations too must be not mere-ly platonic’. 
” Simple as this “translation” was, it seems mulation which opens the door to opportunism on the grounds that opportunism has deep causes” is tail-ism of the first water. 
 When Comrade Trotsky was opposed to Comrade Lieber, he understood that the Rules constitute the organised distrust” of the whole towards thepart, of the vanguard towards the backward contingent; but when Comrade Trotsky came to be on Comrade Lieber’s side, he forgot this and even began to justify the weakness and instability of our organi-sation of this distrust (distrust of opportunism) by talking about “com-plex causes”, the “level of development of the proletariat”, etc. 
 Here is another of Comrade Trotsky’s arguments: “It is much easier forthe intellectual youth, organised in one way or another, to enter them-selves [my italics] on the rolls of the Party. 
” Just so. 
 That is why it is the formulation by which even unorganised elements may proclaim themselves Party members that suffers from intellectualist vagueness, and not my formulation, which obviates the right to “enter oneself ” on the rolls. 
 Comrade Trotsky said that if the Central Committee“refused to recognise” an organisation of opportunists, it would only be because of the character of certain individuals, and that since these individuals would be known, as political personalities, they wouldnot be dangerous and could be removed by a general Party boycott. 
 This is only true of cases when people have to be removed from the Party (and only half true at that, because an organised party removes members by a vote and not by a boycott). 
 It is absolutely untrue of the far more frequent cases when removal would be absurd, and when all that is required is control . 
 For purposes of control, the Central Com-mittee might, on certain conditions, deliberately admit to the Party an organisation which was not quite reliable but which was capable of working; it might do so with the object of testing it, of trying todirect it on to the right path , of correcting its partial aberrations by guidance, etc. 
 This would not be dangerous if in general “ self-entering ” on the Party rolls were not allowed. 
 It would often be useful for anopen and responsible , controlled expression (and discussion) of mistak-en views and mistaken tactics. 
 “But if statutory definitions are to correspond to actual relations, Comrade Lenin’s formulation must berejected,” said Comrade Trotsky, and again he spoke like an opportun-ist. 
 Actual relations are not a dead thing, they live and develop. 
 Statutory definitions may correspond to the progressive developmentof those relations, but they may also (if the definitions are bad ones) “correspond” to retrogression or stagnation. 
 The latter case is the “case” of Comrade Martov. 
 it was not superfluous (as events since the Congress have shown) not only for various dubious professors and high-school students, but for honest-to-goodness Party members, for people at the top.... 
 With no less justice, Comrade Pav-lovich pointed to the contradiction between Comrade Mar-tov’s formulation and the indisputable precept of scientificsocialism which Comrade Martov quoted so unhappily:“Our Party is the conscious spokesman of an unconscious process. 
” Exactly. 
 And for that very reason it is wrong to want “every striker” to have the right to call himself a Party member, for if “every strike” were not only a spontaneous ex-pression of the powerful class instinct and of the class strug-gle which is leading inevitably to the social revolution, but a conscious expression of that process, then ... then the general strike would not be an anarchist phrase, then our Partywould forthwith and at once embrace the whole working class, and, consequently, would at once put an end to bourgeois society as a whole . 
 If it is to be a conscious spokesman in fact, the Party must be able to work out organisational relations that will ensure a definite level of consciousness and systematically raise this level. 
 “If we are to go the way ofMartov,” Comrade Pavlovich said, “we should first of all delete the clause on accepting the programme , for before a programme can be accepted it must be mastered and under-stood.... 
 Acceptance of the programme presupposes a fairly high level of political consciousness. 
” We shall never allow support of Social-Democracy, participation in the struggle it directs, to be artificially restricted by any requirements (mastery, understanding, etc. 
), for this participation itself, the very fact of it, promotes both consciousness and the instinct for organisation; but since we have joined together in a party to carry on systematic work, we must see to it that it is systematic. 
 That Comrade Pavlovich’s warning regarding the programme was not superfluous became apparent at once , during that very same sitting. 
 Comrades Akimov and Lieber, who secured the adoption of Comrade Martov’s formulation, * at once *The vote was twenty-eight for and twenty-two against. 
 Of the eight anti-Iskra -ists, seven were for Martov and one for me. 
 Without the aid of the opportunists, Comrade Martov would not have secured betrayed their true nature by demanding (pp. 
 254-55) that in the case of the programme too only platonic ac-ceptance, acceptance only of its “basic principles”, should be required (for “membership” in the Party). 
 “Comrade Aki-mov’s proposal is quite logical from Comrade Martov’sstandpoint,” Comrade Pavlovich remarked. 
 Unfortunately,we cannot see from the minutes how many votes this proposal of Akimov’s secured—in all probability, not less than seven (five Bundists, Akimov, and Brouckère). 
 And it was the with-drawal of seven delegates from the Congress that converted the “compact majority” (anti-Iskra -ists, “Centre”, and Mar-tovites) which began to form over Paragraph 1 of the Rulesinto a compact minority! It was the withdrawal of seven delegates that resulted in the defeat of the motion to endorse the old editorial board—that supposed howling violation of “continuity” in the Iskra editorship! A curious seven it was that constituted the sole salvation and guarantee of Iskra “continuity”: the Bundists, Akimov and Brouckère, thatis, the very delegates who voted against the motives for adopting Iskra as the Central Organ, the very delegates whose opportunism was acknowledged dozens of times by the Congress, and acknowledged in particular by Martov andPlekhanov in the matter of toning down Paragraph 1 in ref-erence to the programme. 
 The “continuity” of Iskra guarded by the anti-Iskra -ists!—this brings us to the starting-point of the post-Congress tragicomedy. 
 * * * The grouping of votes over Paragraph 1 of the Rules revealed a phenomenon of exactly the same type as the equality of languages incident: the falling away of one-quarter (approximately) of the Iskra majority made possible the victory of the anti-Iskra -ists, who were backed by the adoption of his opportunist formulation. 
 (At the League Congress Comrade Martov tried very unsuccessfully to refute this undoubted fact, for some reason mentioning only the votes of the Bundists andforgetting about Comrade Akimov and his friends—or rather remem-bering them only when it could serve against me: Comrade Brouckère’s agreement with me. 
) “Centre”. 
 Of course, here too there were individual votes which disturbed the full symmetry of the picture—in so large an assembly as our Congress there are bound to be some “strays” who shift quite fortuitously from one side to theother, especially on a question like Paragraph 1, where thetrue character of the divergence was only beginning to emergeand many delegates had simply not yet found their bearings (considering that the question had not been discussed before-hand in the press). 
 Five votes fell away from the majority Iskra -ists (Rusov and Karsky with two votes each, and Len-sky with one); on the other hand, they were joined by oneanti-Iskra -ist (Brouckère) and by three from the Centre (Medvedev, Egorov and Tsaryov); the result was a total oftwenty-three votes (24 —5&4), one vote less than in the final grouping in the elections. 
 It was the anti-“Iskra ”-ists who gave Martov his majority , seven of them voting for him and one for me (of the “Centre” too, seven voted for Martov,and three for me). 
 That coalition of the minority Iskra -ists with the anti-Iskra -ists and the “Centre” which formed a com-pact minority at the end of the Congress and after the Con-gress was beginning to take shape . 
 The political error of Mar-tov and Axelrod, who undoubtedly took a step towards oppor-tunism and anarchistic individualism in their formulation of Paragraph 1, and especially in their defence of that for-mulation, was revealed at once and very clearly thanks to thefree and open arena offered by the Congress; it was revealed in the fact that the least stable elements, the least steadfast in principle, at once employed all their forces to widen thefissure, the breach, that appeared in the views of the revolu-tionary Social-Democrats. 
 Working together at the Congresswere people who in matters of organisation frankly pursueddifferent aims (see Akimov’s speech)—a circumstance which at once induced those who were in principle opposed to our organisational plan and our Rules to support the error ofComrades Martov and Axelrod. 
 The Iskra -ists who on this question too remained faithful to the views of revolutionarySocial-Democracy found themselves in the minority . 
 This is a point of the utmost importance , for unless it is grasped it is absolutely impossible to understand either the struggle over the details of the Rules or the struggle over the personalcomposition of the Central Organ and the Central Committee. 
 J. 
 INNOCENT VICTIMS OF A FALSE ACCUSATION OF OPPORTUNISM Before passing onto the subsequent discussion of the Rules, it is necessary, in order to elucidate our difference over thepersonal composition of the central institutions, to touchon the private meetings of the Iskra organisation during the Congress. 
 The last and most important of these four meetings was held just after the vote on Paragraph 1 of the Rules— and thus the split in the Iskra organisation which took place at this meeting was in point of both time and logic a preludeto the subsequent struggle. 
 The Iskra organisation began to hold private meetings * soon after the Organising Committee incident, which gave rise to a discussion of possible candidates for the Central Committee. 
 It stands to reason that, since binding instructionshad been abolished, these meetings were purely in the natureof consultations and their decisions were not binding on any-one; but their importance was nevertheless immense. 
 Theselection of candidates for the Central Committee was a matter of considerable difficulty to delegates who were acquainted neither with the secret names nor with the innerwork of the Iskra organisation, the organisation that had brought about actual Party unity and whose leadership ofthe practical movement was one of the motives for theofficial adoption of Iskra . 
 We have already seen that, united, the Iskra -ists were fully assured a big majority at the Con-gress, as much as three-fifths, and all the delegates realisedthis very well. 
 All the Iskra -ists, in fact, expected the “Iskra ” organisation to make definite recommendations as to the personal composition of the Central Committee,and not one member of that organisation raised any objec-tion to a preliminary discussion of the Central Committee’s composition within it; not one of them so much as hintedat endorsing the entire membership of the OrganisingCommittee, that is, converting that body into the Central *I have already tried at the League Congress to give an account of what took place at the private meetings, keeping to the barest essen-tials in order to avoid hopeless arguments. 
 The principal facts arealso set out in my Letter to the Editors of “Iskra ” ( p. 
 4). 
 Comrade Martov did not challenge them in his Reply . 
 Committee, or even at conferring with the Organising Com-mittee as a whole regarding candidates for the Central Committee. 
 This circumstance is also highly significant, and it is extremely important to bear it in mind, for now , after the event , the Martovites are zealously defending the Organising Committee, thereby only proving their politicalspinelessness for the hundredth and thousandth time. 
 * Until the split over the composition of the central bodies led Martov to join forces with the Akimovs, everyone at the Congress clearly realised what any impartial personmay easily ascertain from the Congress minutes and fromthe entire history of Iskra , namely, that the Organising Committee was mainly a commission set up to convene the Congress, a commission deliberately composed of representa-tives of different shades, including even the Bundists; while the real work of creating the organised unity of the Party was done entirely by the Iskra organisation. 
 (It should be remembered also that quite by chance several Iskra -ists on the Organising Committee were absent from the Congress,either because they had been arrested or for other reasons “beyond their control”. 
) The members of the Iskra organi-sation present at the Congress have already been enumeratedin Comrade Pavlovich’s pamphlet (see his Letter on the Second Congress , p. 
 13). 
 100 The ultimate result of the heated debates in the Iskra organisation was the two votes I have already mentioned in my Letter to the Editors . 
 The first vote: “by nine votes to four, with three abstentions, one of the candidates supportedby Martov was rejected. 
” What could be simpler and morenatural, one would think, than such a fact: by the commonconsent of all the sixteen Iskra organisation members at the Congress, the possible candidates are discussed, and one of Comrade Martov’s candidates is rejected by the majority *Just reflect on this “picture of morals”: the delegate from the Iskra organisation confers at the Congress with it alone and does not hint , even, at conferring with the organising Committee. 
 But after he is defeated both in this organisation and at the Congress, he begins to regret that the Organising Committee was not endorsed, to extol it retrospectively, and loftily to ignore the organisation that gavehim his mandate! It may safely be vouched that no analogous instancewill be found in the history of any really Social-Democratic and reallyworking-class party. 
 (it was Comrade Stein, as Comrade Martov himself has now blurted out— State of Siege , p. 
 69). 
 After all, one of the reasons why we assembled at the Party Congress was to discuss and decide to whom to entrust the “conductor’sbaton”—and it was the common duty of us all as Partymembers to give this item on the agenda the most seriousattention, to decide this question from the standpoint of theinterests of the work , and not of “philistine sentimentality”, as Comrade Rusov quite rightly expressed it later. 
 Of course, in discussing candidates at the Congress , we were bound to touch upon certain personal qualities, were bound to expressour approval or disapproval, * especially at an unofficial and intimate meeting. 
 And I have already pointed out at the League Congress that it is absurd to think that a candidate is “disgraced” when he is not approved (League Minutes, p. 
 49), absurd to make a “scene” and go into hysterics overwhat forms part of a Party member’s direct duty to selectofficials conscientiously and judiciously. 
 And yet this waswhat put the fat in the fire as far as our minority are con-cerned, and they began after the Congress to clamour about “destroying reputations” (League Minutes, p. 
 70) and to as-sure the broad public in print that Comrade Stein had been the “chief figure” on the former Organising Committee andthat he had been groundlessly accused of “diabolical schemes”( State of Siege , p. 
 69). 
 Is it not hysterics to shout about “destroying reputations” in connection with the approval or disapproval of candidates? Is it not squabbling when people who have been defeated both at a private meeting of the *Comrade Martov bitterly complained at the League of the vehe-mence of my disapproval, failing to see that his complaint turned intoan argument against himself. 
 Lenin behaved—to use his own expres-sion—frenziedly (League Minutes, p. 
 63). 
 That is so. 
 He banged thedoor. 
 True. 
 His conduct (at the second or third meeting of the Iskra organisation) aroused the indignation of the members who remained at the meeting. 
 It did. 
 But what follows? Only that my arguments on the substance of the questions in dispute were convincing and wereborne out by the course of the Congress. 
 For if, in fact, nine of thesixteen members of the Iskra organisation in the end sided with me, clearly this was so notwithstanding and in spite of my reprehensible vehemence. 
 Hence, had it not been for this “vehemence”, perhaps even more than nine would have sided with me. 
 The more “indignation” my arguments and facts had to overcome, the more convincing theymust have been. 
 Iskra organisation and at the official supreme assembly of the Party, the Congress, begin to complain to all and sundry and recommend rejected candidates to the worthy public as “chief figures”, and when they then try to force theircandidates upon the Party by causing a split and demandingco-optation ? In our musty émigré atmosphere political con-cepts have become so confused that Comrade Martov is nolonger able to distinguish Party duty from personal and circle allegiance! It is bureaucracy and formalism, we are to believe, to think it proper to discuss and decide upon candi-dates only at congresses, where delegates assemble primarily for the discussion of important questions of principle, whererepresentatives of the movement assemble who are able totreat the question of personalities impartially, and who are able (and in duty bound) to demand and gather all necessary information about the candidates before casting their deci-sive votes, and where the assignment of a certain place toarguments over the conductor’s baton is natural and essen-tial. 
 Instead of this bureaucratic and formal view, newusages and customs have now become the thing: we are, after congresses, to talk right and left about the political burial of Ivan Ivanovich or the destroyed reputation of Ivan Ni-kiforovich; writers are to recommend candidates in pam-phlets, the while beating their breasts and hypocriticallyasserting: “This is not a circle, it is a party.... 
” Those ofthe reading public who have a taste for scandal will eagerly savour the sensational news that, on the assurance of Mar-tov himself, * so-and-so was the chief figure on the Organis-ing Committee. 
 This reading public is far more competentto discuss and decide the question than formalistic institu-tions like congresses, with their grossly mechanical decisionsby majority vote.... 
 Yes, there are still veritable Augean stables of émigré squabbling for our real Party workers to clean up! *I, too, like Martov, tried in the Iskra organisation to get acer-tain candidate nominated to the Central Committee and failed, acandidate of whose splendid reputation before and at the beginning of the Congress, as borne out by outstanding facts, I too could speak. 
 But it has never entered my head. 
 This comrade has sufficient self-respect not to allow anybody, after the Congress, to nominate him in print or to complain about political burials, destroyed reputations, etc. 
 Second vote of the Iskra organisation: “by ten votes to two, with four abstentions, a list of five [candidates for the Central Committee] was adopted which, on my proposal, included one leader of the non-Iskra -ist elements and one leader of the Iskra -ist minority. 
” * This vote is of the utmost importance, for it clearly and irrefutably proves the utterfalsity of the fables which were built up later, in the atmo-sphere of squabbling, to the effect that we wanted to eject the non-Iskra -ists from the Party or set them aside, that what the majority did was to pick candidates from onlyone half of the Congress and have them elected by that half,etc. 
 All this is sheer falsehood. 
 The vote I have cited showsthat we did not exclude the non-Iskra -ists even from the Central Committee, let alone the Party, and that we allowed our opponents a very substantial minority . 
 The whole point is that they wanted to have a majority , and when this modest wish was not gratified, they started a row and refused to be represented on the central bodies at all. 
 That such was thecase, Comrade Martov’s assertions at the League notwith-standing, is shown by the following letter which the minor-ity of the Iskra organisation addressed to us, the majority of the Iskra -ists (and the majority at the Congress after the withdrawal of the seven), shortly after the Congress adoptedParagraph 1 of the Rules (it should be noted that the Iskra organisation meeting I have been speaking of was the last: after it, the organisation actually broke up and each side tried to convince the other Congress delegates that it was in the right). 
 Here is the text of the letter: “Having heard the explanation of delegates Sorokin and Sablina101 regarding the wish of the majority of the editorial board and the Emancipation of Labour group to attend the meeting [on such andsuch a date], ** and having with the help of these delegates established *See p. 
 120 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 **According to my reckoning, the date mentioned in the letter was a Tuesday. 
 The meeting took place on Tuesday evening, thatis, after the 28th sitting of the Congress. 
 This chronological point is very important. 
 It is a documentary refutation of Comrade Martov’s opinion that we parted company over the organisation of the central bodies, and not over their personal composition. 
 It is documentary proof of the correctness of my statement of the case at the League Con-gress and in the Letter to the Editors. 
 After the 28th sitting of the Con-that at the previous meeting a list of Central Committee candidates was read which was supposed to have come from us, and which wasused to misrepresent our whole political position; and bearing in mind also that, firstly, this list was attributed to us without any attempt to ascertain its real origin; that, secondly, this circumstance is un-doubtedly connected with the accusation of opportunism openly circu-lated against the majority of the Iskra editorial board and of the Emancipation of Labour group; and that thirdly this accusation is,as is perfectly clear to us, connected with a quite definite plan tochange the composition of the ‘Iskra ’ editorial board —we consider that the explanation given us of the reasons for excluding us from the meeting is unsatisfactory, and that the refusal to admit us to the meet-ing is proof of not wanting to give us the opportunity to refute theabove-mentioned false accusations. 
 “As to the possibility of our reaching agreement on a joint list of candidates for the Central Committee, we declare that the only list we can accept as the basis for agreement is: Popov, Trotsky, and Glebov. 
 Furthermore, we emphasise that this is a compromise list, since the inclusion of Comrade Glebov is to be viewed only as a con-cession to the wishes of the majority-for now that the role he hasplayed at the Congress is clear to us, we do not consider Comrade Glebov a person satisfying the requirements that should be made of a candi-date for the Central Committee. 
 “At the same time, we stress that our entering into negotiations regarding the candidates for the Central Committee has no bearingwhatever on the question of the composition of the editorial board ofthe Central Organ, as on this question (the composition of the editorialboard) we are not prepared to enter into any negotiations. 
 “On behalf of the comrades “Martov and Starover” This letter, which accurately reproduces the frame of mind of the disputing sides and the state of the dispute, takes us at once to the “heart” of the incipient split and re-veals its real causes. 
 The minority of the Iskra organisation, having refused to agree with the majority and preferredfreedom of agitation at the Congress (to which they were,of course, fully entitled), nevertheless tried to induce the “delegates” of the majority to admit them to their private meeting! Naturally, this amusing demand only met with asmile and a shrug at our meeting (where the letter was of gress, Comrades Martov and Starover had a great deal to say about a false accusation of opportunism, but did not say a word about the differences over the composition of the Council or over co-optationto the central bodies (which we argued about at the 25th, 26th, and27th sittings). 
 course read), and the outcry, bordering on hysterics, about “false accusations of opportunism” evoked outright laughter. 
 But let us first examine Martov’s and Starover’s bitter complaints point by point. 
 The list had been wrongly attributed to them; their polit-ical position was being misrepresented. 
—But, as Martovhimself has admitted (League Minutes, p. 
 64), it never oc-curred to me to doubt the truth of his statement that he was not the author of the list. 
 In general, the authorship of the list has nothing to do with the case, and whether the listwas drawn up by some Iskra -ist or by some representative of the “Centre”, etc. 
, is of absolutely no importance. 
 Theimportant thing is that this list, which consisted entirelyof members of the present minority, circulated at the Con-gress, if only as a mere guess or conjecture. 
 Lastly, the most important thing of all is that at the Congress Comrade Mar-tov was obliged to dissociate himself with the utmost vehe-mence from such a list, a list which he now would be bound to greet with delight. 
 Nothing could more saliently exem-plify instability in the evaluation of people and shades than this right-about-face in the course of a couple of months from howling about “defamatory rumours” to forcing on theParty central body the very candidates who figure in thissupposedly defamatory list! * This list, Comrade Martov said at the League Congress, “politically implied a coalition between us and Yuzhny Rabochy , on the one hand, and the Bund, on the other, a coalition in the sense of a direct agreement ” (p. 
 64). 
 That is not true, for, firstly, the Bund would never have enteredinto an “agreement” about a list which did not include asingle Bundist; and, secondly, there was and could have been no question of a direct agreement (which was what Martov thought disgraceful) even with the Yuzhny Rabochy group, let alone the Bund. 
 It was not an agreement but a coalitionthat was in question; not that Comrade Martov had made adeal, but that he was bound to have the support of those very anti-Iskra -ists and unstable elements whom he had fought *These lines were already set up when we received news of the incident of Comrade Gusev and Comrade Deutsch. 
 We shall examinethis incident separately in an appendix . 
 (See pp. 
 416-25 of this vol-ume. 
— Ed. 
) during the first half of the Congress and who had seized upon his error over Paragraph 1 of the Rules. 
 The letter I have quoted proves incontrovertibly that the root of the “griev-ance” lay in the open , and moreover false , accusation of oppor-tunism . 
 This “accusation” which put the fat in the fire, and which Comrade Martov now so carefully steers clear of, in spite of my reminder in the Letter to the Editors , was twofold. 
 Firstly, during the discussion of Paragraph 1 ofthe Rules Plekhanov bluntly declared that Paragraph 1 was a question of “keeping away” from us “every kind ofrepresentative of opportunism”, and that my draft, as a bulwark against their invading the Party, “should, if onlyfor that reason, receive the votes of all enemies of opportun-ism” (Congress Minutes, p. 
 246). 
 These vigorous words, even though I softened them down a little (p. 
 250), * caused a sensation, which was clearly expressed in the speeches of Comrades Rusov (p. 
 247), Trotsky (p. 
 248), and Akimov(p. 
 253). 
 In the “lobby” of our “parliament”, Plekhanov’sthesis was keenly commented on and varied in a thousandways in endless arguments over Paragraph 1. 
 But instead of defending their case on its merits, our dear comrades assumed a ludicrous air of injury and even went to thelength of complaining in writing about a “false accusation ofopportunism”! Their narrow circle mentality and astonishing immaturity as Party members, which cannot stand the fresh breeze of open controversy in the presence of all, is here clearly revealed. 
 It is mentality so familiar to the Russian, asexpressed in the old saying: either coats off, or let’s haveyour hand! These people are so accustomed to the bell-jarseclusion of an intimate and snug little circle that theyalmost fainted as soon as a person spoke up in a free and open arena on his own responsibility. 
 Accusations of opportun-ism!—against whom? Against the Emancipation of Labourgroup, and its majority at that—can you imagine anythingmore terrible? Either split the Party on account of this inef-faceable insult, or hush up this “domestic unpleasantness”by restoring the “continuity” of the bell-jar—this alterna-tive is already pretty clearly indicated in the letter we are *See present edition, Vol. 
 6, pp.

 Intellectualist individualism and the circle mentality had come into conflict with the requirement of open speaking before the Party. 
 Can you imagine such an absurdity, such a squabble, such a complaint about “falseaccusations of opportunism” in the German party? There,proletarian organisation and discipline weaned them fromsuch intellectualist flabbiness long ago. 
 Nobody has anythingbut the profoundest respect for Liebknecht, let us say; but how they would have laughed over there at complaints that he (together with Bebel) was “openly accused of opportunism”at the 1895 Congress, when, on the agrarian question, hefound himself in the bad company of the notorious opportun-ist Vollmar and his friends. 
 Liebknecht’s name is insepara-bly bound up with the history of the German working-class movement not, of course, because he happened to stray into opportunism on such a comparatively minor and specificquestion, but in spite of it. 
 And similarly, in spite of allthe acrimony of the struggle, the name of Comrade Axelrod,say, inspires respect in every Russian Social-Democrat, andalways will; but not because Comrade Axelrod happened to defend an opportunist idea at the Second Congress of our Party, happened to dig out old anarchistic rubbish at theSecond Congress of the League, but in spite of it. 
 Only themost hidebound circle mentality, with its logic of “eithercoats off, or let’s have your hand”, could give rise tohysterics, squabbles, and a Party split because of a “false accusation of opportunism against the majority of the Eman-cipation of Labour group”. 
 The other element of this terrible accusation is intimately connected with the preceding (Comrade Martov tried invain at the League Congress [p. 
 63] to evade and hush upone side of this incident). 
 It relates in fact to that coalition of the anti-Iskra -ist and wavering elements with Comrade Martov which began to emerge in connection with Paragraph 1 of the Rules. 
 Naturally, there was no agreement, direct orindirect, between Comrade Martov and the anti-Iskra -ists, nor could there have been, and nobody suspected himof it: it only seemed so to him in his fright. 
 But politically his error was revealed in the fact that people who undoubt-edly gravitated towards opportunism began to form aroundhim an ever more solid and “compact” majority (which has now become a minority only because of the “accidental” withdrawal of seven delegates). 
 We pointed to this “coali-tion”, also openly , of course, immediately after the matter of Paragraph 1—both at the Congress (see Comrade Pavlo-vich’s remark already quoted: Congress Minutes, p. 
 255)and in the Iskra organisation (Plekhanov, as I recall, point-ed to it in particular). 
 It is literally the same point and thesame jibe as was addressed by Clara Zetkin to Bebel and Liebknecht in 1895, when she said: “ Es tut mir in der Seele weh, dass ich dich in der Gesellschaft seh ’” (“It cuts me to the quick to see you [i. 
e. 
, Bebel] in such company [i. 
e. 
, ofVollmar and Co. 
]”). 
 It is strange, to be sure, that Bebeland Liebknecht did not send a hysterical message to Kautskyand Zetkin complaining of a false accusation of opportun-ism.... 
 As to the list of candidates for the Central Committee, this letter shows that Comrade Martov was mistaken in de-claring at the League that the refusal to come to an agree-ment with us was not yet final—another example of howunwise it is in a political struggle to attempt to reproduce the spoken word from memory, instead of relying on docu-ments. 
 Actually, the “minority” were so modest as to presentthe “majority” with an ultimatum: take two from the“minority” and one (by way of compromise and only as a concession, properly speaking!) from the “majority”. 
 This ismonstrous, but it is a fact. 
 And this fact clearly shows how absurd are the fables now being spread to the effect that the “majority” picked representatives of only one half of theCongress and got them elected by that one half. 
 Just the opposite : the Martovites offered us one out of three only as a concession, consequently, in the event of our not agreeingto this unique “concession”, they wanted to get all the seats filled by their own candidates! At our private meeting we had a good laugh at the Martovites’ modesty and drew upa list of our own: Glebov-Travinsky (subsequently electedto the Central Committee)-Popov . 
 For the latter we then substituted (also at a private meeting of the twenty-four)Comrade Vasilyev (subsequently elected to the Central Committee) only because Comrade Popov refused, first in private conversation and then openly at the Congress(p. 
 338), to be included in our list. 
 That is how matters really stood . 
 The modest “minority” modestly wished to be in the ma-jority. 
 When this modest wish was not met, the “minority” were pleased to decline altogether and to start a row. 
 Yetthere are people who now talk pontifically about the “intran-sigence” of the “majority”! Entering the fray in the arena of free agitation at the Congress, the “minority” presented the “majority” with amusing ultimatums. 
 Having suffered defeat, our heroes burst into tears and began to cry out about a state of siege . 
 Voilà tout . 
 The terrible accusation that we intended to change the composition of the editorial board was also greeted with asmile (at our private meeting of the twenty-four): from the very beginning of the Congress, and even before the Congress, everybody had known perfectly well of the plan to reconsti-tute the editorial board by electing an initial trio (I shall speak of this in greater detail when I come to the election ofthe editorial board at the Congress). 
 That the “minority”took fright at this plan after they saw its correctness splen-didly confirmed by their coalition with the anti-Iskra -ists did not surprise us—it was quite natural. 
 Of course, wecould not take seriously the proposal that we should of ourown free will, without a fight at the Congress, convert our-selves into a minority; nor could we take seriously thiswhole letter, the authors of which had reached such an incredible state of exasperation as to speak of “false accu-sations of opportunism”. 
 We confidently hoped that theirsense of Party duty would very soon get the better of thenatural desire to “vent their spleen”. 
 K. 
 CONTINUATION OF THE DEBATE ON THE RULES COMPOSITION OF THE COUNCIL The succeeding clauses of the Rules aroused far more controversy over details than over principles of organisa-tion. 
 The 24th sitting of the Congress was entirely devotedto the question of representation at Party congresses, and again a decided and definite struggle against the common plans of all the Iskra -ists was waged only by the Bundists (Goldblatt and Lieber, pp. 
 258-59) and Comrade Akimov, who with praiseworthy frankness admitted his role at the Congress: “Every time I speak, I do so fully realising that my arguments will not influence the comrades, but will on the contrary damage the point I am trying to defend”(p. 
 261). 
 Coming just after Paragraph 1 of the Rules, thisapt remark was particularly appropriate; only the words“on the contrary” were not quite in order here, for ComradeAkimov was able not only to damage various points, but at the same time, and by so doing, to “influence the com-rades” ... those very inconsistent Iskra -ists who inclined to-wards opportunist phrase-mongering. 
 Well, in the upshot Paragraph 3 of the Rules, which defines the conditions of representation at congresses, wasadopted by a majority with seven abstentions (p. 
 263)— anti-Iskra -ists, evidently. 
 The arguments over the composition of the Council, which took up the greater part of the 25th Congress sitting, revealedan extraordinary number of groupings around a multitudeof proposals. 
 Abramson and Tsaryov rejected the plan for aCouncil altogether. 
 Panin insisted on making the Council a court of arbitration exclusively, and therefore quite consis-tently moved to delete the definition that the Council isthe supreme institution and that it may be summoned byany two of its members. 
 * Hertz102 and Rusov advocated differing methods of constituting the Council, in additionto the three methods proposed by the five members of the Rules Committee. 
 The questions in dispute reduced themselves primarily to definition of the Council’s functions: whether it was to bea court of arbitration or the supreme institution of theParty. 
 Comrade Panin, as I have said, was consistentlyin favour of the former. 
 But he stood alone. 
 Comrade Mar-tov vigorously opposed this: “I propose that the motion to delete the words, ‘the Council is the supreme institution’, *Apparently, Comrade Starover also inclined to the view of Comrade Panin, only with the difference that the latter knew whathe wanted and quite consistently moved resolutions aimed at con-verting the Council into a pure arbitration or conciliation body, where-as Comrade Starover did not know what he wanted when he said thataccording to the draft the Council could meet “only on the wish ofthe parties” (p. 
 266). 
 That was quite incorrect. 
 /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR be rejected. 
 Our formulation [i. 
e. 
, the formulation of the Council’s functions that we had agreed on in the Rules Committee] deliberately leaves open the possibility of the Council developing into the supreme Party institution. 
 Forus, the Council is not merely a conciliation board. 
” Yet thecomposition of the Council as proposed by Comrade Martovwas solely and exclusively that of a “conciliation board”or court of arbitration: two members from each of the cen-. 
 tral bodies and a fifth to be invited by these four. 
 Not only such a composition of the Council, but even that adopt-ed by the Congress on the motion of Comrades Rusov andHertz (the fifth member to be appointed by the Congress),answers the sole purpose of conciliation or mediation. 
 Be-tween such a composition of the Council and its mission of becoming the supreme Party institution there is an irrecon-cilable contradiction. 
 The composition of the supreme Partyinstitution should be constant, and not dependent on chancechanges (sometimes owing to arrests) in the composition ofthe central bodies. 
 The supreme institution should stand indirect relation to the Party Congress, receiving its powers from the latter, and not from two other Party institutions subordinate to the Congress The supreme institution shouldconsist of persons known to the Party Congress. 
 Lastly, thesupreme institution should not be organised in a way that makes its very existence dependent on chance—the two bodies fail to agree on the selection of the fifth member, and the Party is left without a supreme institution! To this it was objected: 1) that if one of the five were to abstain and theremaining four were to divide equally, the position mightalso prove a hopeless one (Egorov) . 
 This objection is unfounded,for the impossibility of adopting a decision is something that is inevitable at times in the case of any body, but that is quite different from the impossibility of forming the body. 
 Second objection: “if an institution like the Council provesincapable of selecting the fifth member, it will mean thatit is ineffectual in general” (Zasulich). 
 But the point here isnot that it will be ineffectual, but that there will be nosupreme institution at all: without the fifth member, there will be no Council, there will be no “institution ”, and the question of whether it is effectual or not will not even arise. 
Lastly, if the trouble were that it might not be possible to form some Party body over which stood another, higher, body, that would be remediable, for in urgent cases the higher body could fill the gap in one way or another. 
 But there is no body above the Council except the Congress, and therefore to frame the Rules in such a way that it might not even be possible to form the Council would obviously be illogical. 
 Both my brief speeches at the Congress on this question were devoted to an examination (pp. 
 267 and 269) only of these two wrong objections which Martov and other comrades adduced in defence of his proposal. 
 As to the question ofthe Central Organ or; the Central Committee predominatingon the Council, I did not even touch on it . 
 This question was brought up, as early as the 14th sitting of the Congress (p. 
 157), by Comrade Akimov , he being the first to talk of the danger of the Central Organ predominating; and Com-rades Martov, Axelrod, and others, after the Congress , were only following in Akimov ’s footsteps when they invented the absurd and demagogic story that the “majority” wantedto convert the Central Committee into a tool of the editorial board. 
 When he dealt with this question in his State of Siege , Comrade Martov modestly avoided mentioning its real initiator! Anybody who cares to acquaint himself with the entire treatment at the Party Congress of the question of the Cen-tral Organ predominating over the Central Committee, and is not content with isolated quotations torn from their context, will easily perceive how Comrade Martov has dis-torted the matter. 
 It was none other than Comrade Popov who, as early as the 14th sitting, started a polemic against the views of Comrade Akimov , who wanted “the ‘strictest centralisation’ at the top of the Party in order to weaken the influence of the Central Organ ” (p. 
 154; my italics), which in fact is the whole meaning of this [Akimov’s]system”. 
 “Far from defending such centralisation”, ComradePopov added, “I am prepared to combat it with every meansin my power, because it is the banner of opportunism . 
” There you have the root of the famous question of the Central Organ predominating over the Central Committee, and it is not surprising that Comrade Martov is now obliged to pass over the true origin of the question in silence. 
 Even Comrade Popov could not fail to discern the opportunist character of Akimov’s talk about the predominance of the Central Organ, * and in order thoroughly to dissociate himself from ComradeAkimov, Comrade Popov categorically declared: “Let there be three members from the editorial board on this centralbody [the Council] and two from the Central Committee. 
That is a secondary question . 
 [My italics. 
] The important thing is that the leadership, the supreme leadership of the Party, should proceed from one source (p. 
 155). 
 Comrade Akimov objected: “Under the draft, the Central Organ isensured predominance on the Council if only because thecomposition of the editorial board is constant whereas thatof the Central Committee is changeable” (p. 
 157)—an argu-ment which only relates to “constancy” of leadership in matters of principle (which is a normal and desirable thing), and certainly not to “predominance” in the sense of inter-ference or encroachment on independence. 
 And ComradePopov, who at that time did not yet belong to a “minority”which masks its dissatisfaction with the composition of thecentral bodies by spreading tales of the Central Committee’s lack of independence, told Comrade Akimov quite logically: “I propose that it [the Council] be regarded as the directingcentre of the Party, in which case it will be entirely unim-portant whether there are more representatives on the Councilfrom the Central Organ or from the Central Committee ” (pp. 
 157-58; my italics). 
 When the discussion of the composition of the Council was resumed at the 25th sitting, Comrade Pavlovich, con-tinuing the old debate, pronounced in favour of the predom-*Neither Comrade Popov nor Comrade Martov hesitated to call Comrade Akimov an opportunist; they only began to take exception and grow indignant when this appellation was applied to them , and applied justly, is connection with “equality of languages” or Para-graph 1. 
 Comrade Akimov, in whose footsteps Comrade Martov has followed, was however able to conduct himself with greater dignityand manhood at the Party Congress than Comrade Martov and Co. 
 at the League Congress. 
 “I have been called an opportunist here,” said Comrade Akimov at the Party Congress. 
 “I personally consider thisan abusive and offensive term and believe that I have done nothing to deserve it. 
 However, I am not protesting” (p. 
 296). 
 Can it be that Comrades Martov and Starover invited Comrade Akimov to subscribeto their protest against the false accusation of opportunism, but that Comrade Akimov declined? inance of the Central Organ over the Central Committee “in view of the former’s stability” (p. 
 264). 
 It was stability in matters of principle that he had in mind, and that was how he was understood by Comrade Martov, who, speakingimmediately after Comrade Pavlovich, considered it unnec-essary to “fix the preponderance of one institution over theother” and pointed to the possibility of one of the CentralCommittee members residing abroad, “whereby the stability of the Central Committee in matters of principle would to some extent be preserved” (p. 
 264). 
 Here there is not yeteven a trace of the demagogic confusion of stability in mat-ters of principle , and its preservation, with the preservation of the independence and initiative of the Central Commit-tee. 
 At the Congress this confusion, which since the Congress has practically become Comrade Martov’s trump card, was furthered only by Comrade Akimov , who already at that time spoke of the “Arakcheyev 103 spirit of the Rules” (p. 
 268), and said that “ if three members of the Party Council were to be from the Central Organ , the Central Committee would be converted into a mere tool of the editorial board . 
 [My italics. 
] Three persons residing abroad would obtain the unrestricted [!!] right to order the work of the entire [!!] Party. 
 Theirsecurity would be guaranteed, and their power would there-fore be lifelong” (p. 
 268). 
 It was with this absolutely absurdand demagogic talk, in which ideological leadership is called interference in the work of the entire Party (and which after the Congress provided a cheap slogan for Comrade Axelrod with his talk about “theocracy”)—it was with this that Com-rade Pavlovich again took issue when he stressed that he stood “for the stability and purity of the principles repre-sented by Iskra . 
 By giving preponderance to the editorial board of the Central Organ I want to fortify these princi-ples (p. 
 268). 
 That is how the celebrated question of the predominance of the Central Organ over the Central Committee really stands. 
 This famous “difference of principle” on the part of Comrades Axelrod and Martov is nothing but a repetition of the opportunist and demagogic talk of Comrade Akimov , the true character of which was clearly detected even by Comrade Popov, in the days when he had not yet suffered defeat over the composition of the central bodies! * * * To sum up the question of the composition of the Coun-cil: despite Comrade Martov’s attempts in his State of Siege to prove that my statement of the case in the Letter to the Editors is contradictory and incorrect, the minutes of the Congress clearly show that, in comparison with Paragraph 1, this question was indeed only a detail , and that the asser-tion in the article “Our Congress” ( Iskra , No. 
 53) that we argued “almost exclusively” about the organisation of theParty’s central institutions is a complete distortion . 
 It is a distortion all the more outrageous since the author of the article entirely ignores the controversy over Paragraph 1 . 
 Further, that there was no definite grouping of the Iskra -ists over the composition of the Council is also borne outby the minutes: there were no roll-call votes; Martov differedwith Panin; I found common ground with Popov; Egorov and Gusev took up a separate stand, and so on. 
 Finally, my last statement (at the Congress of the League of RussianRevolutionary Social-Democracy Abroad), to the effectthat the Martovites’ coalition with the anti-Iskra -ists grew steadily stronger, is also borne out by Comrade Martov’s and Comrade Axelrod’s swing towards Comrade Akimov— now apparent to everyone—on this question as well. 
 L. 
 CONCLUSION OF THE DEBATE ON THE RULES. 
 CO-OPTATION TO THE CENTRAL BODIES. 
 WITHDRAWAL OF THE RABOCHEYE DYELO DELEGATES Of the subsequent debate on the Rules (26th sitting of the Congress), only the question of restricting the powersof the Central Committee is worth mentioning, for it throwslight on the character of the attacks the Martovites arenow making on hypercentralism. 
 Comrades Egorov and Popov strove for the restriction of centralism with rather more conviction, irrespective of their own candidature orthat of those they supported. 
 When the question was stillin the Rules Commission, they moved that the right of theCentral Committee to dissolve local committees be madecontingent on the consent of the Council and, in addition, be limited to cases specially enumerated (p. 
 272, note 1). 
 This was opposed by three members of the Rules Commis-sion (Glebov, Martov, and myself), and at the Congress Com-rade Martov upheld our view (p. 
 273) and answered Egorov and Popov by saying that “the Central Committee would in any case deliberate before deciding on so serious a step asthe dissolution of an organisation”. 
 As you see, at that time Comrade Martov still turned a deaf ear to every anti-cen-tralist scheme, and the Congress rejected the proposal ofEgorov and Popov—only unfortunately the minutes do not tell us by how many votes. 
 At the Party Congress, Comrade Martov was also “against substituting the word ‘endorses’ for the word ‘organises’[the Central Committee organises committees, etc. 
—Para-graph 6 of the Party Rules]. 
 It must be given the right toorganise as well. 
” That is what Comrade Martov said then not having yet hit on the wonderful idea that the concept “organise ” does not include endorsement, which he discov-ered only at the League Congress. 
 Apart from these two points, the debate over Paragraphs 5-11 of the Rules (Minutes, pp. 
 273-76) is hardly of anyinterest, being confined to quite minor arguments over details. 
 Then came Paragraph 12—the question of co-opta-tion to all Party bodies in general and to the central bodiesin particular. 
 The commission proposed raising the majorityrequired for co-optation from two-thirds to four-fifths. 
Glebov, who presented its report, moved that decisions toco-opt to the Central Committee must be unanimous . 
 Com-rade Egorov, while acknowledging dissonances undesirable, stood for a simple majority in the absence of a reasoned veto. 
Comrade Popov agreed neither with the commission norwith Comrade Egorov and demanded either a simple majori-ty (without the right of veto) or unanimity. 
 Comrade Martovagreed neither with the commission, nor with Glebov, nor with Egorov, nor with Popov, declaring against unanimity, against four-fifths (in favour of two-thirds), and against “mutual co-optation ”, that is , the right of the editorial board of the Central Organ to protest a co-optation to the CentralCommittee and vice versa (“the right of mutual control over co-optation”). 
 As the reader sees, the groupings were highly variegated and the differences so numerous as almost to lend “unique-ness” to the views of each delegate! Comrade Martov said: “I admit the psychological im-possibility of working with unpleasant persons. 
 But it is also important for our organisation to be virile and effec-tual.... 
 The right of the Central Committee and the edito-rial board of the Central Organ to mutual control in cases ofco-optation is unnecessary. 
 It is not because I think that oneis not competent in the sphere of the other that I am againstit. 
 No! The editorial board of the Central Organ, for instance, might give the Central Committee sound advice as to whether Mr. 
 Nadezhdin, say, should be admitted to theCentral Committee. 
 I object because I do not want to createmutually exasperating red tape. 
” I objected: “There are two questions here. 
 The first is that of the required majority, and I am against lowering it from four-fifths to two-thirds. 
 The stipulation for a reasoned protest is not expedient, and I am against it. 
 Incomparablymore important is the second question, the right of theCentral Committee and the Central Organ to mutual controlover co-optation. 
 The mutual consent of the two centralbodies is an essential condition for harmony. 
 What is in-volved here is a possible rupture between the two central bodies. 
 Whoever does not want a split should be concernedto safeguard harmony. 
 We know from the history of theParty that there have been people who caused splits. 
 It is aquestion of principle, a very important question, one onwhich the whole future of the Party may depend” (pp. 
 276-77). 
 That is the full text of the summary of my speech as recorded at the Congress, a speech to which Comrade Mar-tov attaches particularly serious importance. 
 Unfortu-nately, although attaching serious importance to it, he didnot take the trouble to consider it in connection with thewhole debate and the whole political situation at the Con-gress at the moment it was made. 
 The first question that arises is why, in my original draft (see p. 
 394, Paragraph 11), * I stipulated a majority of only two-thirds and did not demand mutual control over co-optation to the central bodies. 
 Comrade Trotsky, who spokeafter me (p. 
 277), did in fact at once raise this question. 
 The answer to it is given in my speech at the League *See present edition, Vol. 
 6, p. 
 475. 
— Ed. 
 Congress and in Comrade Pavlovich’s letter on the Second Congress. 
 Paragraph 1 of the Rules “broke the pot” and it had to be bound tight with a “double knot”—I said at the League Congress. 
 That meant, firstly, that on a purelytheoretical question Martov had proved to be an opportun-ist, and his mistake had been upheld by Lieber and Aki-mov. 
 It meant, secondly, that the coalition of the Marto-vites (that is, an insignificant minority of the Iskra -ists) with the anti-Iskra -ists ensured them a majority at the Congress in the voting on the personal composition of the centralbodies. 
 And it was about the personal composition of the central bodies that I was speaking here, emphasising theneed for harmony and warning against “people who cause splits ”. 
 This warning was indeed of important significance in principle, for the Iskra organisation (which was undoubt-edly best qualified to judge about the personal compositionof the central bodies, having as it did the closest practicalacquaintance with all affairs and with all the candidates)had already made its recommendations on this subject andhad taken the decision we know regarding the candidates who aroused its misgivings. 
 Both morally and on its merits (that is, its competence to judge), the Iskra organisation should have had the decisive say in this delicate matter. 
 Butformally speaking , of course, Comrade Martov had every right to appeal to the Liebers and Akimovs against the majority of the Iskra organisation. 
 And in his brilliant speech on Paragraph 1, Comrade Akimov had said with remarkable explicitness and sagacity that whenever heperceived a difference among the Iskra -ists over the methods of achieving their common Iskra aim, he consciously and deliberately voted for the worse method , because his, Aki-mov’s, aims were diametrically opposed to those of the Iskra -ists. 
 There could not be the slightest doubt therefore that, quite irrespective of the wishes and intentions of ComradeMartov, it was the worse composition of the central bodies that would obtain the support of the Liebers and Akimovs. 
They could vote , they were bound to vote (judging by their deeds , by their vote on Paragraph 1, and not by their words) precisely for that list which would promise the presence of “people who cause splits”, and would do so in order to “cause splits”. 
 Is it surprising, in view of this situation, that I said that it was an important question of principle (harmony between the two central bodies), one on which the whole future of the Party might depend? No Social-Democrat at all acquainted with the Iskra ideas and plans and with the history of the movement, andat all earnest in sharing those ideas, could doubt for a mo-ment that while formally it was quite right and proper forthe dispute within the Iskra organisation over the composi-tion of the central bodies to be decided by the Liebers and Akimovs, this would ensure the worst possible results. 
 It was imperative to fight to avert these worst possible results. 
 How were we to fight them? We did not fight by hysterics and rows, of course, but by methods which were quite loyal and quite legitimate : perceiving that we were in the minority (as on the question of Paragraph 1), we appealed to the Con-gress to protect the rights of the minority . 
 Greater strictness as regards the majority required for adoption of members(four-fifths instead of two-thirds), the requirement of una-nimity for co-optation, mutual control over co-optation to the central bodies—all this we began to advocate when we found ourselves in the minority on the question of the per-sonal composition of the central bodies . 
 This fact is constantly ignored by the Ivans and Peters who are so ready to giveopinions on the Congress lightly, after a couple of chatswith friends, without seriously studying all the minutes and all the “testimony” of the persons concerned. 
 Yet anybody who cares to make a conscientious study of these minutesand this testimony will inevitably encounter the fact I havementioned, namely, that the root of the dispute at that moment of the Congress was the personal composition of the central bodies , and that we strove for stricter conditions of control just because we were in the minority and wanted “a double knot to bind tight the pot” broken by Martovamid the jubilation and with the jubilant assistance of theLiebers and the Akimovs. 
 “If it were not so,” Comrade Pavlovich says, speaking of this moment of the Congress, “one would have to assume that in moving the point about unanimity in cases of co-optation, we were concerned for the interests of our adver-saries; for to the side which predominates in any insti-tution unanimity is unnecessary and even disadvantageous. 
” (Letter on the Second Congress , p. 
 14). 
 But today the chrono-logical aspect of the events is all too often forgotten; it is forgotten that there was a whole period at the Congress when the present minority was the majority (thanks to theparticipation of the Liebers and Akimovs), and that itwas precisely at this period that the controversy over co-optation to the central bodies took place, the underlying reason for which was the difference within the Iskra organi-sation over the personal composition of the central bodies. 
Whoever grasps this fact will understand the passion thatmarked our debates and will not be surprised by the seeming paradox that petty differences over details gave rise toreally important issues of principle. 
 Comrade Deutsch, speaking at this same sitting (p. 
 277), was in many respects right when he said: “This motion isundoubtedly designed for the given moment . 
” Yes, indeed, it is only when we have understood the given moment, in allits complexity, that we can understand the true meaning ofthe controversy. 
 And it is highly important to bear in mind that when we were in the minority, we defended the rights of the minority by such methods as will be acknowledged legitimate and permissible by any European Social-Democrat,namely, by appealing to the Congress for stricter controlover the personal composition of the central bodies. 
 Simi-larly, Comrade Egorov was in many respects right when he said at the Congress, but at a different sitting: “I am exceedingly surprised to hear reference to principles againbeing made in the debate. 
 [This was said in reference to theelections to the Central Committee, at the 31st sitting ofthe Congress, that is, if I am not mistaken, on Thursdaymorning, whereas the 26th sitting, of which we are now speak-ing, was held on Monday evening. 
] I think it is clear to everyone that during the last few days the debate has notrevolved around any question of principle, but exclusivelyaround securing or preventing the inclusion of one or anoth-er person in the central institutions. 
 Let us acknowledgethat principles have been lost at this Congress long since, and call a spade a spade. 
 ( General laughter . 
 Muravyov : ‘I request to have it recorded in the minutes that ComradeMartov smiled’)” (p. 
 337). 
 It is not surprising that Comrade Martov, like the rest of us, laughed at Comrade Egorov’s complaints, which were indeed ludicrous. 
 Yes, “ during the last few days ” a very great deal did revolve around the person-al composition of the central bodies. 
 That is true. 
 Thatwas indeed clear to everyone at the Congress (and it is only now that the minority is trying to obscure this clear fact). 
 And it is true, lastly, that a spade should be called a spade. 
 But,for God’s sake, where is the “loss of principles” here ? After all, we assembled at the Congress in order , in the first days (see p. 
 10, the Congress agenda), to discuss the programme,tactics, and Rules and to decide the questions relating tothem, and in the last days (Items 18 and 19 of the agenda) to discuss the personal composition of the central bodies and todecide those questions. 
 When the last days of congresses are devoted to a struggle over the conductor’s baton, that is natural and absolutely legitimate. 
 (But when a fight overthe conductor’s baton is waged after congresses , that is squab-bling. 
) If someone suffers defeat at the congress over the personal composition of the central bodies (as Comrade Ego-rov did), it is simply ludicrous of him, after that , to speak of “loss of principles”. 
 It is therefore understandable why everybody laughed at Comrade Egorov. 
 And it is alsounderstandable why Comrade Muravyov requested to haveit recorded in the minutes that Comrade Martov shared inthe laughter: in laughing at Comrade Egorov , Comrade Mar-tov was laughing at himself.... 
 In addition to Comrade Muravyov’s irony, it will not be superfluous, perhaps, to mention the following fact. 
 Aswe know, after the Congress Comrade Martov asserted right and left that it was the question of co-optation to the cen-tral bodies that played the cardinal role in our divergence,and that “the majority of the old editorial board” was emphatically opposed to mutual control over co-optation to the central bodies. 
 Before the Congress , when accepting my plan to elect two trios, with mutual co-optation by a two-thirds majority, Comrade Martov wrote to me on the subject : “In adopting this form of mutual co-optation , it should be stressed that after the Congress additions to each body will be effected on somewhat different lines. 
 (I would advise the following : each body co-opts new members, informing the other body of its intention; the latter may enter a pro-test, in which case the dispute shall be settled by the Council . 
 To avoid delays, this procedure should be followed in rela-tion to candidates nominated in advance —at least in the case of the Central Committee —from whose number the additions may then be made more expeditiously. 
) In order to stressthat subsequent co-optation will be effected in the mannerprovided by the Party Rules, the following words shouldbe added to Item 22 *: ‘...by which the decisions taken must be endorsed’. 
” (My italics. 
) Comment is superfluous. 
 Having explained the significance of the moment when the controversy over co-optation to the central bodies took place, we must dwell a little on the votings on the subject— it is unnecessary to dwell on the discussion , as the speeches of Comrade Martov and myself, already quoted, were fol-lowed only by brief interchanges in which very few of thedelegates took part (see Minutes, pp. 
 277-80). 
 In relation to the voting, Comrade Martov asserted at the League Con-gress that in my account of the matter I was guilty of “thegreatest distortion” (League Minutes, p. 
 60) “in represent-ing the struggle around the Rules [Comrade Martov unwit-tingly uttered a profound truth: after Paragraph 1, theheated disputes were indeed around the Rules] as a struggle of Iskra against the Martovites joined in coalition with the Bund. 
” Let us examine this interesting “greatest distortion”. 
 Comrade Martov added together the votings on the composi-tion of the Council and the votings on co-optation and listedeight in all: 1) election to the Council of two members each from the Central Organ and the Central Committee—27 for *The reference is to my original draft of the Tagesordnung (agen-da— Ed. 
) of the Congress and my commentary to it, with which all the delegates were familiar. 
 Item 22 of this draft provided for the election of two trios—to the Central Organ and to the Central Commit-tee—“mutual co-optation” by these six by a two-thirds majority, the endorsement of this mutual co-optation by the Congress, and subse-quent co-optation by the Central Organ and the Central Committee separately. 
 (M), 16 against (L), 7 abstentions. 
 * (Let me say parenthet-ically that the number of abstentions is shown in the Min-utes—p. 
 270—as 8, but that is a detail. 
) 2) election ofthe fifth Council member by the Congress—23 for (L), 18 against (M), 7 abstentions. 
 3) replacement of lapsed Council members by the Council itself—23 against (M), 16 for (L),12 abstentions. 
 4) unanimity for co-optation to the Central Committee—25 for (L), 19 against (M), 7 abstentions. 
 5) the stipulation for one reasoned protest for non-co-optation—21 for (L), 19 against (M), 11 abstentions. 
 6) unanimity for co-optation to the Central Organ—23 for (L), 21 against (M), 7 abstentions. 
 7) votability of a motion giving the Councilthe right to annul a Central Organ or Central Committee decision not to co-opt a new member—25 for (M), 19 against (L), 7 abstentions. 
 8) this motion itself—24 for (M), 23against (L), 4 abstentions. 
 “ Here , evidently ,” Comrade Mar-tov concluded (League Minutes, p. 
 61), “ one Bund delegate voted for the motion while the rest abstained . 
” (My italics. 
) Why, may one ask, did Comrade Martov consider it evident that the Bundist had voted for him , Martov , when there were no roll-call votes? Because he counted the number of votes cast , and when it indicated that the Bund had taken part in the voting, he, Comrade Martov, did not doubt that it had been on his, Martov’s, side. 
 Where, then, is the “greatest distortion” on my part? The total votes were 51, without the Bundists 46, without the Rabocheye Dyelo -ists 43. 
 In seven of the eight votings mentioned by Comrade Martov, 43, 41, 39, 44, 40, 44, and 44 delegates took part; in one, 47 delegates (or rather votes), and here Comrade Martov himself admitted that he was sup-ported by a Bundist. 
 We thus find that the picture sketched by Martov (and sketched incompletely, as we shall soonsee) only confirms and strengthens my account of the struggle ! We find that in a great many cases the number of abstentions was very high : this points to the slight— relatively slight interest shown by the Congress as a whole in certain minor points , and to the absence of any definite grouping of the *The letters M and L in parentheses indicate which side I (L) and which side Martov (M) was on. 
 Iskra -ists on these questions. 
 Martov’s statement that the Bundists “manifestly helped Lenin by abstaining” (League Minutes, p. 
 62) in fact speaks against Martov : it means that it was only when the Bundists were absent or abstained that I could sometimes count upon victory. 
 But whenever the Bundists thought it worth while to intervene in the struggle, they supported Comrade Martov; and the above-mentioned case when 37 delegates voted was not the only time they inter-vened. 
 Whoever cares to refer to the Congress Minutes willnotice a very strange incompleteness in Comrade Martov’s picture. 
 Comrade Martov simply omitted three cases when the Bund did take part in the voting, and it goes without saying that in all these cases Comrade Martov was the victor. 
 Here are the three cases: 1) adoption of Comrade Fomin’s amendment to lower the required majority from four-fifthsto two-thirds—27 for, 21 against (p. 
 278), that is, 48 votes. 
 2) adoption of Comrade Martov’s motion to delete mutual co-optation—26 for, 24 against (p. 
 279), that is, 50 votes. 
Lastly, 3) rejection of my motion to permit co-optation to the Central Organ or the Central Committee only with the consent of all members of the Council (p. 
 280)—27 against,22 for (there was even a roll-call vote, of which, unfortu-nately, there is no record in the minutes), that is, 49 votes. 
 To sum up: on the question of co-optation to the central bodies the Bundists took part in only four votings (the three I have just mentioned, with 48, 50, and 49 votes, and theone mentioned by Comrade Martov, with 47 votes). 
 In all these votings Comrade Martov was the victor. 
 My statement of the case proves to be right in every particular : in declaring that there was a coalition with the Bund, in noting the relatively minor character of the questions (a large number of abstentions in very many cases), and in pointing to theabsence of any definite grouping of the Iskra -ists (no roll-call votes; very few speakers in the debates). 
 Comrade Martov’s attempt to detect a contradiction in my statement of the case turns out to have been made with un-sound means, for he tore isolated words from their context and did not trouble to reconstruct the complete picture. 
 The last paragraph of the Rules, dealing with the organi-sation abroad, again gave rise to debates and votings which were highly significant from the point of view of the group-ings at the Congress. 
 The question at issue was recognitionof the League as the Party organisation abroad. 
 ComradeAkimov, of course, at once rose up in arms, reminding theCongress of the Union Abroad, which had been endorsed bythe First Congress, and pointing out that the question was one of principle. 
 “Let me first make the reservation,” he said, “that I do not attach any particular practical significanceto which way the question is decided. 
 The ideologicalstruggle which has been going on in our Party is undoubted-ly not over yet; but it will be continued on a different planeand with a different alignment of forces.... 
 Paragraph 13 of the Rules once more reflects, and in a very marked way, the tendency to convert our Congress from a Party congress intoa factional congress. 
 Instead of causing all Social-Democratsin Russia to defer to the decisions of the Party Congress inthe name of Party unity, by uniting all Party organisations,it is proposed that the Congress should destroy the organi-sation of the minority and make the minority disappear from the scene” (p. 
 281). 
 As the reader sees, the “continuity”which became so dear to Comrade Martov after his defeatover the composition of the central bodies was no less dearto Comrade Akimov. 
 But at the Congress these people whoapply different standards to themselves and to others rose up in heated protest against Comrade Akimov. 
 Although the programme had been adopted, Iskra endorsed, and nearly the entire Rules passed, that “principle” which “in prin-ciple” distinguished the League from the Union was broughtto the fore. 
 “If Comrade Akimov is anxious to make theissue one of principle,” exclaimed Comrade Martov, “we have nothing against it; especially since Comrade Akimov has spoken of possible combinations in a struggle with two trends. 
The victory of one trend must be sanctioned [this, mark, was said at the 27th sitting of the Congress!] not in the sense that we make another bow to Iskra , but in the sense that we bow a last farewell to all the possible combinations Comrade Akimov spoke of ” (p. 
 282; my italics). 
 What a picture! When all the Congress arguments regard-ing the programme were already over , Comrade Martov con-tinued to bow a last farewell to all possible combinations... until he suffered defeat over the composition of the central bodies! Comrade Martov “bowed a last farewell” at the Con-gress to that possible “combination” which he cheerfully brought to fruition on the very morrow of the Congress . 
 But Comrade Akimov proved even then to be much more far-sighted than Comrade Martov; Comrade Akimov referred tothe five years’ work of “an old Party organisation which, by the will of the First Congress, bears the name of a commit-tee”, and concluded with a most venomous and prescient stab: “As to Comrade Martov’s opinion that my hopes of anew trend appearing in our Party are in vain, let me saythat even he himself inspires me with such hopes ” (p. 
 283; my italics). 
 Yes, it must be confessed, Comrade Martov has fully justified Comrade Akimov’s hopes! Comrade Martov became convinced that Comrade Akimov was right, and joined him, after the “continuity” had beenbroken of an old Party body deemed to have been workingfor three years. 
 Comrade Akimov’s victory did not cost him much effort. 
 But at the Congress Comrade Akimov was backed—and backed consistently—only by Comrades Martynov andBrouckère and the Bundists (eight votes). 
 Comrade Egorov,like the real leader of the “Centre” that he is, adhered tothe golden mean: he agreed with the Iskra -ists, you see, he “sympathised” with them (p. 
 282), and proved his sympa-thy by the proposal (p. 
 283) to avoid the question of prin-ciple altogether and say nothing about either the League or the Union. 
 The proposal was rejected by twenty-seven votesto fifteen. 
 Apparently, in addition to the anti-Iskra -ists (eight), nearly the entire “Centre” (ten) voted with Comrade Egorov (the total vote was forty-two, so that a large number abstained or were absent , as often happened during votes which were uninteresting or whose result was a foregone conclusion ). 
 Whenever the question arose of carrying out the “Iskra ” principles in practice , it turned out that the “sympa-thy” of the “Centre” was purely verbal , and we secured only thirty votes or a little over. 
 This was to be seen even more graphically in the debate and votes on Rusov’s motion (torecognise the League as the sole organisation abroad). 
 Here the anti-Iskra -ists and the “Marsh” took up an outright position of principle , and its champions, Comrades Lieber and Egorov, declared Comrade Rusov’s motion unvotable, impermissible: “It slaughters all the other organisationsabroad” (Egorov). 
 And, not desiring to have any part in“slaughtering organisations”, the speaker not only refusedto vote, but even left the hall. 
 But the leader of the “Centre”must be given his due: he displayed ten times more politi-cal manhood and strength of conviction (in his mistaken principles) than did Comrade Martov and Co. 
, for he stoodup for an organisation being “slaughtered” not only when that organisation was his own circle , defeated in open combat. 
 Comrade Rusov’s motion was deemed votable by twenty-seven votes to fifteen, and was then adopted by twenty-five votes to seventeen. 
 If we add to these seventeen the absent Comrade Egorov, we get the full complement (eighteen ) of the anti-“Iskra ”-ists and the “Centre ”. 
 As a whole Paragraph 13 of the Rules, dealing with the organisation abroad, was adopted by only thirty-one votes to twelve, with six abstentions. 
 This figure, thirty-one— showing the approximate number of Iskra -ists at the Con-gress, that is, of people who consistently advocated Iskra ’s views and applied them in practice —we are now encounter-ing for no less than the sixth time in our analysis of the vot-ing at the Congress (place of the Bund question on the agen-da, the Organising Committee incident, the dissolution of the Yuzhny Rabochy group, and two votes on the agrarian programme). 
 Yet Comrade Martov seriously wants to assureus that there are no grounds for picking out such a “narrow”group of Iskra -ists! Nor can we omit to mention that the adoption of Para-graph 13 of the Rules evoked an extremely characteristic discussion in connection with a statement by Comrades Aki-mov and Martynov that they “refused to take part in thevoting” (p. 
 288). 
 The Bureau of the Congress discussed thisstatement and found—with every reason—that not eventhe direct closing down of the Union would entitle its dele-gates to refuse to take part in the Congress proceedings. 
 Refusal to vote is absolutely abnormal and impermissible— such was the view of the Bureau, which was shared by thewhole Congress, including the Iskra -ists of the minority, who at the 28th sitting hotly condemned what they themselves were guilty of at the 31st ! When Comrade Martynov proceed-ed to defend his statement (p. 
 291), he was opposed alike by Pavlovich, by Trotsky, by Karsky, and by Martov. 
 ComradeMartov was particularly clear on the duties of a dissatis-fied minority (until he found himself in the minority!) andheld forth on the subject in a very didactic manner. 
 “Eitheryou are delegates to the Congress,” he told Comrades Akimov and Martynov, “in which case you must take part in all its proceedings [my italics; Comrade Martov did not yet perceiveany formalism and bureaucracy in subordination of theminority to the majority!]; or you are not delegates, in whichcase you cannot remain at the sitting.... 
 The statement ofthe Union delegates compels me to ask two questions: are they members of the Party, and are they delegates to the Congress?” (P. 
 292). 
 Comrade Martov instructing Comrade Akimov in the duties of a Party member ! But it was not without reason that Com-rade Akimov had said that he had some hopes in ComradeMartov.... 
 These hopes were to come true, however, only after Martov was defeated in the elections. 
 When the matter did not concern himself, but others, Comrade Martov wasdeaf even to the terrible catchword “emergency law”, first launched (if I am not mistaken) by Comrade Martynov . 
 “The explanation given us,” Comrade Martynov repliedto those who urged him to withdraw his statement, “has not made it clear whether the decision was one of principle or an emergency measure against the Union. 
 If the latter, we consider that the Union has been insulted. 
 Comrade Egorovgot the same impression as we did, namely, that it was anemergency law [my italics] against the Union, and there-fore even left the hall” (p. 
 295). 
 Both Comrade Martov and Comrade Trotsky protested vigorously, along with Ple-khanov, against the absurd, truly absurd , idea of regarding a vote of the Congress as an insult ; and Comrade Trotsky, defending a resolution adopted by the Congress on his motion(that Comrades Akimov and Martynov could consider thatfull satisfaction had been given them), declared that “the resolution is one of principle, not a philistine one, and it is no business of ours if anybody takes offence at it ” (p. 
 296). 
 But it very soon became apparent that the circle mentality and the philistine outlook are still all too strong in our Party, and the proud words I have italicised proved to be merely a high-sounding phrase. 
 Comrades Akimov and Martynov refused to withdraw their statement, and walked out of the Congress, amidstthe delegates’ general cry: “Absolutely unwarranted!” M. 
 THE ELECTIONS. 
 END OF THE CONGRESS After adopting the Rules, the Congress passed a resolu-tion on district organisations and a number of resolutionson particular Party organisations, and, following the ex-tremely instructive debate on the Yuzhny Rabochy group which I have analysed above, proceeded to discuss the elec-tion of the Party’s central institutions. 
 We already know that the Iskra organisation, from which the entire Congress had expected an authoritative recommen-dation, had split over this question, for the minority of the organisation wanted to test in free and open combat whetherit could not win a majority at the Congress. 
 We also know that a plan was known long before the Congress—and to all the delegates at the Congress itself—for reconstituting the editorial board by the election of two trios, one to theCentral Organ and one to the Central Committee. 
 Let usdwell on this plan in greater detail in order to throw lighton the Congress debate. 
 Here is the exact text of my commentary to the draft Tagesordnung of the Congress where this plan was set forth: * “The Congress shall elect three persons to the editorial board of the Central Organ and three to the Central Committee. 
These six persons in conjunction shall, if necessary, co-opt by a two-thirds majority vote additional members to the editorial board of the Central Organ and to the Central Committee and report to this effect to the Congress. 
 Afterthe report has been endorsed by the Congress, subsequentco-optation shall be effected by the editorial board of theCentral Organ and by the Central Committee separately. 
” The plan stands out in this text quite definitely and *See my Letter to the Editors of “Iskra ”, p. 
 5, and the League Minutes, p. 
 53. 
 unambiguously: it implies a reconstitution of the editorial board, effected with the participation of the most influential leaders of the practical work. 
 Both the features of this plan which I have emphasised are apparent at once to anyone whotakes the trouble to read the text at all attentively. 
 Butnowadays one has to stop and explain the most elementarythings. 
 It was precisely a reconstitution of the editorial board that the plan implied—not necessarily an enlarge-ment and not necessarily a reduction of its membership, but its reconstitution; for the question of a possible enlargementor reduction was left open : co-optation was provided for only if necessary . 
 Among the suggestions for such reconstitution made by various people, some provided for a possible reduc-tion of the number of editors, and some for increasing it to seven (I personally had always regarded seven as far prefer-able to six), and even to eleven (I considered this possiblein the event of peaceful union with all Social-Democraticorganisations in general and with the Bund and the PolishSocial-Democrats in particular). 
 But what is most impor-tant, and this is usually overlooked by people talking about the “trio”, is that the matter of further co-optation to the Central Organ was to be decided with the participation of themembers of the Central Committee . 
 Not one comrade of all the “minority” members of the organisation or Congressdelegates, who knew of this plan and approved it (eitherexplicitly or tacitly), has taken the trouble to explain the meaning of this point. 
 Firstly, why was a trio, and only a trio, taken as the starting-point for reconstituting the edi-torial board? Obviously, this would have been absolutely senseless if the sole, or at least the main, purpose had been to enlarge the board, and if that board had really been consid-ered a “harmonious” one. 
 If the purpose is to enlarge a “harmonious” body, it would be strange to start , not with the whole body, but with only a part . 
 Obviously, not all me m-bers of the board were considered quite suitable for discuss-ing and deciding the matter of reconstituting it, of convert-ing the old editorial circle into a Party institution . 
 Obviously, even those who personally desired the reconsti-tution to be an enlargement recognised that the old compo-sition of the hoard was not harmonious and did not answerto the ideal of a Party institution, for otherwise there would be no reason first to reduce the six to three in order to enlarge it. 
 I repeat, this is self-evident, and only the temporary confusion of the issue by “personalities” could have caused it to be forgotten. 
 Secondly, it will be seen from the above-quoted text that even the agreement of all three members of the Central Organ would not by itself be enough for the enlargement of thetrio. 
 This, too, is always lost sight of. 
 Two-thirds of six, that is, four votes, were to be required for co-optation; hence it would only be necessary for the three members elected to-the Central Committee to exercise their veto, and no enlarge-ment of the trio would be possible . 
 Conversely, even if two of the three members of the editorial board of the CentralOrgan were opposed to further co-optation, it would never-theless be possible if all three members of the Central Com-mittee were in favour of it. 
 It is thus obvious that the inten-tion was, in converting the old circle into a Party institu-tion, to grant the deciding voice to the Congress-elected leaders of the practical work. 
 Which comrades we roughlyhad in mind may be seen from the fact that prior to the Congress the editorial board unanimously elected Comrade Pavlovich a seventh member of their body, in case it shouldbe necessary to make a statement at the Congress on behalfof the board; in addition to Comrade Pavlovich, a certainold member of the Iskra organisation and member of the Organising Committee, who was subsequently elected to the Central Committee , was proposed for the seventh place. 
 Thus the plan for the election of two trios was obviously designed: 1) to reconstitute the editorial board; 2) to rid itof certain elements of the old circle spirit, which is out ofplace in a Party institution (if there had been nothing to getrid of there would have been no point in the idea of an initial trio!); and, lastly, 3) to get rid of the “theocratic” features of a body of writers (getting rid of them by enlistingthe services of prominent practical workers in deciding the question of enlarging the trio). 
 This plan, with which allthe editors were acquainted, was, clearly, based on three years ’ experience of work and fully accorded with the prin-ciples of revolutionary organisation that we were consistent-ly introducing. 
 In the period of disunity in which Iskra entered the arena, groups were often formed haphazardly and spontaneously, and inevitably suffered from certain per-nicious manifestations of the circle spirit. 
 The creation of a Party presupposed and demanded the elimination of these features; the participation of prominent practical workersin this elimination was essential , for certain members of the editorial board had always dealt with organisational affairs, and the body to enter the system of Party institutions wasto be a body not merely of writers, but of political leaders. 
 It was likewise natural, from the standpoint of the policy Iskra had always pursued, to leave the selection of the ini-tial trio to the Congress we had observed the greatest caution in preparing for the Congress, waiting until all controversialquestions of principle relating to programme, tactics, andorganisation had been fully clarified; we had no doubt that the Congress would be an “ Iskra ”-ist one in the sense that its overwhelming majority would be solid on these funda-mental questions (this was also indicated in part by theresolutions recognising Iskra as the leading organ), we were bound therefore to leave it to the comrades who had borne the whole brunt of the work of disseminating Iskra ’s ideas and preparing for its conversion into a party to decide for themselves who were the most suitable candidates for the new Party institution. 
 It is only by the fact that this plan for “two trios” was a natural one, only by the fact that it fully accorded with Iskra ’s whole policy and with every-thing known about Iskra to people at all closely acquainted with the work, that the general approval of this plan and the absence of any rival plan is to be explained . 
 And so, at the Congress, Comrade Rusov first of all moved the election of two trios. 
 It never even occurred to the follow-ers of Martov, who had informed us in writing that this plan was connected with the false accusation of opportunism , to reduce the dispute over a board of six or three to the ques-tion whether this accusation was right or wrong. 
 Not one of them even hinted at it! None of them ventured to say a singleword about the differing shades of principle involved in the dispute over six or three. 
 They preferred a commoner andcheaper method, namely, to evoke pity , to speak of pos-sible injured feelings , to pretend that the question of the editorial board had already been settled by appointing Iskra the Central Organ. 
 This last argument, adduced by Comrade Koltsov against Comrade Rusov, was a piece of downright falsity . 
 Two separate items were included—not fortuitous-ly, of course—in the Congress agenda (see Minutes, p. 
 10): Item 4—“Central Organ of the Party”, and Item 18—“Election of the Central Committee and the editorial boardof the Central Organ”. 
 That in the first place. 
 In the secondplace, when the Central Organ was being appointed, all the delegates categorically declared that this did not mean the endorsement of the editorial board, but only of the trend, * and not a single protest was raised against these declarations. 
 Thus the statement that by endorsing a definite organ the Congress had in effect endorsed the editorial board—a statement many times reiterated by the adherents of theminority (by Koltsov, p. 
 321, by Posadovsky, p. 
 321, by Popov, p. 
 322, and by many others)—was simply untrue in fact. 
 It was a perfectly obvious manoeuvre to cover a retreat from the position held at the time when the question of thecomposition of the central bodies could still be regardedin a really dispassionate light by all . 
 The retreat could not be justified either by motives of principle (for to raise the question of the “false accusation of opportunism” at the Congress was too much to the disadvantage of the minority, and they did not even hint at it), or by a reference to the factual data showing which was actually more effectual— six or three (for the mere mention of these facts would haveproduced a heap of arguments against the minority). 
 They had to try to burke the issue by talk about a “symmetrical *See Minutes, p. 
 140, Akimov ’s speech: “... I am told that we shall discuss the election of the Central Organ at the end”; Muravyov ’s speech against Akimov, “who takes the question of the future edito-rial board of the Central Organ very much to heart” (p. 
 141), Pavlo-vich ’s speech to the effect that, having appointed the organ, we had obtained “the concrete material on which to perform the operationsComrade Akimov is 90 much concerned about ”, and that there could not be a shadow of doubt about Iskra ’s “submitting” to “the decisions, of the Party” (p. 
 142); Trotsky ’s speech: “Since we are not endorsing the editorial board, what is it that we are endorsing in Iskra ?... Not the name, but the trend... not the name, but the banner” (p. 
 142);Martynov ’s speech: “...Like many other comrades, I consider that while discussing the adoption of Iskra , as a newspaper of a definite trend, as our Central Organ, we should not at this juncture discuss the method of electing or endorsing its editorial board, we shall discuss that later in its proper order on the agenda...” (p. 
 143). 
 whole”, about a “harmonious team”, about a “symmetrical and crystal-integral entity”, and so on. 
 It is not surprising that these arguments were immediately called by their true name: “ wretched words ” (p. 
 328). 
 The very plan for a trio clearly testified to a lack of “harmony”, and the impressionsobtained by the delegates during a month and more of work-ing together obviously afforded a mass of material to enablethem to judge for themselves . 
 When Comrade Posadovsky hinted at this material incautiously and injudiciously from his own standpoint: see pp. 
 321 and 325 regarding the “quali-fied sense” in which he had used the word “dissonances”),Comrade Muravyov bluntly declared: “In my opinion it isnow quite clear to the majority of the Congress that such * dissonances undoubtedly do exist” (p. 
 321). 
 The minority chose to construe the word “dissonances” (which was given currency by Posadovsky, not Muravyov) in a purely per-sonal sense, not daring to take up the gauntlet flung down byComrade Muravyov, not daring to bring forward in defenceof the board of six a single argument on the actual merits of the case . 
 The result was a dispute which for its sterility was more than comic: the majority (through the mouth of Com-rade Muravyov) declared that the true significance of thesix-or-three issue was quite clear to them, but the minoritypersistently refused to listen and affirmed that “we are not in a position to examine it”. 
 The majority not only considered themselves in a position to examine it, but had “examined it” already and announced that the results of the examination were quite clear to them, but the minority apparently feared an examination and took cover behind mere “wretched words”. 
 The majority urged us to “bear in mind that our CentralOrgan is something more than a literary group”; the majority“wanted the Central Organ to be headed by quite definite persons, persons known to the Congress, persons meeting the requirements I have mentioned” (that is, not only literary *What “dissonances” exactly Comrade Posadovsky had in mind the Congress never did learn. 
 Comrade Muravyov, for his part, statedat this same sitting (p. 
 322) that his meaning had been misrepresent-ed, and when the minutes were being endorsed he plainly declared that he “was referring to the dissonances which had been revealed in the Congress debates on various points, dissonances over principle, whoseexistence is now unfortunately a fact that nobody will deny” (p. 
 353). 
 requirements; Comrade Lange’s speech, p. 
 327). 
 Again the minority did not dare to take up the gauntlet and did not say a word as to who, in their opinion, was suitable for what was more than a literary body, as to who was a figureof a “quite definite” magnitude “known to the Congress”. 
The minority continued to take shelter behind their cele-brated “harmony”. 
 Nor was this all. 
 The minority even in-troduced into the debate arguments which were absolutely false in principle and which therefore quite rightly evoked a sharp rebuff. 
 “The Congress,” don’t you see, “has neitherthe moral nor the political right to refashion the editorialboard” (Trotsky, p. 
 326); “it is too delicate [ sic!] a question” (Trotsky again); “ how will the editors who are not reelected feel about the fact that the Congress does not want to see them on the board any more ?” (Tsaryov, p. 
 324. 
) * Such arguments simply put the whole question on the plane of pity and injured feelings , and were a direct admis-sion of bankruptcy as regards real arguments of principle,real political arguments. 
 And the majority immediatelygave this attitude its true name: philistinism (Comrade Rusov). 
 “We are hearing strange speeches from the lips of revolutionaries,” Comrade Rusov justly remarked, “speechesthat are in marked disharmony with the concepts Partywork, Party ethics. 
 The principal argument on which theopponents of electing trios take their stand amounts to apurely philistine view of Party affairs [my italics through-out].... 
 If we adopt this standpoint, which is a philistine and not a Party standpoint, we shall at every election haveto consider: will not Petrov be offended if Ivanov is electedand not he, will not some member of the Organising Com-mittee be offended if another member, and not he, is electedto the Central Committee? Where is this going to land us, comrades? If we have gathered here for the purpose of creat-ing a Party, and not of indulging in mutual compliments and philistine sentimentality , then we can never agree to such a view. 
 We are about to elect officials , and there can be no talk of lack of confidence in any person not elected; our *Cf. 
 Comrade Posadovsky’s speech: “...By electing three of the six members of the old editorial board, you pronounce the other threeto be unnecessary and superfluous. 
 And you have neither any right nor any grounds to do that. 
” only consideration should be the interests of the work and a person ’s suitability for the post to which he is being elected ” (p. 
 325). 
 We would advise all who want to make an independent examination of the reasons for the Party split and to digdown to the roots of it at the Congress to read this speech of Comrade Rusov’s over and over again ; his arguments were not even contested by the minority, let alone refuted. 
 And indeed there is no contesting such elementary, rudimentary truths, which were forgotten only because of “ nervous ex-citement ”, as Comrade Rusov himself rightly explained. 
 And this is really the explanation least discreditable to theminority of how they could desert the Party standpoint fora philistine and circle standpoint. 
 * *In his State of Siege , Comrade Martov treats this question just as he does all the others he touches upon. 
 He does not trouble to givea complete picture of the controversy. 
 He very modestly evades the only real issue of principle that arose in this controversy: philistine sentimentality, or the election of officials; the Party standpoint, orthe injured feelings of the Ivan Ivanoviches? Here, too, Comrade Martov confines himself to plucking out isolated bits and pieces of what happened and adding all sorts of abusive remarks at my expense. 
That’s not quite enough. 
 Comrade Martov! Comrade Martov particularly pesters me with the question why Comrades Axelrod, Zasulich, and Starover were not elected at theCongress. 
 The philistine attitude he has adopted prevents him from seeing how unseemly these questions are (why doesn’t he ask his col-league on the editorial board, Comrade Plekhanov?). 
 He detects a con-tradiction in the fact that I regard the behaviour of the minority at the Congress on the question of the six as “tactless”, yet at the same time demand Party publicity. 
 There is no contradiction here, as Mar-tov himself could easily have seen if he had taken the trouble to give a connected account of the whole matter, and not merely fragments of it. 
 It was tactless to treat the question from a philistine standpointand appeal to pity and consideration for injured feelings; the interests of Party publicity demanded that an estimation be given in point of fact of the advantages of six as compared with three, an estimation of the candidates for the posts, an estimation of the different shades-the minority gave not a hint of any of this at the Congress. 
 By carefully studying the minutes, Comrade Martov would have found in the delegates’ speeches a whole series of arguments against the board of six. 
 Here is a selection from these speeches: firstly, that dissonances, in the sense of different shades of principle, were clearlyapparent in the old six; secondly, that a technical simplification of the editorial work was desirable; thirdly, that the interests of the work came before philistine sentimentality, and only election couldensure that the persons chosen were suited for their posts; fourthly, But the minority were so totally unable to find sensible and business-like arguments against election that, in addi-tion to introducing philistinism into Party affairs, they resorted to downright scandalous practices . 
 Indeed, what other name can we give to the action of Comrade Popov whenhe advised Comrade Muravyov “not to undertake delicatecommissions ” (p. 
 322)? What is this but “getting personal”, as Comrade Sorokin rightly put it (p. 
 328)? What is it but speculating on “ personalities ”, in the absence of political arguments? Was Comrade Sorokin right or wrong when hesaid that “we have always protested against such practices”?“Was it permissible for Comrade Deutsch to try demonstra-tively to pillory comrades who did not agree with him?” * (P. 
 328. 
) Let us sum up the debate on the editorial board. 
 The minority did not refute (nor even try to refute) the major-ity’s numerous statements that the plan for a trio was knownto the delegates at the very beginning of the Congress and that the right of the Congress to choose must not be restricted; fifthly, that the Party now needed something more than a literary group on the Central Organ, that the Central Organ needed not only writers, but administrators as well; sixthly, that the Central Organ must con-sist of quite definite persons, persons known to the Congress ; seventhly, that a board of six was often ineffectual and the board’s work had been accomplished not thanks to its abnormal constitution, but in spite of it ; eighthly, that the conduct of a newspaper was a party (not a circle) affair, etc. 
 Let Comrade Martov, if he is so interested in the reasons for the non-election of these persons, penetrate into the mean-ing of each of these considerations and refute a single one of them. 
 *That is the way Comrade Sorokin, at this same sitting under-stood Comrade Deutsch’s words (cf. 
 p. 
 324—“sharp interchange withOrlov”). 
 Comrade Deutsch explained (p. 
 351) that he had “said nothing like it”, but in the same breath admitted that he had said something very , very much “like it”. 
 “I did not say ‘who dares’,” Comrade Deutsch explained; “what I said was: ‘I would be interested to see the people who would dare [ sic!—Comrade Deutsch fell out of the frying pan into the fire!] to support such a criminal [sic!] proposal as the electionof a board of three’” (p. 
 351). 
 Comrade Deutsch did not refute but confirmed Comrade Sorokin’s words. 
 Comrade Deutsch only confirmed the truth of Comrade Sorokin’s reproach that “all concepts are heremuddled” (in the minority’s arguments in favour of six). 
 Comrade Deutsch only confirmed the pertinence of Comrade Sorokin’s remind-er of the elementary truth that “we are Party members and should be guided exclusively by political considerations”. 
 To cry that elec-tion was criminal was to sink not only to philistinism, but to prac-tices that were downright scandalous ! prior to the Congress , and that, consequently, this plan was based on considerations and facts which had no relation to the events and disputes at the Congress . 
 In defending the board of six, the minority took up a position which was wrong and impermissible in principle , one based on philistine con-siderations. 
 The minority displayed an utter forgetfulnessof the Party attitude towards the election of officials , not even attempting to give an estimation of each candidate for a post and of his suitability or unsuitability for the func-tions it involved. 
 The minority evaded a discussion of the question on its merits and talked instead of their celebratedharmony, “shedding tears” and “indulging in pathos”(Lange’s speech, p. 
 327), as though “somebody was beingmurdered”. 
 In their state of “ nervous excitement ” (p. 
 325) the minority even went to the length of “ getting personal ”, of howling that election was “criminal”, and similar imper-missible practices. 
 The battle over six or three at the 30th sitting of our Congress was a battle between philistinism and the party spirit , between “ personalities ” of the worst kind and political considerations , between wretched words and the most elemen-tary conception of revolutionary duty . 
 And at the 31st sitting, when the Congress, by a majority of nineteen to seventeen with three abstentions, had rejected the motion to endorse the old editorial board as a whole (see p. 
 330 and the errata ), and when the former editors had returned to the hall, Comrade Martov in his “statement on behalf of the majority of the former editorial board” (pp. 
 330-31) displayed this same shakiness and instability of political position and political concepts to an even greater degree. 
 Let us examine in detail each point of this collective statement and my reply (pp. 
 332-33). 
 “From now on,” Comrade Martov said when the old edi-torial board was not endorsed, “the old Iskra does not exist, and it would be more consistent to change its name. 
 At any rate, we see in the new resolution of the Congress a substan-tial limitation of the vote of confidence in Iskra which was passed at one of the first Congress sittings. 
” Comrade Martov and his colleagues raised a truly inter-esting and in many respects instructive question of polit-ical consistency . 
 I have already replied to this by referring to what everyone said when Iskra was being endorsed (Min-utes, p. 
 349, cf. 
 above, p. 
 82). 
 * What we have here is un-questionably a crying instance of political inconsistency, but whether on the part of the majority of the Congress orof the majority of the old editorial board we shall leave thereader to judge. 
 And there are two other questions verypertinently raised by Comrade Martov and his colleagueswhich we shall likewise leave the reader to decide: 1) Did the desire to detect a “limitation of the vote of confidence in Iskra ” in the Congress decision to elect officials to the editorial board of the Central Organ betray a philistine or a Party attitude? 2) When did the old “Iskra ” really cease to exist — starting from No. 
 46, when the two of us, Plekhanov and I,began to conduct it, or from No. 
 53, when the majority of the old editorial board took it over? If the first question is a most interesting question of principle , the second is a most interesting question of fact . 
 “Since it has now been decided,” Comrade Martov contin-ued, “to elect an editorial board of three, I must declareon my own behalf and that of the three other comrades that none of us will sit on this new editorial board. 
 For myself, I must add that if it be true that certain comrades wantedto include my name in the list of candidates for this ‘trio’,I must regard it as an insult which I have done nothing todeserve [ sic!]. 
 I say this in view of the circumstances under which it has been decided to change the editorial board. 
 This decision was taken on the grounds of some kind of‘friction’, ** of the former editorial board having been in-*See pp. 
 308-10 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 **Comrade Martov was probably referring to Comrade Posadovsky’s expression “dissonances”. 
 I repeat that Comrade Posadovsky neverdid explain to the Congress what he meant, while Comrade Muravyov, who had likewise used the expression, explained that he meant disso-nances over principle , as revealed in the Congress debates . 
 The reader will recall that the sole real debate over principles in which four of the editors (Plekhanov, Martov, Axelrod, and I) took part was in connection with Paragraph 1 of the Rules, and that Comrades Martovand Starover complained in writing of a “false accusation of opportun-ism” as being one of the arguments for “changing” the editorial board. 
In this letter , Comrade Martov had detected a clear connection between “opportunism” and the plan to change the editorial board, but at the Con-gress he confined himself to hinting hazily at “ some kind of friction ”. 
 The “false accusation of opportunism” had already been forgotten! effectual; moreover, the Congress decided the matter along definite lines without questioning the editorial board about this friction or even appointing a commission to report whether it had been ineffectual. 
 [Strange that it neveroccurred to any member of the minority to propose to theCongress to “question the editorial board” or appoint a com-mission! Was it not because it would have been useless afterthe split in the Iskra organisation and the failure of the negotiations Comrades Martov and Starover wrote about?] Under the circumstances, I must regard the assumption ofcertain comrades that I would agree to sit on an editorialboard reformed in this manner as a slur on my politicalreputation.... 
” * I have purposely quoted this argument in full to acquaint the reader with a specimen and with the beginning of what has blossomed out so profusely since the Congress and which cannot be called by any other name than squabbling . 
 I have already employed this expression in my Letter to the Edi-tors of “Iskra ”, and in spite of the editors’ annoyance I am obliged to repeat it, for its correctness is beyond dispute. 
 It is a mistake to think that squabbling presupposes “sordid motives” (as the editors of the new Iskra conclude): any revolutionary at all acquainted with our colonies of exilesand political émigrés will have witnessed dozens of cases ofsquabbling in which the most absurd accusations, suspi-*Comrade Martov further added: “Ryazanov might agree to such a role, but not the Martov whom, I think, you know by his work. 
”Inasmuch as this was a personal attack on Ryazanov, Comrade Martov withdrew the remark. 
 But it was not because of Ryazanov’s personalqualities (to refer to them would have been out of place) that his namefigured at the Congress as a byword; it was because of the political complexion of the Borba group—its political mistakes . 
 Comrade Martov does well to withdraw real or assumed personal insults, but this shouldnot lead us to forget political mistakes , which should serve as a lesson to the Party . 
 The Borba group was accused at our Congress of causing “organisational chaos” and “disunity not justified by any considera-tions of principle” (Comrade Martov’s speech, p. 
 38). 
 Such political conduct does indeed deserve censure, and not only when seen in a small group prior to the Party Congress, during the period of general chaos, but also when we see it after the Party Congress, in the period when the chaos has been abolished, even if indulged in by “the majorityof the Iskra editorial board and the majority of the Emancipation of Labour group”. 
 cions, self-accusations, “personalities”, etc. 
, were levelled and harped upon owing to “nervous excitement” and abnor-mal, stagnant conditions of life. 
 No sensible person will necessarily seek for sordid motives in these squabbles, how-ever sordid their manifestations may be . 
 And it is only to “nervous excitement” that we can attribute that tangledskein of absurdities, personalities, fantastic horrors, andimaginary insults and slurs which is contained in the above-quoted passage from Comrade Martov’s speech. 
 Stagnant conditions of life breed such squabbles among us by thehundred, and a political party would be unworthy of respectif it did not have the courage to designate its malady by itstrue name, to make a ruthless diagnosis and search fora cure. 
 Insofar as anything relating to principles can be extracted at all from this tangled skein, one is led inevitably to the conclusion that “elections have nothing to do with anyslurs on political reputations”, that “to deny the right ofthe Congress to hold new elections, make new appointmentsof any kind, and change the composition of its authorised boards” is to confuse the issue, and that “Comrade Martov’s views on the permissibility of electing part of the old board reflect an extreme confusion of political ideas ” (as I expressed it at the Congress, p. 
 332). 
 * I shall omit Comrade Martov’s “personal” remark as to who initiated the plan for the trio, and shall pass to his “political” characterisation of the significance attaching to the non-endorsement of the old editorial board: “...Whathas now taken place is the last act of the struggle which hasraged during the second half of the Congress. 
 [Quite right!And this second half of the Congress began when Martov fellinto the tight clutches of Comrade Akimov over Paragraph 1 of the Rules. 
] It is an open secret that in this reform it is not a question of being ‘effectual’, but of a struggle for in-fluence on the Central Committee. 
 [Firstly, it is an opensecret that it was a question of being effectual, as well as of a divergence over the composition of the Central Committee, for the plan of the “reform” was proposed at a time when that divergence was nowhere in sight and when Comrade Martov *See present edition, Vol. 
 6, pp. 
 503-04. 
— Ed. 
 joined us in electing Comrade Pavlovich a seventh member of the editorial board! Secondly, we have already shown by documentary proofs that it was a question of the personal composition of the Central Committee, that à la fin des fins the matter came down to a difference of lists: Glebov-Tra-vinsky-Popov or Glebov-Trotsky-Popov. 
] The majority ofthe editorial board showed that they did not want the Cen-tral Committee to be converted into a tool of the editorial board. 
 [That is Akimov’s refrain: the question of the influence for which every majority fights at any and every partycongress so as then to consolidate it with the help of a major-ity on the central institutions is transferred to the plane of opportunist slanders about a “tool” of the editorial board , about a “mere appendage ” of the editorial board, as Comrade Martov himself put it somewhat later, p. 
 334. 
] That is why it was found necessary to reduce the number of members ofthe editorial board [!!]. 
 And that is why I cannot join suchan editorial board. 
 [Just examine this “that is why” alittle more carefully. 
 How might the editorial board have converted the Central Committee into an appendage or tool? Only if it had had three votes on the Council and had abused its superiority. 
 Is that not clear? And is it not likewiseclear that, having been elected the third member, ComradeMartov could always have prevented such an abuse and by his vote alone have destroyed all superiority of the editorial board on the Council? Consequently, the whole matter boils down to the personal composition of the Central Committee, and it is at once clear that the talk about a tool and anappendage is slander . 
] Together with the majority of the old editorial board, I thought that the Congress would put anend to the ‘state of siege’ in the Party and would establish anormal state of affairs. 
 But as a matter of fact the state of siege, with its emergency laws against particular groups, still continues, and has even become more acute. 
 Only ifthe old editorial board remains in its entirety can we guar-antee that the rights conferred on the editorial board bythe Rules will not be used to the detriment of theParty.... 
” There you have the whole passage from Comrade Mar-tov’s speech in which he first advanced the notorious war-cry of a “state of siege ”. 
 And now look at my reply to him: “...However, in correcting Martov’s statement about the private character of the plan for two trios, I have no inten-tion of denying Martov’s assertion of the ‘political sig-nificance’ of the step we took in not endorsing the old edi-torial board. 
 On the contrary, I fully and unreservedly agreewith Comrade Martov that this step is of great politicalsignificance—only not the significance which Martov ascribesto it. 
 He said that it was an act in a struggle for influence on the Central Committee in Russia. 
 I go farther than Martov. 
 The whole activity of Iskra as a separate group has hitherto been a struggle for influence; but now it is a matterof something more, namely, the organisational consolidationof this influence, and not only a struggle for it. 
 How pro-foundly Comrade Martov and I differ politically on this point is shown by the fact that he blames me for this wish to influence the Central Committee, whereas I count it to mycredit that I strove and still strive to consolidate this influ-ence by organisational means. 
 It appears that we are eventalking in different languages! What would be the pointof all our work, of all our efforts, if they ended in the same old struggle for influence, and not in its complete acquisi-tion and consolidation? Yes, Comrade Martov is absolutelyright: the step we have taken is undoubtedly a major politi-cal step showing that one of the trends now to be observedhas been chosen for the future work of our Party. 
 And I am not at all frightened by the dreadful words ‘a state of siege in the Party ’, ‘emergency laws against particular individuals and groups ’, etc. 
 We not only can but we must create a ‘state of siege’ in relation to unstable and vacillating elements,and all our Party Rules, the whole system of centralism nowendorsed by the Congress are nothing but a ‘state of siege’in respect to the numerous sources of political vagueness. 
 It is special laws, even if they are emergency laws, that are needed as measures against vagueness, and the step takenby the Congress has correctly indicated the political direc-tion to be followed, by having created a firm basis forsuch laws and such measures. 
 ” * I have italicised in this summary of my speech at the Congress the sentence which Comrade Martov preferred to *See present edition, Vol. 
 6, pp. 
 507-08. 
— Ed. 
 omit in his “State of Siege” (p. 
 16). 
 It is not surprising that he did not like this sentence and did not choose to understand its obvious meaning. 
 What does the expression “dreadful words” imply, Com-rade Martov? It implies mockery , mockery of those who give big names to little things, who confuse a simple question by pretentiousphrase-mongering. 
 The little and simple fact which alone could have given, and actually did give, Comrade Martov cause for “nervousexcitement” was nothing but his defeat at the Congress over the personal composition of the central bodies . 
 The political significance of this simple fact was that, having won, themajority of the Party Congress consolidated their influence by establishing their majority in the Party leadership as well, by creating an organisational basis for a struggle, withthe help of the Rules, against what this majority consideredto be vacillation, instability, and vagueness. 
 * To make this an occasion for talking of a “struggle for influence” withhorror in one’s eyes and complaining of a “state of siege” was nothing but pretentious phrase-mongering , dreadful words. 
 Comrade Martov does not agree with this? Then perhaps he will try to prove to us that a party congress has everexisted, or is in general conceivable, where the majoritywould not proceed to consolidate the influence they hadgained: 1) by securing a majority on the central bodies, and 2) by endowing it with powers to counteract vacillation, instability, and vagueness. 
 Before the elections, our Congress had to decide whether to give one-third of the votes on the Central Organ and on the Central Committee to the Party majority or the Partyminority. 
 The board of six and Comrade Martov’s list meant giving one-third to us and two-thirds to his followers. 
 *How was the instability, vacillation, and vagueness of the Iskra -ist minority manifested at the Congress? Firstly, by their oppor-tunist phrase-mongering over Paragraph 1 of the Rules, secondly, bytheir coalition with Comrades Akimov and Lieber, which during thesecond half of the Congress rapidly grew more pronounced; thirdly,by their readiness to degrade the question of electing officials to theCentral Organ to the level of philistinism, of wretched words, and even of getting personal. 
 After the Congress all these lovely attributes developed from mere buds into blossoms and fruit. 
 A trio on the Central Organ and our list meant two-thirds for us and one-third for Comrade Martov’s followers. 
 Comrade Martov refused to make terms with us or yield, and challenged us in writing to a battle at the Congress. 
 Having suffered defeat at the Congress, he began to weep and to complain ofa “state of siege”! Well, isn’t that squabbling? Isn’t it anew manifestation of the wishy-washiness of the intellectual? One cannot help recalling in this connection the brilliant social and psychological characterisation of this latter quality recently given by Karl Kautsky. 
 The Social-Demo-cratic parties of different countries suffer not infrequentlynowadays from similar maladies, and it would be very, veryuseful for us to learn from more experienced comrades thecorrect diagnosis and the correct cure. 
 Karl Kautsky’s char-acterisation of certain intellectuals will therefore be only a seeming digression from our theme. 
 “The problem ... that again interests us so keenly today is the antagonism between the intelligentsia * and the proletariat . 
 My colleagues [Kautsky is himself an intellectual, a writer and editor] will mostlybe indignant that I admit this antagonism. 
 But it actually exists, and, as in other cases, it would be the most inexpedient tactics to try to overcome the fact by denying it. 
 This antagonism is a social one, itrelates to classes, not to individuals. 
 The individual intellectual, like the individual capitalist, may identify himself with the proletariat in its class struggle. 
 When he does, he changes his character too. 
 Itis not this type of intellectual, who is still an exception among his class, that we shall mainly speak of in what follows. 
 Unless otherwise stated, I shall use the word intellectual to mean only the common run of intellectual who takes the stand of bourgeois society , and who is char-acteristic of the intelligentsia as a class . 
 This class stands in a certain antagonism to the proletariat. 
 “This antagonism differs, however, from the antagonism between labour and capital. 
 The intellectual is not a capitalist. 
 True, his standard of life is bourgeois, and he must maintain it if he is not tobecome a pauper; but at the same time he is compelled to sell the product of his labour, and often his labour-power, and is himself often enough exploited and humiliated by the capitalist. 
 Hencethe intellectual does not stand in any economic antagonism to the proletariat. 
 But his status of life and his conditions of labour are not proletarian, and this gives rise to a certain antagonism in sentimentsand ideas. 
 *I use the words intellectual and intelligentsia to translate the German Literat and Literatentum , which include not only writers but in general all educated people, the members of the liberal professions, the brain workers, as the English call them, as distinct from manual workers. 
 “As an isolated individual, the proletarian is nothing. 
 His whole strength, his whole progress, all his hopes and expectations are derivedfrom organisation , from systematic action in conjunction with his fellows. 
 He feels big and strong when he forms part of a big and strong organism. 
 This organism is the main thing for him; the individual in comparison means very little. 
 The proletarian fights with the ut-most devotion as part of the anonymous mass, without prospect ofpersonal advantage or personal glory, doing his duty in any post heis assigned to with a voluntary discipline which pervades all his feel-ings and thoughts. 
 “Quite different is the case of the intellectual. 
 He does not fight by means of power, but by argument. 
 His weapons are his personalknowledge, his personal ability, his personal convictions. 
 He canattain to any position at all only through his personal qualities. 
Hence the freest play for his individuality seems to him the primecondition for successful activity. 
 It is only with difficulty that he submits to being a part subordinate to a whole, and then only from necessity, not from inclination. 
 He recognises the need of disciplineonly for the mass, not for the elect minds. 
 And of course he counts him-self among the latter.... 
 “Nietzsche’s philosophy, with its cult of the superman, for whom the fulfilment of his own individuality is everything and any subordi-nation of that individuality to a great social aim is vulgar and de-spicable, is the real philosophy of the intellectual; and it renders him totally unfit to take part in the class struggle of the proletariat. 
 “Next to Nietzsche, the most outstanding exponent of a philosophy answering to the sentiments of the intelligentsia is probably Ibsen. 
 His Doctor Stockmann (in An Enemy of the People ) is not a socialist, as many have thought, but the type of the intellectual, who is boundto come into conflict with the proletarian movement, and with any movement of the people generally, as soon as he attempts to work within it. 
 For the basis of the proletarian movement, as of every demo-cratic * movement, is respect for the majority of one’s fellows. 
 The typical intellectual à la Stockmann regards a ‘compact majority’ as a monster that must be overthrown.... 
 “An ideal example of an intellectual who had become thoroughly imbued with the sentiments of the proletariat, and who, although he was a brilliant writer, had quite lost the specific mentality of theintellectual, marched cheerfully with the rank and file, worked in any post he was assigned to, subordinated himself whole-heartedly to our great cause, and despised the feeble whining [ weichliches Gewin-sel] about the suppression of his individuality which the intellectual trained on Ibsen and Nietzsche is prone to indulge in when he happens to be in the minority—an ideal example of the kind of intellectual *It is extremely characteristic of the confusion brought by our Martovites into all questions of organisation that, though they have swung towards Akimov and a misplaced democracy, they are at the same time incensed at the democratic election of the editorial board , its election at the Congress , as planned in advance by everybody! Perhaps that is your principle , gentlemen? the socialist movement needs was Liebknecht. 
 We may also mention Marx, who never forced himself to the forefront and whose partydiscipline in the International, where he often found himself in theminority, was exemplary. 
” * Just such feeble whining of intellectuals who happened to find themselves in the minority, and nothing more, wasthe refusal of Martov and his friends to be named for officemerely because the old circle had not been endorsed, as were their complaints of a state of siege and emergency laws “against particular groups”, which Martov cared nothingabout when Yuzhny Rabochy and Rabocheye Dyelo were dis-solved, but only came to care about when his group was dis-solved. 
 Just such feeble whining of intellectuals who happened to find themselves in the minority was that endless torrent of complaints, reproaches, hints, accusations, slanders, andinsinuations regarding the “compact majority” which wasstarted by Martov and which poured out in such a flood atour Party Congress ** (and even more so after). 
 The minority bitterly complained that the compact majority held private meetings. 
 Well, the minority had to do something to conceal the unpleasant fact that the dele-gates it invited to its own private meetings refused to attend,while those who would willingly have attended (the Egorovs,Makhovs, and Brouckères) the minority could not inviteafter all the fighting it had done with them at the Congress. 
 The minority bitterly complained of the “false accusation of opportunism”. 
 Well, it had to do something to concealthe unpleasant fact that it was opportunists , who in most cases had followed the anti-Iskra -ists—and partly these anti-Iskra -ists themselves—that made up the compact minority, seizing with both hands on the championship of the circle spirit in Party institutions, opportunism in arguments, philistinism in Party affairs, and the instabilityand wishy-washiness of the intellectual. 
 We shall show in the next section what is the explana-tion of the highly interesting political fact that a “compact *Karl Kautsky, “Franz Mehring”, Neue Zeit , XXII, I, S.

, of the Congress Minutes. 
 majority” was formed towards the end of the Congress, and why, in spite of every challenge, the minority so very, very warily evades the reasons for its formation and its histor y. 
 But let us first finish our analysis of the Congress debates. 
 During the elections to the Central Committee, Comrade Martov moved a highly characteristic resolution (p. 
 336),the three main features of which I have on occasion referredto as “mate in three moves”. 
 Here they are: 1) to ballot lists of candidates for the Central Committee, and not the candidates individually; 2) after the lists had been an-nounced, to allow two sittings to elapse (for discussion, evi-dently); 3) in the absence of an absolute majority, a secondballot to be regarded as final. 
 This resolution was a most care-fully conceived stratagem (we must give the adversary his due!), with which Comrade Egorov did not agree (p. 
 337), but which would most certainly have assured a complete victory for Martov if the seven Bundists and “Rabocheye Dyelo ”-ists had not quit the Congress . 
 The reason for this stratagem was that the Iskra -ist minority did not have , and could not have had , a “direct agreement” (such as there was among the Iskra -ist majority) even with the Egorovs and Makhovs , let alone the Bund and Brouckère. 
 Remember that at the League Congress Comrade Martov complained that the “false accusation of opportunism” pre-sumed a direct agreement between him and the Bund. 
 Irepeat, this only seemed so to Comrade Martov in his fright, and this very refusal of Comrade Egorov to agree to the ballot-ing of lists (Comrade Egorov “had not yet lost his princi-ples”—presumably the principles that made him join forceswith Goldblatt in appraising the absolute importance ofdemocratic guarantees) graphically demonstrates the highly important fact that there could be no question of a “direct agreement ” even with Egorov . 
 But a coalition there could be, and was, both with Egorov and with Brouckère, a coalitionin the sense that the Martovites were sure of their support every time they, the Martovites, came into serious conflictwith us and Akimov and his friends had to choose the lesser evil. 
 There was not and is not the slightest doubt that Com-rades Akimov and Lieber would certainly have voted both forthe board of six on the Central Organ and for Martov ’s list for the Central Committee , as being the lesser evil , as being what would least achieve the “Iskra ” aims (see Akimov’s speech on Paragraph 1 and the “hopes” he placed in Martov). 
 Balloting of lists, allowing two sittings to elapse, and a re-ballot were designed to achieve this very result with almost mechanicalcertainty without a direct agreement. 
 But since our compact majority remained a compact majority, Comrade Martov’s flank movement would onlyhave meant delay, and we were bound to reject it. 
 The minor-ity poured forth their complaints on this score in a written statement (p. 
 341) and, following the example of Martynov and Akimov , refused to vote in the elections to the Central Committee, “in view of the conditions in which they wereheld”. 
 Since the Congress, such complaints of abnormalconditions at the elections (see State of Siege , p. 
 31) have been poured right and left into the ears of hundreds of Party gossips. 
 But in what did this abnormality consist? In the secret ballot—which had been stipulated beforehand inthe Standing Orders of the Congress (Point 6, Minutes, p. 
 11),and in which it was absurd to detect any “hypocrisy” or“injustice”? In the formation of a compact majority—that “monster” in the eyes of wishy-washy intellectuals? Or in the abnormal desire of these worthy intellectuals to violate the pledge they had given before the Congress that they would recognise all its elections (p. 
 380, Point 18 of the CongressRegulations)? Comrade Popov subtly hinted at this desire when he asked outright at the Congress on the day of the elections: “Is the Bureau certain that the decision of the Congress isvalid and in order when half the delegates refused to vote?” * The Bureau of course replied that it was certain, and recalledthe incident of Comrades Akimov and Martynov. 
 ComradeMartov agreed with the Bureau and explicitly declared that Comrade Popov was mistaken and that “ the decisions of the Congress are valid ” (p. 
 343). 
 Now let the reader form his own opinion of the political consistency—highly nor-mal, we must suppose—revealed by a comparison of this declaration made by him in the hearing of the Party with his *P. 
 342. 
 This refers to the election of the fifth member of the Council. 
 Twenty-four ballots (out of a total of forty-four votes) werecast, two of which were blank. 
 /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR behaviour after the Congress and with the phrase in his State of Siege about “ the revolt of half the Party which already began at the Congress ” ( p. 
 20). 
 The hopes which Comrade Akimov had placed in Comrade Martov outweighed theephemeral good intentions of Martov himself. 
 “You have conquered ”, Comrade Akimov! * * * Certain features, seemingly petty but actually very impor-tant, of the end of the Congress, the part of it after the elec-tions, may serve to show how pure and simple a “dreadfulword” was the famous phrase about a “state of siege”, whichhas now for ever acquired a tragicomical meaning. 
 ComradeMartov is now making great play with this tragicomical “state of siege”, seriously assuring both himself and his readers that this bogey of his own invention implied somesort of abnormal persecution, hounding, bullying of the“minority” by the “majority”. 
 We shall presently show howmatters stood after the Congress. 
 But take even the end of the Congress, and you will find that after the elections , far from persecuting the unhappy Martovites, who are supposed to have been bullied, ill-treated, and led to theslaughter, the “compact majority” itself offered them (through Lyadov) two seats out of three on the Minutes Committee (p. 
 354). 
 Take the resolutions on tactical andother questions (p. 
 355 et seq. 
), and you will find that they were discussed on their merits in a purely business-like way, and that the signatories to many of the resolutionsincluded both representatives of the monstrous compact“majority” and followers of the “humiliated and insulted”“minority” (Minutes, pp. 
 355, 357, 363, 365 and 367). 
 Thislooks like “shutting out from work” and “bullying” in gen-eral, does it not? The only interesting—but, unfortunately, all too brief— controversy on the substance of a question arose in connectionwith Starover’s resolution on the liberals. 
 As one can seefrom the signatures to it (pp. 
 357 and 358), it was adoptedby the Congress because three of the supporters of the “ma-jority” (Braun, Orlov, and Osipov 104) voted both for it and for Plekhanov’s resolution, not perceiving the irreconcilablecontradiction between the two. 
 No irreconcilable contra-diction is apparent at first glance, because Plekhanov’s resolution lays down a general principle, outlines a definite attitude, as regards principles and tactics, towards bourgeois liberalism in Russia , whereas Starover’s attempts to define the concrete conditions in which “temporary agreements ” would be permissible with “liberal or liberal-democratic trends”. 
 The subjects of the two resolutions are different. 
But Starover’s suffers from political vagueness , and is con-sequently petty and shallow. 
 It does not define the class content of Russian liberalism , does not indicate the definite political trends in which this is expressed, does not explainto the proletariat the principal tasks of propaganda and agitation in relation to these definite trends; it confuses(owing to its vagueness) such different things as the student movement and Osvobozhdeniye , it too pettily and casu-istically prescribes three concrete conditions under which “temporary agreements” would be permissible. 
 Here too,as in many other cases, political vagueness leads to casu-istry. 
 The absence of any general principle and the attemptto enumerate “conditions” result in a petty and, strictly speaking, incorrect specification of these conditions. 
 Just examine Starover’s three conditions: 1) the “liberal orliberal-democratic trends” shall “clearly and unambig-uously declare that in their struggle against the autocraticgovernment they will resolutely side with the RussianSocial-Democrats”. 
 What is the difference between the liberal and liberal-democratic trends? The resolution furnishes no material for a reply to this question. 
 Is it not that theliberal trends speak for the politically least progressivesections of the bourgeoisie, and the liberal-democratic—for the more progressive sections of the bourgeoisie and thepetty bourgeoisie? If that is so, can Comrade Starover pos-sibly think that the sections of the bourgeoisie which are least progressive (but progressive nevertheless, for otherwisethere could be no talk of liberalism) can “resolutely sidewith the Social-Democrats”?? That is absurd, and evenif the spokesmen of such a trend were to “ declare it clearly and unambiguously ” (an absolutely impossible assumption), we, the party of the proletariat, would be obliged not to believe their declarations. 
 To be a liberal and resolutely side with the Social-Democrats—the one excludes the other. 
 Further, let us assume a case where “liberal or liberal-democratic trends” clearly and unambiguously declare that in their struggle against the autocracy they will resolutely side with the Socialist-Revolutionaries . 
 Such an assumption is far less unlikely than Comrade Starover’s (owing to thebourgeois-democratic nature of the Socialist-Revolutionarytrend). 
 From his resolution, because of its vagueness andcasuistry, it would appear that in a case like this temporary agreements with such liberals would be impermissible . 
 But this conclusion, which follows inevitably from ComradeStarover’s resolution, is an absolutely false one. 
 Temporary agreements are permissible with the Socialist-Revolution-aries (see the Congress resolution on the latter), and, conse-quently , with liberals who side with the Socialist-Revolu-tionaries. 
 Second condition: these trends “shall not include in their programmes any demands running counter to the interestsof the working class or the democracy generally, or obscuringtheir political consciousness”. 
 Here we have the same mis-take again: there never have been, nor can there be, liberal-democratic trends which did not include in their programmes demands running counter to the interests of the workingclass and obscuring its (the proletariat’s) political conscious-ness. 
 Even one of the most democratic sections of our liber-al-democratic trend, the Socialist-Revolutionaries, put for-ward in their programme—a muddled one, like all liberal programmes—demands that run counter to the interests of the working class and obscure its political consciousness. 
The conclusion to be drawn from this fact is that it is essen-tial to “expose the limitations and inadequacy of the bour-geois emancipation movement”, but not that temporaryagreements are impermissible. 
 Lastly, in the general form in which it is presented, Com-rade Starover’s third “condition” (that the liberal-democratsshould make universal, equal, secret, and direct suffragethe slogan of their struggle) is likewise incorrect : it would be unwise to declare impermissible in all cases temporary and partial agreements with liberal-democratic trends whose slogan was a constitution with a qualified suffrage, or a “curtailed” constitution generally. 
 As a matter of fact,the Osvobozhdeniye “trend” would fit into just this category, but it would be political short-sightedness incompatible with the principles of Marxism to tie one’s hands by forbid-ding in advance “temporary agreements” with even the most timorous liberals. 
 To sum up: Comrade Starover’s resolution, which was signed also by Comrades Martov and Axelrod, is a mistake , and the Third Congress would be wise to rescind it. 
 It suffersfrom political vagueness in its theoretical and tactical posi-tion, from casuistry in the practical “conditions” it stip-ulates. 
 It confuses two questions : 1) the exposure of the “anti-revolutionary and anti-proletarian” features of all liberal-democratic trends, and the need to combat these features, and 2) the conditions for temporary and partial agreements with any of these trends. 
 It does not give what it should (an analysis of the class content of liberalism), and gives what it should not (prescription of “conditions”). 
 It isabsurd in general to draw up detailed “conditions” fortemporary agreements at a party congress, when there isnot even a definite partner to such possible agreementsin view; and even if there were such a definite partner in view, it would be a hundred times more rational to leave the defini-tion of the “conditions” for a temporary agreement to theParty’s central institutions, as the Congress did in relationto the Socialist-Revolutionary “trend” (see Plekhanov’s modification of the end of Comrade Axelrod’s resolution—Minutes, pp. 
 362 and 15). 
 As to the objections of the “minority” to Plekhanov’s res-olution, Comrade Martov’s only argument was: Plekhanov’s resolution “ends with the paltry conclusion that a particular writer should be exposed. 
 Would this not be ‘using a sledge-hammer to kill a fly’?” (P. 
 358). 
 This argument, whose emptiness is concealed by a smart phrase—“paltry conclu-sion”—provides a new specimen of pompous phrase-monger-ing. 
 Firstly, Plekhanov’s resolution speaks of “exposing in the eyes of the proletariat the limitations and inadequacy of the bourgeois emancipation movement wherever these limitations and inadequacy manifest themselves”. 
 Hence Comrade Martov’s assertion (at the League Congress: Min-utes, p. 
 88) that “all attention is to be directed only to Struve, only to one liberal” is the sheerest nonsense. 
 Secondly, to compare Mr. 
 Struve to a “fly” when the possibility of tem-porary agreements with the Russian liberals is in ques-tion, is to sacrifice an elementary and manifest political fact for a smart phrase. 
 No, Mr. 
 Struve is not a fly, but a political magnitude, and not because he personally is sucha big figure, but because of his position as the sole represen-tative of Russian liberalism—of at all effectual and orga-nised liberalism—in the illegal world. 
 Therefore, to talkof the Russian liberals, and of what our Party’s attitude towards them should be, without having precisely Mr. 
 Struve and Osvobozhdeniye in mind is to talk without saying any-thing. 
 Or perhaps Comrade Martov will show us even one single “liberal or liberal-democratic trend” in Russia which could compare even remotely today with the Osvobozhdeniye trend? It would be interesting to see him try! * “Struve’s name means nothing to the workers,” said Com-rade Kostrov, supporting Comrade Martov. 
 I hope ComradeKostrov and Comrade Martov will not be offended—but thatargument is fully in the Akimov style. 
 It is like the argu-ment about the proletariat in the genitive case. 
 105 Who are the workers to whom Struve’s name (and the name of Osvobozhdeniye , mentioned in Comrade Plekhanov’s resolution alongside of Mr. 
 Struve) “means nothing”? Thosewho know very little, or nothing at all, of the “liberal andliberal-democratic trends” in Russia. 
 One asks, what should *At the League Congress Comrade Martov also adduced the fol-lowing argument against Comrade Plekhanov’s resolution: “The chiefobjection to it, the chief defect of this resolution, is that it totallyignores the fact that it is our duty, in the struggle against the auto-cracy, not to shun alliance with liberal-democratic elements. 
 Com-rade Lenin would call this a Martynov tendency. 
 This tendency isalready being manifested in the new Iskra ” (p. 
 88). 
 For the wealth of “gems” it contains this passage is indeed rare. 
 1) The phrase about alliance with the liberals is a sheer muddle. 
 No-body mentioned alliance, Comrade Martov, but only temporary or partial agreements. 
 That is an entirely different thing. 
 2) If Plekhanov’s resolution ignores an incredible “alliance” and speaks only of “support”in general, that is one of its merits, not a defect. 
 3) Perhaps ComradeMartov will take the trouble to explain what in general characterises“Martynov tendencies”? Perhaps he will tell us what is the relationbetween these tendencies and opportunism? Perhaps he will trace the relation of these tendencies to Paragraph 1 of the Rules? 4) I am just burning with impatience to hear from Comrade Martov how “Martynovtendencies” were manifested in the “new” Iskra . 
 Please, Comrade Martov, relieve me of the torments of suspense! be the attitude of our Party Congress to such workers: should it instruct Party members to acquaint these workers with the only definite liberal trend in Russia; or should it refrain from mentioning a name with which the workers are little acquainted because of their little acquaintance withpolitics? If Comrade Kostrov, having taken one step inthe wake of Comrade Akimov, does not want to take another,he will answer this question in the former sense. 
 And having answered it in the former sense, he will see how groundless his argument was. 
 At any rate , the words “Struve” and “Osvobozhdeniye ” in Plekhanov’s resolution are likely to be of much more value to the workers than the words “liberal and liberal-democratic trend” in Starover’s resolution. 
 Except through Osvobozhdeniye , the Russian worker can-not at the present time acquaint himself in practice with anything like a frank expression of the political tendenciesof our liberalism. 
 The legal liberal literature is unsuitablefor this purpose because it is so nebulous. 
 And we must asassiduously as possible (and among the broadest possiblemasses of workers) direct the weapon of our criticism against the Osvobozhdeniye gentry, so that when the future revolu-tion breaks out, the Russian proletariat may, with the realcriticism of weapons, 106 paralyse the inevitable attempts of the Osvobozhdeniye gentry to curtail the democratic charac-ter of the revolution. 
 Apart from Comrade Egorov’s “perplexity”, mentioned above, over the question of our “supporting” the oppositionaland revolutionary movement, the debate on the resolutionsoffered little of interest; in fact, there was hardly any debateat all. 
 The Congress ended with a brief reminder from the chair-man that its decisions were binding on all Party members. 
 N. 
 GENERAL PICTURE OF THE STRUGGLE AT THE CONGRESS. 
 THE REVOLUTIONARY AND OPPORTUNIST WINGS OF THE PARTY Having finished our analysis of the Congress debates and voting, we must now sum up, so that we may, on the basisof the entire Congress material, answer the question: what elements, groups, and shades went to make up the final majority and minority which we saw in the elections and which were destined for a time to become the main division in our Party? A summary must be made of all the materialrelating to shades of principle, theoretical and tactical,which the minutes of the Congress provide in such abundance. 
Without a general “resumé”, without a general picture ofthe Congress as a whole, and of all the principal groupings during the voting, this material is too disjointed, too disconnected, so that at first sight the individual groupingsseem accidental, especially to one who does not take thetrouble to make an independent and comprehensive study o f the Congress Minutes (and how many readers have takenthat trouble?). 
 In English parliamentary reports we often meet the characteristic word “division”. 
 The House “divided” intosuch and such a majority and minority, it is said when anissue is voted. 
 The “division” of our Social-DemocraticHouse on the various issues discussed at the Congress pre-sents a picture of the struggle within the Party, of its shades of opinion and groups, that is unique of its kind and unparal-leled for its completeness and accuracy . 
 To make the picture a graphic one, to obtain a real picture instead of a heap of disconnected, disjointed, and isolated facts and incidents,to put a stop to the endless and senseless arguments overparticular votings (who voted for whom and who supported whom?), I have decided to try to depict all the basic types of “divisions” at our Congress in the form of a diagram . 
 This will probably seem strange to a great many people, butI doubt whether any other method can be found that wouldreally generalise and summarise the results in the mostcomplete and accurate manner possible. 
 Which way a par-ticular delegate voted can be ascertained with absolute accuracy in cases when a roll-call vote was taken; and incertain important cases when no roll-call vote was takenit can be determined from the minutes with a very highdegree of probability, with a sufficient degree of approxima-tion to the truth. 
 And if we take into account all the roll-call votes and all the other votes on issues of any importance (as judged, for example, by the thoroughness and warmthof the debates), we shall obtain the most objective picture of our inner Party struggle that the material at our disposal permits. 
 In doing so, instead of giving a photograph, i. 
e. 
, an image of each voting separately, we shall try to give a picture, i. 
e. 
, to present all the main types of voting, ignoring relatively unimportant exceptions and variationswhich would only confuse matters. 
 In any case, anybodywill be able with the aid of the minutes to check every detailof our picture, to amplify it with any particular voting he likes, in short, to criticise it not only by arguing, express-ing doubts, and making references to isolated incidents, butby drawing a different picture on the basis of the same material. 
 In marking on the diagram each delegate who took part in the voting, we shall indicate by special shading the fourmain groups which we have traced in detail through the whole of the Congress debates, viz. 
, 1) the Iskra -ists of the majority; 2) the Iskra -ists of the minority; 3) the “Centre”, and 4) the anti-Iskra -ists. 
 We have seen the difference in shades of principle between these groups in a host of instances , and if anyone does not like the names of the groups, which remind lovers of zigzags too much of the Iskra organisation and the Iskra trend, we can tell them that it is not the name that matters. 
 Now that we have traced the shadesthrough all the debates at the Congress, it is easy to sub-stitute for the already established and familiar Partyappellations (which jar on the ears of some) a characterisa-tion of the essence of the shades between the groups . 
 Were this substitution made, we would obtain the following names for these same four groups: 1) consistent revolutionary Social-Democrats; 2) minor opportunists; 3) middling opportunists;and 4) major opportunists (major by our Russian standards). 
Let us hope that these names will be less shocking to thosewho have latterly taken to assuring themselves and others that Iskra -ist is a name which only denotes a “circle”, and not a trend . 
 Let us now explain in detail the types of voting “snapped” on this diagram (see diagram: General Picture of the Struggleat the Congress—p. 
 339). 
 The first type of voting (A) covers the cases when the “Centre” joined with the Iskra -ists against the anti-Iskra -ists or a part of them. 
 It includes the vote on the programmeas a whole (Comrade Akimov alone abstained, all the others voted for); the vote on the resolution condemning federa-tion in principle (all voted for except the five Bundists); the vote on Paragraph 2 of the Bund Rules (the five Bundists voted against us; five abstained, viz. 
: Martynov, Akimov,Brouckère, and Makhov with his two votes; the rest werewith us); it is this vote that is represented in diagram A . 
 Further, the three votes on the question of endorsing Iskra as the Party’s Central Organ were also of this type: the editors (five votes) abstained; in all three cases there were two votes against (Akimov and Brouckère), and, in addition,when the vote on the motives for endorsing Iskra was taken, the five Bundists and Comrade Martynov abstained. 
 * This type of voting provides the answer to a very inter-esting and important question, namely, when did the Con-gress “Centre” vote with the Iskra -ists? It was either when the anti-“Iskra” -ists , too, were with us , with a few exceptions (adoption of the programme, or endorsement of Iskra with-out motives stated), or else when it was a question of thesort of statement which was not in itself a direct committal to a definite political position (recognition of Iskra ’s orga-nising work was not in itself a committal to carry out its organisational policy in relation to particular groups; re-jection of the principle of federation did not preclude absten-tion from voting on a specific scheme of federation, as wehave seen in the case of Comrade Makhov). 
 We have alreadyseen, when speaking of the significance of the groupings at the Congress in general, how falsely this matter is put in the official account of the official Iskra , which (through the mouth of Comrade Martov) slurs and glosses over the difference between the Iskra -ists and the “Centre”, between consistent revolutionary Social-Democrats and opportunists,by citing cases when the anti-“Iskra ”-ists , too, voted with us ! Even the most “Right-wing” of the opportunists in the German *Why was the vote on Paragraph 2 of the Bund Rules taken for depiction in the diagram? Because the votes on endorsing Iskra were not as full, while the votes on the programme and on the questionof federation referred to political decisions of a less definite and spe-cific character. 
 Speaking generally, the choice of one or another of a number of votes of the same type will not in the least affect the main features of the picture, as anyone may easily see by making the cor-responding changes. 
 and French Social-Democratic parties never vote against such points as the adoption of the programme as a whole . 
 The second type of voting (B) covers the cases when the Iskra -ists, consistent and inconsistent, voted together against all the anti-Iskra -ists and the entire “Centre”. 
 These were mostly cases that involved giving effect to definiteand specific plans of the Iskra policy, that is, endorsing Iskra in fact and not only in word . 
 They include the Organis-ing Committee incident *; the question of making the position of the Bund in the Party the first item on the agenda; thedissolution of the Yuzhny Rabochy group; two votes on the agrarian programme, and, sixthly and lastly, the voteagainst the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad (Rabocheye Dyelo ), that is, the recognition of the League as the only Party organisation abroad. 
 The old, pre-Party,circle spirit, the interests of opportunist organisationsor groups, the narrow conception of Marxism were fightinghere against the strictly consistent and principled policyof revolutionary Social-Democracy; the Iskra -ists of the minority still sided with us in quite a number of cases,in a number of exceedingly important votes (importantfrom the standpoint of the Organising Committee, Yuzhny Rabochy , and Rabocheye Dyelo ) ... until their own circle spirit and their own inconsistency came into question. 
The “divisions” of this type bring out with graphic claritythat on a number of issues involving the practical appli-cation of our principles, the Centre joined forces with the anti-“Iskra ”-ists , displaying a much greater kinship with them than with us, a much greater leaning in practice *It is this vote that is depicted in Diagram B, the Iskra -ists secured thirty-two votes, the Bundist resolution sixteen. 
 It should be pointed out that of the votes of this type not one was by roll-call . 
 The way the individual delegates voted can only be established—but with a very high degree of probability—by two sets of evidence: 1) in the debate the speakers of both groups of Iskra -ists spoke in favour, those of the anti-Iskra -ists and the “Centre” against; 2) the number of votes cast in favour was always very close to thirty-three. 
 Nor should it be forgotten that when analysing the Congress debates we pointedout, quite apart from the voting, a number of cases when the “Centre” sided with the anti-Iskra -ists (the opportunists) against us. 
 Some of these issues were: the absolute value of democratic demands, whetherwe should support the oppositional elements, restriction of centralism, etc.

 Those who were Iskra -ists in name but were ashamed to be Iskra -ists revealed their true nature, and the struggle that inevitably ensued caused no littleacrimony, which obscured from the less thoughtful andmore impressionable the significance of the shades of prin-ciple disclosed in that struggle. 
 But now that the ardourof battle has somewhat abated and the minutes remain as a dispassionate extract of a series of heated encounters, only those who wilfully close their eyes can fail to perceivethat the alliance of the Makhovs and Egorovs with theAkimovs and Liebers was not, and could not be, fortuitous. 
The only thing Martov and Axelrod can do is keep wellaway from a comprehensive and accurate analysis of the minutes, or try at this late date to undo their behaviour at the Congress by all sorts of expressions of regret . 
 As if regrets can remove differences of views and differencesof policy! As if the present alliance of Martov and Axelrodwith Akimov, Brouckère, and Martynov can cause our Party,restored at the Second Congress, to forget the struggle which the Iskra -ists waged with the anti-Iskra -ists almost through-out the Congress! The distinguishing feature of the third type of voting at the Congress, represented by the three remaining parts ofthe diagram (C, D, and E), is that a small section of the “Iskra ”-ists broke away and went over to the anti-“Iskra ”-ists , who accordingly gained the victory (as long as they remained at the Congress). 
 In order to trace with complete accuracythe development of this celebrated coalition of the Iskra -ist minority with the anti-Iskra -ists, the mere mention of which drove Martov to write hysterical epistles at theCongress, we have reproduced all the three main kinds of roll-call votes of this type. 
 C is the vote on equality of languages (the last of the three roll-call votes on this questionis given, it being the fullest). 
 All the anti-Iskra -ists and the whole Centre stand solid against us; from the Iskra -ists a part of the majority and a part of the minority breakaway. 
 It is not yet clear which of the “Iskra ”-ists are capable of forming a definite and lasting coalition with the opportunist “Right wing ” of the Congress . 
 Next comes type D—the vote on Paragraph 1 of the Rules (of the two votes, we have taken the one which was more clear-cut, that is, in which there were no abstentions). 
 The coalition stands out more saliently and assumes firmer shape *: all the Iskra -ists of the minority are now on the side of Akimov and Lieber,but only a very small number of Iskra -ists of the majority, these counterbalancing three of the “Centre” and one anti-Iskra -ist who have come over to our side. 
 A mere glance at the diagram suffices to show which elements shifted from side to side casually and temporarily and which were drawn with irresistible force towards a lasting coalition with the Akimovs . 
 The last vote (E—elections to the Central Organ, the Central Committee, and the Party Council), which in fact represents the final division into majority and minority , clearly reveals the complete fusion of the Iskra -ist minority with the entire “Centre” and the remnants of the anti-Iskra -ists. 
 By this time, of the eight anti-Iskra -ists, only Comrade Brouckère remained at the Congress (Comrade Akimov hadalready explained his mistake to him and he had taken hisproper place in the ranks of the Martovites ). 
 The withdrawal of the seven most “Right-wing ” of the opportunists decided the issue of the elections against Martov. 
 ** And now, with the aid of the objective evidence of votes of every type , let us sum up the results of the Congress. 
 There has been much talk to the effect that the majority at our Congress was “ accidental ”. 
 This, in fact, was Comrade Martov’s sole consolation in his Once More in the Minority . 
 *Judging by all indications , four other votes on the Rules were of the same type: p. 
 278—27 for Fomin, as against 21 for us; p. 
 279—26 for Martov, as against 24 for us; p. 
 280—27 against me, 22 for; and,on the same page, 24 for Martov, as against 23 for us. 
 These are thevotes on the question of co-optation to the central bodies, which Ihave already dealt with. 
 No roll-call votes are available (there wasone, but the record of it has been lost). 
 The Bundists (all or part) evi-dently saved Martov. 
 Martov’s erroneous statements (at the League) concerning these votes have been corrected above. 
 **The seven opportunists who withdrew from the Second Congress were the five Bundists (the Bund withdrew from the Party after theSecond Congress rejected the principle of federation) and two Ra-bocheye Dyelo -ists, Comrade Martynov and Comrade Akimov. 
 These latter left the Congress after the Iskra -ist League was recognised as the only Party organisation abroad, i. 
e. 
, after the Rabocheye Dyelo -ist Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad was dissolved. 
 (Author’sfootnote to the 1907 edition. 
— Ed. 
) The diagram clearly shows that in one sense , but in only one, the majority could be called accidental, viz. 
, in the sense that the withdrawal of the seven most opportunist dele-gates of the “ Right ” was—supposedly—a matter of accident . 
 To the extent that this withdrawal was an accident (and no more), our majority was accidental. 
 A mere glance at thediagram will show better than any long arguments on whoseside these seven would have been, were bound to have been . 
 * But the question is: how far was the withdrawal of the seven really an accident? That is a question which those whotalk so freely about the “accidental” character of the ma-jority do not like to ask themselves. 
 It is an unpleasant ques-tion for them. 
 Was it an accident that the most extremerepresentatives of the Right and not of the Left wing of our Party were the ones to withdraw? Was it an accident that it was opportunist s who withdrew, and not consistent revolutionary Social-Democrats ? Is there no connection be-tween this “accidental” withdrawal and the struggle againstthe opportunist wing which was waged throughout theCongress and which stands out so graphically in our diagram? One has only to ask these questions, which are so unpleas-ant to the minority, to realise what fact all this talk aboutthe accidental character of the majority is intended toconceal . 
 It is the unquestionable and incontrovertible fact that the minority was formed of those in our Party who grav-itate most towards opportunism . 
 The minority was formed of those elements in the Party who are least stable in theory, least steadfast in matters of principle . 
 It was from the Right wing of the Party that the minority was formed. 
 The divi-sion into majority and minority is a direct and inevitablecontinuation of that division of the Social-Democratsinto a revolutionary and an opportunist wing, into a Mountain and a Gironde, 107 which did not appear only yesterday, nor in the Russian workers’ party alone, andwhich no doubt will not disappear tomorrow. 
 This fact is of cardinal importance for elucidating the causes and the various stages of our disagreements. 
 Who-*We shall see later that after the Congress both Comrade Akimov and the Voronezh Committee, which has the closest kinship with Com-rade Akimov, explicitly expressed their sympathy with the “ minor-ity”. 
 ever tries to evade the fact by denying or glossing over the struggle at the Congress and the shades of principle that it revealed, simply testifies to his own intellectual and political poverty. 
 And in order to disprove the fact, it would have to be shown, in the first place , that the general picture of the voting and “divisions” at our Party Congress wasdifferent from the one I have drawn; and, in the second place , that it was the most consistent revolutionary Social-Democrats, those who in Russia have adopted the name of Iskra -ists, * who were in the wrong on the substance of all those issues over which the Congress “divided”. 
 Well,just try to show that, gentlemen! Incidentally, the fact that the minority was formed of the most opportunist, the least stable and consistent ele-ments of the Party provides an answer to those numerous objections and expressions of doubt which are addressedto the majority by people who are imperfectly acquaintedwith the matter, or have not given it sufficient thought. 
Is it not petty, we are told, to account for the divergence by a minor mistake of Comrade Martov and Comrade Axel-rod? Yes, gentlemen, Comrade Martov’s mistake was a minor one (and I said so even at the Congress, in the heat ofthe struggle); but this minor mistake could (and did ) cause a lot of harm because Comrade Martov was pulled overto the side of delegates who had made a whole series of mistakes , had manifested an inclination towards opportun-ism and inconsistency of principle on a whole series of *Note for Comrade Martov’s benefit. 
 If Comrade Martov has now forgotten that the term “ Iskra ”-ist implies the follower of a trend a nd not a member of a circle , we would advise him to read in the Congress Minutes the explanation Comrade Trotsky gave Comrade Akimov on this point. 
 There were three Iskra -ist circles (in relation to the Party) at the Congress: the Emancipation of Labour group, the Iskra editor-ial board, and the Iskra organisation. 
 Two of these three circles had the good sense to dissolve themselves; the third did not display enoughParty spirit to do so, and was dissolved by the Congress. 
 The broadestof the Iskra -ist circles, the Iskra organisation (which included the editorial board and the Emancipation of Labour group), had sixteen members present at the Congress in all, of whom only eleven were entitled to vote. 
 Iskra -ists by trend , on the other hand, not by member-ship in any Iskra -ist “circle”, numbered, by my calculation, twenty-seven , with thirty-three votes . 
 Hence, less than half of the Iskra -ists at the Congress belonged to Iskra -ist circles . 
 questions. 
 That Comrade Martov and Comrade Axelrod should have displayed instability was an unimportant fact concerning individuals; it was not an individual fact, however, but a Party fact, and a not altogether unimportant one, that a very considerable minority should have been formed of all the least stable elements, of all who either rejected Iskra ’s trend altogether and openly opposed it, or paid lip service to it but actually sided time and again with the anti-Iskra -ists. 
 Is it not absurd to account for the divergence by the prevalence of an inveterate circle spirit and revolutionaryphilistinism in the small circle comprised by the old Iskra editorial board? No, it is not absurd, because all those in our Party who all through the Congress had fought for every kind of circle , all those who were generally incapable of rising above revolutionary philistinism, all those who talked about the “historical” character of the philistineand circle spirit in order to justify and preserve that evil,rose up in support of this particular circle. 
 The fact that nar-row circle interests prevailed over the Party interest in the one little circle of the Iskra editorial board might, perhaps, be regarded as an accident; but it was no accident that instaunch support of this circle rose up the Akimovs andBrouckères, who attached no less (if not more) value to the“historical continuity” of the celebrated Voronezh Committeeand the notorious St. 
 Petersburg “Workers’ Organisation” 108; the Egorovs, who lamented the “murder” of Rabocheye Dyelo as bitterly as the “murder” of the old editorial board (ifnot more so); the Makhovs, etc. 
, etc. 
 You can tell a manby his friends—the proverb says. 
 And you can tell a man’spolitical complexion by his political allies, by the people who vote for him. 
 The minor mistake committed by Comrade Martov and Comrade Axelrod was, and might have remained, a minor one until it became the starting-point for a durable alliance between them and the whole opportunist wing of our Party,until it led, as a result of that alliance, to a recrudescence of opportunism, to the exaction of revenge by all whom Iskra had fought and who were now overjoyed at a chance of vent-ing their spleen on the consistent adherents of revolutionary Social-Democracy. 
 And as a result of the post-Congress events, what we are witnessing in the new Iskra is precisely a recrudescence of opportunism, the revenge of the Akimovs and Brouckères (see the leaflet issued by the Voronezh Committee *), and the glee of the Martynovs, who have at last (at last!) been allowed, in the detested Iskra , to have a kick at the detested “enemy” for each and every formergrievance. 
 This makes it particularly clear how essentialit was to “restore Iskra ’s old editorial board” (we are quot-ing from Comrade Starover’s ultimatum of November 3, 1903) in order to preserve Iskra “continuity”.... 
 Taken by itself, there was nothing dreadful, nor critical, nor even anything abnormal in the fact that the Congress(and the Party) divided into a Left and a Right, a revolu-tionary and an opportunist wing. 
 On the contrary, the whole past decade in the history of the Russian (and not only the Russian) Social-Democratic movement had been lead-ing inevitably and inexorably to such a division. 
 Thefact that the division took place over a number of veryminor mistakes of the Right wing, of (relatively) very un-important differences (a fact which seems shocking to the superficial observer and to the philistine mind), marked a big step forward for our Party as a whole . 
 Formerly we used to differ over major issues, such as might in some caseseven justify a split; now we have reached agreement on allmajor and important points, and are only divided by shades , about which we may and should argue, but over which it would be absurd and childish to part company (as Comrade Plekhanov has quite rightly said in his interesting article“What Should Not Be Done”, to which we shall revert). 
Now , when the anarchistic behaviour of the minority since the Congress has almost brought the Party to a split, one may often hear wiseacres saying: Was it worth while fighting at the Congress over such trifles as the Organising Committee incident, the dissolution of the Yuzhny Rabochy group or Rabocheye Dyelo , or Paragraph 1, or the dissolution of the old editorial board, etc. 
? Those who argue in this way ** *See pp. 
 406-07 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 **I cannot help recalling in this connection a conversation I hap-pened to have at the Congress with one of the “Centre” delegates. 
 “Howoppressive the atmosphere is at our Congress!” he complained. 
 “Thisbitter fighting, this agitation of one against the other, this biting are in fact introducing the circle standpoint into Party affairs: a struggle of shades in the Party is inevitable and essential , as long as it does not lead to anarchy and splits, as long as it is confined within bounds approved by the common consent of all comrades and Party members. 
 And our struggle against the Right wing of the Party at the Congress , against Akimov and Axelrod, Martynov and Martov, in no way exceeded those bounds . 
 One need only recall two facts which incontrovertibly prove this: 1) when Comrades Martynov and Akimov were about to quit the Congress, we were all prepared to do everything to obliterate the idea of an “insult”; we all adopted (by thirty-two votes) Comrade Trotsky’s motion inviting these comrades to regard the explanationsas satisfactory and withdraw their statement; 2) when it came to the election of the central bodies, we were prepared to allow the minority (or the opportunist wing) of the Con-gress a minority on both central bodies : Martov on the Central Organ and Popov on the Central Committee. 
 We could not act otherwise from the Party standpoint, since even beforethe Congress we had decided to elect two trios. 
 If the differ-ence of shades revealed at the Congress was not great , neither was the practical conclusion we drew from the struggle between these shades: the conclusion amounted solely t o this, that two-thirds of the seats on both bodies of three ought to be given to the majority at the Party Congress. 
 It was only the refusa l of the minority at the Party Con-gress to be a minority on the central bodies that led first to the “feeble whining” of defeated intellectuals, and then toanarchistic talk and anarchistic actions. 
 In conclusion, let us take one more glance at the diagram from the standpoint of the composition of the centralbodies. 
 Quite naturally, in addition to the question of shades, controversy, this uncomradely attitude!...” “What a splendid thing our Congress is!” I replied. 
 “A free and open struggle. 
 Opinions have beenstated. 
 The shades have been revealed. 
 The groups have taken shape. 
Hands have been raised. 
 A decision has been taken. 
 A stage has been passed. 
 Forward! That’s the stuff for me! That’s life! That’s not like the endless, tedious word-chopping of your intellectuals, which stopsnot because the question has been settled, but because they are tootired to talk any more.... 
” The comrade of the “Centre” stared at me in perplexity and shrugged his shoulders. 
 We were talking different languages. 
 the delegates were faced during the elections with the ques-tion of the suitability , efficiency, etc. 
, of one or another per-son. 
 The minority are now very prone to confuse these two questions. 
 Yet that they are different questions is self-evident, and this can be seen from the simple fact, forinstance, that the election of an initial trio for the Central Organ had been planned even before the Congress , at a time when no one could have foreseen the alliance of Martov and Axelrod with Martynov and Akimov. 
 Different questions have to be answered in different ways: the answer to thequestion of shades must be sought for in the minutes of the Congress , in the open discussions and voting on each and every issue. 
 As to the question of the suitability of persons , everybody at the Congress had decided that it should be settled by secret ballot . 
 Why did the whole Congress unanimous-ly take that decision? The question is so elementary that it would be odd to dwell on it. 
 But (since their defeat atthe ballot-box) the minority have begun to forget evenelementary things. 
 We have heard torrents of ardent, pas-sionate speeches, heated almost to the point of irresponsi-bility, in defence of the old editorial board, but we have heard absolutely nothing about the shades at the Congress that were involved in the struggle over a board of six orthree. 
 We hear talk and gossip on all sides about the in-effectualness, the unsuitability, the evil designs, etc. 
, of thepersons elected to the Central Committee, but we hear absolutely nothing about the shades at the Congress that fought for predominance on the Central Committee. 
 To me it seemsindecent and discreditable to go about talking and gossipingoutside the Congress about the qualities and actions of indi-viduals (for in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred these actionsare an organisational secret, which can only be divulged to the supreme authority of the Party). 
 To fight outside the Congress by means of such gossip would, in my opinion, be scandal-mongering . 
 And the only public reply I could make to all this talk would be to point to the struggle at theCongress: You say that the Central Committee was electedby a narrow majority. 
 That is true. 
 But this narrow majority consisted of all who had most consistently fought, not in words but in actual fact, for the realisation of the Iskra plans. 
 Consequently, the moral prestige of this majority should be even higher—incomparably so—than its formal prestige—higher in the eyes of all who value the continuity of the Iskra trend above the continuity of a particular Iskra circle . 
 Who was more competent to judge the suitability of particular persons to carry out the Iskra policy—those who fought for that policy at the Congress, or those who in nofew cases fought against that policy and defended every-thing retrograde, every kind of old rubbish, every kind of circle mentality? O. 
 AFTER THE CONGRESS. 
 TWO METHODS OF STRUGGLE The analysis of the debates and voting at the Congress, which we have now concluded, actually explains in nuce (in embryo) everything that has happened since the Congress , and we can be brief in outlining the subsequent stages ofour Party crisis. 
 The refusal of Martov and Popov to stand for election immediately introduced an atmosphere of squabbling into a Party struggle between Party shades. 
 On the very next day after the Congress, Comrade Glebov, thinking it incrediblethat the unelected editors could seriously have decided toswing towards Akimov and Martynov, and attributing the whole thing primarily to irritation, suggested to Plekhanovand me that the matter should be ended peaceably and that all four should be “co-opted” on condition that proper representation of the editorial board on the Council wasguaranteed (i. 
e. 
, that of the two representatives, one wasdefinitely drawn from the Party majority). 
 This condition seemed sound to Plekhanov and me, for its acceptance wouldimply a tacit admission of the mistake at the Congress , a desire for peace instead of war, a desire to be closer to Plekhanov and me than to Akimov and Martynov, Egorovand Makhov. 
 The concession as regards “co-optation”thus became a personal one, and it was not worth while refusing to make a personal concession which should clearaway the irritation and restore peace. 
 Plekhanov and I therefore consented. 
 But the editorial majority rejected the condition. 
 Glebov left . 
 We began to wait and see what would happen next: whether Martov would adhere to the loyal stand he had taken up at the Congress ( against Com-rade Popov, the representative of the Centre), or whether the unstable elements who inclined towards a split, and in whose wake he had followed, would gain the upper hand. 
 We were faced with the question: would Comrade Martov choose to regard his Congress “coalition” as an isolatedpolitical fact (just as, si licet parva componere magnis , * Bebel’s coalition with Vollmar in 1895 was an isolated case), or would he want to consolidate this coalition, exert himself to prove that it was Plekhanov and I who were mistaken at the Congress, and become the actual leader of the opportun-ist wing of our Party? This question might be formulatedotherwise as follows: a squabble or a political Party strug-gle? Of the three of us who on the day after the Congress were the sole available members of the central institutions, Glebov inclined most to the former answer and made themost efforts to reconcile the children who had fallen out. 
Comrade Plekhanov inclined most to the latter answerand was, as the saying goes, neither to hold nor to bind. 
I on this occasion acted the part of “Centre”, or “Marsh”, and endeavoured to employ persuasion. 
 To try at this date to recall the spoken attempts at persuasion would be a hope-lessly muddled business, and I shall not follow the badexample of Comrade Martov and Comrade Plekhanov. 
 ButI do consider it necessary to reproduce certain passagesfrom one written attempt at persuasion which I addressed to one of the “minority” Iskra -ists: “...The refusal of Martov to serve on the editorial board, his refusal and that of other Party writers to collaborate,the refusal of a number of persons to work on the CentralCommittee, and the propaganda of a boycott or passiveresistance are bound to lead, even if against the wishes of Martov and his friends, to a split in the Party. 
 Even if Mar-tov adheres to a loyal stand (which he took up so resolutelyat the Congress), others will not, and the outcome I havementioned will be inevitable.... 
 “And so I ask myself: over what, in point of fact, would we be parting company?... I go over all the events and impressions of the Congress; I realise that I often behaved *If little things may be compared to big. 
— Ed. 
 and acted in a state of frightful irritation, ‘frenziedly’; I am quite willing to admit this fault of mine to anyone, if that can be called a fault which was a natural product of the atmosphere, the reactions, the interjections, thestruggle, etc. 
 But examining now, quite unfrenziedly, theresults attained, the outcome achieved by frenzied struggle,I can detect nothing, absolutely nothing in these results thatis injurious to the Party, and absolutely nothing that is an affront or insult to the minority. 
 “Of course, the very fact of finding oneself in the minority could not but be vexatious, but I categorically protestagainst the idea that we ‘cast slurs’ on anybody, that wewanted to insult or humiliate anybody. 
 Nothing of the kind. 
 And one should not allow political differences to lead to an interpretation of events based on accusing the other side of unscrupulousness, chicanery, intrigue, and the other nicethings we are hearing mentioned more and more often inthis atmosphere of an impending split. 
 This should notbe allowed, for it is, to say the least, the nec plus ultra o f irrationality. 
 “Martov and I have had a political (and organisational) difference, as we had dozens of times before. 
 Defeated overParagraph 1 of the Rules, I could not but strive with allmy might for revanche in what remained to me (and to the Congress). 
 I could not but strive, on the one hand, for astrictly Iskra -ist Central Committee, and, on the other, for a trio on the editorial board.... 
 I consider this trio the only one capable of being an official institution, instead of a body based on indulgence and slackness, the only oneto be a real centre, each member of which would alwaysstate and defend his Party viewpoint, not one grain more,and irrespective of all personal considerations and all fear of giving offence, of resignations, and so on. 
 “This trio, after what had occurred at the Congress, un-doubtedly meant legitimising a political and organisationalline in one respect directed against Martov. 
 Undoubtedly. 
Cause a rupture on that account? Break up the Party becauseof it?? Did not Martov and Plekhanov oppose me over the question of demonstrations? And did not Martov and I oppose Plekhanov over the question of the programme?Is not one side of every trio always up against the other two? If the majority of the Iskra -ists, both in the Iskra organisation and at the Congress, found this particular shade of Martov’s line organisationally and politically mistaken, is it not really senseless to attempt to attributethis to ‘intrigue’, ‘incitement’, and so forth? Would itnot be senseless to try to talk away this fact by abusing the majority and calling them ‘riffraff’? “I repeat that, like the majority of the Iskra -ists at the Congress, I am profoundly convinced that the line Martov adopted was wrong, and that he had to be corrected. 
 Totake offence at this correction, to regard it as an insult, etc. 
,is unreasonable. 
 We have not cast, and are not casting, any‘slurs’ on anyone, nor are we excluding anyone from work . 
 And to cause a split because someone has been excluded from a central body seems to me a piece of inconceivable folly. 
” * I have thought it necessary to recall these written state-ments of mine now, because they conclusively prove that the majority wanted to draw a definite line at once between possible (and in a heated struggle inevitable) personal grievances and personal irritations caused by biting and “frenzied” attacks, etc. 
, on the one hand, and a definitepolitical mistake, a definite political line (coalition with theRight wing), on the other. 
 These statements prove that the passive resistance of the minority began immediately after the Congress and-at once evoked from us the warning that it was a step towards split-ting the Party ; the warning that it ran directly counter to their declarations of loyalty at the Congress ; that the split would be solely over the fact of exclusion from the central institutions (that is, non-election to them), for nobody ever thought of excluding any Party member from work ; and that our political difference (an inevitable difference, inasmuch as it had not yet been elucidated and settled which line at *This letter (to A. 
 N. 
 Potresov, of August 31 [September 13], 1903— Ed. 
) was written in September (New Style). 
 I have only omitted what seemed to me irrelevant to the matter in hand. 
 If the addressee considers what I have omitted important, he can easily repair the omission. 
 Incidentally, let me take this opportunity to say that anyof my opponents may publish any of my private letters should theythink a useful purpose will be served by it. 
 the Congress was mistaken, Martov’s or ours) was being per-verted more and more into a squabble , accompanied by abuse, suspicions, and so on and so forth. 
 But the warnings were in vain. 
 The behaviour of the minority showed that the least stable elements among them,those who least valued the Party , were gaining the upper hand. 
 This compelled Plekhanov and me to withdraw theconsent we had given to Glebov’s proposal. 
 For if the minor-ity were demonstrating by their deeds their political insta-bility not only as regards principles, but even as regardselementary Party loyalty , what value could be attached to their talk about this celebrated “continuity”? Nobody scoffed more wittily than Plekhanov at the utter absurdityof demanding the “co-optation” to the Party editorial board of a majority consisting of people who frankly proclaimed their new and growing differences of opinion! Has there everbeen a case in the world of a party majority on the centralinstitutions converting itself into a minority of its ownaccord, prior to the airing of new differences in the press, in full view of the Party? Let the differences first be stated, let the Party judge how profound and important they were, let the Party itself correct the mistake it had made at theSecond Congress, should it be shown that it had made a mis-take! The very fact that such a demand was made on the plea of differences still unknown demonstrated the utter instabil-ity of those who made it, the complete submersion of polit-ical differences by squabbling, and their entire disrespect both for the Party as a whole and for their own convictions. 
Never have there been, nor will there be, persons of con-vinced principle who refuse to try to convince before they secure ( privately ) a majority in the institution they want to bring round to their standpoint. 
 Finally, on October 4, Comrade Plekhanov announced that he would make a last attempt to put an end to this absurd state of affairs A meeting was called of all the sixmembers of the old editorial board, attended by a new member of the Central Committee. 
 * Comrade Plekhanov *This Central Committee member109 arranged, in addition, a number of private and collective talks with the minority, in which he refuted the preposterous tales that were being spread and appealedto their sense of Party duty. 
 spent three whole hours proving how unreasonable it was to demand “co-optation” of four of the “minority” to two of the “majority”. 
 He proposed co-opting two of them , so as, on the one hand, to remove all fears that we wanted to “bully”,suppress, besiege, behead or bury anyone, and, on the other,to safeguard the rights and position of the Party “majority”. 
The co-optation of two was likewise rejected. 
 On October 6, Plekhanov and I wrote the following official letter to all the old editors of Iskra and to Comrade Trotsky, one of its contributors: “Dear Comrades, “The editorial board of the Central Organ considers it its duty officially to express its regret at your withdrawalfrom participation in Iskra and Zarya . 
 In spite of the repeated invitations to collaborate which we made to youimmediately following the Second Party Congress and several times after, we have not received a single contribu-tion from you. 
 The editors of the Central Organ declarethat your withdrawal from participation is not justified byanything they have done. 
 No personal irritation should serve,of course, as an obstacle to your working on the CentralOrgan of the Party. 
 If, on the other hand, your withdrawal is due to any differences of opinion with us, we would con-sider it of the greatest benefit to the Party if you were toset forth these differences at length. 
 More, we would considerit highly desirable for the nature and depth of these differ-ences to be explained to the whole Party as early as possiblein the columns of the publications of which we are the editors. 
” * As the reader sees, it was still quite unclear to us whether the actions of the “minority” were principally governed by personal irritation or by a desire to steer the organ (and theParty) along a new course , and if so, what course exactly. 
 I think that if we were even now to set seventy wise men *The letter to Comrade Martov contained in addition a reference to a certain pamphlet and the following sentence: “Lastly, we oncemore inform you, in the interests of the work, that we are still pre-pared to co-opt you to the editorial board of the Central Organ, inorder to give you every opportunity officially to state and defend your views in the supreme institution of the Party. 
” to elucidate this question with the help of any literature or any testimony you like, they too could make nothing of this tangle. 
 I doubt whether a squabble can ever be disentangled: you have either to cut it, or set it aside. 
 * Axelrod, Zasulich, Starover, Trotsky, and Koltsov sent a couple of lines in reply to this letter of October 6, to theeffect that the undersigned were taking no part in Iskra since its passage into the hands of the new editorial board. 
 Comrade Martov was more communicative and honoured us with the following reply: “To the Editorial Board of the, Central Organ of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 “Dear Comrades, “In reply to your letter of October 6 I wish to state the following: I consider all our discussions on the subject of working together on oneorgan at an end after the conference which took place in the presenceof a Central Committee member on October 4, and at which you refusedto state the reasons that induced you to withdraw your proposal to usthat Axelrod, Zasulich, Starover, and I should join the editorial board on condition that we undertook to elect Comrade Lenin our ‘rep-resentative’ on the Council. 
 After you repeatedly evaded at this con-ference formulating the statements you had yourselves made in thepresence of witnesses, I do not think it necessary to explain in a letterto you my motives for refusing to work on Iskra under present condi-tions. 
 Should the need arise, I shall explain them in detail to the whole Party, which will already be able to learn from the minutes of the Second Congress why I rejected the proposal, which you now repeat,that I accept a seat on the editorial board and on the Council.... 
 ** “L. 
 Martov ” This letter, in conjunction with the previous documents, clarifies beyond any possible dispute that question of boycott, disorganisation, anarchy, and preparations for a split which Comrade Martov (with the help of exclamation marks androws of dots) so assiduously evades in his State of Siege—the question of loyal and disloyal methods of struggle. 
 Comrade Martov and the others are invited to set forth their differences, they are asked to tell us plainly what the trouble is all about and what their intentions are, they are exhorted to stop sulking and to analyse calmly the mis-*Comrade Plekhanov would probably add: “or satisfy each and every claim of the initiators of the squabble”. 
 We shall see why this was impossible. 
 **I omit what Martov replied in reference to his pamphlet, then being republished. 
 take made over Paragraph 1 (which is intimately connected with their mistake in swinging to the Right)—but Comrade Martov and Co. 
 refuse to talk , and cry: “We are being besieged! We are being bullied!” The jibe about “dreadful words”has not cooled the ardour of these comical outcries. 
 How is it possible to besiege someone who r efuses to work together with you ?—we asked Comrade Martov. 
 How is it pos-sible to ill-treat, “bully”, and oppress a minority which refuses to be a minority ? Being in the minority necessarily and inevitably involves certain disadvantages. 
 These disad-vantages are that you either have to join a body which willoutvote you on certain questions, or you stay outside thatbody and attack it, and consequently come under the fireof well-mounted batteries. 
 Did Comrade Martov’s cries about a “state of siege” mean that those in the minority were being fought or governedunfairly and unloyally? Only such an assertion could have contained even a grain of sense (in Martov’s eyes), for,I repeat, being in the minority necessarily and inevi-tably involves certain disadvantages. 
 But the whole comedy of the matter is that Comrade Martov could not be fought at all as long as he refused to talk! The minority could not be governed at all as long as they refused to be a minority! Comrade Martov could not cite a single fact to show that the editorial board of the Central Organ had exceeded orabused its powers while Plekhanov and I were on it. 
 Nor could the practical workers of the minority cite a single fact of a like kind with regard to the Central Committee. 
 However Comrade Martov may now twist and turn in his State of Siege , it remains absolutely incontrovertible that the outcries about a state of siege were nothing but “feeble whining ”. 
 How utterly Comrade Martov and Co. 
 lacked sensible arguments against the editorial board appointed by the Congress is best of all shown by their own catchword: “We are not serfs!” ( State of Siege , p. 
 34. 
) The mentality of the bourgeois intellectual, who counts himself among the “elect minds” standing above mass organisation and mass discipline, is expressed here with remarkable clarity. 
 To explain their refusal to work in the Party by saying that they “are not serfs” is to give themselves away completely , to confess to a total lack of arguments, an utter inability to furnish any motives, any sensible reasons for dissatis-faction. 
 Plekhanov and I declare that their refusal is not justified by anything we have done; we request them to setforth their differences; and all they reply is: “We are notserfs” (adding that no bargain has yet been reached on thesubject of co-optation). 
 To the individualism of the intellectual, which already manifested itself in the controversy over Paragraph 1, revealing its tendency to opportunist argument and anar-chistic phrase-mongering; all proletarian organisation and discipline seems to be serfdom . 
 The reading public will soon learn that in the eyes of these “Party members” andParty “officials” even a new Party Congress is a serf institu-tion that is terrible and abhorrent to the “elect minds”.... 
 This “institution” is indeed terrible to people who are notaverse to making use of the Party title but are consciousthat this title of theirs does not accord with the interests and will of the Party. 
 The committee resolutions enumerated in my letter to the editors of the new Iskra , and published by Comrade Martov in his State of Siege, show with facts that the behav-iour of the minority amounted all along to sheer disobedience of the decisions of the Congress and disorganisation of posi-tive practical work. 
 Consisting of opportunists and peoplewho detested Iskra , the minority strove to rend the Party and damaged and disorganised its work, thirsting to avenge their defeat at the Congress and sensing that by honest and loyal means (by explaining their case in the press or at a congress) they would never succeed in refuting the accusa-tion of opportunism and intellectualist instability whichat the Second Congress had been levelled against them. 
 Realising that they could not convince the Party, they tried to gain their ends by disorganising the Party and hampering all its work . 
 They were reproached with having (by their mistakes at the Congress) caused a crack in our pot; they replied to the reproach by trying with all their might to smash the pot altogether . 
 So distorted had their ideas become that boycott and refusal to work were proclaimed to be “ honest * methods” *Mining Area resolution ( State of Siege , p. 
 38). 
 of struggle. 
 Comrade Martov is now wriggling all around this delicate point. 
 Comrade Martov is such a “man of principle” that he defends boycott ... when practised by the minority, but condemns boycott when, his side happen-ing to have become the majority, it threatens Martov him-self! We need not, I think, go into the question whether this is a squabble or a “difference of principle” as to what are honest methods of struggle in a Social-Democratic workers’ party. 
 After the unsuccessful attempts (of October 4 and 6) to obtain an explanation from the comrades who had startedthe “co-optation” row, nothing remained for the central institutions but to wait and see what would come of their verbal assurances that they would adhere to loyal methodsof struggle. 
 On October 10, the Central Committee addresseda circular letter to the League (see League Minutes, pp. 
 3-5),announcing that it was engaged in drafting Rules for theLeague and inviting the League members to assist. 
 The Administration of the League had at that time decided against a congress of that body (by two votes to one; ibid . 
, p. 
 20). 
 The replies received from minority supporters tothis circular showed at once that the celebrated promise tobe loyal and abide by the decisions of the Congress wasjust talk, and that, as a matter of fact, the minority had positively decided not to obey the central institutions of the Party, replying to their appeals to collaborate withevasive excuses full of sophistry and anarchistic phrase-mongering. 
 In reply to the famous open letter of Deutsch, amember of the Administration (p. 
 10), Plekhanov, myself,and other supporters of the majority expressed our vigorous “protest against the gross violations of Party discipline by which an official of the League permits himself to hamperthe organisational activities of a Party institution and callsupon other comrades likewise to violate discipline and theRules. 
 Remarks such as, ‘I do not consider myself at libertyto take part in such work on the invitation of the Central Committee’, or, ‘Comrades, we must on no account allow it [The Central Committee] to draw up new Rules for theLeague’, etc. 
, are agitational methods of a kind that can only arouse disgust in anyone who has the slightest concep-tion of the meaning of the words party, organisation, and party discipline. 
 Such methods are all the more disgraceful for the fact that they are being used against a newly createdParty institution and are therefore an undoubted attemptto undermine confidence in it among Party comrades, andthat, moreover, they are being employed under the cachetof a member of the League Administration and behind the back of the Central Committee. 
” (P. 
 17. 
) Under such conditions, the League Congress promised to be nothing but a brawl. 
 From the outset, Comrade Martov continued his Congress tactics of “getting personal”, this time with Comrade Plekha-nov, by distorting private conversations. 
 Comrade Plekha-nov protested, and Comrade Martov was obliged to withdraw his accusations (League Minutes, pp. 
 39 and 134), whichwere a product of either irresponsibility or resentment. 
 The time for the report arrived. 
 I had been the League’s delegate at the Party Congress. 
 A mere reference to thesummary of my report (p. 
 43 et seq. 
) * will show the reader that I gave a rough outline of that analysis of the voting at the Congress which, in greater detail, forms the contentsof the present pamphlet. 
 The central feature of the reportwas precisely the proof that, owing to their mistakes, Martovand Co. 
 had landed in the opportunist wing of our Party. 
Although this report was made to an audience whose majori-ty consisted of violent opponents, they could discover absolutely nothing in it which departed from loyal methodsof Party struggle and controversy. 
 Martov’s report, on the contrary, apart from minor ‘cor-rections’ to particular points of my account (the incorrect-ness of these corrections we have shown above), was nothing but—a product of disordered nerves. 
 No wonder that the majority refused to carry on the fight in this atmosphere. 
 Comrade Plekhanov entered a pro-test against the “ scene ” (p. 
 68)—it was indeed a regular “scene”!—and withdrew from the Congress without statingthe objections he had already prepared on the substance of the report. 
 Nearly all the other supporters of the majority *See pp. 
 73-83 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 also withdrew from the Congress, after filing a written pro-test against the “unworthy behaviour” of Comrade Martov (League Minutes, p. 
 75). 
 The methods of struggle employed by the minority became perfectly clear to all. 
 We had accused the minority of com-mitting a political mistake at the Congress, of having swungtowards opportunism, of having formed a coalition withthe Bundists, the Akimovs, the Brouckères, the Egorovs, and the Makhovs. 
 The minority had been defeated at the Congress and they had now “worked out” two methods of struggle, embracing all their endless variety of sorties, assaults,attacks, etc. 
 First method —disorganising all the activity of the Party, damaging the work, hampering all and everything “with-out statement of reasons”. 
 Second method —making “scenes”, and so on and so forth. 
 * This “second method of struggle” is also apparent in the League’s famous resolutions of “principle”, in the dis-cussion of which the “majority”, of course, took no part. 
Let us examine these resolutions, which Comrade Martov has reproduced in his State of Siege . 
 The first resolution, signed by Comrades Trotsky, Fomin, Deutsch, and others, contains two theses directed againstthe “majority” of the Party Congress: 1) “The League ex-presses its profound regret that, owing to the manifestation atthe Congress of tendencies which essentially run counter to the earlier policy of Iskra , due care was not given in drafting the Party Rules to providing sufficient safeguardsof the independence and authority of the Central Committee. 
”(League Minutes, p. 
 83. 
) As we have already seen, this thesis of “principle” amounts to nothing but Akimov phrase-mongering, the opportunist character of which was exposed at the Party Congress even by Comrade Popov! In point of fact, the claim that the *I have already pointed out that it would be unwise to attribute to sordid motives even the most sordid manifestations of the squab-bling that is so habitual in the atmosphere of émigré and exile colonies. 
 It is a sort of epidemic disease engendered by abnormal conditions of life, disordered nerves, and so on. 
 I had to give a true picture of this system of struggle here, because Comrade Martov has again resorted to it in its full scope in his “ State of Siege”. 
 “majority” did not mean to safeguard the independence and authority of the Central Committee was never anything but gossip. 
 It need only be mentioned that when Plekhanov and I were on the editorial board, there was on the Council no predominance of the Central Organ over the Central Commit-tee, but when the Martovites joined the editorial board,the Central Organ secure d predominance over the Central Committee on the Council! When we were on the editorial board, practical workers in Russia predominated on the Council over writers residing abroad; since the Martovitestook over, the contrary has been the case. 
 When we were onthe editorial board, the Council never once attempted to interfere in any practical matter; since the unanimous co-optation such interference has begun , as the reading public will learn in detail in the near future. 
 Next thesis of the resolution we are examining: “...when constituting the official central bodies of the Party, the Con-gress ignored the need for maintaining continuity withthe actually existing central bodies.... 
” This thesis boils down to nothing but the question of the personal composition of the central bodies. 
 The “minority” preferred to evade the fact that at the Congress the oldcentral bodies had proved their unfitness and committed anumber of mistakes. 
 But most comical of all is the referenceto “continuity” with respect to the Organising Committee. 
At the Congress, as we have seen, nobody even hinted that the entire membership of the Organising Committee should be endorsed. 
 At the Congress, Martov actually cried in afrenzy that a list containing three members of the Organis-ing Committee was defamatory to him. 
 At the Congress,the final list proposed by the “minority” contained one member of the Organising Committee ( Popov , Glebov or Fomin, and Trotsky), whereas the list the “majority” put through contained two members of the Organising Committee out of three ( Travinsky , Vasilyev , and Glebov). 
 We ask, can this reference to “continuity” really be considered a “differ-ence of principle”? Let us pass to the other resolution, which was signed by four members of the old editorial board, headed by Com-rade Axelrod. 
 Here we find all those major accusationsagainst the “majority” which have subsequently been re-peated many times in the press. 
 They can most conveniently be examined as formulated by the members of the editorial circle. 
 The accusations are levelled against “the system of autocratic and bureaucratic government of the Party”,against “bureaucratic centralism”, which, as distinct from“genuinely Social-Democratic centralism”, is defined a~follows: it “places in the forefront, not internal union, butexternal, formal unity, achieved and maintained by purely mechanical means, by the systematic suppression of indi-vidual initiative an independent social activity”; it istherefore “by its very nature incapable of organically unitingthe component elements of society”. 
 What “society” Comrade Axelrod and Co. 
 are here refer-ring to, heaven alone knows. 
 Apparently, Comrade Axelrod was not quite clear himself whether he was penning a Zemstvo address on the subject of desirable governmentreforms, or pouring forth the complaints of the “minority”. 
What is the implication of “autocracy” in the Party, about which the dissatisfied “editors” clamour? Autocracy meansthe supreme, uncontrolled, non-accountable, non-elective rule of one individual. 
 We know very well from the litera-ture of the “minority” that by autocrat they mean me, and no one else. 
 When the resolution in question was beingdrafted and adopted, I was on the Central Organ togetherwith Plekhanov. 
 Consequently, Comrade Axelrod and Co. 
were expressing the conviction that Plekhanov and all the members of the Central Committee “governed the Party”, not in accordance with their own views of what the interestsof the work required, but in accordance with the will of the autocrat Lenin. 
 This accusation of autocratic governmentnecessarily and inevitably implies pronouncing all membersof the governing body except the autocrat to be mere tools in the hands of another, mere pawns and agents of another’s will. 
 And once again we ask, is this really a “difference ofprinciple” on the part of the highly respected ComradeAxelrod? Further, what external, formal unity are they here talking about, our “Party members” just returned from a Party Congress whose decisions they have solemnly acknowledged valid? Do they know of any other method of achieving unityin a party organised on any at all durable basis, except a party Congress? If they do, why have they not the courage to declare frankly that they no longer regard the Second Congress as valid? Why do they not try to tell us their new ideas and new methods of achieving unity in a supposedlyorganised party? Further, what “suppression of individual initiative” are they talking about, our individualist intellectuals whomthe Central Organ of the Party has just been exhorting to set forth their differences, but who instead have engaged in bargaining about “co-optation”? And, in general, how couldPlekhanov and I, or the Central Committee, have suppressedthe initiative and independent activity of people who refusedto engage in any “activity” in conjunction with us? How can anyone be “suppressed” in an institution or body in which he refuses to have any part ? How could the unelected editors complain of a “system of government” when theyrefused to “ be governed ”? We could not have committed any errors in directing our comrades for the simple reason thatthey never worked under our direction at all. 
 It is clear, I think, that the cries about this celebrated bureaucracy are just a screen for dissatisfaction with the personal composition of the central bodies, a fig-leaf to coverup the violation of a pledge solemnly given at the Congress. 
You are a bureaucrat because you were appointed by theCongress not in accordance with my wishes, but againstthem; you are a formalist because you take your stand on the formal decisions of the Congress, and not on my consent; you are acting in a grossly mechanical way because you citethe “mechanical” majority at the Party Congress and payno heed to my wish to be co-opted; you are an autocrat be-cause you refuse to hand over the power to the old snug littleband who insist on their circle “continuity” all the more because they do not like the explicit disapproval of this circle spirit by the Congress. 
 These cries about bureaucracy have never had any real meaning except the one I have indicated. 
 * And this method of struggle only proves once again the intellectualist instabil-ity of the minority. 
 They wanted to convince the Party that *It is enough to point out that Comrade Plekhanov ceased to be a supporter of “bureaucratic centralism” in the eyes of the minorityonce he put through the beneficent co-optation. 
 the selection of the central bodies was unfortunate. 
 And how did they go about it? By criticism of Iskra as conducted by Plekhanov and me? No, that they were unable to offer. 
 The method they used consisted in the refusal of a section of theParty to work under the direction of the hated central bodies. 
But no central institution of any party in the world can everprove its ability to direct people who refuse to accept itsdirection. 
 Refusal to accept the direction of the central bodies is tantamount to refusing to remain in the Party, it is tantamount to disrupting the Party; it is a method ofdestroying , not of convincing. 
 And these efforts to destroy instead of convince show their lack of consistent principles,lack of faith in their own ideas. 
 They talk of bureaucracy. 
 The word bureaucracy might be translated into Russian as concentration on place and position. 
 Bureaucracy means subordinating the interests ofthe work to the interests of one’s own career ; it means focusing attention on places and ignoring the work itself; it means wrangling over co-optation instead of fighting for ideas . 
 That bureaucracy of this kind is undesirable and detrimental to the Party is unquestionably true, and I can safely leave it to the reader to judge which of the two sides now contendingin our Party is guilty of such bureaucracy.... 
 They talkabout grossly mechanical methods of achieving unity. 
Unquestionably, grossly mechanical methods are detrimen-tal; but I again leave it to the reader to judge whether a grosser and more mechanical method of struggle of a new trend against an old one can be imagined than installingpeople in Party institutions before the Party has been con-vinced of the correctness of their new views, and before theseviews have even been set forth to the Party. 
 But perhaps the catchwords of the minority do mean something in principle, perhaps they do express some special group of ideas, irrespective of the petty and particular causewhich undoubtedly started the “swing” in the present case?Perhaps if we were to set aside the wrangling over “co-opta-tion”, these catchwords might turn out to be an expressionof a different system of views? Let us examine the matter from this angle. 
 Before doing so, we must place on record that the first to attempt suchan examination was Comrade Plekhanov at the League, who pointed out the minority’s swing towards anarchism and opportunism , and that Comrade Martov (who is now high-ly offended because not everyone is ready to admit that his position is one of principle *) preferred completely to ignore this incident in his State of Siege. 
 At the League Congress the general question was raised as to whether Rules that the League or a committee maydraw up for itself are valid without the Central Committee’s endorsement, and even if the Central Committee refuses to endorse them. 
 Nothing could be clearer, one would think:Rules are a formal expression of organisation, and, accord-ing to Paragraph 6 of our Party Rules, the right to organisecommittees is explicitly vested in the Central Committee;Rules define the limits of a committee’s autonomy, and the decisive voice in defining those limits belongs to the central and not to a local institution of the Party. 
 That is elementary , and it was sheer childishness to argue with such an air of profundity that “organising” does not alwaysimply “endorsing Rules” (as if the League itself had notof its own accord expressed the wish to be organised on the basis of formal Rules). 
 But Comrade Martov has forgotten (temporarily, let us hope) even the ABC of Social-Democracy. 
In his opinion, the demand that Rules should be endorsedonly indicated that “the earlier, revolutionary Iskra cen-tralism is being replaced by bureaucratic centralism”(League Minutes, p. 
 95), and there, in fact—Comrade Martov declared in the same speech—lay the “principle” at issue *Nothing could be more comical than the new Iskra ’s grievance that Lenin refuses to see any differences of principle, or denies them. 
 If your attitude had been based more on principle, you would the soon-er have examined my repeated statements that you have swung to-wards opportunism. 
 If your position had been based more on prin-ciple, you could not well have degraded an ideological struggle to asquabble over places. 
 You have only yourselves to blame, for you have yourselves done everything to make it impossible to regard you as men of principle. 
 Take Comrade Martov, for example: when speaking,in his State of Siege , of the League Congress, he says nothing about the dispute with Plekhanov over anarchism, but instead informs usthat Lenin is a super-centre, that Lenin has only to wink his eye tohave the centre issue orders, that the Central Committee rode rough-shod over the League, etc. 
 I have no doubt that by picking his topic in this way, Comrade Martov displayed the profundity of his ideals andprinciples. 
 (p. 
 96)—a principle which he preferred to ignore in his State of Siege! Comrade Plekhanov answered Martov at once, requesting that expressions like bureaucracy, Jack-in-office, etc. 
, berefrained from as “detracting from the dignity of the Con-gress” (p. 
 96). 
 There followed an interchange with ComradeMartov, who regarded these expressions as “a characterisa-tion of a certain trend from the standpoint of principle”. 
 At that time , Comrade Plekhanov, like all the other supporters of the majority, took these expressions at their real value,clearly realising that they related exclusively to the realm,if we may so put it, of “co-optation”, and not of principle. 
However, he deferred to the insistence of the Martovs andDeutsches (pp. 
 96-97) and proceeded to examine their supposed principles from the standpoint of principle . 
 “If that were so,” said he (that is, if the committees were autonomousin shaping their organisation, in drawing up their Rules),“they would be autonomous in relation to the whole, to theParty. 
 That is not even a Bundist view, it is a downrightanarchistic view. 
 That is just how the anarchists argue: the rights of individuals are unlimited; they may conflict; every individual determines the limits of his rights forhimself. 
 The limits of autonomy should be determined notby the group itself, but by the whole of which it forms a part. 
The Bund was a striking instance of the violation of thisprinciple. 
 Hence, the limits of autonomy are determined by the Congress, or by the highest body set up by the Congress. 
 The authority of the central institution should rest on moraland intellectual prestige. 
 There I, of course, agree. 
 Everyrepresentative of the organisation must be concerned for themoral prestige of its institution. 
 But it does not follow that,while prestige is necessary, authority is not.... 
 To counter-oppose the power of authority to the power of ideas is anar-chistic talk, which should have no place here” (p. 
 98). 
 Thesepropositions are as elementary as can be, they are in factaxioms, which it was strange even to put to the vote (p. 
 102)and which were called in question only because “conceptshave now been confused” (loc. 
 cit). 
 But the minority’s intellectualist individualism had, inevitably, driven themto the point of wanting to sabotage the Congress, to refuseto submit to the majority; and that wish could not be justi-fied except by anarchistic talk . 
 It is very amusing to note that the minority had nothing to offer in reply to Plekhanov but complaints of his use of excessively strong words, like opportunism, anarchism, and so forth. 
 Plekhanov quiterightly poked fun at these complaints by asking why “thewords Jaurèsism and anarchism are not permissible, andthe words lèse-majesté and Jack-in-office are”. 
 No answer was given. 
 This quaint sort of quid pro quo is always happening to Comrades Martov, Axelrod, and Co. 
: their new catchwords clearly bear the stamp of vexation; any reference to the factoffends them—they are, you see, men of principle; but, theyare told, if you deny on principle that the part should submit to the whole, you are anarchists, and again they are offend-ed!—the expression is too strong! In other words, they want to give battle to Plekhanov, but only on condition that he does not hit back in earnest! How many times Comrade Martov and various other “Mensheviks” * have convicted me, no less childishly, of the following “contradiction”. 
 They quote a passage from What Is To Be Done? or A Letter to a Comrade which speaks of ideo-logical influence, a struggle for influence, etc. 
, and contrast it to the “bureaucratic” method of influencing by means ofthe Rules, to the “autocratic” tendency to rely on authority,and the like. 
 How naïve they are! They have already for-gotten that previously our Party was not a formally organised whole, but merely a sum of separate groups, and therefore no other relations except those of ideological influence were possible between these groups. 
 Now we have become an organised Party, and this implies the establishment ofauthority, the transformation of the power of ideas into thepower of authority, the subordination of lower Party bodiesto higher ones. 
 Why, it positively makes one uncomfortable to have to chew over such elementary things for the benefit of old associates, especially when one feels that at the bottomof it all is simply the minority’s refusal to submit to themajority in the matter of the elections! But from the stand-point of principle these endless exposures of my contradictions boil down to nothing but anarchistic phrase-mongering.

 /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR new Iskra is not averse to enjoying the title and rights of a Party institution, but it does not want to submit to the majority of the Party. 
 If the talk about bureaucracy contains any principle at all, if it is not just an anarchistic denial of the dutyof the part to submit to the whole, then what we have hereis the principle of opportunism , which seeks to lessen the responsibility of individual intellectuals to the party of the proletariat, to lessen the influence of the central insti-tutions, to enlarge the autonomy of the least steadfast ele-ments in the Party, to reduce organisational relations toa purely platonic and verbal acceptance of them. 
 We sawthis at the Party Congress, where the Akimovs and Liebersmade exactly the same sort of speeches about “monstrous” centralism as poured from the lips of Martov and Co. 
 at the League Congress. 
 That opportunism leads to the Martovand Axelrod “views” on organisation by its very nature,and not by chance, and not in Russia alone but the worldover, we shall see later, when examining Comrade Axelrod’sarticle in the new Iskra . 
 P. 
 LITTLE ANNOYANCES SHOULD NOT STAND IN THE WAY OF A BIG PLEASURE The League’s rejection of the resolution declaring that its Rules must be endorsed by the Central Committee (League Minutes, p. 
 105) was, as the Party Congress majori-ty at once unanimously noted, a “ crying violation of the Party Rules ”. 
 Regarded as the act of men of principle, this violation was sheer anarchism; while in the atmosphere ofthe post-Congress struggle, it inevitably created the impres-sion that the Party minority were trying to “settle scores” with the Party majority (League Minutes, p. 
 112); it meant that they did not wish to obey the Party or to remain withinthe Party. 
 And when the League refused to adopt a resolutionon the Central Committee statement calling for changes inits Rules (pp. 
 124-25), it inevitably followed that thisassembly, which wanted to be counted an assembly of a Party organisation but at the same time not to obey the Party’s central institution, had to be pronounced unlawful . 
 Accordingly, the followers of the Party majority at once withdrew from this quasi-Party assembly, so as not to have any share in an indecent farce. 
 The individualism of the intellectual, with its platonic acceptance of organisational relations, which was revealedin the lack of steadfastness over Paragraph 1 of the Rules,thus in practice reached the logical end I had predictedeven in September, that is, a month and a half before, name-ly, the point of disrupting the Party organisation. 
 And at that moment, on the evening of the day the League Congress ended, Comrade Plekhanov announced to his colleagues onboth the Party’s central institutions that he could not bearto “fire on his comrades”, that “rather than have a split,it is better to put a bullet in one’s brain”, and that, to averta greater evil, it was necessary to make the maximum person-al concessions, over which, in point of fact (much more than over the principles to be discerned-in the incorrectposition on Paragraph 1), this destructive struggle was beingwaged. 
 In order to give a more accurate characterisation ofComrade Plekhanov’s right-about-face, which has acquireda certain general Party significance, I consider it advisable to rely not on private conversations, nor on private letters (that last resort in extremity), but on Plekhanov’s ownstatement of the case to the whole Party, namely, his article“What Should Not Be Done” in No. 
 52 of Iskra , which was written just after the League Congress, after I had resignedfrom the editorial board of the Central Organ (November 1, 1903), and before the co-optation of the Martovites (Novem-ber 26, 1903). 
 The fundamental idea of “What Should Not Be Done” is that in politics one must not be too stiff-necked, too harshand unyielding; that it is sometimes necessary, to avoida split, to yield even to revisionists (among those moving towards us or among the inconsistents) and to anarchistic individualists. 
 It was only natural that these abstract gener-alities should arouse universal perplexity among Iskra read-ers. 
 One cannot help laughing when reading the proud andmajestic statements of Comrade Plekhanov (in subsequentarticles) that he had not been understood because of the novelty of his ideas and because people lacked a knowledge of dialectics. 
 In reality, “What Should Not Be Done” couldonly be understood, at the time it was written, by some dozen people living in two Geneva suburbs whose names both begin with the same letter. 
110 Comrade Plekhanov’s misfor-tune was that he put into circulation among some ten thousand readers an agglomeration of hints, reproaches,algebraical symbols, and riddles which were intended onlyfor these dozen or so people who had taken part in all thedevelopments of the post-Congress struggle with the minor-ity. 
 This misfortune befell Comrade Plekhanov because he violated a basic principle of that dialectics to which he so unluckily referred, namely, that there is no abstract truth,that truth is always concrete. 
 That is why it was out ofplace to lend an abstract form to the perfectly concreteidea of yielding to the Martovites after the League Congress. 
 Yielding—which Comrade Plekhanov advocated as a new war-cry—is legitimate and essential in two cases: when the yielder is convinced that those who are striving to makehim yield are in the right (in which case honest politicalleaders frankly and openly admit their mistake), or whenan irrational and harmful demand is yielded to in orderto avert a greater evil. 
 It is perfectly clear from the article in question that it is the latter case the author has in mind: he speaks plainly of yielding to revisionists and anarchisticindividualists (that is, to the Martovites, as every Partymember now knows from the League Minutes), and says thatit is essential in order to avert a split. 
 As we see, ComradePlekhanov’s supposedly novel idea amounts to no more than the not very novel piece of commonplace wisdom that little annoyances should not be allowed to stand in the wayof a big pleasure, that a little opportunist folly and a littleanarchistic talk is better than a big Party split. 
 When Com-rade Plekhanov wrote this article he clearly realised thatthe minority represented the opportunist wing of our Party and that they were fighting with anarchistic weapons. 
 Comrade Plekhanov came forward with the plan to combatthis minority by means of personal concessions, just as(again si licet parva componere magnis ) the German Social-Democrats combated Bernstein. 
 Bebel publicly declared atcongresses of his Party that he did not know anyone who was so susceptible to the influence of environment as Comrade Bernstein (not Mr. 
 Bernstein, as Comrade Plekhanov wasonce so fond of calling him, but Comrade Bernstein): let us take him into our environment, let us make him a member of the Reichstag, let us combat revisionism, not by inappro-priate harshness ( à la Sobakevich-Parvus) towards the revi-sionist, but by “killing him with kindness”—as ComradeM. 
 Beer, I recall, put it at a meeting of English Social-Democrats when defending German conciliatoriness, peace-ableness, mildness, flexibility, and caution against theattack of the English Sobakevich—Hyndman. 
 And in just the same way, Comrade Plekhanov wanted to “kill with kindness” the little anarchism and the little opportunismof Comrades Axelrod and Martov. 
 True, while hinting quiteplainly at the “anarchistic individualists”, Comrade Plekha-nov expressed himself in a deliberately vague way aboutthe revisionists; he did so in a manner to create the impression that he was referring to the Rabocheye Dyelo -ists, who were swinging from opportunism towards orthodoxy, and notto Axelrod and Martov, who had begun to swing from ortho-doxy towards revisionism . 
 But this was only an innocent mili-tary ruse, * a feeble bulwark that was incapable of with-standing the artillery fire of Party publicity. 
 And anyone who acquaints himself with the actual state of affairs at the political juncture we are describing, anyonewho gains an insight into Comrade Plekhanov’s mentality,will realise that I could not have acted in this instanceotherwise than I did. 
 I say this for the benefit of those support-ers of the majority who have reproached me for surrendering *There was never any question after the Party Congress of making concessions to Comrades Martynov, Akimov, and Brouckère. 
 I am not aware that they too demanded “co-optation”. 
 I even doubt whetherComrade Starover or Comrade Martov consulted Comrade Brouckèrewhen they sent us their epistles and “notes” in the name of “half theParty”.... 
 At the League Congress Comrade Martov rejected, with theprofound indignation of an unbending political stalwart, the very idea of a “union with Ryazanov or Martynov”, of the possibility of a “deal” with them, or even of joint “service to the Party” (as an editor;League Minutes, D. 
 53). 
 At the League Congress Comrade Martovsternly condemned “Martynov tendencies” (p. 
 88), and when Com-rade Orthodox 111 subtly hinted that Axelrod and Martov no doubt “consider that Comrades Akimov, Martynov, and others also have the right to get together, draw up Rules for themselves, and act in accordance with them as they see fit” (p. 
 99), the Martovites deniedit, as Peter denied Christ (p. 
 100: “Comrade Orthodox’s fears” “re-garding the Akimovs, Martynovs, etc. 
”, “have no foundation”). 
 the editorial board. 
 When Comrade Plekhanov swung round after the League Congress and from being a supporter of the majority became a supporter of reconciliation at all costs, I was obliged to put the very best interpretation on it. 
Perhaps Comrade Plekhanov wanted in his article to putforward a programme for an amicable and honest peace?Any such programme boils down to a sincere admissionof mistakes by both sides. 
 What was the mistake Comrade Plekhanov laid at the door of the majority? An inappro-priate, Sobakevich-like, harshness towards the revisionists. 
We do not know what Comrade Plekhanov had in mind bythat: his witticism about the asses, or his extremely incau-tious—in Axelrod’s presence—reference to anarchism andopportunism. 
 Comrade Plekhanov preferred to express him-self “abstractly”, and, moreover, with a hint at the other fellow. 
 That is a matter of taste, of course. 
 But, after all,I had admitted my personal harshness openly both in theletter to the Iskra -ist and at the League Congress. 
 How then could I refuse to admit that the majority were guilty of sucha “mistake”? As to the minority, Comrade Plekhanov pointed to their mistake quite clearly, namely, revisionism (cf. 
 his remarks about opportunism at the Party Congress and aboutJaurèsism at the League Congress) and anarchism which hadled to the verge of a split. 
 Could I obstruct an attempt tosecure an acknowledgement of these mistakes and undo theirharm by means of personal concessions and “kindness” in general? Could I obstruct such an attempt when Comrade Plekhanov in “What Should Not Be Done” directly appealedto us to “ spare the adversaries ” among the revisionists who were revisionists “only because of a certain inconsistency”?And if I did not believe in this attempt, could I do otherwisethan make a personal concession regarding the Central Organ and move over to the Central Committee in order to defend the position of the majority? * I could not absolutely deny *Comrade Martov put it very aptly when he said that I had moved over avec armes et bagages . 
 Comrade Martov is very fond of military metaphors: campaign against the League, engagement, incurablewounds, etc. 
, etc. 
 To tell the truth, I too have a great weakness for mili-tary metaphors, especially just now, when one follows the news from the Pacific with such eager interest. 
 But, Comrade Martov, if we areto use military language, the story goes like this. 
 We capture twoforts at the Party Congress. 
 You attack them at the League Congress. 
 the feasibility of such attempts and take upon myself the full onus for the threatening split, if only because I had myself been inclined, in the letter of October 6, to attribute the wrangle to “personal irritation”. 
 But I did consider, andstill consider, it my political duty to defend the position ofthe majority. 
 To rely in this on Comrade Plekhanov wouldhave been difficult and risky, for everything went to showthat he was prepared to interpret his dictum that “a leader of the proletariat has no right to give rein to his warlike inclinations when they run counter to political good sense”—to interpret it in a dialectical way to mean that if youhad to fire, then it was better sense (considering the state ofthe weather in Geneva in November) to fire at the majority.... 
To defend the majority’s position was essential, because, when dealing with the question of the free (?) will of a revo-lutionary, Comrade Plekhanov—in defiance of dialectics,which demands a concrete and comprehensive examination—modestly evaded the question of confidence in a revolutionary , of confidence in a “leader of the proletariat” who was leadinga definite wing of the Party. 
 When speaking of anarchistic individualism and advising us to close our eyes “at times” to violations of discipline and to yield “sometimes” to intel-lectualist license, which “is rooted in a sentiment that hasnothing to do with devotion to the revolutionary idea”,Comrade Plekhanov apparently forgot that we must alsoreckon with the free will of the majority of the Party, and that it must be left to the practical workers to determine the extent of the concessions to be made to the anarchistic indi-vidualists. 
 Easy as it is to fight childish anarchistic nonsenseon the literary plane, it is very difficult to carry on practicalwork in the same organisation with an anarchistic individ-ualist. 
 A writer who took it upon himself to determine the extent of the concessions that might be made to anarchism After the first brief interchange of shots, my colleague, the commandant of one of the forts, opens the gates to the enemy. 
 Naturally, I gathertogether the little artillery I have and move into the other fort, whichis practically unfortified, in order to “stand siege” against the enemy’soverwhelming numbers. 
 I even make an offer of peace, for what chance do I stand against two powers? But in reply to my offer, the new allies bombard my last fort. 
 I return the fire. 
 Whereupon my former col-league—the commandant—exclaims in magnificent indignation: “Justlook, good people, how bellicose this Chamberlain is!” in practice would only be betraying his inordinate and truly doctrinaire literary conceit. 
 Comrade Plekhanov majestically remarked (for the sake of importance, as Bazarov112 used to say) that if a new split were to occur the workers wouldcease to understand us; yet at the same time he initiatedan endless stream of articles in the new Iskra whose real and concrete meaning was bound to be incomprehensiblenot only to the workers, but to the world at large. 
 It is not surprising that when a member of the Central Committee read the proofs of “What Should Not Be Done” he warnedComrade Plekhanov that his plan to somewhat curtail thesize of a certain publication (the minutes of the Party Con-gress and the League Congress) would be defeated by thisvery article, which would excite curiosity, offer for the judge-ment of the man in the street something that was piquant and at the same time quite incomprehensible to him, * and inevitably cause people to ask in perplexity: “What has hap-pened?” It is not surprising that owing to the abstractnessof its arguments and the vagueness of its hints, this articleof Comrade Plekhanov’s caused jubilation in the ranks of the enemies of Social-Democracy—the dancing of the cancan in the columns of Revolutsionnaya Rossiya and ecstatic praises from the consistent revisionists in Osvobozhdeniye . 
 The source of all these comical and sad misunderstandings,from which Comrade Plekhanov later tried so comically andso sadly to extricate himself, lay precisely in the violation of that basic principle of dialectics: concrete questions should be examined in all their concreteness. 
 The delight of Mr. 
Struve, in particular, was quite natural: he was not in theleast interested in the “good” aims (killing with kindness) *We are having a heated and passionate argument in private. 
 Suddenly one of us jumps up, flings open the window, and begins toclamour against Sobakeviches, anarchistic individualists, revisionists,etc. 
 Naturally, a crowd of curious idlers gathers in the street and ourenemies rub their hands in glee. 
 Other of the disputants go to the win-dow too and want to give a coherent account of the whole matter,without hinting at things nobody knows anything about. 
 Thereuponthe window is banged to on the plea that it is not worth while discus-sing squabbles (Iskra , No. 
 53, p. 
 8, col. 
 2, line 24 up). 
 It was not worth while beginning in “Iskra ” on a discussion of “squabbles”, Comrade Plekhanov 113—that would be nearer the truth! which Comrade Plekhanov pursued (but might not achieve); Mr. 
 Struve welcomed, and could not but welcome, that swing towards the opportunist wing of our Party which had begun in the new Iskra , as everybody can now plainly see. 
 The Russian bourgeois democrats are not the only onesto welcome every swing-towards opportunism, even theslightest and most temporary, in any Social-Democraticparty. 
 The estimate of a shrewd enemy is very rarely based on sheer misunderstanding: you can tell a man’s mistakes by the people who praise him. 
 And it is in vain that ComradePlekhanov hopes the reader will be inattentive and triesto make out that the majority unconditionally objectedto a personal concession in the matter of co-optation, andnot to a desertion from the Left wing of the Party to the Right. 
 The point is not that Comrade Plekhanov made a personal concession in order to avert a split (that was verypraiseworthy), but that, though fully realising the needto join issue with the inconsistent revisionists and anarchistic individualists, he chose instead to join issue with the major-ity, with whom he parted company over the extent of the possible practical concessions to anarchism. 
 The point is not that Comrade Plekhanov changed the personal compo-sition of the editorial board, but that he betrayed his positionof opposing revisionism and anarchism and ceased to defendthat position in the Central Organ of the Party. 
 As to the Central Committee, which at this time was the sole organised representative of the majority, Comrade Plekhanov parted company with it then exclusively over the possible extent of practical concessions to anarchism . 
 Nearly a month had elapsed since November 1, when my resig-nation had given a free hand to the policy of killing withkindness. 
 Comrade Plekhanov had had every opportunity,through all sorts of contacts, to test the expedience ofthis policy. 
 Comrade Plekhanov had in this period publishedhis article “What Should Not Be Done”, which was— and remains —the Martovites’ sole ticket of admittance, so to speak, to the editorial board. 
 The watchwords—revisionism(which we should contend with, but sparing the adversary)and anarchistic individualism (which should be courted andkilled with kindness)—were printed on this ticket in impos-ing italics. 
 Do come in, gentlemen, please, I will kill you with kindness—is what Comrade Plekhanov said by this invitation card to his new colleagues on the editorial board. 
 Naturally, all that remained to the Central Committee was to say its last word (that is what ultimatum means—a last word as to a possible peace) about what, in its opinion,was the permissible extent of practical concessions to anar-chistic individualism. 
 Either you want peace—in whichcase here are a certain number of seats to prove our kindness, peaceableness, readiness to make concessions, etc. 
 (we cannot allow you any more if peace is to be guaranteed in the Party,peace not in the sense of an absence of controversy, but inthe sense that the Party will not be destroyed by anarchisticindividualism); take these seats and swing back again littleby little from Akimov to Plekhanov. 
 Or else you want to maintain and develop your point of view, to swing over altogether to Akimov (if only in the realm of organisationalquestions), and to convince the Party that you, not Plekha-nov, are right—in which case form a writers’ group of yourown, secure representation at the next Congress, and setabout winning a majority by an honest struggle, by open controversy. 
 This alternative, which was quite explicitly submitted to the Martovites in the Central Committee ulti-matum of November 25, 1903 (see State of Siege and Com-mentary on the League Minutes *), was in full harmony with *I shall not, of course, go into the tangle Martov created over this Central Committee ultimatum in his State of Siege by quoting privateconversations and so on. 
 This is the “second method of struggle” I de-scribed in the previous section, which only a specialist in nervous disor-ders could hope to disentangle. 
 It is enough to say that Comrade Martovinsists that there was an agreement with the Central Committee notto publish the negotiations, which agreement has not been discoveredto this day in spite of a most assiduous search. 
 Comrade Travinskywho conducted the negotiations on behalf of the Central Committee,informed me in writing that he considered me entitled to publish myletter to the editors outside of Iskra . 
 But there was one phrase of Comrade Martov’s that I particularly liked. 
 That was the phrase “Bonapartism of the worst type. 
” I findthat Comrade Martov has brought in this category very appropriately. 
Let us examine dispassionately what the concept implies. 
, In ‘myopinion, it implies acquiring power by formally legal means, but actually in defiance of the will of the people (or of a party). 
’ Is that not so, Comrade Martov? And if it is then I may safely leave it tothe public to judge who has been guilty of this “Bonapartism of the the letter Plekhanov and I had sent to the former editors on October 6, 1903: either it is a matter of personal irritation (in which case, if the worst comes to the worst , we might even “co-opt”), or it is a matter of a difference of principle (inwhich case you must first convince the Party, and only then talk about changing the personal composition of the centralbodies). 
 The Central Committee could the more readilyleave it to the Martovites to make this delicate choice for themselves since at this very time Comrade Martov in his profession de foi (Once More in the Minority ) wrote the follow-ing: “The minority lay claim to only one honour , namely, to be the first in the history of our Party to show that one can be‘defeated’ and yet not form a new party . 
 This position of the minority follows from all their views on the organisational development of the Party; it follows from the consciousnessof their strong ties with the Party’s earlier work. 
 The minor-ity do not believe in the mystic power of ‘paper revolutions’,and see in the deep roots which their endeavours have in life a guarantee that by purely ideological propaganda within the Party they will secure the triumph of their principles of organisation . 
” (My italics. 
) What proud and magnificent words! And how bitter it was to be taught by events that’ they were— merely words .... 
 I hope you will forgive me, Comrade Martov, but now I claim on behalf of the majority this “honour” which you have not deserved . 
 The honour will indeed be a great one, one worth fighting for, for the circles have left us the tradition ofan extraordinarily light-hearted attitude towards splitsand an extraordinarily zealous application of the maxim:“either coats off, or let’s have your hand!” The big pleasure (of having a united Party) was bound to outweigh, and did outweigh, the little annoyances (in worst type” Lenin and Comrade Y,114 who might have availed them-selves of their formal right not to admit the Martovites, but did not avail themselves of it, though in doing so they would have been backed by the will of the Second Congress—or those who occupied the editor-ial board by formally legitimate means (“unanimous co-optation”), but who knew that actually this was not in accordance with the will of the Second Congress and who are afraid to have this will tested at the Third Congress. 
 the shape of the squabbling over co-optation). 
 I resigned from the Central Organ, and Comrade Y (who had been dele-gated by Plekhanov and myself to the Party Council on behalf of the editorial board of the Central Organ) resignedfrom the Council. 
 The Martovites replied to the Central Com-mittee’s last word as to peace with a letter (see publicationsmentioned) which was tantamount to a declaration of war. 
Then, and only then, did I write my letter to the editorial board ( Iskra , No. 
 53) on the subject of publicity. 
 * If it comes to talking about revisionism and discussing inconsis-tency, anarchistic individualism, and the defeat of variousleaders, then, gentlemen, let us tell all that occurred, with-out reservation—that was the gist of this letter aboutpublicity. 
 The editorial board replied with angry abuse and the lordly admonition: do not dare to stir up “ the pet-tiness and squabbling of circle life ” (Iskra , No. 
 53). 
 Is that so, I thought to myself: “the pettiness and squabbling ofcircle life ”?... Well, es ist mir recht , gentlemen, there I agree with you. 
 Why, that means that you directly classall this fuss over “co-optation” as circle squabbling . 
 That is true. 
 But what discord is this?—in the editorial of this same issue, No. 
 53, this same editorial board (we must sup-pose) talks about bureaucracy, formalism, and the rest. 
 ** Do not dare to raise the question of the fight for co-optationto the Central Organ, for that would be squabbling. 
 Butwe will raise the question of co-optation to the Central Committee, and will not call it squabbling, but a difference of principle on the subject of “formalism”. 
 No, dear comrades,I said to myself, permit me not to permit you that. 
 Youwant to fire at my fort, and yet demand that I surrendermy artillery. 
 What jokers you are! And so I wrote and pub-lished outside of Iskra my Letter to the Editors (Why I Re-signed from the “Iskra ” Editorial Board ), *** briefly relating what had really occurred, and asking yet again whether *See pp. 
 114-17 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 **As it subsequently turned out, the “discord” was explained very simply—it was a discord among the editors of the Central Organ. 
It was Plekhanov who wrote about “squabbling” (see his admission in“A Sad Misunderstanding”, No. 
 57), while the editorial, “Our Con-gress”, was written by Martov ( State of Siege , p. 
 84). 
 They were tug-ging in different directions.

 peace was not possible on the basis of the following division: you take the Central Organ, we take the Central Committee. 
 Neither side will then feel “alien” in the Party, and we will argue about the swing towards opportunism, first in thepress, and then, perhaps, at the Third Party Congress. 
 In reply to this mention of peace the enemy opened fire with all his-batteries, including even the Council. 
 ShelIsrained on my head. 
 Autocrat, Schweitzer, 115 bureaucrat, formalist, supercentre, one-sided, stiff-necked, obstinate, narrow-minded, suspicious, quarrelsome.... 
 Very well, myfriends! Have you finished? You have nothing more inreserve? Poor ammunition, I must say.... 
 Now comes my turn. 
 Let us examine the content of the new Iskra ’s new views on organisation and the relation of these views to that division of our Party into “majority” and “minority” the true character of which we have shownby our analysis of the debates and voting at the SecondCongress. 
 Q. 
 THE NEW ISKRA . 
 OPPORTUNISM IN QUESTIONS OF ORGANISATION As the basis for an analysis of the principles of the new Iskra we should unquestionably take the two articles of Comrade Axelrod. 
 * The concrete meaning of some of his favourite catchwords has already been shown at length. 
 Now we must try to leave their concrete meaning on one side and delve down to the line of thought that caused the “minor-ity” to arrive (in connection with this or that minor andpetty matter) at these particular slogans rather than anyothers, must examine the principles behind these slogans,irrespective of their origin, irrespective of the question of “co-optation”. 
 Concessions are all the fashion nowadays, so let us make a concession to Comrade Axelrod and take his“theory” “seriously”. 
 Comrade Axelrod’s basic thesis ( Iskra , No. 
 57) is that “from the very outset our movement harboured two oppositetrends, whose mutual antagonism could not fail to develop *These articles were included in the collection “ Iskra ” over Two Years , Part II, p. 
 122 et seq. 
 (St. 
 Petersburg, 1906). 
 (Author’s note to 1907 edition. 
— Ed. 
) and to affect the movement parallel with its own develop-ment”. 
 To be specific: “In principle, the proletarian aim of the movement [in Russia] is the same as that of west-ern Social-Democracy. 
” But in our country the massesof the workers are influenced “by a social element alien tothem”, namely, the radical intelligentsia. 
 And so, ComradeAxelrod establishes the existence of an antagonism betweenthe proletarian and the radical-intellectual trend in our Party. 
 In this Comrade Axelrod is undoubtedly right. 
 The existence of such an antagonism (and not in the RussianSocial-Democratic Party alone) is beyond question. 
 What ismore, everyone knows that it is this antagonism that largelyaccounts for the division of present-day Social-Democracy into revolutionary (also known as orthodox) and opportunist (revisionist, ministerialist, reformist) Social-Democracy,which during the past ten years of our movement has becomefully apparent in Russia too. 
 Everyone also knows thatthe proletarian trend of the movement is expressed by or-thodox Social-Democracy, while the trend of the democratic intelligentsia is expressed by opportunist Social-Democracy. 
 But, after so closely approaching this piece of common knowledge, Comrade Axelrod begins timidly to back awayfrom it. 
 He does not make the slightest attempt to analyse how this division manifested itself in the history of Rus-sian Social-Democracy in general, and at our Party Con-gress in particular, although it is about the Congress that he is writing! Like all the other editors of the new Iskra , Comrade Axelrod displays a mortal fear of the minutes of this Congress. 
 This should not surprise us after all thathas been said above, but in a “theoretician” who claims tobe investigating the different trends in our movement it is certainly a queer case of truth-phobia . 
 Backing away, because of this malady, from the latest and most accuratematerial on the trends in our movement, Comrade Axelrodseeks salvation in the sphere of pleasant daydreaming. 
 Hewrites: “Has not legal Marxism, or semi-Marxism, providedour liberals with a literary leader? Why should not prank-ish history provide revolutionary bourgeois democracy with a leader from the school of orthodox, revolutionary Marxism?”All we can say about this daydream which Comrade Axelrod finds so pleasant is that if history does sometimes play pranks, that is no excuse for pranks of thought on the part of people who undertake to analyse history. 
 When the liberal peeped out from under the cloak of the leader of semi-Marx-ism, those who wished ( and were able ) to trace his “trend” did not allude to possible pranks of history, but pointedto tens and hundreds of instances of that leader’s mentalityand logic, to alI those characteristics of his literary make-up which betrayed the reflection of Marxism in bourgeois literature. 
 116 And if Comrade Axelrod, setting out to analyse “the general-revolutionary and the proletarian trend in ourmovement”, could produce nothing , absolutely nothing , in proof or evidence that certain representatives of that ortho-dox wing of the Party which he so detests showed such and such a trend, he thereby issued a formal certificate of his own poverty . 
 Comrade Axelrod’s case must be weak indeed if all he can do is allude to possible pranks of history! Comrade Axelrod’s other allusion—to the “Jacobins”— is still more revealing. 
 Comrade Axelrod is probably awarethat the division of present-day Social-Democracy into rev-olutionary and opportunist has long since given rise—and not only in Russia—to “historical parallels with the eraof the great French Revolution”. 
 Comrade Axelrod isprobably aware that the Girondists of present-day Social-Democracy everywhere and always resort to the terms “Jaco-binism”, “Blanquism”, and so on to describe their opponents. 
 Let us then not imitate Comrade Axelrod’s truth-phobia, let us consult the minutes of our Congress and see whetherthey offer any material for an analysis and examinationof the trends we are considering and the parallels we arediscussing. 
 First example: the Party Congress debate on the pro-gramme. 
 Comrade Akimov (“fully agreeing” with Comrade Martynov) says: “The clause on the capture of political power[the dictatorship of the proletariat] has been formulatedin such a way—as compared with the programmes of allother Social-Democratic parties—that it may be interpreted,and actually has been interpreted by Plekhanov, to mean that the role of the leading organisation will relegate to-the background the class it is leading and separate the formerfrom the latter. 
 Consequently, the formulation of our polit-ical tasks is exactly the same as in the case of Narodnaya Volya. 
” (Minutes, p. 
 124. 
) Comrade Plekhanov and other Iskra -ists take issue with Comrade Akimov and accuse him of opportunism. 
 Does not Comrade Axelrod find that this dispute shows us (in actual fact, and not-in the imag-inary pranks of history) the antagonism between the present-day Jacobins and the present-day Girondists of Social-Democ-racy? And was it not because he found himself in the com-pany of the Girondists of Social-Democracy (owing to the mistakes he committed) that Comrade Axelrod began talking about Jacobins? Second example: Comrade Posadovsky declares that there is a “serious difference of opinion” over the “fundamental question” of “the absolute value of democratic principles” (p. 
 169). 
 Together with Plekhanov, he denies their absolutevalue. 
 The leaders of the “Centre” or Marsh (Egorov) and of the anti-Iskra -ists (Goldblatt) vehemently oppose this view and accuse Plekhanov of “imitating bourgeois tactics”(p. 
 170). 
 This is exactly Comrade Axelrod ’s idea of a connection between orthodoxy and the bourgeois trend , the only difference being that in Axelrod’s case it is vague and general, whereasGoldblatt linked it up with specific issues. 
 Again we ask: does not Comrade Axelrod find that this dispute, too, shows us palpably , at our Party Congress, the antagonism between the Jacobins and the Girondists of present-day Social-Democracy? Is it not because he finds himself in the company of the Girondists that Comrade Axelrod raises this outcryagainst the Jacobins? Third example: the debate on Paragraph 1 of the Rules. 
 Who is it that defends “ the proletarian trend in our move-ment ”? Who is it that insists that the worker is not afraid of organisation, that the proletarian has no sympathy for anarchy, that he values the incentive to organise? Who is itthat warns us against the bourgeois intelligentsia, permeated through and through with opportunism? The Jacobins of Social-Democracy . 
 And who is it that tries to smuggle radical intellectuals in the Party? Who is it that is concerned about professors, high-school students, free lances, the radical youth? The Girondist Axelrod together with the Girondist Lieber . 
 How clumsily Comrade Axelrod defends himself against the “false accusation of opportunism” that at our Party Congress was openly levelled at the majority of the Eman-cipation of Labour group! By taking up the hackneyed Bern-steinian refrain about Jacobinism, Blanquism, and so on, he defends himself in a manner that only bears out the accusa-tion! He shouts about the menace of the radical intellec-tuals in order to drown out his own speeches at the Party Congress, which were full of concern for these intellectuals. 
 These “dreadful words”—Jacobinism and the rest—are expressive of opportunism and nothing else. 
 A Jacobin who wholly identities himself with the organisation of the pro-letariat—a proletariat conscious of its class interests— is a revolutionary Social-Democrat . 
 A Girondist who sighs after professors and high-school students, who is afraidof the dictatorship of the proletariat, and who yearns for the absolute value of democratic demands is an opportunist . 
 It is only opportunists who can still detect a danger inconspiratorial organisations today, when the idea of confin-ing the political struggle to conspiracy has been refuted thousands of times in the press and has long been refutedand swept aside by the realities of life, and when the cardinal importance of mass political agitation has been elucidated and reiterated to the point of nausea. 
 The real basis of thisfear of conspiracy, of Blanquism, is not any feature to be found in the practical movement (as Bernstein and Co. 
 have long, and vainly, been trying to make out), but the Girondisttimidity of the bourgeois intellectual, whose mentality so often shows itself among the Social-Democrats of today. 
 Nothing could be more comical than these laborious effortsof the new Iskra to utter a new word of warning (uttered hundreds of times before) against the tactics of the French conspirator revolutionaries of the forties and sixties (No. 
 62,editorial). 
 117 In the next issue of Iskra , the Girondists of present-day Social-Democracy will no doubt show us a group of French conspirators of the forties for whom the impor-tance of political agitation among the working masses, the importance of the labour press as the principal means by which the party influences the class, was an elementarytruth they had learned and assimilated long ago. 
 However, the tendency of the new Iskra to repeat the elements and go back to the ABC while pretending to be uttering something new is not fortuitous; it is an inevi-table consequence of the situation Axelrod and Martov findthemselves in, now that they have landed in the opportunistwing of our Party. 
 There is nothing for it. 
 They have torepeat the opportunist phrases, they have to go back , in order to try to find in the remote past some sort of justi-fication for their position, which is indefensible from the point of view of the struggle at the Congress and of the shadesand divisions in the Party that took shape there. 
 To theAkimovite profundities about Jacobinism and Blanquism,Comrade Axelrod adds Akimovite lamentations to the effectthat not only the “Economists”, but the “politicians” as well, were “one-sided”, excessively “infatuated”, and so on and so forth. 
 Reading the high-flown disquisitions on this subjectin the new Iskra , which conceitedly claims to be above all this one-sidedness and infatuation, one asks in perplexity:whose portrait is it they are painting? where is it that theyhear such talk? 118 Who does not know that the division of the Russian Social-Democrats into Economists and politi-cians has long been obsolete? Go through the files of Iskra for the last year or two before the Party Congress, and youwill find that the fight against “Economism” subsided andcame to an end altogether as far back as 1902; you will find,for example, that in July 1903 (No. 
 43), “the times of Eco-nomism” are spoken of as being “definitely over”, Economism is considered “dead and buried”, and any infatuations of thepoliticians are regarded as obvious atavism. 
 Why, then,do the new editors, of Iskra revert to this dead and buried division? Did we fight the Akimovs at the Congress onaccount of the mistakes they made in Rabocheye Dyelo t wo years ago? If we had, we should have been sheer idiots. 
 But everyone knows that we did not, that it was not for theirold, dead and buried mistakes in Rabocheye Dyelo that we fought the Akimovs at the Congress, but for the new mistakes they committed in their arguments and their voting at theCongress. 
 It was not by their stand in Rabocheye Dyelo , but by their stand at the Congress, that we judged which mis-takes were really a thing of the past and which still livedand called for controversy. 
 By the time of the Congress the old division into Economists and politicians no longer exist-ed; but various opportunist trends continued to exist. 
 They found expression in the debates and voting on a number of issues, and finally led to a new division of the Party into“majority?” and “minority”. 
 The whole point is that the neweditors of Iskra are, for obvious reasons, trying to gloss over the connection between this new division and contem-porary opportunism in our Party, and are, in consequence, compelled to go back from the new division to the old one. 
 Their inability to explain the political origin of the newdivision (or their desire, in order to prove how accommodat-ing they are, to cast a veil * over its origin) compels them to keep harping on a division that has long been obsolete. 
Everyone knows that the new division is based on a differ-ence over questions of organisation , which began with the controversy over principles of organisation (Paragraph 1of the Rules) and ended up with a “practice” worthy ofanarchists. 
 The old division into Economists and politi-cians was based mainly on a difference over questions oftactics . 
 In its efforts to justify this retreat from the more com-plex, truly topical and burning issues of Party life to issuesthat have long been settled and have now been dug upartificially, the new Iskra resorts to an amusing display of profundity for which there can be no other name thantail-ism. 
 Started by Comrade Axelrod, there runs like a a crimson thread through all the writing of the new Iskra the profound “idea” that content is more important than *See Plekhanov’s article on “Economism” in No. 
 53 of Iskra . 
 The subtitle of the article appears to contain a slight misprint. 
 Instead of “Reflections on the Second Party Congress”, it should apparently read, “on the League Congress”, or even “on Co-optation ”. 
 However appropriate concessions to personal claims may be under certaincircumstances, it is quite inadmissible (from the Party, not the phili-stine standpoint) to confuse the issues that are agitating the Partyand to substitute for the new mistake of Martov and Axelrod, who have begun to swing from orthodoxy towards opportunism, the old mistake (never recalled today by anyone except the new Iskra ) of the Martynovs and Akimovs, who perhaps may now be prepared to swingfrom opportunism towards orthodoxy on many questions of programmeand tactics. 
 form, that programme and tactics are more important than organisation, that “the vitality of an organisation is in direct proportion to the volume and value of the content it puts into the movement”, that centralism is not an “endin itself”, not an “all-saving talisman”, etc. 
, etc. 
 Greatand profound truths! The programme is indeed more im-portant than tactics, and tactics more important thanorganisation. 
 The alphabet is more important than etymol-ogy, and etymology more important than syntax—but what would we say of people who, after failing in an examinationin syntax, went about pluming and priding themselves onbeing left in a lower class for another year? Comrade Axel-rod argued about principles of organisation like an oppor-tunist (Paragraph 1), and behaved inside the organisation like an anarchist (League Congress)—and now he is trying to render Social-Democracy more profound. 
 Sour grapes!What is organisation, properly speaking? Why, it is onlya form. 
 What is centralism? After all, it is not a talisman. 
What is syntax? Why, it is less important than etymology;it is only the form of combining the elements of etymology.... 
 “Will not Comrade Alexandrov agree with us,” the new edi-tors of Iskra triumphantly ask, “when we say that the Con-gress did much more for the centralisation of Party work bydrawing up a Party programme than by adopting Rules,however perfect the latter may seem?” (No. 
 56, Supplement. 
)It is to be hoped that this classical utterance will acquire a historic fame no less wide and no less lasting than Comrade Krichevsky’s celebrated remark that Social-Democracy,like mankind, always sets itself only such tasks as it canperform. 
 For the new Iskra ’s piece of profundity is of exactly the same stamp. 
 Why was Comrade Krichevsky’s phraseheld up to derision? Because he tried to justify the mistake of a section of the Social-Democrats in matters of tactics— their inability to set correct political tasks—by a common-place which he wanted to palm off as philosophy. 
 In exactlythe same way the new Iskra tries to justify the mistake of a section of the Social-Democrats in matters of organisa-tion—the intellectualist instability of certain comrades, which has led them to the point of anarchistic phrase-mongering—by the commonplace that the programme ismore important than the Rules, that questions of programme are more important than questions of organisation! What is this but tail-ism? What is it but pluming oneself on having been left in a lower class for another year? The adoption of a programme contributes more to the centralisation of the work than the adoption of Rules. 
 Howthis commonplace, palmed off as philosophy, reeks of thementality of the radical intellectual, who has much morein common with bourgeois decadence than with Social-Democracy! Why, the word centralisation is used in this famous phrase in a sense that is nothing but symbolical . 
 If the authors of the phrase are unable or disinclined tothink, they might at least have recalled the simple factthat the adoption of a programme together with the Bundists,far from leading to the centralisation of our common work, did not even save us from a split. 
 Unity on questions of programme and tactics is an essential but by no meansa sufficient condition for Party unity, for the centralisationof Party work (good God, what elementary things one hasto spell out nowadays, when all concepts have been confu-sed!). 
 The latter requires, in addition, unity of organisation, which, in a party that has grown to be anything more than a mere family circle, is inconceivable without formal Rules,without the subordination of the minority to the majorityand of the part to the whole. 
 As long as we had no unity onthe fundamental questions of programme and tactics, webluntly admitted that we were living in a period of disunity and separate circles, we bluntly declared that before we could unite, lines of demarcation must be drawn; we didnot even talk of the forms of a joint organisation, but exc-lusively discussed the new (at that time they really were new)problems of fighting opportunism on programme and tactics. 
At present, as we all agree, this fight has already produced a sufficient degree of unity, as formulated in the Party programme and the Party resolutions on tactics; we hadto take the next step, and, by common consent, we did takeit, working out the forms of a united organisation that would merge all the circles together. 
 But now these formshave been half destroyed and we have been dragged back, dragged back to anarchistic conduct, to anarchistic phrases, to the revival of a circle in place of a Party editorial board. 
And this step back is being justified on the plea that the alphabet is more helpful to literate speech than a knowledge of syntax! The philosophy of tail-ism, which flourished three years ago in questions of tactics, is being resurrected today inrelation to questions of organisation. 
 Take the followingargument of the new editors. 
 “The militant Social-Democrat-ic trend in the Party,” says Comrade Alexandrov, “shouldbe maintained not only by an ideological struggle, but by definite forms of organisation. 
” Whereupon the editors edifyingly remark: “Not bad, this juxtaposition of ideologicalstruggle and forms of organisation. 
 The ideological struggleis a process, whereas the forms of organisation are only ...forms [believe it or not, that is what they say—No. 
 56,Supplement, p. 
 4, bottom of col. 
 1!] designed to clothe a fluid and developing content—the developing practical work of the Party. 
” That is positively in the style of thejoke about a cannon-ball being a cannon-ball and a bomba bomb! The ideological struggle is a process, whereas theforms of organisation are only forms clothing the content!The point at issue is whether our ideological struggle is to have forms of a higher type to clothe it, the forms of a party organisation, binding on all, or the forms of the old disunityand the old circles. 
 We have been dragged back from higherto more primitive forms, and this is being justified on theplea that the ideological struggle is a process, whereasforms—are only forms. 
 That is just how Comrade Krichevsky in bygone days tried to drag us back from tactics-as-a-plan to tactics-as-a-process. 
 Take the new Iskra ’s pompous talk about the “self-training of the proletariat”, directed against those who are supposedto be in danger of missing the content because of the form(No. 
 58, editorial). 
 Is this not Akimovism No. 
 2? Akimovism No. 
 1 justified the backwardness of a section of the Social-Democratic intelligentsia in formulating tactical tasks bytalking about the more “profound” content of “the proletar-ian struggle” and the self-training of the proletariat. 
 Aki-movism No. 
 2 justifies the backwardness of a section of theSocial-Democratic intelligentsia in the theory and practice of organisation by equally profound talk about organisation being merely a form and the self-training of the proletariatthe important thing. 
 Let me tell you gentlemen who are so solicitous about the younger brother that the proletariat is not afraid of organisation and discipline! The proletariat will do nothing to have the worthy professors and high-school students who do not want to join an organisationrecognised as Party members merely because they workunder the control of an organisation. 
 The proletariat istrained for organisation by its whole life, far more radicallythan many an intellectual prig. 
 Having gained some under-standing of our programme and our tactics, the proletariat will not start justifying backwardness in organisation byarguing that the form is less important than the content. 
It is not the proletariat, but certain intellectuals in our Party who lack self-training in the spirit of organisation and discipline, in the spirit of hostility and contempt for anar-chistic talk. 
 When they say that it is not ripe for organisa-tion, the Akimovs No. 
 2 libel the proletariat just as the Aki-movs No. 
 1 libelled it when they said that it was not ripefor the political struggle. 
 The proletarian who has becomea conscious Social-Democrat and feels himself a member ofthe Party will reject tail-ism in matters of organisation with the same contempt as he rejected tail-ism in matters of tactics. 
 Finally, consider the profound wisdom of the new Iskra ’s “Practical Worker”. 
 “Properly understood,” he says, “theidea of a ‘militant’ centralist organisation uniting andcentralising the revolutionaries’ activities [the italics are to make it look more profound] can only materialise naturally if such activities exist [both new and clever!]; organisation itself, being a form [mark that!], can only grow simul-taneously [the italics are the author’s, as throughout this quotation] with the growth of the revolutionary work whichis its content. 
” (No. 
 57. 
) Does not this remind you very much of the character in the folk tale who, on seeing a funeral, cried: “Many happy returns of the day”? I am sure thereis not a practical worker (in the genuine sense of the term)in our Party who does not understand that it is preciselythe form of our activities (i. 
e. 
, our organisation) that haslong been lagging, and lagging desperately, behind their content, and that only the Simple Simons in the Party could shout to people who are lagging: “Keep in line; don’t runahead!” Compare our Party, let us say, with the Bund. 
 There can be no question but that the content * of the work of our Party is immeasurably richer, more varied, broader, and deeper than is the case with the Bund. 
 The scope of our theo-retical views is wider, our programme more developed, ourinfluence among the mass of the workers (and not merelyamong the organised artisans) broader and deeper, ourpropaganda and agitation more varied; the pulse of the polit-ical work of both leaders and rank and file is more lively, the popular movements during demonstrations and general strikes more impressive, and our work among the non-pro-letarian strata more energetic. 
 But the “form”? Comparedwith the Bund’s, the “form” of our work is lagging unpardon-ably, lagging so that it is an eyesore and brings a blush ofshame to the cheeks of anyone who does not merely “pick his teeth” when contemplating the affairs of his Party. 
 The fact that the organisation of our work lags behind its contentis our weak point, and it was our weak point long beforethe Congress, long before the Organising Committee wasformed. 
 The lame and undeveloped character of the formmakes any serious step in the further development of the content impossible; it causes a shameful stagnation, leads to a waste of energy, to a discrepancy between word anddeed. 
 We have all been suffering wretchedly from thisdiscrepancy, yet along come the Axelrods and “PracticalWorkers” of the new Iskra with their profound precept: the form must grow naturally, only simultaneously with the content! That is where a small mistake on the question of organisa-tion (Paragraph 1) will lead you if you try to lend profundity to nonsense and to find philosophical justification for oppor-tunist talk. 
 Marching slowly, in timid zigzags! 119 w e have heard this refrain in relation to questions of tactics; we are hearing it again in relation to questions of organisa-tion. 
 Tail-ism in questions of organisation is a natural and *I leave quite aside the fact that the content of our Party work was mapped out at the Congress (in the programme, etc. 
) in the spi-rit of revolutionary Social-Democracy only at the cost of a struggle , a struggle against those very anti-Iskra -ists and that very Marsh whose representatives numerically predominate in our “minority”. 
 On this question of “content” it would he interesting also to compare, let ussay, six issues of the old Iskra (Nos. 
 46-51) with twelve issues of the new Iskra (Nos. 
 52-63). 
 But that will have to wait for some other time. 
 inevitable product of the mentality of the anarchistic individ-ualist when he starts to elevate his anarchistic deviations (which at the outset may have been accidental) to a system of views , to special differences of principle . 
 At the League Congress we witnessed the beginnings of this anarchism; inthe new Iskra we are witnessing attempts to elevate it to a system of views. 
 These attempts strikingly confirm whatwas already said at the Party Congress about the difference between the points of view of the bourgeois intellectual who attaches himself to the Social-Democratic movement and theproletarian who has become conscious of his class interests. 
For instance, this same “Practical Worker” of the new Iskra with whose profundity we are already familiar denounces mefor visualising the Party “as an immense factory” headed by a director in the shape of the Central Committee (No. 
 57, Supplement). 
 “Practical Worker” never guesses that thisdreadful word of his immediately betrays the mentalityof the bourgeois intellectual unfamiliar with either thepractice or the theory of proletarian organisation. 
 Forthe factory, which seems only a bogey to some, represents that highest form of capitalist co-operation which has united and disciplined the proletariat, taught it to organise, andplaced it at the head of all the other sections of the toilingand exploited population. 
 And Marxism, the ideology of theproletariat trained by capitalism, has been and is teachingunstable intellectuals to distinguish between the factory as a means of exploitation (discipline based on fear of starva-tion) and the factory as a means of organisation (disciplinebased on collective work united by the conditions of a tech-nically highly developed form of production). 
 The disci-pline and organisation which come so hard to the bourgeoisintellectual are very easily acquired by the proletariat just because of this factory “schooling”. 
 Mortal fear of this school and utter failure to understand its importance as an organising factor are characteristic of the ways of thinking which reflect the petty-bourgeois mode of life and which give rise to the species of anarchism that the German Social-Democrats call Edelanarchismus , that is, the anar-chism of the “noble” gentleman, or aristocratic anarchism, as I would call it. 
 This aristocratic anarchism is particularly characteristic of the Russian nihilist. 
 He thinks of the Party organisation as a monstrous “factory”; he regards the subordi-nation of the part to the whole and of the minority to the majority as “serfdom” (see Axelrod’s articles); division of labour under the direction of a centre evokes from hima tragicomical outcry against transforming people into “cogsand wheels” (to turn editors into contributors being considereda particularly atrocious species of such transformation);mention of the organisational Rules of the Party calls forth a contemptuous grimace and the disdainful remark (intend-ed for the “formalists”) that one could very well dispensewith Rules altogether. 
 Incredible as it may seem, it was a didactic remark of just this sort that Comrade Martov addressed to me inIskra , No. 
 58, quoting, for greater weight, my own words in A Letter to a Comrade . 
 Well, what is it if not “aristocratic anarchism” and tail-ism to cite examples from the era ofdisunity, the era of the circles, to justify the preservation and glorification of the circle spirit and anarchy in the eraof the Party? Why did we not need Rules before? Because the Party consisted of separate circles without any organisational tiebetween them. 
 Any individual could pass from one circle toanother at his own “sweet will”, for he was not faced withany formulated expression of the will of the whole. 
 Disputeswithin the circles were not settled according to Rules,“but by struggle and threats to resign ”, as I put it in A Letter to a Comrade , * summarising the experience of a number of circles in general and of our own editorial circle of six inparticular. 
 In the era of the circles, this was natural andinevitable, but it never occurred to anybody to extol it,to regard it as ideal; everyone complained of the disunity,everyone was distressed by it and eager to see the isolated circles fused into a formally constituted party organisation. 
 And now that this fusion has taken place, we are beingdragged back and, under the guise of higher organisationalviews, treated to anarchistic phrase-mongering! To peopleaccustomed to the loose dressing-gown and slippers of theOblomov 120 circle domesticity, formal Rules seem narrow, restrictive, irksome, mean, and bureaucratic, a bond of *See present edition, Vol. 
 6, pp. 
 229-50. 
— Ed. 
 serfdom and a fetter on the free “process” of the ideological struggle. 
 Aristocratic anarchism cannot understand that formal Rules are needed precisely in order to replace the narrow circle ties by the broad Party tie. 
 It was unnecessaryand impossible to give formal shape to the internal ties of acircle or the ties between circles, for these ties rested onpersonal friendship or on an instinctive “confidence” forwhich no reason was given. 
 The Party tie cannot and must not rest on either of these; it must be founded on formal , “bureaucratically” worded Rules (bureaucratic from thestandpoint of the undisciplined intellectual), strict adherenceto which can alone safeguard us from the wilfulness and cap-rices characteristic of the circles, from the circle wranglingthat goes by the name of the free “process” of the ideological struggle. 
 The editors of the new Iskra try to trump Alexandrov with the didactic remark that “confidence is a delicate thingand cannot be hammered into people’s hearts and minds”(No. 
 56, Supplement). 
 The editors do not realise that bythis talk about confidence, naked confidence, they are once more betraying their aristocratic anarchism and organisa-tional tail-ism. 
 When I was a member of a circle only—whether it was the circle of the six editors or the Iskra organisation—I was entitled to justify my refusal, say, towork with X merely on the grounds of lack of confidence,without stating reason or motive. 
 But now that I have be-come a member of a party, I have no right to plead lack of con-fidence in general, for that would throw open the doors to allthe freaks and whims of the old circles; I am obliged to give formal reasons for my “confidence” or “lack of confidence”,that is, to cite a formally established principle of our pro-gramme, tactics or Rules; I must not just declare my “con-fidence” or “lack of confidence” without giving reasons, but must acknowledge that my decisions—and generally alldecisions of any section of the Party— have to be accounted for to the whole Party; I am obliged to adhere to a formally prescribed procedure when giving expression to my “lack of confidence” or trying to secure the acceptance of the views and wishes that follow from this lack of confidence. 
 From the circle view that “confidence” does not have to be accounted for, we have already risen to the Party view which demands adherence to a formally prescribed procedure of expressing, accounting for, and testing our confidence; but the editors try to drag us back, and call their tail-ism new views on organisation! Listen to the way our so-called Party editors talk about writers’ groups that might demand representation on theeditorial board. 
 “We shall not get indignant and begin toshout about discipline”, we are admonished by these aristo-cratic anarchists who have always and everywhere looked down on such a thing as discipline. 
 We shall either “arrangethe matter” ( sic!) with the group, if it is sensible, or just laugh at its demands. 
 Dear me, what a lofty and noble rebuff to vulgar “factory” formalism! But in reality it is the old circle phraseology furbished up a little and served up to the Party by an edi-torial board which feels that it is not a Party institution,but the survival of an old circle. 
 The intrinsic falsity of thisposition inevitably leads to the anarchistic profundity of elevating the disunity they hypocritically proclaim to bepast and gone to a principle of Social-Democratic organisa-tion. 
 There is no need for any hierarchy of higher and lower Party bodies and authorities—aristocratic anarchism regardssuch a hierarchy as the bureaucratic invention of ministries,departments, etc. 
 (see Axelrod’s article); there is no needfor the part to submit to the whole; there is no need for any“formal bureaucratic” definition of Party methods of “arrang-ing matters” or of delimiting differences. 
 Let the old circle wrangling be sanctified by pompous talk about “genuinelySocial-Democratic” methods of organisation. 
 This is, where the proletarian who has been through the school of the “factory” can and should teach a lesson toanarchistic individualism. 
 The class-conscious worker has long since emerged from the state of infancy when he used to fight shy of the intellectual as such. 
 The class-consciousworker appreciates the richer store of knowledge and thewider political outlook which he finds among Social-Demo-cratic intellectuals. 
 But as we proceed with the building ofa real party, the class-conscious worker must learn to distin-guish the mentality of the soldier of the proletarian army from the mentality of the bourgeois intellectual who paradesanarchistic phrases; he must learn to insist that the duties of a Party member be fulfilled not only by the rank and file, but by the “people at the top” as well; he must learn to treat tail-ism in matters of organisation with the same contempt as he used, in days gone by, to treat tail-ism inmatters of tactics! Inseparably connected with Girondism and aristocratic anarchism is the last characteristic feature of the new Iskra ’s attitude towards matters of organisation, namely, its defence of autonomism as against centralism. 
 This is the meaning in principle (if it has any such meaning *) of its outcry against bureaucracy and autocracy, of its regrets about“an undeserved disregard for the non-Iskra -ists” (who defend-ed autonomism at the Congress), of its comical howls abouta demand for “unquestioning obedience”, of its bitter com-plaints of “Jack-in-office rule”, etc. 
, etc. 
 The opportunist wing of any party always defends and justifies all backward-ness, whether in programme, tactics, or organisation. 
 Thenew Iskra ’s defence of backwardness in organisation (its tail-ism) is closely connected with the defence of autonomism . 
 True, autonomism has, generally speaking, been so discred-ited already by the three years’ propaganda work of the old Iskra that the new Iskra is ashamed, as yet , to advocate it-openly; it still assures us of its sympathy for centralism, butshows it only by printing the word centralism in italics. 
Actually, it is enough to apply the slightest touch of criti-cism to the “principles” of the “genuinely Social-Democrat-ic” (not anarchistic?) quasi-centralism of the new Iskra for the autonomist standpoint to be detected at every step. 
Is it not now clear to all and sundry that on the subject oforganisation Axelrod and Martov have swung over to Aki-mov? Have they not solemnly admitted it themselves inthe significant words, “undeserved disregard for the non-Iskra -ists”? And what was it but autonomism that Akimov and his friends defended at our Party Congress? It was autonomism (if not anarchism) that Martov and Axelrod defended at the League Congress when, with amus-ing zeal, they tried to prove that the part need not submitto the whole, that the part is autonomous in defining its *I leave aside here, as in this section generally, the “co-optational” meaning of this outcry. 
 relation to the whole, that the Rules of the League, in which that relation is formulated, are valid in defiance of the will of the Party majority, in defiance of the will of the Party centre. 
 And it is autonomism that Comrade Martov is nowopenly defending in the columns of the new Iskra (No. 
 60) in the matter of the right of the Central Committee toappoint members to the local committees. 
 I shall not speakof the puerile sophistries which Comrade Martov used to defend autonomism at the League Congress, and is still using in the new Iskra *—the important thing here is to note the undoubted tendency to defend autonomism against centralism , which is a fundamental characteristic of opportunism inmatters of organisation. 
 Perhaps the only attempt to analyse the concept bureau-cracy is the distinction drawn in the new Iskra (No. 
 53) between the “formal democratic principle” (author’s ital-ics) and the “formal bureaucratic principle”. 
 This distinction (which, unfortunately, was no more developed or explainedthan the reference to the non-Iskra -ists) contains a grain of truth. 
 Bureaucracy versus democracy is in fact central-ism versus autonomism; it is the organisational principle of revolutionary Social-Democracy as opposed to the organi-sational principle of opportunist Social-Democracy. 
 Thelatter strives to proceed from the bottom upward, and,therefore, wherever possible and as far as possible, upholdsautonomism and “democracy”, carried (by the overzealous) to the point of anarchism. 
 The former strives to proceed from the top downward, and upholds an extension of the rightsand powers of the centre in relation to the parts. 
 In theperiod of disunity and separate circles, this top from whichrevolutionary Social-Democracy strove to proceed organisa-tionally was inevitably one of the circles, the one enjoying most influence by virtue of its activity and its revolution-ary consistency (in our case, the Iskra organisation). 
 In the period of the restoration of actual Party unity and dis-*In enumerating various paragraphs of the Rules, Comrade Mar-tov omitted the one which deals with the relation of the whole to the part: the Central Committee “allocates the Party forces” (Paragraph 6). 
Can one allocate forces without transferring people from one commit-tee to another? It is positively awkward to have to dwell on such ele-mentary things. 
 solution of the obsolete circles in this unity, this top is inev-itably the Party Congress , as the supreme organ of the Party; the Congress as far as possible includes representatives of all the active organisations, and, by appointing the cen-tral institutions (often with a membership which satisfiesthe advanced elements of the Party more than the backwardand is more to the taste of its revolutionary than its oppor-tunist wing), makes them the top until the next Congress. 
 Such, at any rate, is the case among the Social-Democratic Europeans, although little by little this custom, so abhor-rent in principle to anarchists, is beginning to spread—notwithout difficulty and not without conflicts and squabbles—to the Social-Democratic Asiatics. 
 It is highly interesting to note that these fundamental characteristics of opportunism in matters of organisation (autonomism, aristocratic or intellectualist anarchism, tail-ism, and Girondism) are, mutatis mutandis with appropriate modifications), to be observed in all the Social-Democraticparties in the world, wherever there is a division into aa revolutionary and an opportunist wing (and where is there not?). 
 Only quite recently this was very strikingly revealed in the German Social-Democratic Party, when its defeatat the elections in the 20th electoral division of Saxony(known as the Göhre incident *) brought the question of the principles of party organisation to the fore. 
 That this inci-dent should have become an issue of principle was largely due to the zeal of the German opportunists. 
 Göhre (an ex-parson, author of the fairly well-known book Drei Monate Fabrikarbeiter ,** and one of the “heroes” of the Dresden Congress) is himself an extreme opportunist and the So-zialistische Monatshefte (Socialist Monthly ),122 the organ of the consistent German opportunists, at once “took up the cudgels” on his behalf. 
 *Göhre was returned to the Reichstag on June 16, 1903, from the 15th division of Saxony, but after the Dresden Congress121 he resigned his seat. 
 The electorate of the 20th division, which had fallen vacant on the death of Rosenow, wanted to put forward Göhre as candidate. 
 The Central Party Executive and the Regional Party Executive forSaxony opposed this, and while they had no formal right to forbidGöhre’s nomination, they succeeded in getting him to decline. 
 TheSocial-Democrats were defeated at the polls.

—Ed. 
 Opportunism in programme is naturally connected with opportunism in tactics and opportunism in organisation. 
 The exposition of the “new” point of view was undertaken by Comrade Wolfgang Heine. 
 To give the reader some ideaof the political complexion of this typical intellectual, whoon joining the Social-Democratic movement brought withhim opportunist habits of thought, it is enough to say thatComrade Wolfgang Heine is something less than a German Comrade Akimov and something more than a German Com-rade Egorov. 
 Comrade Wolfgang Heine took the field in the Sozial-istische Monatshefte with no less pomp than Comrade Axelrod in the new Iskra . 
 The very title of his article is priceless: “Democratic Observations on the Göhre Incident” ( Sozial-istische Monatshefte , No. 
 4, April). 
 The contents are no less thunderous. 
 Comrade W. 
 Heine rises up in arms against“encroachments on the autonomy of the constituency”,champions “the democratic principle”, and protests againstthe interference of an “appointed authority” (i. 
e. 
, the CentralParty Executive) in the free election of deputies by the people. 
 The point at issue, Comrade W. 
 Heine admonishes us, is not a random incident, but a general “ tendency towards bureaucracy and centralism in the Party ”, a tendency, he says, which was to be observed before, but which is nowbecoming particularly dangerous. 
 It must be “recognised asa principle that the local institutions of the Party are the vehicles of Party life” (a plagiarism on Comrade Martov’s pamphlet Once More in the Minority ). 
 We must not “accus-tom ourselves to having all important political decisionscome from one centre”, and must warn the Party against “adoctrinaire policy which loses contact with life” (borrowedfrom Comrade Martov’s speech at the Party Congress to the effect that “life will assert itself”). 
 Rendering his argument more profound, Comrade W. 
 Heine says: “...If we go down tothe roots of the matter and leave aside personal conflicts,which here, as everywhere, have played no small part, thisbitterness against the revisionists [the italics are the author’s and evidently hint at a distinction between fighting revision-ism and fighting revisionists] will be found to be mainly expressive of the distrust of the Party officialdom for ‘ out-siders ’ [W. 
 Heine had apparently not yet read the pamphlet about combating the state of siege, and therefore resorted to an Anglicism— Outsidertum ], the distrust of tradition for the unusual, of the impersonal institution for everything individual [see Axelrod’s resolution at the League Congresson the suppression of individual initiative]—in short, ofthat tendency which we have defined above as a tendencytowards bureaucracy and centralism in the Party. 
” The idea of “discipline” inspires Comrade W. 
 Heine with a no less noble disgust than Comrade Axelrod.... 
 “The revisionists,” he writes, “have been accused of lack ofdiscipline for having written for the Sozialistische Monats-hefte , an organ whose Social-Democratic character has even been denied because it is not controlled by the Party . 
 This very attempt to narrow down the concept ‘Social-Democrat-ic’, this insistence on discipline in the sphere of ideological production, where absolute freedom should prevail [remem-ber: the ideological struggle is a process whereas the formsof organisation are only forms], demonstrates the tendencytowards bureaucracy and the suppression of individuality”. 
And W. 
 Heine goes on and on, fulminating against this de-testable tendency to create “ one big all-embracing organisa-tion, as centralised as possible, one set of tactics, and one theory”, against the demand for “implicit obedience”,“blind submission”, against “oversimplified centralism”,etc. 
, etc. 
, literally “ à la Axelrod”. 
 The controversy started by W. 
 Heine spread, and as there were no squabbles about co-optation in the German Party to obscure the issue, and as the German Akimovs displaytheir complexion not only at congresses, but all the time, ina periodical of their own, the argument soon boiled downto an analysis of the principles of the orthodox and revi-sionist trends on the question of organisation. 
 Karl Kautsky came forward (in the Neue Zeit , 1904, No. 
 28, in the article “Wahlkreis und Partei ”—“Constituency and Party”) as one of the spokesmen of the revolutionary trend (which, exactlyas in our Party, was of course accused of “dictatorship”,“inquisitorial” tendencies, and other dreadful things). 
W. 
 Heine’s article, he says, “expresses the line of thought of the whole revisionist trend”. 
 Not only in Germany, but in France and Italy as well, the opportunists are all staunchsupporters of autonomism, of a slackening of Party disci-pline, of reducing it to naught; everywhere their tendencies lead to disorganisation and to perverting “the democratic principle” into anarchism . 
 “Democracy does not mean absence of authority,” Karl Kautsky informs the opportun-ists on the subject of organisation, “democracy does notmean anarchy; it means the rule of the masses over their rep-resentatives, in distinction to other forms of rule, where thesupposed servants of the people are in reality their masters. 
” Kautsky traces at length the disruptive role played by oppor-tunist autonomism in various countries; he shows that it isprecisely the influx of “ a great number of bourgeois elements ” * into the Social-Democratic movement that is strengthening opportunism, autonomism, and the tendency to violate dis-cipline; and once more he reminds us that “organisation is the weapon that will emancipate the proletariat”, that “organisation is the characteristic weapon of the proletariatin the class struggle”. 
 In Germany, where opportunism is weaker than in France or Italy, “autonomist tendencies have so far led only to moreor less passionate declamations against dictators and grand inquisitors, against excommunication ** and heresy-hunting, and to endless cavilling and squabbling, which would onlyresult in endless strife if replied to by the other side”. 
 It is not surprising that in Russia, where opportunism in the Party is even weaker than in Germany, autonomisttendencies should have produced fewer ideas and more “passionate declamations” and squabbling. 
 It is not surprising that Kautsky arrives at the following conclusion: “There is perhaps no other question on whichrevisionism in all countries, despite its multiplicity of formand hue, is so alike as on the question of organisation. 
”Kautsky, too, defines the basic tendencies of orthodoxy and revisionism in this sphere with the help of the “dreadful word”: bureaucracy versus democracy. 
 We are told, he says, that to give the Party leadership the right to influence the *Kautsky mentions Jaurès as an example. 
 The more these people deviated towards opportunism, the more “they were bound to considerParty discipline an impermissible constraint on their free personality”. 
 **Bannstrahl : excommunication. 
 This is the German equivalent of the Russian “state of siege” and “emergency laws”. 
 It is the “dread-ful word” of the German opportunists. 
 selection of candidates (for parliament) by the constituencies is “a shameful encroachment on the democratic principle,which demands that all political activity proceed from thebottom upward, by the independent activity of the masses,and not from the top downward, in a bureaucratic way.... 
But if there is any democratic principle, it is that the major-ity must have predominance over the minority, and not the other way round.... 
” The election of a member of par-liament by any constituency is an important matter forthe Party as a whole, which should influence the nominationof candidates, if only through its representatives ( Vertrauens-männer ). 
 “Whoever considers this too bureaucratic or centralistic let him suggest that candidates be nominated by the direct vote of the Party membership at large [ sämtliche Parteigenossen ]. 
 If he thinks this is not practicable, he must not complain of a lack of democracy when this function,like many others that concern the Party as a whole, isexercised by one or several Party bodies. 
” It has long been “common law” in the German Party for constituencies to “come to a friendly understanding” with the Party leader-ship about the choice of candidates. 
 “But the Party has growntoo big for this tacit common law to suffice any longer. 
Common law ceases to be law when it ceases to be accepted as a matter of course, when its stipulations, and even its very existence, are called in question. 
 Then it becomesnecessary to formulate the law specifically, to codify it” ...to go over to more “precise statutory definition * [statutarische Festlegung ] and, accordingly, greater strictness [ grössere Straffheit ] of organisation”. 
 Thus you have, in a different environment, the same struggle between the opportunist and the revolutionarywing of the Party on the question of organisation, the sameconflict between autonomism and centralism, between demo-cracy and “bureaucracy”, between the tendency to relax *It is highly instructive to compare these remarks of Kautsky’s about the replacement of a tacitly recognised common law by a for-mally defined statutory law with that whole “change-over” which our Party in general, and the editorial board in particular, have been undergoing since the Party Congress. 
 Cf. 
 the speech of V. 
 I. 
 Zasulich(at the League Congress, p. 
 66 et seq. 
), who does not seem to realisethe full significance of this change-over. 
 and the tendency to tighten organisation and discipline, between the mentality of the unstable intellectual and that of the staunch proletarian, between intellectualist individ-ualism and proletarian solidarity. 
 What, one asks, was theattitude to this conflict of bourgeois democracy —not the bourgeois democracy which prankish history has only pro-mised in private to show to Comrade Axelrod some day,but the real and actual bourgeois democracy which in Ger-many has spokesmen no less shrewd and observant than our own gentlemen of Osvobozhdeniye ? German bourgeois demo-cracy at once reacted to the new controversy, and—likeRussian bourgeois democracy, like bourgeois democracyeverywhere and always—sided solidly with the opportunistwing of the Social-Democratic Party. 
 The Frankfurter Zeitung , leading organ of the German stock exchange, pub-lished a thunderous editorial ( Frankfurter Zeitung , April 7, 1904, No. 
 97, evening edition) which shows that shame-less plagiarising of Axelrod is becoming a veritable diseasewith the German press. 
 The stern democrats of the Frankfortstock exchange lash out furiously at the “absolutism” in the Social-Democratic Party, at the “party dictatorship”, at the “autocratic rule of the Party authorities”, at the “inter-dicts” which are intended “concurrently to chastise revision-ism as a whole” (recall the “false accusation of opportun-ism”), at the insistence on “blind obedience”, “deadeningdiscipline”, “servile subordination”, and the transforming of Party members into “political corpses” (that is a good bit stronger than cogs and wheels!). 
 “All distinctiveness ofpersonality”, the knights of the stock exchange indignantlyexclaim at the sight of the undemocratic regime among theSocial-Democrats, “all individuality is to be held in oppro-brium, because it is feared that they might lead to the French order of things, to Jaurèsism and Millerandism, as was stated in so many words by Sindermann, who made the reporton the subject” at the Party Congress of the Saxon Social-Democrats . 
 And so, insofar as the new catchwords of the new Iskra on organisation contain any principles at all, there can be nodoubt that they are opportunist principles. 
 This conclu-sion is confirmed both by the whole analysis of our Party Congress, which divided into a revolutionary and an oppor-tunist wing, and by the example of all European Social-Democratic parties, where opportunism in organisationfinds expression in the same tendencies, in the same accu-sations, and very often in the same catchwords. 
 Of course,the national peculiarities of the various parties and thedifferent political conditions in different countries leave their impress and make German opportunism quite dissimi-lar from French, French opportunism from Italian, andItalian opportunism from Russian. 
 But the similarity ofthe fundamental division of all these parties into a revolu-tionary and an opportunist wing, the similarity of the lineof thought and the tendencies of opportunism in organisation stand out clearly in spite of all this difference of conditions. 
 * With large numbers of radical intellectuals in the ranks of our Marxists and our Social-Democrats, the opportunismwhich their mentality produces has been, and is, boundto exist, in the most varied spheres and in the most variedforms. 
 We fought opportunism on the fundamental prob-lems of our world conception, on the questions of our programme, and the complete divergence of aims inevitablyled to an irrevocable break between the Social-Democratsand the liberals who had corrupted our legal Marxism. 
We fought opportunism on tactical issues, and our diver-gence with Comrades Krichevsky and Akimov on these less important issues was naturally only temporary, and was not accompanied by the formation of different parties. 
 We mustnow vanquish the opportunism of Martov and Axelrod on *No one will doubt today that the old division of the Russian Social-Democrats into Economists and politicians on questions of tactics was similar to the division of the whole international Social-Democratic movement into opportunists and revolutionaries, althoughthe difference between Comrades Martynov and Akimov, on the one hand, and Comrades von Vollmar and von Elm or Jaurès and Mille-rand, on the other, is very great. 
 Nor can there be any doubt aboutthe similarity of the main divisions on questions of organisation, in spite of the enormous difference between the conditions of politically unenfranchised and politically free countries. 
 It is extremely character-istic that the highly principled editors of the new Iskra , while briefly touching on the controversy between Kautsky and Heine (No. 
 64), timidly evaded discussing the trends of principle manifested on ques-tions of organisation by opportunism and orthodoxy generally . 
 questions of organisation, which are, of course, less funda-mental than questions of tactics, let alone of programme, but which have now come to the forefront in our Party life. 
 When we speak of fighting opportunism, we must never forget a characteristic feature of present-day opportunismin every sphere, namely, its vagueness, amorphousness,elusiveness. 
 An opportunist, by his very nature, will always evade taking a clear and decisive stand, he will always seek a middle course, he will always wriggle like a snakebetween two mutually exclusive points of view and tryto “agree” with both and reduce his differences of opinionto petty amendments, doubts, innocent and pious sugges-tions, and so on and so forth. 
 Comrade Eduard Bernstein, an opportunist in questions of programme, “agrees” with the revolutionary programme of his party, and althoughhe would no doubt like to have it “radically revised”, heconsiders this untimely, inexpedient, not so important asthe elucidation of “general principles” of “criticism” (whichmainly consist in uncritically borrowing principles and catchwords from bourgeois democracy). 
 Comrade von Voll-mar, an opportunist in questions of tactics, also agrees withthe old tactics of revolutionary Social-Democracy and alsoconiines himself mostly to declamations, petty amendments,and sneers rather than openly advocates any definite “mini-sterial” tactics. 
 123 Comrades Martov and Axelrod, opportun-ists in questions of organisation, have also failed so far to produce, though directly challenged to do so, any definitestatement of principles that could be “fixed by statute”;they too would like, they most certainly would like,a “radical revision” of our Rules of Organisation ( Iskra No. 
 58, p. 
 2, col. 
 3), but they would prefer to devote them-selves first to “general problems of organisation” (for a really radical revision of our Rules, which, in spite of Paragraph 1,are centralist Rules, would inevitably lead, if carried outin the spirit of the new Iskra , to autonomism; and Comrade Martov, of course, does not like to admit even to himselfthat he tends in principle towards autonomism). 
 Their “principles” of organisation therefore display all the colours of the rainbow. 
 The predominant item consists of innocentpassionate declamations against autocracy and bureaucracy, against blind obedience and cogs and wheels—declamations so innocent that it is still very difficult to discern in them what is really concerned with principle and what is really concerned with co-optation. 
 But as it goes on, the thinggets worse: attempts to analyse and precisely define thisdetestable “bureaucracy” inevitably lead to autonomism;attempts to “lend profundity” to their stand and vindicateit inevitably lead to justifying backwardness, to tail-ism, to Girondist phrase-mongering. 
 At last there emerges the principle of anarchism , as the sole really definite principle, which for that reason stands out in practice in particularrelief (practice is always in advance of theory). 
 Sneeringat discipline—autonomism—anarchism—there you have theladder which our opportunism in matters of organisation now climbs and now descends, skipping from rung to rung and skilfully dodging any definite statement of its prin-ciples. 
 * Exactly the same stages are displayed by oppor-*Those who recall the debate on Paragraph 1 will now clearly see that the mistake committed by Comrade Martov and ComradeAxelrod over Paragraph 1 had inevitably to lead, when developed and deepened, to opportunism in matters of organisation. 
 Comrade Mar-tov’s fundamental idea—self-enrolment in the Party—was this same false “democracy”, the idea of building the Party from the bottom upward. 
 My idea, on the other hand, was “bureaucratic” in the sensethat the Party was to be built from the top downward, from the PartyCongress to the individual Party organisations. 
 The mentality ofthe bourgeois intellectual, anarchistic phrase-mongering, and opportun-ist, tail-ist profundity were all already displayed in the debate on Paragraph 1. 
 Comrade Martov says in his State of Siege (p. 
 20) that “new ideas are beginning to be worked out” by the new Iskra . 
 That is true in the sense that he and Axelrod are really pushing ideas in anew direction, beginning with Paragraph 1. 
 The only trouble is thatthis direction is an opportunist one. 
 The more they “work” in this direction, and the more this work is cleared of squabbling over co-optation, the deeper will they sink in the mire. 
 Comrade Plekhanov already perceived this clearly at the Party Congress, and in his article“What Should Not Be Done” warned them once again: I am prepared, heas much as said, even to co-opt you, only don’t continue along thisroad which can only lead to opportunism and anarchism. 
 Martovand Axelrod would not follow this good advice: What? Not continue along this road? Agree with Lenin that the co-optation clamour is nothing but squabbling? Never! We’ll show him that we are men ofprinciple!—And they have. 
 They have clearly shown everyone thatif they have any new principles at all, they are opportunist principles. 
 tunism in matters of programme and tactics: sneering at “orthodoxy”, narrowness, and immobility—revisionist “cri-ticism” and ministerialism—bourgeois democracy. 
 There is a close psychological connection between this hatred of discipline and that incessant nagging note ofinjury which is to be detected in all the writings of all opportunists today in general, and of our minority in partic-ular. 
 They are being persecuted, hounded, ejected, besieged, and bullied. 
 There is far more psychological and political truth in these catchwords than was probably suspected evenby the author of the pleasant and witty joke about bulliesand bullied. 
 For you have only to take the minutes of ourParty Congress to see that the minority are all those whosuffer from a sense of injury, all those who at one time or another and for one reason or another were offended by the revolutionary Social-Democrats. 
 There are the Bundistsand the Rabocheye Dyelo -ists, whom we “offended” so badly that they withdrew from the Congress: there are the Yuzhny Rabochy -ists, who were mortally offended by the slaughter of organisations in general and of their own in particular; there is Comrade Makhov, who had to put up with offence every time he took the floor (for every time he did, he invari-ably made a fool of himself); and lastly, there are ComradeMartov and Comrade Axelrod, who were offended by the“false accusation of opportunism” in connection with Para-graph 1 of the Rules and by their defeat in the elections. 
 All these mortal offences were not the accidental outcome of impermissible witticisms, rude behaviour, frenzied con-troversy, slamming of doors, and shaking of fists, as somany philistines imagine to this day, but the inevitablepolitical outcome of the whole three years’ ideological workof Iskra . 
 If in the course of these three years we were not just wagging our tongues, but giving expression to convic-tions which were to be translated into deeds, we could notbut fight the anti-Iskra -ists and the “Marsh” at the Congress. 
 And when, together with Comrade Martov, who had foughtin the front line with visor up, we had offended such heapsof people, we had only to offend Comrade Axelrod and Com-rade Martov ever such a little bit for the cup to overflow. 
 Quantity was transformed into quality. 
 The negation wasnegated. 
 All the offended forgot their mutual scores, fell weeping into each other’s arms, and raised the banner of “revolt against Leninism”. 
 * A revolt is a splendid thing when it is the advanced ele-ments who revolt against the reactionary elements. 
 Whenthe revolutionary wing revolts against the opportunistwing, it is a good thing. 
 When the opportunist wing revoltsagainst the revolutionary wing, it is a bad business. 
 Comrade Plekhanov is compelled to take part in this bad business in the capacity of a prisoner of war, so to speak. 
 He tries to “vent his spleen” by fishing out isolated awkwardphrases by the author of some resolution in favour of the“majority”, and exclaiming: “Poor Comrade Lenin! A finelot his orthodox supporters are!” ( Iskra , No. 
 63, Supple-ments. 
) Well, Comrade Plekhanov, all I can say is that if I am poor, the editors of the new Iskra are downright paupers. 
 However poor I may be, I have not yet reached such utterdestitution as to have to shut my eyes to the Party Con-gress and hunt for material for the exercise of my wit inthe resolutions of committeemen. 
 However poor I may be, I am a thousand times better off than those whose supporters do not utter an awkward phrase inadvertently, but on everyissue—whether of organisation, tactics, or programme—adhere stubbornly and persistently to principles which arethe very opposite of the principles of revolutionary Social-Democracy. 
 However poor I may be, I have not yet reached the stage of having to conceal from the public the praises lav-ished on me by such supporters. 
 And that is what the editorsof the new Iskra have to do. 
 Reader, do you know what the Voronezh Committee of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party stands for? If not,read the minutes of the Party Congress. 
 You will learn from them that the line of that committee is wholly expressed by Comrade Akimov and Comrade Brouckère, who at theCongress fought the revolutionary wing of the Party allalong the line, and who scores of times were ranked as oppor-*This amazing expression is Comrade Martov’s ( State of Siege , p. 
 68). 
 Comrade Martov waited until he was five to one before raisingthe “revolt” against me alone. 
 Comrade Martov argues very unskilfully:he wants to destroy his opponent by paying him the highest compli-ments. 
 tunists by everybody, from Comrade Plekhanov to Com-rade Popov. 
 Well, this Voronezh Committee, in its January leaflet (No. 
 12, January 1904), makes the following state-ment: “A great and important event in the life of our steadily growing Party took place last year: the Second Congress of the R.

, a congress of the representatives of its organisations. 
 Convening a Party congress is a very complicated matter, and, under the prevailing mo-narchical regime, a very dangerous and difficult one. 
 It is therefore not surprising that it was carried out in a far from perfect way , and that the Congress itself, although it passed off without mishap, didnot live up to all the Party’s expectations. 
 The comrades whom the Conference of 1902 commissioned to convene the Congress were arrested, and the Congress was arranged by persons who represented only one of the trends in Russian Social-Democracy , viz. 
, the ‘Iskra ’-ists. 
 Many organi-sations of Social-Democrats who did not happen to be Iskra -ists were not invited to take part in the work of the Congress, partly for this reason the task of drawing up a programme and Rules for the Party was carried out by the Congress in an extremely imperfect manner ; the dele-gates themselves admit that there are important flaws in the Rules‘which may lead to dangerous misunderstandings’. 
 The Iskra -ists themselves split at the Congress, and many prominent members of our R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 who formerly appeared to be in full agreement withthe Iskra programme of action have come to see that many of its views, advocated mainly by Lenin and Plekhanov , are impracticable. 
 Although these last gained the upper hand at the Congress, the pulseof real life and the requirements of the practical work, in which all the non-Iskra -ists are taking part, are quickly correcting the mistakes of the theoreticians and have, since the Congress, already introducedimportant modifications. 
 ‘ Iskra ’ has changed greatly and promises t o pay careful heed to the demands of all workers in the Social-Democrat-ic movement generally. 
 Thus, although the results of the Congress will have to be revised at the next Congress, and, as is obvious to the dele-gates themselves, are unsatisfactory and therefore cannot be accepted by the Party as unimpeachable decisions , the Congress clarified the situa-tion in the Party, provided much material for the further theoretical and organising activity of the Party, and was an experience of immense instructive value for the work of the Party as a whole. 
 The decisionsof the Congress and the Rules it drew up will be taken into account by all the organisations, but many will refrain from being guided by them exclusively , in view of their manifest imperfections. 
 “Fully realising the importance of the work of the Party as a whole, the Voronezh Committee actively responded in all matters concerning the organisation of the Congress. 
 It fully appreciates the importanceof what took place at the Congress and welcomes the change undergone by ‘Iskra ’, which has become the Central Organ (chief organ). 
 Although the state of affairs in the Party and the Central Committee does not satisfy us as yet , we are confident that /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR by joint efforts the difficult work of organising the Party will be perfected. 
 In view of false rumours, the Voronezh Committee informs the comrades that there is no question of the Voronezh Committee leaving the Party. 
 The Voronezh Committee perfectly realises what a dangerous precedentwould be created by the withdrawal of a workers’ organisa-tion like the Voronezh Committee from the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
, what a reproach this would be to the Party , and how disadvan-tageous it would be to workers’ organisations which might follow this example. 
 We must not cause new splits, but persistently strive to unite all class-conscious workers andsocialists in one party. 
 Besides, the Second Congress was not a constituent congress, but only a regular one. 
 Expulsion from the Party can only be by decision of a Party court, andno organisation, not even the Central Committee, has the right to expel any Social-Democratic organisation from the Party. 
 Furthermore, under Paragraph 8 of the Rules adoptedby the Second Congress every organisation is autonomous in its local affairs, and the Voronezh Committee is accordingly fully entitled to put its views on organisation into practiceand to advocate them in the Party . 
” The editors of the new Iskra , in quoting this leaflet in No. 
 61, reprinted the second half of this tirade, which we give here in large type; as for the first half, here printed in small type, the editors preferred to omit it . 
 They were ashamed. 
 R. 
 A FEW WORDS ON DIALECTICS. 
 TWO REVOLUTIONS A general glance at the development of our Party crisis will readily show that in the main, with minor exceptions, the composition of the two contending sides remained un-changed throughout. 
 It was a struggle between the revolu-tionary wing and the opportunist wing in our Party. 
 But thisstruggle passed through the most varied stages, and anyonewho wants to find his bearings in the vast amount of litera-ture already accumulated, the mass of fragmentary evidence, passages torn from their context, isolated accusations, and so on and so forth, must thoroughly familiarise himself with the peculiarities of each of these stages. 
 Let us enumerate the principal and clearly distinct stages: 1) The controversy over Paragraph 1 of the Rules. 
A purely ideological struggle over the basic principles oforganisation. 
 Plekhanov and I are in the minority. 
 Martovand Axelrod propose an opportunist formulation and findthemselves in the arms of the opportunists. 
 2) The split in the Iskra organisation over the lists of candidates for the Central Committee: Fomin or Vasilyev in a committee offive, Trotsky or Travinsky in a committee of three. 
 Plekha-nov and I gain the majority (nine to seven), partly becauseof the very fact that we were in the minority on Paragraph 1. 
Martov’s coalition with the opportunists confirmed my worst fears over the Organising Committee incident. 
 3) Continua-tion of the controversy over details of the Rules. 
 Martov isagain saved by the opportunists. 
 We are again in the minor-ity and fight for the rights of the minority on the centralbodies. 
 4) The seven extreme opportunists withdraw fromthe Congress. 
 We become the majority and defeat the coali-tion (the Iskra -ist minority, the “Marsh”, and the anti-Iskra -ists) in the elections. 
 Martov and Popov decline to accept seats in our trios. 
 5) The post-Congress squabble overco-optation. 
 An orgy of anarchistic behaviour and anarchisticphrase-mongering. 
 The least stable and steadfast elementsamong the “minority” gain the upper hand. 
 6) To avert a split, Plekhanov adopts the policy of “killing with kindness”. 
 The “minority” occupy the editorial board of the CentralOrgan and the Council and attack the Central Committeewith all their might. 
 The squabble continues to pervadeeverything. 
 7) First attack on the Central Committee re-pulsed. 
 The squabble seems to be subsiding somewhat. 
 It be-comes possible to discuss in comparative calm two purely ideological questions which profoundly agitate the Party:a) what is the political significance and explanation of thedivision of our Party into “majority” and “minority” whichtook shape at the Second Congress and superseded all earlierdivisions? b) what is the significance in principle of the new Iskra ’s new position on the question of organisation? In each of these stages the circumstances of the struggle and the immediate object of the attack are materially differ-ent; each stage is, as it were, a separate battle in one general military campaign. 
 Our struggle cannot be understood at all unless the concrete circumstances of each battle are studied. 
 But once that is done, we see clearly that develop-ment does indeed proceed dialectically, by way of contradic-tions: the minority becomes the majority, and the majoritybecomes the minority; each side passes from the defensiveto the offensive, and from the offensive to the defensive; the starting-point of ideological struggle (Paragraph 1) is “negated” and gives place to an all-pervading squabble *; but then begins “the negation of the negation”, and, havingjust about managed to “rub along” with our god-given wifeon different central bodies, we return to the starting-point,the purely ideological struggle; but by now this “thesis” has been enriched by all the results of the “antithesis” and has become a higher synthesis, in which the isolated, randomerror over Paragraph 1 has grown into a quasi-system ofopportunist views on matters of organisation, and in whichthe connection between this fact and the basic division of ourParty into a revolutionary and an opportunist wing becomes increasingly apparent to all. 
 In a word, not only do oats grow according to Hegel, but the Russian Social-Democratswar among themselves according to Hegel. 
 But the great Hegelian dialectics which Marxism made its own, having first turned it right side up, must neverbe confused with the vulgar trick of justifying the zigzags of politicians who swing over from the revolutionary to the opportunist wing of the Party, with the vulgar habitof lumping together particular statements, and particulardevelopmental factors, belonging to different stages of asingle process. 
 Genuine dialectics does not justify the errorsof individuals, but studies the inevitable turns, proving that they were inevitable by a detailed study of the process of development in all its concreteness. 
 One of the basicprinciples of dialectics is that there is no such thing asabstract truth, truth is always concrete.... 
 And, one thing *The difficult problem of drawing a line between squabbling and differences of principle now solves itself: all that relates to co-optation is squabbling; all that relates to analysis of the struggle at the Con-gress, to the controversy over Paragraph I and the swing towards. 
Opportunism and anarchism is a difference of principle. 
 more, the great Hegelian dialectics should never be confused with that vulgar worldly wisdom so well expressed by the Italian saying: mettere la coda dove non va il capo (sticking in the tail where the head will not go through). 
 The outcome of the dialectical development of our Party struggle has been two revolutions. 
 The Party Congress wasa real revolution, as Comrade Martov justly remarked in hisOnce More in the Minority . 
 The wits of the minority are also right when they say: “The world moves through revolutions; well, we have made a revolution!” They did indeed makea revolution after the Congress; and it is true, too, thatgenerally speaking the world does move through revolutions. 
But the concrete significance of each concrete revolution isnot defined by this general aphorism; there are revolutions which are more like reaction, to paraphrase the unforgettable expression of the unforgettable Comrade Makhov. 
 We mustknow whether it was the revolutionary or the opportunistwing of the Party that was the actual force that made therevolution, must know whether it was revolutionary oropportunist principles that inspired the fighters, before we can determine whether a particular concrete revolution moved the “world” (our Party) forward or backward. 
 Our Party Congress was unique and unprecedented in the entire history of the Russian revolutionary movement. 
For the first time a secret revolutionary party succeededin emerging from the darkness of underground life into broad daylight, showing everyone the whole course and outcome of our internal Party struggle, the whole character of ourParty and of each of its more or less noticeable componentsin matters of programme, tactics, and organisation. 
 Forthe first time we succeeded in throwing off the traditionsof circle looseness and revolutionary philistinism, in bring-ing together dozens of very different groups, many of which had been fiercely warring among themselves and had beenlinked solely by the force of an idea, and which were nowprepared (in principle, that is) to sacrifice all their groupaloofness and group independence for the sake of the greatwhole which we were for the first time actually creating— the Party . 
 But in politics sacrifices are not obtained gratis, they have to be won in battle. 
 The battle over the slaughterof organisations necessarily proved terribly fierce. 
 The fresh breeze of free and open struggle blew into a gale. 
 The gale swept away—and a very good thing that it did!—each and every remnant of all circle interests, sentiments, and traditions without exception, and for the first time createdgenuinely Party institutions. 
 But it is one thing to call oneself something, and another to be it. 
 It is one thing to sacrifice the circle system in prin-ciple for the sake of the Party, and another to renounce one’s own circle. 
 The fresh breeze proved too fresh as yet for people used to musty philistinism. 
 “The Party was unable tostand the strain of its first congress,” as Comrade Martovrightly put it (inadvertently) in his Once More in the Minori-ty. 
 The sense of injury over the slaughter of organisations was too strong. 
 The furious gale raised all the mud from the bottom of our Party stream; and the mud took its revenge. 
 The old hidebound circle spirit overpowered the still youngparty spirit. 
 The opportunist wing of the Party, routedthough it had been, got the better—temporarily, of course—of the revolutionary wing, having been reinforced by Aki-mov’s accidental gain. 
 The result is the new Iskra , which is compelled to develop and deepen the error its editors committed at the PartyCongress. 
 The old Iskra taught the truths of revolutionary struggle. 
 The new Iskra teaches the worldly wisdom of yielding and getting on with everyone. 
 The old Iskra was the organ of militant orthodoxy. 
 The new Iskra treats us to a recrudescence of opportunism—chiefly on questions of organisation. 
 The old Iskra earned the honour of being detested by the opportunists, both Russian and West-Euro-pean. 
 The new Iskra has “grown wise” and will soon cease to be ashamed of the praises lavished on it by the extremeopportunists. 
 The old Iskra marched unswervingly towards its goal, and there was no discrepancy between its word and its deed. 
 The inherent falsity of the new Iskra ’s position inevitably leads—independently even of anyone’s will orintention—to political hypocrisy. 
 It inveighs against thecircle spirit in order to conceal the victory of the circle spiritover the party spirit. 
 It hypocritically condemns splits, as if one can imagine any way of avoiding splits in any at all organised party except by the subordination of the minorityto the majority. 
 It says that heed must be paid to revolution-ary public opinion, yet, while concealing the praises of the Akimovs, indulges in petty scandal-mongering about the committees of the revolutionary wing of the Party. 
 * How shameful! How they have disgraced our old Iskra ! One step forward, two steps back.... 
 It happens in the lives of individuals, and it happens in the history of nationsand in the development of parties. 
 It would be the most criminal cowardice to doubt even for a moment the inevitable and complete triumph of the principles of revolutionarySocial-Democracy, of proletarian organisation and Party discipline. 
 We have already won a great deal, and we must go on fighting, undismayed by reverses, fighting stead-fastly, scorning the philistine methods of circle wran-gling, doing our very utmost to preserve the hard-won single Party tie linking all Russian Social-Democrats, andstriving by dint of persistent and systematic work to give all Party members, and the workers in particular, a full and conscious understanding of the duties of Party mem-bers, of the struggle at the Second Party Congress, of all the causes and all the stages of our divergence, and of the utter disastrousness of opportunism, which, in the sphereof organisation as in the sphere of our programme and our tactics, helplessly surrenders to the bourgeois psychology, uncritically adopts the point of view of bourgeois democracy,and blunts the weapon of the class struggle of the proletariat. 
 In its struggle for power the proletariat has no other weapon but organisation. 
 Disunited by the rule of anar-chic competition in the bourgeois world, ground down by forced labour for capital, constantly thrust back to the “lower depths” of utter destitution, savagery, and degener-ation, the proletariat can, and inevitably will, become an invincible force only through its ideological unification on the principles of Marxism being reinforced by the mate-rial unity of organisation, which welds millions of toilers into an army of the working class. 
 Neither the senile rule of the Russian autocracy nor the senescent rule of inter-national capital will be able to withstand this army. 
 It will *A stereotyped form has even been worked out for this charming pastime: our special correspondent X informs us that Committee Yof the majority has behaved badly to Comrade Z of the minority. 
 more and more firmly close its ranks, in spite of all zigzags and backward steps, in spite of the opportunist phrase-mongering of the Girondists of present-day Social-Democra-cy, in spite of the self-satisfied exaltation of the retrograde circle spirit, and in spite of the tinsel and fuss of intellectual-ist anarchism. 
 Appendix THE INCIDENT OF COMRADE GUSEV AND COMRADE DEUTSCH This incident is closely bound up with the so-called “false” (Comrade Martov’s expression) list mentioned in the letter of Comrades Martov and Starover, which has beenquoted in Section J. 
 The substance of it is as follows. 
 Com-rade Gusev informed Comrade Pavlovich that this list, con-sisting of Comrades Stein, Egorov, Popov, Trotsky, andFomin, had been communicated to him, Gusev, by Comrade Deutsch (Comrade Pavlovich’s Letter , p. 
 12). 
 Comrade Deutsch accused Comrade Gusev of “deliberate calumny”on account of this statement, and a comrades’ arbitrationcourt declared Comrade Gusev’s “statement” “ incorrect ” (see the court’s decision in Iskra , No. 
 62). 
 After the editorial board of Iskra had published the court decision, Comrade Martov (not the editorial board this time) issued a special leaflet entitled The Decision of the Comrades ’ Arbitration Court , in which he reprinted in full, not only the decision of the court, but the whole report of the proceedings, togetherwith a postscript of his own . 
 In this postscript, Comrade Mar-tov among other things spoke of “the disgraceful fact of the forgery of a list in the interests of a factional struggle”. 
 Comrades Lyadov and Gorin, who had been delegates to theSecond Congress, replied to this leaflet with one of their ownentitled An Onlooker at the Arbitration Court , in which they “vigorously protest against Comrade Martov permitting him-self to go further than the court decision and to ascribe evil motives to Comrade Gusev”, whereas the court did not find that there had been a deliberate calumny, but only that Com-rade Gusev’s statement was incorrect. 
 Comrades Gorin and Lyadov explained at length that Comrade Gusev’s statement might have been due to a quite natural mistake, and des-cribed as “ unworthy ” the conduct of Comrade Martov, who had himself made (and again made in his leaflet) a numberof erroneous statements, arbitrarily attributing evil intentto Comrade Gusev. 
 There could be no evil intent there atall, they said. 
 That, if I am not mistaken, is all the “liter-ature” on this question, which I consider it my duty to help clear up. 
 First of all, it is essential that the reader have a clear idea of the time and conditions in which this list (of candidatesfor the Central Committee) appeared. 
 As I have alreadystated in this pamphlet, the Iskra organisation conferred during the Congress about a list of candidates for the Central Committee which it could jointly submit to the Congress. 
 The conference ended in disagreement: the majority of theIskra organisation adopted a list consisting of Travinsky, Glebov, Vasilyev, Popov, and Trotsky, but the minorityrefused to yield and insisted on a list consisting of Travinsky,Glebov, Fomin, Popov, and Trotsky. 
 The two sections of the Iskra organisation did not meet together again after the meeting at which these lists were put forward and voted on. 
Both sections entered the arena of free agitation at the Con-gress, wishing to have the issue between them settled bya vote of the Party Congress as a whole and each trying towin as many delegates as it could to its side. 
 This free agita-tion at the Congress at once revealed the political fact I have analysed in such detail in this pamphlet, namely, that inorder to gain the victory over us, it was essential for theIskra -ist minority (headed by Martov) to have the support of the “Centre” (the Marsh) and of the anti-Iskra -ists. 
 This was essential because the vast majority of the delegates who con-sistently upheld the programme, tactics, and organisational plans of Iskra against the onslaught of the anti-Iskra -ists and the “Centre” very quickly and very staunchly tooktheir stand on our side. 
 Of the thirty-three delegates (orrather votes) not belonging to the anti-Iskra -ists or the “Centre”, we very quickly won twenty-four and concluded a “direct agreement” with them, forming a “compact majori-ty”. 
 Comrade Martov, on the other hand, was left with onlynine votes; to gain the victory, he needed all the votes of the anti-Iskra -ists and the “Centre”—with which groups he might join forces (as over Paragraph 1 of the Rules), might form a “coalition”, that is, might have their support, but with which he could not conclude a direct agreement—could not do so because throughout the Congress he had foughtthese groups no less sharply than we had. 
 Therein lay thetragicomedy of Comrade Martov’s position! In his State of Siege Comrade Martov tries to annihilate me with the deadly venomous question: “We would respectfully request Comrade Lenin to answer explicitly— to whom at the Congress were the Yuzhny Rabochy group an outside element?” (P. 
 23, footnote. 
) I answer respectfully and explicitly:they were an outside element to Comrade Martov. 
 And theproof is that whereas I very quickly concluded a direct agreement with the Iskra -ists, Comrade Martov did not conclude, and could not have concluded, a direct agreementwith Yuzhny Rabochy , nor with Comrade Makhov, nor with Comrade Brouckère. 
 Only when we have got a clear idea of this political situa-tion can we understand the “crux” of this vexed question of the celebrated “false” list. 
 Picture to yourself the actual state of affairs: the Iskra organisation has split, and we are freely campaigning at the Congress, defending our respectivelists. 
 During this defence, in the host of private conversa-tions, the lists are varied in a hundred different combina-tions: a committee of three is proposed instead of five; all sorts of substitutions of one candidate for another are sug-gested. 
 I very well recall, for instance, that the candida-tures of Comrades Rusov, Osipov, Pavlovich, and Dyedov 124 were suggested in private conversations among the majority,and then, after discussions and arguments, were withdrawn. 
It may very well be that other candidatures too were pro-posed of which I have no knowledge. 
 In the course of these conversations each Congress delegate expressed his opinion,suggested changes, argued, and so on. 
 It is highly unlikelythat this was the case only among the majority. 
 There isno doubt, in fact, that the same sort of thing went on amongthe minority, for their original five (Popov, Trotsky, Fomin, Glebov, and Travinsky) were later replaced, as we have seen from the letter of Comrades Martov and Starover, by a trio—Glebov, Trotsky, and Popov—Glebov, moreover, not being to their taste, so that they were very ready to substitute Fomin (see the leaflet of Comrades Lyadov and Gorin). 
 It should not be forgotten that my demarcation of the Con-gress delegates into the groups defined in this pamphletwas made on the basis of an analysis undertaken post-factum; actually, during the election agitation these groupswere only just beginning to emerge and the exchange of opin-ions among the delegates proceeded quite freely; no “wall” divided us, and each would speak to any delegate he wanted to discuss matters with in private. 
 It is not at all surpris-ing in these circumstances that among all the various com-binations and lists there should appear, alongside the listof the minority of the Iskra organisation (Popov, Trotsky, Fomin, Glebov, and Travinsky), the not very different list: Popov, Trotsky, Fomin, Stein, and Egorov. 
 The appearance of such a combination of candidates was very natural,because our candidates, Glebov and Travinsky, were patentlynot to the liking of the minority of the Iskra organisation (see their letter in Section J, where they remove Travinskyfrom the trio and expressly state that Glebov is a compro-mise). 
 To replace Glebov and Travinsky by the Organising Committee members Stein and Egorov was perfectly natural,and it would have been strange if no one of the delegatesbelonging to the Party minority had thought of it. 
 Let us now examine the following two questions: 1) Who was the author of the list: Egorov, Stein, Popov, Trotsky, and Fomin? and 2) Why was Comrade Martov so profoundly incensed that such a list should be attributed to him? Togive an exact answer to the first question, it would be neces-sary to question all the Congress delegates. 
 That is now im-possible. 
 It would be necessary, in particular, to ascertainwho of the delegates belonging to the Party minority (not to be confused with the Iskra organisation minority) had heard at the Congress of the lists that caused the split in theIskra organisation; what they had thought of the respective lists of the majority and minority of the Iskra organisation; and whether they had not suggested or heard others suggestor express opinions about desirable changes in the list of the minority of the Iskra organisation. 
 Unfortunately, these questions do not seem to have been raised in the arbitrationcourt either, which (to judge by the text of its decision) did not even learn over just what lists of five the Iskra organisa-tion split. 
 Comrade Byelov, for example (whom I class among the “Centre”), “testified that he had been on good comradely terms with Deutsch, who used to give him his impressions ofthe work of the Congress, and that if Deutsch had beencampaigning on behalf of any list he would have informedByelov of the fact. 
” It is to be regretted that it was notbrought out whether Comrade Deutsch gave Comrade Byelov at the Congress his impressions as to the lists of the Iskra organisation, and if he did, what was Comrade Byelov’sreaction to the list of five proposed by the Iskra organisation minority, and whether he did not suggest or hear others sug-gest any desirable changes in it. 
 Because this was not madeclear, we get that contradiction in the evidence of Comrade Byelov and Comrade Deutsch which has already been noted by Comrades Gorin and Lyadov, namely, that ComradeDeutsch, notwithstanding his own assertions to the contrary,did “campaign in behalf of certain Central Committee candi-dates” suggested by the Iskra organisation. 
 Comrade Byelov further testified that “he had heard about the list circulating at the Congress a couple of days before the Congress closed, in private conversation, when he met Comrades Egorovand Popov and the delegates from the Kharkov Committee. 
Egorov had expressed surprise that his name had been includ-ed in a list of Central Committee candidates, as in his, Ego-rov’s, opinion his candidature could not inspire sympathy among the Congress delegates, whether of the majority or of the minority”. 
 It is extremely significant that the referencehere is apparently to the minority of the “Iskra ” organisation , for among the rest of the Party Congress minority the candi-dature of Comrade Egorov, a member of the OrganisingCommittee and a prominent speaker of the “Centre”, not only could, but in all likelihood would have been greeted sympathetically. 
 Unfortunately, we learn nothing fromComrade Byelov as to the sympathy or antipathy of thoseamong the Party minority who did not belong to the Iskra organisation. 
 And yet that is just what is important, forComrade Deutsch waxed indignant about this list having been attributed to the minority of the Iskra organisation, whereas it may have originated with the minority whichdid not belong to that organisation! Of course, it is very difficult at this date to recall who first suggested this combination of candidates, and from whom each of us heard about it. 
 I, for example, do not undertake to recall even just who among the majority firstproposed the candidatures of Rusov, Dyedov, and the othersI have mentioned. 
 The only thing that sticks in my memory,out of the host of conversations, suggestions, and rumours ofall sorts of combinations of candidates, is those “lists” which were directly put to the vote in the Iskra organisation or at the private meetings of the majority. 
 These “lists” were most-ly circulated orally (in my Letter to the Editors of “Iskra ”, p. 
 4, line 5 from below, it is the combination of five candidateswhich I orally proposed at the meeting that I call a “list”);but it also happened very often that they were jotted down in notes, such as in general passed between delegates during the sittings of the Congress and were usually destroyed afterthe sittings. 
 Since we have no exact information as to the origin of this celebrated list, it can only be assumed that the combi-nation of candidates which we have in it was either suggested by some delegate belonging to the Party minority, without the knowledge of the Iskra organisation minority, and there-after began to circulate at the Congress in spoken and writtenform; or else that this combination was suggested at theCongress by some member of the Iskra organisation minority who subsequently forgot about it. 
 The latter assumption seems to me the more likely one, for the following reasons: already at the Congress the Iskra organisation minority were undoubtedly sympathetic towards the candidature of Comrade Stein (see present pamphlet); and as to the candida-ture of Comrade Egorov, this minority did undoubtedly arrive at the idea after the Congress (for both at the League Congress and in State of Siege regret was expressed that the Organising Committee had not been endorsed as the CentralCommittee—and Comrade Egorov was a member of theOrganising Committee). 
 Is it then not natural to assumethat this idea, which was evidently in the air, of convertingthe members of the Organising Committee into members of the Central Committee was voiced by some member of the minority in private conversation at the Party Congresstoo? But instead of a natural explanation, Comrade Martov and Comrade Deutsch are determined to see here something sordid —a plot, a piece of dishonesty, the dissemination of “deliberately false rumours with the object of defaming”, a “forgery in the interests of a factional struggle ”, and so forth. 
 This morbid urge can only be explained by the unwholesomeconditions of émigré life, or by an abnormal nervous condi-tion, and I would not even have taken the question up if matters had not gone to the length of an unworthy attack upon a comrade’s honour. 
 Just think: what grounds couldComrades Deutsch and Martov have had for detecting asordid, evil intent in an incorrect statement, in an incor-rect rumour? The picture which their morbid imaginationsconjured up was apparently that the majority “defamed” them, not by pointing to the minority’s political mistake (Paragraph 1 and the coalition with the opportunists),but by ascribing to the minority “deliberately false” and“forged” lists. 
 The minority preferred to attribute thematter not to their own mistake, but to sordid, dishonest,and disgraceful practices on the part of the majority! How irrational it was to seek for evil intent in the “incorrect statement”, we have already shown above, by describingthe circumstances. 
 It was clearly realised by the comrades’arbitration court too, which did not find any calumny, orany evil intent, or anything disgraceful. 
 Lastly, it is mostclearly proved by the fact that at the Party Congress itself, prior to the elections, the minority of the Iskra organi-sation entered into discussions with the majority regard-ing this false rumour, and Comrade Martov even statedhis views in a letter which was read at a meeting of all thetwenty-four delegates of the majority! It never even occurredto the majority to conceal from the minority of the Iskra organisation that such a list was circulating at the Congress: Comrade Lensky told Comrade Deutsch about it (see thecourt decision); Comrade Plekhanov spoke of it to ComradeZasulich (“You can’t talk to her, she seems to take me forTrepov,” 125 Comrade Plekhanov said to me, and this joke, repeated many times after, is one more indication of the abnormal state of excitement the minority were in); and I informed Comrade Martov that his assurance (that the listwas not his, Martov’s) was quite enough for me (League Minutes, p. 
 64). 
 Comrade Martov (together with Comrade Starover, if I remember rightly) thereupon sent a note to us on the Bureau which ran roughly as follows: “The majority of the Iskra editorial board request to be allowed to attend the private meeting of the majority in order to refute thedefamatory rumours which are being circulated aboutthem. 
” Plekhanov and I replied on the same slip of paper,saying: “We have not heard any defamatory rumours. 
 If a meeting of the editorial board is required, that should be arranged separately. 
 Lenin, Plekhanov. 
” At the meetingof the majority held that evening, we related this to allthe twenty-four delegates. 
 To preclude all possible misunder-standing, it was decided to elect delegates from all the twen-ty-four of us jointly and send them to talk it over with Comrades Martov and Starover. 
 The delegates elected, Com-rades Sorokin and Sablina, went and explained that nobodywas specifically attributing the list to Martov or Starover,particularly after their statement, and that it was of abso-lutely no importance whether this list originated with theminority of the Iskra organisation or with the Congress minority not belonging to that organisation. 
 After all, we could not start an investigation at the Congress and questionall the delegates about this list! But Comrades Martov andStarover, not content with this, sent us a letter containinga formal denial (see Section J). 
 This letter was read out byour representatives, Comrades Sorokin and Sablina, at a meeting of the twenty-four. 
 It might have seemed that the incident could be considered closed—not in the sensethat the origin of the list had been ascertained (if anybodycared about that), but in the sense that the idea had beencompletely dispelled that there was any intention of “injur-ing the minority”, or of “defaming” anybody, or of resorting to a “forgery in the interests of a factional struggle”. 
 Yet at the League Congress (pp. 
 63-64) Comrade Martov againbrought forth this sordid story conjured up by a morbidimagination, and, what is more, made a number of incorrect statements (evidently due to his wrought-up condition). 
 He said that the list included a Bundist. 
 That was untrue. 
 All the witnesses in the arbitration court, including Comrades Stein and Byelov, declared that the list had Comrade Egorovin it, Comrade Martov said that the list implied a coalition in the sense of a direct agreement. 
 That was untrue, as I have already explained. 
 Comrade Martov said that there were no other lists originating with the minority of the Iskra organisation (and likely to repel the majority of the Congress from this minority), “not even forged ones”. 
 Thatwas untrue, for the entire majority at the Party Congressknew of no less than three lists which originated with Com-rade Martov and Co. 
, and which did not meet with the approv-al of the majority (see the leaflet by Lyadov and Gorin). 
 Why, in general, was Comrade Martov so incensed by this list? Because it signified a swing towards the Rightwing of the Party. 
 At that time Comrade Martov cried outagainst a “false accusation of opportunism” and expressedindignation at the “misrepresentation of his political posi-tion”; but now everybody can see that the question whether this list belonged to Comrade Martov and Comrade Deutschcould have had no political significance whatever, and thatessentially , apart from this or any other list , the accusation was not false, but true, and the characterisation of his po-litical position absolutely correct. 
 The upshot of this painful and artificial affair of the cele-brated false list is as follows: 1) One cannot but join Comrades Gorin and Lyadov in describing as unworthy Comrade Martov’s attempt to asperseComrade Gusev’s honour by crying about a “disgracefulfact of the forgery of a list in the interests of a factional struggle”. 
 2) With the object of creating a healthier atmosphere and of sparing Party members the necessity of taking every mor-bid extravagance seriously, it would perhaps be advisableat the Third Congress to adopt a rule such as is contained inthe Rules of Organisation of the German Social-Democratic Labour Party. 
 Paragraph 2 of these Rules runs: “No person can belong to the Party who is guilty of a gross violationof the principles of the Party programme or of dishonourableconduct. 
 The question of continued membership in the Partyshall be decided by a court of arbitration convened by theParty Executive. 
 One half of the judges shall be nominated by the person demanding the expulsion, the other half by the person whose expulsion is demanded; the chairman shall beappointed by the Party Executive. 
 An appeal against a decision of the court of arbitration may be made to the Control Commission or to the Party Congress. 
” Such a rule might serve as a good weapon against all who frivolously level accusations (or spread rumours) of dishonourableconduct. 
 If there were such a rule, all such accusations wouldonce and for all be classed as indecent slanders unless theirauthor had the moral courage to come forward before the Party in the role of accuser and seek for a verdict from the compe-tent Party institution. 
 LETTER TO THE MEMBERS OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE Dear Friends, Boris has informed me that five Central Committee mem-bers (he, Loshad, Valentin, Mitrofan,126 and Travinsky) have passed a vote of censure on me for having voted in theCouncil in favour of a congress and for agitating on behalfof a congress. 
 I request each of the five to confirm this fact or to explain it to me, for I cannot conceive how a member of a body can be censured for doing what it is his right andduty to do. 
 You may not agree with him, you may recallI him from the Council, but to “censure” him is strange indeed;for as long as I sat on the Council I could not do otherwise than vote in accordance with my convictions. 
 And to agitate for a congress is likewise the right of every Party member and every member of the Central Committee, so that thepowers of a Party body in relation to its members do notentitle it (either formally or morally ) to restrict any of us in the exercise of that right. 
 All I am obliged to do is toannounce that half or more of the Central Committee are opposed to a congress. 
 As regards the Council, the matter has now been arranged as follows: Boris has been appointed (by five votes, he says)in place of Kol. 
 My resignation (he says) has not been accept-ed. 
 I withdraw my resignation and remain on the Council. 
As far as that is concerned, the conflict has been settled, and I only ask for an explanation of the “censure”. 
 But far more important is the following conflict: Boris has informed me that he finds it impossible to remain amember of the Central Committee unless I (1) stop agitat-ing for a congress, and (2) work against a congress. 
 Natural-ly, I can do neither of these things, and I have accordingly told Boris that I shall discuss the matter with all m y colleagues on the Central Committee and shall then let him have my reply , which will say whether I am resigning from the Central Committee or not. 
 As regards this conflict, which threatens to lead to the resignation of one of us (or even of one of the two sections of the Central Committee), I consider it of the utmost importance to discuss it thor-oughly, without heat, and with a proper knowledge of thefacts. 
 I think Boris is much to blame for having presentedhis “ultimatum” without reading either the Council minutes (highly important!) or my pamphlet, * in which I set forth the principles on which I take my stand. 
 Is it wise to aggra-vate the conflict without going to the bottom of the matter,which is a highly complicated one?? Is it wise to aggravateit when basically we agree (at any rate, the declaration writ-ten in the name of the Central Committee by Valentin, whichwas sent to us but did not reach us and which Boris told me about, stresses our common stand on principles of organisa-tion, as against the opportunist stand of the minority)?Even as regards the congress, we differ only as to the date,for Boris has no objection to a congress being convened sixmonths or a year later. 
 See what emerges. 
 According to theRules, there should be a congress next summer; I consider that at best , assuming that our agitation is an unqualified success, it will be impossible to convene one in under six months, and most likely it will take even longer. 
 It turns out that our “difference” boils down to a matter of the date!Does it make sense to part company over that? Look at thematter from the purely political angle: Boris declares that agitation for a congress is incompatible with building up positive work, that the former is injurious to the latter. 
I do not agree that they are incompatible; but even assumingthat Boris is right, what would be the result if he succeededin getting those who disagree with him about this to resignfrom the Central Committee? The result would unques-tionably be to intensify the agitation enormously, to exacer-bate relations between the majority and the Central Com-mittee, and to aggravate for Boris himself the business—which he finds so unpleasant—of working against a congress. 
Is there any sense in aggravating matters in this way?Boris says that he is against a congress because it would mean a split. 
 I think he misjudges the position as it is today *See pp. 
 201-423 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 and as it is likely to be tomorrow; but even if he is right, by securing our resignation from the Central Committee he would enormously increase the likelihood of a split, because he would undoubtedly be aggravating the situation. 
 Toaggravate the conflict within the Central Committee wouldbe unwise from any angle. 
 Essentially, the only difference of opinion between Boris and me is that he considers a split at the Third Congress inevitable, while I consider it unlikely. 
 We both believe that the majority at the Third Congress will be on our side. 
Boris thinks that the minority will leave the Party: neitherwe nor Martov, he feels, will be able to restrain the extrem-ists. 
 I think that he fails to take account of the swiftlymoving situation, which today is not what it was yesterday, and tomorrow will not be what it is today. 
 Boris sees the situation as it existed yesterday (when the squabbling pushedprinciples into the background, when there could be hopes of smoothing things over, of toning them down, of personalconcessions being successful). 
 That situation exists no long-er, as I show at length in my pamphlet, and as is shown by the general dissatisfaction with the new Iskra (even on the part of such mild people as the writers’ group of theCentral Committee in Russia). 
 The situation today is dif-ferent: principles are pushing the squabbling into the back-ground. 
 Today it is no longer co-optation that is the issuenot by any means. 
 The issue is whether the new “Iskra ” is right in principle . 
 And it is the dissatisfaction with the new Iskra ’s principles, which is bound to keep growing, that is producing an ever stronger agitation for a congress. 
That is what Boris does not appreciate. 
 Tomorrow the squab-bling will recede even further into the background. 
 Onthe one hand, the minority will not be in a position, morally and politically, to quit (the moment for that which existed after the League Congress is gone ). 
 On the other hand, as I already declared at the Council (I once more beg you all to be sure to read the Council minutes before rushing at thisdifficult problem), we by no means refuse to make terms. 
I say to all and sundry that I for one am absolutely prepared (1) to give all the old editors a guarantee that everything they write will be published at the Party’s expense, withoutalteration or comment; (2) to suspend until the Fourth Congress the Central Committee’s right to appoint and dis-miss members of the local committees; (3) to guarantee, in a special resolution, the more sensitively-felt rights of the minority , and even (4) conditionally , a s a l a s t r e s o r t , to make Iskra neutral, keeping its columns free of mutual controversy (with the help of a commission of practicalworkers from both sides, etc. 
). 
 I think that under such cir-cumstances the minority at the Third Congress, being only a small minority, will not venture to withdraw from the Congress. 
 I think that at the Third Congress we shall, byformally adopted decisions, finally dispel the fantasy ofa “state of siege” and bring about a position where contro-versies will take their course without interfering with pos-itive work . 
 And that, after all, is the crux of the whole crisis, that is what I tried to secure at the Council, and four-fifths of the congress are bound to support it! I know verywell that this is what Boris wants too, but there is no achiev-ing it without a congress. 
 Boris is mistaken in thinkingthat we started the onslaught (by agitating for a congress)and that put the minority’s back up. 
 Quite the contrary: it was only after a number of letters and appeals, prior to the Council and at the Council itself, that we pronouncedfor a congress, and by the agitation we have only shown ourstrength a little. 
 Whoever does not want to land in theridiculous (if not worse) position of Plekhanov (read hisarticle in No. 
 65) must frankly and openly take up a stand in the struggle. 
 Nothing can now stop the agitation for a congress. 
 One must be tolerant—neutral, if you will—towards it, and then it will not interfere with positive work. 
To rage against this agitation is useless. 
 I earnestly request a reply from each of the Central Commit-tee members. 
 It is essential to come to an understanding and clear up the matter, so that we may work together, not without some differences, perhaps, but without conflictsand without attempts to oust one another. 
 Written on May 13 (26), 1904 Published, with some changes, Published according in the pamphlet to the manuscript The Fight for a Congress , by N. 
 Shakhov, Geneva, 1904 STATEMENT BY THREE MEMBERS OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE The three Central Committee members Glebov , Zverev ,127 and Lenin , having discussed the differences within the Cen-tral Committee, have arrived at the following conclusions, which shall be communicated to all members of the Central Committee: 1) The differences arose over the question of summoning a congress. 
 After Lenin and Vasilyev had declared in theParty Council in favour of a congress, the majority of theCentral Committee (by five votes to four, Travinsky ’s vote having been transferred to Comrade Glebov ) declared against a congress. 
 Lenin and Vasilyev thereupon announced their provisional resignation from the Council. 
 This con-flict has now been adjusted * by having Glebov and Lenin serve as the Central Committee’s representatives on the Council. 
 2) Comrade Glebov has informed Comrade Lenin that he, Glebov, will resign from the Central Committee unless Lenin gives up agitating (outside the Central Committee)for a congress and works against a congress. 
 Lenin, consid-ering such an attitude to the question wrong and imper-missible in principle, states that he will canvass the opinionof each of the Central Committee members and will then give his reply, which can only be whether he, Lenin, is resigning from the Central Committee or not. 
 (What appliesto Lenin likewise applies, from Comrade Glebov ’s standpoint, to all Central Committee members sharing Lenin’s view. 
) 3) To give an accurate picture of the differences within the Central Committee at the present time, it should be *Concerning this see the letter by Lenin appended hereto, which has been approved by Comrade Glebov . 
 (Pp. 
 424-27 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
) stated that Comrade Valentin and Comrade Nikitich ,128 in the declaration written by them in March and approved by Comrade Glebov , stated (1) that they were emphatically opposed to co-optation at the demand of the minority; (2)that they shared the views on organisation set out in thepamphlet What Is To Be Done? and (3) that they, or at least two of them, did not approve of the opportunist positionof certain Party writers. 
 As regards a congress, Comrade Glebov is convinced (1) that the difference on this question is causing a duality of policy in the Central Committee, and(2) that a congress may lead to a split. 
 It is because he doesnot wish to assume responsibility for this that he declareshimself bound to resign from the Central Committee. 
 Lenin,on the other hand, considers that the Central Committee, being a body accountable to the congress, must be neutral in the matter of the congress and allow all its members free-dom of agitation. 
 As to a split, it is unlikely, for the major-ity are prepared in principle to make terms at the congress,even to the point of neutralising Iskra . 
 4) Pending settlement of this conflict all official steps and statements by Comrade Glebov and Comrade Lenin on behalf of the Central Committee shall only be undertakenby their common consent and over their joint signatures.

( Plekhanov : “Yes, it would be desirable. 
”) “The Polish Socialist Party has always believed in the needfor close association between the Polish and Russian social-ist camps with a view to making the struggle against the common enemy—tsarism—more effective.

 We realise that theprolonged absence of regular contacts between you and our-selves has given rise to a number of mutual misunderstandingsand dissonances, which must be settled and smoothed outbefore the final framing of the desired agreement can be un-dertaken. 
 Accordingly, our Central Working Committee has decided to propose to you that a conference should be heldabroad at an early date at which delegates from your Partycould discuss with three delegates of ours the possibilitiesand conditions for joint struggle by our two parties.

 It also inquired how the P.

 The P. 
S. 
P. 
 replied with the following letter: “Dear Comrades, “We were somewhat surprised by your letter, for it seems to us that the answers to the questions it asks are already contained in our original letter. 
 The conference we proposewould be of a preliminary nature, to explore the possibil-ities of closer association between our parties; it could, forexample, work out the draft of a permanent agreement. 
 “Our three delegates to negotiate with you have been appointed by the Central Committee, which is between con-gresses the highest authority in our Party. 
 Presumably thedelegates you appoint to negotiate with us will representthe corresponding authority in your Party, or whateverbody the powers to conduct such negotiations are vested in. 
 “We would propose meeting at some place abroad. 
 The actual spot is a secondary matter, though Vienna would suit us best. 
 The delegates have been appointed by our CentralCommittee to negotiate with your Party, and not the Social-Democratic Party of Poland and Lithuania, and there cantherefore be no question of delegates from the latter partic-ipating.

” As regards Comrade Martov’s proposal for a prior confer-ence of Social-Democratic groups only, I doubt whether this is advisable, because besides the Bund, the Polish So-cial-Democrats, and the Proletariat Party, 131 there are other Social-Democratic organisations in the border regions, which it would hardly be convenient to invite to the confer-ence, while if not invited they might be offended. 
 II Comrades Axelrod and Martov say the Letts have two groups. 
 ( Martov : “Two trends. 
”) The way it comes out now is that we are to hold a conference with the one that gravi-tates towards the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Osvobozhde-niye and inclines towards terrorism (according to Comrade Axelrod), while the other group is very weak. 
 We mustfind out more exactly how matters stand. 
 If they are merelytwo trends, that is no concern of ours and we are joining forces with what is the Lettish Party. 
 But if they are distinct groups, we may land in a very awkward position by choosingthe wrong one. 
 We must first find out both their strengthand their complexion. 
 As for the Caucasus, it should, Ithink, be brought into the conference. 
 For that we must findout if there are Social-Democratic organisations there which could make common cause with us. 
 2 SPEECHES ON CO-OPTATION TO THE COMMITTEES AND THE RIGHT OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE TO APPOINT NEW MEMBERS TO THEM JUNE 5 (18) I In this resolution, irrespective of its practical conclusion, I would suggest altering the beginning. 
 Since we cannot passany decisions on the rights and wrongs of the Moscow dispute for lack of sufficient information, the resolution ought not to be linked up either with any disputes there have been. 
I would in general propose that where one part of an organi-sation lodges a complaint against the other, the other partshould be notified, so as to have a chance to put its case too. 
For example, as regards the Moscow dispute things were not as Comrade Martov says they were. 
 According to my information, three out of the five members wanted to co-opttwo new members to the committee, and the rest werewilling, only provided another member from their side wasco-opted too, which would still have maintained—and evenstrengthened—the predominant trend. 
 It was only the ma-jority’s categorical refusal to agree to this combination that made the Moscow comrades want to invoke the Rules. 
 Andwhile one Central Committee member was in favour of thecommittee majority’s interpretation of the Rules, anotherCentral Committee representative opposed it. 
 I say this only by way of a statement of fact and to have it recorded in the minutes. 
 And so, I move that the begin-ning of Comrade Martov’s resolution be altered so that itwill lay down a definite ruling to operate henceforth, in the future. 
 As for the ruling itself, I would suggest that all fractions be treated as a full unit. 
 II This incident goes to show anew that in cases where one side lodges a complaint, the other side should at once be noti-fied, so that it may offer its explanations. 
 Only in that case shall we be in a position to adopt appropriate decisions on the disputes. 
 According to our information, what hap-pened was this. 
 The Nikolayev Committee consisted of peoplebelonging to the majority. 
 Then all of them were arrested. 
Thereupon the Central Committee, or possibly a representa-tive of it, appointed three members to the Nikolayev Com-mittee, among them two who had not previously been in Nikolayev and one who had already worked there before andpossessed numerous contacts. 
 It may be that at the momentof the arrests this third one was not in Nikolayev either. 
When the Central Committee’s candidates arrived in Ni-kolayev, they already found there two minority members who wanted to work, and agreed to admit them. 
 So the fact is that the three co-opted the two. 
 That is how it was. 
 Toverify it, inquiries can be made of the committee members,if they have not been arrested yet.... 
 ( Martov : “They already have.... 
”) According to our information, the facts are quite differ-ent from what has been represented, and to my way of think-ing the two majority members were right in acting asthey did. 
 The place where the candidates named by the Cen-tral Committee happen to be cannot serve as a reason for notadmitting them. 
 I again suggest passing a resolution to theeffect that in cases of complaints both sides shall be given a hearing. 
 As to the actual point at issue, I disagree with Comrade Martov’s resolution in principle. 
 The Central Com-mittee cannot be deprived of the right to appoint its owncandidates to the committees. 
 Of course, all authority isopen to abuse, but to combat that evil there is control—inthe form of the press, for example, or action by the Council, etc. 
 I join in the view that in the co-optation of new mem-bers the question of group distinctions should not be allowedto have any place. 
 I do not know so far of a single case of the Central Committee forcing anyone upon a committee. 
 All this talk of forcible appointment causes it to be very care-ful, and sheer tact restrains it from exercising its right. 
 III There are a few comments I want to make. 
 First of all I should like to point out that the claim that two of the candidates were sent to the Nikolayev Committee from Odes-sa or even by the Odessa Committee is based on some sortof misunderstanding. 
 Most likely there was a Central Com-mittee agent in Odessa, who duly took steps to re-establishthe Nikolayev Committee after the arrests. 
 At any rate weknow quite definitely that these three people were appoint-ed to it by the Central Committee, not anybody else. 
 I say this in passing, so as to remove any possible misunderstand-ings on this score. 
 Secondly, Comrade Martov’s statementthat he too does not know of a single case of the Central Com-mittee forcing its candidates on local committees is veryimportant, particularly as the editorial board, through its agents, has full information about what goes on in the Party. 
 As to the young woman who Comrade Martov says demand-ed to be co-opted to the Moscow Committee without a bal-lot, that example can hardly carry any weight, for we do notknow either the circumstances of the case or the extent ofher authorisation; and anyway, she was in fact admitted to the committee only after a ballot. 
 Thirdly, I also think it very important to note Comrade Martov’s remark that innormal conditions the Central Committee’s power of influenc-ing the composition of the local committees cannot be re-stricted. 
 It has been said here that people accuse the CentralCommittee of artificially “manufacturing” the committees; but then, accusations of a similar nature are not infrequently to be heard against the Central Organ. 
 And since, as acknowl-edged by Comrade Martov himself, there are in reality nosuch cases, and the whole thing comes down to no morethan the possibility of them, I don’t think that is a sufficient reason for restricting the Central Committee’s powers, par-ticularly as in practice the mere fact of such an approach will arouse a certain resentment. 
 I am quite ready to concurin Comrade Martov’s opinion that the two members of the Nikolayev Committee whom he speaks of are very valuable revolutionary workers—but then, they were , in point of fact, admitted to the committee. 
 In general, one may say that, precisely because of the various imputations that have been current recently, theCentral Committee has acted with the greatest circumspec-tion and has been in no haste to avail itself of its right toappoint new members to the local organisations. 
 And I have nothing against these cautious tactics being formally laid down for a time, by way of precluding and putting anend to false rumours about the Central Committee. 
 As regards our point about notifying the other side in cases of a complaint being lodged, I move the following reso-lution: “The Party Council requests Party organisations, in all cases of a complaint or inquiry being addressed to it by any part of an organisation, immediately and fully tonotify the other part of the organisation of the contents ofthat complaint or inquiry, for in order to settle disputesthe Party Council must have a statement of both sides ofthe case. 
 The same applies to complaints by one organisation against another. 
” 132 3 SPEECH ON THE NEWSPAPER RASSVET133 JUNE 5 (18) Unfortunately, there is not very much I can say in defence of Rassvet . 
 So far this experiment does have to be acknowl-edged not altogether successful. 
 Bonch-Bruyevich is not an experienced journalist and was entitled to expect help fromother Party writers. 
 This help was not forthcoming, andunder the circumstances it is not fair to put all the blame forthe failure on him alone. 
 It is only five months so far sincethe beginning of publication. 
 The paper may still get on its feet, particularly if other writers come to its aid. 
 Something has, after all, been accomplished: contacts among the sectsare broadening, both in America and in Russia. 
 It should alsobe mentioned that financially this publication does not taxthe Party’s resources, since it is financed out of other funds. 
I think closing it down would be premature and move that the experiment be continued. 
 WHAT WE ARE WORKING FOR (TO THE PARTY)134 A private meeting was recently held of nineteen members of the R. 
S.

P. 
 (among them Second Congress delegates, members of committees and other Party organisations, and revolutionaries not belonging to any Party organisation). 
This conference of persons who are at one in sharing the viewsof the Second Party Congress majority discussed our Partycrisis and ways and means of overcoming it, and decided toaddress the following appeal to all Russian Social-Demo-crats. 
 Comrades, the grave crisis in our Party is dragging on interminably. 
 The strife keeps growing, breeding disputeafter dispute, disastrously hampering positive work all alongthe line, and increasingly destroying the bond between theParty and its Central Organ, which has definitely become the organ of a circle and mainly an émigré circle at that. 
 That organ is manufacturing differences, ferreting out oldquestions that have long been settled and are a thing of thepast; it coquettes with the consistent opportunists and be-trays incredible confusion in its thinking; it shamelessly ig-nores the Party Congress, its debates and decisions, and mocks at Party organisation and discipline and at the major-ity of the revolutionaries who created the Party and aredoing the work on the spot; basing itself on unprovable allega-tions and unauthenticated anonymous reports, it carpinglyand maliciously crows over shortcomings in the work of thecommittees of the Party’s revolutionary wing. 
 That is what we are getting from the new Iskra , which has become a foun-tainhead of strife; that is what we are getting from the edito-rial board which the Congress rejected, and which has taken advantage of personal concessions to start new squabbles over co-optation and disrupt the Party. 
 Yet the historical juncture Russia is now passing through calls for the exertion of all our Party’s energies. 
 The revolu-tionary unrest among the working class and the fermentamong other sections of the population is growing apace;the war and crisis, starvation and unemployment are under-mining the foundations of the autocracy ever more deeply; a shameful end to the shameful war is not far off, and it is bound to heighten the revolutionary unrest still more, itwill bring the working class face to face with its enemies,and will require the most vigorous offensive action on thepart of the Social-Democrats. 
 A united Party organisation,a consistent revolutionary Marxist line, decent and digni-fied bounds to the internal struggle in the Party so as to pre-vent its becoming disruptive and hampering positive work—these are urgent demands of the entire working-class move-ment of Russia, and they must be satisfied immediately andat all costs, or the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Partywill risk completely forfeiting its good name and all the influence it has won. 
 The first step towards this end, in our opinion, is to estab-lish the fullest clarity, frankness, and outspokennessin the relations between the various groups, trends, andshades in our Party. 
 There are times, to be sure, when inthe interests of the work minor differences should be passed over in silence; but to think that the present is such a mo-ment in our Party’s life would be a most deplorable andunpardonable mistake. 
 Personal concessions to the minoritydid not check the strife, the disputed issues have now beenput point-blank, a direct challenge has been hurled at theentire Party, and only flabby and ignorant individuals can dream of bringing back the irrevocable past, of concealing, withholding, glossing over or shutting their eyes to anything. 
No, the policy of washing one’s hands, the policy of passiveabstention, the policy of laisser faire , laisser passer has alrea-dy proved its utter futility in our Party struggle. 
 Any fur-ther evasion, equivocation or concealment would be not only fruitless and contemptible, but downright criminal. 
 We are taking the initiative of making a frank and fullstatement of our programme of struggle within the Party; and we call on the representatives of each and every shade in the Russian Social-Democratic movement, whether already belonging to the Party or intending to join it under certain conditions, to do likewise. 
 Only complete clarity and frank-ness can furnish all class-conscious workers and all membersof the Party with the material for a rational and firm deci-sion of the disputed Party issues. 
 We uphold the standpoint of the Second Party Congress majority. 
 We consider that the erroneous position of the Congress minority, and their determination to persist in thisposition regardless of the will of the Party, was the primecause of all subsequent mistakes and of all the strife. 
 Theerror in that position was twofold: firstly, the old editorialcircle of Iskra could look for support to no one but the oppor-tunist wing of our Congress and our Party; secondly, this alliance with acknowledged opportunists (who were, and are,headed by Comrade Akimov) took final shape and became aParty division only over such an issue as the elections tothe central bodies. 
 From the first error there logically andinevitably followed all that confusion as to principle and all that opportunist wobbling which we find in the thinking of the new Iskra , insofar as that thinking can be considered to be based on principle at all. 
 From the second error followedtheir insistence on the old editorial circle against the willof the Party, their defence and justification of the circlespirit as against the party spirit, their employment in our controversies of methods only associated with philistine squabbling and circle wrangling, but certainly not witha struggle among Party members who respect their Party andthemselves. 
 From the first error it followed as a logical andinevitable consequence that those who rallied around theminority included all who tend towards opportunism, all who want to drag the Party back and be revenged for inju-ries done by the revolutionary Social-Democrats to theiropponents, all who express the intellectualist trend in ourmovement, all who incline towards the intellectual’s anar-chistic rejection of organisation and discipline. 
 Fromthe second error followed the supremacy of an émigré circle over the majority of the Party workers in Russia and the orgy of specifically émigré brawling which among the minor-ity takes the place of methods of persuasion. 
 There is no longer any room for doubt. 
 No one who is a Party member not only in name, no one who really wants to uphold the vital interests of our working-class movement, can hesitate now. 
 The minority have declared war and arefighting all along the line; and we accept the challenge anddeclare that the war will be relentless, a war to a finish. 
We are fighting against the circle spirit in general, and theold editorial circle in particular, on behalf of the party spirit. 
 We are fighting in the interests of the working-class movement in Russia against émigré squabbling. 
 We arefighting on behalf of the revolutionary proletarian trend inour movement against the opportunist intellectualist trend. 
We are fighting for the consistent revolutionary Social-Demo-cratic line against vacillation, zigzags, and reversions to the long-obsolete past. 
 We are fighting for a close-knit Party organisation of our working-class vanguard and againstintellectualist license, disorganisation, and anarchy. 
 We arefighting for respect for Party congresses and against spine-less veering about, against divergence of word and deed,against contempt for agreements and decisions adopted by common consent. 
 We are fighting for publicity in the Party as against the new Iskra ’s and the new Party Council’s tactics of keeping their minutes a secret and gagging themajority. 
 From our programme of struggle the methods and immedi-ate aims of that struggle follow of themselves. 
 The first meth-od is all-embracing agitation, spoken and written, on the widest possible scale. 
 This point would not be worth dwell-ing on were it not that the minority’s squabbling hasgiven rise in our Party to the notorious “conciliatory trend”(so justly ridiculed by the Ekaterinoslav Committee andmany other organisations), which hides its head under its wing and preaches that the majority should cease its struggle against the minority. 
 The existence of such childish views,unworthy of any adult Party member, can only be attributedto faint-heartedness, weariness, or remoteness from reality. 
One may and should demand that the party struggle be con-fined within party bounds, one may and should use other means besides exhortation to secure it; but the proposal to cease upholding what was upheld before the entire Party atthe Congress and what is deemed essential in the Party’s vital interests—such a proposal, if anyone dared to make it publicly, would only earn universal contempt. 
 The second, and decisive, means of struggle, in our opin-ion, is a Party congress. 
 We unreservedly support thosecommittees which demand that the Third Party Congressbe summoned immediately. 
 We consider it our duty, in par-ticular, to deal with the hypocritical arguments which theeditors of the new Iskra and their overt and covert abettors bring against a congress, while assiduously concealing these arguments (which are scarcely consistent with Party duty)from the eyes of the world (as is being done by the LeagueAbroad and the Iskra editors, whose agitation has only part-ly been brought into the open and exposed by the commit-tees). 
 First argument: a congress would lead to a split. 
 The very fact that the minority employ such an argument demon-strates the entire falsity of their position. 
 For in saying that,the minority admit that the Party is against them, that theirémigré circle has forced itself upon the Party and managesto maintain itself only because of the remoteness of Russiaand the external difficulties under which the real revolution-aries have to work. 
 Those who are honest towards the Party and sincerely anxious to work together will not fear a con-gress, but desire it, in order to put an end to the strife, bringthe Party and its official bodies into conformity, and removeunseemly ambiguity. 
 Those who hold up the bogey of a splitonly make it obvious that their consciences are not clear. 
 Without the subordination of minority to majority there can be no working-class party at all worthy of the name; and ifmutual (not one-sided) concessions are necessary, if arrange-ments and agreements between different parts of the Partyhave sometimes to be made, they are only possible and per-missible at a congress. 
 No self-respecting revolutionary will want to remain in a party that manages to hold together only because a party congress is artificially put off. 
 Second argument: a reconciliation is still possible without a congress. 
 What this opinion is based on is unknown. 
 Its pro-ponents talk and act only behind the scenes. 
 Is it not timeto abandon these back-stage intrigues, which only increase mutual distrust, intensify animosity, and obscure the situa-tion? Why is it that no one ventures to come forward publiclywith a plan of reconciliation?—is it not because, the posi- /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR tion being what it is, no such plan is conceivable which would not at best provoke laughter? Those who understand peace to mean the co-optation of minority favourites to the Central Committee do not want peace, but intensificationof the majority’s struggle; they fail to understand thatthe struggle in the Party has once and for all outgrown thelimits of a mere squabble over co-optation. 
 Those who un-derstand it to mean the cessation of controversy and struggle are reverting to the old circle mentality: there will always be controversy and struggle in a party, all that is necessaryis to confine them within Party bounds—and that only a con-gress can do. 
 In short, whichever way you turn this sloganof peace without a congress, however you revolve this ideaof reconciling the contending sides without satisfying either, you will find that this brilliant idea only reflects confusion and emptiness of mind, it is the idea of people who do notknow what they want and what they ought to strive for. 
If even the plan of so influential (formerly influential) aman as Plekhanov—to quench the fire at the very start bymaking the maximum personal concessions—suffered a com-plete fiasco, can one seriously speak of such plans now? Third argument: the congress may be manipulated. 
 The St. 
 Petersburg Committee has already replied to this ar-gument by calling it an insinuation. 
 135 And this statement by a local committee was a well-deserved slap in the face forthose who make sneaking charges without a shadow of fact to support them, although the minority control both the supreme Council and the press organ of the Party, so thatthey have not only the means of publicly exposing anysuspected abuses, but also the means of administrativecorrection and pressure. 
 Everyone knows that if there wereany such facts the minority would have trumpeted them forth long ago, and that the recent Council resolution, which shows that there have been no such facts in the past, rulesout their possibility in the future. 
 136 By resorting to this ar-gument Iskra only shows yet again that instead of controver-sy it now engages in fishwives’ abuse, and compels us to turnto all Party members and ask: Have we in fact a party? Do we want to follow the Socialist-Revolutionaries’ exam-ple and rest content with a facade and signboard, or is itnot rather our duty to tear down all shams? Fourth argument: the differences have not yet been clar-ified. 
 The best answer to that argument is supplied by the new Iskra itself, a study of which will show the Party that differences are being manufactured, not clarified, and thatthe confusion is growing endlessly. 
 Only a congress, at whichall comrades can openly and fully state their wishes, canbring clarity into these incredibly confused issues and thisconfused situation. 
 Fifth argument: a congress would divert forces and funds from positive work. 
 This argument, too, sounds like a dis-mal mockery, for no greater diversion of forces and fundscan be imagined than that which the strife is producing. 
 No, all the arguments against a congress testify either to hypocrisy or to ignorance of the position and pusillanimous doubts of the Party’s strength. 
 Our Party is again very sick, but it has strength enough to recover and become worthyof the Russian proletariat. 
 As the methods of cure we wouldrecommend the three following reforms, which we shall workfor by every available loyal means. 
 Firstly, the editorship of the Central Organ to be handed over to the adherents of the Second Party Congress majority. 
 Secondly, the local organisation abroad (the League) to be subordinated in fact to the all-Russia central organisation(the Central Committee). 
 Thirdly, the Rules to provide guarantees that Party strug-gles are conducted by Party methods. 
 Regarding these three fundamental points of our programme little remains to be added after what has already beensaid. 
 That the old editorial board of Iskra has now palpably demonstrated its unfitness, we consider incontrovertible. 
 Itis not Iskra -ism that has outlived its day, as Comrade Martov professed to discover after his defeat in the elections, but the old Iskra editorial board. 
 It would be sheer hypocrisy not to say that bluntly now, after the challenges this circle hasflung down to the entire Party. 
 On the abnormal positionof the organisation abroad, which has converted itselfinto a second (if not a third) leadership and completelyignores the Party’s Central Committee, there is no need to expatiate at length. 
 Lastly, the entire experience of the post-Congress struggle compels us to give thought to the juridicalposition of the minority (any minority) in our Party. 
 That experience shows, we are convinced, that it is necessary to include in the Party Rules guarantees of minority rights, so that the dissatisfactions, irritations and conflicts that will constantly and unavoidably arise may be diverted from theaccustomed philistine channels of rows and squabbling intothe still unaccustomed channels of a constitutional anddignified struggle for one’s convictions. 
 As one of theseessential guarantees, we propose that the minority be allowed one or more writers’ groups, with the right to be represent-ed at congresses and with complete “freedom of speech”. 
In general, the widest guarantees should be given as regardspublication of Party literature criticising the activitiesof the central Party institutions. 
 The committees should begiven the right to receive (through the general Party trans-port system) the particular Party publications they desire. 
 The Central Committee’s right to influence the personal com-position of the committees otherwise than by advice should,until the Fourth Congress, be suspended. 
 We do not hereelaborate our proposals in detail, for we are not compilingdraft Rules, but only a general programme of struggle. 
 We consider it highly important that the arrangements for pub-lication of minority literature which the Central Committeeproposed to the minority of the Second Congress should beincorporated in the Rules, in order that dissatisfaction mayfind seemly forms of expression, that the foolish fantasy ofa state of siege (invented by the heroes of co-optation) may be finally and completely dispelled, and that the inevitable internal struggles in the Party may not interfere with posi-tive work. 
 We must teach our minority to fight about the personal composition of the central bodies only at congresses, and nothamper our work after congresses by squabbling; we must achieve this if our Party is not to perish. 
 Lastly, in this general programme we shall only briefly mention certainspecific amendments we would wish to see made in the Rules,9, to wit: the conversion of the Council from a tripartite arbi-tration body into a body elected by the Congress amend-ment of Paragraph 1 of the Rules along the lines advocated by the Second Congress majority, with the inclusion among Party organisations of all workers’ organisations and allgroups of Russian Social-Democrats which had an indepen-dent existence during the circle period and which desire to join the Party, etc. 
, etc. 
 In putting forward this programme of our struggle within the Party, we invite all Party organisations and the rep-resentatives of all shades in the Party to make a statementof their own programmes, so as to permit of gradual, serious, circumspect, and judicious preparation for a congress. 
 We have no Party—the conspirators in our editorial palace coup said to themselves, banking on the remotenessof Russia, the frequent changes of workers there, and on their own indispensability. 
 Our Party is coming into being!— say we, seeing the committees awakening to active inter-vention, seeing the growing political understanding of theadvanced workers. 
 Our Party is coming into being; we haveever more numerous young forces capable both of reinvigo-rating and of replacing decrepit literary bodies; we have rev-olutionaries, and their number is steadily growing, who prize the trend of the old Iskra that schooled them above any editorial circle. 
 Our Party is coming into being, and nosubterfuges or delays, no senile malicious vituperation ofthe new Iskra can hold back the decided and final verdict of this Party. 
 From these new forces in our Party we derive our certainty of victory.

P. 
,137 persons who are at one in sharing the views of the Second Party Congress majority. 
 This con-ference discussed our Party crisis and ways and means ofovercoming it, and decided to address the following appealto all Social-Democrats of Russia: Comrades, the grave crisis in our Party life is dragging on and on, and no end is in sight. 
 The strife keeps growing, breeding dispute after dispute, and the Party’s positive work all along the line is hampered by it to the utmost. 
 Theenergies of the Party, still young and not yet consolidated,are being grievously dissipated. 
 Yet the present historical juncture makes vast demands on the Party, vaster than ever before. 
 The revolutionary unrest among the working class is growing, and so is the fer-ment among other sections of society; the war and crisis,starvation and unemployment are with elemental and in-evitable force undermining the foundations of the autocracy. 
A shameful end to the shameful war is not far off; and it isbound to heighten the revolutionary unrest still more, it is bound to bring the working class face to face with its ene-mies, and it will require of the Social-Democrats tremendouseffort, a colossal exertion of energy to organise the last deci-sive fight against the autocracy. 
 Is our Party equal to these demands in its present condi-tion? Every honest man will unhesitatingly answer: No! The unity of the Party has been deeply undermined, its internal struggle has gone beyond all party bounds. 
 Orga-nised discipline has been shaken to its very foundations, and the Party’s capacity for harmonious and united action is fading into a mere dream. 
 Nonetheless, we regard the Party’s sickness as a matter of growing pains. 
 We consider that the underlying cause of thecrisis is the transition from the circle form to party forms ofthe life of Social-Democracy; the essence of its internalstruggle is a conflict between the circle spirit and the partyspirit. 
 And, consequently, only by shaking off this sickness can our Party become a real party. 
 Under the name of the Party “minority” there have united a variety of elements who are linked by a conscious or un-conscious desire to preserve circle relationships, pre-partyforms of organisation. 
 Certain prominent figures in the more influential of the former circles, unaccustomed to the organisational self-limitations which Party discipline demands, are inclinedfrom force of habit to confuse their own circle interests withthe general Party interests, with which in the period ofthe circles they may in many cases indeed have coincided. 
A number of these people (part of the former Iskra editorial board, part of the former Organising Committee, the members of the former Yuzhny Rabochy group, and others) have been the leaders in a struggle on behalf of the circle spirit asagainst the party spirit. 
 Their allies proved to be all those elements who in theory or practice had deviated from the principles of strict Social-Democracy (the Economists, Rabocheye Dyelo -ists, etc. 
), for only the circle atmosphere could preserve the ideolog-ical individuality and the influence of these elements, where-as the Party atmosphere threatened to absorb them ordeprive them of all influence. 
 Lastly, the opposition cadreshave in general been drawn chiefly from those elements in our Party which consist primarily of intellectuals. 
 The intelli-gentsia is always more individualistic than the proletariat,owing to its very conditions of life and work, which do notdirectly involve a large-scale combination of efforts, do notdirectly educate it through organised collective labour. 
The intellectual elements therefore find it harder to adapt themselves to the discipline of Party life, and those of them who are not equal to it naturally raise the standard of revoltagainst the necessary organisational limitations, and elevate their instinctive anarchism to a principle of struggle, mis-naming it a desire for “autonomy”, a demand for “tolerance”, etc. 
 The section of the Party abroad, where the circles are comparatively long-lived, where theoreticians of variousshades are gathered, and where the intelligentsia decidedlypredominates, was bound to be most inclined to the views ofthe “minority”, which there as a result soon proved to be the actual majority. 
 Russia, on the other hand, where the voice of the organised proletarians is louder, where the Par-ty intelligentsia too, being in closer and more direct contactwith them, is trained in a more proletarian spirit, and wherethe exigencies of the immediate struggle make the need fororganised unity more strongly felt, came out in vigorous op-position to the circle spirit and the disruptive anarchistic tendencies. 
 It gave quite clear expression to this attitude innumerous statements by committees and other Party orga-nisations. 
 The struggle developed and grew increasingly acute. 
 And to what lengths has it not gone! The Party organ, of which the “minority” managed to seize control against the will of the Congress and thanksto personal concessions by the editors elected at the Con-gress, has become an organ of struggle against the Party! It is now least of all the ideological leader of the Party in its struggle against the autocracy and the bourgeoisie, and most of all the leader of circle opposition to the party spirit. 
 On the one hand, conscious that its fundamentalposition is indefensible from the standpoint of the Party’sinterests, it is busy searching out real and imaginary differ-ences to provide an ideological screen for that position; andin this search, seizing on one slogan one day and on another the next, it is turning more and more for its material to the Right wing of the Party—the former opponents of Iskra — and drawing ever closer to them ideologically, trying to re-habilitate their theories, which the Party has rejected, andto turn the Party’s ideological life back to what had alreadyseemed the bygone period of vagueness of principle-and ideological wavering and vacillation. 
 On the other hand, in an endeavour to undermine the moral influence of theParty majority, the new Iskra is even busier searching out and denouncing mistakes on the part of their adherents, magnifying every real slip to monstrous proportions and trying to lay the blame for it on the Party majority as a whole, and seizing on every insinuation and piece of circle gos-sip that could prove damaging to its opponents, often enoughnot even troubling about their verisimilitude, let aloneverifying their truth. 
 In this course the men of the new Iskra have gone so far as to impute to members of the majority absolutely non-existent and in fact impossible crimes—and not only of a political nature (as when they accuse theCentral Committee of forcibly ejecting individuals and break-ing up organisations), but even crimes against commonethics (as when prominent figures in the Party are accused offorgery or moral complicity in forgery). 
 Never before has the Party been immersed in such a sea of mud as the émigré minority have stirred up in the present controversy. 
 How could all this have happened?The mode of action of each of the sides corresponded to its fundamental trend. 
 The Party majority, anxious at allcosts to preserve the Party’s unity and organisational cohe-sion, fought only by loyal Party means, and more than once made concessions for the sake of reaching a reconciliation. 
The minority, following an anarchistic trend, showed noconcern for peace and unity in the Party. 
 They turnedevery concession into a weapon with which to continue thefight. 
 Of all the minority’s demands, only one has not now been met—that discord should be brought into the Party’s Central Committee by the co-optation of minority men forc-ibly foisted upon it; yet the attacks of the minority are morevicious than ever. 
 Having gained control of the Central Or-gan and the Party Council, the minority do not scruple toexploit in their circle interests the very discipline that they are in fact fighting. 
 The position has become intolerable, impossible; to allow it to drag on any longer would be a positive crime. 
 The first means of ending it, in our opinion, is complete clarity and frankness in Party relations. 
 Amidst all thismud and fog there is no finding the true path. 
 Every Party trend, every group must openly and definitely state what it thinks of the present position in the Party and whatsolution it desires. 
 And that is what we are proposing to all comrades, to the representatives of all shades in the Party. 
 The practical way out of the crisis, we consider, is the im-mediate summoning of the Third Party Congress. 
 It alone can clarify the situation, settle the disputes, and confine thestruggle within proper bounds. 
 Without a congress all we canexpect is the progressive disintegration of the Party. 
 All the arguments brought against a congress are, we main-tain, totally invalid. 
 We are told that a congress would lead to a split. 
 But why? If the minority are irreconcilable in their anarchistic lean-ings, if they are prepared to have a split rather than sub-mit to the Party, then they have already virtually secededfrom it, and to defer the inevitable formal split would bemore than irrational: chained together, both sides would more and more senselessly dissipate their strength in wran-gling and squabbling, exhausting themselves morally andgrowing ever pettier and shallower. 
 But we do not grant thepossibility of a split. 
 In face of the real strength of the orga-nised Party, the anarchistically minded elements are boundto, and we think will, bow in submission, for by their very nature they are incapable of constituting an independent force. 
 It is argued that a reconciliation is possible withouta congress. 
 But what sort of reconciliation? Total surrenderto the circle spirit, co-optation of the minority to the CentralCommittee, which would complete the disorganisation of thecentral institutions. 
 That would make the Party nothing but a name, and the Party majority would be compelled to start the struggle anew. 
 And the minority? They have used everyconcession hitherto won only as a buttress for their disrup-tive activities; even from their point of view, the struggle hasfar outgrown the bounds of a squabble over co-optation;how then can they discontinue it? And still less will they do so if they have not gained all their demands. 
 We are told that a congress will not achieve its purpose because the differ-ences have not yet been clarified. 
 But are they beingclarified now, is not the confusion growing worse con-founded? Differences are not being clarified, but deliber-ately searched out and manufactured, and only a con-gress can put an end to this. 
 It alone, by bringing the contending parties face to face and making them franklyand definitely state their objects, can thoroughly clarify the mutual relations between the different trends and forces in the Party. 
 But, the minority declare, the congress may be manipulated by the breaking up of organisations. 
 That is a lying insinuation, we reply, an insinuation unsupportedby a single fact. 
 If there were any such facts, we may be surethat the minority, being in possession of the Party organ,would have given them wide publicity, and, controlling theParty Council as they do, would have had ample opportunity to correct them. 
 Lastly, the recent Council resolution, which points to no such facts in the past, completely rules out theirpossibility in the future. 
 Who is now going to believe thisfar-fetched insinuation? Fears are expressed that a congresswould divert too much of our forces and funds from positivework. 
 What a bitter mockery! Can any greater diversion of forces and funds, be imagined than that which the strife is producing? A congress is imperative! It would be imperativeeven if Party life had proceeded normally, in view of the ex-ceptional historical juncture and the new tasks with whichthe world events may confront the Party. 
 It is doubly imper-ative in the present Party crisis, in order to find an honest and reasonable way out of it, to preserve the forces of the Par-ty and uphold its honour and dignity. 
 What must the Third Congress do to put an end to the strife and restore Party life to normal? Most essential forthis, in our view, are the following reforms, which weshall advocate and work for by every available loyal means: I. 
 The editorship of the Central Organ to be handed over to the adherents of the Party majority. 
 The need for this,in view of the manifest inability of the present editorialboard to conduct the Central Organ as required by the gen-eral Party interests, has been sufficiently demonstrated. 
 Theorgan of a circle cannot and must not be the organ of the Party. 
 II. 
 The relationship of the local organisation abroad (the League) to the all-Russia central body, the Central Commit-tee, to be clearly defined. 
 The present position of the League,which has converted itself into a second Party leader-ship and manages its associated groups without any control, completely ignoring the Central Committee, is obviously abnormal and must be ended. 
 III. 
 The Rules to provide guarantees that Party struggles are conducted by Party methods. 
 That this reform is essen-tial is shown by the entire experience of the post-Congress struggle. 
 It is necessary to include in the Party Rules guar-antees of the rights of any minority, so that the disagree-ments, dissatisfactions, and irritations that will constantlyand unavoidably arise may be diverted from the old, philis-tine, circle channels of rows and squabbling into the still unaccustomed channels of a constitutional and dignified struggle for one’s convictions. 
 Among the conditions neededfor such a change we class the following. 
 The minority shouldbe allowed one or more writers’ groups, with the right to berepresented at congresses; the widest formal guaranteesshould be given as regards publication of Party literature criticising the activities of the central Party institutions. 
 The right of the committees to receive (through the generalParty transport system) the particular Party publicationsthey desire should be formally recognised. 
 The limits ofthe Central Committee’s right to influence the personal com-position of the committees should be precisely defined. 
 We consider it highly important that the arrangements for publication of minority literature which the CentralCommittee proposed to the minority of the Second Congressshould be incorporated in the Rules, in order that thefantasy of a “state of siege” invented by the minority them-selves may be dispelled, and that the inevitable internal struggles in the Party may be conducted in seemly forms and not allowed to interfere with positive work. 
 We do not here elaborate our proposals in detail, for we are not putting forward draft Rules, but only a generalprogramme of struggle for Party unity. 
 We shall thereforeonly briefly indicate certain specific amendments to the Rules which are in our opinion desirable, without in any way binding ourselves as regards subsequent elaboration ofthe Rules, in the light of further experience. 
 For example,it is necessary to reform the Party Council, as an institutionwhich, in its present form, has proved in practice to be unfitfor its function of co-ordinating and exercising supreme su-pervision over the activities of the central bodies. 
 It should be made a body entirely elected by the Congress, instead ofbeing a court where the Congress-elected fifth member sits as arbiter over the central bodies, which defend themselves through their delegates. 
 Further, Paragraph 1 of the Rules should be revised, in line with the criticisms voiced in the Party, to define the Party’s boundaries more precisely, etc. 
 In putting forward this programme of struggle for Party unity, we invite the representatives of all other shades andall Party organisations to make a clear statement of theirown programmes, so as to permit of serious and system-atic, conscious and methodical preparation for a congress. 
 An issue involving the very life, the honour and dignityof the Party is at stake: is it an ideological and materialforce capable of sufficient rational self-organisation to actas the real leader of our country’s revolutionary working-class movement? By all their actions, the émigré minority answer: No! And they continue to act in this way with con-fident assurance, banking on the remoteness of Russia,the frequent changes of workers there, and the indispensabil-ity of their own leaders and literary forces. 
 Our Party iscoming into being!—we answer, seeing the growing politicalunderstanding of the advanced workers, the vigorous activity of the committees in general Party life. 
 Our Party is coming into being, we have ever more numerous young forces capableof replacing or reinvigorating old literary bodies whichforfeit the Party’s confidence; we have ever more revolution-aries who prize the consistent Party trend above any circleof former leaders. 
 Our Party is coming into being, and no subterfuges or delays can hold back its decided and final verdict. 
 From these forces in our Party we derive our certainty of victory.

, Glebov, Konyagin,138 Travinsky, Loshad, and Osipov. 
 I was informed today, through the Central Committee’s Berlin agent, of the decisions taken by four (?) members ofthe Central Committee at their meeting in Russia. 
 139 I can-not acknowledge these decisions lawfully adopted, for the following reasons: 1) The statement at the beginning of the resolution that the meeting was attended by all Central Committee mem-bers but one (that is, myself) is not true . 
 After the arrest of Vasilyev and Zverev and the resignation of Mitrofanov, 140 the Central Committee still has another member—ComradeOsipov. 
 The rumours of his resignation have proved false:Comrade Osipov himself considers that he is a member ofthe Central Committee. 
 That was also the view of Vasilyev(who wrote to me about it), Zverev, and myself. 
 In any case,the four Central Committee members had no right to declare Osipov no longer a member without first clarifying the matter of his alleged resignation. 
 It has to be added that neither Inor the Central Organ nor any of the Central Committee’sforeign agents was ever formally notified of Osipov’s resigna-tion. 
 Yet Osipov was not invited to the meeting. 
 2) I too, so far from being invited to the meeting, was not even informed of it or notified of the matters to be discussed. 
 The Central Committee has of course the right to decide mat-ters by a majority vote, but its decisions cannot be lawful unless all members have been given the opportunity to share in the proceedings and, if necessary, enter a dissenting opinion. 
 I was denied that opportunity altogether unlawfully . 
 3) The four Central Committee members have not stated their attitude to the agreement of May 26, 1904, betweenGlebov and myself, although that agreement and my accom-panying letter were, with Glebov and Zverev’s consent, sentto all members of the Central Committee with the request to give me a direct answer. 
 The majority on the Central Commit-tee are fully entitled to overrule the minority, but certainlynot to evade official inquiries by the minority and issuesexpressly raised by the minority for discussion. 
 4) In view of the above I demand an immediate answer from the four Central Committee members to the following: a) on what grounds was Comrade Osipov, a member of the Central Committee, not invited to the meeting? b) ditto asregards myself; c) do they recognise that the majority ofa body has the right to adopt decisions in the name of thebody as a whole only if the minority has been invited to theproceedings and given the opportunity to state its views and enter a dissenting opinion? d) do they recognise their obligation to give an answer on the substance of all theissues raised in the agreement of May 26, 1904? 5) Since the four Central Committee members have commu-nicated their unlawfully adopted decisions (as supposeddecisions of the whole Central Committee) to the Central Organ, I am obliged to address a letter regarding their mode of procedure to Party workers whom this matter rather close-ly concerns.

 SIDING WITH THE SECOND PARTY CONGRESS MAJORITY Comrades, The conflict within the Central Committee has reached such a pitch that I consider myself morally obliged tobring it to the knowledge of all who support the Second PartyCongress majority. 
 I am compelled to do so both by the un-lawful proceedings of four members of the Central Committee and by the fear of again taking some incautious step harm-ful to the Party (such as my resignation from the editorialboard) unless I consult like-minded comrades who are work-ing on the spot, who have a better knowledge of the realsentiment in the Party, and who have in fact, and not mere-ly in word, declared war on the old émigré circle spirit in the name of the young party spirit. 
 What the conflict within the Central Committee consists in will be seen from the four appended documents: 1) theagreement of May 26, 1904, between three Central Commit-tee members—Glebov, Zverev, and Lenin; 2) my letter ofthe same date to the members of the Central Committee; 3) a resolution allegedly adopted by all members of the Central Committee but one; 4) my protest impeaching thelawfulness of this alleged resolution. 
 141 I would earnestly request all like-minded comrades in the present struggle in the Party to read these instructive docu-ments carefully, and frankly and unreservedly state their opinion concerning them. 
 I for my part shall refrain from any public statement in the press on these issues, at leastfor a time, until I know the views of some of those working in Russia, or until compelled to such a statement by events. 
 I shall confine myself here to a few questions to the Party, if the members of our organisations find that we do in fact have a party: 1) can a working-class party worthy of thename tolerate a Central Committee, elected by the major-ity, that proclaims the policy of the majority to be a “group”policy? 2) are people morally entitled to our confidence whoin a declaration written in March say one thing and in July quite another?—3) people who take advantage of the arrest of two majority members of the Central Committee to tram-ple on the interests of the majority?—4) people who in thename of combating group policies talk of a conference withthe minority group, ignoring the majority?—5) people whoare afraid of having their actions judged by a congress, and for that reason dare to intimidate the Party with the prospect of a split and to “forbid” Party members their ele-mentary right of agitating for a congress?—6) people sochildishly incapable of understanding our Party crisis thatthey insist in all seriousness on the “legitimacy” of the Cen-tral Organ and decree the “ high standard ” of that Central Organ?—7) people who, in deliberate defiance of the will of the Party, try to oust consistent adherents of the Party major-ity from the Central Committee? I conclude with the request for an answer to these questions and for steps to be taken to acquaint all active Party mem-bers with the situation and with this letter. 
 I don’t think there is any necessity for the present of publishing the letter. 
 Central Committee member N. 
 Lenin Written on August 5 (18), 1904 First published in 1930 Published according in Lenin Miscellany XV to the manuscript LETTER TO GLEBOV (V. 
 A. 
 NOSKOV) September 11, 1904 Dear Comrade, You again repeat that the wish that I join the editorial board of the Central Organ was expressed “by the Central Committee”. 
 And I for my part must repeat that this is, tosay the least, inaccurate. 
 When you formally stated that theCentral Committee’s declaration had been adopted unani-mously by a meeting of all its members but one, I repliedimmediately (August 18, 1904) that this was not true. 
 The declaration was signed by three Central Committee mem-bers 142 out of the recent total of nine; and these three quite unlawfully proclaimed Comrade Osipov no longer a memberof the Central Committee, whereas he informed me in writingthat he still considered himself a member. 
 It was unlawfulto declare that a comrade had resigned without having dis-cussed the matter with him. 
 Both the arguments with which you and your two colleagues tried to justify this unlawfulact are patently unsound. 
 You said that Comrade Osipovhad formally announced his resignation at the precedingregular meeting of the Central Committee. 
 That is not true,for at the end of May (that is, months after that meeting, which took place in February or March) the Central Commit-tee still counted nine members, as is certified by the agree-ment of May 26, 1904, signed by three members of the CentralCommittee, and the letter appended to that agreement. 
 * You said that after that Central Committee meeting ComradeOsipov had joined one of the local committees, which a mem-ber of the Central Committee would have had no right to do. 
 *See pp. 
 424-27 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 Comrade Osipov had already written to me on this point, stating that he had gone to take part in the local work in the district in question on the instructions of those very members of the Central Committee who now declare that he has re-signed, and that he had not worked as a formal member of thecommittee. 
 Besides, even if it were a fact that a member ofthe Central Committee had irregularly and in contraventionof the Rules joined a local committee, it does not at all fol-low that to correct this irregularity he had necessarily to resign from the Central Committee, and not from the localcommittee. 
 Lastly, you yourself had to admit in your let-ter to me that the meeting of the three Central Committeemembers was informed that Comrade Osipov’s resignationwas a disputed matter. 
 That this disputed matter should have been decided by three Central Committee members in the absence of Osipov, and without even hearing his opinion,was a patent and outrageous piece of lawlessness. 
 Of course,the three Central Committee members could count on thesupport of the Party Council, which is controlled by the edi-tors; of course, the three Central Committee members could rely on their formal or tacit compact with the minority adherents on the Council. 
 But that does not make their actionlawful; on the contrary, it aggravates its unlawfulnessby elements of political bad faith. 
 Similarly, it was unlaw-ful for the three Central Committee members to accept theresignation of Comrade Travinsky, of which all members of the Central Committee had not been informed prior to the meeting. 
 To this day you have not been able to tell meexactly when this resignation was tendered, and to whom. 
You disposed of the matter with a reply that sounded like asneer: “Make inquiries of the collegium in Russia”—thatis, the “collegium” (that very same collegium of three!) from which you had just come and with which I have no means of communicating except through you!! Hence, I challenge the lawfulness of the composition of the Central Committee and of its last meeting (at whichthe “declaration” was adopted). 
 I should therefore be fullyentitled to leave unanswered your proposal that I join the editorial board of the Central Organ. 
 But I regard this pro-posal as coming not from the Central Committee but fromthree members of the Party, and consider it my duty to give a reasoned reply, the more so since you say it is the wish of the editors of the Central Organ, stated to you in writing, to have me on the editorial board. 
 You suggest that my joining the editorial board of the Central Organ “would secure almost complete peace in theParty, which you are so anxious to have”. 
 This “almost”of yours is highly significant! Yes, I am anxious to havepeace in the Party. 
 I made an offer of peace in printed form in December 1903, in my “Letter to the Editors of Iskra (Why I Resigned from the Editorial Board)”. 
 * I made another offer of peace, officially, in the Party Council in January1904. 
 ** Peace was not accepted on the terms I offered then on behalf of the majority. 
 I may remark that, contrary tothe present fashion of mouthing hypocritical phrases about “peace”, when by peace is meant complete surrender to the minority, complete ignoring of the majority, and completeoblivion of the Congress, I said quite definitely in the Coun-cil what I understood by peace in the Party. 
 With my thenfellow delegate from the Central Committee on the Council,I plainly stated that by peace I meant purging the ideological struggle of all contention over post and place, of all squab-bling and underhand methods of fighting. 
 Let the minorityhave the Central Organ and the majority the Central Com-mittee I proposed then, let us call on everyone to stop allboycotts and all squabbling over posts and co-optation andargue out our differences and the causes of our divergence at the Congress in a comradely manner, let us train the Party to discuss its internal disagreements in an honest and digni-fied way. 
 My appeal was ridiculed by Plekhanov and Martov. 
I am not surprised that they took the disgraceful decision towithhold publication of the Council minutes (in spite of theinsistence of the minority of the Council, namely, the two representatives of the Central Committee), or that the three Central Committee members have now (clandestinely) endorsedthat decision. 
 People who would arrange a hypocriticalpeace, taking advantage of the accidents unavoidable in thelives of Russian revolutionaries and ousting from the Cen-tral Committee those who think differently from them-*See pp. 
 118-24 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 **See pp. 
 145-47 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 selves, * are bound to want to conceal from the Party member-ship a timely attempt to achieve an honest peace. 
 Fortu-nately, I have reason to believe that this miserable trick to deceive the Party will not succeed and that the Councilminutes will see the light after all. 
 When the editors who had usurped control of the Council scornfully rejected my offer of peace, I declared then andthere that I considered a congress the only honest way out. 
 The tactics of the minority (including Plekhanov)—to keep control of the editorial board of the Central Organ andthe Council and claim to represent on these central bodiesthe interests of the Party as a whole while in fact trying tosecure, without a congress, a remodelling of the CentralCommittee in the interests of the minority—such tactics I cannot regard as honest fighting. 
 I have never entered, and do not deem it possible to enter, into any bargains with peo-ple who follow such tactics. 
 Besides, since January the com-plexion of the new Iskra has become quite clear; it is a cen-tral organ of tittle-tattle and squabbling, of muddled think-ing and of flirting with the opportunists, of settling perso-nal scores and searching out points of difference. 
 That the new Iskra is the organ of a circle, the organ of a new “trend”, is now clear to everyone, even to the editors themselves, whoinitially set themselves up as champions of “continuity”and now systematically drag the old Iskra through the mire. 
 And so, in what sense can one now speak of peace? If by peace is meant purging the ideological struggle of squabbles over co-optation, I am still quite ready to agree to peace andto renew the proposal I made in the Council. 
 But if by peaceis meant cessation of the ideological struggle, conciliationwith the line, or rather with the complexion of the new Iskra , for it has no such thing as a line, then such a “peace” can only be proposed by unprincipled or hypocritical people, or by people for whom the organs of the Party are so much news-print ( Druckerschwärze , printer’s ink, as one of the “concilia-tors” called the writings of the new Iskra ). 
 If the editors of the new Iskra , whose position of “principle” has amounted almost *This applies in the first place to Comrade Osipov, and secondly to me too, of course, for to propose that I join the editorial board ofthe Central Organ amounts to proposing that I resign from the Cen-tral Committee. 
 entirely to personal attacks on me, to a hue and cry against what they have dubbed “Leninism”, and to a searching out of differences with me, now express the wish to have me on the editorial board, they are only admitting thereby that theydo not take their own writings seriously, that they inventedthe whole controversy just “for the sake of co-optation” andare prepared to throw all their new “principles” overboardonce co-optation has been secured. 
 As for me, I reject as, unworthy the very suggestion that the majority could give up a Party struggle for its position, for the consistent line,against the circle spirit. 
 In common with all principled sup-porters of the majority, whose numbers in Russia are growing,I consider it my inalienable right and duty to carry on thisstruggle. 
 And it should, in my view, be carried on openly, for nine-tenths of the history of the conflict is already public knowledge and any further attempts to conceal it from theeyes of the world would only be a petty and senseless prolong-ing of the crisis. 
 You write that “numerous committees, too, undoubtedly wish” to see me join the present Iskra editorial board. 
 I note with regret that here too you are uttering a deliberate untruth. 
 In the present circumstances of the struggle, notone committee has up to now expressed any such wish. 
 Ithas only been expressed by the editorial circle of the CentralOrgan and by three members of the Central Committee, whoconsider it the acme of political wisdom to join the minority in abusing the majority and the majority in abusing the minority. 
 I make bold to believe that my duty is to heed, notthe will of any group of politicians, but the will of the entireParty, which has also laid down the method of giving formalexpression to that will, viz. 
, the congress. 
 I make bold tobelieve that a leader who adopts a certain line at the con-gress and leads a section of the Party along that line forfeits every claim to respect or even to having his words takenseriously if he then deserts to the side of his oppo-nents. 
 Your reference to “numerous committees” is very instruc-tive and significant, in spite of its ... divergence from the truth. 
 It points to a shred of Party conscience, to some little recognition of the fact that official institutions appointedby the Party must take cognisance of the Party’s will when they undertake to revise the composition and line of the cen-tral bodies. 
 If this recognition were not obscured in you by the confused position you have adopted, you would have no difficulty in seeing that there is no other way of really ascer-taining the real wishes of really numerous committees thanby convening a congress. 
 But while your reference to “nu-merous committees” betrays a shred of Party conscience, italso points very clearly to an uneasy conscience. 
 You fear a congress like the plague because you realise that your policy of adventures glaringly conflicts with the will of theParty. 
 My general views as to the hypocrisy of your peace-making are fully borne out by a number of additional facts. 
 Thethree Central Committee members now admire the “high standard” of the Central Organ, while in March these very same three members of the Central Committee drew up a state-ment expressing regret that certain Party writers (themajority of the present editorial board of the Central Organ)should have lapsed into opportunism. 
 While talking about“peace”, these three Central Committee members dissolve the Southern Bureau (an agent body of the Central Committee) because majority adherents have been working on it and havehad the audacity to agitate for a congress. 
 While talkingabout reconciling the two contending sides, the three Cen-tral Committee members arrange a conference with represen-tatives of one side, ignoring the other. 
 What demoralisation is brought into the Party by these private, hole-and-corner transactions, which affect the whole Party’s vital interestsand which are so carefully kept from its knowledge, whenthere is absolutely no necessity for secrecy precautions!How much mutual distrust and suspicion is brought intothe Party’s whole life by these tricks behind the back of the Party! Only today I received a letter from a comrade in Russia describing the rumours that are circulating in connec-tion with these transactions: it is said in Party circles thatthree sections have developed among the minority; one in-sists on the co-optation of Dan and Trotsky to the CentralCommittee, and will not hear of anything else; the second agrees to a conference; the third contents itself with the Central Committee’s declaration, and this section includesthe Yuzhny Rabochy -ists (who quite rightly interpret the starting of a popular organ as nothing but a masked re-estab-lishment of Yuzhny Rabochy , which the Congress closed down). 
 I do not know what truth there is in this Party gossip. 
 But that the minority consists of heterogeneous groups, thatComrade Brouckère, for example, probably takes no part atall in the minority’s “ultimatums” or the co-optation squab-ble generally, and that the Yuzhny Rabochy group represents quite a distinct shade—these are all generally known facts, with which everyone who has studied our Party Congress is familiar. 
 Can you really not see how degrading is all thishuckstering of various groups behind the back of the Party?Is it surprising that the hypocrisy of the three Central Com-mittee members is earning them the utter distrust of themajority, which stands aloof from all this trickery? Is it surprising that a “peace” inaugurated by dismissing people who agitate for a congress should be regarded as a prelude tothe systematic faking of Party opinion? Is it surprising thatthe majority should suspect a deal between the Central Com-mittee and the Central Organ (and, consequently, the Coun-cil) to force minority adherents upon the committees, to withhold publication of majority resolutions (the St. 
 Peters-burg and Ekaterinoslav resolutions have been withheld for months already ), etc. 
, etc. 
? I hope you will now understand why, with the present situation in the Party, there can be no thought of my joiningthe editorial board of the Central Organ. 
 Your statement that I “abstained” from voting on the co-optation of three new members to the Central Committeeis not true . 
 I emphatically protest against considering “the elections as valid”. 
 This is another piece of lawlessness. 
 It is the duty of all three Central Committee members to con-sider my protest, and only after that can they raise the ques-tion of co-optation. 
 According to the Rules, co-optationmust be unanimous; my consent has not been given. 
 Conse-quently, without the matter being taken to the Council there can be no talk of the co-optation being valid. 
 The decision of the Council (if you unlawfully take the co-optation issue there before a scrutiny of the composition of the Central Committee has been made by all its members) must be sent to me together with the Council minutes. 
 I cannot share your regret at our not having met. 
 After your tricks with regard to Comrade Osipov and your attitudeto your pledged word (agreement of May 26, 1904), I do notwish to have anything to do with you except in a purely official way, and only in writing.

 Shakhov, Geneva, 1904 ONE STEP FORWARD, TWO STEPS BACK REPLY BY N. 
 LENIN TO ROSA LUXEMBURG143 Comrade Rosa Luxemburg’s article in Nos. 
 42 and 43 of the Neue Zeit is a criticism of my Russian book on the crisis in our Party. 
 * I cannot but thank our German com-rades for their attention to our Party literature and their attempts to acquaint German Social-Democrats with it,but I must point out that Rosa Luxemburg’s Neue Zeit article does not acquaint the reader with my book, but withsomething else. 
 This may be seen from the following instances. 
Comrade Luxemburg says, for example, that my book is a clear and detailed expression of the point of view of “intransigent centralism”. 
 Comrade Luxemburg thus supposesthat I defend one system of organisation against another. 
But actually that is not so. 
 From the first to the last pageof my book, I defend the elementary principles of any con-ceivable system of party organisation. 
 My book is not con-cerned with the difference between one system of organi-sation and another, but with how any system is to be main-tained, criticised, and rectified in a manner consistent withthe party idea. 
 Rosa Luxemburg further says that “accord-ing to his [Lenin’s] conception, the Central Committee hasthe right to organise all the local Party committees”. 
 Actual-ly that is not so. 
 What my views on this subject are can be documentarily proved by the draft Rules of Party Organisationwhich I proposed. 
 In that draft there is nothing about anyright to organise the local committees. 
 That right was intro-duced into the Party Rules by the commission elected by theParty Congress to frame them, and the Congress adopted *One Step Forward , Two Steps Back —pp. 
 203-425 of this vo-lume. 
—Ed. 
 the commission’s text. 
 But besides myself and one other majority adherent, the commission included three members of the Congress minority, so that in this commission which gave the Central Committee the right to organise the localcommittees, it was my opponents that had the upper hand. 
Comrade Luxemburg has confused two different things. 
 Inthe first place, she has confused my organisational draftwith the modified draft of the commission and with the Rules of Organisation as actually adopted by the Congress; secondly, she has confused the defence of a specific pointrelating to a specific clause of the Rules (in that defenceI was by no means intransigent, for I did not object at theplenary session to the amendment made by the commission)with the defence of the thesis (truly “ultra-centralist”, is it not?) that Rules adopted by a Party congress must be adhered to until amended by a subsequent congress. 
 Thisthesis (a “purely Blanquist” one, as the reader may readilyobserve) I did indeed defend in my book quite “intransi-gently”. 
 Comrade Luxemburg says that in my view “theCentral Committee is the only active nucleus of the Party”. 
 Actually that is not so. 
 I have never advocated any such view. 
 On the contrary, my opponents (the Second Party Congressminority) charged in their writings that I did not sufficientlyuphold the independence of the Central Committee, thatI made it too subordinate to the editorial board of the Cen-tral Organ and the Party Council, bodies located abroad. 
 To these charges I replied in my book that when the Party majority had the upper hand in the Party Council, the lat-ter never made any attempt to interfere with the CentralCommittee’s independence, but that when the Party councilbecame a weapon of the minority, this did immediately hap-pen. 
 Comrade Rosa Luxemburg says that there are no two opinions among the Russian Social-Democrats as to the need for a united party, and that the whole controversy is overthe degree of centralisation. 
 Actually that is not so. 
 IfComrade Luxemburg had taken the trouble to acquaint her-self with the resolutions of the many local Party committeesthat constitute the majority, she would readily have seen (which incidentally is also clear from my book) that our con-troversy has principally been over whether the Central Com-mittee and Central Organ should represent the trend of the majority of the Party Congress, or whether they should not. 
 About this “ultra-centralist” and “purely Blanquist” demand the worthy comrade says not a word, she prefers to declaim against mechanical subordination of the part to thewhole, against slavish submission, blind obedience, and othersuch bogeys. 
 I am very grateful to Comrade Luxemburg forexplaining the profound idea that slavish submission is veryharmful to the Party, but I should like to know: does the com-rade consider it normal for supposed party central institu-tions to be dominated by the minority of the Party Congress?—can she imagine such a thing?—has she ever seen itin any party? Comrade Luxemburg fathers on me the ideathat all the conditions already exist in Russia for forminga large and extremely centralised workers’ party. 
 Again an error of fact. 
 Nowhere in my book did I voice such an idea, let alone advocate it. 
 The thesis I advanced expressedand expresses something else: I insisted, namely, that allthe conditions already existed for expecting Party Con-gress decisions to be observed, and that the time was pastwhen a Party institution could be supplanted by a private circle. 
 I brought proof that certain academics in our Party had shown themselves inconsistent and unstable, and thatthey had no right to lay the blame for their own lack ofdiscipline upon the Russian proletarians. 
 The Russian work-ers have already pronounced repeatedly, on various occa-sions, for observance of the Party Congress decisions. 
 It is nothing short of laughable when Comrade Luxemburg pro-claims such a view “optimistic” (should it not rather be con-sidered “pessimistic”?) without uttering a single word aboutthe factual basis of my thesis. 
 Comrade Luxemburg declaresthat I glorify the educational influence of the factory. 
 Thatis not so. 
 It was my opponent, not I, who said that I pictured the Party as a factory. 
 I properly ridiculed him and proved with his own words that he confused two different aspects offactory discipline, which, unfortunately, is the case withComrade Luxemburg too. 
 * Comrade Luxemburg says that I characterised my stand-point more acutely, perhaps, than any of my opponents could *Cf. 
 the Russian pamphlet Our Misunderstandings , the article “Rosa Luxemburg vs. 
 Karl Marx”. 
 have done when I defined a revolutionary Social-Democrat as a Jacobin who has identified himself with the organisation of the class-conscious workers. 
 Yet another error of fact. 
 It was P. 
 Axelrod, not I, who first started talking about Jaco-binism. 
 He was the first to liken our Party trends to thoseof the days of the great French Revolution. 
 I merely observedthat the parallel could only be allowed in the sense thatthe division of present-day Social-Democracy into a revolu-tionary and an opportunist wing corresponded to some extent to the division into Montagnards and Girondists. 
 The oldIskra , which the Party Congress endorsed, often drew such a parallel. 
 Just because it recognised this division, the oldIskra fought against the opportunist wing in our Party, against the Rabocheye Dyelo trend. 
 Rosa Luxemburg here confuses comparison of the two revolutionary trends of the eighteenth and the twentieth century with identification ofthose trends. 
 If I say, for example, that the Jungfrau standsin the same relation to the Little Scheidegg as a house of fourstoreys to one of two, that does not mean I identify a four-storey house with the Jungfrau. 
 Comrade Luxemxburg leaves completely out of sight the factual analysis of the different trends in our Party. 
 Yet the greater half of my book is devotedprecisely to this analysis, based on the minutes of ourParty Congress, and in the preface I call special attention tothe fact. 
 Rosa Luxemburg sets out to talk about the presentposition in our Party while totally ignoring our Congress, which was what really laid our Party’s foundation. 
 A rash enterprise, it has to be said! Particularly since I point outa hundred times in my book that my opponents ignore ourParty Congress and by so doing leave all their assertions de-void of all foundation of fact. 
 Comrade Luxemburg commits exactly the same basic error. 
 She repeats naked words without troubling to grasp their concrete meaning. 
 She raises bogeys without informing her-self of the actual issue in the controversy. 
 She puts in mymouth commonplaces, general principles and conceptions,absolute truths, and tries to pass over the relative truths,pertaining to perfectly definite facts, with which alone I operate. 
 And then she rails against set formulas and in-vokes the dialectics of Marx! It is the worthy comrade’s ownarticle that consists of nothing but manufactured formulas and runs counter to the ABC of dialectics. 
 This ABC tells us that there is no such thing as abstract truth, truth is always concrete. 
 Comrade Rosa Luxemburg loftily ignores the concrete facts of our Party struggle and engages in gran-diloquent declamation about matters which it is impossibleto discuss seriously. 
 Let me cite one last example from Com-rade Luxemburg’s second article. 
 She quotes my remarkthat the way the Rules of Organisation are formulated can make them a more or a less trenchant weapon against oppor-tunism. 
 * Just what formulations I talked about in my book and all of us talked about at the Congress, of that she doesnot say a word. 
 What the controversy at the Party Congresswas, and against whom I advanced my theses, she does nottouch on in the slightest. 
 Instead, she favours me with a whole lecture on opportunism ... in the parliamentary countries!! But about the peculiar, specific varieties of opportunism inRussia, the shades which it has taken on there and withwhich my book is concerned, we find not a word in her article. 
The upshot of all these very brilliant arguments is: “PartyRules are not meant in themselves [?? understand this who can!] to be a weapon of resistance to opportunism, but only an outward instrument for exerting the dominant influenceof the actually existing revolutionary-proletarian majorityof the Party. 
” Quite so. 
 But how this actually existing major-ity of our Party was formed Rosa Luxemburg does not say,yet that is exactly what I talk about in my book. 
 Nor does she say what influence it was that Plekhanov and I defended with the help of this outward instrument. 
 I can only add thatnever and nowhere have I talked such nonsense as that theParty Rules are a weapon “in themselves”. 
 The best way to answer this kind of presentation of my views will be to set forth the concrete facts of our Party struggle. 
 Anyone will then be able to see how ill Comrade Luxemburg’s abstract commonplaces and formulas sort with the concretefacts. 
 Our Party was founded in Russia in the spring of 1898 at a congress of representatives of several Russian organisations. 
It was named the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, *See p. 
 273 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 Rabochaya Gazeta144 was made the Central Organ, and the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad became the Party’s foreign representative. 
 Very soon after the congress, the Central Committee of the Party was arrested. 
 Rabochaya Gazeta had to cease publication after its second issue. 
 The whole Party became a shapeless conglomeration of localParty organisations (known as committees). 
 The only bondbetween these local committees was an ideological, purely spiritual one. 
 A period of disunity, vacillation, and splits was bound to set in again. 
 The intellectuals, who in our Partymade up a much larger percentage than in the West-Euro-pean parties, had taken up Marxism as a new vogue. 
 Thisvogue very soon gave place to slavish acceptance of the bour-geois criticism of Marx, on the one hand, and an infatu-ation for a purely trade-unionist labour movement (strike-ism—Economism), on the other. 
 The divergence between theintellectual-opportunist and proletarian revolutionary trendsled to a split in the Union Abroad. 
 The newspaper Rabo-chaya Mysl , and the Rabocheye Dyelo magazine published abroad, expressed (the latter in somewhat lesser degree) the standpoint of Economism, they belittled the importance of political struggle and denied the existence of a bourgeois-democratic element in Russia. 
 The “legal” critics of Marx—Messrs. 
 Struve, Tugan-Baranovsky, Bulgakov, Berdyaev,and the rest—swung all the way to the Right. 
 Nowhere inEurope do we find Bernsteinism arriving so speedily at its logical consummation—the formation of a liberal group—as was the case in Russia. 
 There, Mr. 
 Struve began with “criti-cism” in the name of Bernsteinism and ended by setting upthe liberal magazine Osvobozhdeniye , liberal in the European sense of the term. 
 Plekhanov and his friends, who broke awayfrom the Union Abroad, met with support from the founders of Iskra and Zarya . 
 These two publications waged (even Com-rade Luxemburg has heard something about that) a “bril-liant three-year campaign” against the opportunist wing ofthe Party, a campaign of the Social-Democratic “Mountain”against the Social-Democratic “Gironde” (the expression be-longs to the old Iskra ), a campaign against Rabocheye Dyelo (Comrades Krichevsky, Akimov, Martynov, and others), against the Jewish Bund, against the organisations in Russiathat eagerly espoused this trend (notably the St. 
 Petersburg so-called Workers’ Organisation and the Voronezh Commit-tee). 
 It became more and more obvious that the purely ideolog-ical bond between the committees was not enough. 
 Theneed to create a really united party, that is, to effect whatwas only foreshadowed in 1898, asserted itself more and moreinsistently. 
 Finally, at the end of 1902 an Organising Com-mittee was formed to convene the Second Party Congress. 
 This Organising Committee, which was largely set up by the Iskra organisation in Russia, also included a representative of the Jewish Bund. 
 In the autumn of 1903 the Second Con-gress was at last held; it ended, on the one hand, in theParty’s formal unification, and on the other, in a split into“majority” and “minority”. 
 That division did not exist before the Congress. 
 Only a detailed analysis of the struggle at the Congress can explain this division. 
 Unfortunately, the sup-porters of the minority (including Comrade Luxemburg)shy away fearfully from any such analysis. 
 In my book, presented to the German reader by Comrade Luxemburg in such a singular manner, I devote over a hun-dred pages to a close study of the Congress minutes (which make up a volume of some 400 pages). 
 This analysis causedme to divide the delegates, or rather votes (we had dele-gates with one vote and with two), into four main groups:1) majority Iskra -ists (adherents of the trend of the old Iskra )—twenty-four votes; 2) minority Iskra -ists—nine votes; 3) “Centre” (also referred to ironically as the “Marsh”)—ten votes; and, lastly, 4) anti-Iskra -ists—eight votes, making fifty-one votes in all. 
 I analyse the part played by thesegroups in all the voting at the Congress, and prove that on all issues (of programme, of tactics, and of organisation) theCongress was an arena of struggle between the Iskra -ists and the anti-Iskra -ists, with the “Marsh” making various zigzags. 
 Anyone even slightly familiar with our Party’shistory is bound to see that it could not have been other-wise. 
 But all supporters of the minority (including RosaLuxemburg) modestly close their eyes to this struggle. 
 Why?Because this struggle makes manifest the utter falsity of the minority’s present political position. 
 Throughout the struggle at the Party Congress, on dozens of questions, indozens of votes, the Iskra -ists fought the anti-Iskra -ists and the “Marsh”, which sided the more definitely with the anti-Iskra -ists, the more concrete the matter at issue, the more positively it affected the fundamentals of Social-Democratic activity, the more tangibly it involved puttinginto practice the old Iskra ’s long-standing plans. 
 The anti-Iskra -ists (particularly Comrade Akimov and the St. 
 Peters-burg Workers’ Organisation delegate, Comrade Brouckère,who always agreed with him, and nearly always Comrade Martynov and the five delegates of the Jewish Bund) were against recognising the trend of the old Iskra . 
 They defend-ed the old separate organisations and voted against theirsubordination to the Party, their fusion into the Party (theOrganising Committee incident, the dissolution of the Yuzh-ny Rabochy group—the leading group of the “Marsh”, and so on). 
 They fought against centralistic Rules of Organisation (14th sitting of the Congress) and accused all the Iskra -ists at that time of wanting to introduce “organised distrust”,“emergency laws”, and other such horrors. 
 All the Iskra -ists, without exception, laughed at it then; it is remarkablethat Comrade Rosa Luxemburg should now take these bogeys seriously. 
 On the great majority of questions the Iskra -ists carried the day; they predominated at the Congress, asis clear from the figures given above. 
 But during the secondhalf of the Congress, when less fundamental issues were beingdecided, the anti-Iskra -ists had the better of it—some of the Iskra -ists voted with them. 
 That was the case, for example, with regard to proclaiming equality of all languages in our programme; on this point the anti-Iskra -ists nearly succeeded in defeating the Programme Committee and getting theirformulation carried. 
 It was also the case over Paragraph 1of the Rules, when the anti-Iskra -ists and the “Marsh” put through Martov’s formulation. 
 According to this formulation, Party members are not only those who belong to Party organisations (the formulation defended by Plekhanov andmyself), but also all persons working under the control ofParty organisations. 
 * *Comrade Kautsky has sided with Martov’s formulation, and the argument he pleads is expediency. 
 In the first place, at our Party Congress this point was not discussed from the standpoint of expediency, but of principle. 
 That was the way the question was putby Axelrod. 
 Secondly, Comrade Kautsky is mistaken if he thinks that The same thing happened in the elections to the Central Committee and the editorial board of the Central Organ. 
 The compact majority consisted of 24 Iskra -ists, and they put through the long since planned reconstitution of the edi-torial board; of the six former editors, three were elected. 
The minority consisted of nine Iskra -ists, ten members of the “Centre”, and one anti-Iskra -ist (the other seven anti-Iskra -ists, representing the Jewish Bund and Rabocheye Dyelo , had withdrawn from the Congress by then). 
 This mi-nority was so displeased with the elections that it decidedto take no part in the rest of the elections. 
 Comrade Kautskywas quite right when he said that the reconstitution of theeditorial board was the main cause of the struggle that fol-lowed. 
 But his view that I ( sic!) “expelled” three comrades from the editorial board can only be attributed to his being totally uninformed about our Congress. 
 In the first place, non-election is far from the same thing as expulsion, and Icertainly had no power at the Congress to expel anyone; andsecondly, Comrade Kautsky seems to have no inkling thatthe fact of a coalition between the anti-Iskra -ists, the “Centre”, and a small section of the Iskra adherents had political im-plications too and could not fail to influence the outcome ofthe elections. 
 Anyone who does not wilfully close his eyesto what happened at our Congress is bound to see that ournew division into minority and majority is only a variantof the old division into a proletarian-revolutionary and an intellectual-opportunist wing of our Party. 
 That is a fact, and there is no explaining or laughing it away. 
 Unfortunately, after the Congress the principles involved in this division were obscured by squabbling over co-opta-tion: the minority would not work under the control of thecentral institutions unless the three ex-editors were again co-opted. 
 This fight went on for two months. 
 The weapons used were boycott and disruption of the Party. 
 Twelve com-mittees (out of the fourteen that spoke out on the subject)severely condemned these methods of struggle. 
 The minority under the Russian police regime there is such a big difference be-tween belonging to a Party organisation and simply working under its control. 
Thirdly, it is particularly misleading to compare the position inRussia today to that in Germany under the Anti-Socialist Law. 
 145 would not even accept the proposal, made by Plekhanov and myself, that they should set forth their point of view in Iskra . 
 At the Congress of the League Abroad the thing was carried to the length of showering the members of the cen-tral bodies with personal insults and abuse (autocrats,bureaucrats, gendarmes, liars, etc. 
, etc. 
). 
 They were accusedof suppressing individual initiative and wanting to introduceslavish submission, blind obedience, and so on. 
 Plekhanov’s attempts to characterise these minority methods of struggle as anarchistic did not avail. 
 After this Congress Plekhanovcame out with his epoch-making article against me, “WhatShould Not Be Done” (in No. 
 52 of Iskra ). 
 In this article he said that fighting revisionism did not necessarily, meanfighting the revisionists; and it was clear to all that he was referring to our minority. 
 He further said that one should not always fight the anarchistic individualism so deeply ingrainedin the Russian revolutionary, that at times some conces-sions were a better way to subdue it and avoid a split. 
 I resign-ed from the editorial board as I could not share this view,and the minority editors were co-opted. 
 Then followed a fight for co-optation to the Central Committee. 
 My offer to con-clude peace on the basis of the minority keeping the CentralOrgan and the majority the Central Committee was rejected. 
The fight went on, they were fighting “on principle” againstbureaucracy, ultra-centralism, formalism, Jacobinism,Schweitzerism (I was dubbed a Russian Schweitzer), and other such bogeys. 
 I ridiculed all these accusations in my book and pointed out that they were either just a matter of squabblingabout co-optation, or (if they were to be recognised, condi-tionally, as involving “principles”) nothing but opportunist,Girondist phrases. 
 The present minority are only repeatingwhat Comrade Akimov and other acknowledged opportunists said at our Congress against the centralism of all the adherents of the old Iskra . 
 The committees in Russia were outraged at the conver-sion of the Central Organ into the organ of a private circle,an organ of co-optation squabbling and Party scandal. 
A number of resolutions expressing the severest censure were passed. 
 Only the so-called St. 
 Petersburg Workers’ Organi-sation already mentioned and the Voronezh Committee(both of them supporters of Comrade Akimov’s trend) pronounced their satisfaction in principle at the trend of the new Iskra . 
 Demands to have the Third Party Congress sum-moned became ever more numerous. 
 The reader who takes the trouble to make a first-hand study of the struggle in our Party will readily see that, concretelyand practically, Comrade Rosa Luxemburg’s talk about“ultra-centralism”, about the need for centralisation to begradual, and the like, is a mockery of our Congress, while abstractly and theoretically (if one can speak here of theory at all) it is nothing but a vulgarisation of Marxism, a perver-sion of true Marxian dialectics, etc. 
 The latest phase in our Party struggle is marked by the fact that the majority members have in part been oustedfrom the Central Committee, in part rendered useless, reduced to nonentities. 
 (This happened owing to changes in the Central Committee’s composition, 146 etc. 
) The Party Council (which after the co-optation of the old editors like wise fell into theminority’s hands) and the present Central Committee havecondemned all agitation for summoning the Third Congressand are taking the path of personal deals and negotiations with some members of the minority. 
 Organisations which dared to commit such a crime as to agitate for a congress—asfor instance a certain agent body of the Central Committee—have been dissolved. 
 147 A campaign against the summoning of the Third Congress has been proclaimed by the Party Coun-cil and the new Central Committee all along the line. 
 The majority have replied with the slogan “Down with Bonapart-ism!” (that is the title of a pamphlet by Comrade Galyor-ka, 148 who speaks for the majority). 
 More and more resolu-tions are being passed declaring that Party institutions whichfight against a congress are anti-Party and Bonapartist. 
How hypocritical was all the minority’s talk against ultra-centralism and in favour of autonomy is obvious from the fact that a new majority publishing house started by myselfand another comrade (which issued the above-namedpamphlet by Comrade Galyorka and some others) has beendeclared outside the Party. 
 149 This new publishing house affords the majority their only opportunity of propagating their views, for the columns of Iskra are as good as closed to them. 
 Yet—or rather just because of it—the Party Councilhas made the above ruling, on the purely formal grounds /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR that our publishing house has not been authorised by any Party organisation. 
 It need hardly be said how greatly positive work has been neglected, how greatly the prestige of Social-Democracy hassuffered, how greatly the whole Party is demoralised by thisnullification of all the decisions, all the elections made bythe Second Congress, and this fight which Party institutionsaccountable to the Party are waging against the convening of the Third Congress. 
 Written in the latter half Russian text translated of September 1904 from the German First published in 1930 Published according to in Lenin Miscellany XV the manuscript AN OBLIGING LIBERAL Obliging services are welcome, as we know; But shun the service or a clumsy f riend. 
From such as Struve heaven us defend, Obliging Struve’s worse than any foe. 
 150 The latest issue (No. 
 57) of Mr. 
 Struve’s Osvobozhdeniye contains the following instructive lines: “The process of disintegration within the so-called Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party has entered a new phase. 
 The extreme cen-tralists (‘Leninists’, ‘firm-liners’, ‘Bolshevists’) are beginning tolose ground, and the position of their opponents is becoming stronger and stronger—at least in the ‘colonies’ abroad. 
 Whereas the ‘Men-shevists’ (Martovites) are getting the upper hand nearly everywhereand gaining control of one party organ after another, the ‘Bolshevists’are losing individuals and whole groups, who, while not definitelyaccepting the ‘platform’ of the minority, nevertheless do not wishto war with the latter and endeavour to establish peace in the still discordant party. 
 ‘Conciliators’ are appearing on the scene who are anxious to put an end to this unseemly wrangling in which peoplehave ceased to understand not only each other, but even themselves. 
The appearance of these ‘conciliators’ has compelled the irreconcilablecentralists to start a ‘publishing house of Social-Democratic Partyliterature devoted to the defence of the principles of the Second Party Congress majority’. 
 (Announcement by V. 
 Bonch-Bruyevich and N. 
 Lenin. 
) We have before us three products of this new publishinghouse: 1) To the Party , Geneva, 1904, 16 pp. 
, price 20 cent. 
 or 15 pf. 
; 2) Galyorka, Down with Bonapartism! , Geneva, 1904, 23 pp. 
, price 25 cent. 
 or 20 pf. 
; 3) Galyorka and Ryadovoy, 151 Our Misunderstand-ings , Geneva, 1904, price 50 cent. 
 or 40 pf. 
 These three pamphlets are chiefly devoted to a critical examination of certain methods— which are indeed not altogether above reproach—employed by the‘Menshevists’ in their struggle against the ‘majority’, and to advocacyof the thesis that the convening of a third congress to settle partyconflicts is not only feasible, but essential. 
 “While formally , from the standpoint of party loyalty, the posi-tion of the ‘Bolshevists’ is the sounder one, they yield to their oppo-thing more vital and effectual than the ‘Bolshevists’. 
 Only it is un-fortunate that this defence is being conducted by not altogether pro-per, or rather altogether improper, and sometimes positively inde-cent, means. 
 As examples of such improper methods we may citecountless recent articles in Iskra and the newly published pamphlet Our Political Tasks (Tactical and Organisational Questions ) by N. 
 Trots-ky, Geneva, 1904, 107 pp. 
, price 75 cent. 
 While marked in manyplaces by empty phrase-mongering, this pamphlet is however quite rightin taking up the cudgels for certain ideas with which those interestedin Social-Democratic literature are already familiar from the writingsof Messrs. 
 Akimov, Martynov, Krichevsky, and other so-called ‘Econ-omists’. 
 Only it is a pity that in places the author carries their viewsto the point of caricature. 
” How much malicious rejoicing we find here over the trou-bles of our Party! But then, by his very political nature yourliberal is bound to rejoice at any weakening and demorali-sation of Social-Democracy. 
 How much conscious and heartfelt sympathy for the Aki-movite substance of the minority’s views! But then, is it not a fact that the only hope of vitality, ideological vitality,for Russian liberalism lies in the vitality of Social-Demo-cratic opportunism? The new Iskra has no luck with its supporters. 
 Recall Plekhanov’s celebrated, stupendous, epoch-making “What Should Not Be Done”. 
 How subtly conceived was this policy of finesse and personal concessions, and what a sadmess our diplomat landed in! How accurately did that con-sistent opportunist, Mr. 
 Struve, perceive the “significant change of front” of the new Iskra ! The “gulf” between the old and the new Iskra is now admitted by the leaders of the latter themselves. 
 Recall Plekhanov’s complacent assertion in Iskra , No. 
 65, that “nobody is afraid of Akimov; you couldn’t use him now even to scare the sparrows in a cabbage-patch”. 
 Plekhanov made this remark, which was not particularly mild or accom-modating towards the Rabocheye Dyelo -ists, and he also declared that at our Party Congress “nobody spoke against orthodox Marxism except an Akimov or so”. 
 And then, rightafter these complacent assertions, the leaflet of the Voro-nezh Committee—which as everybody knows solidly sup-ports Comrades Akimov and Brouckère—was reprintedin full ; and it turned out that the editors of the new Iskra of this leaflet that had to do with principles, and all its expressions of sympathy with the new Iskra . 
 Who is it that has proved to resemble a sparrow? And what Party institu-tion may now be likened to a cabbage-patch? Recall the author of “High Time!”, the article in the sup-plement to Nos. 
 73-74 of Iskra . 
 As a frank and honest spokes-man of the views advocated throughout our Congress by allthe “Marsh” delegates, this comrade bluntly proclaimed his disagreement with Plekhanov, he bluntly stated his opinion that “at the Congress Akimov played the part ofa spectre of opportunism rather than of a real representativeof it”. 
 And the poor editors had once more to undergo a self-inflicted thrashing. 
 They appended the following note tothis statement of the author of “High Time!”: “We cannot agree with this opinion. 
 Comrade Akimov’s program-matic views bear the clear stamp of opportunism, as is admitted evenby an Osvobozhdeniye critic when he says in a recent issue that Comrade Akimov belongs to the ‘realistic’—read, revisionist—trend. 
” Very nice, is it not? In the programmatic views of Comrade Akimov—with whom, in the disputes over the programme, Comrades Martynov, Brouckère, and the Bundists voted almost invariably, and the delegates of the Marsh very of-ten—there is opportunism. 
 But in his tactical and organi-sational views there is no opportunism—is that your idea,gentlemen? Why is it that you prefer to say nothing aboutthese latter views? Isn’t it because, after loudly announcing its new differences over organisational questions, the new Iskra has said just what, and only what, Martynov and Aki-mov used to say against the old Iskra ? Isn’t it because the new tactical differences that the new Iskra has lately announced also amount to nothing but a repetition of what Martynovand Akimov used to say long ago against the old Iskra ? How useful it would be to republish today No. 
 10 of Rabo-cheye Dyelo ! And whom do the editors of the new Iskra cite as judge and witness against Comrade Akimov? Mr. 
 Struve. 
 Anda fine judge he is, truly a specialist, connoisseur, champion,and expert in opportunism. 
 All the more significant is the testimony of this witness, summoned by the editors them-selves, on the substance of Trotsky’s views. 
 And Trotsky’s pamphlet, please do not forget, was published under the editorship of “Iskra ” (No. 
 72, p. 
 10, col. 
 3). 
 Trotsky’s “new” views are the views of the editorial board, approved by Ple-khanov, Axelrod, Zasulich, Starover, and Martov. 
 Empty phrase-mongering and Akimovism, the latter, unfortunately, in caricature—such is the verdict of a judgesympathetic to the new Iskra and appealed to by that organ itself. 
 This time the obliging liberal inadvertently blurted out the truth. 
 Written in October 1904 Published in leaflet form Published according in Geneva in November 1904 to the leaflet text PREFACE TO N. 
 SHAKHOV ’S PAMPHLET THE FIGHT FOR A CONGRESS In the pamphlet here offered to the reader we have endeav-oured to give as full as possible a collection of documentsshowing the attitude of various Party organisations workingon the spot towards the present crisis in our Party. 
 These documents are reproduced partly from texts already pub-lished in Iskra and partly direct from the manuscripts, and the reader should bear in mind that owing to the conditionsunder which these manuscripts were delivered mistakes andomissions were sometimes bound to creep in. 
 The contents of the documents revolve around one cen-tral point—the fight for the party spirit against the circle spirit, the fight for a congress. 
 Originally this was a fightfor the Second Party Congress, for the recognition and honestobservance of its decisions; now it is for the Third Congress,as the only method worthy of the Party of ending the pre-sent intolerable situation. 
 We have also tried to show as fully as possible, on the basis of documentary evidence, the fight of the Party’s present central institutions againsta third congress. 
 Our work has been confined to arranging the documents in chronological order (as far as possible) and adding the brief-est explanations to indicate the connection between them. 
 We leave all comment for subsequent publications. 
 The bare facts regarding the fight for a congress speak for themselves,and anybody who studies them will be able to form his ownjudgement of the internal struggle in our Party. 
 Published in the pamphlet The Fight for a Congress , Published according by N. 
 Shakhov, Geneva, 1904 to the manuscript ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE FORMATION OF A BUREAU OF MAJORITY COMMITTEES152 DRAFT The crisis in the Party is dragging on interminably and becoming ever more difficult to resolve. 
 The adherents of the majority have repeatedly stated in the press their viewsconcerning the causes of the crisis and the means by whichit could be ended. 
 The statement of the twenty-two, * which was supported by a number of committees (the Odessa, Eka-terinoslav, Nikolayev, Riga, St. 
 Petersburg, and Moscow committees and the Caucasian League), by the declaration of the nineteen, 153 and by the majority members, abroad gave a full and precise exposition of the majority’s programme. 
Everyone at all acquainted with the development of thecrisis and at all concerned for the Party’s honour and dig-nity has long realised that the only way out is a Party con-gress. 
 But now the new declaration by a section of the Central Committee and the new decisions of the Party Coun-cil aggravate the division in the Party still more. 
 The Cen-tral Committee members who have deserted to the minorityhave not shrunk from the grossest violation of the rightsof those members of the Central Committee who remain on the side of the majority. 
 In proclaiming its reconciliation policy the new Central Committee has not only failed totake account of the wishes of the majority, but has totallyignored the latter and entered into a compact with theminority alone, and moreover by means of private, secrettransactions. 
 Anyone sincerely desiring a reconciliation would first of all bring together all the warring, contending, *See pp. 
 452-59 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 and mutually incensed, and that means calling a Party con-gress. 
 To talk of peace and fear a congress, to go about peace-making and at the same time hold up the bogey of a splitbecause of the minority’s probable defeat at the Third Con-gress also, is to be a hypocrite, to try to force the caprice of an émigré circle on the Party workers in Russia, to sancti-fy with the specious slogan of peace a complete betrayal of the majority. 
 In the name of peace the new Central Committee is breaking up organisations which have the auda-city to want a congress. 
 In the name of peace the new Central Committee proclaims the publications of the majority to be non-Party publications and refuses to supply them to thecommittees. 
 In the name of peace the new Central Commit-tee is injecting a squabbling element into the decisions of the Party Council, which dares to talk in print about “deceit”on the part of comrades whose actions have not been inves-tigated yet and who have not even been presented with the charges made against them. 
 The Party Council is now directlyfalsifying the opinion and verdict of the Party membership, by having the committee resolutions scrutinised by a Cen-tral Committee notoriously hostile to a congress, by castingsuspicion on these resolutions, delaying their publication, gerrymandering the number of votes, arrogating to itself the congress prerogative of declaring mandates invalid, and dis-organising positive work by stirring up the local commit-tees’ “peripheral organisations” against them. 
 Meanwhile the centrally conducted positive work is also at a standstillbecause the Central Committee and Central Organ are engrossed in resisting a congress. 
 No course remains to the majority committees and orga-nisations but to unite to fight for a congress, against the so-called central institutions of the Party, which in fact are directly flouting the Party. 
 We are making a beginningof such unity by forming a Bureau of Majority Committees, on the initiative and by the common consent of the Odessa, Ekaterinoslav, Nikolayev, Riga, St. 
 Petersburg, andMoscow committees. 
 Our slogan is the fight for the party spirit against the circle spirit, the fight for the consistent revolutionary line againstzigzags, confusion, and a reversion to Rabocheye Dyelo -ism, a Front page of the manuscript of Lenin’s “Announcement of the Formation of a Bureau of Majority Committees”, 1904 Rescued fight in the name of proletarian organisation and discipline against the disrupters of organisation. 
 Our immediate objects are to build up ideological and organisational unity of the majority in Russia and abroad,to support and promote in every way the publishing houseof the majority (started abroad by Comrades Bonch-Bruye-vich and Lenin), to combat the Bonapartism of our centralinstitutions, to ensure the correctness of measures for con-vening the Third Congress, and to assist the positive work of the committees, which is being disrupted by the agentsof the editorial board and the new Central Committee. 
 Bureau of Majority Committees In Russia the Bureau can be contacted through the major-ity committees, and abroad through the Bonch-Bruyevichand Lenin publishing house.

 2 THE ZEMSTVO CAMPAIGN AND ISKRA ’S PLAN154 Written in November 1904 Published in pamphlet form Published according in Geneva in November 1904 to the pamphlet text F O R P A R T Y M E M B E R S O N L Y The editorial board of Iskra has just issued (“for Party members”) a letter addressed to the Party organisations. 
Russia has never been within such close distance of a con-stitution, say the editors; and they expound a completeplan for a “political campaign”, a complete plan for influenc-ing our liberal Zemstvo-ist petitioners for a constitution. 
 Before analysing this exceedingly instructive plan of the new Iskra ’s, let us recall how the Russian Social-Demo-crats have regarded the question of their attitude towardsthe liberal Zemstvo-ists since a mass working-class move-ment arose. 
 Everyone knows that, practically from the inception of the mass working-class movement, a struggle went on between the “Economists” and the revolutionariesover this question too. 
 The former went so far as directlyto deny the existence of a bourgeois-democratic elementin Russia and ignore the proletariat’s task of influencing theopposition strata of society; at the same time, by narrowing the scope of the political struggle of the proletariat, they consciously or unconsciously left the role of political leader-ship to the liberal elements of society, assigning to the wor-kers “the economic struggle against the employers and thegovernment”. 
 The adherents of revolutionary Social-Dem-ocracy fought in the old Iskra against this trend. 
 This struggle may be divided into two main periods: the period before the appearance of a liberal organ— Osvobozhdeniye — and the period after it appeared. 
 During the first period wedirected our attack mainly against the narrowness of theEconomists; we tried to “wake them up” to the fact, whichthey failed to perceive, of the existence of a bourgeois-dem-ocratic element in Russia; we emphasised the need for polit-ical activity by the proletariat in every sphere, we stressedthat the proletariat must influence all sections of society, that it must become the vanguard in the battle for freedom. 
 It is the more fitting and necessary to recall this period and its main features now because the adherents of the new Iskra grossly falsify it (see Trotsky’s Our Political Tasks , published under the editorship of Iskra ), banking on the unfamiliarity of the younger generation with the recent history of our move-ment. 
 From the time of the appearance of Osvobozhdeniye , the second period in the old Iskra ’s fight began. 
 When the liber-als came out with an organ and political programme oftheir own, the proletariat’s task of influencing “society”naturally underwent a modification: working-class democratscould no longer confine themselves to “shaking up” the libe-ral democrats and rousing their opposition spirit; they had to put the emphasis on revolutionary criticism of the half-heartedness so clearly exhibited in the political positionof liberalism. 
 The influence we brought to bear on the liber-al strata now took the form of constantly pointing out theinconsistency and inadequacy of the liberals’ political pro-test (it is sufficient to mention Zarya , which criticised Mr. 
 Struve’s preface to the Witte Memorandum, * also numerous articles in Iskra). 
 By the time of the Second Party Congress this new atti-tude of the Social-Democrats towards the now articulateliberals was already so well-defined and established thatthere was no question in anyone’s mind about whether a bour-geois-democratic element existed in Russia and whether the opposition movement ought to receive support (and whatkind of support) from the proletariat. 
 The only questionwas how to formulate the Party’s views on the subject; andI need only point out here that the views of the old Iskra were much better expressed in Plekhanov’s resolution, which emphasised the anti-revolutionary and anti-proletarian char-acter of the liberal Osvobozhdeniye , than in the confused reso-lution tabled by Starover, which, on the one hand, aimed(quite inopportunely) at an “agreement” with the liberals,and, on the other, stipulated for it conditions that weremanifestly unreal, being altogether impossible for the liber-als to fulfil. 
 *See present edition, Vol. 
 5, pp. 
 31-80. 
— Ed. 
 I Now let us examine the new Iskra ’s plan. 
 The editors acknowledge that we must make full use of all materialshowing the irresolution and half-heartedness of the liberaldemocrats and the antagonism of interests between the liber-al bourgeoisie and the proletariat, must do so “in accordancewith the fundamental demands of our programme”. 
 “But,” the editors continue, “ but within the framework of the strug-gle with absolutism, notably in its present phase, our attitudetowards the liberal bourgeoisie is determined by the task of spurring it to greater boldness and inducing it to joinin the demands which the proletariat, led by the Social-Democrats, will put forward [? has put forward?]. 
” We have italicised the particularly strange words in this strange tirade. 
 For what is it if not strange to contrast criticism of half-heartedness and analysis of antagonistic interests, on theone hand, and the task of spurring these people to greaterboldness and inducing them to join, on the other? How canwe spur the liberal democrats to greater boldness except by relentless analysis and devastating criticism of the half-heartedness of their democracy? Insofar as the bourgeois(liberal) democrats intend to act as democrats, and are forcedto act as democrats, they necessarily seek the support ofthe widest possible sections of the people. 
 This inevitablyproduces the following contradiction. 
 The wider these sec-tions of the people, the more representatives are there among them of the proletarian and semi-proletarian strata, whodemand the complete democratisation of the political andsocial system—such complete democratisation as wouldthreaten to undermine very important pillars of all bourgeoisrule (the monarchy, the standing army, the bureaucracy). 
 Bourgeois democrats are by their very nature incapable of satisfying these demands, and are therefore, by their verynature, doomed to irresolution and half-heartedness. 
 Bycriticising this half-heartedness, the Social-Democrats keepprodding the liberals on and winning more and more prole-tarians and semi-proletarians, and partly petty bourgeois too, from liberal democracy to working-class democracy. 
 How then is it possible to say: we must criticise the half-hearted-ness of the liberal bourgeoisie, b u t (but!) our attitude towards it is determined by the task of spurring it to greater boldness? Why, that is plain muddle-headedness, which shows that its authors are either marching backward, revert-ing to the days when the liberals did not come forward open-ly at all, when they had still to be roused, stirred, inducedto open their mouths—or else are slipping into the idea thatone can “spur” the liberals to greater boldness by subtractingfrom the boldness of the proletarians. 
 Preposterous as this idea is, we find it again, even more clearly expressed, in the very next passage of the editors’letter: “But”—again that editorial reservation—“but weshould be making a fatal mistake if we tried by strongmeasures of intimidation to force the Zemstvos or other organs of the bourgeois opposition to give here and now, under the influence of panic , a formal promise to present our demands to the government. 
 Such a tactic would discredit the Social-Democrats, because it would make our entire political cam-paign a lever for reaction. 
” (Editors’ italics. 
) So that’s how it is, is it? Before the revolutionary prole-tariat has dealt the tsarist autocracy a single serious blow, at a time when that autocracy is so visibly shaken and when a serious blow is so imperative, would be so useful, and mightprove decisive, there are Social-Democrats who go aboutmumbling about levers for reaction. 
 This is not just muddle-headedness, it is sheer inanity. 
 This is what the editorshave come to with their terrible bogey, invented specially to start this talk about becoming a lever for reaction. 
 Just think of it: that people should talk in all seriousness, in aletter to the Social-Democratic Party organisations, of tac-tics of intimidating the Zemstvo-ists and forcing them togive formal promises under the influence of panic! Evenamong Russian officialdom, even among our Ugryum-Bur-cheyevs, 155 it would not be easy to find a political infant who would believe in such a bogey. 
 We have among our revol-utionists hotheaded terrorists, desperate bomb-throwers;but even the most hare-brained of the hare-brained defend-ers of bomb throwing have yet, I believe, to propose intimi-dating ... the Zemstvo-ists and striking panic into ... the oppo-sition. 
 Cannot the editors see that the inevitable effect of their ridiculous bogeys and inane phrases is to perplex andmislead, to befog and confuse the minds of the fighting prole-tarians? After all, these catchwords about levers for reaction and the discrediting tactics of intimidation do not fly into empty space; they fall upon the specific soil of police-ridden Russia, so eminently suited for the sprouting of weeds. 
Talk about levers for reaction is indeed to be heard at everystreet corner nowadays, but it comes from the Novoye Vremya gentry. 
 156 The story about the discrediting tactics of intimi-dation has indeed been repeated ad nauseam —by the cow-ardly leaders of the bourgeois opposition. 
 Take Prof. 
 Prince E. 
 N. 
 Trubetskoy. 
 A sufficiently “enlightened” and—for a legal Russian personality—a suf-ficiently “bold” liberal, one would think. 
 Yet how fatu-ously he discourses in the liberal Pravo (No. 
 39) on the “internal danger”, namely, the danger from the extreme parties! There you have a live example of who really is close to panic; a graphic instance of what really does have anintimidating effect on real liberals. 
 What they are afraid of,it need hardly be said, is not the plan conjured up by theIskra editors, the plan of extorting from the Zemstvo-ists formal promises to the revolutionaries (Mr. 
 Trubetskoy would only roar with laughter if told of such a plan); they are afraid of the revolutionary socialist aims of the “extreme”parties, they are afraid of leaflets, those first harbingers ofindependent revolutionary action by the proletariat, whichwill not stop, will not lay down its arms until it has over-thrown the rule of the bourgeoisie. 
 This fear is not inspired by ludicrous bogeys, but by the actual nature of the working-class movement; and it is a fear ineradicable from the heartsof the bourgeoisie (not counting a few individuals and groups,of course). 
 And that is why the new Iskra ’s talk about the discrediting tactics of intimidating the Zemstvo-ists andrepresentatives of the bourgeois opposition rings so false. 
 Afraid of leaflets, afraid of anything that goes beyond a qualified franchise constitution, the liberal gentry will alwaysstand in fear of the slogan “a democratic republic” and of thecall for an armed uprising of the people. 
 But the class-conscious proletariat will indignantly reject the very ideathat we could renounce this slogan and this call, or could in general be guided in our activity by the panic and fears of the bourgeoisie. 
 Take Novoye Vremya . 
 What dulcet melodies it weaves about the lever-for-reaction theme! “The youth and reac-tion,” we read in the “Notes” in No. 
 10285 (October 18). 
 “...The words go ill together, and yet unconsidered actions,impulsive ardour, and the desire at all costs to share immedi-ately in shaping the nation’s fortunes may bring the youthto this hopeless impasse. 
 The demonstration a few days ago infront of the Vyborg prison; then the attempt at some sort of demonstration in the heart of the capital; in Moscow, the procession of 200 students with banners and protests againstthe war.... 
 All this explains the reaction.... 
 Student distur-bances, youth demonstrations—why, they are a real god-send, a trump card, an unexpected ace of trumps in the handsof the reactionaries. 
 Truly a welcome present for them, which they will know how to make the most of. 
 We should not make them these presents, should not go about smashingimaginary [!!!] window-bars; the very doors are open now[the doors of the Vyborg and other prisons?], wide open!” This disquisition requires no comment. 
 One has only to quote it to see how tactless it is to talk about a lever for reaction now— now , when not one door of the all-Russia prison has opened a hair’s breath for the struggling workers;when the tsarist autocracy has not yet made a single con-cession that would affect the proletariat in the slightest;when all attention and efforts should be centred on preparingfor a real and decisive battle with the Russian people’s enemy. 
 Of course, the very thought of such a battle strikes fear and panic into the Trubetskoys and the thousands ofless “enlightened” liberal gentlemen. 
 But we should be foolsif we took their panic into consideration. 
 What we shouldtake into consideration is the state of our forces, the growthof popular ferment and indignation, the moment when the proletariat’s direct onslaught on the autocracy will link up with one of the spontaneous and spontaneously growingmovements. 
 II In speaking above of the bogey our editors conjured up, we did not mention another characteristic little point in their argument. 
 The editors denounce the discreditingtactics of seeking to extort from the Zemstvo-ists “a formal promise to present our demands to the government”. 
 Over and above the absurdities already noted, the very idea that “our” demands, the demands of working-class democrats, should be presented to the government by liberal democrats is a peculiar one. 
 On the one hand, the liberal democrats,being bourgeois democrats, can never identify themselveswith “our” demands, can never uphold them sincerely, con-sistently, and resolutely. 
 Even if the liberals gave, and gave “voluntarily”, a formal promise to present our demands, it is a foregone conclusion that they would fail to keepthat promise, would betray the proletariat. 
 On the otherhand, if we should be strong enough to exert serious influenceon the bourgeois democrats generally and the Zemstvogentlemen in particular, we should be quite strong enough to present our demands to the government ourselves. 
 The editors’ peculiar idea is no slip of the pen, but an inevitable product of their general confused position onthis issue. 
 Listen to this: “As our focal point and guidingthread ... we must take the practical task ... of exerting pow-erful organised pressure upon the bourgeois opposition”; “the draft of the workers’ statement to the liberal opposi-tion organ in question” must “explain why the workers arenot approaching the government, but an assembly of repre-sentatives of that opposition”. 
 To put the thing in this wayis a fundamental mistake. 
 We, the party of the proletariat,should, of course, “go to all classes of the population”, openly and vigorously championing our programme and our immediate demands before the people at large; we shouldseek to present these demands to the Zemstvo gentlemen too;but our focal point and guiding thread must be pressure onthe government, not on the Zemstvo-ists. 
 The editors ofIskra have turned this question of the focal point completely upside down. 
 The bourgeois opposition is merely bourgeois and merely an opposition because it does not itself fight,because it has no programme of its own that it unconditionallyupholds, because it stands between the two actual combatants(the government and the revolutionary proletariat withits handful of intellectual supporters) and hopes to turn the outcome of this struggle to its own advantage. 
 According-ly, the more heated the struggle becomes, the nearer themoment of the decisive battle, the more must we focus our attention and bring our pressure to bear on our actual enemy, and not on a notoriously conditional, problematic, unreliable, half-hearted ally. 
 It would be foolish to ignore this ally, and absurd to try to intimidate and frighten him—all that is so self-evident that it is strange even to talkabout it. 
 But, I repeat, the focal point and guiding threadin our agitation must not be pressure on this ally, butpreparation for the decisive battle with the enemy. 
 For while it has been flirting with the Zemstvos and has granted them some paltry concessions, the government has not, inactual fact, conceded anything whatever to the people; itmay still well revert to (or rather continue) its reactionarycourse, as has happened in Russia tens and hundreds oftimes after a momentary flash of liberalism from one auto-crat or another. 
 At a moment like this, when the government is flirting with the Zemstvos and the people are being hood-winked and lulled with empty words, we must particularlybeware of the fox’s cunning, must be particularly insistentin pointing out that the enemy has yet to be defeated, mustcall with particular vigour for continuing and intensifying the fight against the enemy, and not shift the emphasis from “approaching” the government to approaching the Zemstvos. 
None other than the notorious cream-skimmers andbetrayers of freedom are hard at work at this moment to putthe Zemstvos in the focus of public and popular attentionand to inspire confidence in them, when actually they do not in the least deserve the confidence of genuine democrats. 
 Take Novoye Vremya : in the article we have already quoted you will find the following argument: “Anyone can see thatonce all our failings and shortcomings can be boldly andcandidly discussed and there is freedom for the activity ofevery public personality, it should not be long before we see the last of these shortcomings and Russia is able to set foot confidently on the path of the progress and improvementshe so sorely needs. 
 We do not even have to invent theorganisation to serve as the instrument of this progress: itis already to hand in the form of the Zemstvos, which only[!!] need to be given the freedom to grow; therein lies the earnest of genuinely national, not borrowed, progress. 
” This kind of talk not only “conceals a desire for a limitedmonarchy and a qualified-franchise constitution” (as the editors put it elsewhere in their letter); it directly prepares the ground for reducing the whole business to a bestowal of smiles on the Zemstvos, without even any limitation of the monarchy. 
 Making pressure on the Zemstvos instead of on the govern-ment the focal point leads naturally to the unfortunate ideathat underlay Starover’s resolution—the idea of tryingto find, now at once, a basis for some sort of “agreements” with the liberals. 
 “As regards the present Zemstvos,” the editors say in their letter, “our task reduces itself [!!] topresenting to them those political demands of the revolution-ary proletariat which they must support if they are tohave any right to speak in the name of the people and counton the energetic support of the worker masses. 
” A fine def-inition of the tasks of the workers’ party, I must say! At a time when an alliance of the moderate Zemstvo-istsand the government to fight the revolutionary proletariat isonly too clearly possible and probable (the editors them-selves admit the possibility of such an alliance), we are to“reduce” our task, not to redoubling our efforts in the strug-gle against the government, but to drawing up casuistic conditions for agreements with the liberals on mutual sup-port. 
 If I put before someone demands which he must un-dertake to support to have me support him, what I am doingis concluding an agreement. 
 And we ask all and sundry:what has become of the “conditions” for agreements with the liberals which were prescribed in Starover’s resolution * (signed also by Axelrod and Martov), and which our press has already predicted could never be fulfilled? The editors’letter does not say a word about these conditions. 
 The edi-tors advocated the resolution at the Congress only to throw *The reader will recall that Starover’s resolution, which was passed by the Congress (in spite of Plekhanov’s opinion and mine), lays down three conditions for temporary agreements with the liberals:1) the liberals “shall clearly and unambiguously declare that in theirstruggle against the autocratic government they will resolutely side with the Social-Democrats”; 2) “they shall not include in their pro-grammes any demands running counter to the interests of the workingclass or the democracy generally, or obscuring their political conscious-ness”; 3) “they shall make universal, equal, secret, and direct suffragethe slogan of their struggle”. 
 it into the waste-paper basket afterwards. 
 At the very first attempt to tackle the matter in practice it became apparent that presenting Starover’s “conditions” would only provoke Homeric laughter from the Zemstvo liberals. 
 Let us proceed. 
 Can it in general be acknowledged correct in principle to set the workers’ party the task of presenting to the liberal democrats or the Zemstvo-ists political de-mands “which they must support if they are to have any right to speak in the name of the people”? No, such an approach is wrong in principle and can only obscure the class con-sciousness of the proletariat and lead to the most futilecasuistry. 
 To speak in the name of the people is what speak-ing as a democrat means. 
 Any democrat (the bourgeoisdemocrat included) has a right to speak in the name of the people, but he has this right only insofar as he champions democracy consistently, resolutely, going all the way. 
 Con-sequently, every bourgeois democrat “has some right to speak in the name of the people” (for every bourgeois democrat,so long as he remains a democrat, champions some demo-cratic demand); but at the same time no bourgeois democrat has a right to speak in the name of the people all along the line (for no bourgeois democrat is capable today of champion-ing democracy resolutely and all the way). 
 Mr. 
 Struvehas a right to speak in the name of the people insofar asOsvobozhdeniye fights against the autocracy; but Mr. 
 Struve has no right to speak in the name of the people insofar as Osvobozhdeniye turns and twists, stops short at a qualified-franchise constitution, equates Zemstvo opposition withstruggle, and will not commit itself to a clear and consistentdemocratic programme. 
 The German National-Liberalshad a right to speak in the name of the people insofar as theyfought for freedom of movement. 
 The German National-Liberals had no right to speak in the name of the people insofar as they supported the reactionary policy of Bismarck. 
 Therefore, to set the workers’ party the task of presenting to the liberal bourgeois demands which they must supportin order to have any right to speak in the name of the peopleis an absurd and nonsensical proceeding. 
 There is no need for us to invent any special democratic demands over and above those contained in our programme. 
 In the nameof that programme we must support every democrat (including the bourgeois democrat) insofar as he champions democracy, and must relentlessly expose every democrat (including the Socialist-Revolutionary) insofar as he deviates from democ-racy (as, for instance, in such questions as the freedom ofthe peasant to leave the commune or to sell his land). 
 Asfor trying to establish in advance the permissible degree ofturpitude, so to speak, to determine beforehand what devia-tions from democracy a democrat can permit himself and still have some right to speak as a democrat, that is such a clever idea that one can’t help wondering whether Com-rade Martynov or Comrade Dan did not lend our editorsa hand in inventing it. 
 III After setting forth their guiding political considerations, the editors’ letter proceeds to expound the details of theirgreat plan. 
 The Gubernia Zemstvo Assemblies are petitioning for a constitution. 
 In the towns of X, Y, Z, our committeemen plus the enlightened workers draw up a plan of political campaign “according to Axelrod”. 
 The focal point in theiragitation is pressure on the bourgeois opposition. 
 An orga-nising group is elected. 
 The organising group elects an execu-tive committee. 
 The executive committee elects a specialspokesman. 
 Efforts are made “to bring the masses into direct contact with the Zemstvo Assembly, to concentrate the demonstration before the actual premises where theZemstvo assemblymen are in session. 
 Some of the demonstra-tors penetrate into the session hall, and at a suitable moment,through the spokesman specially authorised for the purpose,they ask the permission of the Assembly [? of the Marshal of the Nobility, who presides at the Assembly?] to read out a statement on behalf of the workers. 
 If this is not granted,the spokesman enters a loud protest against the refusal ofan Assembly which speaks in the name of the people tohear the voice of the people’s genuine representatives”. 
 Such is the new Iskra ’s new plan. 
 We shall see in a moment how modest is the editors’ opinion of it; but first let us quote their highly profound explanations as to the functionsof the executive committee: “...The executive committee must take measures in advance to ensure that the appearance of several thousand workers outside the building where the Zemstvo as-semblymen are in session, and of several score or hundredin the building itself, shall not plunge the Zemstvo-ists into panic fear [!!], under the impact of which they might throw themselves [!] under the shameful protection of the policeand Cossacks, thus transforming a peaceful demonstration into an ugly fight and brutal battering, distorting its whole meaning.... 
” (The editors themselves seem to have been tak-en in by the bogey of their own making. 
 Taking the sentencein its literal, grammatical sense, they even seem to besaying that it is the Zemstvo-ists who would be transformingthe demonstration into a brutal battering and distorting its meaning. 
 We have a very low opinion of the Zemstvo liberals, but even so the editors’ panic fear that the liberalsin a Zemstvo Assembly might call in the police and Cossacksseems to us quite nonsensical. 
 Anyone who has ever attend-ed a Zemstvo Assembly will know that, in the event ofso-called disorder, the police would be sent for either by the presiding Marshal of the Nobility or by the police officer unofficially present in an adjoining room. 
 Or per-haps the members of the executive committee are to explainto this police officer that it is no part of the new Iskra ’s “plan” to have a peaceful demonstration transformed intoa brutal battering?) “To obviate such a surprise, the executive committee must inform the liberal assemblymen beforehand [so thatthey may give a “formal promise” not to send for the Cos-sacks?] of the forthcoming demonstration and its truepurpose [i. 
e. 
, inform them that our true purpose does notconsist in being brutally battered and so having the meaning of Axelrod’s plan distorted]. 
 Furthermore, it must try to reach some agreement [mark this!] with the representativesof the Left wing of the bourgeois opposition and secure,if not their active support, at any rate their sympathy withour political action. 
 Its negotiations with them must, itneed hardly be said, be conducted in the name of the Party and on the instructions of the workers’ circles and meetings, which should not only discuss the general plan of the polit-ical campaign but hear reports of its progress—the rules of secrecy being, of course, strictly observed. 
” Yes, yes, we can well see that Starover’s great idea of an agreement with the liberals on the basis of exactly pre-scribed conditions is gaining strength and substance daily andhourly. 
 To be sure, all these exactly prescribed conditionshave been shelved “for the time being” (we are no formalists!);but, on the other hand, an agreement is being reached in practice, now, at once, viz. 
, an agreement not to cause panic fear. 
 Whichever way one reads the editors’ letter, no other meaning of its famous “agreement” with the liberals can befound than that we have indicated: either it is an agree-ment about the conditions on which the liberals would have a right to speak in the name of the people (and in that case the very idea of it very seriously discredits the Social-Democrats who advance it); or else it is an agreement aboutnot causing panic fear, an agreement about sympathisingwith a peaceful demonstration—in which case it is just non-sense that can hardly be discussed seriously. 
 Nor could the absurd idea of the paramount importance of pressure on the bourgeois opposition, instead of on the government, haveresulted in anything but an absurdity. 
 If we are in a po-sition to organise an imposing mass demonstration of workersin the hall of a Zemstvo Assembly, we shall, of course, doso (though if we have forces enough for a mass demonstra-tion it would be much better to “concentrate” them “before the premises” not of the Zemstvo, but of the police, thegendarmerie, or the censorship). 
 But to be swayed whendoing so by considerations like the Zemstvo-ists’ panicfears, and to engage in negotiations on that score, wouldbe the height of ineptitude, the height of absurdity. 
 Among a good proportion, most likely the majority, of Russia’s Zemstvo-ists, the very content of a speech by a consistent Social-Democrat will always and inevitably arouse panicfear. 
 To parley with the Zemstvo-ists beforehand aboutthe undesirability of that sort of panic fear would place one in the falsest and most undignified kind of position. 
 A brutal battering, or the prospect of one, will just as inevitably arouse panic fear of another sort. 
 To engagein negotiations with the Zemstvo-ists concerning this panic fear would be very foolish, because not even the most moderate liberal will ever bring about such a battering or sympathise with it—but the thing does not depend upon him. 
 What is needed here is not “negotiations”, but the actualmustering of force; not pressure on the Zemstvo-ists, butpressure on the government and its agents. 
 If we have noforce behind us, better not to hold forth about great plans;and if we do have it, then it is force we must oppose to the Cossacks and police, we must try to gather a crowd of such size and in such a spot that it should be able to repel,or at least to check, the onslaught of the Cossacks and police. 
And if we are indeed capable of exerting “powerful organisedpressure upon the bourgeois opposition”, it is assuredlynot by silly “negotiations” about not causing panic fear, but by force and force alone, the force of mass resistance to the Cossacks and the tsarist police, the force of a massonslaught capable of growing into a popular uprising. 
 The editors of the new Iskra see things differently. 
 They are so pleased with their plan for an agreement and negotia-tions that they cannot admire it enough, cannot find praise enough to lavish on it. 
 ...The active demonstrators must be “imbued with an understanding of the fundamental difference between anordinary demonstration against the police or the governmentin general, and a demonstration immediately designed tofurther the struggle against absolutism, through direct pressure by the revolutionary proletariat on the political tactics [indeed!] of the liberal elements at the present [ital-icised by the editors] moment.... 
 To organise demonstrationsof the ordinary, so to speak, general-democratic [!!] type,not aiming directly at a concrete counterposing of the revo-lutionary proletariat and the liberal bourgeois opposition as two independent political forces, the mere existence of strong political ferment among the masses is sufficient.... 
Our Party must utilise this mood of the masses even forsuch, so to say, a lower type [note that!] of their mo-bilisation against absolutism.... 
 We are taking our first[!] steps on a new [!l path of political activity, the path of organising planned intervention by the worker masses [N. 
B. 
] in public life with the direct aim of counterposingthem to the bourgeois opposition as an independent force, which has opposite class interests, but which at the same time offers it conditions [what conditions?] for waging a vigorous joint struggle against the common enemy. 
” It is not given to everyone to appreciate all the profun-dity of this remarkable disquisition. 
 The Rostov demon-stration, 157 where thousands and thousands of workers were made familiar with the aims of socialism and the demandsof working-class democracy, is a “lower type of mobilisa-tion”, the ordinary, general-democratic type; here there is no concrete counterposing of the revolutionary proletariatand the bourgeois opposition. 
 But when a specially autho-rised spokesman appointed by an executive committee,which has been elected by an organising group, which hasbeen set up by the committeemen and active workers—when that spokesman, after first negotiating with the Zemstvo-ists, enters a loud protest in the Zemstvo Assembly becauseit declines to hear him—that will be a “concrete” and“direct” counterposing of two independent forces, that willbe “direct” pressure on the tactics of the liberals, thatwill be “a first step on a new path”. 
 For heaven’s sake, gen-tlemen! Why, even Martynov in the worst days of Rabocheye Dyelo hardly sank quite so low as this! The mass meetings of workers in the streets of the south-ern towns, dozens of worker speakers, direct clashes withthe real, tangible force of the tsarist autocracy—all that isa “lower type of mobilisation”. 
 Agreements with the Zemstvo-ists about a peaceful statement by our spokesman who will undertake not to cause panic among Messrs. 
 theliberals—that is a “new path”. 
 There you have the new tac-tical tasks, the new tactical views of the new Iskra , of which the world was informed with such pomp by the edi-torial Balalaikin. 
 158 On one point, though, this Balalaikin happened to speak the truth: between the old Iskra and the new there is indeed a yawning gulf. 
 The old Iskra had only contempt and derision for people who could admire,as a ‘new path”, a theatrically staged agreement betweenclasses. 
 This new path is one we have long known, from the record of those French and German Socialist “statesmen” who similarly regard the old revolutionary tactics as a “lower type” and never weary of praising “planned and direct in-tervention in public life” in the form of agreements to allow the workers’ spokesmen to make peaceful and modest state-ments after negotiations with the Left wing of the bourgeois opposition. 
 The editors are in such panic fear of the panic fear of the Zemstvo liberals that they insistently enjoin “par-ticular caution” on those who take part in their “new”plan. 
 “As an extreme case of external caution in the waythe action is actually carried out,” says the letter, “we can envisage mailing the workers’ statement to the assem-blymen’s homes and scattering a considerable number ofcopies in the Zemstvo Assembly hall. 
 Only people affectedwith bourgeois revolutionism [ sic!], for which the external effect is everything and the process of the systematicdevelopment of the class-consciousness and initiative of the proletariat is nothing, could have any objection to this. 
” Well, we are not wont to object to the mailing or scat-tering of leaflets, but we shall certainly always object topompous and hollow phrase-mongering. 
 To make the mail-ing and scattering of leaflets the occasion for talking with serious men about the process of the systematic development of the class-consciousness and initiative of the proletariat,one must be a veritable paragon of complacent banality. 
 Toclamour from the housetops about new tactical tasks andthen reduce the whole thing to the mailing and scatteringof leaflets is really priceless; and nothing could be more char-acteristic of the exponents of the intellectualist trend in our Party, who, now that their new words in organisationhave proved a fiasco, rush about frantically in search of a newword in tactics. 
 And then they talk, with their usual modesty,about the vanity of external effect! Can’t you see, my goodsirs, that at best, even supposing your so-called new plan were entirely successful, having a workingman address the Zemstvo gentry would only achieve an external effect, andthat to talk of its really exerting “powerful” pressure on“the tactics of the liberal elements” is nothing but a joke?Is it not rather the other way round—that what has reallyexerted powerful pressure on the tactics of the liberal ele-ments is those mass workers’ demonstrations which to you are of the “ordinary, general-democratic, lower type”?And if the Russian proletariat is destined again to exert effective pressure on the tactics of the liberals, it will, I assure you, be by a mass onslaught against the government, not by an agreement with the Zemstvo-ists. 
 IV The Zemstvo campaign, launched with the gracious permission of the police; the blandishments of Svyatopolk-Mirsky159 and the government press; the rising tone of the liberal press; the animation in what is known aseducated society—all this faces the workers’ party with veryserious tasks indeed. 
 But these tasks are quite wronglyformulated in the letter of the Iskra editors. 
 At this of all times, the political activity of the proletariat must be focused on organising powerful pressure on the govern-ment, not on the liberal opposition. 
 Particularly now,agreements between the workers and the Zemstvo-ists aboutpeaceful demonstrations—agreements which would inevitablyboil down to the staging of musical-comedy effects—areutterly out of place; what is needed is to rally the ad-vanced, revolutionary elements of the proletariat in prepara-tion for a decisive struggle for freedom. 
 Particularly now,when our constitutional movement is beginning conspicu-ously to display the original sins of all bourgeois liber-alism, and notably the Russian variety—phrase-mongering,inconsistency of word and action, a sheerly philistine disposition to trust the government and every adroit politi-cian—talk about the undesirability of frightening andpanicking the Zemstvo gentry, about levers for reaction,etc. 
, etc. 
, is especially out of place. 
 Particularly now, it isvital to build up in the revolutionary proletariat the firmconviction that the present “emancipation movement in society” will necessarily and inevitably prove a bubble like all the others before it unless the force of the worker masses,capable of and ready for an uprising, intervenes. 
 The political unrest among all sections of the people— that essential condition for an uprising and earnest of itssuccess, an earnest that the initiative of the proletariat will meet with support—is spreading, growing, becoming more intense all the time. 
 It would therefore be very poorjudgement if at this moment anyone were to start shouting again for immediate launching of the assault, for forming at once into assault battalions,160 etc. 
 The whole course of events goes to show that the tsarist government will very soon find itself in a still worse tangle and faced withan even more formidable resentment. 
 The game it has startedwith the Zemstvo constitutionalists is bound to get it intoa tangle: whether it makes some paltry concessions orwhether it makes no concessions at all, discontent and exasperation will inevitably spread still wider. 
 And it is likewise bound to get into a tangle with its shameful andcriminal Manchurian adventure, which spells a politicalcrisis in either event: decisive military defeat, or the pro-traction of a war so hopeless for Russia. 
 What the working class must do is to broaden and strengthen its organisation and redouble its agitation among the masses, making the most of every vacillation of the gov-ernment, propagating the idea of an uprising, demonstratingthe necessity for it from the example of all those half-hearted and foredoomed “steps” about which so much fussis now being made. 
 It need hardly be said that the workers’ response to the Zemstvo petitions must be to call meetings, scatter leaflets, and—where there are forces enough—orga-nise demonstrations to present all the Social-Democraticdemands, regardless of the “panic” of Mr. 
 Trubetskoy andhis like or of the philistines’ cries about levers for reaction. 
And if one is really to risk talking in advance, and from abroad at that, about a possible and desirable higher type of mass demonstration (because demonstrations not of a mass nature are altogether without significance); if one is reallyto discuss before what particular premises the demonstra-tors’ forces should be concentrated—we would point to thepremises where the business of police persecution of the work-ing-class movement is carried on, to the police, gendarmer-ie, censorship headquarters, to the places where political“offenders” are confined. 
 The way for the workers to giveserious support to the Zemstvo petitions is not by concludingagreements about the conditions on which the Zemstvo-istswould have a right to speak in the name of the people, but by striking a blow at the people’s enemies. 
 And there need be little doubt that the idea of such a demonstration willmeet with the sympathy of the proletariat. 
 The workers now-adays hear magniloquent phrases and lofty promises on every hand, they see a real—infinitesimal but nonetheless real— extension of freedom for “society” (a slackening of the curb on the Zemstvos, the return of banished Zemstvo-ists, anabatement of the ferocity against the liberal press); but theysee nothing whatever that gives their political struggle more freedom. 
 Under pressure of the revolutionary onslaught ofthe proletariat the government has allowed the liberals to talk a little about freedom! The condition of the slaves of capital, downtrodden and deprived of rights, now comeshome to the proletarians more clearly than ever. 
 The workersdo not have any regular widespread organisations for therelatively free (by Russian standards) discussion of politicalmatters; nor halls to hold meetings in; nor newspapers of their own; and their exiled and imprisoned comrades are not coming back. 
 The workers see now that the liberalbourgeois gentry are setting about dividing the bearskin,the skin of the bear which the workers have not yet killed,but which they, and they alone, have seriously wounded. 
They see that, at the very start of dividing the skin in antici-pation, these liberal bourgeois gentry already snap and snarl at the “extreme parties”, at the “enemies at home”—the relentless enemies of bourgeois rule and bourgeois lawand order. 
 And the workers will rise still more fearlesslyin still greater numbers, to finish off the bear, to win by forcefor themselves what is promised as charity to the liberal bourgeois gentry—freedom of assembly, freedom of the workers’ press, full political freedom for a broad and openstruggle for the complete victory of socialism. 
 We are issuing this pamphlet with the superscription “For Party Members Only” inasmuch as the Iskra editors’ “letter” was issued with that superscription. 
 Actually, tostage “secrecy precautions” in regard to a plan that is tobe circulated to dozens of towns, discussed in hundreds ofworkers’ circles, and explained in agitation leaflets andappeals is nothing short of ridiculous. 
 It is an instance of the bureaucratic mystification which Comrade Galyorka, in “On the New Road”, has already noted to be a practiceof the editors and the Council. 
 There is just one angle from which one might justify concealing the editorial letter from the public in general and the liberals in particular: a letter like that is altogether too discreditable to our Party.... 
 We are cancelling the superscription restricting the readership of this pamphlet, since our so-called Party edi-torial board has issued a reply to it that is supposedly for the Party membership but is in fact circulated only to gath-erings of the minority and withheld from Party membersknown to belong to the majority. 
 If Iskra has decided not to consider us Party members (while at the same time fearing to say so openly), we can only resign ourselves to our sad fate and draw the appro-priate conclusions from that decision.

 Already at the Second Congress the minority Iskra -ists displayed instability of principle (or went astray)and in the elections found themselves in coalition withtheir ideological opponents.

 After the Congress too—even at the League—the minority championed the continuity of the old Iskra but actually shifted further and further away from it. 
 3. 
 Plekhanov at the time of his swing-over (No. 
 52) saw clearly that the minority constituted the opportunist wingof the Party and were fighting like anarchistic individu-alists.

 Defending, justifying, elevating to a principle our organisational backwardness and the organisational nul-lification of the Congress already constitutes opportunism. 
No one will today venture to support, as such, theses onprogramme versus Rules, etc. 
 5. 
 To accuse the majority of ignoring the economic strug-gle, of Jacobinism, of ignoring the workers’ independent initiative, is nothing but totally groundless repetition ofthe attacks of Rabocheye Dyelo on Iskra .

 Fear of the Third Congress and opposition to it completes the false position of both the minority and theconciliators.

 The campaign plan is connected with Starover’s mis-taken resolution. 
 Written on November 19 (December 2), 1904 First published in 1931 Published according in Lenin Miscellany XVI to the manuscript     A LETTER TO THE COMRADES (WITH REFERENCE TO THE FORTHCOMING PUBLICATION OF THE ORGAN OF THE PARTY MAJORITY) Dear Comrades, Today, at a meeting of a close circle of Bolsheviks abroad, a final decision was taken on a question that inprinciple has long been decided: the publication of a Partyperiodical that will uphold and develop the principles ofthe majority against the organisational and tactical discordbrought into the Party by the minority, and will serve the needs of the positive work of the organisations in Russia, against whom such a bitter fight is now being carriedon by minority agents practically all over the country—afight that terribly disorganises the Party at this vital his-torical juncture, and one that is carried on throughout bythe most shameless splitting methods and tactics, amid hypocritical deploring of the split by the so-called Central Organ of the Party. 
 We have done everything in our powerto steer the struggle into a Party channel; ever since Januarywe have been fighting for a congress, as the only worthyParty way to end this impossible situation. 
 By now itis perfectly clear that the activities of the Central Committee following its desertion to the minority consist almost entirely in desperately resisting a congress, and thatthe Council is resorting to the most outrageous and unpar-donable tricks to put off convening it. 
 The Council isdirectly sabotaging a congress; whoever has still to be con-vinced of that after its latest decisions, printed in the sup-plement to Nos. 
 73-74 of Iskra , will see it from Orlovsky’s pamphlet The Council Against the Party , 162 which we published the other day. 
 It is perfectly clear now that unless they unite and resist our so-called central institutions, the majority will not be able to uphold their position, to uphold the party spirit in its struggle against the circle spirit. 
 Union of the Bolsheviks in Russia has long been put forward bythem as an urgent need. 
 Recall the tremendous sympathet-ic response to the programmatic resolution of the twenty-two * (programmatic for our struggle within the Party); recall the proclamation of the nineteen, issued in printed form by the Moscow Committee (October 1904); lastly, nearly all Party committees are aware that a number of privateconferences of majority committees have lately been held,and in part are still being held, 163 and that the most vigorous and definite efforts are being made to solidly unitethe majority committees for resistance to the overweening Bonapartists on the Council, Central Organ, and Central Committee. 
 We hope that these efforts (or rather steps) will be made generally known in the very near future, when the resultswill allow of a definite statement of what has already beenachieved. 
 It need hardly be said that the majority would have been quite unable to conduct their self-defence without a publishing house of their own. 
 As you may already knowfrom our Party literature, the new Central Committee simp-ly ejected our pamphlets (and even the covers of pamph-lets already set up) from the Party printing office, thusturning the latter into the printing office of a circle, and refused the direct request of the majority members abroad and of committees in Russia—the Riga Committee, forinstance—to have majority literature delivered to Russia. 
It became quite evident that falsification of Party opinionwas a systematic tactic of the new Central Committee. 
 Wefound ourselves faced unavoidably with the necessity of expanding our publishing activities and setting up our own transport arrangements. 
 The committees that had brokenoff comradely relations with the editorial board of theCentral Organ (see Dan’s admission in his account of theGeneva meeting of September 2, 1904 164—an interesting pamphlet) could not and cannot do without a periodical organ. 
 A party without an organ, an organ without a party! *See pp. 
 454-61 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 This tragic formulation put forward by the majority as far back as August inexorably decreed the one solution—the starting of our own organ. 
 The young literary forces that have been coming abroad to uphold the vital cause of themajority of the comrades in Russia need a field for theirenergies. 
 A number of Party writers in Russia likewisecall insistently for an organ. 
 In starting this organ, whichwill probably be called Vperyod , we are acting in full agreement with the mass of the Bolsheviks in Russia, and in full harmony with our conduct in the Party struggle. 
We are resorting to this weapon after a whole year spentin trying every, absolutely every way that is simpler,more economical for the Party, more perfectly in accordancewith the interests of the working-class movement. 
 We are by no means abandoning the struggle for a congress; on the contrary, we want to extend, co-ordinate, and support thisstruggle, want to help the committees to decide the newquestion now facing them—that of arranging a congress with-out the Council and Central Committee, and against thewishes of the Council and Central Committee—a question that requires the fullest and most serious discussion. 
 We openly champion views and aims that have long since beenstated, in a number of pamphlets, before the whole Party. 
We are fighting and will continue to fight for the consis-tent revolutionary line, against discord and wabbling inmatters of both organisation and tactics (see the monstrous-ly muddled letter of the new Iskra to the Party organisa-tions, printed for Party members only and concealed fromthe eyes of the world 165). 
 The announcement about the new organ will probably appear in a week or so, and the firstissue somewhere between January 1 and 10, New Style. 
 Theeditorial board will include all the majority writers that have so far come to the fore (Ryadovoy, Galyorka, Lenin, Orlovsky, who contributed regularly to Iskra from its 46th to 51st issue, when it was conducted by Lenin andPlekhanov, and also very valuable younger forces). 
 Thebody practically directing and organising the complex busi-ness of distribution, agencies, etc. 
, etc. 
, will be formed (has already been formed in part) 166 through direct assign-ment of definite functions to definite comrades by a numberof Russian committees (the Odessa, Ekaterinoslav, and Niko-layev committees, the four Caucasian committees, and several northern ones, more particulars of which you will receive shortly). 
 We now appeal to all comrades to give us all the support they can. 
 We shall conduct the organ on the under-standing that it is the organ of the movement in Russia, notof any émigré circle. 
 This requires, first and foremost,the most vigorous “ literary ” support, or rather literary participation, from Russia. 
 I have put the word “literary” in italics and inverted commas in order to draw attention from the first to its special sense and caution against a mis-conception that is very common and highly detrimentalto the work. 
 It is a misconception that writers and onlywriters (in the professional sense of the term) can success-fully contribute to a publication; on the contrary, it will be vital and alive only if for five leading and regularly contributing writers there are five hundred or five thousandcontributors who are not writers. 
 One of the shortcomingsof the old Iskra , one which I always tried to rid it of (and which has grown to monstrous proportions in the new Iskra ) was that too little was done for it from Russia. 
 We always used to print everything, practically without exception, that we received from Russia. 
 A really live organ shouldprint only a tenth of what it receives, using the rest as ma-terial for the information and guidance of the journalists. 
We must have as many Party workers as possible correspondwith us, correspond in the ordinary, not the journalistic sense of the term. 
 Isolation from Russia, the engulfing atmosphere of the accursed émigré slough, weighs so heavily on one here thatliving contact with Russia is our only salvation. 
 Let all re-member that who want in fact, and not just in word, to consid-er (and to make ) our organ the organ of the entire “majority”, the organ of the mass of Russian comrades. 
 Let everyone who regards this organ as his own and who is consciousof the duties of a Social-Democratic Party member abandononce and for all the bourgeois habit of thinking and actingas is customary towards legally published papers—thehabit of feeling: it is their business to write and ours to read. 
 All Social-Democrats must work for the Social-Democratic paper. 
 We ask everyone to contribute, and especially theworkers. 
 Give the workers the widest opportunity to write for our paper, to write about positively everything, to write as much as they possibly can about their daily lives, interests, and work—without such material a Social-Demo-cratic organ will not be worth a brass farthing and will notdeserve the name. 
 In addition, please send us private letters , not intended as contributions to the paper, i. 
e. 
, not forpublication, but by way of comradely intercourse with theeditors and to keep them informed, and not only about facts and incidents, but about the prevailing sentiment and the everyday, “uninteresting”, humdrum, routine side of themovement. 
 People who have not lived abroad cannot imag-ine how much we need such letters (there is absolutely noth-ing secret about them either, and to write such an uncodedletter once or twice a week is really something the busiest person can do). 
 So write to us about the discussions at the workers’ study circles, the nature of these discussions, thesubjects of study, and the things the workers ask about;about the state of propaganda and agitational work, andabout contacts among the general public, in the army, andamong the youth; above all write about any dissatisfaction the workers feel with us Social-Democrats, about the things that trouble them, about their suggestions, criticisms, etc. 
Matters relating to the practical organisation of the work areparticularly interesting now, and there is no way of acquaint-ing the editors with them except by a lively correspondencenot of a journalistic nature, but simply of a comradely kind. 
 Of course, not everyone has the ability or inclination to write, but ... don’t say “I can’t”, say “I don’t want to”;given the desire, one or two comrades who could write canbe found in any circle, any group, even the smallest, eventhe most minor (the minor groups are often especially in-teresting, for they sometimes do the most important, though inconspicuous, part of the work). 
 We here have from the start placed the secretarial work on a broad footing, draw-ing on the experience of the old Iskra ; and you for your part should know that anybody , absolutely anybody who sets about it with patience and determination can without muchdifficulty make sure that all his letters, or nine-tenths of them, reach their destination. 
 I say this on the basis of the three years’ experience of the old Iskra , which had many such an informal correspondent (often unacquainted /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR with any of the editors) who wrote with the utmost regularity. 
 The police have long been quite unequal to the task of intercepting all foreign correspondence (they only seize a letter occasionally, if the writer has been unusually care-less); and the great bulk of the old Iskra ’s material always used to arrive in the most usual way, in ordinary letterssent to our addresses. 
 A special word of warning against thepractice of concentrating correspondence only in the hands of the committee and the secretaries. 
 Nothing could be more harmful than such a monopoly. 
 Essential as unity isin actions and decisions, in the matter of general informa-tion, of correspondence, it is quite wrong. 
 It very oftenhappens that the most interesting letters are from compara-tive “outsiders” (people more remote from the committees), who perceive more freshly much that old experienced workers overlook because they are too used to it. 
 Give everyopportunity to the younger people to write to us—to theyouth, to Party workers, to “centralists”, to organisers, andto ordinary rank-and-filers at impromptu meetings and massrallies. 
 Only given such a wide correspondence can we, by our joint efforts, make our paper a real organ of the working-class movement in Russia . 
 We earnestly request, to have this letter read to every kind of meeting, study circle,subgroup, etc. 
, etc. 
—as widely as possible—and to beinformed how the workers receive this appeal. 
 As to the idea of publishing a separate workers’ (“popular”) organ and a general—guiding—intellectual organ, we are verysceptical about it; we should like to see the Social-Demo-cratic newspaper the organ of the whole movement, to seethe workers’ paper and the Social-Democratic paper fusedin one. 
 This can be achieved only if we have the most active support of the working class. 
 With comradely greetings, N. 
 Lenin Written on November 29 (December 12), 1904 Published in leaflet form Published according in December 1904 to the leaflet text STATEMENT AND DOCUMENTS ON THE BREAK OF THE CENTRAL INSTITUTIONS WITH THE PARTY Written in December 1904 First published in 1926 Published according in Lenin Miscellany V to the pamphlet text In No. 
 77 of Iskra , three members of the Central Com-mittee, claiming to act on behalf of that body as a whole,summon Comrade N 167 to a court of arbitration on the charge of “making a false statement designed to disrupt theParty”. 
 The allegedly false statement in question was made “through a member of the Central Committee who took no part in drawing up the declaration”, that is, through me. 
In view of my close connection with the affair, and actingon the authority of Comrade N, I consider it my right andduty to participate in the arbitration proceedings, and Ibring the following charges against Central Committee members Glebov, Valentin, and Nikitich. 
 I charge them with unlawful, improper, formally and mor-ally impermissible behaviour towards their fellow-membersof the Central Committee and towards the Party as a whole. 
 Inasmuch as this improper behaviour is greatly protract-ing and aggravating the Party crisis, and as it moreover directly affects the mass of the Party workers, I consider publicity of the proceedings absolutely essential in regardto everything that does not affect the secrecy of the organi-sation, and I shall therefore set forth my charges in detail. 
 I. 
I charge the three Central Committee members , Glebov , Valentin , and Nikitich , with systematically deceiving the Party . 
 1) I charge them with having used the powers conferred on them by the Second Party Congress to suppress the publicopinion of the Party as expressed in the agitation for aThird Congress. 
 They had no right to suppress this agita-tion, which is an inalienable right of every Party member. 
 In particular, they had no right to dissolve the Southern Bureau for agitating on behalf of a congress. 
 They hadneither the formal nor the moral right to censure me, a mem-ber of the Party Council, for having voted in the Council in favour of a congress. 
 2) I charge them with having concealed from the Party the committee resolutions in favour of a congress, and withtaking advantage of the confidence they enjoy as members ofone of the Party’s highest institutions to mislead thecommittees by a deliberately false account of the state ofaffairs in the Party. 
 They have obstructed the elucidation of the truth by refusing to meet the Riga Committee’s request to have the resolution of the twenty-two printed anddistributed and to have majority literature delivered toRussia, on the pretext that it is not Party literature. 
 3) I charge them with not having hesitated, in their agitation against a congress, even to disrupt the work on the spot by appealing against the pro-congress commit-tees to their peripheral organisations, doing everything todiscredit these committees in the eyes of the local workers,and thus tending to destroy that confidence between thecommittees and their periphery without which all work isimpossible. 
 4) I charge them with having, through the Central Committee delegate on the Council, shared in devising theCouncil rulings as to the conditions for summoning the ThirdCongress—rulings which made a congress impossible andthus deprived the Party of the opportunity of settling the,conflict within it in a normal way. 
 5) I charge them with having told the committees that they agreed in principle with the position of the majorityand that any agreement with the minority was only possibleif the latter gave up its secret separate organisation andits demand for co-optation to the Central Committee, yethaving at the same time, in secret from the Party and in deliberate defiance of its will , made a deal with the minority on the following terms: 1) preservation of the autonomyof the minority’s technical enterprises, and 2) co-optationto the Central Committee of three of the most inveterateminority adherents. 
 6) I charge them with having taken advantage of their authority as members of one of the Party’s highest insti-tutions to cast aspersions on their political opponents. 
They have behaved dishonourably towards Comrade P. 
 168 in resolving last July on an investigation into his alleged false statement to the Northern Committee and to this day (December 22) not even presenting him with the charges made against him, although Glebov has met P. 
 several times,and although this same Glebov, in his capacity of memberof the Party Council, allowed himself to apply the term“deceit” in Iskra to the action of this comrade, who had no opportunity to defend himself. 
 They told a deliberate untruth when they declared that Lidin 169 was not a rep-resentative ( Vertrauensmann ) of the Central Committee. 
 They deceived the Party members, with the object of dis-crediting in their eyes Comrade Bonch-Bruyevich and hisassociates in the Distribution Centre, by publishing astatement in Iskra (No. 
 77) in which only the liabilities of the Distribution Centre were shown (and that inaccu-rately)—and this after they had, through their representa-tives, issued Comrade Bonch-Bruyevich a written certificateto the effect that he had conducted the business properly andthat the accounts were in good order. 
 7) I charge them with having taken advantage of the absence of Comrade Vasilyev and Comrade Zverev, the former foreign representatives of the Central Committee, todiscredit Party institutions (the library and archives of theR. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 in Geneva). 
 They published a statement inIskra , signed by a Central Committee “representative” un-known to me, in which the history and true character of these institutions was absolutely distorted. 
 II. 
In addition , I charge the three members of the Central Committee , Glebov , Valentin , and Nikitich , with a number of morally and formally impermissible actions towards fellow-members of that body . 
 1) They violated every principle of Party organisation and discipline by presenting me (through Comrade Glebov) with an ultimatum to resign from the Central Committeeor cease agitating for a congress. 
 2) They broke the agreement concluded in their name by Central Committee member Glebov, when, as a result of thealtered composition of the Central Committee, it was no longer to their advantage to observe this agreement. 
 3) They had no right, at their meeting in July, to declare Comrade N as having resigned from the Central Committee without hearing either his statement or mine, particularly as these three members of the Central Committee were aware of our demand (the demand of four Central Com-mittee members170) to have this disputed matter examined at a general meeting of the Central Committee. 
 To declareComrade N no longer a member of the Central Committeewas also impermissible in itself, for in doing so the threeCentral Committee members took improper advantage of a statement which Comrade N had made conditionally (and of which not all the comrades had been informed). 
 4) The three Central Committee members had no right to conceal from me the change in-their views and intentions. 
Comrade Glebov assured me at the end of May that theirviews were expressed in the declaration they had drawn up in March. 
 171 Thus the July declaration, which conflicts basically with the March declaration, was adopted in secretfrom me, and Glebov’s statements were a piece of deception. 
 5) Glebov broke the agreement he had made with me that in the report to the Amsterdam Congress, 172 which was to be written by Dan (as delegate from the Central Organ) and himself, Glebov (as delegate from the Central Committee), there would be no reference to the differences in the Party. 
The report, which was written by Dan alone, proved to befull of veiled controversy and permeated through and throughwith the views of the “minority”. 
 Glebov did not protestagainst Dan’s report, and thus indirectly shared in this attempt to deceive the international Social-Democratic movement. 
 6) The three Central Committee members had no right to deny me the opportunity to announce and publish my dis-senting opinion on an important issue of Party life. 
 TheJuly declaration was sent to the Central Organ for publica-tion before I had been given a chance to express an opinion about it. 
 On August 24, I sent the Central Organ a protestagainst this declaration. 
 The Central Organ declared thatit would print it only if so desired by the three CentralCommittee members who had written the declaration. 
 Theydid not so desire, and thus they concealed my protest from the Party. 
 7) They had no right to withhold from me the minutes of the Council and to deprive me, without formally expel-ling me from the Central Committee, of all information about what was happening in the Central Committee, about the appointment of new agents in Russia and abroad, the negotiations with the “minority”, the state of the Partyfunds, etc. 
, etc. 
 8) They had no right to co-opt three new comrades (con-ciliators) to the Central Committee without taking thematter to the Council, as required by the Party Rules in the absence of unanimity; and there was no unanimity, since I had lodged a protest against the co-optation. 
 Appendix In view of the importance attaching to the position of the Central Committee in the conflict within the Party, I deem it necessary to publish the following documents.

Letters from Comrade Glebov to members of the “col-legium ”. 
173 a) September. 
 “Relations with the Central Organ and the League have not been settled yet. 
 I must say that since our declaration they have becomeimpudent and their appetites have been growing. 
 Our position hereis very difficult: control of things abroad is in the hands of the League, private sources are in the hands of the Central Organ, and so we are up to our ears in debt. 
 In these straits (with a debt of 9,000 roundour necks), I have to think about finding some solution. 
 I have there-fore asked the minority to let me have an outline of their desiredreforms. 
” b) September 7. 
 “Last night I had a business meeting, in the presence of S. 
, with three spokesmen of the minority: Popov, Blumenfeld, and Martov. 
” Of the questions discussed at this meeting, which, in Glebov’s words, turned into “a preliminary meeting for thearrangement of peace”, let me mention the following: 1) Organisational relations abroad. 
 “Responsibility for the movement in Russia to be assumed by the Central Committee, the Central Organ, and the League. 
 With a viewto removing mutual friction and creating a greater interest in the work and complete confidence, the general direction of affairs to be entrusted to a commission of representatives of the Central Committee,the Central Organ, and the League. 
 The Central Committee to havetwo votes and the right of veto.... 
” 2) Transport. 
 “The Central Organ to come under the Central Committee’s con-trol with a certain amount of autonomy, as follows: There must only be one distribution centre abroad, the Central Committee’s. 
 Butthe Central Organ is to keep charge of its own part of the border. 
 Liter-ature distribution in Russia to be in the Central Committee’s hands. 
To give it greater autonomy, however, the Central Organ is to havecharge of the South. 
 Let me explain. 
 The Central Organ has its own transport arrangements It fears that in the event of a change of admin-istration it might be deprived of its routes. 
 It therefore requests to beguaranteed them by organisational means. 
” c) September 7. 
 “Dan and possibly others here too are furious over yesterday’s agreement as to the management of affairs. 
 What a greedy lot! Whatthey would like is to set up abroad a committee of representatives ofthe Central Organ, the Central Committee, and the League, which would decide everything abroad-each only to have one vote, of course. 
 Not bad, eh?” d) September. 
 “I want to draw your attention to the desire the Council has ex-pressed for replenishment [this refers to replenishment of the CentralCommittee representation on the Council]. 
 Somebody will have tobe elected in place of Lenin, who will, of course, proclaim it unlawful. 
I would suggest Dan or Deutsch—with the express proviso that they are being appointed only for the purpose of representation on the Council. 
 There is nobody else we can elect, it seems to me. 
” II. 
 Letter from a Central Committee agent (now officially co-opted to the Central Committee ) to Comrade Glebov : September 4. 
 “Over the declaration there’s such a to-do that it’s hard to sort things out. 
 The one thing that’s clear is that all the committees except the Kharkov, Crimea, Mining Area, and Don are majority committees. 
The Don Committee is neutral, I think, but I don’t know for certain. 
Of the ‘majority’ committees, the Riga, Moscow, St. 
 Petersburg, andNorthern have, as I informed you before, expressed lack of confidencein the Central Committee on account of the declaration. 
 Full confidence in it has been expressed by only a very few committees. 
 The rest have expressed confidence in it as regards attempts at reconciliation—withthe proviso that if these should fail a special congress is to be called immediately. 
 Of these last-named committees, some make it a con-dition of reconciliation that the minority should cease to regard them-selves as a ‘contracting party’ and abandon their demand for co-opta-tion as a ‘contracting party’(?). 
 That is the picture. 
 If the reconciliationdoesn’t come off, the Central Committee forfeits the confidence of the majority of the committees and will, consequently itself be obliged to agitate for a congress in order to surrender its mandate. 
 And the committees’ frame of mind makes it quite clear that a congress would pass decisions along the lines proposed by the twenty two , viz. 
, to dismiss the editors and hand over the editorship to the majority , to reform the party Council , etc. 
 But, as I have already told you, if the reconcilia-tion is to satisfy the committees, the minority must accept the declara-tion and cease to regard themselves as a ‘contracting party’. 
 If theydo that, I think Lenin will lose all support in Russia and it will be possible to restore peace. 
 Your remark that matters with Martov are straightening out ‘little by little’ surprised me. 
 The editors’ ob-stinacy is becoming positively exasperating, and in spite of my sympa-thies for them ideologically and otherwise, I am beginning to lose confidence in them as political ‘leaders’. 
 They now have the organi-sational question cleared up, and if they persist in their obstinacy in the absence of support from Russia (the minority are powerless here) , it will show that they are only fighting for posts. 
” That was the beginning of the bargain; and here is the finale. 
 The Central Committee circulated a letter to the commit-tees informing them that “The negotiations will be completed very shortly (in a couple of weeks at the outside), and meanwhile we can inform you that (1) theCentral Committee has not co-opted any minority members (somebody is circulating a slander to that effect); ... (3) the negotiations with the minority are being conducted precisely along the lines that Valentinreported to you, namely, that if there are to be any concessions, they can only be on the part of the minority and must consist in the Cen-tral Organ abandoning factional controversy and in the minority dis-solving their secret organisation, renouncing their demand for co-optation to the Central Committee, and turning over all their enter-prises (technical equipment, transport arrangements, contacts) tothe Central Committee. 
 Only on these conditions can peace be restored in the Party. 
 And there is reason to hope that is how it will be. 
 At all events if the minority should now evince a desire to continuetheir old policy, the Central Committee will immediately break off the negotiations and proceed to summon a special congress. 
” That is how the Central Committee tried to soothe the committees, which expressed lack of confidence in it; andhere are some letters of “prominent ” members of the minor-ity. 
 The letters were received in the middle of December 1904, Old Style. 
 “At last we have had a meeting with the riffraff. 
 Their reply was as follows: they agree to autonomy for our technical enterprises; but as regards the agitation commission, they object, considering that to be a direct function of the Central Committee (direction of agitation),and prefer reform of the Central Committee to this plan; however , they cannot co-opt officially just now , and propose instead the de facto (unofficial) co-optation of three members of the minority (Popov , Fomin , and Fischer) . 
 Naturally , X. 
 and I at once agreed , and henceforth the Menshevik opposition is officially dissolved . 
 It is a veritable load off our minds. 
 The entire Central Committee is to have a meeting withus in a day or two, after which we shall arrange a conference of the committees closest to us.... 
 “We are , of course , quite certain that we shall gain control of the Central Committee and direct it along the lines we want . 
 That will be all the easier since many of them already admit the correctness of the minority’s criticism on points of principle.... 
 In all the consistentfirm-liner committees (Baku, Odessa, Nizhni-Novgorod, and St. 
 Pe-tersburg) the workers are demanding the system of office by election. 
 That is a clear symptom that the firm-liners are in their death-agony. 
” Simultaneously with this another letter was received: “An agreement has been reached between ‘minority’ representa-tives and the Central Committee. 
 The representatives signed an under-taking. 
 But as there had been no canvass of the ‘minority’ first, the undertaking, not unnaturally, turned out not altogether satisfactory: it expresses ‘confidence’ in the Central Committee, instead of in itsunity policy; it speaks both of absorption in the Party and of terminat-ing our separate existence, whereas the latter alone would be suffi-cient. 
 Lastly, the undertaking does not contain the ‘credo’ of the‘minority’. 
 In view of this, it has been decided to have all the ‘minor-ity’ organisations pass a resolution containing the ‘credo’ and the amendments indicated, while of course recognising our representa-tives’ agreement with the Central Committee as valid. 
” * * * It is very likely that the individuals caught red-handed and exposed by these documents will, with their usual “moral sensitivity”, do their best to divert the Party’s attentionfrom the contents of the documents to the moral issue ofthe right to publish them. 
 I am certain that the Party willnot allow itself to be fooled, by this sleight-of-hand. 
 Ideclare that I take upon myself full moral responsibility for this exposure, and will give all necessary explanations to the court of arbitration that investigates the matter as awhole. 
 ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE FORMATION OF AN ORGANISING COMMITTEE AND THE CONVENING OF THE THIRD REGULAR CONGRESS OF THE RUSSIAN SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC LABOUR PARTY174 The severe crisis our Party has been experiencing for a year and a half, ever since the time of the Second Congress,has led to an inevitable and long-foreseen result: to a com-plete break of the central institutions with the Party. 
 We shall not recapitulate here the painful history of that crisis and repeat facts sufficiently dealt with in the Partypress, and in particular in numerous resolutions and state-ments by the committees in Russia and conferences of them. 
It is sufficient to state that the last such conference, theNorthern, in which the St. 
 Petersburg, Riga, Tver, Moscow, Northern, and Nizhni-Novgorod committees took part, elected a Bureau which it instructed to act as an Organis-ing Committee for the immediate convening of the ThirdRegular Congress of the Russian Social-Democratic LabourParty. 
 After waiting beyond all time limits set by the committees for an answer from the so-called Central Committee, the Bureau has come to an understanding with representativesof the three Southern (Odessa, Ekaterinoslav, and Nikolayev)and four Caucasian committees. 
 It is now coming forwardin the capacity of Organising Committee to convene theThird Regular Congress of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, without the consent of the central bodies, which are accountable to the Party but have shirked theirresponsibility to it. 
 This is a time of unprecedented political upsurge in Russia, and the proletariat is faced with immense historic tasks in the struggle against the autocracy. 
 All Social-Democrats working in Russia know what tremendous harmthe division within our Party has done to the work of organis-ing and rallying the forces of the proletariat; what infinitedamage the work of propaganda, agitation, and achieve-ment of workers’ unity in Russia has suffered through the pernicious influence of the émigré circle spirit. 
 And if it is not possible to unite the émigré circles and their placemen,let there be unity at least among all Social-DemocraticParty workers in Russia, all who uphold the consistentline of revolutionary Social-Democracy. 
 Their unificationis the only true road to complete and lasting unity in future among all Russian Social-Democrats. 
 Long live Russian, long live international revolutionary Social-Democracy! Concerning the arrangements for convening the Congress, the Organising Committee considers it necessary to make the following announcement: 1) The Organising Committee recognises the unqualified right to representation at the Third Regular Congress, withvoice and vote, of all Russian committees and organisationsendorsed by the Second Congress of the Russian Social-Demo-cratic Labour Party (the St. 
 Petersburg, Moscow, Kharkov, Kiev, Odessa, Nikolayev, Don, Ekaterinoslav, Saratov, Ural, Northern, Tula, Tver, Nizhni-Novgorod, Baku,Batum, Tiflis, Mining Area, Siberian, and Crimean com-mittees). 
 2) The Organising Committee recognises the conditional right to representation at the Congress of committees en-dorsed by the Central Committee after the Second Congress (the Mingrelian, Astrakhan, Orel-Bryansk, Samara, Smo-lensk, Riga, Kursk, and Voronezh committees, and alsothe League Abroad). 
 All these committees were endorsedby central bodies which have forfeited the confidence ofthe Party. 
 We are in duty bound to invite them to the Third Congress, but only the Congress itself can make the final decision as to their participation (actual status of the com-mittee, its right to voice only or to voice and vote, etc. 
). 
 3) On behalf of the majority of the Russian committees, the Organising Committee expresses the wish that all or-ganisations of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, both abroad and in Russia, and particularly all workers’organisations that consider themselves part of it, shouldbe represented at its Third Regular Congress. 
 The par-ticipation of the last-named appears to us especiallydesirable because the Party crisis and the demagogic preach-ing of office by election and of democracy à la Rabocheye Dyelo have already caused several splits. 
 We must take advantage of the Congress to try, with the participationof representatives from most of the Russian committees, toheal these splits or lessen the harm from them. 
 4) The Organising Committee accordingly invites all wishing to participate in the Congress to respond immedi-ately and communicate with it (through one of the thirteencommittees named above). 
 5) The question of invitation to the Congress shall in disputed cases be decided by the two nearest committeesand a third person representing the Organising Committee. 
 6) The terms of representation at the Congress (with voice only or with voice and vote) for committees and otherorganisations not endorsed by the Second Party Congressshall be determined by the Third Congress itself. 
 7) The time and place of the Congress will be fixed by the Organising Committee.

P. 
 , written at the time of the Bolsheviks’ bitter struggle against the disruptive,splitting activities of the Mensheviks after the Second Congress,played a big part in exposing the Mensheviks’ opportunist tacticsand rallying the supporters of the majority. 
 Until the publicationof the Congress minutes (in January 1904) it was the only Partydocument dealing with the results of the Second Congress and thecauses of the split in the Party. 
 The ideas contained in it werefurther developed in subsequent articles, letters, and speeches byLenin, and particularly in his book One Step Forward , Two Steps Back (pp. 
 201-423 of this volume) p. 
 15 Lenin here gives the figures of voting rights as they stood at the time of the Credentials Committee report at the second sittingof the Congress, on July 18 (31), 1903. 
 42 voting delegates hadarrived at the Congress by then: 33 with one vote each, 8 with twovotes each, and one of the two delegates from the Foreign Commit-tee of the Bund also had two votes temporarily, pending the arriv-al of the other. 
 After the arrival of this latter on July 22 (August4), there were 43 voting delegates, 35 of them with one vote eachand 8 with two.

 19 The Bund (General Jewish Workers’ Union of Lithuania, Poland, and Russia), founded at a congress of Jewish Social-Democraticgroups held in Vilno in 1897, was an association mainly of semi-proletarian Jewish artisans in Russia’s western regions. 
 It joinedthe R.

 at the First Congress (1898) “as an autonomousorganisation independent only in regard to questions specificallyconcerning the Jewish proletariat” ( The C. 
P. 
S. 
U. 
 in Resolutions and Decisions of Its Congresses , Conferences , and Plenary Meetings of the Central Committee , 1954, Part I, p. 
 14). 
 The Bund brought nationalist and separatist tendencies into the Russian working-class movement. 
 Its Fourth Congress, inApril 1901, voted to replace the autonomy relationship establishedby the First Congress of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 by a relationship basedon the federal principle. 
 This congress of the Bund also declared,in a resolution on methods of political struggle, that “the best wayto draw the broad masses into the movement is the economic strug-gle”.

L. 
P. 
 rejected its de-mand to be recognised as the sole representative of the Jewishproletariat, the Bund withdrew from the Party. 
 It rejoined in1906 on the basis of a decision of the Fourth (Unity) Congress. 
 Within the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
, the Bundists always supported the opportunist wing (the Economists, the Mensheviks, the Liquida-tors) and fought against the Bolsheviks and Bolshevism. 
 As againstthe Bolsheviks’ programme demand for the right of nationsto self-determination, they called for national cultural autonomy. 
During the First World War the Bund took a social-chauvinist stand. 
 In 1917 it supported the counter-revolutionary Provisional Government and fought on the side of the enemies of the GreatOctober Socialist Revolution. 
 In the years of foreign militaryintervention and civil war the Bund leadership joined forces withthe counter-revolution. 
 At the same time, the Bund rank andfile began to show a change of heart and favour co-operation with the Soviet government. 
 In March 1921 the Bund dissolved itself, part of its membership joining the Communist Party on the basisof the general rules of admission. 
 p. 
 19 Rabocheye Dyelo (Workers ’ Cause ) was an Economist journal, organ of the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad, published at irregular intervals in Geneva from April 1899 to February 1902 under the editorship of B. 
 N. 
 Krichevsky, P. 
 F. 
 Teplov (Sibiryak),V. 
 P. 
 Ivanshin, and later A. 
 S. 
 Martynov. 
 Nine issues (three ofthem double ones, thus making twelve) appeared in all. 
 The edi-torial board of Rabocheye Dyelo was the Economists’ centre abroad. 
 It supported Bernstein’s slogan of “freedom of criticism” of Marxism, took an opportunist stand on the tactical and organisational prob-lems of the Russian Social-Democratic movement, and denied therevolutionary potentialities of the peasantry. 
 The journal pro-pagated the opportunist idea of subordinating the workers’ politi-cal struggle to the economic and glorified spontaneity in the work-ing-class movement, denying the leading role of the Party. 
 One of its editors, V. 
 P. 
 Ivanshin, also took part in editing Rabochaya Mysl , organ of the avowed Economists, which Rabocheye Dyelo supported. 
 At the Second Congress of the R.

 p. 
 19 The Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad was founded in 1894 in Geneva, on the initiative of the Emancipation of Labourgroup. 
 The latter was at first the leader in it and edited its publica-tions, but afterwards the opportunist elements—the Economist“younger group”—secured the upper hand. 
 At the Union’s FirstCongress in November 1898 the Emancipation of Labour group refused to edit the Union publications; and at the Second Congress, in April 1900, it broke with the Union finally, withdrawing withits supporters from the Congress to establish an independent orga-nisation called Sotsial-Demokrat . 
p . 
 1 9 6 7The League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class , organised by Lenin in the autumn of 1895, embraced some twenty Marxist workers’ study circles in St. 
 Petersburg and was headed by a Central Group led by Lenin. 
 It was the first organisation in Russia to link up socialism with the working-class movement, going over from the propagation of Marxism among a small number of advanced workers to political agitation among the broad masses of the proletariat, it was significant because, as Lenin put it, it was the rudiment of a revolutionary party based on the working-class movement and directing the class struggle of the proletariat. 
 On the night of December 8 (20), 1895, the League was dealt a severe blow: many of the leading members, headed by Lenin, were arrested. 
 The first issue of its paper Rabocheye Dyelo (Workers ’ Cause ), all ready for the press, was also seized. 
 While in prison Lenin continued to direct the work of the League; he helped it with advice, smuggled out coded letters and leaflet texts, and wrote the pamphlet On Strikes (unfortunately not found so far) and his “Draft and Explanation of a Programme for the Social-Democratic Party” (present edition, Vol. 
 2, pp. 
 93-121). 
 Those of the old League members who escaped arrest helped to prepare and arrange the First Congress of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 and to draw up the Manifesto issued in its name. 
 However, the long absence of the League’s founders, who had been exiled to Siberia, and above all of Lenin, gave freer scope to the opportunist policies of the Economist “younger group” of Social-Democrats, who from 1897 on preached through their newspaper Rabochaya Mysl the ideas of mere trade unionism and Bernsteinism. 
 Beginning with the latter half of 1898 the leadership of the League was in the hands of the extreme Economists of the Rabochaya Mysl per-suasion. 
 p. 
 19 Yuzhny Rabochy (Southern Worker ) was a Social-Democratic group formed in the South of Russia in the autumn of 1900 around an illegal newspaper of that name (the first issue was published in January 1900 by the Ekaterinoslav Committee of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
, the twelfth and last—in April 1903). 
 Among the members of the group and the editors of the paper were, at various times, I. 
 K. 
 La-layants, A. 
 Vilensky, O. 
 A. 
 Kogan, B. 
 S. 
 Zeitlin, Y. 
 Y. 
 and Y. 
 S. 
 Levin, and V. 
 N. 
 Rozanov. 
 In contrast to the Economists, the Yuzhny Rabochy group con-sidered the proletariat’s political struggle, the overthrow of the autocracy, to be the prime task; they opposed terrorism, upheld the need to develop a mass revolutionary movement, and carried out extensive revolutionary activities in the South of Russia. 
 At the same time, they overestimated the role of the liberal bour-geoisie and ignored the importance of the peasant movement. 
 As against the Iskra plan of building a centralised Marxist party by uniting all revolutionary Social-Democrats around Iskra , the Yuzhny Rabochy group advocated a plan of restoring the Party by creating regional Social-Democratic associations. 
 A practical attempt to carry out this plan was made through convening in 8December 1901 a conference of the Party committees and organi-sations of the South, at which a League of Southern Committees and Organisations of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 was formed, with Yuzhny Rabochy as its press organ. 
 The attempt proved impracticable (as was the group’s entire organisational plan), and following whole-sale arrests in the spring of 1902, the League fell to pieces. 
 In August 1902 those Yuzhny Rabochy members who remained at liberty entered into negotiations with the Iskra editorial board about working together to restore Party unity. 
 The group’s state-ment of solidarity with Iskra (published in No. 
 27 of Iskra , November 1, 1902, and in No. 
 10 of Yuzhny Rabochy , December 1902) was of much importance in consolidating the Social-Demo-cratic forces. 
 In November 1902 Yuzhny Rabochy joined with the Iskra organisation in Russia and the St. 
 Petersburg Committee and Northern League of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 in establishing the Orga-nising Committee for convening the Second Party Congress, and they shared in that committee’s work. 
 But in this period too the group did not adhere to the consistent revolutionary line and evinced separatist tendencies (proposing, for example, to set up another all-Russia newspaper in addition to Iskra ). 
 Lenin classed Yuzhny Rabochy among the organisations “which, while verbally recognis-ing Iskra as the leading organ, actually pursued plans of their own and were unstable in matters of principle” (p. 
 209 of this volume). 
 At the Second Party Congress the Yuzhny Rabochy delegates adopted a “Centre” position (that of “middling opportu-nists”, as Lenin called the “Centre”). 
 The Second Party Congress voted to dissolve Yuzhny Rabochy , like all other separate, independently existing Social-Democratic groups and organisations. 
 p. 
 19 Iskra (The Spark ) was the first all-Russia illegal Marxist newspa-per, it was founded by Lenin in 1900, and it played a vital part in building the Marxist revolutionary party of the working class of Russia. 
 It was impossible to publish the paper in Russia on account of police persecution, and while still in exile in Siberia Lenin evolved a detailed plan for its publication abroad. 
 When his term of exile ended (January 1900) he at once set about putting his plan into effect. 
 In February he negotiated in St. 
 Petersburg with Vera Zasulich (who had come illegally from abroad) on the participation of the Emancipation of Labour group. 
 At the end of March and beginning of April, Lenin, Martov (Y. 
 O. 
 Zederbaum), A. 
 N. 
 Pot-resov, and S. 
 I. 
 Radchenko held a conference in Pskov with the “legal Marxists” P. 
 B. 
 Struve and M. 
 I. 
 Tugan-Baranovsky; this conference discussed Lenin’s draft declaration of the editorial board of the all-Russia newspaper ( Iskra ) and theoretical and poli-tical journal ( Zarya ) on the programme and aims of these publicat-ions. 
 Lenin also travelled to various cities (Moscow, St. 
 Peters-burg, Riga, Smolensk, Samara, Nizhni-Novgorod, Ufa, Syzran), establishing contacts with Social-Democratic groups and individ-ual Social-Democrats and obtaining their support for Iskra . 
 In August 1900, when Lenin arrived in Switzerland, he and Potre-sov held discussions with the Emancipation of Labour group on the programme and aims of Iskra and Zarya , on possible contribu-tors, and on the membership and location of the editorial board. 
 These negotiations very nearly ended in failure, but finally agree-ment was reached on all disputed questions. 
 The first issue of Lenin’s Iskra appeared in December 1900 in Leipzig; afterwards the paper was published in Munich, in London (from July 1902), and, beginning with the spring of 1903, in Geneva. 
 Considerable help in getting the paper going was afforded by the German Social-Democrats Clara Zetkin, Adolf Braun, and others, by the Polish revolutionary Julian Marchlewski, who was living in Munich at the time, and by Harry Quelch, one of the leaders of the British Social-Democratic Federation. 
 The editorial hoard of Iskra consisted of Lenin, G. 
 V. 
 Plekha-nov, Martov, P. 
 B. 
 Axelrod, Potresov, and Vera Zasulich. 
 Its secretary in the initial days was I. 
 G. 
 Smidovich-Leman; then, in the spring of 1901, the post was taken over by N. 
 K. 
 Krupskaya, who also conducted all Iskra ’s correspondence with the Social-Democratic organisations in Russia. 
 Lenin was actually editor-in-chief and the leading figure in Iskra . 
 His articles in it dealt with all major issues in the work of building the Party and in the class struggle of the Russian proletariat, as well as with important developments in world affairs. 
 Iskra became the centre around which the unification of the Party proceeded and Party forces were mustered and trained. 
 Party committees and groups adhering to Lenin’s Iskra line were formed in many places in Russia (St. 
 Petersburg, Moscow, Samara, and others), and a conference of Iskra -ists held in Samara in Janu-ary 1902 founded the Iskra Organisation in Russia. 
 The Iskra -ist organisations grew up and worked under the immediate leadership of Lenin’s associates and disciples—N. 
 E. 
 Bauman, I. 
 V. 
 Babush-kin, S. 
 I. 
 Gusev, M. 
 I. 
 Kalinin, G. 
 M. 
 Krzhizhanovsky, and others. 
 The paper played a decisive role in the fight for a Marxist party, in the defeat of the Economists and the unification of the scattered and isolated Social-Democratic circles. 
 On the initiative and with the immediate participation of Lenin the Iskra editorial board drafted the Party programme (the draft was published in Iskra , No. 
 21) and prepared the Second Party Congress, which was held in July-August 1903. 
 By the time of the Congress most of the local Social-Democratic organisations in Russia had associated themselves with Iskra , approved its pro-gramme, tactical line, and organisational plan, and recognised it as their leading organ. 
 A special resolution of the Congress noted Iskra ’s exceptional role in the struggle to build the Party and adopted the paper as the Central Party Organ. 
 The Congress ap-pointed an editorial board consisting of Lenin, Plekhanov, and Martov; but Martov, who insisted that all six of the old-editors should be retained, refused to serve on the board, in spite of the Congress decision, and Nos. 
 46-51 of Iskra were edited by Lenin and Plekhanov. 
 Subsequently Plekhanov went over to the Men-9 10 11 12 13sheviks and demanded the co-optation to the board of all the old Menshevik editors whom the Congress had rejected. 
 Lenin could not agree to this, and on October 19 (November 1), 1903, he resigned his editorship; he was co-opted to the Central Committee and struck at the Menshevik opportunists from this position. 
 Issue No. 
 52 of Iskra was edited by Plekhanov alone. 
 On November 13 (26), 1903, Plekhanov, acting on his own and in violation of the will of the Congress, co-opted all the Menshevik ex-editors to the editorial board. 
 Beginning with issue No. 
 52, Iskra became the organ of the Mensheviks.

 was originally elected at the Belostok Conference held in March (April) 1902, but soon after the conference all the committee members but one were arrested. 
 At Lenin’s suggestion, a new Organising Committee was set up at a conference of Social-Democratic committees held in November 1902 in Pskov. 
 On this committee the Iskra -ists had an overwhelming majority. 
 Under Lenin’s guidance, the Organising Committee carried out extensive preparatory work for the Second Congress. 
 Draft Regulations for the convening of the Congress were adopted at a plenary session held in Orel in February 1903. 
 Following this ple-nary session, members of the Organising Committee twice visited the local Party organisations with a view to assisting them in their work. 
 With their participation, the local committees discussed the draft Regulations, after which the Organising Committeefinally endorsed the Regulations and approved a list of the local organisations entitled under them to representation at the Con-gress. 
 The Organising Committee prepared for the Congress a detailed written report on its activities.

 Since it departed from Social-Democratic views and tactics, engaged in disorganising activities, and had no contacts with Social-Democratic organisations in Russia, the group was not allowed representation at the Second Party Congress. 
 It was dissolved by decision of that Congress.

 V. 
 Plekhanov in Geneva in 1883. 
 Apart from Plekhanov, the members were P.

 Axelrod, L. 
 G. 
 Deutsch, Vera Zasulich, and V. 
 N. 
 Ignatov. 
 The Emancipation of Labour group did a great deal for the propagation of Marxism in Russia. 
 They translated into Russian, published abroad, and distributed in Russia Marx’s and Engels’s Manifesto of the Communist Party , Marx’s Wage-Labour and Capi-tal, Engels’s Socialism : Utopian and Scientific , and other works of the founders of Marxism; their work dealt a severe blow to Narod-ism. 
 Plekhanov’s two drafts of a programme for Russian Social-Democrats, written in 1883 and 1885 and published by the group, were an important step towards the formation of a Social-Demo-cratic Party in Russia; and his essays Socialism and the Political Struggle (1883), Our Differences (1885), and The Development of the Monist View of History (1895) played a big part in spreading Marxist views. 
 At the same time, however, the Emancipation of Labour group were guilty of serious errors; they clung to certain remnants of Narodnik views, underestimated the revolutionary capacity of the peasantry, and overestimated the role of the liberal bourgeoisie. 
 These errors were the embryo of the future Menshevik views of Plekhanov and other members of the group. 
 The Eman-cipation of Labour group had no practical ties with the working-class movement. 
 Lenin pointed out that it “only founded Social-Democracy theoretically and took the first step in the direction of the working-class movement” (present edition, Vol. 
 20, “The Ideological Struggle in the Working-Class Movement”).

 28 The League of Russian Revolutionary Social-Democracy Abroad was founded in October 1901 on Lenin’s initiative, incorporating the Iskra -Zarya organisation abroad and the Sotsial-Demokrat organi-sation (which included the Emancipation of Labour group). 
 The objects of the League were to propagate the ideas of revolutionary Social-Democracy and help to build a militant Social-Democratic organisation. 
 Actually, the League was the foreign representative of the Iskra organisation. 
 It recruited supporters for Iskra among Social-Democrats living abroad, gave the paper material support, organised its delivery to Russia, and published popular Marxist literature. 
 The Second Party Congress endorsed the League as the sole Party organisation abroad, with the status of a Party committee and the obligation of working under the Central Commit-tee’s direction and control. 
 After the Second Party Congress, the Mensheviks entrenched them-selves in the League and used it in their fight against Lenin and the Bolsheviks. 
 At the Second Congress of the League, in October 1903, they adopted new League Rules that ran counter to the Party Rules adopted at the Party Congress. 
 From that time on the League was a bulwark of Menshevism. 
 It continued in existence until 1905.

 Four issues appeared. 
 The following articles by Lenin were published in Zarya : “Casual Notes”, “The Persecutors of the Zemstvo and the Hannibals of Liberalism”, the first four chapters of “The Agrarian Question and the ‘Critics of Marx’” (the Zarya title was “The ‘Critics’ on the Agrarian Question”), “Review of Home Affairs”, and “TheAgrarian Programme of Russian Social-Democracy”. 
 Zarya also printed theoretical articles by Plekhanov. 
 p. 
 31 The Party Council (1903-05), established under the Rules adopted by the Second Congress, was the supreme institution of the Party. 
 The Council was to co-ordinate and harmonise the activities of the Central Committee and the editorial board of the Central Organ, to restore either of these institutions in the event of its entire membership no longer being able to function, and to repre-sent the Party in relations with other parties. 
 Convening the Party Congress was also the function of the Council, and it was obligated by the Rules to do so at stated intervals or at the demand of Party organisations together entitled to half of the votes at the Congress. 
 The Council consisted of five members: two delegated by the Cen-tral Committee, two by the Central Organ, and the fifth elected by the Congress. 
 The fifth member elected at the Second Congress was Plekhanov. 
 Lenin was on the Council first as delegate of the Cen-tral Organ, then, after his resignation from the editorial board— as delegate of the Central Committee. 
 After Plekhanov swung over to the Menshevik opportunists and they captured the Central Organ, the Council became a weapon in their fight against the Bolsheviks. 
 Lenin battled consistently on the Council for Party unity, exposing the Mensheviks’ disruptive, splitting activities (pp. 
 143-85 and 433-41 of this volume). 
 Under the Rules adopted by the Third Party Congress, the Party Council was abolished.

 33 The Socialist-Revolutionaries (S. 
R. 
s) were a petty-bourgeois party formed in Russia at the end of 1901 and beginning of 1902 through the amalgamation of Narodnik groups and circles with the news-paper Revolutsionnaya Rossiya (Revolutionary Russia ; 1900-05) and the magazine Vestnik Russkoi Revolutsii (Herald of the Russian Revolution ; 1901-05) as its official organs. 
 The views of the Social-ist-Revolutionaries were an eclectic mixture of Narodism andrevisionism; they tried, as Lenin put it, to “mend the holes in Narodism” with “patches of the fashionable opportunist ‘criticism’ of Marxism” (see present edition, Vol. 
 9, “Socialism and the Peas-antry”). 
 They failed to see the class distinctions between proletar-iat and peasantry, glossed over the class differentiation and anta-gonisms within the peasantry, and rejected the leading role of the proletariat in the revolution. 
 The individual terrorism which they advocated as the principal means of fighting the autocracy did great harm to the revolutionary movement, for it interfered with organising the masses for revolutionary struggle. 
 The Socialist-Revolutionaries’ agrarian programme envisaged the abolition of private ownership of the land and its transfer to the village communes on the basis of equalised tenure, and also the development of co-operatives of all kinds. 
 There was nothing socialist in this programme of so-called “socialisation of the land”, since, as Lenin pointed out, abolition of private ownership of the land alone cannot end the domination of capital and the poverty of the masses. 
 The actual, and historically progressive, content of the Socialist-Revolutionary agrarian programme was a struggle for the abolition of landlordism; objectively that programme ex-pressed the interests and aspirations of the peasantry in the period of the bourgeois-democratic revolution. 
 The Bolsheviks exposed the Socialist-Revolutionaries’ attempts to masquerade as socialists, battled stubbornly with them for in-fluence over the peasantry, and showed how harmful their tactics of individual terrorism were to the working-class movement. 
 At the same time they were prepared, under certain conditions, to make temporary agreements with the Socialist-Revolutionaries in the struggle against tsarism. 
 The heterogeneous class character of the peasantry was respon-sible, in the final analysis, for political and ideological instability and organisational disunity among the Socialist-Revolutionaries and their constant vacillation between the liberal bourgeoisie and the proletariat. 
 There was a split in the Socialist-Revolution-ary Party already in the years of the first Russian revolution (1905-07): its Right wing formed the legal Labour Popular-Social-ist Party, akin in its views to the bourgeois Constitutional Demo-crats (Cadets); the “Left” wing took shape as the semi-anarchist Maximalist League. 
 During the years of reaction that followed the 1905-07 Revolution, the Socialist-Revolutionaries were in a state of complete ideological and organisational breakdown, and the First World War saw most of them adopt the standpoint of social-chauvinism. 
 After the victory of the February bourgeois-democratic revo-lution in 1917, the Socialist-Revolutionaries, together with the Mensheviks and Cadets, were the mainstay of the counter-revolu-tionary bourgeois-landlord Provisional Government, of which leaders of the party (Kerensky, Avksentyev, Chernov) were mem-bers. 
 In face of the revolutionary spirit of the peasantry the “Left” wing of the party founded at the end of November 1917 an independent Left Socialist-Revolutionary Party and, in an effort to maintain their influence among the peasant masses, formally recognised the Soviet government and entered into an agreement with the Bolsheviks; but as the class struggle in the countryside 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28developed, they set out to fight Soviet power. 
 During the years of foreign military intervention and civil war, the Socialist-Revolutionaries actively supported the interventionists and white-guard generals, engaged in counter-revolutionary subversion and plotting, and organised terrorist acts against Soviet leaders. 
 After the civil war, they continued their anti-Soviet activities within the country and as whiteguard émigrés abroad.

 66 The Second Congress of the League of Russian Revolutionary Social-Democracy Abroad was held in Geneva on October 13-18 (26-31), 1903; it was called at the insistence of the Mensheviks. 
 Fifteen of the delegates (with 18 votes) were majority adherents, headed by Lenin; 18 delegates (22 votes) were minority adherents; and one delegate (with two votes) belonged to neither majority nor minority. 
 The main item on the agenda was the report by Lenin, who had been the League’s delegate at the Second Party Congress. 
 A co-report was then made by Martov, who defended the opportun-ism of the Mensheviks and indulged in calumnious attacks upon the Bolsheviks. 
 Lenin and his supporters thereupon withdrew from the Congress. 
 For refusal to submit to the decisions of the Second Party Congress, the Central Committee and the Party Council pronounced the League Congress unlawful.

 Even before the paper began pub-lication and during the first year of its existence (December 1900-December 1901), a network of Iskra “agents” (P.

 Babushkin, and others) was set up in various parts of the country, and in a number of towns (St. 
 Petersburg, Pskov, Samara, Poltava, and others), groups for assistance to Iskra were formed. 
 These groups and agents collected funds for the paper, acted as its correspondents, arranged for its transport and distri-bution, and set up facilities for reprinting it in Russia. 
 During this period, however, they had little contact with each other and for the most part communicated directly with the editorial board. 
 But as the revolutionary movement mounted and the volume of practical work increased, it became essential to concert their efforts, to work on planned and organised lines to counter the pa-rochial amateurishness which the Economists were fostering and win the Social-Democratic committees to Iskra ‘s side. 
 Lenin accord-ingly put forward a plan for an all-Russia Iskra organisation, which was to pave the way for uniting Russia’s scattered Social-Democratic organisations into a single centralised Marxist party. 
 This plan he originally outlined in his article “Where To Begin?” (May 1901), and subsequently elaborated in detail in What Is To Be Done? (autumn 1901-February 1902). 
 In carrying out this plan Lenin and his associates had to com-bat parochial tendencies among some of the Iskra practical workers. 
 “We must say,” Lenin wrote in a letter to S. 
 O. 
 Zederbaum in July 1901 (present edition, Vol. 
 34), “that we in general regard any plan for the publication of any district or local organ by the Iskra organisation in Russia as absolutely incorrect and harmful. 
 The Iskra organisation exists in order to support and build up Iskra and to unite the Party thereby, not to cause a dispersion of forces, of which there is quite enough without it. 
” In January 1902 a conference of Iskra -ists was held in Samara, with G. 
 M. 
 and Z. 
 P. 
 Krzhizhanovsky, F. 
 V. 
 Lengnik, M. 
 A. 
 Sil-vin, V. 
 P. 
 Artsybushev, and D. 
 I. 
 and M. 
 I. 
 Ulyanov taking part. 
 This conference set up a Bureau of the Iskra organisation in Russia, established regular arrangements for contacts among members of the organisation and with the editorial board and for the collection and allocation of funds, and mapped out the line in relation to the committees and local publications. 
 It was further decided, with a view to the cardinal objective of securing the committees’ adher-ence to Iskra and recognition of it as the general Party organ, to 41 42 43 44send members out to various parts of the country. 
 “Your initiative,” Lenin wrote to the organisers of the conference, “has heartened us tremendously. 
 Hurrah! That’s the right way! Reach out wider! And operate more independently, with greater initiative you are the first to have begun in such a broad way, and that means the continuation, too, will be successful” ( Lenin Miscellany VIII , p. 
 221). 
 Although the arrest of a number of Iskra -ists in February 1902 put added difficulties in the way of carrying out the conference deci-sions, the Iskra organisation, with What Is To Be Done? to guide it, launched a vigorous drive to propagate and practically execute Lenin’s plan for building a real party. 
 It achieved far-reaching results in effecting actual unity of the Social-Democratic organisa-tions on the principles of revolutionary Marxism. 
 By the end of 1902 nearly all the leading committees had proclaimed their soli-darity with Iskra . 
 The Iskra -ists were the leading spirits in setting up, at the Pskov conference of November 2-3 (15-16), 1902, the Organising Committee for convening the Second Party Congress, and to this committee they handed over all their contacts. 
 The Iskra organi-sation, which remained in existence until the Second Party Con-gress played a vital part in preparing and arranging that Congress which brought into being a revolutionary Marxist party in Russia. 
 p. 
 74 The Statement Concerning Martov ’s Report was read by Lenin at the third sitting of the League Congress and handed in to the Con-gress Bureau. 
 No court of arbitration to examine Martov’s slan-derous accusations was ever held, as Martov was obliged to admit, in a letter of November 16 (29), 1903, that he had no doubts of Lenin’s sincerity and good faith. 
 p.

 18 for 1890-91) and Engels’s “Contri-bution to the Critique of the Draft Social-Democratic Programme”(in No. 
 1 for 1901-02). 
 While Engels was alive he constantly helped the editors with suggestions and advice, and not infrequently criticised them for departures from Marxism. 
 Contributors includ-ed August Bebel, Wilhelm Liebknecht, Rosa Luxemburg, Franz Mehring, Clara Zetkin, G. 
 V. 
 Plekhanov, Paul Lafargue, and other leading figures in the German and international working-class movement of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. 
 Beginning with the latter half of the nineties, the Neue Zeit made a practice of publishing the writings of the revisionists, notablyBernstein’s series “Problems of Socialism”, which inaugurated the revisionists’ campaign against Marxism. 
 During the First World War it adopted a Centrist, Kautskian position, in effect supportingthe social-chauvinists.

 p. 
 113 The Central Committee ’s ultimatum to the Mensheviks was present-ed on November 12 (25) 1903. 
 On October 22 (November 4) Lenin had sent the Central Committee a letter (present edition, Vol. 
 34) in which he proposed offering the Mensheviks the followingconditions: 1) co-optation of three of the ex-editors to the editorial board of the Central Organ; 2) re-establishment of the status quo in the League Abroad; 3) allowing the Mensheviks one seat on the Party Council. 
 These initial conditions did not meet with the support of the conciliationist members of the Central Committee. 
 In the same letter Lenin outlined and proposed simultaneously approving but not yet presenting to the Mensheviks the main points of anultimatum, that is, a statement of the practical concessions the Central Committee could permissibly make to them: 1) co-optation of the four ex-editors to the editorial board; 2) co-optation to theCentral Committee of two members of the opposition, to be chosen by the Central Committee itself; 3) re-establishment of the status quo in the League; 4) allowing the Mensheviks one seat on the PartyCouncil. 
 “If the ultimatum is rejected,” Lenin wrote, “then—war to a finish. 
 An extra condition: 5) cessation of all talk, gossip, and arguments about the dissensions at the Second Party Congress andafter. 
” These proposals of Lenin’s (except the extra condition) were included in the ultimatum of November 12 (25), but were toned down somewhat by the conciliationist members of the CentralCommittee. 
 The Mensheviks, whom Plekhanov helped greatly by co-opting all the ex-editors to the editorial board the day after the CentralCommittee’s ultimatum, rejected the ultimatum and took the way of open war against the majority of the Party.

 114 Economism was the opportunist trend in Russian Social-Democracy at the turn of the century, a Russian variety of international oppor-tunism; its organs were the newspaper Rabochaya Mysl (Worker ’s Thought ; 1897-1902), published in Russia, and the journal Rabo-cheye Dyelo (Workers ’ Cause , 1899-1902), published abroad. 
 The Economists restricted the tasks of the working-class move-ment to the economic struggle for higher wages, better working conditions, etc. 
, asserting that the political struggle was the busi-ness of the liberal bourgeoisie, and denied the leading role of the workers’ party, which, they considered, should merely observe the spontaneous development of the movement and follow in its wake. 
 In their glorifying of “spontaneity” they belittled the impor-tance of revolutionary theory and consciousness, declaring that the socialist ideology could grow out of the spontaneous movement; and by thus denying the need to imbue the workers’ movement with socialist consciousness, they cleared the way for bourgeois ideology. 
 They championed the scattered, isolated circles, with their parochial amateurish approach, fostering disunity, confusion, and wavering in the Social-Democratic ranks and opposing the creation of a centralised working-class party. 
 Economism threat-ened to divert the working class from the revolutionary, class path and reduce it to a political appendage of the bourgeoisie. 
 The Economists’ programme was set forth in the Credo , a mani-festo drawn up in 1899 by Y. 
 D. 
 Kuskova. 
 When this Credo reached Lenin, then in exile in Siberia, he replied with A Protest by Russian Social-Democrats —a trenchant criticism of the Economist ideas. 
 This protest was discussed and unanimously adopted by a meeting of 17 Marxists serving terms of political exile, held in the village of Yermakovskoye, Minusinsk Region. 
 A major part in the fight against Economism was played by Lenin’s Iskra ; and by his book What Is To Be Done? , published in March 1902, Lenin completed its ideological defeat.

 After the Menshevik edi-tors refused pusillanimously to print the “Letter” in Iskra , the Bolsheviks published it in leaflet form. 
 It had a wide circulation in Russia, where it was illegally reprinted.

 Originally founded in 1876 in Leipzig, it was banned under the Anti-Socialist Law, but in January 1891 resumed publication in Berlin as successor to the Berliner Volks-blatt (Berlin People ’s Gazette , founded in 1884), under the editor-ship of Wilhelm Liebknecht. 
 Engels fought in the columns of the Vorwärts against every manifestation of opportunism; but in the late nineties, after Engels’s death, the paper fell into the hands of the Right wing of the party and from then on regularly printed the writings of the opportunists who dominated in the German Social-Democratic movement and the Second International.

, supporting the Economists and later, after the split in the Party, the Mensheviks. 
 In the years of reaction that followed the defeat of the Russian Revolution of 1905-07 it published slanderous articles by Trotsky while denying Lenin and the Bolsheviks the opportunity to controvert him and give an objective account of the state of affairs in the Party. 
 During the First World War the Vorwärts took a social-chau-vinist stand. 
 After the Great October Socialist Revolution in Rus-sia it became one of the fountain-heads of anti-Soviet propaganda. 
 It ceased publication in 1933.

 139 The Party Council session held in Geneva on January 15-17 (28-30), 1904, was “called on the initiative of the representatives of the Central Organ to discuss measures for harmonising the activities of the Central Committee and Central Organ in the publication of Party literature” ( Lenin Miscellany X , p. 
 181). 
 It was attended by Lenin, Lengnik, Plekhanov, Axelrod, and Martov. 
 69 70 71 72On Lenin’s proposal, the Council resolved to include in the agenda and discuss as the first item the question of measures to restore peace in the Party. 
 On January 15 (28) Lenin, on behalf of the Central Committee, moved a resolution on this question sheviks would not agree to this resolution, Lenin and Lengnik pro-posed, on January 16 (29), another resolution on restoring peace in the Party, which the Council adopted by three votes (Lenin, Lengnik, and Plekhanov) to two (Martov and Axelrod). 
 However, instead of then practically discussing what must be done to re-store peace, the Council, over Lenin’s protest, proceeded to vote Plekhanov’s resolution, which demanded co-optation of Mensheviks to the Central Committee. 
 By the votes of Plekhanov, Martov, and Axelrod, this resolution was passed. 
 Thereupon the Central Com-mittee representatives (Lenin and Lengnik) recorded on January 17 (30) a dissenting opinion which censured Plekhanov’s resolution as ignoring the will of the majority of the Second Party Congress. 
 The text of the dissenting opinion (pp. 
 148-51 of this volume) was drawn up by Lenin. 
 After the Mensheviks frustrated every effort to establish peace in the Party, Lenin moved a resolution on convening the Third Party Congress, as the only way out of the situation (p. 
 152 of this volume). 
 By the votes of Plekhanov, Martov, and Axelrod this resolution was rejected and Martov’s resolution against a congress was passed. 
 Concerning the publication of Party literature no agreement was reached either. 
 Rejecting the resolutions moved on this subject by Lenin (p. 
 155 of this volume), the Council adopted resolutions which endorsed the factional, disruptive activities of the Menshevik editorial board of Iskra . 
 The Council session of January 1904 made it plain that with Plekhanov’s defection to the Mensheviks the Council had become an instrument of the Mensheviks’ fight against the Party.

 The book evoked fury among the Mensheviks. 
 Plekhanov de-manded that the Central Committee disavow it. 
 The conciliators on the Central Committee tried to prevent its publication andcirculation. 
 Though published abroad, One Step Forward , Two Steps Back had a wide circulation among advanced workers in Russia. 
 Copiesof the book were found during arrests and house-searches in Mos-cow St. 
 Petersburg, Riga, Saratov, Tula, Orel, Ufa, Perm, Ko-stroma Shchigri, Shavli (Kovno Gubernia), and elsewhere. 
 Leninincluded the book in the Twelve Years collection published in 1907 (the date on the title-page is 1908), omitting sections J, K, L, M, O, and P making abridgements in other sections, and adding a fewexplanatory notes.

 committees held on March 23-28 (April 5-10), 1902, in Belostok.

 215 Rabochaya Mysl (Worker ’s Thought ) was an Economist group which published a paper under this name. 
 The paper, edited by K. 
 M. 
 Takhtarev and others, appeared from October 1897 to December 1902; 16 issues were published altogether. 
 Rabochaya Mysl advocated frankly opportunist views. 
 It op-posed the political struggle and restricted the tasks of the working-class movement to “the interests of the moment”, to pressing forindividual partial reforms, chiefly of an economic nature. 
 Glori-fying “spontaneity” in the movement, it opposed the creation of an independent proletarian party and belittled the importanceof revolutionary theory and consciousness, maintaining that the socialist ideology could grow out of the spontaneous movement. 
 The views expounded by Rabochaya Mysl , as the Russian variety of international opportunism, were criticised by Lenin in the article “A Retrograde Trend in Russian Social-Democracy” (pres-ent edition, Vol. 
 4, pp. 
 255-85), in his Iskra articles, and in What Is To Be Done? p.

 236 Zemlya i Volya (Land and Freedom ) was a revolutionary Narod-nik organisation formed in St. 
 Petersburg in the autumn of 1876; originally known as the Northern Revolutionary Narodnik Group,it took the name Zemlya i Volya in 1878. 
 Among the members were Mark and Olga Natanson, G. 
 V. 
 Plekhanov, O.

 Aptekman, A. 
 D. 
 and A.

 Mikhailov, A.

 M. 
 Kravchinsky, D. 
 A. 
 Klements, A. 
 D. 
 Oboleshev, Sophia Perovskaya and other prominent revolutionaries of the seventies. 
 While not renouncing socialism as the ultimate goal, Zemlya iVolya put forward as the immediate aim the satisfaction of “the people’s demands and desires as they are at the moment”, namely, the demand for “land and freedom”. 
 “Needless to say”, its programme 97declared, “this formula can be made a reality only through violent revolution ”, with a view to which it advocated exciting “popular discontent” and “disorganising the power of the state”. 
 For the purpose of agitation among the peasantry, members of the organi-sation set up rural “colonies”, chiefly in the agricultural gubernias along the Volga and in the fertile central regions. 
 They also carried on agitation among the workers and the student youth. 
 On Decem-ber 6 (18), 1876, they organised a demonstration in the Kazan Square in St. 
 Petersburg. 
 In the course of 1878-79 Zemlya i Volya published five i ssues of a journal of the same name. 
 Although connected with some of the workers’ circles, Zemlya i Volya could not and did not want to be the leader of the working-class movement, since in common with other Narodniks it deniedthe vanguard role of the working class. 
 Nor did it understand the importance of political struggle, which in its view only diverted the revolutionaries’ energies and might weaken their ties withthe people. 
 Unlike the Narodnik groups of the early seventies, Zemlya i Volya built up a close-knit organisation, based on principles ofstrict centralisation and discipline. 
 There was a central “core” and around it there were territorial and specialised groups (for work among the peasantry and among the workers, for “disorganis-ing” activities, and so on); the “core” was headed by an “admini-stration” (or “commission”) which controlled the activities of the groups and supplied them with literature, funds, etc. 
 The Zemlyai Volya Rules, adopted in the winter of 1876-77, stipulated subor-dination of minority to majority, bound every member to dedicate and sacrifice to the organisation’s interests “all his energies, means,connections, sympathies and antipathies, and even life itself”, and imposed absolute secrecy in regard to all the organisation’s internal affairs. 
 By 1879, with their socialist agitation among the peasants hav-ing little effect and with government persecution increasing, the majority of the members began to lean towards political terror-ism as the principal means of achieving their programme. 
 There were sharp disagreements about this, and at its Voronezh Congress in June 1879 Zemlya i Volya split in two: the adherents of theold tactics (headed by Plekhanov) formed an organisation called Chorny Peredel (General Redistribution), while the advocates of terrorism (A. 
 I. 
 Zhelyabov and others) founded Narodnaya Volya(People’s Will). 
 p. 
 256 Narodnaya Volya (People ’s Will )—the secret political organisation of the terrorist Narodniks, formed in August 1879 following the split in Zemlya i Volya. 
 It was headed by an Executive Committee consisting of A. 
 I. 
 Zhelyabov, A. 
 D. 
 Mikhailov, M. 
 F. 
 Frolenko,N. 
 A. 
 Morozov, Vera Figner, Sophia Perovskaya, A. 
 A. 
 Kvyat-kovsky, and others. 
 While still adhering to the Narodnik utopian-socialist ideas, Narodnaya Volya believed in political struggle also, regarding the 98 99 100as a major aim. 
 Its programme envisaged a “permanent popular representative body” elected by universal suffrage, the proclama-tion of democratic liberties, the transfer of the land to the people, and measures to put the factories in the hands of the workers. 
 “TheNarodnaya Volya members,” Lenin wrote, “made a step forward when they took up the political struggle, but they failed to connect it with socialism” (see present edition, Vol. 
 8, “Working-ClassDemocracy and Bourgeois Democracy”). 
 Narodnaya Volya fought heroically against the tsarist auto-cracy. 
 But, going by the erroneous theory of “active” heroes anda “passive” mass, it expected to achieve the remaking of society without the participation of the people, by its own efforts, through individual terrorism that would intimidate and disorganise thegovernment. 
 After the assassination of Alexander II on March 1, 1881, the government was able, by savage reprisals, death sen-tence and acts of provocation, to crush it out of existence. 
 Repeated attempts to revive the organisation during the eighties ended in failure. 
 Thus, in 1886 a group in the Narodnaya Volya tradition was formed by A. 
 I. 
 Ulyanov (elder brother ofLenin) and P. 
 Y. 
 Shevyryov; but after an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Alexander III in 1887, the group was uncovered and its active members executed. 
 While criticising Narodnaya Volya’s erroneous, utopian pro-gramme, Lenin expressed great respect for its members’ selfless struggle against tsarism. 
 In A Protest by Russian Social-Democrats (1899) he pointed out that “the members of the old Narodnaya Volya managed to play an enormous role in the history of Russia, despite the fact that only narrow social strata supported the fewheroes, and despite the fact that it was by no means a revolution-ary theory which served as the banner of the movement” (see present edition, Vol. 
 4, p. 
 181).

 258 The reference is to an incident which took place in Hamburg in 1900 in connection with the conduct of a group of members of the Free Bricklayers’ Union who performed piece work during astrike in violation of the instructions of the trade union centre. 
 The Hamburg Bricklayers’ Union complained to the local Social-Democratic Party organisation about the strike-breaking activi-ties of the Social-Democrat members of the group. 
 A court of arbi-tration appointed by the Central Executive of the Social-Demo-cratic Party condemned the conduct of these Social-Democratsbut turned down the proposal that they be expelled from the Party.

 327 Lenin is referring to a speech made by the Economist Akimov during the Congress discussion of the Party programme. 
 One of Akimov’s objections against the Iskra draft programme was that it did not mention the word “proletariat” in the nominative case, as subject of the sentence, but only in the genitive (“party of the proletariat”). 
 This, Akimov claimed, showed a tendency to exalt the party above the proletariat. 
 p. 
 331 Lenin is alluding to the following passage in Marx’s Introduction to his “Critique of the Hegelian Philosophy of Law”: “The weapon of criticism cannot, of course, take the place of criticism with weapons; it is by material force that material force must be overthrown. 
” p. 
 332 Mountain and Gironde —the two political groups of the bourgeoisie during the French bourgeois revolution at the close of the eigh-teenth century. 
 Montagnards, or Jacobins, was the name given to the more resolute representatives of the bourgeoisie, the revolu-tionary class of the time; they stood for the abolition of absolutism and the feudal system. 
 The Girondists, in distinction to them vacillated between revolution and counter-revolution, and their policy was one of compromise with the monarchy. 
 Lenin applied the term “Socialist Gironde” to the opportunist trend in the Social-Democratic movement, and the term “Moun-tain” or proletarian Jacobins, to the revolutionary Social-Demo-crats.

 p. 
 377 The reference is to the views of P. 
 B. 
 Struve, leading representa-tive of “legal Marxism”, and his book Critical Remarks on the Subject of Russia ’s Economic Development (1894). 
 Already in this early work Struve’s bourgeois-apologetic thinking was clearly discernible. 
 The views of Struve and the other “legal Marxists” were assailed by Lenin in a paper read to a St. 
 Petersburg Marxist circle in the autumn of 1894, entitled “The Reflection of Marxism in Bourgeois Literature”. 
 This paper Lenin then worked up, at the close of 1894 and the beginning of 1895, into his essay “The Econom-ic Content of Narodism and the Criticism of It in Mr. 
 Struve’s Book” (present edition, Vol. 
 1, pp. 
 333-507).

 p. 
 430 The Party Council session of May 31 and June 5 (June 13 and 18), 1904, was held in Geneva, with Lenin, Plekhanov, Noskov, Axel-rod, and Martov attending. 
 The first sitting discussed the conven-ing of an inter-party conference of all revolutionary and opposi-tion parties in Russia, and the forthcoming Amsterdam Interna-tional Congress. 
 The second dealt with internal Party affairs: 1) the right of the central Party institutions (the Central Organ and Central Committee) to recall their representatives from the Coun-cil, 2) the number of votes required under the Rules for effecting co-optation to the local committees; 3) co-optation to the commit-tees and the right of the Central Committee to appoint new mem-bers to them; 4) the voting qualifications of Party organisations on the question of convening the Third Party Congress, and cer-tain other items. 
 On the more important questions of internal Party life, Men-shevik decisions were passed.

S. 
P. 
). 
 While in general accepting the Social-Democratic programme, it believed in individual terrorism and the federal principle of organisation. 
 The party stood for closer contact between the Polish and Russian revolutionary movement; its immediate aim was a democratic constitution for Russia with autonomy for Poland. 
 The Proletariat Party did not play any noticeable part in the Polish revolutionary movement, and went out of existence after the Revolution of 1905-07.

 460 Lenin is speaking of the “July Declaration”—a resolution adopted in the name of the Central Committee in July 1904 by the conci-liator members Krasin, Noskov (Glebov), and Galperin it was published in Iskra , No. 
 72 (August 25, 1904) under the title “State-ment by the Central Committee”. 
 In this resolution the concilia-tors recognised as legitimate the Plekhanov-co-opted Menshevik editorial board of Iskra and defended the opportunism of the Men-sheviks; they co-opted to the Central Committee three other con-ciliators—Lyubimov, Karpov, and Dubrovinsky; they came out against convening the Third Party Congress and dissolved the 140 141 142 143 144 145 146Central Committee’s Southern Bureau, which had been agitating for a congress. 
 They deprived Lenin of the powers of foreign repre-sentative of the Central Committee and forbade his writings to be published without their sanction. 
 The adoption of the “July Declaration” meant total betrayal of the Second Party Congress decisions and the open defection of the conciliators on the Central Committee to the side of the Men-sheviks.

 489 The Zemstvo Campaign and “Iskra ’s” Plan is a criticism of a letter to the Party organisations issued by the editors of the Menshevik Iskra in November 1904. 
 It evoked a reply from the editors, in the form of a second letter; both letters bore the superscription “For Party Members Only”. 
 The second letter was, however, cir-culated exclusively among Mensheviks, and this caused Lenin to add a postscript to his pamphlet (last two paragraphs on p. 
 516). 
 As the pamphlet had already been printed and circulated to the committees, the postscript was printed separately and pasted into the copies still on hand.
