 Early January 1918 ...245 405 421 PREFACE Volume 26 contains the works V. 
 I. 
 Lenin wrote between September 1917 and February 1918. 
 A large part of them deals with the Bolshevik Party’s preparation of the armed uprising in October 1917. 
 They include “The BolsheviksMust Assume Power”, “Marxism and Insurrection”, “TheCrisis Has Matured”, “Can the Bolsheviks Retain StatePower?”, “Advice of an Onlooker”, directives to the CentralCommittee and the Petrograd and Moscow Party Commit-tees, which Lenin wrote while in hiding. 
 In them he elabo-rates on Marx’s ideas of insurrection as an art and sets outa concrete plan for the uprising. 
 A considerable part of the volume consists of reports and speeches at congresses of Soviets, meetings of Partyand local government workers, appeals and messages to the people, which show Lenin as the leader of the Party and the working masses, the organiser and head of theSoviet state in its first months. 
 The volume also contains the drafts of the first decrees and the decrees issued by the Soviet Government whichwere written by Lenin and signed by him in his capacity of Chairman of the Council of People’s Commissars, namely, the Decree on Peace, the Decree on Land, the Draft Regu-lations on Workers’ Control, the Draft Decree on the Rightof Recall, the Draft Decree on the Nationalisation of theBanks and on Measures Necessary for Its Implementation,Draft Decree on the Dissolution of the Constituent Assem-bly, etc. 
 Lenin’s struggle against the provocative and treacherous policy of the Trotskyites and “Left-wing Communists” over the conclusion of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk is reflected in his “Outline Programme for Peace Negotiations”, “On the History of the Question of the Unfortunate Peace”, and speeches at meetings of the C. 
C. 
, R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
(B. 
) inJanuary and February 1918, and other documents. 
 Several of the works deal with the convocation and disso-lution of the Constituent Assembly. 
 They are Theses on theConstituent Assembly, Declaration of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 (Bolsheviks) Group at the Constituent Assembly Meeting, January 5 (18), 1918, “People from Another World”, etc. 
 The volume also includes “Fear of the Collapse of the Old and the Fight for the New”, “How to Organise Compe-tition?”, “Draft Decree on Consumers’ Communes”, whichgive an analysis of various aspects of socialist construction and substantiate the need for a full-scale socialist compe-tition campaign. 
 These works lay accent on the strictestaccounting and control in the economy, as the main task. 
 Fourteen items in this volume are included in the Collected Works for the first time. 
 They are: “Draft Resolution on Freedom of the Press”, “Statement to the Bolshevik Group at the Extraordinary All-Russia Congress of Soviets of Peasants’ Deputies”, “The Tasks of the Public Library inPetrograd”, “Outline Programme for Peace Negotiations”, “On the Opening of the Constituent Assembly”, “DraftResolution on the Provisional Bureau of the BolshevikGroup in the Constituent Assembly”, “Direct-Line Con-versation with L. 
 D. 
 Trotsky, Chairman of the Soviet Peace Delegation at Brest-Litovsk”, “Instructions to theRed Guard H. 
 Q. 
”, “Draft Decree on the Nationalisation ofMerchant Marine and Inland Water Transport”, “WirelessMessage Addressed to All. 
 Special to the Peace Delegationin Brest-Litovsk”, “Wireless Message Addressed to All”, “Trotsky. 
 Russian Peace Delegation. 
 Brest-Litovsk”, “Di-rect-Line Conversation with the Moscow Soviet”. 
 All thesewere written after the October Revolution and are a reflec-tion of the Bolshevik Party’s efforts to consolidate Sovietpower and secure a just and democratic peace. 
 THE BOLSHEVIKS MUST ASSUME POWER1 A LETTER TO THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE AND THE PETROGRAD AND MOSCOW COMMITTEES OF THE R.

P. 
 (B. 
) The Bolsheviks, having obtained a majority in the So-viets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies of both capitals, can and must take state power into their own hands. 
 They can because the active majority of revolutionary elements in the two chief cities is large enough to carry thepeople with it, to overcome the opponent’s resistance, tosmash him, and to gain and retain power. 
 For the Bol-sheviks, by immediately proposing a democratic peace, by immediately giving the land to the peasants and by re-establishing the democratic institutions and liberties whichhave been mangled and shattered by Kerensky, will forma government which nobody will be able to overthrow. 
 The majority of the people are on our side . 
 This was proved by the long and painful course of events from May 6 to August 31 and to September 12. 
 2 The majority gained in the Soviets of the metropolitan cities resulted from the people coming over to our side . 
 The wavering of the Social-ist-Revolutionaries3 and Mensheviks and the increase in the number of internationalists within their ranks provethe same thing. 
 The Democratic Conference 4 represents not a majority of the revolutionary people, but only the compromising upper strata of the petty bourgeoisie . 
 We must not be de-ceived by the election figures; elections prove nothing. 
 Com-pare the elections to the city councils of Petrograd andMoscow with the elections to the Soviets. 
 Compare the elections in Moscow with the Moscow strike of August 12. 
 Those are objective facts regarding that majority of revo-lutionary elements that are leading the people. 
 The Democratic Conference is deceiving the peasants; it is giving them neither peace nor land. 
 A Bolshevik government alone will satisfy the demands of the peasants. 
 * * * Why must the Bolsheviks assume power at this very mo-ment ? Because the impending surrender of Petrograd will make our chances a hundred times less favourable. 
 And it is not in our power to prevent the surrender of Petrograd while the army is headed by Kerensky and Co. 
 Nor can we “wait” for the Constituent Assembly, for by surrendering Petrograd Kerensky and Co. 
 can always frustrate its convocation. 
 Our Party alone, on taking pow-er, can secure the Constituent Assembly’s convocation;it will then accuse the other parties of procrastination andwill be able to substantiate its accusations. 
 5 A separate peace between the British and German im-perialists must and can be prevented, but only by quick action. 
 The people are tired of the waverings of the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
 It is only our victory in themetropolitan cities that will carry the peasants with us. 
 * * * We are concerned now not with the “day”, or “moment” of insurrection in the narrow sense of the word. 
 That willbe only decided by the common voice of those who are incontact with the workers and soldiers, with the masses. 
 The point is that now, at the Democratic Conference, our Party has virtually its own congress, and this congress (whether it wishes to or not) must decide the fate of therevolution. 
 The point is to make the task clear to the Party. 
 The present task must be an armed uprising in Petrograd andMoscow (with its region), the seizing of power and the overthrow of the government . 
 We must consider how to agitate for this without expressly saying as much in thepress. 
 We must remember and weigh Marx’s words about insur-rection, “ Insurrection is an art ”,6 etc. 
 * * * It would be naïve to wait for a “formal” majority for the Bolsheviks. 
 No revolution ever waits for that . 
 Kerensky and Co. 
 are not waiting either, and are preparing to surren-der Petrograd. 
 It is the wretched waverings of the Demo-cratic Conference that are bound to exhaust the patienceof the workers of Petrograd and Moscow! History will notforgive us if we do not assume power now. 
 There is no apparatus? There is an apparatus—the So-viets and the democratic organisations. 
 The international situation right now, on the eve of the conclusion of a sepa-rate peace between the British and the Germans, is in our favour . 
 To propose peace to the nations right now means to win . 
 By taking power both in Moscow and in Petrograd at once (it doesn’t matter which comes first, Moscow may possibly begin), we shall win absolutely and unquestionably .

) One of the most vicious and probably most widespread distortions of Marxism resorted to by the dominant “so-cialist” parties is the opportunist lie that preparation for insurrection, and generally the treatment of insurrectionas an art, is “Blanquism”. 
 7 Bernstein, the leader of opportunism, has already earned himself unfortunate fame by accusing Marxism of Blan-quism, and when our present-day opportunists cry Blanqu-ism they do not improve on or “enrich” the meagre “ideas” of Bernstein one little bit. 
 Marxists are accused of Blanquism for treating insur-rection as an art! Can there be a more flagrant perversionof the truth, when not a single Marxist will deny that itwas Marx who expressed himself on this score in the most definite, precise and categorical manner, referring to in-surrection specifically as an art, saying that it must be treated as an art, that you must win the first success and then proceed from success to success, never ceasing theoffensive against the enemy, taking advantage of his con-fusion, etc. 
, etc. 
? To be successful, insurrection must rely not upon conspir-acy and not upon a party, but upon the advanced class. 
That is the first point. 
 Insurrection must rely upon a revo-lutionary upsurge of the people . 
 That is the second point. 
 Insurrection must rely upon that turning-point in the history of the growing revolution when the activity of the advanced ranks of the people is at its height, and when the vacillations in the ranks of the enemy and in the ranks of the weak , half-hearted and irresolute friends of the revolution are strongest. 
 That is the third point. 
 And these three conditions for raising the question of insurrection distin-guish Marxism from Blanquism . 
 Once these conditions exist, however, to refuse to treat insurrection as an art is a betrayal of Marxism and a bet-rayal of the revolution. 
 To show that it is precisely the present moment that the Party must recognise as the one in which the entire course of events has objectively placed insurrection on the order of the day and that insurrection must be treated as an art, itwill perhaps be best to use the method of comparison, andto draw a parallel between July 3-4 8 and the September days. 
 On July 3-4 it could have been argued, without violating the truth, that the correct thing to do was to take power, for our enemies would in any case have accused us of insur-rection and ruthlessly treated us as rebels. 
 However, tohave decided on this account in favour of taking power atthat time would have been wrong, because the objectiveconditions for the victory of the insurrection did not exist. 
 (1) We still lacked the support of the class which is the vanguard of the revolution. 
 We still did not have a majority among the workers andsoldiers of Petrograd and Moscow. 
 Now we have a majorityin both Soviets. 
 It was created solely by the history of July and August, by the experience of the “ruthless treat-ment” meted out to the Bolsheviks, and by the experience of the Kornilov revolt. 
 9 (2) There was no country-wide revolutionary upsurge at that time. 
 There is now, after the Kornilov revolt; thesituation in the provinces and assumption of power by theSoviets in many localities prove this. 
 (3) At that time there was no vacillation on any serious political scale among our enemies and among the irresolute petty bourgeoisie. 
 Now the vacillation is enormous. 
 Ourmain enemy, Allied and world imperialism (for worldimperialism is headed by the “Allies”), has begun to waver between a war to a victorious finish and a separate peacedirected against Russia. 
 Our petty-bourgeois democrats, having clearly lost their majority among the people, have begun to vacillate enormously, and have rejected a bloc,i. 
e. 
, a coalition, with the Cadets. 
 10 (4) Therefore, an insurrection on July 3-4 would have been a mistake; we could not have retained power either physically or politically. 
 We could not have retained it physically even though Petrograd was at times in ourhands, because at that time our workers and soldiers wouldnot have fought and died for Petrograd. 
 There was not at the time that “savageness”, or fierce hatred both of the Kerenskys and of the Tseretelis and Chernovs. 
 Our people had still not been tempered by the experience of the perse-cution of the Bolsheviks in which the Socialist-Revolution-aries and Mensheviks participated. 
 We could not have retained power politically on July 3-4 because, before the Kornilov revolt , the army and the provinces could and would have marched against Petrograd. 
 Now the picture is entirely different. 
 We have the following of the majority of a class , the vanguard of the revolution, the vanguard of the people,which is capable of carrying the masses with it. 
 We have the following of the majority of the people, because Chernov’s resignation, while by no means the only symptom, is the most striking and obvious symptom that the peasants will not receive land from the Socialist-Revolution-aries’ bloc (or from the Socialist-Revolutionaries them-selves). 
 And that is the chief reason for the popular characterof the revolution. 
 We are in the advantageous position of a party that knows for certain which way to go at a lime when imperialism as a whole and the Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary bloc as a whole are vacillating in an incredible fashion. 
 Our victory is assured , for the people are close to despera-tion, and we are showing the entire people a sure way out;we demonstrated to the entire people during the “Kornilov days” the value of our leadership, and then proposed to the politicians of the bloc a compromise, which they rejected , although there is no let-up in their vacillations. 
 It would be a great mistake to think that our offer of a compromise had not yet been rejected, and that the Dem-ocratic Conference may still accept it. 
 The compromise was proposed by a party to parties ; it could not have been proposed in any other way. 
 It was rejected by parties . 
 The Democratic Conference is a conference , and nothing more. 
 One thing must not be forgotten, namely, that the majority of the revolutionary people, the poor, embittered peasants, are not represented in it. 
 It is a conference of a minority of the people —this obvious truth must not be forgotten. 
 It would be a big mistake, sheer parliamentary cretinismon our part, if we were to regard the Democratic Conferenceas a parliament; for even if it were to proclaim itself a per-manent and sovereign parliament of the revolution, it would nevertheless decide nothing . 
 The power of decision lies outside it in the working-class quarters of Petrograd and Moscow. 
 All the objective conditions exist for a successful insur-rection. 
 We have the exceptional advantage of a situationin which only our victory in the insurrection can put an end to that most painful thing on earth, vacillation, which has worn the people out; in which only our victory in the insurrection will give the peasants land immediately;a situation in which only our victory in the insurrection can foil the game of a separate peace directed against the rev-olution—foil it by publicly proposing a fuller, juster andearlier peace, a peace that will benefit the revolution. 
 Finally, our Party alone can, by a victorious insurrection, save Petrograd; for if our proposal for peace is rejected, ifwe do not secure even an armistice, then we shall become “defencists”, we shall place ourselves at the head of the war parties , we shall be the war party par excellence , and we shall conduct the war in a truly revolutionary manner. 
 We shall take away all the bread and boots from the capitalists. 
 We shall leave them only crusts and dress them in bast shoes. 
We shall send all the bread and footwear to the front. 
 And then we shall save Petrograd. 
The resources, both material and spiritual, for a truly revolutionary war in Russia are still immense; the chances are a hundred to one that the Germans will grant us at least an armistice. 
 And to secure an armistice now would initself mean to win the whole world . 
 * * * Having recognised the absolute necessity for an insur-rection of the workers of Petrograd and Moscow in order tosave the revolution and to save Russia from a “separate” partition by the imperialists of both groups, we must first adapt our political tactics at the Conference to the condi-tions of the growing insurrection; secondly, we must show that it is not only in words that we accept Marx’s idea thatinsurrection must be treated as an art. 
 At the Conference we must immediately cement the Bolshevik group, without striving after numbers, andwithout fearing to leave the waverers in the waverers’ camp. 
 They are more useful to the cause of the revolution there than in the camp of the resolute and devoted fighters. 
 We must draw up a brief declaration from the Bolshe-viks, emphasising in no uncertain manner the irrelevanceof long speeches and of “speeches” in general, the necessityfor immediate action to save the revolution, the absolute necessity for a complete break with the bourgeoisie, for the removal of the present government, in its entirety, fora complete rupture with the Anglo-French imperialists, whoare preparing a “separate” partition of Russia, and for theimmediate transfer of all power to revolutionary democrats , headed by the revolutionary proletariat . 
 Our declaration must give the briefest and most tren-chant formulation of this conclusion in connection with the programme proposals of peace for the peoples, land for thepeasants, confiscation of scandalous profits, and a checkon the scandalous sabotage of production by the capi-talists. 
 The briefer and more trenchant the declaration, the better. 
 Only two other highly important points must beclearly indicated in it, namely, that the people are wornout by the vacillations, that they are fed up with the irres-olution of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks;and that we are definitely breaking with these parties because they have betrayed the revolution. 
 And another thing. 
 By immediately proposing a peace without annexations, by immediately breaking with theAllied imperialists and with all imperialists, either weshall at once obtain an armistice, or the entire revolutionaryproletariat will rally to the defence of the country, and a really just, really revolutionary war will then be waged by revolutionary democrats under the leadership of the proletar-iat. 
 Having read this declaration, and having appealed for decisions and not talk, for action and not resolution-writing, we must dispatch our entire group to the factories and the barracks . 
 Their place is there, the pulse of life is there, there is the source of salvation for our revolution, and there isthe motive force of the Democratic Conference. 
 There, in ardent and impassioned speeches, we must ex-plain our programme and put the alternative: either the Con-ference adopts it in its entirety , or else insurrection. 
 There is no middle course. 
 Delay is impossible. 
 The revolution isdying. 
 By putting the question in this way, by concentrating our entire group in the factories and barracks, we shall be able to determine the right moment to start the insurrection. 
 In order to treat insurrection in a Marxist way, i. 
e. 
, as an art, we must at the same time, without losing a singlemoment, organise a headquarters of the insurgent detach-ments, distribute our forces, move the reliable regimentsto the most important points, surround the AlexandrinskyTheatre, occupy the Peter and Paul Fortress, 11 arrest the General Staff and the government, and move against the officer cadets and the Savage Division12 those detachments which would rather die than allow the enemy to approachthe strategic points of the city. 
 We must mobilise the armedworkers and call them to fight the last desperate fight,occupy the telegraph and the telephone exchange at once, move our insurrection headquarters to the central telephone exchange and connect it by telephone with all the factories,all the regiments, all the points of armed fighting, etc. 
 Of course, this is all by way of example, only to illustrate the fact that at the present moment it is impossible toremain loyal to Marxism, to remain loyal to the revolution unless insurrection is treated as an art .

 2 with a typewritten copy THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION AND CIVIL WAR THEY ARE TRYING TO FRIGHTEN US WITH CIVIL WAR The bourgeoisie, frightened by the refusal of the Menshe-viks and Socialist-Revolutionaries to join a bloc with the Cadets, and by the probability of the democrats being quite capable of forming a government without them and govern-ing Russia against them, are doing their best to intimidatethe democrats. 
 Scare them as much as you can! This is the slogan of the whole bourgeois press. 
 Scare them with all your might! Lie, slander, but frighten them! Birzhevka 13 does its scaring by fabricating news about Bolshevik activities. 
 Others by spreading rumours aboutAlexeyev’s resignation, and about the imminent Germanoffensive against Petrograd, as if the facts do not provethat it is the Kornilov generals (to whom Alexeyev un-doubtedly belongs) who are capable of opening the front to the Germans in Galicia and near Riga and near Petrograd, andthat it is the Kornilov generals who are arousing the great-est hatred in the army against the General Staff. 
 To make this method of intimidating the democrats more “solid” and convincing, they refer to the danger of “civil war”. 
 Of all the methods of intimidation, that of scaring with civil war is perhaps the most widespread. 
 Hereis the way the Rostov-on-the-Don Committee of the people’sfreedom party formulated this widespread idea, heartily wel-comed in philistine circles, in its resolution of September 1(Rech 14 No. 
 210): “The Committee is convinced that civil war may sweep away all the gains of the revolution and drown in rivers of blood our young, still unstable freedom, and is of the opinion that it is necessary to make an energetic protest against developing the revolution as pro-posed by the unrealisable socialist utopias if we are to save the gainsof the revolution. 
” Here, the fundamental idea which is to be met with innu-merable times in Rech editorials, in the articles of Plekha-nov and Potresov, in the editorials of Menshevik papers, etc. 
,etc. 
, is expressed in the clearest, most precise, well consid-ered and substantial form. 
 It will therefore be useful to take up this idea in greater detail. 
 Let us try to make a more concrete analysis of the civil war question, on the basis of the half year’s experience ofour revolution, among other things. 
 This experience, similarly to the experience of all Euro-pean revolutions, from the end of the eighteenth century on, shows that civil war is the sharpest form of the class struggle, it is that point in the class struggle when clashesand battles, economic and political, repeating themselves,growing, broadening, becoming acute, turn into an armedstruggle of one class against another. 
 More often than not—one may say almost always—in all more or less free and advanced countries the civil war is between those classes whose antagonistic position towards each other is createdand deepened by the entire economic development of capi-talism, by the entire history of modern society the worldover—civil war is between the bourgeoisie and the pro-letariat. 
 During the past half year of our revolution, we have experienced very strong spontaneous outbursts (April 20-21, 15 July 3-4) in which the proletariat came very close to startinga civil war. 
 On the other hand, the Kornilov revolt was amilitary conspiracy supported by the landowners and capi-talists led by the Cadet Party, a conspiracy by which the bourgeoisie has actually begun a civil war. 
 Such are the facts. 
 Such is the history of our own revo-lution. 
 More than anything we must learn from this his-tory, we must give a great deal of thought to the course ithas taken and to its class significance. 
 Let us try to compare the germs of the proletarian civil war and the bourgeois civil war in Russia from the stand-point of (1) the spontaneous nature of the movement; (2) itsaims; (3) the political consciousness of the masses participat-ing in it; (4) the forces in the movement; (5) its tenacity. 
 We think that if all the parties which are now “unnecessarily throwing about” the words “civil war” were to approach the question in this way, and make a real attempt to study the germs of the civil war, the class consciousness of the entire Russian revolution would gain a very great deal. 
 Let us begin with the spontaneous nature of the movement. 
 For the July 3-4 movement we have the testimony of such witnesses as the Menshevik Rabochaya Gazet a16 and the Socialist-Revolutionary Dyelo Narod a17 which have recog-nised the spontaneous origin of the movement. 
 This testi-mony I quoted in an article published in Proletarskoye Dyelo ,18 and issued as a separate leaflet entitled An Answer . 
* For obvious reasons, however, the Mensheviks and the So-cialist-Revolutionaries, who are defending themselves and the part they played in persecuting the Bolsheviks, officiallycontinue to deny the spontaneous nature of the outburst ofJuly 3-4. 
 Let us put the controversial matter aside for the present. 
 Let us take what is undisputed. 
 No one denies the spon-taneous nature of the April 20-21 movement. 
 The Bolshe-vik Party joined this spontaneous movement under theslogan “All Power to the Soviets”; independently of theBolsheviks it was joined by the late Linde, who led 30,000armed soldiers into the street ready to arrest the government. 
(The action of these troops, let us say in parenthesis, has not been investigated and studied. 
 If it is examined close-ly, and April 20 is given its place in the historic sequenceof events, i. 
e. 
, if it is seen as a link in the chain whichextends from February 28 to August 29, it becomes clearthat the fault and the error of the Bolsheviks was theinsufficient revolutionism of their tactics, and by no means the excessive revolutionism the philistines, accuse us of. 
) The spontaneous nature of the movement leading to the proletariat beginning civil war is thus beyond doubt. 
 Onthe other hand, there is not even a trace of anything resem-bling spontaneity in the Kornilov revolt; it was merely aconspiracy of generals who hoped by fraud and by the force of military command to carry part of the army with them. 
 *See present edition, Vol. 
 25. 
— Ed. 
 It is beyond all doubt that the spontaneity of the move-ment is proof that it is deeply rooted in the masses, that its roots are firm and that it is inevitable. 
 The proletarian revolution is firmly rooted, the bourgeois counter-revolu-tion is without roots—this is what the facts prove if exam-ined from the point of view of the spontaneous nature of themovement. 
 Let us now look at the aims of the movement. 
 The move-ment of April 20-21 came very close to adopting the Bolshe-vik slogans, whereas that of July 3-4 was directly connectedwith them, was under their influence and guidance. 
 TheBolshevik Party spoke quite openly, definitely, clearly,precisely, for all to hear, in its papers and in verbal pro-paganda of the chief aims of the proletarian civil war— the dictatorship of the proletariat and the poor peasantry, peace and an immediate offer of peace, confiscation of thelanded estates. 
 We all know the aims of the Kornilov revolt, and no one among the democrats disputes that those aims were a dic-tatorship of the landowners and the bourgeoisie, dispersal of the Soviets, and preparations for the restoration of the monarchy. 
 The Cadet Party, this main Kornilovite party(by the way, it ought to be called from now on the Kor-nilov party), possesses a larger press and greater forcesfor propaganda than the Bolsheviks, but it has never daredand still does not dare to tell the people openly either about the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie or about the dispersal of the Soviets, or about the Kornilovite aims ingeneral! As far-as the aims of the movement are concerned, the facts tell us that the proletarian civil war can come outwith an open exposition of its final aims before the people and win the sympathies of the working people, whereas the bourgeois civil war can attempt to lead part of themasses only by concealing its aims; this is the tremendousdifference in them as far as the class-consciousness of themasses is concerned. 
 The only objective data on this question seem to be those on party affiliation and elections. 
 There do not appear to be any other facts which allow a clear judgement of theclass-consciousness of the masses. 
 It is clear that the pro-letarian-revolutionary movement is represented by the Bolshevik Party, and the bourgeois counter-revolutionary movement by the Cadet Party, and this can hardly be dis-puted after six months’ experience of the revolution. 
 Threecomparisons of a factual nature can be made that concernthe question under consideration. 
 A comparison of theMay elections to the local councils in Petrograd with theAugust elections to the city council shows a decrease in Cadet votes and a tremendous increase in Bolshevik votes. 
 The Cadet press admits that, as a rule, Bolshevism is strongwherever masses of workers or soldiers are concen-trated. 
 In the absence of any statistics concerning the fluctua-tion of the party membership, attendance at meetings, etc. 
, the conscious support of the party by the masses may be judged only from published data concerning cash collec-tions for the party. 
 These data show a tremendous mass-scale heroism on the part of worker Bolsheviks in collectingmoney for Pravda , 19 for the papers that have been sup-pressed, etc. 
 The reports of such collections have always been published. 
 Among the Cadets we see nothing of the kind; their party work is obviously being “nourished” bycontributions from the rich. 
 There is no trace of activeaid on the part of the masses. 
 Lastly, a comparison of the movements of April 20-21 and July 3-4 on the one hand, and the Kornilov revolt on the other, shows that the Bolsheviks indicated point-blank to the masses who their enemy in the civil war is, namely,the bourgeoisie, the landowners and capitalists. 
 The Kor-nilov revolt has already demonstrated that the troops whofollowed Kornilov did so because they had been completely deceived , a fact made obvious the moment the Savage Division and Kornilov’s contingents came up against the Petrograd masses. 
 Furthermore, what data indicate the strength of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the civil war? The Bolshe-viks are strong only in the numbers and class-consciousnessof the proletarians, in the sympathy with the Bolshevik slogans displayed by the Socialist-Revolutionary and Men-shevik “rank and file” (i. 
e. 
, workers and poor peasants). 
It is a fact that these slogans actually won over the majority of the active revolutionary masses in Petrograd on April 20-21, June 18,20 and July 3-4. 
 A comparison of the data on the “parliamentary” elec-tions and the data on the above-named mass movementsfully corroborates, in respect of Russia, an observationoften made in the West, namely, that the revolutionaryproletariat is incomparably stronger in the extra-parlia-mentary than in the parliamentary struggle, as far as influ-encing the masses and drawing them into the struggle is concerned. 
 This is a very important observation in respectof civil war. 
 It is quite clear why in all the circumstances and the entire situation of parliamentary struggle and electionsthe strength of the oppressed classes is less than the strength they can actually develop in civil war. 
 The strength of the Cadets and the Kornilov revolt is the strength of wealth . 
 The press and a long series of polit-ical actions show that Anglo-French capital and imperi-alism are in favour of the Cadets and the Kornilov movement. 
 It is common knowledge that the entire Right wing of the Moscow Conference 21 of August 12 gave frantic support to Kornilov and Kaledin. 
 It is common knowledge thatthe French and British bourgeois press “aided” Kornilov. 
There are indications of his having been aided by the banks . 
 All the power of wealth stood behind Kornilov—and what a miserable and rapid failure! There are only two social forces among Kornilov’s supporters apart from the wealthy—the Savage Division and the Cossacks. 
 In thecase of the former it is only the power of ignorance and deception, and this power is the more formidable the longerthe press remains in the hands of the bourgeoisie. 
 Aftera victory in the civil war, the proletariat would undermine this source of “power” once and for all. 
 As to the Cossacks, they are a section of the population consisting of rich, small or medium landed proprietors(the average holding is about 50 dessiatines) in one of thoseoutlying regions of Russia that have retained many medievaltraits in their way of life, their economy, and their customs. 
 We can regard this as the socio-economic basis for a Russian Vendée. 
 22 But what have the facts of the Kornilov-Kaledin movement proved? Not even Kaledin, the “beloved leader” supported by the Guchkovs, Milyukovs, Ryabushinskys and Co. 
, has succeeded in creating a mass movement!! Kaledin marched towards civil war much more “directly”, much more forthrightly than did the Bolsheviks. 
 Kaledinwent specifically “to rouse the Don”, and still he has notaroused a mass movement in his “home” region, in a Cossackregion far removed from Russian democracy in general. 
On the part of the proletariat, on the contrary, we observe spontaneous outbursts of the movement in the very centre of the influence and power of anti-Bolshevik, all-Russiademocracy. 
 Objective data on the attitude of various strata and economic groups of the Cossacks towards democracy andtowards the Kornilov revolt are lacking. 
 There are only indications to the effect that the majority of the poor and middle Cossacks are rather inclined towards democracyand that only the officers and the top layer of the well-to-doCossacks are entirely in favour of Kornilov. 
 However that may be, the extreme weakness of a mass Cossack movement in favour of a bourgeois counter-revolu-tion has been historically proved since the experience of August 26-31. 
 There remains the last question, that of the tenacity of the movement. 
 As far as the Bolshevik, proletarianrevolutionary movement is concerned, we have proof thatthe struggle against Bolshevism has been conducted during the six months’ existence of a republic in Russia both ideologically, with a gigantic preponderance of press organs and propaganda forces on the side of the opponents of Bol-shevism (even if we risk classing the campaign of slanderas “ideological” struggle), and by means of repressions , which include hundreds of people arrested, our main print-ing-plant demolished, and the chief newspaper and a number of other papers suppressed. 
 The result can be seen in thefacts—a tremendous growth of support for the Bolsheviksin the August Petrograd elections, and in both theSocialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik parties, a strengthen-ing of the internationalist and Left trends that are drawing close to Bolshevism. 
 This means that the tenacity of the proletarian revolutionary movement in republican Russiais very great. 
 The facts tell us that the combined efforts of the Cadets, the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Menshe-viks have not succeeded in weakening that movement in the least. 
 On the contrary, it was the alliance of the Kor-nilovites with “democracy” that strengthened Bolshevism. 
 The only possible means of struggle against the proletarianrevolutionary trend are ideological influence and repres-sions. 
 Data on the tenacity of the Cadet-Kornilov movement are still lacking. 
 The Cadets have suffered no persecution at all. 
 Even Guchkov has been set free and Maklakov andMilyukov were not even arrested. 
 Rech has not been sup-pressed. 
 The Cadets are being spared. 
 The Kornilovite Cadetsare being courted by Kerensky’s government. 
 Suppose we put it this way: assuming that the Anglo-French and the Russian Ryabushinskys will give millions and millions more to the Cadets, to Yedinstvo , 23 Dyen ,24 etc. 
, for the new election campaign in Petrograd, is it probable thatthe number of their votes will now increase, after the Kor-nilov revolt? Judging by meetings, etc. 
, the answer to thisquestion can hardly be anything but negative. 
 * * * Summing up the results of the analysis in which we com-pared the data furnished by the history of the Russianrevolution, we arrive at the conclusion that the beginning of the proletariat’s civil war has revealed the strength, the class-consciousness, deep-rootedness, growth, and te-nacity of the movement. 
 The beginning of the bourgeoisie’scivil war has revealed no strength, no class-consciousnessamong the masses, no depth whatsoever, no chance of victory. 
 The alliance of the Cadets with the Socialist-Revolu-tionaries and Mensheviks against the Bolsheviks, i. 
e. 
, against the revolutionary proletariat, has been tried inpractice for a number of months, and this alliance of thetemporarily disguised Kornilovites with the “democrats”has actually strengthened and not weakened the Bolshe-viks, and led to the collapse of the “alliance”, and to the strengthening of the Left opposition among the Mensheviks. 
 An alliance of the Bolsheviks with the Socialist-Revo-lutionaries and Mensheviks against the Cadets, against the bourgeoisie, has not yet been tried ; or, to be more pre-cise, such an alliance has been tried on one front only , for five days only, from August 26 to August 31, the period of the Kornilov revolt, and this alliance at that time scoreda victory over the counter-revolution with an ease neveryet achieved in any revolution; it was such a crushingsuppression of the bourgeois, landowners’, capitalist,Allied-imperialist and Cadet counter-revolution, that the civil war from that side ceased to exist, was a mere nothing from the very outset, collapsed before any “battle” had takenplace. 
 In the face of this historic fact the entire bourgeois press and all its chorus (the Plekhanovs, Potresovs, Breshko-Breshkovskayas, etc. 
) are shouting with all their might that an alliance of the Bolsheviks with the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries “threatens” the horrors ofcivil war! This would be funny, if it were not so sad. 
 It is sad indeed that such an open, self-evident, glaring absurdity, such aflouting of the facts of the whole history of our revolution, can still find listeners .... 
 This only proves that the selfish bourgeois lie is still widespread (and this cannot be avoidedas long as the press is monopolised by the bourgeoisie), alie that shouts down and drowns the most undoubted,palpably obvious lessons of the revolution. 
 If there is an absolutely undisputed lesson of the revo-lution, one fully proved by facts, it is that only an alliance of the Bolsheviks with the Socialist-Revolutionaries andMensheviks, only an immediate transfer of all power to theSoviets would make civil war in Russia impossible, for acivil war begun by the bourgeoisie against such an alliance,against the Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’ Deputies, is inconceivable; such a “war” would not last even until the first battle; the bourgeoisie, for the second time since the Kornilov revolt, would not be able to move even the Savage Division, or the former number of Cossackunits against the Soviet Government! The peaceful development of any revolution is, generally speaking, extremely rare and difficult, because revolution is the maximum exacerbation of the sharpest classcontradictions; but in a peasant country, at a time when a union of the proletariat with the peasantry can give peace to people worn out by a most unjust and criminal war, when that union can give the peasantry all the land , in that country, at that exceptional moment in history, apeaceful development of the revolution is possible and probable if all power is transferred to the Soviets. 
 The struggle of parties for power within the Soviets may proceedpeacefully, if the Soviets are made fully democratic, and “petty thefts” and violations of democratic principles, such as giving the soldiers one representative to every five hun-dred, while the workers have one representative to everythousand voters, are eliminated. 
 In a democratic republicsuch petty thefts will have to disappear. 
 When confronted with Soviets that have given all the land to the peasants without compensation and offer a just peace to all the peoples—when confronted with suchSoviets the alliance of the British, French and Russianbourgeoisie, the Kornilovs, Buchanans, 25 Ryabushinskys, Milyukovs, Plekhanovs, and Potresovs is quite impotentand is not to be feared. 
 The bourgeoisie’s resistance to the transfer of the land to the peasants without compensation, to similar reformsin other realms of life, to a just peace and a break withimperialism, is, of course, inevitable. 
 But for such resis-tance to reach the stage of civil war, masses of some kind are necessary, masses capable of fighting and vanquishing the Soviets. 
 The bourgeoisie does not have these masses, and has nowhere to get them. 
 The sooner and the moreresolutely the Soviets take all power, the sooner both Sav-age Divisions and Cossacks will split into an insignificantminority of politically-conscious Kornilov supporters anda huge majority of those in favour of a democratic and socialist (for it is with socialism that we shall then be dealing) alliance of workers and peasants. 
 When power passes to the Soviets, the resistance of the bourgeoisie will result in scores and hundreds of workers and peasants “keeping track of”, supervising, controlling,and registering every single capitalist, for the interests of the workers and peasants will demand struggle against the capitalists’ deception of the people. 
 The forms andmethods of this accountancy and control have been devel-oped and simplified by capitalism itself, by such capital-ist creations as banks, big factories, trusts, railways, the post office, consumers’ societies, and trade unions. 
 If the Soviets punish those capitalists who evade the most detailedaccounting or who deceive the people, punish them byconfiscating all their property and arresting them for ashort time, that will be sufficient to break all the resistanceof the bourgeoisie by bloodless means. 
 For it is through the banks, once they are nationalised, through the unions of employees, through the post office, the consumers’ soci-eties, and the trade unions, that control and the accountingwill become universal, all-powerful, and irresistible. 
 And Russia’s Soviets, the alliance of her workers and poor peasants, are not alone in the steps they take towards socialism. 
 If we were alone, we should not be able to accomplish this task peacefully, for it is essentially an inter-national task. 
 But we have enormous reserves, the armiesof the most advanced workers in other countries, whereRussia’s break with imperialism and the imperialist warwill inevitably accelerate the workers’ socialist revolution that is maturing. 
 * * * Some speak about “rivers of blood” in a civil war. 
 This is mentioned in the resolution of the Kornilovite Cadetsquoted above. 
 This phrase is repeated in a thousand ways by all the bourgeois and opportunists. 
 Since the Kornilov revolt all the class-conscious workers laugh, will continueto laugh and cannot help laughing at it. 
 However, the question of “rivers of blood” in the present time of war can and must be studied by an approximatecomputation of forces, consequences, and results; it must be taken seriously and not as an empty stock phrase, not as simply the hypocrisy of the Cadets, who have done every-thing in their power to enable Kornilov to drown Russia in “rivers of blood”, and to restore the dictatorship of thebourgeoisie, the power of the landowners, and the monarchy. 
 “Rivers of blood,” they say. 
 Let us analyse this aspect of the question as well. 
 Let us assume that the vacillations of the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries continue; that these parties do not hand over power to the Soviets; that they do not overthrow Kerensky; that they restore the old rotten com-promise with the bourgeoisie in a somewhat different form (say, “non-partisan” Kornilovites instead of Cadets); that they do not replace the apparatus of state power by theSoviet apparatus, do not offer peace, do not break withimperialism, and do not confiscate the landed estates. 
 Letus assume that this is the outcome of the present wavering of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, of this present “September 12”. 
 The experience of our own revolution tells us most clearly that the consequence of this would be a still furtherweakening of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks,their further separation from the masses, an incredible growth of indignation and bitterness among the masses, a tremendous growth of sympathy with the revolutionaryproletariat, with the Bolsheviks. 
 Under such conditions, the proletariat of the capital will be still closer to a Commune, to a workers’ uprising,to the conquest of power, to a civil war in its highest and most decisive form, than it is at present; after the experi-ence of April 20-21 and July 3-4 such a result must berecognised as historically inevitable. 
 “Rivers of blood,” shout the Cadets. 
 But such rivers of blood would give victory to the proletariat and the poorpeasantry, and it is a hundred to one that this victory would bring peace in place of the imperialist war, i. 
e. 
, that it would save the lives of hundreds of thousands of men who are now shedding their blood for the sake of a divisionof spoils and seizures (annexations) by the capitalists. 
If April 20-21 had ended by the transfer of all power to theSoviets, and the Bolsheviks in alliance with the poor peasantry had won in the Soviets, it would have saved the lives of the half million Russian soldiers, who certainly perished in the battles of June 18, even if it had cost “riversof blood”. 
 This is how every class-conscious Russian worker and soldier figures, this is how he must figure, if he weighs and analyses the question of civil war now being raised everywhere; and, of course, such a worker or soldier, whohas experienced many things and given thought to them, will not be frightened by the cries of “rivers of blood” raised by individuals, parties and groups willing to sacrifice more millions of Russian soldiers for the sake of Constan-tinople, Lvov, Warsaw, and “victory over Germany”. 
 No “rivers of blood” in an internal civil war can even approximately equal those seas of blood which the Russian imperialists have shed since June 19 (in spite of the verygreat chances they had of avoiding this by handing over power to the Soviets). 
 All you Milyukovs, Potresovs and Plekhanovs be careful about your arguments against “rivers of blood” in civil war while this present war continues, for the soldiers haveseen seas of blood and know what they mean. 
 The international situation of the Russian revolution now, in 1917, the fourth year of a terrifically burdensome and criminal war, that has worn out the peoples, is suchthat an offer of a just peace on the part of a Russian pro-letariat victorious in the civil war would have a hundredto one chance of achieving an armistice and peace without the shedding of further seas of blood . 
 For a combination of warring Anglo-French and German imperialism against the proletarian socialist Russian Republic is impossible in practice, while a combination of British, Japanese and American imperialism against us isextremely difficult to realise and is not at all dangerousto us, if only because of Russia’s geographical position. 
 On the other hand, the existence of revolutionary and socialist proletarian masses in all the European states is a fact; the maturing and the inevitability of the world-wide socialist revolution is beyond doubt, and such a revo-lution can be seriously aided only by the progress of theRussian revolution and not by delegations and not by play-ing at Stockholm conferences with the foreign Plekhanovs or Tseretelis. 
 The bourgeoisie wails about the inevitable defeat of a Commune in Russia, i. 
e. 
, defeat of the proletariat if itwere to conquer power. 
 These are false, selfish class wailings. 
 If the proletariat gains power it will have every chance of retaining it and of leading Russia until there is a vic-torious revolution in the West. 
 In the first place, we have learned much since the Com-mune, and we would not repeat its fatal errors, we would not leave the banks in the hands of the bourgeoisie, we would not confine ourselves to defence against the Versaillais(or the Kornilovites) but would take the offensive againstthem and crush them. 
 Secondly, the victorious proletariat would give Russia peace, and no power on earth would be able to overthrow a government of peace , a government of an honest, sincere, just peace, after all the horrors of more than three years’butchery of the peoples. 
 Thirdly, the victorious proletariat would give the peas-antry the land immediately and without compensation. 
And a tremendous majority of the peasantry—worn out and embittered by the “playing around with the landowners” practised by our government, particularly the coalitiongovernment, particularly the Kerensky government—wouldsupport the victorious proletariat absolutely, unreservedly,with every means in its power. 
 You Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries are all talking about the “heroic efforts” of the people. 
 Only recently I came across this phrase for the nth time in theleading article of your Izvestia 26 of the Central Executive Committee. 
 With you it is a mere phrase. 
 But the workers and peasants read it and think about it, and such delibera-tion—reinforced by the experience of the Kornilov revolt, by the “experience” of Peshekhonov’s ministry, by the “experience” of Chernov’s ministry, and so forth —every such deliberation inevitably leads to the conclusion thatthis “heroic effort” is nothing but confidence of the poorpeasantry in the city workers as their most faithful alliesand leaders. 
 The heroic effort is nothing but the victory of the Russian proletariat over the bourgeoisie in civil war, for such a victory alone will save the country frompainful vacillations, it alone will show the way out, italone will give land and peace. 
 If an alliance between the city workers and the poor peasantry can be effected through an immediate transfer of power to the Soviets, so much the better. 
 The Bolsheviks will do everything to secure this peaceful development of the revolution. 
 Without this, even the Constituent Assem-bly, by itself, will not save the situation, for even there the Socialist-Revolutionaries may continue their “playing” at agreements with the Cadets, with Breshko-Breshkovskaya and Kerensky (in what way are they better than Cadets?),and so on, and so forth. 
 If even the experience of the Kornilov revolt has taught the “democrats” nothing, and they continue the destructivepolicy of vacillation and compromise, we say that nothing is more ruinous to the proletarian revolution than these vacillations. 
 That being the case, do not frighten us, gen-tlemen, with civil war. 
 Civil war is inevitable, if you donot wish to break with Kornilovism and the “coalition”right now, once and for all. 
 This war will bring victoryover the exploiters, it will give the land to the peasants, it will give peace to the peoples, it will open the right road to the victorious revolution of the world socialistproletariat.

 Lenin HEROE S OF FRAUD AND THE MISTAKE S OF THE BOLSHEVI KS27 The so-called Democratic Conference is over. 
 Thank God, one more farce is behind us and still we are advanc-ing, provided fate has no more than a certain number of farces in store for our revolution. 
 In order correctly to judge the political results of the Conference, we must attempt to ascertain its precise classsignificance as indicated by objective facts. 
 Further break-up of the government parties, the Social-ist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks; their obvious lossof the majority among the revolutionary democrats; onemore step towards linking up Mr. 
 Kerensky and Messrs. 
Tsereteli, Chernov and Co. 
 and exposing the Bonapartismthey share—such is the class significance of the Conference. 
 In the Soviets, the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Men-sheviks have lost their majority. 
 They therefore have hadto resort to a fraud—they have violated their pledge to calla new congress of the Soviets in three months. 
 They haveevaded reporting back to those who elected the CentralExecutive Committee of the Soviets; and they have riggedthe “Democratic” Conference. 
 The Bolsheviks spoke of this fraud prior to the Conference, and the results fully confirmed their correctness. 
 The Lieberdans 28 and the Tseretelis, Chernovs and Co. 
 saw that their majority in the Sovietswas dwindling, therefore they resorted to a fraud. 
 Arguments like that which says that co-operatives and also “properly” elected city and Zemstvo representatives “are already of great significance among the democratic organisations”, are so flimsy that it is nothing but crass hypocrisy to advance them seriously. 
 First of all, the Central Executive Committee was elected by the Soviets, and its refusal to deliver a report and relinquish office to the Soviets , is a Bonapartist fraud. 
 Secondly, the Soviets represent revolutionary democracy insofar as they are joinedby those who wish to fight in a revolutionary way. 
 Theirdoors are not closed to members of the co-operatives andcity dwellers. 
 Those same Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks ran the Soviets. 
 Those who remained only in the co-operatives, who confined themselves only to municipal (city and Zemstvo) work, voluntarily separated themselves from the ranks ofrevolutionary democracy, thereby attaching themselves toa democracy that was either reactionary or neutral. 
 Every-body knows that co-operative and municipal work is done not only by revolutionaries, but also by reactionaries; everybody knows that people are elected to co-operativesand municipalities primarily for work that is not of general political scope and importance. 
 The aim of the Lieberdans, Tsereteli, Chernov and Co. 
 when they rigged the Conference was to bring up reserves secretly from among the adherents of Yedinstvo and “non-partisan” reactionaries. 
 That was the fraud they perpe-trated. 
 That was their Bonapartism, which allies them withthe Bonapartist Kerensky. 
 They robbed democracy whilehypocritically keeping up democratic appearances—this is the essence of the matter. 
 Nicholas II stole, figuratively, large sums from democra-cy. 
 He convened representative institutions but gavethe landowners a hundredfold greater representation thanthe peasants. 
 The Lieberdans, Tseretelis, and Chernovssteal petty sums from democracy; they convoke a Demo-cratic Conference where both workers and peasants point with full justice to the curtailment of their representation,to lack of proportionality, to discrimination in favour of members of the co-operatives and municipal councilsclosest to the bourgeoisie (and reactionary democracy). 
 The Lieberdans, Tseretelis and Chernovs have parted ways with the masses of poor workers and peasants. 
 They saved themselves by the fraud that keeps their Kerenskygoing. 
 The demarcation of classes is progressing. 
 A protest is growing in the Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik parties, a direct split is maturing because the “leaders” have betrayed the interests of the majority of the popula-tion. 
 The leaders are relying on the support of a minority , in defiance of the principles of democracy. 
 Fraud is inevi-table as far as they are concerned. 
 Kerensky is revealing himself more and more as a Bona-partist. 
 He was considered a Socialist-Revolutionary. 
 Now we know that he is not merely a “March” Socialist-Revolutionary who ran over to them from the Trudoviks“for advertising purposes”. 
 He is an adherent of Breshko-Breshkovskaya, the Socialist-Revolutionary Mrs. 
 Plekha-nov, or Mrs. 
 Potresov in their Dyen . 
 The so-called Right wing of the so-called socialist parties, the Plekhanovs, Breshkovskayas, Potresovs, is where Kerensky belongs ; this wing, however, does not differ substantially from theCadets in anything . 
 The Cadets have good reason to praise Kerensky. 
 He pursues their policies and confers with them and with Rodzyanko behind the back of the people ; he has been ex-posed by Chernov and others as conniving with Savinkov,a friend of Kornilov’s. 
 Kerensky is a Kornilovite ; by sheer accident he has had a quarrel with Kornilov himself, but he remains in the most intimate alliance with other Kor-nilovites. 
 This is a fact, proved by the revelations about Savinkov, by Dyelo Naroda and by the continuation of the political game, Kerensky’s “ministerial leapfrog” withthe Kornilovites disguised under the name of the “com-mercial and industrial class”. 
 Secret pacts with the Kornilov gang, secret hobnobbing (through Tereshchenko and Co. 
) with the imperialist “Allies”; secret obstruction and sabotage of the Constituent Assembly; secret deception of the peasants by way of serviceto Rodzyanko, i. 
e. 
, the landowners (by doubling the priceof bread)—this is what Kerensky is really doing. 
 This is his class policy. 
 This is his Bonapartism. 
 To conceal this from the Conference, the Lieberdans, Tseretelis and Chernovs had to resort to a fraud. 
 The Bolshevik participation in this hideous fraud, in this farce, had the same justification as their participa-tion in the Third Duma29; even in a “pigsty” we must uphold our line, even from a “pigsty” we must send out material exposing the enemy for the instruction of the people. 
 The difference, however, is this, that the Third Duma was convened when the revolution was obviously ebbing,while at present there is an obvious upsurge of a new revolu-tion ; of the scope and the pace of this upsurge, however, we unfortunately know very little. 
 * * * The most characteristic episode of the Conference was, in my opinion, Zarudny’s speech. 
 He tells us that as soon as Kerensky “as much as hinted” at reorganising the government, all the ministers began to hand in their resig-nations. 
 “The following day,” continues the naïve, child-ishly naïve (a good thing if he is only naïve), Zarudny, “the following day, notwithstanding our resignation, wewere called, we were consulted, and finally we were pre-vailed upon to stay. 
” “General laughter in the hall,” remarks at this point the official Izvestia . 
 Gay folk, those participants in the Bonapartist decep-tion of the people by the republicans. 
 We are all revolu-tionary democrats—no joking! “From the very beginning,” says Zarudny, “we heard two things; we were to strive to make the army capable of fighting, and to hasten peace on a democratic basis. 
 Well, as far as peace is concerned, I do not know whether, during the six weeks I have been a member of theProvisional Government, the Provisional Government has done any-thing about it. 
 I did not notice it. 
 ( Applause and a voice from the audi-ence : “It did nothing”, Izvestia remarks. 
) When I, as a member of the Provisional Government, inquired about it, I received no reply .... 
” Thus speaks Zarudny, according to the report of the official Izvestia . 
 And the Conference listen in silence, tol-erate such things, do not stop the orator, do not interruptthe session, do not jump to their feet and chase out Kerensky and the government! How could they? These “revolutionary democrats” are for Kerensky to a man! Very well, gentlemen, but then, wherein does the term /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR “revolutionary democrat” differ from the terms “lackey” and “scoundrel”? It is natural that these lackeys are capable of roaring with laughter when “their” Minister, noted for his rarenaïveté or rare stupidity, tells them how Kerensky keepsremoving and replacing ministers (in order to come toterms with the Kornilov gang behind the hack of the peopleand “in full privacy”). 
 It is not surprising that the lackeys keep silent when “their” Minister, who seems to have taken general phrases about peace seriously without seeing theirhypocrisy, admits that he did not even receive a reply tohis question about real steps towards peace. 
 Such is thefate of lackeys, to allow themselves to be fooled by thegovernment. 
 But what has this to do with revolution, what has it to do with democracy? Would it be surprising if revolutionary soldiers and workers were to get the idea that it would be good if theceiling of the Alexandrinsky Theatre were to fall and crushall that gang of pitiful scoundrels who can sit there insilence when it is being demonstrated to them that Kerensky and Co. 
 are fooling them with their talk about peace, who can roar with laughter when they are told asclearly as can be by their own ministers that ministerialleapfrog is a farce (concealing Kerensky’s dealings with theKornilovites). 
 God save us from our friends, we can copewith our enemies ourselves! God save us from these claimants to revolutionary democratic leadership, we can cope with the Kerenskys, Cadets and Kornilovites ourselves! * * * And now I come to the errors of the Bolsheviks. 
 To have confined themselves to ironic applause and exclamations at such a moment was an error. 
 The people are weary of vacillations and delays. 
 Dis-satisfaction is obviously growing. 
 A new revolution is ap-proaching. 
 The reactionary democrats, the Lieberdans, Tsere-telis and others, wish only to distract the attention of the people with their farce of a “conference”, keep them busy with it, cut the Bolsheviks off from the masses, and provide the Bolshevik delegates with the unworthy occupation of sitting and listening to the Zarudnys! And the Zarudnys are not the least sincere of them! The Bolsheviks should have walked out of the meeting in protest and not allowed themselves to be caught by theconference trap set to divert the people’s attention fromserious questions. 
 The Bolsheviks should have left two orthree of their 136 delegates for “liaison work”, that is, toreport by telephone the moment the idiotic babbling came to an end and the voting began. 
 They should not have allowed themselves to be kept busy with obvious nonsense for the obvious purpose of deceiving the people with the obviousaim of extinguishing the growing revolution by wasting time on trivial matters. 
 Ninety-nine per cent of the Bolshevik delegation ought to have gone to the factories and barracks; that was the proper place for delegates who had come from all endsof Russia and who, after Zarudny’s speech, could see thefull depth of the Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevikrottenness. 
 There, closer to the masses, at hundreds andthousands of meetings and talks, they ought to have dis-cussed the lessons of this farcical conference whose obvious purpose was only to give a respite to the KorniloviteKerensky and make it easier for him to try new variationsof the “ministerial leapfrog” game. 
 The Bolsheviks, it turned out, had a wrong attitude to parliamentarism in moments of revolutionary (and not constitutional) crises, an incorrect attitude to the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks. 
 How it happened can be understood—history made a very sharp turn at the time of the Kornilov revolt. 
 The Partyfailed to keep pace with the incredibly fast tempo of his-tory at this turning-point. 
 The Party allowed itself to be diverted, for the time being, into the trap of a despicable talking-shop. 
 They should have left one hundredth of their forces for that talking-shop and devoted ninety-nine hundredthsto the masses . 
 If the turn taken by history called for a compromise with the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks (personally I believe it did) the Bolsheviks should have proposed itclearly, openly and speedily, so that they could immediate-ly turn to account the possible and probable refusal of the Bonapartist Kerensky’s friends to agree to a compromise with them. 
 The refusal was already indicated by articles in Dyelo Naroda and Rabochaya Gazeta on the eve of the Conference. 
 The masses should have been told as officially, openlyand clearly as possible, they should have been told withoutthe loss of a minute , that the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks had rejected our offer of a compromise— Down with the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks!The Conference could have afforded “to laugh” at the naïvetéof Zarudny to the accompaniment of this slogan in the factories and barracks! The atmosphere of a certain enthusiasm for the Confer-ence and the situation surrounding it seems to have been built up from various sides. 
 Comrade Zinoviev made amistake in writing about the Commune so ambiguously(ambiguously, to say the least) that it appeared that theCommune, although victorious in Petrograd, might bedefeated as in France in 1871 . 
 This is absolutely untrue. 
 If the Commune were victorious in Petrograd it would be victorious throughout Russia. 
 It was a mistake on his part to write that the Bolsheviks did right in proposing aproportional composition for the Presidium of the Petro-grad Soviet. 
 The revolutionary proletariat would never doanything worth while in the Soviet as long as the Tseretelis were allowed proportional participation; to let them in meant depriving ourselves of the opportunity to work, it meant the ruin of Soviet work. 
 Comrade Kamenev was wrong in delivering the first speech at the Conference in apurely “constitutional” spirit when he raised the foolishquestion of confidence or non-confidence in the govern-ment. 
 If, at such a meeting, it was not possible to tell the truth about the Kornilovite Kerensky that had already been told both in Rabochy Put 30 and the Moscow Sotsial-Demokrat ,31 why not refer to those papers and make it well known to the masses that the Conference did not want to listen to the truth about the Kornilovite Kerensky? It was a mistake on the part of the Petrograd workers’ delegations to send speakers to such a conference after Zarudny had spoken and the situation had been made clear. 
 Why cast pearls before Kerensky’s friends? Why divert the attention of proletarian forces to a farcical conference? Why did those delegations not go quite peacefully andlegally to the barracks and the more backward factories?That would have been a million times more useful, essen-tial, serious and to the point than the journey to the Alexan-drinsky Theatre and chats with co-operators who sympathise with Yedinstvo and Kerensky. 
 Ten soldiers or ten workers from a backward factory who have become politically enlightened are worth a thousand times more than a hundred delegates hand-picked from vari-ous delegations by the Lieberdans. 
 Parliamentarism shouldbe used, especially in revolutionary times, not to waste valuable time over representatives of what is rotten, but to use the example of what is rotten to teach the masses . 
 Why should those same proletarian delegations not “use” the Conference to publish, say, two posters explainingthat the Conference is a farce and to display them in barracks and factories? One of the posters could depict Zarudny in a fool’s cap, dancing on the stage and singing the song“Kerensky sacked us, Kerensky took us back ”. 
 Around him stand Tsereteli, Chernov, Skobelev and a co-operator arm-in-arm with Lieber and Dan, all rolling with laughter. 
Caption— They are Happy . 
 Poster number two. 
 Zarudny again in front of the same audience saying “I asked about peace for six weeks. 
 I got no answer ”. 
 The audience is silent, their faces express “statesmanlike importance”. 
 Tsereteli looks particularlyimportant as he writes in his notebook “What a fool thatZarudny is! The imbecile should be carting dung instead of being a minister. 
 He is an advocate of the coalition and undermines it worse than a hundred Bolsheviks! He was aminister but he never learned to speak like one, he shouldhave said, ‘I continuously followed the campaign for peacefor six weeks and I am fully convinced of its final successprecisely under the coalition government in accordance with the great idea of Stockholm, etc. 
, etc. 
’ Then even Russkaya Volya 32 would have praised Zarudny as the knight of the Russian revolution.

 Lenin A PUBLICIST ’S DIARY THE MISTAKES OF OUR PARTY Friday, September 22, 1917. 
 The more one reflects on the meaning of the so-called Democratic Conference, and the more attentively oneobserves from outside—and it is said that the bystandersees most—the more firmly convinced one becomes that ourParty committed a mistake by participating in it. 
 We should have boycotted it. 
 One may ask if there is any use in analysing such a question since the past cannot be rem-edied. 
 Such an objection to criticising the tactics of yester-day, however, would be clearly unfounded. 
 We have alwayscondemned, and as Marxists we must condemn, the tacticsof those who live “from hand to mouth”. 
 Momentary success is not enough for us. 
 In general, plans calculated for a minute or a day are not enough for us. 
 We must constantlytest ourselves by a study of the chain of political events in their entirety, in their causal connection, in their results. 
By analysing the errors of yesterday, we learn to avoiderrors today and tomorrow. 
 A new revolution is obviously maturing in the country, a revolution of other classes (other than those that carried out the revolution against tsarism). 
 At that time it was arevolution of the proletariat, the peasantry and the bour-geoisie in alliance with Anglo-French finance capital againsttsarism. 
 The revolution now maturing is one of the proletariat and the majority of the peasants, more specifically, of thepoor peasants, against the bourgeoisie, against its ally, Anglo-French finance capital and against its government apparatus headed by the Bonapartist Kerensky. 
 At the moment we shall not dwell on the facts testifying to the rise of a new revolution, since, judging by thearticles in Rabochy Put , our Central Organ, the Party has already made clear its views on this point. 
 The new revo-lutionary upsurge seems to be a phenomenon commonlyrecognised by the Party. 
 Data on this process of maturing, of course, still have to be summarised, but they must form the subject of other articles. 
 At the present moment it is more important to call the closest attention to the class differences between the oldrevolution and the new, to weigh up the political situationand our tasks from the point of view of this basic fact, class relations. 
 At the time of the first revolution the vanguard was formed by the workers and soldiers, i. 
e. 
, by the prole-tariat and the advanced sections of the peasantry. 
 This vanguard carried along not only many of the worst vacillating elements of the petty bourgeoisie (rememberthe indecision of the Mensheviks and Trudoviks on the question of a republic), but also the monarchist party of the Cadets, the liberal bourgeoisie, thereby making it a re-publican party. 
 Why was such a change possible? Because economic domination is everything to the bour-geoisie, and the form of political domination is of verylittle importance; the bourgeoisie can rule just as well under a republic, its domination is even more certain under a republic, in the sense that under a republican politicalorder, no changes in the composition of the government orin the composition and the grouping of the ruling partiesaffect the bourgeoisie. 
 Of course, the bourgeoisie stood for and will stand for a monarchy, because the cruder armed protection of capital by monarchist institutions is more obvious and “closer”to all the capitalists and landowners. 
 However, under astrong pressure “from below”, the bourgeoisie has alwaysand everywhere “reconciled” itself to a republic, as long asit could maintain its economic domination. 
 The relation of the proletariat and the poor peasantry, i. 
e. 
, the majority of the people, in respect of the bour-geoisie and Allied (and world) imperialism is such that it is impossible for them to “ carry ” the bourgeoisie with them . 
 Moreover, the upper strata of the petty bourgeoisie and the more well-to-do strata of the democratic petty bourgeoisie are patently against a new revolution. 
 This fact is soobvious that there is no need to dwell on it here. 
 TheLieberdans, Tseretelis and Chernovs illustrate this mostclearly. 
 The class relations have changed. 
 This is the crux of the matter. 
 Different classes now stand “on the one and the other side of the barricade”. 
 That is the main thing. 
That, and that alone , is the scientific reason for speaking of a new revolution which—arguing purely theoretically, taking the question in the abstract—could be accomplished legally if, for instance, the Constituent Assembly, convokedby the bourgeoisie, produced a majority opposed to thebourgeoisie, if the majority belonged to the parties of theworkers and poor peasants. 
 The objective relations of the classes, their role (eco-nomic and political) outside and inside representative institutions of the given type; the rise or decline of therevolution; the relation of extra-parliamentary to parlia-mentary means of struggle—these are the chief, the basicobjective facts which must be considered if the tacticsof boycott or participation are to be deduced in a Marxist way and not arbitrarily, according to our “sym-pathies”. 
 The experience of our revolution clearly demonstrates how to approach the boycott question in a Marxist way. 
 Why did the boycott of the Bulygin Duma 33 prove cor-rect tactics? Because it was in accordance with the objective align-ment of social forces in their development. 
 It providedthe maturing revolution with a slogan for the overthrow ofan old order which, to distract the people from the revolution,was convoking a clumsily fabricated compromise institution(the Bulygin Duma) which did not show promise of any earnest “anchoring” in parliamentarism. 
 The extra-parlia-mentary means of struggle of the proletariat and the peas-antry were stronger. 
 These are the elements that went into shaping the correct tactics of boycotting the Bulygin Duma, tactics which took account of the objective situa-tion. 
 Why did the tactics of boycotting the Third Duma prove incorrect? Because they were based only on the “catchiness” of the boycott slogan and on the revulsion felt towards thebrutal reaction of the June Third “pigsty”. 
 34 The objective situation, however, was such that on the one hand the revolution was in a state of collapse and declining fast. 
For the upsurge of the revolution a parliamentary base(even inside a “pigsty”) was of tremendous political impor-tance, since extra-parliamentary means of propaganda,agitation and organisation were almost nonexistent or extremely weak. 
 On the other hand, the most openly reac-tionary nature of the Third Duma did not prevent it frombeing an organ reflecting real class relations, namely, theStolypin 35 combination of the monarchy and the bourgeoi-sie. 
 This new relation of classes was something the countryhad to get rid of. 
 These very elements shaped the tactics of participation in the Third Duma that took proper account of the objec-tive situation. 
 It is sufficient to give thought to these lessons gained from experience and the conditions required by a Marxistapproach to the question of boycott or participation, to realise that participation in the Democratic Conference, the Democratic Council or the Pre-parliament would bewrong tactics. 
 On the one hand, a new revolution is maturing. 
 The war is on the upgrade. 
 The extra-parliamentary means ofpropaganda, agitation and organisation are tremendous. 
 The “parliamentary” tribune in the given Pre-parliament is insignificant. 
 On the other hand, this Pre-parliament neitherreflects nor serves a new relation of classes; for instance,the peasantry is here more poorly represented than in the already existing organs (Soviets of Peasants’ Deputies). 
The Pre-parliament is in substance a Bonapartist fraud , not only because the filthy gang of the Lieberdans, Tsere-telis and Chernovs, together with Kerensky and Co. 
 have given this Tsereteli-Bulygin Duma a fake , hand-picked composition, but also more profoundly because the only aim of the Pre-parliament is to trick the masses, to deceive the workers and peasants, to distract them from the new upsurge of the revolution, to dazzle the eyes of theoppressed classes by a new dress for the old, long tried-out, bedraggled, threadbare “coalition” with the bourgeoisie (i. 
e. 
,the bourgeoisie’s transformation of Tsereteli and Co. 
 intojesters helping to subordinate the people to imperialism and the imperialist war). 
 “We are weak now,” said the tsar in August 1905 to his feudal landowners. 
 “Our power is wavering. 
 The tide ofthe workers’ and peasants’ revolution is rising. 
 We musttrick the ‘plain man’, we must dangle something before hiseyes.... 
” “We are weak now,” says the present “tsar”, the Bona-partist Kerensky, to the Cadets, the non-party Tit Tity-ches, 36 Plekhanovs, Breshkovskayas and Co. 
 “Our power is tottering. 
 A wave of workers’ and peasants’ revolutionagainst the bourgeoisie is rising. 
 We must hoodwink thedemocrats by dying in new colours that jester’s costume which the Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik ‘leaders of revolutionary democracy’, our dear friends the Tseretelisand Chernovs, have been wearing to fool the people sinceMay 6, 1917. 
 37 We can easily dangle a ‘Pre-parliament’ before their eyes. 
” “We are strong now,” said the tsar to his feudal land-owners in June 1907. 
 “The wave of workers’ and peasants’ revolution is receding, but we cannot maintain ourselvesas of old; deception alone will not suffice. 
 We must have anew policy in the village, we must have a new economicand political bloc with the Guchkovs and Milyukovs,with the bourgeoisie. 
” It is in this way that the three situations, August 1905, September 1917, and June 1907, may be presented to illus-trate most vividly the objective basis for the boycotttactics and its connection with class relations. 
 The oppressedclasses are always being deceived by the oppressors, butthe meaning of this deception differs at different moments in history. 
 Tactics cannot be based on the bare fact that the oppressors deceive the people; tactics must be shapedafter analysing class relations in their entirety and the development of both extra-parliamentary and parliamentary struggle. 
 Participation in the Pre-parliament is incorrect tactics that does not correspond to the objective relations of classes,to the objective conditions of the moment. 
 We should have boycotted the Democratic Conference; we all erred by not doing so, but mistakes are no crime. 
We shall correct the mistake only if we have a sincere desire to support the revolutionary struggle of the masses, only if we give earnest thought to the objective foundationsof our tactics. 
 We must boycott the Pre-parliament. 
 We must leave it and go to the Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’Deputies, to the trade unions, to the masses in general. 
 We must call on them to struggle. 
 We must give them a correct and clear slogan: disperse the Bonapartist gang ofKerensky and his fake Pre-parliament, with this Tsereteli-Bulygin Duma. 
 The Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolution-aries, even after the Kornilov revolt, refused to acceptour compromise of peacefully transferring the power to the Soviets (in which we then had no majority); they have again sunk into the morass of filthy and mean bargainingwith the Cadets. 
 Down with the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries! Struggle against them ruthlessly. 
 Expelthem ruthlessly from all revolutionary organisations. 
 Nonegotiations, no communication with those friends of the Kishkins , the friends of the Kornilovite landowners and capitalists. 
 Saturday, September 23. 
 Trotsky was for the boycott. 
 Bravo, Comrade Trotsky! Boycottism was defeated in the Bolshevik group at the Democratic Conference. 
 Long live the boycott!We cannot and must not under any circumstances recon-cile ourselves to participation. 
 A group at one of the con-ferences is not the highest organ of the party and even the decisions of the highest organs are subject to revision on the basis of experience. 
 We must at all costs strive to have the boycott question solved both at a plenary meeting of the Executive Committee and at an extraordinary Party congress. 
 The boycott question must now be made the platform for elections to the Congress and for all elections inside the Party. 
 We must draw the masses into the discussion of this question. 
 Class-conscious workers must take the matter into their ownhands, organise the discussion, and exert pressure on “thoseat the top”. 
 There is not the slightest doubt that at the “top” of our Party there are noticeable vacillations that may becomeruinous , because the struggle is developing; under certain conditions, at a certain moment, vacillations may ruin the cause. 
 We must put all our forces into the struggle,we must uphold the correct line of the party of the revo-lutionary proletariat before it is too late. 
 Not all is well with the “parliamentary” leaders of our Party; greater attention must be paid to them, there mustbe greater workers’ supervision over them; the competencyof parliamentary groups must be more clearly defined. 
 Our Party’s mistake is obvious. 
 The fighting party of the advanced class need not fear mistakes. 
 What it should fear is persistence in a mistake, refusal to admit and correcta mistake out of a false sense of shame. 
 Sunday, September 24. 
 The Congress of Soviets has been postponed till October 20. 
 The tempo of Russian life is such that this almost meanspostponing it to the Greek Calends. 
 The farce staged by theSocialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks after April 20-21is being repeated for the second time. 
 First published in Published according the magazine Proletarskaya to a typewritten copy Revolutsia No. 
 3 (26), 1924 THE TASKS OF THE REVOLUTION Russia is a country of the petty bourgeoisie, by far the greater part of the population belonging to this class. 
 Its vacillations between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat are inevitable, and only when it joins the proletariat isthe victory of the revolution, of the cause of peace, freedom,and land for the working people assured easily, peacefully,quickly, and smoothly. 
 The course of our revolution shows us these vacillations in practice. 
 Let us then not harbour any illusions about the Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik parties; letus stick firmly to the path of our proletarian class. 
 Thepoverty of the poor peasants, the horrors of the war, thehorrors of hunger—all these are showing the masses moreand more clearly the correctness of the proletarian path, the need to support the proletarian revolution. 
 The “peaceful” hopes of the petty bourgeoisie that there might be a “coalition” with the bourgeoisie and agreementswith them, that it will be possible to wait “calmly” forthe “speedy” convocation of the Constituent Assembly,etc. 
, have been mercilessly, cruelly, implacably destroyed by the course of the revolution. 
 The Kornilov revolt was the last cruel lesson, a lesson on a grand scale, supplementingthousands upon thousands of small lessons in which workersand peasants were deceived by local capitalists and land-owners, in which soldiers were deceived by the officers,etc. 
, etc. 
 Discontent, indignation and wrath are growing in the army, among the peasantry and among the workers. 
 The“coalition” of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks with the bourgeoisie, promising everything and fulfilling nothing, is irritating the masses, is opening their eyes, is pushing them towards insurrection. 
 There is a growing Left opposition among the Socialist-Revolutionaries (Spiridonova and others) and among theMensheviks (Martov and others), and has already reachedforty per cent of the Council and Congress of those parties. 
And down below , among the proletariat and the peasantry, particularly the poorest sections, the majority of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks belong to the Lefts . 
 The Kornilov revolt is instructive and has proved a good lesson. 
 It is impossible to know whether the Soviets will be able to go farther than the leaders of the Socialist-Revolution-aries and Mensheviks, and thus ensure a peaceful develop-ment of the revolution, or whether they will continue tomark time, thus making a proletarian uprising inevitable. 
 We cannot know this. 
Our business is to help get everything possible done to make sure the “last” chance for a peaceful development of the revolution, to help by the presentation of our programme, by making clear its national character, itsabsolute accord with the interests and demands of a vastmajority of the population. 
 The following lines are an essay in the presentation of such a programme. 
 Let us take it more to those down below, to the masses, to the office employees, to the workers, to the peasants,not only to our supporters, but particularly to those whofollow the Socialist-Revolutionaries, to the non-party ele-ments, to the ignorant. 
 Let us lift them up so that theycan pass an independent judgement, make their own deci-sions, send their own delegations to the Conference, to the Soviets, to the government and our work will not have beenin vain, no matter what the outcome of the Conference. 
 This will then prove useful for the Conference, for theelections to the Constituent Assembly, and for all otherpolitical activity in general. 
 Experience teaches us that the Bolshevik programme and tactics are correct. 
 So little time passed, so much happenedfrom April 20 to the Kornilov revolt. 
 The experience of the masses , the experience of op-pressed classes taught them very, very much in that time; the leaders of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks have completely cut adrift from the masses. 
 This willmost certainly be revealed in the discussion of our concreteprogramme insofar as we are able to bring it to the noticeof the masses. 
 AGREEMENTS WITH THE CAPITALISTS ARE DISASTROUS 1. 
 To leave in power the representatives of the bourgeoi-sie, even a small number of them, to leave in power suchnotorious Kornilovites as Generals Alexeyev, Klembovsky, Bagration, Gagarin, and others, or such as have proved their complete powerlessness in face of the bourgeoisie,and their ability of acting Bonaparte-fashion like Kerensky,is, on the one hand, merely opening the door wide to famineand the inevitable economic catastrophe which the capi-talists are purposely accelerating and intensifying; on the other hand, it will lead to a military catastrophe, since the army hates the General Staff and cannot enthusiasti-cally participate in the imperialist war. 
 Besides, there isno doubt that Kornilovite generals and officers remainingin power will deliberately open the front to the Germans , as they have done in Galicia and Riga. 
 This can be prevented only by the formation of a new government on a new basis, as expounded below. 
 To continue any kindof agreements with the bourgeoisie after all that we havegone through since April 20 would be, on the part of theSocialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, not only an errorbut a direct betrayal of the people and of the revolution. 
 POWER TO THE SOVIETS 2. 
 All power in the country must pass exclusively to the representatives of the Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’ andPeasants’ Deputies on the basis of a definite programmeand under the condition of the government being fully responsible to the Soviets. 
 New elections to the Soviets must be held immediately, both to record the experience of thepeople during the recent weeks of the revolution, which have been particularly eventful, and to eliminate crying injus-tices (lack of proportional representation, unequal elections, etc. 
) which in some cases still remain. 
 All power locally, wherever there are not yet any demo-cratically elected institutions, and also in the army, mustbe taken over exclusively by the local Soviets and by com-missars and other institutions elected by them, but onlythose that have been properly elected. 
 Workers and revolutionary troops, i. 
e. 
, those who have in practice shown their ability to suppress the Kornilovites,must everywhere be armed, and this must be done with thefull support of the state. 
 PEACE TO THE PEOPLES 3. 
 The Soviet Government must straight away offer to all the belligerent peoples (i. 
e. 
, simultaneously both totheir governments and to the worker and peasant masses)to conclude an immediate general peace on democraticterms, and also to conclude an immediate armistice (even if only for three months). 
 The main condition for a democratic peace is the renun-ciation of annexations (seizures)—not in the incorrect sensethat all powers get back what they have lost, but in theonly correct sense that every nationality without any exception, both in Europe and in the colonies, shall obtain its freedom and the possibility to decide for itself whether it is to form a separate state or whether it is to enter into the composition of some other state. 
 In offering the peace terms, the Soviet Government must itself immediately take steps towards their fulfilment, i. 
e. 
,it must publish and repudiate the secret treaties by which we have been bound up to the present time, those which were concluded by the tsar and which give Russian capi-talists the promise of the pillaging of Turkey, Austria,etc. 
 Then we must immediately satisfy the demands ofthe Ukrainians and the Finns, ensure them, as well as allother non-Russian nationalities in Russia, full freedom, including freedom of secession, applying the same to all Armenia, undertaking to evacuate that country as wellas the Turkish lands occupied by us, etc. 
 Such peace terms will not meet with the approval of the capitalists, but they will meet with such tremendous sym-pathy on the part of all the peoples and will cause such a great world-wide outburst of enthusiasm and of generalindignation against the continuation of the predatory warthat it is extremely probable that we shall at once obtaina truce and a consent to open peace negotiations. 
 For theworkers’ revolution against the war is irresistibly growing everywhere, and it can be spurred on, not by phrases about peace (with which the workers and peasants have been de-ceived by all the imperialist governments including our own Kerensky government), but by a break with the capitalistsand by the offer of peace. 
 If the least probable thing happens, i. 
e. 
, if not a single belligerent state accepts even a truce, then as far as we are concerned the war becomes truly forced upon us, it becomesa truly just war of defence. 
 If this is understood by theproletariat and the poor peasantry Russia will becomemany times stronger even in the military sense, especiallyafter a complete break with the capitalists who are robbing the people; furthermore, under such conditions it would, as far as we are concerned, be a war in league with theoppressed classes of all countries, a war in league with theoppressed peoples of the whole world, not in word, but indeed. 
 The people must be particularly cautioned against the capitalists’ assertion which sometimes influences the petty bourgeoisie and others who are frightened, namely, thatthe British and other capitalists are capable of doingserious damage to the Russian revolution if we break thepresent predatory alliance with them. 
 Such an assertionis false through and through, for “Allied financial aid” enriches the bankers and “supports” the Russian workers and peasants in exactly the same way as a rope supportsa man who has been hanged. 
 There is plenty of bread, coal,oil and iron in Russia; for these products to be properlydistributed it is only necessary for us to rid ourselves ofthe landowners and capitalists who are robbing the people. 
 As to the possibility of the Russian people being threatened with war by their present Allies, it is obviously absurd toassume that the French and Italians could unite their armies with those of the Germans and move them against Russia who offers a just peace. 
 As to Britain, America, and Japan, even if they were to declare war against Russia (which for them is extremely difficult, both because of theextreme unpopularity of such a war among the masses andbecause of the divergence of material interests of the capi-talists of those countries over the partitioning of Asia,especially over the plunder of China), they could not cause Russia one-hundredth part of the damage and misery which the war with Germany, Austria, and Turkey is causing her. 
 LAND TO THOSE WHO TILL IT 4. 
 The Soviet Government must immediately declare the abolition of private landed estates without compen-sation and place all these estates under the management ofthe peasant committees pending the solution of the problemby the Constituent Assembly. 
 These peasant committeesare also to take over all the landowners’ stock and imple-ments, with the proviso that they be placed primarily at the disposal of the poor peasants for their use free of charge. 
 Such measures, which have long been demanded by an immense majority of the peasantry, both in the resolutionsof congresses and in hundreds of mandates from local peas-ants (as may be seen, for instance, from a summary of242 mandates published by Izvestia Soveta Krestyanskikh Deputatov38), are absolutely and urgently necessary. 
 There must be no further procrastination like that from whichthe peasantry suffered so much at the time of the “coalition”government. 
 Any government that hesitates to introduce these measures should be regarded as a government hostile to the people that should be overthrown and crushed by an uprising of the workers and peasants. 
 On the other hand, only a governent that realises these measures will be a government ofall the people. 
 STRUGGLE AGAINST FAMINE AND ECONOMIC RUIN 5. 
 The Soviet Government must immediately introduce workers’ control of production and distribution on anation-wide scale. 
 Experience since May 6 has shown that in the absence of such control all the promises of reforms and attempts to introduce them are powerless, and famine, accompanied by unprecedented catastrophe is becoming a greater menace to the whole country week by week. 
 It is necessary to nationalise the banks and the insur-ance business immediately, and also the most importantbranches of industry (oil, coal, metallurgy, sugar, etc. 
),and at the same time, to abolish commercial secrets and to establish unrelaxing supervision by the workers and peas-ants over the negligible minority of capitalists who waxrich on government contracts and evade accounting andjust taxation of their profits and property. 
 Such measures, which do not deprive either the middle peasants, the Cossacks or the small handicraftsmen of a single kopek, are urgently needed for the struggle against famine and are absolutely just because they distribute theburdens of the war equitably. 
 Only after capitalist plunderhas been curbed and the deliberate sabotage of productionhas been stopped will it be possible to work for an improve-ment in labour productivity, introduce universal labour conscription and the proper exchange of grain for manufac-tured goods, and return to the Treasury thousands of mil-lions in paper money now being hoarded by the rich. 
 Without such measures, the abolition of the landed estates without compensation is also impossible, for themajor part of the estates is mortgaged to the banks, so that the interests of the landowners and capitalists are inseparably linked up. 
 The latest resolution of the Economic Department of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee of Soviets ofWorkers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies ( Rabochaya Gazeta No. 
 152) recognises not only the “ harm ” caused by the government’s measures (like the raising of grain prices for the enrichment of the landowners and kulaks), not only “the fact of thecomplete inactivity on the part of the central organs set up by the government for the regulation of economic life”,but even the “ contravention of the laws ” by this government. 
 This admission on the part of the ruling parties, the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, proves once more the criminal nature of the policy of conciliation with thebourgeoisie. 
 STRUGGLE AGAINST THE COUNTER -REVOLUTION OF THE LANDOWNERS AND CAPITALISTS 6. 
 The Kornilov and Kaledin revolt was supported by the entire class of the landowners and capitalists, with theparty of the Cadets (“people’s freedom” party) at their head. 
 This has already been fully proved by the facts pub-lished in Izvestia of the Central Executive Committee. 
 However, nothing has been done either to suppress this counter-revolution completely or even to investigate it,and nothing serious can be done without the transfer ofpower to the Soviets. 
 No commission can conduct a full investigation, or arrest the guilty, etc. 
, unless it holds state power. 
 Only a Soviet government can do this, andmust do it. 
 Only a Soviet government can make Russiasecure against the otherwise inevitable repetition of “Kor-nilov” attempts by arresting the Kornilovite generalsand the ringleaders of the bourgeois counter-revolution (Guchkov, Milyukov, Ryabushinsky, Maklakov and Co. 
), by disbanding the counter-revolutionary associations (theState Duma, the officers’ unions, etc. 
), by placing theirmembers under the surveillance of the local Soviets andby disbanding counter-revolutionary armed units. 
 This government alone can set up a commission to make a full and public investigation of the Kornilov case and all the other cases, even those started by the bourgeoisie;and the party of the Bolsheviks, in its turn, would appealto the workers to give full co-operation and to submit onlyto such a commission. 
 Only a Soviet government could successfully combat such a flagrant injustice as the capitalists’ seizure of the largest printing presses and most of the papers with theaid of millions squeezed out of the people. 
 It is necessaryto suppress the bourgeois counter-revolutionary papers(Rech , Russkoye Slovo ,39 etc. 
), to confiscate their printing presses, to declare private advertisements in the papers a state monopoly, to transfer them to the paper published by the Soviets, the paper that tells the peasants the truth. 
Only in this way can and must the bourgeoisie be deprivedof its powerful weapon of lying and slandering, deceivingthe people with impunity, misleading the peasantry, andpreparing a counter-revolution. 
 PEACEFUL DEVELOPMENT OF THE REVOLUTION 7. 
 A possibility very seldom to be met with in the history of revolutions now faces the democracy of Russia, theSoviets and the Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik parties—the possibility of convening the Constituent Assembly at the appointed date without further delays, ofmaking the country secure against a military and economiccatastrophe, and of ensuring the peaceful development ofthe revolution. 
 If the Soviets now take full state power exclusively into their own hands for the purpose of carrying out the pro-gramme set forth above, they will not only obtain thesupport of nine-tenths of the population of Russia, theworking class and an overwhelming majority of the peas-antry; they will also be assured of the greatest revolutionaryenthusiasm on the part of the army and the majority of the people, an enthusiasm without which victory over famine and war is impossible. 
 There could be no question of any resistance to the Soviets if the Soviets themselves did not waver. 
 No classwill dare start an uprising against the Soviets, and thelandowners and capitalists, taught a lesson by the experience of the Kornilov revolt, will give up their power peacefully and yield to the ultimatum of the Soviets. 
 Toovercome the capitalists’ resistance to the programme ofthe Soviets, supervision over the exploiters by workers andpeasants and such measures of punishing the recalcitrantsas confiscation of their entire property coupled with a short term of arrest will be sufficient. 
 By seizing full power, the Soviets could still today—and this is probably their last chance—ensure the peacefuldevelopment of the revolution, peaceful elections of deputiesby the people, and a peaceful struggle of parties insidethe Soviets; they could test the programmes of the various parties in practice and power could pass peacefully from one party to another. 
 The entire course of development of the revolution, from the movement of April 20 to the Kornilov revolt, showsthat there is bound to be the bitterest civil war betweenthe bourgeoisie and the proletariat if this opportunity is missed. 
 Inevitable catastrophe will bring this war nearer. 
 It must end, as all data and considerations accessible to human reason go to prove, in the full victory of the working class, in that class, supported by the poor peasantry, carry-ing out the above programme; it may, however, prove verydifficult and bloody, and may cost the lives of tens of thou-sands of landowners, capitalists, and officers who sympathisewith them. 
 The proletariat will not hesitate to make every sacrifice to save the revolution, which is possible only by implementing the programme set forth above. 
 On theother hand, the proletariat would support the Soviets inevery way if they were to make use of their last chance tosecure a peaceful development of the revolution.

 LETTER TO I. 
 T. 
 SMILGA, CHAIRMAN OF THE REGIONAL COMMITTEE OF THE ARMY, NAVY AND WORKERS OF FINLAND Comrade Smilga, I am taking advantage of a favourable opportunity to talk with you in greater detail. 
 1 The general political situation causes me great anxiety. 
 The Petrograd Soviet and the Bolsheviks have declaredwar on the government. 
 But the government has an army,and is preparing systematically . 
 (Kerensky at General Headquarters is obviously entering into an understanding—a business-like understanding with the Kornilovites to use troops to put down the Bolsheviks. 
) And what are we doing? We are only passing resolutions. 
 We are losing time. 
 We set “dates” (October 20, the Congressof Soviets—is it not ridiculous to put it off so long? Is itnot ridiculous to rely on that?). 
 The Bolsheviks are not conducting regular work to prepare their own military forces for the overthrow of Kerensky. 
 Events have fully proved the correctness of the proposal I made at the time of the Democratic Conference, namely,that the Party must put the armed uprising on the order of the day. 
 * Events compel us to do this. 
 History has made the military question now the fundamental political ques-tion. 
 I am afraid that the Bolsheviks forget this, being busy *See pp. 
 19-21 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 with “day-to-day events”, petty current questions, and “hoping ” that “the wave will sweep Kerensky away”. 
 Such hope is naïve; it is the same as relying on chance, and may prove criminal on the part of the party of the revolutionaryproletariat. 
 It is my opinion that inside the Party we must agitate for an earnest attitude towards the armed uprising, forwhich reason this letter should be typed and delivered to the Petrograd and Moscow comrades. 
 2 Now about your role. 
 It seems to me we can have com-pletely at our disposal only the troops in Finland and the Baltic fleet and only they can play a serious military role. 
 I think you must make most of your high position, shiftall the petty routine work to assistants and secretaries andnot waste time on “resolutions”; give all your attention to the military preparation of the troops in Finland plus the fleet for the impending overthrow of Kerensky. 
 Create a secret committee of absolutely trustworthy military men, discuss matters thoroughly with them, collect (and per-sonally verify) the most precise data on the composition and the location of troops near and in Petrograd, the transferof the troops from Finland to Petrograd, the movement of the fleet, etc. 
 If we fail to do this, we may turn out to be consummate idiots, the owners of beautiful resolutions and of Soviets,but no power ! I think it is possible for you to select really reliable and competent military men, to make a trip toIno 40 and other most important points, to weigh and study the matter earnestly , not relying on the boastful general phrases all too common with us. 
 It is obvious that we can under no circumstances allow the troops to be moved from Finland. 
 Better do anything , better decide on an uprising, on the seizure of power, laterto be transferred to the Congress of Soviets. 
 I read in the papers today that in two weeks the danger of a landing will be nil. 
 Obviously, you have very little time left for pre-paration. 
 3 To continue. 
 We must utilise our “power” in Finland to conduct systematic propaganda among the Cossacks nowstationed in Finland. 
 From Vyborg, for instance, Kerenskyand Co. 
 purposely removed some of them, fearing Bolshe-visation”, and stationed them in Uusikirkko and Perkjärvi, between Vyborg and Terijoki, in Bolshevik-proof isolation. 
 We must study all the information about the location ofthe Cossacks, and must organise the dispatch of propaganda groups to them from among the best forces of the sailors and soldiers in Finland. 
 This is imperative. 
 Do the samething about literature. 
 4 To continue. 
 Of course, both sailors and soldiers go home on furloughs. 
 Out of these men we must form groups of propagandists to travel over the provinces systematically and to carry on both general propaganda and propaganda infavour of the Constituent Assembly in the villages. 
 Yoursituation is exceptionally good because you are in a posi-tion to begin immediately to form that bloc with the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries which alone can give us stable power in Russia and a majority in the Constituent Assembly. 
 While things are being settled, organise such a bloc imme-diately in your place, organise the publication of leaflets(find out what you can do about them technically as wellas in the matter of transporting them into Russia). 
 Theneach propaganda group for work in the rural areas should consist of not less than two persons—one from the Bolshe-viks and one from the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
 TheSocialist-Revolutionary “trade mark” is still popular amongvillage folk and you must make the most of your goodfortune (you have some Left Socialist-Revolutionaries)to effect a bloc of the Bolsheviks and Left Socialist-Revo-lutionaries under this “trade mark” in the countryside, a bloc of peasants and workers and not of peasants andcapitalists. 
 5 It seems to me that in order to prepare people’s minds properly we must immediately circulate the followingslogan: transfer power now to the Petrograd Soviet which will transfer it to the Congress of Soviets. 
 Why should we tolerate three more weeks of war and Kerensky’s “Korni-lovite preparations”? Propaganda in favour of this slogan by the Bolsheviks and Left Socialist-Revolutionaries in Finland can do noth-ing but good. 
 6 Since you are vested with “power” in Finland, you have to do one more very important, though in itself modestjob—organise the illegal transport of literature from Sweden. 
 Without this all talk of an “International” is an empty phrase . 
 This can be done, first, by creating our own organisation of soldiers at the frontier; secondly, if this is impossible, by organising regular trips of at least one reliable man to a certain place where I began to organise the trans-port with the aid of the person in whose house I lived for one day before moving to Helsingfors (Rovio knows him). 
 41 Perhaps we must help with some money. 
 Get this done by all means! 7 I think we should meet to talk all these things over. 
 You could come here; it would take you less than a day;if you come only to see me, have Rovio phone Huttunen and ask him whether Rovio’s “sister-in-law” (meaning you) maysee Huttunen’s “sister” (meaning myself). 
 I may have to leave suddenly. 
 Do not fail to acknowledge the receipt of this letter ( burn it) through the comrade who will bring it to Rovio and who will soon go back. 
 In case I stay here longer, we must organise postal con-nections. 
 You could help by sending envelopes through railway workers to the Vyborg Soviet (inside envelope: “for Huttunen”). 
 8 Send me by the same comrade identification papers (as formal as possible, either typewritten, or in very clear handwriting on the stationery of the Regional Committee, stamped and with the signature of the chairman), in thename of Konstantin Petrovich Ivanov, to the effect thatthe chairman of the Regional Committee vouches for comrade so-and-so, and requests all Soviets , the Vyborg Soviet of Soldiers’ Deputies as well as others, to give him full con-fidence, aid and support. 
 I need it in case of some emergency, since a “conflict” and a “meeting” are equally possible. 
 9 Have you a copy of the Moscow collection of articles On the Revision of the Programme ?42 Try to find one among the comrades in Helsingfors and send it to me by the samecomrade. 
 10 Bear in mind that Rovio is a fine fellow, but lazy . 
 He must be looked after and reminded of things twice a day. 
 Otherwise he won’t do them. 
 Greetings.

 Ivanov Written on September 27 (October 10), 1917 First published in Pravda Published according No. 
 255, November 7, 1925 to the manuscript THE CRISI S HAS MATURE D43 I The end of September undoubtedly marked a great turn-ing-point in the history of the Russian revolution and, to all appearances, of the world revolution as well. 
 The world working-class revolution began with the action of individuals, whose boundless courage representedeverything honest that remained of that decayed official “socialism” which is in reality social-chauvinism. 
 Liebknecht in Germany, Adler in Austria, MacLean in Britain—theseare the best-known names of the isolated heroes who havetaken upon themselves the arduous role of forerunners ofthe world revolution. 
 The second stage in the historical preparation for this revolution was a widespread mass discontent, expressingitself in the split of the official parties, in illegal publica-tions and in street demonstrations. 
 The protest against thewar became stronger, and the number of victims of govern-ment persecution increased. 
 The prisons of countries famedfor their observance of law and even for their freedom—Ger-many, France, Italy and Britain—became filled with tens and hundreds of internationalists, opponents of the warand advocates of a working-class revolution. 
 The third stage has now begun. 
 This stage may be called the eve of revolution. 
 Mass arrests of party leaders in freeItaly, and particularly the beginning of mutinies in the German army, 44 are indisputable symptoms that a great turning-point is at hand, that we are on the eve of a world-wide revolution .

 30, October 20 (7), 1917, in which Lenin’s article “The Crisis Has Matured” was pub-lished Reduced Even before this there were, no doubt, individual cases of mutiny among the troops in Germany, but they were so small, so weak and isolated that it was possible to hush them up—and that was the chief way of checking the mass contagion of seditious action. 
 Finally, there developed such a movement in the navy that it was impossible to hush it up, despite all the severity of the German regime of mili-tary servitude, severity elaborated with amazing minuteness of detail and observed with incredible pedantry. 
 Doubt is out of the question. 
 We are on the threshold of a world proletarian revolution. 
 And since of all the pro-letarian internationalists in all countries only we RussianBolsheviks enjoy a measure of freedom—we have a legalparty and a score or so of papers, we have the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies of both capitals on our side, and we have the support of a majority of the people in a time of revolution—to us the saying, “To whom muchhas been given, of him much shall be required” in alljustice can and must be applied. 
 II The crucial point of the revolution in Russia has un-doubtedly arrived. 
 In a peasant country, and under a revolutionary, repub-lican government which enjoys the support of the Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik parties that only yesterday dominated petty-bourgeois democracy, a peasant revolt is developing. 
 Incredible as this is, it is a fact. 
We Bolsheviks are not surprised by this fact. 
 We have always said that the government of the notorious “coalition” with the bourgeoisie is a government that betrays democracy and the revolution, that it is a government of imperialist slaughter, a government that protects the capitalists and landowners from the people. 
 Owing to the deception practised by the Socialist-Revo-lutionaries and the Mensheviks, there still exists in Russia, under a republic and in a time of revolution, a government of capitalists and landowners side by side with the Soviets. 
This is the bitter and sinister reality. 
 Is it then surprising, in view of the incredible hardship inflicted on the people by prolonging the imperialist war and by its consequences, that a peasant revolt has begun and is spreading in Russia? Is it then surprising that the enemies of the Bolsheviks, the leaders of the official Socialist-Revolutionary Party, the very party that supported the “coalition” all along, theparty that until the last few days or weeks had the majority of the people on its side, the party that continues to harry and abuse the “new” Socialist-Revolutionaries, who haverealised that the policy of coalition is a betrayal of theinterests of the peasants—is it surprising that these leadersof the official Socialist-Revolutionary Party wrote thefollowing in an editorial in their official organ, Dyelo Naroda of September 29: “So far practically nothing has been done to put an end to the relations of bondage that still prevail in the villages of central Rus-sia.... 
 The bill for the regulation of land relations in the countryside, which was introduced in the Provisional Government long ago, andwhich has even passed through such a purgatory as the Judicial Con-ference, has got hopelessly stuck in some office .... 
 Are we not right in asserting that our republican government is still a long way fromhaving rid itself of the old habits of the tsarist administration, andthat the dead hand of Stolypin is still making itself strongly felt inthe methods of the revolutionary ministers?” This is written by the official Socialist-Revolutionaries! Just think: the supporters of the coalition are forced to ad-mit that in a peasant country, after seven months of revolu-tion, “practically nothing has been done to put an end to thebondage” of the peasants, to their enslavement by the land-owners! These Socialist-Revolutionaries are forced to give the name of Stolypins to their colleague, Kerensky, and his gang of ministers. 
 Could we get more eloquent testimony than this from the camp of our opponents, not only to the effect that the coa-lition has collapsed and that the official Socialist-Revolu-tionaries who tolerate Kerensky have become an anti-popular , anti-peasant and counter-revolutionary party , but also that the whole Russian revolution has reached a turning-point? A peasant revolt in a peasant country against the govern-ment of the Socialist-Revolutionary Kerensky, the Men-sheviks Nikitin and Gvozdyov, and other ministers who rep-resent capital and the interests of the landowners! The crushing of this revolt by military measures by a repub-lican government! In the face of such facts, can one remain a conscientious champion of the proletariat and yet deny that a crisis hasmatured, that the revolution is passing through an extreme-ly critical moment, that the government’s victory over the peasant revolt would now sound the death knell of therevolution, would be the final triumph of the Kornilovrevolt? III It is obvious that if in a peasant country, after seven months of a democratic republic, matters could come toa peasant revolt, it irrefutably proves that the revolutionis suffering nation-wide collapse, that it is experiencing acrisis of unprecedented severity, and that the forces ofcounter-revolution have gone the limit . 
 That is obvious. 
 In the face of such a fact as a peasant revolt all other political symptoms, even were they to contra-dict the fact that a nation-wide crisis is maturing, wouldhave no significance whatsoever. 
 But on the contrary, all the symptoms do indicate that a nation-wide crisis has matured. 
 Next to the agrarian question, the most important ques-tion in Russia’s state affairs is the national question, partic-ularly for the petty-bourgeois masses of the population. 
And at the “Democratic” Conference, which was fixed byMr. 
 Tsereteli and Co. 
, we find that the “national” curia takessecond place for radicalism, yielding only to the trade unions, and exceeding the curia of the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies in the percentage of votes cast against the coalition (40 out of 55). 
 The Kerensky government—agovernment suppressing the peasant revolt—is withdraw-ing the revolutionary troops from Finland in order tostrengthen the reactionary Finnish bourgeoisie. 
 In the Ukraine, the conflicts of the Ukrainians in general, and of the Ukrainian troops in particular, with the governmentare becoming more and more frequent. 
 Furthermore, let us take the army, which in war-time plays an exceptionally big role in all state affairs. 
 We find that the army in Finland and the fleet in the Baltic have completely parted ways with the government. 
 We have the testimony of the officer Dubasov, a non-Bolshevik, whospeaks in the name of the whole front and declares in amanner more revolutionary than that of any Bolsheviks thatthe soldiers will not fight any longer. 
 45 We have govern-mental reports stating that the soldiers are in a state of “agitation” and that it is impossible to guarantee the main-tenance of “order” (i. 
e. 
, participation of these troops in thesuppression of the peasant revolt). 
 We have, finally, thevoting in Moscow, where fourteen thousand out of seventeenthousand soldiers voted for the Bolsheviks. 
 This vote in the elections to the district councils in Mos-cow is in general one of the most striking symptoms of theprofound change which has taken place in the mood of thewhole nation. 
 It is generally known that Moscow is morepetty-bourgeois than Petrograd. 
 It is a fact frequently cor-roborated and indisputable that the Moscow proletariat has an incomparably greater number of connections with the countryside, that it has greater sympathy forthe peasant and is closer to the sentiments of thepeasant. 
 In Moscow the vote cast for the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Mensheviks nevertheless dropped from 70 per cent in June to 18 per cent. 
 There can be no doubt that the petty bourgeoisie and the people have turned away from thecoalition. 
 The Cadets have increased their strength from 17to 30 per cent, but they remain a minority, a hopeless minor-ity, despite the fact that they have obviously been joinedby the “Right” Socialist-Revolutionaries, and the “Right” Mensheviks. 
 Russkiye Vedomosti 46 states that the absolute number of votes cast for the Cadets fell from 67,000 to 62,000. 
 Only the votes cast for the Bolsheviks increased—from34,000 to 82,000. 
 They received 47 per cent of the totalvote. 
 There can be no shadow of doubt that we, together withthe Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, now have a majority in the Soviets, in the army, and in the country . 
 Among the symptoms that have not only a symptomatic, but also a very real significance is the fact that the armies of railway and postal employees, who are of immense impor-tance from the general economic, political and military point of view, continue to be in sharp conflict with the government,47 even the Menshevik defencists are dissatisfied with “their” Minister, Nikitin, and the official Socialist-Revolutionaries call Kerensky and Co. 
 “Stolypins”. 
 Is itnot clear that if such “support” of the government by theMensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries has any value at all it can be only a negative value? IV . 
 ......................

 V Yes, the leaders of the Central Executive Committee are pursuing the correct tactics of defending the bourgeoisieand the landowners. 
 And there is not the slightest doubtthat if the Bolsheviks allowed themselves to be caught in the trap of constitutional illusions, “faith” in the Congress of Soviets and in the convocation of the Constituent Assem-bly, “waiting” for the Congress of Soviets, and so forth—these Bolsheviks would most certainly be miserable trai-tors to the proletarian cause. 
 They would be traitors to the cause, for by their conduct they would be betraying the German revolutionary workers who have started a revolt in the navy. 
 To “wait” for theCongress of Soviets and so forth under such circumstanceswould be a betrayal of internationalism , a betrayal of the cause of the world socialist revolution. 
 For internationalism consists of deeds and not phrases, not expressions of solidarity, not resolutions. 
 The Bolsheviks would be traitors to the peasants , for to tolerate the suppression of the peasant revolt by a govern-ment which even Dyelo Naroda compares with the Stoly-pin government would be to ruin the whole revolution, to ruin it for good. 
 An outcry is raised about anarchy and about the increasing indifference of the people, but what else can the people be but indifferent to the elections, when thepeasants have been driven to revolt while the so-called “revolutionary democrats” are patiently tolerating its sup-pression by military force! The Bolsheviks would be traitors to democracy and to freedom, for to tolerate the suppression of the peasantrevolt at such a moment would mean allowing the elections to the Constituent Assembly to be fixed in exactly the same way as the Democratic Conference and the “Pre-parliament” were fixed, only even worse and more crudely. 
 The crisis has matured. 
 The whole future of the Russian revolution is at stake. 
 The honour of the Bolshevik Partyis in question. 
 The whole future of the international workers’revolution for socialism is at stake. 
 The crisis has matured.... 
 September 29, 1917. 
 Everything to this point may be published, but what follows is to be distributed among the members of the Cen-tral Committee , the Petrograd Committee , the Moscow Commit-tee, and the Soviets. 
 VI What, then, is to be done? We must aussprechen was ist , “state the facts”, admit the truth that there is a tendency,or an opinion, in our Central Committee and among the leaders of our Party which favours waiting for the Congress of Soviets, and is opposed to taking power immediately, is opposed to an immediate insurrection. 
 That tendency, or opinion, must be overcome . 
 48 Otherwise, the Bolsheviks will cover themselves with eternal shame and destroy themselves as a party. 
 For to miss such a moment and to “wait” for the Congress of Soviets would be utter idiocy , or sheer treachery . 
 It would be sheer treachery to the German workers. 
 Surely we should not wait until their revolution begins . 
 In that case even the Lieberdans would be in favour of“supporting” it. 
 But it cannot begin as long as Kerensky, Kishkin and Co. 
 are in power. 
 It would be sheer treachery to the peasants. 
 To allow the peasant revolt to be suppressed when we control the Soviets of both capitals would be to lose , and justly lose , every ounce of the peasants’ confidence. 
 In the eyes of the peasants we would be putting ourselves on a level with the Lieberdans and other scoundrels. 
 To “wait” for the Congress of Soviets would be utter idiocy, for it would mean losing weeks at a time when weeks and even days decide everything . 
 It would mean faint-heartedly renouncing power, for on November 1 -2 it will have become impossible to take power (both politically and technically, since the Cossacks would be mobilised for the day of theinsurrection so foolishly “appointed” *). 
 To “wait” for the Congress of Soviets is idiocy, for the Congress will give nothing , and can give nothing ! “Moral” importance? Strange indeed, to talk of the “importance” of resolutions and conversations with the Lieberdans when we know that the Soviets support the peasants and that the peasant revolt is being suppressed ! We would be reducing the Soviets to the status of wretched debating parlours. 
 First defeat Kerensky, then call theCongress. 
 The Bolsheviks are now guaranteed the success of the insurrection: (1) we can ** (if we do not “wait” for the Soviet Congress) launch a surprise attack from three points— from Petrograd, from Moscow and from the Baltic fleet;(2) we have slogans that guarantee us support—down withthe government that is suppressing the revolt of the peas-ants against the landowners! (3) we have a majority in the country ; (4) the disorganisation among the Mensheviks and the Socialist-Revolutionaries is complete; (5) weare technically in a position to take power in Moscow (wherethe start might even be made, so as to catch the enemyunawares); (6) we have thousands of armed workers and soldiers in Petrograd who could at once seize the Winter Palace, the General Staff building, the telephone exchange *To “convene” the Congress of Soviets for October 20 in order to decide upon “taking power”—how does that differ from foolishly“appointing ” an insurrection? It is possible to take power now, whereas on October 20-29 you will not be given a chance to. 
 **What has the Party done to study the disposition of the troops, etc? What has it done to conduct the insurrection as an art? Mere talk in the Central Executive Committee, and so on! and the large printing presses. 
 Nothing will be able to drive us out, while agitational work in the army will be such as to make it impossible to combat this government of peace, of land for the peasants, and so forth. 
 If we were to attack at once, suddenly, from three points, Petrograd, Moscow and the Baltic fleet, the chances area hundred to one that we would succeed with smaller sacri-fices than on July 3-5, because the troops will not advance against a government of peace. 
 Even though Kerensky already has “loyal” cavalry, etc. 
, in Petrograd, if we were to attack from two sides, he would be compelled to surrender since we enjoy the sympathy of the army. 
 If with such chances as we have at present we do not take power, thenall talk of transferring the power to the Soviets becomes a lie . 
 To refrain from taking power now, to “wait”, to indulge in talk in the Central Executive Committee, to con-fine ourselves to “fighting for the organ” (of the Soviet),“fighting for the Congress”, is to doom the revolution to failure . 
 In view of the fact that the Central Committee has even left unanswered the persistent demands I have been making for such a policy ever since the beginning of the DemocraticConference, in view of the fact that the Central Organ isdeleting from my articles all references to such glaring errors on the part of the Bolsheviks as the shameful decision to participate in the Pre-parliament, the admission of Men-sheviks to the Presidium of the Soviet, etc. 
, etc. 
—I am com-pelled to regard this as a “subtle” hint at the unwillingnessof the Central Committee even to consider this question, asubtle hint that I should keep my mouth shut, and as a pro-posal for me to retire. 
 I am compelled to tender my resignation from the Central Committee , which I hereby do, reserving for myself free-dom to campaign among the rank and file of the Party and at the Party Congress. 
 For it is my profound conviction that if we “wait” for the Congress of Soviets and let the present moment pass, we shall ruin the revolution.

 1-2 the magazine text FOREWORD TO THE SECOND EDITION The present pamphlet, as is evident from the text, was written at the end of September and was finished on October 1, 1917. 
 The October 25 Revolution has transferred the question raised in this pamphlet from the sphere of theory to thesphere of practice. 
 This question must now be answered by deeds, not words. 
 The theoretical arguments advanced against the Bolsheviks taking power were feeble in the extreme. 
 These arguments have been shot to pieces. 
 The task now is for the advanced class—the proletariat— to prove in practice the viability of the workers’ and peasants’ government. 
 All class-conscious workers, all the ac-tive and honest peasants, all working and exploited people, will do everything they can to solve the immense historic question in practice. 
 To work, everybody to work, the cause of the world social-ist revolution must and will triumph. 
 St. 
 Petersburg, November 9, 1917. 
 N. 
 Lenin First published in 1918 Published according in the pamphlet by N. 
 Lenin, to the pamphlet Can the Bolsheviks Retain State Power? , “Soldiers’ and Peasants’ Library” Series, St. 
 Petersburg On what are all trends agreed, from Rech to Novaya Zhizn50 inclusively, from the Kornilovite Cadets to the semi-Bolsheviks, all, except the Bolsheviks? They all agree that the Bolsheviks will either never dare take over full state power alone, or, if they do dare, anddo take power, they will not be able to retain it even forthe shortest while. 
 If anybody asserts that the question of the Bolsheviks alone taking over full state power is a totally unfeasible political question, that only a swelled-headed “fanatic”of the worst kind can regard it as feasible, we refute thisassertion by quoting the exact statements of the most re-sponsible and most influential political parties and trendsof various “hues”. 
 But let me begin with a word or two about the first of the questions mentioned—will the Bolsheviks dare takeover full state power alone? I have already had occasion,at the All-Russia Congress of Soviets, to answer this ques-tion in the affirmative in no uncertain manner by a remark that I shouted from my seat during one of Tsereteli’s 51 ministerial speeches. 
 And I have not met in the press, or heard, any statements by Bolsheviks to the effect that weought not to take power alone. 
 I still maintain that a political party—and the party of the advanced class in particular—would have no right to exist, would be unworthyof the name of party, would be a nonentity in any sense, if it refused to take power when opportunity offers. 
 We shall now quote statements by the Cadets, Socialist-Revolutionaries and semi-Bolsheviks (I would prefer to say quarter-Bolsheviks) on the question that in-terests us. 
 The leading article in Rech of September 16: “Discord and confusion reigned in the Alexandrinsky Theatre, and the socialist press reflects the same picture. 
 Only the views of the Bolsheviks are definite and straightforward At the Conference, theyare the views of the minority. 
 In the Soviets, they represent a constant-ly growing trend. 
 But In spite of all their verbal pugnacity, their boastful phrases and display of self-confidence, the Bolsheviks, exceptfor a few fanatics, are brave only in words. 
 They would not attempt to take ‘full power’ on their own accord. 
 Disorganisers and disrupters par excellence , they are really cowards who in their heart of hearts are fully aware of both their own intrinsic ignorance and the ephem-eral nature of their present successes. 
 They know as well as we all do that the first day of their ultimate triumph would also be the firstday of their precipitous fall. 
 Irresponsible by their very nature, anar-chists in method and practice, they should be regarded only as a trend of political thought, or rather, as one of its aberrations. 
 The best wayto get rid of Bolshevism for many a year, to banish it, would be to place the country’s fate in the hands of its leaders. 
 And if it were not for the awareness that experiments of this kind are impermissibleand fatal, one might in desperation decide on even this heroic measure. 
 Happily, we repeat, these dismal heroes of the day are not by any means actually out to seize full power. 
 Not under any circumstancesare they capable of constructive work. 
 Thus, all their definite and straight-forward views are confined to the political rostrum, to soap-box oratory. 
 For practical purposes their position cannot be takeninto consideration from any point of view. 
 In one respect, however, it has some practical consequence: it unites all other shades of ‘social-ist thought’ opposed to it.... 
” This is the way the Cadets reason. 
 Here, however, is the view of the biggest, “ruling and governing”, party in Russia, the Socialist-Revolutionaries, also expressed in an unsigned, i. 
e. 
, editorial, leading article in their officialorgan Dyelo Naroda of September 21: ...“If the bourgeoisie refuse, pending the convocation of the Constit-uent Assembly, to work with the democracy on the basis of the plat-form that was endorsed by the Conference, then the coalition must arise from within the Conference itself . 
 This would be a serious sacrifice on the part of the supporters of the coalition, but even those campaigning for the idea of a ‘pure line ’ of power will have to agree to it . 
 We are afraid, however, that agreement may not be reached here. 
 In that case a thirdand final combination remains, namely: the government must be organised by that half of the Conference which on principle advocated the idea of a homogeneous government. 
 “Let us put it definitely: the Bolsheviks will be obliged to form a Cab-inet . 
 With the greatest energy, they imbued the revolutionary demo-crats with hatred of the coalition, promising them all sorts of benefits as soon as ‘compromise’ was abandoned, and attributing to the latterall the country’s misfortunes. 
 “If they were aware of what they were doing by their agitation , if they were not deceiving the people , it is their duty to redeem the promissory notes they have been handing out right and left. 
 “The question is clear. 
“Let them not make futile attempts to hide behind hastily concoct-ed theory that it is impossible for them to take power. 
 “The democracy will not accept these theories. 
 “At the same time, the advocates of coalition must guarantee them full support. 
 These are the three combinations, the three ways, opento us—there are no others!” (The italics are those of Dyelo Naroda . 
) This is the way the Socialist-Revolutionaries reason. 
 And here, finally, is the “position” (if attempts to sit between two stools can be called a position) of the Novaya Zhizn “quarter-Bolsheviks”, taken from the editorial in Novaya Zhizn of September 23. 
 “If a coalition with Konovalov and Kishkin is formed again, it will mean nothing but a new capitulation by the democracy and theabrogation of the Conference resolution on the formation of a respon-sible government on the platform of August 14.... 
 “A homogeneous ministry of Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolution-aries will be able to feel its responsibility as little as the responsible socialist ministers felt it in the coalition cabinet .... 
 This government would not only be incapable of rallying the ‘live forces’ of the revo-lution around itself, but would not even be able to count on any activesupport from its vanguard—the proletariat. 
 “But the formation of another type of homogeneous cabinet, a government of the ‘proletariat and poor peasants’, would be, not a better, but an even worse way out of the situation, in fact it wouldnot be a way out at all, but sheer bankruptcy. 
 True, nobody is advanc-ing such a slogan except in casual, timid and later systematically‘explained away’ comments in Rabochy Put . 
” (This glaring untruth is “boldly” written by responsible journalists who have forgotten even the Dyelo Naroda editorial of September 21. 
) “Formally, the Bolsheviks have now revived the slogan ‘All Power to the Soviets’. 
 It was withdrawn after the July days, when the Soviets, represented by the Central Executive Committee, definitely adopted an active anti-Bolshevik policy. 
 Now, however, not onlycan the ‘Soviet line’ be regarded as straightened out, but there is every ground to assume that at the proposed Congress of Soviets the Bolsheviks will have a majority. 
 Under such circumstances the slo-gan ‘All Power to the Soviets’, resurrected by the Bolsheviks, is a ‘tactical line’ for achieving precisely the dictatorship of the prole-tariat and the ‘poor peasants’ True, the Soviets also imply the Soviets of Peasants’ Deputies; the Bolshevik slogan therefore implies a powerresting on the overwhelmingly greater part of the entire democracyof Russia. 
 In that case, however, the slogan ‘All Power to the Soviets’ loses all independent significance, for it makes the Soviets almost identical in composition to the Pre-parliament set up by the Con-ference.... 
” (Novaya Zhizn ’s assertion is a brazen lie, equivalent to declaring that spurious and fraudulent democracy is “almost identical” to democracy: the Pre-parliamentis a sham which passes off the will of the minority of the people, particularly of Kuskova, Berkenheim, Chaikovskyand Co. 
, as the will of the majority. 
 This is the firstpoint. 
 The second point is that at the Conference even the Peasants’ Soviets that had been packed by the Avksen-tyevs and Chaikovskys gave such a high percentage opposedto the coalition that taken together with the Soviets ofWorkers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies, they would have broughtabout the absolute collapse of the coalition . 
 And the third point is that “Power to the Soviets” means that the power of the Peasants’ Soviets would embrace mainly the rural districts, and in the rural districts the predominance ofthe poor peasants is assured. 
) “If it is one and the same thing, then the Bolshevik slogan should be immediately withdrawn. 
 If, however, ‘Power to the Soviets’ is only a disguise for the dictatorship of the proletariat, then such apower would mean precisely the failure and collapse of the revolution. 
 “Does it need proof that the proletariat, isolated not only from the other classes in the country, but also from the real live forces ofthe democracy, will not be able either technically to lay hold of the state apparatus and set it in motion in an exceptionally complicated situation, or politically to resist all the pressure by hostile forcesthat will sweep away not only the proletarian dictatorship, but theentire revolution into the bargain? “The only power that will answer the requirements of the present situation is a really honest coalition within the democracy. 
” * * * We apologise to the reader for quoting these lengthy extracts, but they are absolutely necessary. 
 It is necessaryto present a precise picture of the positions taken by thedifferent parties hostile to the Bolsheviks. 
 It is necessaryto prove in a definite manner the extremely important fact that all these parties have admitted that the question of the Bolsheviks taking full state power alone is not only feasible, but also urgent. 
 Let us now proceed to examine the arguments which con-vince “everybody”, from the Cadets to the Novaya Zhizn people, that the Bolsheviks will not be able to retain power. 
 The respectable Rech advances no arguments whatsoever. 
 It merely pours out upon the Bolsheviks a flood of the choicest and most irate abuse. 
 The extract we quoted shows, among other things, how utterly wrong it would be to say,“Watch out, comrades, for what the enemy advises mustcertainly be bad”, thinking that Rech is “provoking” the Bolsheviks to take power. 
 If, instead of weighing up thegeneral and concrete considerations in a practical way, we allow ourselves to be “persuaded” by the plea that the bourgeoisie are “provoking” us to take power, we shallbe fooled by the bourgeoisie, for the latter will of coursealways maliciously prophesy millions of disasters that willresult from the Bolsheviks taking power and will alwaysmaliciously shout, “It would be better to get rid of the Bolsheviks at one blow and ‘for many a year’ by allowing them to take power and then crushing them. 
” These criesare also “provocation”, if you will, but from a differentangle. 
 The Cadets and the bourgeoisie do not by any means“advise”, and have never “advised”, us to take power; theyare only trying to frighten us with the allegedly insoluble problems of government. 
 No. 
 We must not allow ourselves to be frightened by the screams of the frightened bourgeoisie. 
 We must bearfirmly in mind that we have never set ourselves “insol-uble” social problems, and as for the perfectly soluble prob-lem of taking immediate steps towards socialism, which is the only way out of the exceedingly difficult situation, that will be solved only by the dictatorship of the prole-tariat and poor peasants. 
 Victory, and lasting victory, isnow more than ever, more than anywhere else, assured for theproletariat in Russia if it takes power. 
 We shall in a purely practical manner discuss the con-crete circumstances that make a certain moment unfavour-able; but we shall not for a moment allow ourselves to bescared by the savage howls of the bourgeoisie; and we shall not forget that the question of the Bolsheviks taking full power is becoming really urgent . 
 Our Party will now be threatened with an immeasurably greater danger if we forget this than if we were to admit that taking power is“premature”. 
 In this respect, there can be nothing “pre-mature” now: there is every chance in a million, except oneor two perhaps, in favour of this. 
 Concerning the irate abuse poured out by Rech , we can, and must, say: In savage cries of irritation We hear the voice of approbation,Not in dulcet sounds of praise . 
 52 That the bourgeoisie hate us so passionately is one of the most striking proofs that we are showing the people the right ways and means of overthrowing the rule of the bourgeoisie. 
 * * * This time, by way of rare exception, Dyelo Naroda did not deign to honour us with its abuse nor did it advance a ghost of an argument. 
 It merely tried, by indirect hints,to frighten us with the prospect that “the Bolsheviks will be obliged to form a cabinet”. 
 I can quite believe that whiletrying to frighten us, the Socialist-Revolutionaries arethemselves sincerely seared to death by the phantom of the frightened liberal. 
 I can equally believe that the Socialist-Revolutionaries do succeed in certain exceptionally highand exceptionally rotten institutions, such as the CentralExecutive Committee and similar “contact” (i. 
e. 
, contactwith the Cadets, in plain language, hobnobbing with theCadets) commissions, in scaring some Bolsheviks because, first, the atmosphere in all those Central Executives, pre-parliaments, etc. 
, is abominable, putrid to the point ofnausea, and harmful for any man to breathe for any length of time; and secondly, sincerity is contagious, and a sin-cerely frightened philistine is capable of converting evenan individual revolutionary into a philistine for a time. 
 But however much we may, “humanly” speaking, under-stand the sincere fright of a Socialist-Revolutionary whohas had the misfortune to be a minister in the company of the Cadets, or who is eligible as a minister in the eyes of the Cadets, we would be committing a political error that might only too easily border on treachery to the proletar-iat if we allowed ourselves to be scared. 
 Let us have yourpractical arguments, gentlemen! Cherish no hope that weshall allow ourselves to be scared by your fright! * * * This time we find practical arguments only in Novaya Zhizn . 
 On this occasion the paper comes out in the role of counsel for the bourgeoisie, a role that suits it far betterthan that of counsel for the defence of the Bolsheviks,which so obviously “shocks” this lady with many good points. 
 53 The counsel has advanced six pleas: (1) the proletariat is “isolated from the other classes in the country”; (2) it is “isolated from the real live forces of the democracy”;(3) it “will not be able technically to lay hold of the state apparatus”; (4) it “will not be able to set this apparatus in motion”; (5) “the situation is exceptionally complicated”; (6) it “will be incapable of resisting all the pressure by hostile forces that will sweep away not only the proletariandictatorship, but the entire revolution into the bar-gain”. 
 Novaya Zhizn formulates the first plea in a ridiculously clumsy fashion, for in capitalist and semi-capitalist societywe know of only three classes: the bourgeoisie, the pettybourgeoisie (which consists mainly of the peasantry), andthe proletariat. 
 What sense is there in talking about the proletariat being isolated from the other classes when the point at issue is the proletariat’s struggle against thebourgeoisie, revolution against the bourgeoisie? Evidently, Novaya Zhizn wanted to say that the proletar-iat is isolated from the peasants, for it could not possiblyhave meant the landowners. 
 It could not, however, say clearly and definitely that the proletariat is now isolated from the peasants, for the utter incorrectness of this asser-tion would be too obvious. 
 It is difficult to imagine that in a capitalist country the proletariat should be so little isolated from the petty bourgeoisie—and, mark you, in a revolution against the bourgeoisie —as the proletariat now is in Russia. 
 The latest returns of the voting by “curias” for and against coalition with the bourgeoisie in Tsereteli’s “Bulygin Duma”, i. 
e. 
,in the notorious “Democratic” Conference, constitute one ofthe objective and incontrovertible proofs of this. 
 If we take the Soviets’ curias we get: For coali-Against tion Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies .......... 
 83192 Soviets of Peasants’ Deputies . 
. 
 102 70 All Soviets 185 262 So, the majority as a whole is on the side of the pro-letarian slogan: against coalition with the bourgeoisie. 
 We have seen above that even the Cadets are obliged to admit the growth of Bolshevik influence in the Soviets. 
 And here we have the Conference convened by yesterday ’s leaders in the Soviets, Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, who havean assured majority in the central institutions! Obviously,the actual degree to which the Bolsheviks predominate in the Soviets is here understated . 
 Both on the question of coalition with the bourgeoisie and on the question of immediately transferring the landedestates to peasant committees, the Bolsheviks already have amajority in the Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’ Deputies, a majority of the people , a majority of the petty bourgeoisie. 
 Rabochy Put No. 
 19, of September 24 quotes from No. 
 25 of the organ of the Socialist-Revolutionaries Znamya Truda 54 a report on a conference of local Soviets of Peasants’ Deputies held in Petrograd on September 18. 
At this conference the Executive Committees of four Peasants’Soviets (Kostroma, Moscow, Samara and Taurida guber-nias) voted for an unrestricted coalition. 
 The Executive Committees of three gubernias and two armies (Vladimir, Ryazan and the Black Sea gubernias) voted in favour ofa coalition without the Cadets. 
 The Executive Committees of twenty-three gubernias and four armies voted against a coalition. 
 So, the majority of the peasants are against a coalition! So much for the “isolation of the proletariat”. 
We should note, by the way, that the supporters of a coalition were three outlying gubernias, Samara, Taurida andthe Black Sea, where there is a relatively very large numberof rich peasants and big landowners who employ hired labour, and also four industrial gubernias (Vladimir, Ryazan, Kostroma and Moscow) in which the peasant bourgeoisieare also stronger than in the majority of the gubernias inRussia. 
 It would be interesting to collect more detailedfigures on this question and to ascertain whether informa-tion is available concerning the poor peasants in the guber-nias where there are larger numbers of “ rich ” peasants. 
 It is interesting, moreover, that the “non-Russian groups”revealed a considerable predominance of opponents of acoalition, namely, 40 votes against 15. 
 The policy of annexa-tion and open violence pursued by the BonapartistKerensky and Co. 
 towards the non-sovereign nations of Russia has borne fruit. 
 Wide sections of the people of the oppressed nations (i. 
e. 
, including the mass of the petty bour-geoisie) trust the proletariat of Russia more than they do thebourgeoisie, for here history has brought to the fore the strug-gle for liberation of the oppressed nations against the op-pressing nations. 
 The bourgeoisie has despicably betrayed the cause of freedom of the oppressed nations; the proletariat is faithful to the cause of freedom. 
 At the present time the national and agrarian questions are fundamental questions for the petty-bourgeois sections ofthe population of Russia. 
 This is indisputable. 
 And on boththese questions the proletariat is “ not isolated”—farther from it than ever. 
 It has the majority of the people behind it. 
 It alone is capable of pursuing such a determined, gen-uinely “revolutionary-democratic” policy on both questionswhich would immediately ensure the proletarian state powernot only the support of the majority of the population, butalso a real outburst of revolutionary enthusiasm among the people. 
 This is because, for the first time, the people would not see the ruthless oppression of peasants by landownersand of Ukrainians by Great Russians on the part of the government, as was the case under tsarism, nor the effort to continue the same policy camouflaged in pompous phrases under the republic, nor nagging, insult, chicanery, procras-tination, underhand dealing and evasions (all that withwhich Kerensky rewards the peasants and the oppressednations), but would receive warm sympathy proved bydeeds, immediate and revolutionary measures against thelandowners, immediate restitution of full freedom for Finland, the Ukraine, Byelorussia, for the Moslems, and so on. 
 The Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik gentlemen know this perfectly well, and are therefore dragging in thesemi-Cadet bosses of the co-operative societies to help thempursue their reactionary -democratic policy against the peo-ple. 
 That is why they will never dare canvass popular opinion, take a popular referendum, or at least a vote of all the localSoviets, of all the local organisations, concerning definitepoints of practical policy, for example, whether all the landedestates should at once be handed over to peasant committees,whether certain demands of the Finns or the Ukrainians should be conceded, etc. 
 Take the question of peace, the crucial issue of today. 
 The proletariat “is isolated from the other classes”.... 
 Onthis issue the proletariat truly represents the whole nation, all live and honest people in all classes, the vast majority of the petty bourgeoisie; because only the proletariat, on achieving power, will immediately offer a just peace to all the belligerent nations, because only the proletariat willdare take genuinely revolutionary measures (publication of the secret treaties, and so forth) to achieve the speediestand most just peace possible. 
 The proletariat is not isolated. 
 The gentlemen of Novaya Zhizn who are shouting about the proletariat being isolated are only betraying their subjective fear of the bourgeoisie. 
The objective state of affairs in Russia is undoubtedly suchthat the proletariat, precisely at the present time , is not “isolated” from the majority of the petty bourgeoisie. 
 Pre-cisely now, after the sad experience with the “coalition”, the proletariat enjoys the sympathy of the majority of the people. 
 This condition for the retention of power by the Bolsheviks does exist . 
 * * * The second plea is that the proletariat “is isolated from the real live forces of the democracy”. 
 What this means isincomprehensible. 
 It is probably “Greek”, as the Frenchsay in such cases. 
 The writers of Novaya Zhizn would make good ministers. 
 They would be quite suitable as ministers in a Cadet cabinet because all these ministers need is the ability to spout plausible, polished, but utterly meaningless phrases withwhich to cover up the dirtiest work and which are thereforesure of winning the applause of the imperialists and social-imperialists. 
 The Novaya Zhizn writers are sure to earn the applause of the Cadets, Breshkovskaya, Plekhanov and Co. 
 for asserting that the proletariat is isolated from the real live forces of the democracy, because indirectly they imply— or will be understood to imply—that the Cadets, Breshkov-skaya, Plekhanov, Kerensky and Co. 
 are the “live forces ofdemocracy”. 
 This is not true. 
 They are dead forces. 
 The history of the coalition has proved this. 
 Overawed by the bourgeoisie and by their bourgeois-intellectual environment, the Novaya Zhizn people regard as “live” the Right wing of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks like Volya Naroda 55, Yedinstvo , and others who in essentials do not differ from the Cadets. 
 We, however, regard as live only those who are connected with the people and not with the kulaks, only those whom the lessons of thecoalition have repelled. 
 The “active live forces” of thepetty-bourgeois democracy are represented by the Left wingof the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks. 
 That thiswing has gained strength, particularly since the July counter-revolution, is one of the surest objective signs that the pro-letariat is not isolated. 
 This has been made even more strikingly evident by the very recent swing to the left of the Socialist-RevolutionaryCentrists, as is proved by Chernov’s statement on Septem-ber 24 that his group cannot support the new coalition with Kishkin and Co. 
 This swing to the left of the Socialist-Revolutionary Centre, which up to now had constituted theoverwhelming majority of the members of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, the leading and dominant party from the point of view of the number of votes it obtained in the urban and particularly in the rural districts, proves that the statements we quoted from Dyelo Naroda that the democracy must, under certain circumstances, “guarantee full support”for a purely Bolshevik government are at any rate not mereempty phrases. 
 Facts like the refusal of the Socialist-Revolutionary Centre to support the new coalition with Kishkin, or the predominance of the opponents of the coalition among the Menshevik-defencists in the provinces (Jordania in the Caucasus, etc. 
), are objective proof that a certain sectionof the people which has up to now followed the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries will support a purely Bolshe-vik government. 
 It is precisely from the live forces of the democracy that the proletariat of Russia is now not isolated. 
 * * * The third plea, that the proletariat “will not be able technically to lay hold of the state apparatus” is, perhaps,the most common and most frequent. 
 It deserves most atten-tion for this reason, and also because it indicates one ofthe most serious and difficult tasks that will confront the victorious proletariat. 
 There is no doubt that these tasks will be very difficult, but if we, who call ourselves socialists, indicate this difficulty only to shirk these tasks, in practice the distinction between us and the lackeys of the bourgeoisiewill be reduced to nought. 
 The difficulty of the tasks of theproletarian revolution should prompt the proletariat’s sup-porters to make a closer and more definite study of the means of carrying out these tasks. 
 The state apparatus is primarily the standing army, the police and the bureaucracy. 
 By saying that the proletariatwill not he able technically to lay hold of this apparatus,the writers of Novaya Zhizn reveal their utter ignorance and their reluctance to take into account either facts or the arguments long ago cited in Bolshevik literature. 
 All the Novaya Zhizn writers regard themselves, if not as Marxists, then at least as being familiar with Marxism, as educated socialists. 
 But Marx, basing himself on the experience of the Paris Commune, taught that the proletar-iat cannot simply lay hold of the ready-made state machine and use it for its own purposes, that the proletariat mustsmash this machine and substitute a new one for it (I dealwith this in greater detail in a pamphlet, the first part ofwhich is now finished and will soon appear under the titleThe State and Revolution. 
 A Marxist Theory of the State and the Tasks of the Proletariat in the Revolution *). 
 This new type of state machinery was created by the Paris Com-mune, and the Russian Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’ andPeasants’ Deputies are a “state apparatus” of the same type . 
 I have indicated this many times since April 4, 1917; it is dealtwith in the resolutions of Bolshevik conferences and also in Bolshevik literature. 
 Novaya Zhizn could, of course, have expressed its utter disagreement with Marx and with the Bol-sheviks, but for a paper that has so often, and so haughtily,scolded the Bolsheviks for their allegedly frivolous attitudeto difficult problems to evade this question completely istantamount to issuing itself a certificate of mental po-verty. 
 The proletariat cannot “lay hold of” the “state appara-tus” and “set it in motion”. 
 But it can smash everything that is oppressive, routine, incorrigibly bourgeois in theold state apparatus and substitute its own , new apparatus. 
 The Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’ Deputies are exactly this apparatus. 
 That Novaya Zhizn has completely forgotten about this “state apparatus” can be called nothing but monstrous. 
Behaving in this way in their theoretical reasoning, theNovaya Zhizn people are, in essence, doing in the sphere of political theory what the Cadets are doing in political prac-tice. 
 Because, if the proletariat and the revolutionary dem-ocrats do not in fact need a new state apparatus, then the Soviets lose their raison d ’être, lose their right to existence, and the Kornilovite Cadets are right in trying to reduce the Soviets to nought! This monstrous theoretical blunder and political blind-ness on the part of Novaya Zhizn is all the more monstrous *See present edition, Vol. 
 25. 
— Ed. 
 because even the internationalist Mensheviks (with whom Novaya Zhizn formed a bloc during the last City Council elections in Petrograd) have on this question shown some proximity to the Bolsheviks. 
 So, in the declaration of theSoviet majority made by Comrade Martov at the DemocraticConference, we read: “The Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’ Deputies, set up in the first days of the revolution by a mighty burst of creative enthusiasm that stems from the people themselves, constitute the newfabric of the revolutionary state that has replaced the outworn statefabric of the old regime.... 
” This is a little too flowery; that is to say, rhetoric here covers up lack of clear political thinking. 
 The Soviets have not yet replaced the old “fabric”, and this old “fabric” is not the state fabric of the old regime, but the state fabric of both tsarism and of the bourgeois republic. 
 But at any rate, Martov here stands head and shoulders above Novaya Zhizn . 
 The Soviets are a new state apparatus which, in the first place, provides an armed force of workers and peasants; and this force is not divorced from the people, as was theold standing army, but is very closely bound up with thepeople. 
 From the military point of view this force is incom-parably more powerful than previous forces; from the rev-olutionary point of view, it cannot be replaced by any-thing else. 
 Secondly, this apparatus provides a bond with the people, with the majority of the people, so intimate, soindissoluble, so easily verifiable and renewable, thatnothing even remotely like it existed in the previous stateapparatus. 
 Thirdly, this apparatus, by virtue of the factthat its personnel is elected and subject to recall at the people’s will without any bureaucratic formalities, is far more democratic than any previous apparatus. 
 Fourthly,it provides a close contact with the most varied professions,thereby facilitating the adoption of the most varied and mostradical reforms without red tape. 
 Fifthly, it provides an or-ganisational form for the vanguard, i. 
e. 
, for the most class-conscious, most energetic and most progressive section of the oppressed classes, the workers and peasants, and so constitutes an apparatus by means of which the vanguard of the oppressed classes can elevate, train, educate, and lead the entire vast mass of these classes, which has up to now stood completely outside of political life and history. 
 Sixth-ly, it makes it possible to combine the advantages of theparliamentary system with those of immediate and directdemocracy, i. 
e. 
, to vest in the people’s elected representa-tives both legislative and executive functions. 
 Compared with the bourgeois parliamentary system, this is an advance in democracy’s development which is of world-wide, historic significance. 
 In 1905, our Soviets existed only in embryo, so to speak, as they lived altogether only a few weeks. 
 Clearly, underthe conditions of that time, their comprehensive develop-ment was out of the question. 
 It is still out of the question in the 1917 Revolution, for a few months is an extremely short period and—this is most important—the Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik leaders have prostituted the Soviets, have reduced their role to that of a talking shop,of an accomplice in the compromising policy of the leaders. 
The Soviets have been rotting and decaying alive under the leadership of the Liebers, Dans, Tseretelis and Cher-novs. 
 The Soviets will be able to develop properly, to dis-play their potentialities and capabilities to the full onlyby taking over full state power; for otherwise they have nothing to do , otherwise they are either simply embryos (and to remain an embryo too long is fatal), or playthings. 
 “Dual power” means paralysis for the Soviets. 
 If the creative enthusiasm of the revolutionary classes had not given rise to the Soviets, the proletarian revolutionin Russia would have been a hopeless cause, for the proletar-iat could certainly not retain power with the old stateapparatus, and it is impossible to create a new apparatus immediately. 
 The sad history of the prostitution of the Soviets by the Tseretelis and Chernovs, the history of the“coalition”, is also the history of the liberation of the So-viets from petty-bourgeois illusions, of their passagethrough the “purgatory” of the practical experience of theutter abomination and filth of all and sundry bourgeois coalitions. 
 Let us hope that this “purgatory” has steeled rather than weakened the Soviets. 
 * * * The chief difficulty facing the proletarian revolution is the establishment on a country-wide scale of the most pre-cise and most conscientious accounting and control, ofworkers ’ control of the production and distribution of goods. 
 When the writers of Novaya Zhizn argued that in advancing the slogan “workers’ control” we were slipping into syndi-calism, this argument was an example of the stupid school-boy method of applying “Marxism” without studying it,just learning it by rote in the Struve manner. 
 Syndicalism either repudiates the revolutionary dictatorship of theproletariat, or else relegates it, as it does political power ingeneral, to a back seat. 
 We, however, put it in the forefront. 
 If we simply say in unison with the Novaya Zhizn writers: not workers’ control but state control, it is simply a bourgeois-reformist phrase, it is, in essence, a purely Cadet for-mula, because the Cadets have no objection to the workersparticipating in “state” control. 
 The Kornilovite Cadets know perfectly well that such participation offers the bour-geoisie the best way of fooling the workers, the most subtle way of politically bribing all the Gvozdyovs, Nikitins, Pro-kopoviches, Tseretelis and the rest of that gang. 
 When we say: “workers’ control”, always juxtaposing this slogan to dictatorship of the proletariat, always put-ting it immediately after the latter, we thereby explain what kind of state we mean. 
 The state is the organ of class dom-ination. 
 Of which class? If of the bourgeoisie, then it is theCadet-Kornilov-“Kerensky” state which has been “Korni-lovising” and “Kerenskyising” the working people of Russiafor more than six months. 
 If it is of the proletariat, if weare speaking of a proletarian state, that is , of the proletarian dictatorship, then workers’ control can become the country-wide, all-embracing, omnipresent, most precise and mostconscientious accounting of the production and distribution of goods. 
 This is the chief difficulty, the chief task that faces the pro-letarian, i. 
e. 
, socialist, revolution. 
 Without the Soviets, this task would be impracticable, at least in Russia. 
 The Soviets indicate to the proletariat the organisational work which can solve this historically important problem. 
 /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR This brings us to another aspect of the question of the state apparatus. 
 In addition to the chiefly “oppressive” apparatus—the standing army, the police and the bureaucra-cy—the modern state possesses an apparatus which hasextremely close connections with the banks and syndicates,an apparatus which performs an enormous amount of account-ing and registration work, if it may be expressed this way. 
This apparatus must not, and should not, be smashed. 
 It must be wrested from the control of the capitalists; the capitalists and the wires they pull must be cut off , lopped off , chopped away from this apparatus; it must be subordinated to the proletarian Soviets; it must be expanded, made morecomprehensive, and nation-wide. 
 And this can be done by utilising the achievements already made by large-scale capi-talism (in the same way as the proletarian revolution can, in general, reach its goal only by utilising these achievements). 
 Capitalism has created an accounting apparatus in the shape of the banks, syndicates, postal service, consumers’societies, and office employees’ unions. 
 Without big banks socialism would be impossible . 
 The big banks are the “state apparatus” which we need to bring about socialism, and which we take ready-made from capitalism; our task here is merely to lop off what capitalistically mutilates this excellent apparatus, to make it even bigger , even more democratic, even more comprehen-sive. 
 Quantity will be transformed into quality. 
 A single State Bank, the biggest of the big, with branches in every rural district, in every factory, will constitute as much asnine-tenths of the socialist apparatus. 
 This will be country-wide book-keeping , country-wide accounting of the production and distribution of goods, this will be, so to speak, some-thing in the nature of the skeleton of socialist society. 
 We can “lay hold of” and “set in motion” this “state ap-paratus” (which is not fully a state apparatus under capi-talism, but which will be so with us, under socialism) atone stroke, by a single decree, because the actual work ofbook-keeping, control, registering, accounting and count-ing is performed by employees , the majority of whom them-selves lead a proletarian or semi-proletarian existence. 
 By a single decree of the proletarian government these employees can and must be transferred to the status of state employees, in the same way as the watchdogs of capitalism like Briand and other bourgeois ministers, by a single de-cree, transfer railwaymen on strike to the status of state employees. 
 We shall need many more state employees of thiskind, and more can be obtained, because capitalism has sim-plified the work of accounting and control, has reduced it toa comparatively simple system of book-keeping , which any literate person can do. 
 The conversion of the bank, syndicate, commercial, etc. 
, etc. 
, rank-and-file employees into state employees is quitefeasible both technically (thanks to the preliminary workperformed for us by capitalism, including finance capitalism)and politically, provided the Soviets exercise control and su-pervision. 
 As for the higher officials, of whom there are very few, but who gravitate towards the capitalists, they will haveto be dealt with in the same way as the capitalists, i. 
e. 
,“severely”. 
 Like the capitalists, they will offer resistance . 
 This resistance will have to be broken , and if the immortally-naïve Peshekhonov, as early as June 1917, lisped like the infant that he was in state affairs, that “the resistance of the capitalists has been broken”, this childish phrase, thischildish boast, this childish swagger, will be converted by the proletariat into reality . 
 We can do this, for it is merely a question of breaking the resistance of an insignificant minority of the population, literally a handful of people, over each of whom the emplo-yees’ unions, the trade unions, the consumers’ societiesand the Soviets will institute such supervision that every Tit Titych will be surrounded as the French were at Sedan. 
 56 We know these Tit Tityches by name: we only have to con-sult the lists of directors, board members, large shareholders, etc. 
 There are several hundred, at most several thousand of them in the whole of Russia, and the proletarian state, with the apparatus of the Soviets, of the employees’ unions,etc. 
, will be able to appoint ten or even a hundred supervisersto each of them, so that instead of “breaking resistance”it may even be possible, by means of workers ’ control (over the capitalists), to make all resistance impossible . 
 The important thing will not be even the confiscation of the capitalists’ property, but country-wide, all-embrac-ing workers’ control over the capitalists and their possible supporters. 
 Confiscation alone leads nowhere, as it does not contain the element of organisation, of accounting for proper distribution. 
 Instead of confiscation, we couldeasily impose a fair tax (even on the Shingaryov 57 scale, for instance), taking care, of course, to preclude the possibil-ity of anyone evading assessment, concealing the truth,evading the law. 
 And this possibility can be eliminated only by the workers’ control of the workers ’ state . 
 Compulsory syndication , i. 
e. 
, compulsory amalgamation in associations under state control—this is what capitalismhas prepared the way for, this is what has been carried out inGermany by the Junkers’ state, this is what can be easilycarried out in Russia by the Soviets, by the proletarian dic-tatorship, and this is what will provide us with a state apparatus that will be universal, up-to-date, and non-bu-reaucratic. 
 * * * * The fourth plea of the counsels for the bourgeoisie is that the proletariat will not be able “to set the state appa-ratus in motion”. 
 There is nothing new in this plea com-pared with the preceding one. 
 We could not, of course, eitherlay hold of or set in motion the old apparatus. 
 The new appa-ratus, the Soviets, has already been set in motion by “a mighty burst of creative enthusiasm that stems from the peoplethemselves”. 
 We only have to free it from the shackles put on it by the domination of the Socialist-Revolutionary andMenshevik leaders. 
 This apparatus is already in motion; we only have to free it from the monstrous, petty-bourgeoisimpediments preventing it from going full speed ahead. 
 Two circumstances must be considered here to supplement what has already been said. 
 In the first place, the new meansof control have been created not by us, but by capitalism in its military-imperialist stage; and in the second place, itis important to introduce more democracy into the admin-istration of a proletarian state. 
 *For further details of the meaning of compulsory syndication see my pamphlet: The Impending Catastrophe and How to Combat It . 
 (See present edition, Vol. 
 25, pp. 
 346-49. 
— Ed. 
) The grain monopoly and bread rationing were introduced not by us, but by the capitalist state in war-time. 
 It had already introduced universal labour conscription within the framework of capitalism, which is war-time penal servitudefor the workers. 
 But here too, as in all its history-makingactivities, the proletariat takes its weapons from capitalismand does not “invent” or “create them out of nothing”. 
 The grain monopoly, bread rationing and labour conscrip-tion in the hands of the proletarian state, in the hands of sovereign Soviets, will be the most powerful means of ac-counting and control, means which, applied to the capitalists,and to the rich in general , applied to them by the workers, will provide a force unprecedented in history for “setting thestate apparatus in motion”, for overcoming the resistance of the capitalists, for subordinating them to the proletarian state. 
 These means of control and of compelling people to work will be more potent than the laws of the Convention and its guillotine. 
 The guillotine only terrorised, only broke active resistance. 
 For us , this is not enough . 
 For us, this is not enough. 
 We must not only “terrorise” the capitalists, i. 
e. 
, make them feel the omnipotence of the proletarian state and give up all idea of actively resistingit. 
 We must also break passive resistance, which is undoubted-ly more dangerous and harmful. 
 We must not only breakresistance of every kind. 
 We must also compel the capitalists to work within the framework of the new state organisation. 
 It is not enough to “remove” the capitalists; we must (after removing the undesirable and incorrigible “resisters”) em-ploy them in the service of the new state . 
 This applies both to the capitalists and to the upper section of the bourgeois in-tellectuals, office employees, etc. 
 And we have the means to do this. 
 The means and instru-ments for this have been placed in our hands by the capital-ist state in the war. 
 These means are the grain monopoly,bread rationing and labour conscription. 
 “He who does notwork, neither shall he eat”—this is the fundamental, thefirst and most important rule the Soviets of Workers’Deputies can and will introduce when they become the ru-ling power. 
 Every worker has a work-book. 
 This book does not degrade him, although at present it is undoubtedly a docu-ment of capitalist wage-slavery, certifying that the workman belongs to some parasite. 
 The Soviets will introduce work-books for the rich and then gradually for the whole population (in a peasant coun-try work-books will probably not be needed for a long timefor the overwhelming majority of the peasants). 
 The work-book will cease to be the badge of the “common herd”, adocument of the “lower” orders, a certificate of wage-slavery. 
 It will become a document certifying that in the new society there are no longer any “workmen”, nor, on the other hand,are there any longer men who do not work . 
 The rich will be obliged to get a work-book from the workers’ or office employees’ union with which their occupa-tion is most closely connected, and every week, or other definite fixed period, they will have to get from that union a certificate to the effect that they are performing theirwork conscientiously; without this they will not be able toreceive bread ration cards or provisions in general. 
 Theproletarian state will say: we need good organisers of bank-ing and the amalgamation of enterprises (in this matter the capitalists have more experience, and it is easier to work with experienced people), and we need far, far more engi-neers, agronomists, technicians and scientifically trainedspecialists of every kind than were needed before. 
 We shallgive all these specialists work to which they are accustomedand which they can cope with; in all probability we shall introduce complete wage equality only gradually and shall pay these specialists higher salaries during the transitionperiod. 
 We shall place them, however, under comprehensiveworkers’ control and we shall achieve the complete andabsolute operation of the rule “He who does not work, neithershall he eat. 
” We shall not invent the organisational form of the work, but take it ready-made from capitalism—we shall take over the banks, syndicates, the best factories, experi-mental stations, academies, and so forth; all that we shallhave to do is to borrow the best models furnished by theadvanced countries. 
 Of course, we shall not in the least descend to a utopia, we are not deserting the soil of most sober, practical reason when we say that the entire capitalist class will offer themost stubborn resistance, but this resistance will be broken by the organisation of the entire population in Soviets. 
 Those capitalists who are exceptionally stubborn and recalcitrant will, of course, have to be punished by the con-fiscation of their whole property and by imprisonment. 
 Onthe other hand, however, the victory of the proletariatwill bring about an increase in the number of cases of the kind that I read about in today’s Izvestia for example: “On September 26, two engineers came to the Central Council of Factory Committees to report that a group of engineers had decided to form a union of socialist engineers. 
 The Union believes that thepresent time is actually the beginning of the social revolution andplaces itself at the disposal of the working people, desiring, in defenceof the workers’ interests, to work in complete unity with the workers’organisations. 
 The representatives of the Central Council of Factory Committees answered that the Council will gladly set up in its organ-isation an Engineers’ Section which will embody in its programmethe main theses of the First Conference of Factory Committees onworkers’ control over production. 
 A joint meeting of delegates of theCentral Council of Factory Committees and of the initiative groupof socialist engineers will be held within the next few days. 
” ( Izvestia , September 27, 1917. 
) * * * The proletariat, we are told, will not be able to set the state apparatus in motion. 
 Since the 1905 revolution, Russia has been governed by 130,000 landowners, who have perpetrated endless violenceagainst 150,000,000 people, heaped unconstrained abuse upon them, and condemned the vast majority to inhuman toil and semi-starvation. 
 Yet we are told that the 240,000 members of the Bolshe-vik Party will not be able to govern Russia, govern her inthe interests of the poor and against the rich. 
 These 240,000are already backed by no less than a million votes of the adult population, for this is precisely the proportion be-tween the number of Party members and the number of votescast for the Party that has been established by the experienceof Europe and the experience of Russia as shown, for exam-ple, by the elections to the Petrograd City Council lastAugust. 
 We therefore already have a “state apparatus” of one million people devoted to the socialist state for the sake of high ideals and not for the sake of a fat sum receivedon the 20th of every month. 
 In addition to that we have a “magic way” to enlarge our state apparatus tenfold at once, at one stroke, a way which no capitalist state ever possessed or could possess. 
 This magic way is to draw the working people, to draw the poor, into thedaily work of state administration. 
 To explain how easy it will be to employ this magic way and how faultlessly it will operate, let us take the simplestand most striking example possible. 
 The state is to forcibly evict a certain family from a flat and move another in. 
 This often happens in the capitaliststate, and it will also happen in our proletarian or socialiststate. 
 The capitalist state evicts a working-class family which has lost its breadwinner and cannot pay the rent. 
 The bailiff appears with police, or militia, a whole squad of them. 
 To effect an eviction in a working-class district a whole detach-ment of Cossacks is required. 
 Why? Because the bailiff andthe militiaman refuse to go without a very strong militaryguard. 
 They know that the scene of an eviction arouses suchfury among the neighbours, among thousands and thousands of people who have been driven to the verge of desperation, arouses such hatred towards the capitalists and the capital-ist state, that the bailiff and the squad of militiamen runthe risk of being torn to pieces at any minute. 
 Large mili-tary forces are required, several regiments must be broughtinto a big city, and the troops must come from some distant, outlying region so that the soldiers will not be familiar with the life of the urban poor, so that the soldiers will not be“infected” with socialism. 
 The proletarian state has to forcibly move a very poor family into a rich man’s flat. 
 Let us suppose that our squadof workers’ militia is fifteen strong; two sailors, two sol-diers, two class-conscious workers (of whom, let us suppose, only one is a member of our Party, or a sympathiser), oneintellectual, and eight from the poor working people, ofwhom at least five must be women, domestic servants, un-skilled labourers, and so forth. 
 The squad arrives at the richman’s flat, inspects it and finds that it consists of five rooms occupied by two men and two women—“You must squeeze up a bit into two rooms this winter, citizens, and preparetwo rooms for two families now living in cellars. 
 Until the time, with the aid of engineers (you are an engineer, aren’t you?), we have built good dwellings for everybody, you will have to squeeze up a little. 
 Your telephone will serve ten families. 
 This will save a hundred hours of work wasted onshopping, and so forth. 
 Now in your family there are twounemployed persons who can perform light work: a citizen-ess fifty-five years of age and a citizen fourteen years of age. 
They will be on duty for three hours a day supervising the proper distribution of provisions for ten families and keep-ing the necessary account of this. 
 The student citizen inour squad will now write out this state order in two copiesand you will be kind enough to give us a signed declarationthat you will faithfully carry it out. 
” This, in my opinion, can illustrate how the distinction between the old bourgeois and the new socialist state appa-ratus and state administration could be illustrated. 
 We are not utopians. 
 We know that an unskilled labourer or a cook cannot immediately get on with the job of stateadministration. 
 In this we agree with the Cadets, withBreshkovskaya, and with Tsereteli. 
 We differ, however, from these citizens in that we demand an immediate break with the prejudiced view that only the rich, or officialschosen from rich families, are capable of administering the state, of performing the ordinary, everyday work of admin-istration. 
 We demand that training in the work of state administration be conducted by class-conscious workers and soldiers and that this training be begun at once, i.

, that a beginning be made at once in training all the working people, all the poor, for this work. 
 We know that the Cadets are also willing to teach the people democracy. 
 Cadet ladies are willing to deliverlectures to domestic servants on equal rights for women in accordance with the best English and French sources. 
 And also, at the very next concert-meeting, before an audience ofthousands, an exchange of kisses will be arranged on theplatform: the Cadet lady lecturer will kiss Breshkovskaya,Breshkovskaya will kiss ex-Minister Tsereteli, and thegrateful people will therefore receive an object-lesson in republican equality, liberty and fraternity.... 
 Yes, we agree that the Cadets, Breshkovskaya and Tse-reteli are in their own way devoted to democracy and are propagating it among the people. 
 But what is to be done if our conception of democracy is somewhat different from theirs? In our opinion, to ease the incredible burdens and miseries of the war and also to heal the terrible wounds the warhas inflicted on the people, revolutionary democracy is needed, revolutionary measures of the kind described in the example of the distribution of housing accommodation in theinterests of the poor. 
 Exactly the same procedure must be adopted in both town and country for the distribution of provisions, clothing, footwear, etc. 
, in respect of the landin the rural districts, and so forth. 
 For the administration ofthe state in this spirit we can at once set in motion a state apparatus consisting of ten if not twenty million people, anapparatus such as no capitalist state has ever known. 
 We alone can create such an apparatus, for we are sure of the fullest and devoted sympathy of the vast majority of thepopulation. 
 We alone can create such an apparatus, becausewe have class-conscious workers disciplined by long capital-ist “schooling” (it was not for nothing that we went to learnin the school of capitalism), workers who are capable of forming a workers’ militia and of gradually expanding it (beginning to expand it at once) into a militia embracing the whole people . 
 The class-conscious workers must lead, but for the work of administration they can enlist the vast massof the working and oppressed people. 
 It goes without saying that this new apparatus is bound to make mistakes in taking its first steps. 
 But did not the peasants make mistakes when they emerged from serfdomand began to manage their own affairs? Is there any wayother than practice by which the people can learn to governthemselves and to avoid mistakes? Is there any way otherthan by proceeding immediately to genuine self-govern-ment by the people? The chief thing now is to abandon the prejudiced bourgeois-intellectualist view that only specialofficials, who by their very social position are entirelydependent upon capital, can administer the state. 
 The chiefthing is to put an end to the state of affairs in which bour-geois officials and “socialist” ministers are trying to govern in the old way, but are incapable of doing so and, after seven months, are faced with a peasant revolt in a peasant country!The chief thing is to imbue the oppressed and the working people with confidence in their own strength, to prove to them in practice that they can and must themselves ensure the proper , most strictly regulated and organised distribu-tion of bread, all kinds of food, milk, clothing, housing,etc. 
, in the interests of the poor . 
 Unless this is done, Russia cannot be saved from collapse and ruin. 
 The conscientious, bold, universal move to hand over administrative work toproletarians and semi-proletarians, will, however, rouse such unprecedented revolutionary enthusiasm among the people, will so multiply the people’s forces in combatingdistress, that much that seemed impossible to our narrow,old, bureaucratic forces will become possible for the millions,who will begin to work for themselves and not for the capitalists, the gentry, the bureaucrats, and not out of fear of punish-ment. 
 * * * Pertinent to the question of the state apparatus is also the question of centralism raised with unusual vehemenceand ineptitude by Comrade Bazarov in Novaya Zhizn No. 
 138, of September 27, in an article entitled: “The Bolsheviks and the Problem of Power”. 
 Comrade Bazarov reasons as follows: “The Soviets are not an apparatus suitable for all spheres of state life”, for,he says, seven months’ experience has shown, and “scoresand hundreds of documents in the possession of the Eco-nomic Department of the St. 
 Petersburg Executive Com-mittee” have confirmed, that the Soviets, although actual-ly enjoying “full power” in many places, “have not beenable to achieve anything like satisfactory results in combat-ing economic ruin”. 
 What is needed is an apparatus “dividedup according to branches of production, with strict cen-tralisation within each branch, and subordinated to one, country-wide centre”. 
 “It is a matter”, if you please, “not ofreplacing the old apparatus, but merely of reforming it ...no matter how much the Bolsheviks may jeer at people witha plan.... 
” All these arguments of Comrade Bazarov’s are positively amazing for their helplessness, they echo the arguments of the bourgeoisie and reflect their class point of view. 
 In fact, to say that the Soviets have anywhere in Russia ever enjoyed “full power” is simply ridiculous (if it is not a repetition of the selfish class lie of the capitalists). 
 Full power means power over all the land, over all the banks, over all the factories; a man who is at all familiar withthe facts of history and science on the connection betweenpolitics and economics could not have “forgotten” this“trifling” circumstance. 
 The bourgeoisie’s device is to withhold power from the Soviets, sabotage every important step they take, while at the same time retaining government in their own hands, retain-ing power over the land, the banks, etc. 
, and then throwingthe blame for the ruin upon the Soviets! This is exactly whatthe whole sad experience of the coalition amounts to. 
 The Soviets have never had full power, and the measures they have taken could not result in anything but pallia-tives that added to the confusion. 
 The effort to prove the necessity for centralism to the Bolsheviks who are centralists by conviction, by theirprogramme and by the entire tactics of their Party, is reallylike forcing an open door. 
 The writers of Novaya Zhizn are wasting their time only because they have totally failed to understand the meaning and significance of our jeers attheir “country-wide” point of view. 
 And the Novaya Zhizn people have failed to understand this because they merelypay lip-service to the doctrine of the class struggle, but do not accept it seriously. 
 Repeating the words about the class struggle they have learned by rote, they are constantly slipping into the “above-class point of view”, amusing intheory and reactionary in practice, and are calling thisfawning upon the bourgeoisie a “country-wide” plan. 
 The state, dear people, is a class concept. 
 The state is an organ or instrument of violence exercised by one class against another. 
 So long as it is an instrument of violence exercised by the bourgeoisie against the proletariat, the proletariatcan have only one slogan: destruction of this state. 
 But when the state will be a proletarian state, when it will be an in-strument of violence exercised by the proletariat against thebourgeoisie, we shall be fully and unreservedly in favour of a strong state power and of centralism. 
 To put it in more popular language, we do not jeer at “plans”, but at Bazarov and Co. 
’s failure to understand that by repudiating “workers’ control”, by repudiating the “dictatorship of the proletariat” they are for the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. 
 There is no middle course; a middle course is the futile dream of the petty-bourgeois democrat. 
 Not a single central body, not a single Bolshevik has ever argued against centralisation of the Soviets, against their amalgamation. 
 None of us objects to having factorycommittees in each branch of production, or to their cen-tralisation. 
 Bazarov is wide of the mark . 
 We laugh, have laughed, and will laugh not at “central-ism”, and not at “plans”, but at reformism , because, after the experience of the coalition, your reformism is utterlyridiculous. 
 And to say “not replace the apparatus but reformit” means to be a reformist, means to become not a revolu-tionary but a reformist democrat. 
 Reformism means nothing more than concessions on the part of the ruling class, butnot its overthrow; it makes concessions, but power remains in its hands . 
 This is precisely what has been tried during six months of the coalition. 
 This is what we laugh at. 
 Having failed to obtain a thor-ough grasp of the doctrine of the class struggle, Bazarovallows himself to be caught by the bourgeoisie who sing inchorus “Just so, just so, we are by no means opposed to re-form, we are in favour of the workers participating in coun-try-wide control, we fully agree with that”, and good Bazarov objectively sings the descant for the capitalists. 
 This has always been and always will be the case with people who in the thick of intense class struggle want totake up a “middle” position. 
 And it is because-the writersof Novaya Zhizn are incapable of understanding the class struggle that their policy is such a ridiculous and eternal oscillation between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. 
 Get busy on “plans”, dear citizens, that is not politics, that is not the class struggle; here you may be of use to thepeople. 
 You have many economists on your paper. 
 Unitewith those engineers and others who are willing to work onproblems of regulating production and distribution; devote the centre page of your big “apparatus” (your paper) to a practical study of precise facts on the production and dis-tribution of goods in Russia, on banks, syndicates, etc. 
, etc. 
—that is how you will be of use to the people; that is how your sitting between two stools will not be particularly harmful; such work on “plans” will earn not the ridicule, but the gratitude of the workers. 
 When the proletariat is victorious it will do the follow-ing, it will set economists, engineers, agronomists, and soforth, to work under the control of the workers’ organisations on drawing up a “plan”, on verifying it, on devising labour-saving methods of centralisation, on devising the simplest, cheapest, most convenient and universal measures and meth-ods of control. 
 For this we shall pay the economists, sta-tisticians and technicians good money ... but we shall notgive them anything to eat if they do not perform this workconscientiously and entirely in the interests of the working people. 
 We are in favour of centralism and of a “plan”, but of the centralism and plan of the proletarian state, of proletarian regulation of production and distribution in the interestsof the poor, the working people, the exploited, against the exploiters. 
 We can agree to only one meaning of the term “country-wide”, namely, that which breaks the resistance of the capitalists, which gives all power to the majority ofthe people, i. 
e. 
, the proletarians and semi-proletarians, theworkers and the poor peasants. 
 * * * The fifth plea is that the Bolsheviks will not be able to retain power because “the situation is exceptionally compli-cated”.... 
 O wise men! They, perhaps, would be willing to recon-cile themselves to revolution if only the “situation” were not “exceptionally complicated”. 
 Such revolutions never occur, and sighs for such a rev-olution amount to nothing more than the reactionary wailsof a bourgeois intellectual. 
 Even if a revolution has startedin a situation that seemed to be not very complicated, thedevelopment of the revolution itself always creates an exceptionally complicated situation. 
 A revolution, a real, profound, a “people’s” revolution, to use Marx’s expres-sion, 58 is the incredibly complicated and painful process of the death of the old and birth of the new social order, of the mode of life of tens of millions of people. 
 Revolution is a most intense, furious, desperate class struggle and civil war. 
 Not a single great revolution in history has takenplace without civil war. 
 And only a “man in a muffler” 59 can think that civil war is conceivable without an “excep-tionally complicated situation”. 
 If the situation were not exceptionally complicated there would be no revolution. 
 If you are afraid of wolves don’t go into the forest. 
 There is nothing to discuss in the fifth plea, because there is no economic, political, or any other meaning what-ever in it. 
 It contains only the yearning of people who aredistressed and frightened by the revolution. 
 To characterise this yearning I shall take the liberty of mentioning two little things from my personal experience. 
 I had a conversation with a wealthy engineer shortly before the July days. 
 This engineer had once been a revo-lutionary, had been in the Social-Democratic movement andeven a member of the Bolshevik Party. 
 Now he was full of fear and rage at the turbulent and indomitable workers. 
 “If they were at least like the German workers,” he said(he is an educated man and has been abroad), “of course, Iunderstand that the social revolution is, in general, inevit-able, but here, when the workers’ level has been so reducedby the war ... it is not a revolution, it is an abyss. 
” He was willing to accept the social revolution if history were to lead to it in the peaceful, calm, smooth and precisemanner of a German express train pulling into a station. 
A sedate conductor would open the carriage door and an-nounce: “Social Revolution Station! Alle aussteigen! (All change!)” In that case he would have no objection to chang-ing his position of engineer under the Tit Tityches to that of engineer under the workers’ organisations. 
 That man has seen strikes. 
 He knows what a storm of passion the most ordinary strike arouses even in the mostpeaceful times. 
 He, of course, understands how many mil-lion times more furious this storm must be when the class struggle has aroused all the working people of a vast country, when war and exploitation have driven almost to despera-tion millions of people who for centuries have been torment-ed by the landowners, for decades have been robbed and downtrodden by the capitalists and the tsar’s officials. 
 He understands all this “theoretically”, he only pays lip-service to this, he is simply terrified by the “exceptionally com-plicated situation”. 
 After the July days, thanks to the extremely solicitous attention with which the Kerensky government honouredme, I was obliged to go underground. 
 Of course, it was the workers who sheltered people like us. 
 In a small working-class house in a remote working-class suburb of Petrograd,dinner is being served. 
 The hostess puts bread on the table. 
The host says: “Look what fine bread. 
 ‘They’ dare not giveus bad bread now. 
 And we had almost given up even think-ing that we’d ever get good bread in Petrograd again. 
” I was amazed at this class appraisal of the July days. 
 My thoughts had been revolving around the political signifi-cance of those events, weighing the role they played in thegeneral course of events, analysing the situation that causedthis zigzag in history and the situation it would create,and how we ought to change our slogans and alter our Party apparatus to adapt it to the changed situation. 
 As for bread, I, who had not known want, did not give it a thought. 
I took bread for granted, as a by-product of the writer’swork, as it were. 
 The mind approaches the foundation ofeverything, the class struggle for bread, through political anal-ysis that follows an extremely complicated and devious path. 
 This member of the oppressed class, however, even though one of the well-paid and quite intelligent workers,takes the bull by the horns with that astonishing simplicityand straightforwardness, with that firm determination andamazing clarity of outlook from which we intellectuals are as remote as the stars in the sky. 
 The whole world is divided into two camps: “us”, the working people, and “them”,the exploiters. 
 Not a shadow of embarrassment over whathad taken place; it was just one of the battles in the longstruggle between labour and capital. 
 When you fell trees,chips fly. 
 “What a painful thing is this ‘exceptionally complicated situation’ created by the revolution,” that’s how the bour-geois intellectual thinks and feels. 
 “We squeezed ‘them’ a bit; ‘they’ won’t dare to lord it over us as they did before. 
 We’ll squeeze again—and chuck them out altogether,” that’s how the worker thinks and feels. 
 * * * The sixth and last plea: the proletariat “will be incapable of resisting all the pressure by hostile forces that will sweep away not only the proletarian dictatorship, but the entire revolution into the bargain”. 
 Don’t try to scare us, gentlemen, you won’t succeed. 
 We saw these hostile forces and their pressure in Kornilo-vism (from which the Kerensky regime in no way differs). 
Everybody saw, and the people remember, how the prole-tariat and the poor peasants swept away the Kornilov gang, and how pitiful and helpless proved to be the position ofthe supporters of the bourgeoisie and of the few exception-ally well-to-do local small landowners who were exception-ally “hostile” to the revolution. 
 Dyelo Naroda of Septem-ber 30 urges the workers to “be patient and put up with” Kerensky (i. 
e. 
, Kornilov) and the fake Tsereteli Bulygin Duma until the convocation of the Constituent Assembly(convened under the protection of “military measures”against insurgent peasants!) and, with great gusto, itrepeats precisely Novaya Zhizn ’s sixth plea and shouts until it is hoarse: “The Kerensky government will under no cir-cumstances submit” (to the rule of the Soviets, the rule of the workers and peasants, which Dyelo Naroda , not wishing to lag behind the pogrom-mongers and anti-Semites, monar-chists and Cadets, calls the rule of “Trotsky and Lenin”: theseare the lengths to which the Socialist-Revolutionaries go!). 
 But neither Novaya Zhizn nor Dyelo Naroda can scare the class-conscious workers. 
 “The Kerensky government,” you say, “will under no circumstances submit”, i. 
e. 
, it will repeatthe Kornilov revolt, to put it more simply, bluntly andclearly. 
 And the gentlemen of Dyelo Naroda dare to say that this will be “civil war”, that this is a “horrible prospect”! No, gentlemen, you will not fool the workers. 
 It will not be civil war but a hopeless revolt of a handful of Kor-nilovites. 
 If they want to “refuse to submit” to the peopleand at all costs provoke a repetition on a wide scale of what happened to the Kornilov men in Vyborg— if that is what the Socialist-Revolutionaries want , if that is what the member of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party Kerensky wants, he may drive the people to desperation. 
 But you willnot scare the workers and soldiers with this, gentlemen. 
 What boundless insolence. 
 They faked up a new Bulygin Duma; by means of fraud they recruited a crowd of reaction-ary co-operators and village kulaks to help them, added to these the capitalists and landowners (the so-called property-owning classes) and with the aid of this gang of Kornilovitesthey want to thwart the will of the people , the will of the workers and peasants. 
 They have brought affairs in a peasant country to such a pass that peasant revolt is spreading everywhere like a river in flood! Think of it! In a democratic republic in which 80 per cent of the population are peasants, the peas-ants have been driven to revolt .... 
 This same Dyelo Naroda , Chernov’s newspaper, the organ of the “Socialist-Revolu-tionary” Party, which on September 30 has the effronteryto advise the workers and peasants to “be patient”, was obliged to admit in a leading article on September 29: “So far practically nothing has been done to put an end to those relations of bondage that still prevail in the villages of central Rus-sia. 
” This same Dyelo Naroda , in the same leading article of September 29, says that “the dead hand of Stolypin is stillmaking itself strongly felt” in the methods employed bythe “revolutionary ministers”; in other words, putting it more clearly and simply, it brands Kerensky, Nikitin, Kishkin and Co. 
 as Stolypins . 
 The “Stolypins” Kerensky and Co. 
 have driven the peas-ants to revolt, are now taking “military measures” againstthe peasants, are trying to soothe the people with the convo-cation of the Constituent Assembly (although Kerensky and Tsereteli have already deceived the people once by solemn-ly proclaiming on July 8 that the Constituent Assemblywould be convened on the appointed date, September 17;they then broke their promise and postponed the Constituent Assembly even against the advice of the Menshevik Dan , postponed the Constituent Assembly not to the end of Octo-ber as the Menshevik Central Executive Committee of that time wished, but to the end of November). 
 The “Sto-lypins” Kerensky and Co. 
 are trying to soothe the people with the imminent convocation of the Constituent Assem-bly, as if the people can believe those who have already liedin this matter, as if the people can believe that the Constit-uent Assembly will be properly convened by a government which has taken military measures in remote villages, that is to say, is openly conniving at the arbitrary arrest of class-conscious peasants and the rigging of the elections. 
 The government has driven the peasants to revolt and now has the effrontery to say to them: “You must ‘be patient’,you must wait, trust the government which is pacifying in-surgent peasants by ‘military measures’!” To bring matters to such a pitch that hundreds of thou-sands of Russian soldiers perish in the offensive after June 19, the war is being protracted, German sailors have muti-nied and are throwing their officers overboard, to bringmatters to such a pitch, all the time uttering phrases aboutpeace but not offering a just peace to all the belligerents, and yet to have the effrontery to tell the workers and peasants, to tell the dying soldiers, “you must be patient”, trust the government of the “Stolypin man” Kerensky, trust the Kornilov generals for another month, perhaps in that month they will send several tens of thousands more soldiers to theslaughter.... 
 “You must be patient”.... 
 Isn’t that shameless? But you won’t fool the soldiers, gentlemen of the Socialist-Revolutionaries, Kerensky’s fellow party members. 
 The workers and soldiers will not endure the Keren-sky government for a single day, for an extra hour, for they know that the Soviet Government will immediately offer all the belligerents a just peace and therefore will in all pro-bability achieve an immediate armistice and a speedy peace. 
 Not for a single day, not for an extra hour will the soldiers of our peasant army allow the Kerensky government—thegovernment which is employing military measures to sup-press the peasant revolt—to remain in power against the willof the Soviets. 
 No, gentlemen of the Socialist-Revolutionaries, Keren-sky’s fellow party members, you won’t fool the workers andpeasants any more. 
 * * * On the question of the pressure by hostile forces which the mortally frightened Novaya Zhizn assures us will sweep away the proletarian dictatorship, still another monstrouslogical and political mistake is made, which only peoplewho have allowed themselves to be frightened out of theirwits can fail to see. 
 “Pressure by hostile forces will sweep away the proletari-an dictatorship,” you say. 
 Very well. 
 But you are all econo-mists and educated people, dear fellow-citizens. 
 You allknow that to contrast democracy to the bourgeoisie issenseless and a sign of ignorance; it is the same as contrast-ing pounds to yards, for there is a democratic bourgeoisie and undemocratic groups of the petty bourgeoisie (capable of raising a Vendée). 
 “Hostile forces” is merely an empty phrase. 
 The class term is bourgeoisie (backed by the landowners). 
 The bourgeoisie and the landowners, the proletariat, and the petty bourgeoisie, the small proprietors, primarily the peasants—these are the three main “forces” into which Russia, like every capitalist country, is divided. 
 These are the three main “forces” that have long been revealed inevery capitalist country (including Russia) not only by scien-tific economic analysis, but also by the political experience of the modern history of all countries, by the experience of all European revolutions since the eighteenth century, by the experience of the two Russian revolutions of 1905 and 1917. 
 So, you threaten the proletariat with the prospect that its rule will be swept away by the pressure of the bourgeoi-sie? That, and that alone, is what your threat amounts to, ithas no other meaning. 
 Very well. 
 If, for example, the bourgeoisie can sweep away the rule of the workers and poor peasants, then theonly alternative is a “coalition”, i. 
e. 
, an alliance, or agree-ment, between the petty bourgeoisie and the bourgeoisie. 
Nothing else can be contemplated! But coalition has been tried for about six months and it has led to bankruptcy, and you yourselves, my dear but dense citizens of Novaya Zhizn , have renounced coalition. 
 So what do we get? You have become so muddled, citizens of Novaya Zhizn , you have allowed yourselves to be so scared, that you cannot think straight in the extremely simple matter of counting even up to three , let alone up to five . 
 Either all power to the bourgeoisie—the slogan you have long ceased to advocate, and which the bourgeoisie them-selves dare not even hint at, for they know that the peopleoverthrew this power with one hitch of the shoulder at the time of the April 20-21 events, and would overthrow it now with thrice that determination and ruthlessness; or powerto the petty bourgeoisie, i. 
e. 
, a coalition (alliance, agree-ment) between them and the bourgeoisie, for the pettybourgeoisie do not wish to and cannot take power alone and independently, as has been proved by the experience of all revolutions, and as is proved by economics, which explains that in a capitalist country it is possible to stand for capi-tal and it is possible to stand for labour, but it is impossibleto stand for long in between. 
 In Russia this coalition hasfor six months tried scores of ways and failed. 
 Or, finally, all power to the proletarians and the poor peasants against the bourgeoisie in order to break their resistance. 
 This has not yet been tried, and you, gentlemenof Novaya Zhizn , are dissuading the people from this, you are trying to frighten them with your own fear of the bour-geoisie. 
 No fourth way can be invented. 
 If Novaya Zhizn , therefore, is afraid of the proletarian dictatorship and rejects it because, as it claims, the pro-letarian power may be defeated by the bourgeoisie, it istantamount to its surreptitiously reverting to the position of compromise with the capitalists! It is as clear as daylight, that whoever is afraid of resistance, whoever does not believe that it is possible to break this resistance, whoever warns the people: “beware of the resistance of the capital-ists, you will not be able to cope with it”, is thereby again calling for compromise with the capitalists. 
 Novaya Zhizn is hopelessly and pitifully muddled, as are all the petty-bourgeois democrats who now realise that the coalition is bankrupt, dare not defend it openly and, at the same time, protected by the bourgeoisie, fear thetransfer of all power to the proletarians and poor peasants. 
 * * * To fear the resistance of the capitalists and yet to call oneself a revolutionary, to wish to be regarded as a social-ist—isn’t that disgraceful? How low must internationalsocialism, corrupted by opportunism, have fallen ideologi-cally if such voices could be raised? We have already seen the strength of the capitalists’ resistance; the entire people have seen it, for the capitalists are more class-conscious than the other classes and at oncerealised the significance of the Soviets, at once exerted all their efforts to the utmost, resorted to everything, went to all lengths, resorted to the most incredible lies and slander,to military plots in order to frustrate the Soviets , to reduce them to nought, to prostitute them (with the aid of the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries), to transformthem into talking-shops, to wear down the peasants andworkers by months and months of empty talk and playingat revolution. 
 We have not yet seen , however, the strength of resistance of the proletarians and poor peasants, for this strength will become fully apparent only when power is in the hands ofthe proletariat, when tens of millions of people who havebeen crushed by want and capitalist slavery see from ex-perience and feel that state power has passed into the hands of the oppressed classes, that the state is helping the poor to fight the landowners and capitalists, is breaking their resistance. 
 Only then shall we see what untapped forces of resistance to the capitalists are latent among the people;only then will what Engels called “latent socialism” 60 manifest itself. 
 Only then, for every ten thousand overt and concealed enemies of working-class rule, manifesting them-selves actively or by passive resistance, there will arise a million new fighters who had been politically dormant, writhing in the torments of poverty and despair, havingceased to believe that they were human, that they had theright to live, that they too could be served by the entiremight of the modern centralised state, that contingents of the proletarian militia could, with the fullest confidence, also call upon them to take a direct, immediate, daily part in state administration. 
 The capitalists and landowners, with the kind help of Plekhanov, Breshkovskaya, Tsereteli, Chernov and Co. 
, have done everything in their power to defile the democratic republic, to defile it by servility to wealth to such a degreethat the people are being overcome by apathy, indifference;it is all the same to them , because the hungry man cannot see the difference between the republic and the monarchy;the freezing, barefooted, worn-out soldier sacrificing his life for alien interests is not inclined to love the republic. 
 But when every labourer, every unemployed worker, every cook, every ruined peasant sees, not from the news-papers, but with his own eyes, that the proletarian stateis not cringing to wealth but is helping the poor, that thisstate does not hesitate to adopt revolutionary measures, that it confiscates surplus stocks of provisions from the parasites-and distributes them to the hungry, that it for-cibly installs the homeless in the houses of the rich, thatit compels the rich to pay for milk but does not give them adrop until the children of all poor families are sufficiently supplied, that the land is being transferred to the working people and the factories and banks are being placed under the control of the workers, and that immediate and severepunishment is meted out to the millionaires who concealtheir wealth—when the poor see and feel this, no capitalistor kulak forces, no forces of world finance capital whichmanipulates thousands of millions, will vanquish the people’s revolution; on the contrary, the socialist revolution will triumph all over the world for it is maturing in all countries. 
 Our revolution will be invincible if it is not afraid of itself, if it transfers all power to the proletariat, for behindus stand the immeasurably larger, more developed, moreorganised world forces of the proletariat which are tempo-rarily held down by the war but not destroyed; on the con-trary, the war has multiplied them. 
 * * * How can one be afraid that the Bolshevik government, that is to say, the proletarian government, which is assured of the devoted support of the poor peasants, will be “sweptaway” by the capitalist gentlemen! What shortsightedness! What disgraceful fear of the people! What hypocrisy! Those who show this fear belong to that “high” (by capitalist stan-dards, but actually rotten ) “society” which utters the word “justice” without believing in it, from habit, as a trite phrase,attaching no meaning to it. 
 Here is an example. 
Mr. 
 Peshekhonov is a well-known semi-Cadet. 
 A more moderate Trudovik, one of the same mind as the Breshkov-skayas and Plekhanovs, will not be found. 
 There has never been a minister more servile to the bourgeoisie. 
 The worldhad never seen a more ardent advocate of “coalition”, ofcompromise with the capitalists. 
 Here are the admissions this gentleman-was forced to make in his speech at the “Democratic” (read: Bulygin) Conference as reported by the defencist Izvestia : “There are two programmes. 
 One is the programme of group claims, class and national claims. 
 This programme is most frank-ly advocated by the Bolsheviks. 
 It is not easy, however,for the other sections of the democracy to reject this program-me. 
 They are the claims of the working people, the claims of thecheated and oppressed nationalities. 
 It is not so easy, therefore, for the democracy to break with the Bolsheviks, to reject these class demands, primarily because in essence these demands are just. 
 Butthis programme, for which we fought before the revolution, for thesake of which we made the revolution, and which we would all un-animously support under other circumstances, constitutes a verygrave danger under present conditions. 
 The danger is all the greater now because these demands have to be presented at a time when it is impossible for the state to comply with them. 
 We must first defendthe whole—the state, to save it from doom, and there is only one wayto do that, not the satisfaction of demands, however just and cogentthey may be, but, on the contrary, restriction and sacrifice, whichmust be contributed from all quarters. 
 ( Izvestia , September 17. 
) Mr. 
 Peshekhonov fails to understand that as long as the capitalists are in power he is defending not the whole, but the selfish interests of Russian and “Allied” imperial-ist capital. 
 Mr. 
 Peshekhonov fails to understand that thewar would cease to be an imperialist, predatory war of annex-ation only after a rupture with the capitalists, with their secret treaties, with their annexations (seizure of alien territory), with their banking and financial swindles. 
 Mr. 
 Peshekhonov fails to understand that only after this would the war become—if the enemy rejected the formal offer of a just peace—a defensive war, a just war. 
 Mr. 
 Peshekhonov fails to understand that the defence potential of a country that has thrown off the yoke of capital, that has given the peasants land and has placed the banks and factories underworkers’ control, would be many times greater than thedefence potential of a capitalist country. 
 The main thing that. 
 Mr. 
 Peshekhonov fails to understand is that he surrenders his entire position, the entire position of the entire petty-bourgeois democracy when he is forced to admit the justice of Bolshevism, to admit that its de-mands are the demands of the “working people”, i. 
e. 
, of themajority of the people. 
 This is where our strength lies. 
 This is why our govern-ment will be invincible; because even our opponents are forced to admit that the Bolshevik programme is that of the “working people” and the “oppressed nationalities”. 
 After all, Mr. 
 Peshekhonov is the political friend of the Cadets, of the Yedinstvo and Dyelo Naroda people, ofthe Breshkovskayas and Plekhanovs, he is the representativeof the kulaks and of the gentlemen whose wives and sisters would come tomorrow to gouge out with their umbrellas the eyes of wounded Bolsheviks if they were to be defeatedby Kornilov’s or (which is the same thing) Kerensky’stroops. 
 A gentleman like that is forced to admit the “justice” of the Bolshevik demands. 
 For him “justice” is merely an empty phrase. 
 For the mass of semi-proletarians, however, and for the majority of theurban and rural petty bourgeoisie who have been ruined,tortured and worn out by the war, it is not an emptyphrase, but a most acute, most burning and immensequestion of death from starvation, of a crust of bread. 
 That is why no policy can be based on a “coalition”, on a “com-promise” between the interests of the starving and ruinedand the interests of the exploiters. 
 That is why the Bolshe-vik government is assured of the support of the overwhelm-ing majority of these people. 
 Justice is an empty word, say the intellectuals and those rascals who are inclined to proclaim themselves Marxists on the lofty grounds that they have “contemplated thehind parts” of economic materialism. 
 Ideas become a power when they grip the people. 
 And precisely at the present time the Bolsheviks, i. 
e. 
, the representatives of revolutionary proletarian international-ism, have embodied in their policy the idea that is moti-vating countless working people all over the world. 
 Justice alone, the mere anger of the people against ex-ploitation, would never have brought them on to the truepath of socialism. 
 But now that, thanks to capitalism, the material apparatus of the big banks, syndicates, railways, and so forth, has grown, now that the immense experience ofthe advanced countries has accumulated a stock of engineer-ing marvels, the employment of which is being hindered by capitalism, now that the class-conscious workers have builtup a party of a quarter of a million members to systematical-ly lay hold of this apparatus and set it in motion with the support of all the working and exploited people—now thatthese conditions exist, no power on earth can prevent theBolsheviks, if they do not allow themselves to be scared and if they succeed in taking power, from retaining it until thetriumph of the world socialist revolution. 
 AFTERWORD The foregoing lines were already written when the lead-ing article in Novaya Zhizn of October 1 produced another gem of stupidity which is all the more dangerous because it professes sympathy with the Bolsheviks and offers mostsagacious philistine admonitions “not to allow yourselves tobe provoked” (not to allow ourselves to be caught in thetrap of screams about provocation, the object of which isto frighten the Bolsheviks and cause them to refrain from taking power). 
 Here is this gem: “The lessons of movements, like that of July 3 -5, on the one hand, and of the Kornilov days, on the other, have shown quite clearlythat the democracy, having at its command organs that exercise im-mense influence among the population, is invincible when it takesa defensive position in civil war, and that it suffers defeat, loses allthe middle vacillating groups when it takes the initiative and launches an offensive. 
” If the Bolsheviks were to yield in any form and in the slightest degree to the philistine stupidity of this argumentthey would ruin their Party and the revolution. 
 For the author of this argument, taking it upon himself to talk about civil war (just the subject for a lady withmany good points), has distorted the lessons of history on this question in an incredibly comical manner. 
 This is how these lessons, the lessons of history on this question, were treated by the representative and founder of proletarian revolutionary tactics, Karl Marx: “Now, insurrection is an art quite as much as war or any other art, and is subject to certain procedural rules which, when neglected, will bring about the downfall of the party neglecting them. 
 These rules, logical deductions from the nature of the parties and the circumstances you have to deal with in such a case, are so plain and simple that thebrief experience of 1848 made the Germans fairly wellacquainted with them. 
 Firstly, never play with insurrectionunless you are fully prepared to go the whole way [literally:face the consequences of your game]. 
 * “Insurrection is an equation with very indefinite magnitudes, the value of which may change every day; the forces opposed to youhave all the advantage of organisation, discipline and habit-ual authority [Marx has in mind the most “difficult” caseof insurrection: against the “firmly established” old author-ity, against the army not yet disintegrated by the influence of the revolution and the vacillation of the government]; un-less you bring strong odds against them you are defeated andruined. 
 Secondly, once you have entered upon the insurrec-tionary career, act with the greatest determination, andon the offensive. 
 The defensive is the death of every armedrising; it is lost before it measures itself with its enemies. 
 Surprise your antagonists while their forces are scattered, prepare the way for new successes, however small, but pre-pare daily; keep up the moral superiority which the firstsuccessful rising has given to you; rally in this way thosevacillating elements to your side which always follow thestrongest impulse and which always look out for the safer side; force your enemies to retreat before they can collect their strength against you; in the words of Danton, the grea-test master of revolutionary tactics yet known: de l ’audace , de l ’audace , encore de l ’audace! ” (Revolution and Counter-revolution in Germany , German edition, 1907, p. 
 118). 
 We have changed all that, the “would-be Marxists” of No-vaya Zhizn may say about themselves; instead of triple audac-ity they have two virtues: “We have two, sir: moderationand accuracy. 
” 61 For “us”, the experience of world history, the experience of the Great French Revolution, is nothing. 
The important thing for “us” is the experience of the twomovements in 1917, distorted by Molchalin spectacles. 
 *Interpolations in square brackets (within passages quoted by Lenin) have been introduced by Lenin unless otherwise indicated. 
— Ed. 
 Let us examine this experience without these charming spectacles. 
 You compare July 3-5 with “civil war”, because you be-lieved Alexinsky, Pereverzev and Co. 
 It is typical of thegentlemen of Novaya Zhizn that they believe such people (and do absolutely nothing themselves to collect information about July 3-5, although they have the huge apparatus of abig daily newspaper at their disposal). 
 Let us assume for a moment, however, that July 3-5 was not the rudiment of civil war that was kept within therudimentary stage by the Bolsheviks, but actual civil war. 
Let us assume this. 
 In that case, then, what does this lesson prove?First, the Bolsheviks did not take the offensive, for it is indisputable that on the night of July 3-4, and even on July 4, they would have gained a great deal if they had takenthe offensive. 
 Their defensive position was their weakness,if we are to speak of civil war (as Novaya Zhizn does, and not of converting a spontaneous outburst into a demonstra-tion of the type of April 20-21, as the facts show). 
 The “lesson” therefore proves that the wise men of Novaya Zhizn are wrong . 
 Secondly, if the Bolsheviks did not even set out to start an insurrection on July 3 or 4, if not a single Bolshevik body even raised such a question, the reason for it lies beyond the scope of our controversy with Novaya Zhizn . 
 For we are arguing about the lessons of “civil war”, i. 
e. 
, of insurrection, and not about the point that obvious lack of a majority tosupport it restrains the revolutionary party from thinkingof insurrection. 
 Since everybody knows that the Bolsheviks received a majority in the metropolitan Soviets and in the country (over 49 per cent of the Moscow votes) much later than July 1917, it again follows that the “lessons” are far, far fromwhat Novaya Zhizn , that lady with many good points, would like them to be. 
 No, no, you had better not meddle with politics, citi-zens of Novaya Zhizn ! If the revolutionary party has no majority in the advanced contingents of the revolutionary classes and in the country,insurrection is out of the question. 
 Moreover, insurrection requires: (1) growth of the revolution on a country-wide scale; (2) the complete moral and political bankruptcy of the old government, for example, the “coalition” govern-ment; (3) extreme vacillation in the camp of all middlegroups, i. 
e. 
, those who do not fully support the government, although they did fully support it yesterday. 
 Why did Novaya Zhizn , when speaking of the “lessons” of July 3-5, fail even to note this very important lesson? Because a political question was not dealt with by politi-cians but by a circle of intellectuals who had been terrifiedby the bourgeoisie. 
 To proceed. 
 Thirdly, the facts show that it was after July 3-4 that the rot set in among the Socialist-Revolution-aries and Mensheviks, precisely because the Tseretelis had exposed themselves by their July policy, precisely because the mass of the people realised that the Bolsheviks were their own front-rank fighters and that the “social-bloc” advocates were traitors. 
 Even before the Kornilov revolt this rot was fully revealed by the Petrograd elections onAugust 20, which resulted in a victory for the Bolsheviks and the rout of the “social-bloc” advocates ( Dyelo Naroda recently tried to refute this by concealing the returns for all parties, but this was both self-deception and deception of its readers; according to the figures published in Dyen of August 24, covering only the city, the Cadets’ share ofthe total vote increased from 22 to 23 per cent, but the absolute number of votes cast for the Cadets dropped 40 per cent; the Bolsheviks’ share of the total vote increased from20 to 33 per cent, while the absolute number of votes castfor the Bolsheviks dropped only 10 per cent; the share of all“middle groups” dropped from 58 to 44 per cent, but theabsolute number of votes cast for them dropped 60 per cent!). 
 That a rot had set in among the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks after the July days and before the Kor-nilov days is also proved by the growth of the Left wings inboth parties, reaching almost 40 per cent: this is “retribu-tion” for the persecution of the Bolsheviks by the Kerenskys. 
 In spite of the “loss” of a few hundred members, the proletarian party gained enormously from July 3-4, for it was precisely during those stern days that the people real-ised and saw its devotion and the treachery of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks. 
 So, the “lesson” is far, very far from being of the Novaya Zhizn sort, it is one entirely different, namely: don’t desert the seething massesfor the “Molchalins of democracy”; and if you launch aninsurrection, go over to the offensive while the enemy forcesare scattered, catch the enemy unawares. 
 Is that not so, gentlemen “would-be Marxists” of Novaya Zhizn ? Or does “Marxism” mean not basing tactics on an exact appraisal of the objective situation but senselessly and un-critically lumping together “civil war” and “a Congress ofSoviets and the convocation of the Constituent Assembly”? But this is simply ridiculous, gentlemen, this is a sheer mockery of Marxism and of logic in general! If there is nothing in the objective situation that warrants the intensification of the class struggle to the point of “civilwar”, why did you speak of “civil war” in connection with “a Congress of Soviets and the Constituent Assembly”?(For this is the title of the leading article in Novaya Zhizn here under discussion. 
) In that case you should clearly have told the reader and proved to him that there is no ground in the objective situation for civil war and that, therefore,peaceful, constitutionally-legal, juridically and parliamen-tarily “simple” things like a Congress of Soviets and a Con-stituent Assembly can and should be the cornerstone of tactics. 
 In that case it is possible to hold the opinion that such a congress and such an assembly are really capableof making decisions . 
 If, however, the present objective conditions harbour the inevitability or even only the probability of civil war,if you did not “idly” speak about it, but did so clearly seeing, feeling, sensing the existence of a situation of civil war, how could you make a Congress of Soviets or a ConstituentAssembly the cornerstone? This is a sheer mockery of thestarving and tormented people! Do you think the starvingwill consent to “wait” two months? Or that the ruin, aboutthe increase of which you yourselves write every day, will consent to “wait” for the Congress of Soviets or for the Constituent Assembly? Or that the German offensive, in theabsence of serious steps on our part towards peace (i. 
e. 
, in the absence of a formal offer of a just peace to all belligerents), will consent to “wait” for the Congress of Soviets or for the Constituent Assembly? Or are you in possession of facts which permit you to conclude that the history of the Rus-sian revolution, which from February 28 to September 30had proceeded with extraordinary turbulence and unprece-dented rapidity, will, from October 1 to November 29, 62 proceed at a super-tranquil, peaceful, legally balanced pace that will preclude upheavals, spurts, military defeats and economic crises? Or will the army at the front, concerningwhich the non-Bolshevik officer Dubasov said officially, in the name of the front, “it will not fight”, quietly starveand freeze until the “appointed” date? Or will the peasantrevolt cease to be a factor of civil war because you call it “anarchy” and “pogrom”, or because Kerensky will send “military” forces against the peasants ? Or is it possible, conceivable , that the government can work calmly, honestly, and without deception to convene the Constituent Assembly in a peasant country when that same government is suppress-ing the peasant revolt? Don’t laugh at the “confusion in the Smolny Institute”, 63 gentlemen! There is no less confusion in your own ranks. 
 You answer the formidable questions of civil war with con-fused phrases and pitiful constitutional illusions. 
 That iswhy I say that if the Bolsheviks were to give in to thesemoods they would ruin both their Party and their revolu-tion. 
 October 1, 1917. 
 N. 
 Lenin TO WORKERS, PEASANTS, AND SOLDIERS! Comrades! The Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries, to which Kerensky belongs, appeals to you in its paper Dyelo Naroda (of September 30) “ to be patient ”. 
 The paper asks us “to be patient” and urges that power be left in the hands of Kerensky’s government, that powershould not pass to the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’Deputies. 
 Let Kerensky rely on the landowners, capital-ists and kulaks, let the Soviets that have carried through the revolution and vanquished the Kornilovite generals “be patient”, we are told. 
 Let them have patience until theConstituent Assembly, which will soon be convened. 
 Comrades! Look around you, see what is happening in the countryside, see what is happening in the army, andyou will realise that the peasants and the soldiers cannot tolerate it any longer. 
 An uprising of the peasants from whom the land has hitherto been withheld by fraud is sweep-ing like a broad river over the whole of Russia. 
 The peasantscannot tolerate it any longer. 
 Kerensky sends troops to sup-press the peasants and to defend the landowners. 
 Kerenskyhas again come to an agreement with the Kornilovite gener-als and officers who stand for the landowners. 
 Neither the workers in the cities nor the soldiers at the front can tolerate this military suppression of the juststruggle of the peasants for the land. 
 As to what is going on in the army at the front, Dubasov, a non-Party officer, has declared before all of Russia: “The soldiers will not fight any longer. 
” The soldiers are tired out, the soldiers are barefooted, the soldiers are starving, thesoldiers do not want to fight for the interests of the capital-ists, they do not want to “ be patient ” when they are treated only to beautiful words about peace, while for months there has been a delay (as Kerensky is delaying it) in the peace pro-posal , the proposal for a just peace without annexations, to be offered to all the belligerent peoples. 
 Comrades! Know that Kerensky is again negotiating with the Kornilovite generals and officers to lead troops against the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies, to prevent the Soviets from obtaining power ! Kerensky “ will under no circumstances submit ” to the Soviets, Dyelo Naroda openly admits. 
 Go, then, to the barracks, go to the Cossack units, go to the working people and explain the truth to them. 
 If power is in the hands of the Soviets, then not later than October 25 (if the Congress of Soviets opens on October 20) a just peace will be offered to all the belligerent peoples. 
 There will be a workers ’ and peasants ’ government in Russia; it will immediately , without losing a single day, offer a just peace to all the belligerent peoples . 
 Then the people will learn who wants the unjust war. 
 Then in the Constituent Assembly the people will decide. 
 If power is in the hands of the Soviets, the landowners ’ estates will immediately be declared the inalienable property of the whole people . 
 This is what Kerensky and his government fight against, relying on the village exploiters, capitalists and landowners! This is for whom and for whose interests you are asked to “be patient”. 
 Are you willing to “be patient” in order that Kerensky may use armed force to suppress the peasants who have risenfor land? Are you willing to “be patient” in order that the war may be dragged out longer, in order that the offer of peace and the annulling of the former tsar’s secret treaties with theRussian and Anglo-French capitalists may be postponed? Comrades, remember that Kerensky deceived the people once when he promised to convene the Constituent Assem-bly! On July 8 he solemnly promised to convene it not later than September 17, and he has deceived the people . 
 Comrades! Whoever believes in the Kerensky government is a traitorto his brothers, the peasants and soldiers! No, not for one more day are the people willing to suffer postponement . 
 Not for a single day longer can we suffer the peasants to be suppressed by armed force, thousands upon thousands to perish in the war, when a just peace can and must be offered at once. 
 Down with the government of Kerensky , who is conniving with the Kornilovite landowning generals to suppress thepeasants, to fire on the peasants, to drag out the war! All power to the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies! Written October 1-2 (14-15), 1917 First published in Pravda No. 
 93 Published according April 23, 1924 to the manuscript LETTE R TO THE CENTRA L COMMITTEE, THE MOSCO W AND PETROGRAD COMMITTEE S AND THE BOLSHEVI K MEMBERS OF THE PETROGRA D AND MOSCO W SOVIET S64 Dear Comrades, Events are prescribing our task so clearly for us that procrastination is becoming positively criminal. 
 The peasant movement is developing. 
 The government is intensifying its severe repressive measures. 
 Sympathy for us is growing in the army (99 per cent of the soldiers’votes were cast for us in Moscow, the army in Finland and the fleet are against the government, and there is Dubasov’s evidence about the front in general). 
 In Germany the beginning of a revolution is obvious, especially since the sailors were shot. 
 The elections in Mos-cow—47 per cent Bolsheviks—are a tremendous victory. 
Together with the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries we have an obvious majority in the country. 
 The railway and postal employees are in conflict with the government. 
 Instead of calling the Congress for October 20, the Lieberdans are already talking of calling it at theend of October, etc. 
, etc. 
 Under such circumstances to “wait” would be a crime. 
 The Bolsheviks have no right to wait for the Congress of Soviets, they must take power at once. 
 By so doing they will save the world revolution (for otherwise there is danger of a deal between the imperialists of all countries, who,after the shootings in Germany, will be more accommodat-ing to each other and will unite against us ), the Russian rev-olution (otherwise a wave of real anarchy may becomestronger than we are ) and the lives of hundreds of thousands of people at the front. 
 Delay is criminal. 
 To wait for the Congress of Soviets would be a childish game of formalities, a disgraceful game of formalities, and a betrayal of the revolution. 
 If power cannot be achieved without insurrection, we must resort to insurrection at once. 
 It may very well be that right now power can be achieved without insurrection, for exam-ple, if the Moscow Soviet were to take power at once, imme-diately, and proclaim itself (together with the Petrograd Soviet) the government. 
 Victory in Moscow is guaranteed, and there is no need to fight. 
 Petrograd can wait. 
 The govern-ment cannot do anything to save itself; it will surrender. 
 For, by seizing power and taking over the banks, the factories and Russkoye Slovo , the Moscow Soviet would secure a tremendous basis and tremendous strength, it would be able to campaign throughout Russia and raise the issue thus: we shall propose peace tomorrow if the Bonapartist Kerensky surrenders (and if he does not, we shall overthrowhim). 
 We shall hand over the land to the peasants at once , we shall make concessions to the railway and postal employ-ees at once , and so on. 
 It is not necessary to “begin” with Petrograd. 
 If Moscow “begins” without any blood being shed, it will certainly besupported by (1) the army at the front by its sympathy, (2)the peasants everywhere and (3) the fleet and the troops inFinland, which will proceed to Petrograd . 
 Even if Kerensky has a corps or two of mounted troops near Petrograd, he will be obliged to surrender. 
 The Petro-grad Soviet can wait and campaign for the Moscow SovietGovernment. 
 The slogan is: Power to the Soviets, Land tothe Peasants, Peace to the Nations, Bread to the Starving! Victory is certain, and the chances are ten to one that it will be a bloodless victory. 
 To wait would be a crime to the revolution.

 XIV, Part 2 THESES FOR A REPORT AT THE OCTOBE R 8 CONFERENCE OF THE PETROGRA D ORGANISATION, ALS O FOR A RESOLUTIO N AND INSTRUCTIONS TO THOS E ELECTE D TO THE PART Y CONGRES S65 ON THE QUESTION OF THE PARTY’S PARTICIPATION IN THE PRE -PARLIAMENT 1. 
 The participation of our Party in the Pre-parliament, in the Democratic Council, or in the Council of the Republic is an obvious error and a deviation from the proletarian revo-lutionary path. 
 2. 
 The objective situation is such that a revolution against Kerensky’s Bonapartist government is undoubtedlyfomenting in the country (peasant uprising, increasingdissatisfaction and conflicts with the government in the army and among non-Russian groups, conflict with railway and postal employees, the resounding defeat of the Men-shevik and Socialist-Revolutionary conciliators at the elec-tions, etc. 
). 
 At a time when there is such an upsurge of the revolution, to go to a sham parliament decked out to deceive the people is to facilitate this deception, make the preparation for the revolution more difficult , and distract the attention of the people and the forces of the Party from the urgent task ofthe struggle for power and for the overthrow of the govern-ment. 
 3. 
 The Party congress, therefore, must recall Party mem-bers from the Pre-parliament, declare a boycott of it, appealto the people to prepare forces for dispersing this “BulyginDuma” of Tsereteli ’s. 
 ON THE SLOGAN “ALL POWER TO THE SOVIETS” 1. 
 All the six months’ work of the Bolsheviks in the revolution, all the criticism levelled by them against theMensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries for their “con-ciliationism” and for their having turned the Soviets intotalking-shops, demand on the part of the Bolsheviks a loyaladherence to this slogan in a straightforward Marxist way. 
 Unfortunately, vacillations are to be noted at the top levels of our Party, a “fear”, as it were, of the struggle forpower, a tendency to substitute resolutions, protests, andcongresses for this struggle. 
 2. 
 All the experience of both revolutions, that of 1905 and that of 1917, and all the decisions of the Bolshevik Party, all its political declarations for many years, may be reduced to the concept that the Soviet of Workers’ and Sol-diers’ Deputies is a reality only as an organ of insurrection,as an organ of revolutionary power. 
 Apart from this, theSoviets are a meaningless plaything that can only produceapathy, indifference and disillusion among the masses, who are legitimately disgusted at the endless repetition of reso-lutions and protests. 
 3. 
 Particularly today, when a peasant uprising is sweeping the country and is being suppressed by Kerensky with theaid of picked troops, when even the military measuresin the rural areas constitute an obvious threat that the elec-tions to the Constituent Assembly will be rigged, when even in Germany there has been a mutiny in the fleet, arefusal on the part of the Bolsheviks to transform the Sovietsinto organs of insurrection would be a betrayal both of thepeasants and of the cause of the world socialist revolution. 
 4. 
 The problem of the seizure of power by the Soviets is that of a successful uprising. 
 That is why all the best forces of the Party must be sent to the factories and barracks toexplain to the masses their task and, taking their moodcorrectly in account, choose the proper moment for over-throwing the Kerensky government. 
 To insist on connecting this task with the Congress of Soviets, to subordinate it to this Congress, means to be merely playing at insurrection by setting a definite date beforehand, by making it easier for the government to prepare troops, by confusing the masses with the illusion that a “resolution” of the Congress of Soviets can solve a task which only the insurrectionary proletariat is capable of solving by force. 
 5. 
 It is necessary to fight against constitutional illusions and hopes placed in the Congress of Soviets, to discard thepreconceived idea that we absolutely must “wait” for it, toconcentrate all efforts on explaining to the masses the inev-itability of an uprising, and on preparing it. 
 With the Soviets of both capital cities in their hands the Bolshevikswould be reducing all their propaganda for the Power-to-the-Soviets slogan to empty phrases and, politically, wouldbe covering themselves with shame as a party of the revolu-tionary proletariat if they refused to carry out this task, and if they became reconciled to the convocation of the Con-stituent Assembly (which means a faked Constituent Assem-bly) by the Kerensky government. 
 6. 
 This is particularly true now, when the Moscow elec-tions have given the Bolsheviks 49. 
5 per cent of the votesand when the Bolsheviks, with the support of the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, which has long existed in reality, have an undoubted majority in the country. 
 NOTE TO THE RESOLUTION ON POWER TO THE SOVIETS Not everything in the Theses on Power to the Soviets should be published, but it is tantamount to the Party’s losing its connections with the vanguard of the proletariat,if we refuse to discuss within the Party and to make clearto the masses those most urgent and important problemsthat cannot be discussed in the open due to the absence offull freedom of the press, or that cannot be brought out openly before the enemy.

 XIV, Part 2 LETTER TO THE PETROGRAD CITY CONFERENCE TO BE READ IN CLOSED SESSION Comrades, Permit me to call the attention of the Conference to the extreme seriousness of the political situation. 
 I base myopinion on the news in the Saturday morning papers alone. 
That news, however, compels me to raise the question inthis way. 
 The absolute inaction of the British fleet in general, and also of British submarines during the occupation of Esel by the Germans, coupled with the government’s planto move from Petrograd to Moscow—does not all this provethat the Russian and British imperialists, Kerensky and theAnglo-French capitalists, have conspired to surrender Pet-rograd to the Germans and thus stifle the Russian revo-lution? I think it does. 
Perhaps there was no direct conspiracy, but an agreement reached through some Kornilovites (Maklakov or otherCadets, “non-party” Russian millionaires, etc. 
), but thisdoes not in any way change the nature of it. 
 The conclusion is clear. 
 We must admit that unless the Kerensky government is overthrown by the proletariat and the soldiers in the nearfuture the revolution is ruined. 
 The question of an uprisingis on the order of the day. 
 We must mobilise all forces to convince the workers and soldiers that it is absolutely imperative to wage a last, desperate and decisive fight for the overthrow of the Keren-sky government. 
 We must appeal to the Moscow comrades, persuade them to seize power in Moscow, declare the Kerensky government deposed, and declare the Soviet of Workers’ Deputies in Moscow the provisional government of Russia in order tooffer immediate peace and save Russia from the conspiracy. 
Let the Moscow comrades raise the question of the uprisingin Moscow immediately. 
 We must use the opportunity offered by the Congress of the Soviets of Soldiers’ Deputies of the Northern Region, 66 called for October 8 in Helsingfors, and mobilise all our forces to win the delegates over for the uprising (as they goback through Petrograd). 
 We must put the request and proposal to the Central Com-mittee of our Party that it hasten the withdrawal of the Bolsheviks from the Pre-parliament and devote all efforts to exposing to the masses Kerensky’s conspiracy with theimperialists of other countries and to preparing the uprisingso that the right moment for it is chosen. 
 P. 
S. 
 The resolution of the soldiers ’ section of the Petro-grad Soviet against moving the government from Petro-grad 67 shows that the soldiers are also becoming more con-vinced of Kerensky’s conspiracy. 
 We must gather all forcesto support this correct conviction and to carry on propaganda among the soldiers. 
 * * * I move that the following resolution be adopted: “The Conference, having discussed the present situation, which is generally admitted to be highly critical, establishesthe following facts: “1. 
 The aggressive operations of the German fleet, accom-panied by the very strange inactivity of the British fleet and coupled with the Provisional Government’s plan to move from Petrograd to Moscow, arouse a very strong sus-picion that the government of Kerensky (or, what is the samething, the Russian imperialists behind him) have enteredinto a conspiracy with the Anglo-French imperialists to sur-render Petrograd to the Germans and in this way to suppress the revolution. 
 “2. 
 These suspicions are greatly strengthened, and are being confirmed, as far as is possible in such cases, by the following: “First, the conviction has long been growing and strength-ening in the army that it was betrayed by the tsarist generals and is also being betrayed by the generals of Kornilov and Kerensky (particularly in the surrender ofRiga); “Second, the Anglo-French bourgeois press does not con-ceal its fierce, even frenzied hatred for the Soviets and itsreadiness to drown them in any quantity of blood; “Third, Kerensky, the Cadets, Breshkovskaya, Plekhanov and similar politicians are conscious or unconscious toolsin the hands of Anglo-French imperialism, as six months’history of the Russian revolution has proved in full; “Fourth, the vague but persistent rumours of a separate peace between Britain and Germany ‘at the expense of Russia’ could not have arisen without cause; “Fifth, all the circumstances of the Kornilov conspiracy, as admitted even by Dyelo Naroda and Izvestia , papers that on the whole sympathise with Kerensky, have provedthat Kerensky was to a very large extent mixed up in theKornilov affair, that Kerensky was and is the most danger-ous Kornilovite; Kerensky, in fact, has shielded such lead-ers of the Kornilov revolt as Rodzyanko, Klembovsky,Maklakov, and others. 
 “The Conference, therefore, recognises that all the shout-ing by Kerensky and the bourgeois papers that supporthim about the defence of Petrograd is sheer deception and hypocrisy, and the soldiers’ section of the Petrograd Soviet was perfectly right when it sharply condemned the plan tomove from Petrograd; furthermore, that Petrograd cannotbe defended and the revolution saved unless the tired armyis absolutely and urgently convinced of the sincerity of thegovernment and is given bread, clothing and footwear at the cost of revolutionary measures against the capitalists, who hitherto have sabotaged the struggle against economicruin (as admitted even by the Economic Department of theMenshevik-Socialist-Revolutionary Central Executive Com-mittee). 
 “The Conference therefore declares that only the overthrow of the Kerensky government with its packed Council of the Republic, and the substitution for it of a workers’ andpeasants revolutionary government, can ensure: “(a) the transfer of the land to the peasants instead of suppressing the peasant uprising; “(b) the offer of an immediate and just peace so that our entire army will believe that truth exists; “(c) adoption of the most decisive revolutionary measures against the capitalists in order to provide the army withbread, clothing and footwear and in order to fight againsteconomic ruin. 
 “The Conference urgently requests the Central Committee to take all measures to lead the inevitable uprising of theworkers, soldiers and peasants for the overthrow of the anti-popular, feudal Kerensky government. 
 “The Conference decides on the immediate dispatch of delegations to Helsingfors, Vyborg, Kronstadt and Revel, to the military units south of Petrograd, and also to Moscow, to carry on propaganda in favour of adopting this resolutionand in favour of a swift, general uprising and the overthrowof Kerensky as the steps necessary to open the road to peace,to save Petrograd and the revolution, and to give the landto the peasants and power to the Soviets.

 Lenin The extraordinary congress of the Party, the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks), called by the Central Committee for October 17, has on the agenda the revision of the Party programme. 
 The Conference of April24-29 68 passed a resolution on the necessity for such a revision and indicated in eight points the direction whichthis revision should follow. 
 * Then, later, pamphlets were published in Petrograd ** and Moscow, *** which took up the question of revision, and on August 10 the Moscow journal Spartak69 No.

 Bukharin devoted to the same subject. 
 Let us examine the points raised by the Moscow comrades. 
 I For the Bolsheviks, who all agree on the need to “evaluate imperialism and the epoch of imperialist wars in connectionwith the approaching socialist revolution” (Clause 1 of theresolution adopted by the Conference of April 24-29), themain question in the revision of the Party programme is that of formulating a new programme. 
 Should we round out the old programme by adding a characterisation of imperi-*See present edition, Vol.

 alism (I advocated this opinion in the Petrograd pamphlet), or should we change the whole text of the old programme? (This opinion was expressed by the group which was formed at the April Conference, and is now being advocated by theMoscow comrades. 
) This is primarily the question confront-ing our Party. 
 We have two drafts. 
 The one I proposed complements the old programme by adding a characterisation of imperial-ism *; the second, proposed by Comrade V. 
 Sokolnikov, and based on the remarks of a committee of three (this commit-tee was elected by the group formed at the April Conference),changes the entire general part of the programme. 
 I also had occasion to express my opinion (in the above-mentioned pamphlet, p. 
 11 **) concerning the theoretical incorrectness of the plan of revision indicated by the group. 
Let us see now how this plan is carried out in Comrade So-kolnikov’s draft. 
 Comrade Sokolnikov has divided the general part of our programme into ten sections, giving each a number (seepp. 
 11-18 of the Moscow pamphlet). 
 We will adhere to his numerical scheme so as to enable the reader to find the rele-vant passages. 
 The first section of the present programme consists of two clauses. 
 The first declares that the labour movementhas become international because of the development ofexchange; the second, that the Russian Social-Democratic Party considers itself one of the contingents of the army of the world proletariat. 
 (Further on in the second section thecommon ultimate aim of all Social-Democrats is mentioned. 
) Comrade Sokolnikov leaves the second clause intact, while he replaces the first by a new one, adding to the pointabout the development of exchange an allusion to the “export of capital” and the growth of the struggle of the proletariat into “a world-wide socialist revolution”. 
 The immediate result is inconsistency, a mixture of subjects, a confusion of two types of programme structure. 
 One of the two: either we must begin with the character-isation of imperialism as a whole —and in that case we must * -**Ibid.

 /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR not single out only the “export of capital”, or leave in, as Comrade Sokolnikov does, the analysis of “the process of development” of bourgeois society in the second section; or we must leave the type of programme structure unchanged,i. 
e. 
, first explain why our movement has become internation-al, what its common ultimate goal is, how the “process ofdevelopment” of bourgeois society is leading to this goal. 
 To make the inconsistency and lack of logic in Comrade Sokolnikov’s formulation of the programme more evident, we will quote in full the opening sentences of the old pro-gramme: “The development of exchange has established such close ties between all the nations of the civilised world that thegreat movement of the proletariat towards emancipation was bound to become—and has long since become—interna-tional. 
” Here Comrade Sokolnikov is dissatisfied with two points— (1) speaking of the development of exchange, the programmedescribes an antiquated “period of development ”; (2) after the word “civilised” he puts an exclamation mark and says that “the close ties between metropolis and colony” are “not taken cognisance of” in our programme. 
 “Can protectionism, tariff wars, imperialist wars sever the ties of the proletarian movement? ” queries Comrade Sokolnikov? and he himself answers: “If we are to believethe text of our programme, they can, for they sever the ties established by exchange. 
” Rather strange criticism. 
 Neither protectionism, nor tar-iff wars “sever” exchange; they only change it temporarilyor interrupt it at one point, permitting its continuation atanother. 
 Exchange has not been eliminated by the presentwar, it has only been made difficult in some places and has shifted to other places, but it still remains an international tie. 
 The most obvious proof is the course of exchange. 
 Thisis the first point. 
 And secondly, we read in Comrade Sokol-nikov’s draft: “The development of productive forces, which,on the basis of the exchange of goods and the export ofcapital, draws all peoples into one world economy”, etc. 
 Imperialist war (in one place, for a time) also interrupts the export of capital, as well as exchange; therefore, ComradeSokolnikov’s “criticism” may be turned against him . 
 Thirdly, the old programme showed why the labour move-ment “ has long since become ” international. 
 It had un-questionably become international before the export of capital, which is the highest stage of capitalism. 
 To sum up: Comrade Sokolnikov inserted a bit of the definition of imperialism (the export of capital) in a placewhere it is obviously incongruous . 
 Moreover, the words “the civilised world” do not appeal to Comrade Sokolnikov, for, in his opinion, they refer to something peaceful and harmonious, and leave the coloniesout. 
 Quite the contrary. 
 Speaking of the “civilised world”, the programme points out the disharmony, the existence of uncivilised countries (this is a fact), while in Comrade Sokolnikov’s draft things appear much more harmonious , for it speaks simply of “drawing all peoples into one worldeconomy”! As if all peoples were equally drawn into this one world economy! As if there existed no relationship ofbondage between the uncivilised and the “civilised” peoples precisely on the basis of “all peoples” being drawn “into one world economy”. 
 Comrade Sokolnikov has really weakened the old programme on the two points he mentions. 
 He has put less emphasis on internationalism. 
 It is very important for us to pointout that it emerged long ago , long before the era of finance capital. 
 His wording gives the impression of a greater “har-mony” in respect of the colonies. 
 It is nevertheless unfortu-nately true that so far the labour movement has affected only the civilised countries, and to ignore this fact is notproper. 
 I would be ready to agree with Comrade Sokolnikov had he demanded a clearer exposition of the exploitation of the colonies. 
 That is a really important component of the concept “imperialism”. 
 But in the first section of ComradeSokolnikov’s draft, there is no mention of it. 
 He scatters the various component parts of the concept “imperialism” overseveral places to the detriment of consistency andclarity. 
 We shall soon see how Comrade Sokolnikov’s entire draft suffers from this looseness and inconsistency. 
 II Let the reader observe the general arrangement and the sequence of topics in the various sections of the old programme (we follow Comrade Sokolnikov’s numerical scheme): 1. 
 The labour movement has long since become interna-tional. 
 We are one of its contingents. 
 2. 
 The final goal of the movement is determined by the course of development of bourgeois society. 
 The point of departure is that the means of production are privatelyowned and the proletariat is propertyless. 
 3. 
 The growth of capitalism. 
 The crowding out of the small producers. 
 4. 
 The growth of exploitation (female labour, the reserve labour army, etc. 
). 
 5. 
 Crises. 
6. 
 The progress of technology; the growth of inequality. 
 7. 
 Growing struggle on the part of the proletariat. 
 Material conditions for the replacement of capitalism by socialism. 
 8. 
 The proletarian social revolution. 
 9. 
 Its premise—the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
 10. 
 The task of the Party—to lead the struggle of the pro-letariat for the social revolution. 
 I add another point: 11. 
 Capitalism has developed to its highest stage (imperi-alism), and the era of the proletarian revolution has now set in. 
 Compare this with the arrangement of the subject matter — not the individual corrections to the text, but the subjectmatter itself—in Comrade Sokolnikov’s draft, and also thepoints he adds on imperialism. 
 1. 
 The labour movement is international. 
 We are one of its contingents. 
 (Inserted—the export of capital, world economy, the growth of the struggle into the world revolu-tion; i. 
e. 
, a bit of the definition of imperialism isinserted. 
) 2. 
 The final goal of the movement is determined by the course of development of bourgeois society. 
 The point of departure is that the means of production are privately owned and the proletariat is propertyless. 
 (In the middleis inserted: omnipotent banks and syndicates, monopoly combines on a world scale; i. 
e. 
, another bit of the definition of imperialism is inserted. 
) 3. 
 The growth of capitalism. 
 The crowding out of the small producers. 
 4. 
 The growth of exploitation (female labour, the reserve labour army, foreign workers, etc. 
). 
 5. 
 Crises and wars. 
 Still another bit of the definition of imperialism is inserted: “attempts to partition the globe”; monopoly associations and the export of capital are repeated once more; the term “finance capital” is explained paren-thetically as meaning “the product of a merger of industrialand banking capital”. 
 6. 
 The progress of technology; the growth of inequality. 
 Yet another bit of the definition of imperialism is put in: high cost of living, militarism. 
 Monopoly associations are mentioned again. 
 7. 
 Growing struggle on the part of the proletariat. 
 Material conditions for the replacement of capitalism by socialism. 
In the middle there is an interpolation, again reiterating:“monopoly capitalism”, and pointing out how the banks and the syndicates have prepared the apparatus for social regu-lation, etc. 
 8. 
 The proletarian social revolution. 
 (A note that it will put an end to the rule of finance capital. 
) 9. 
 Its premise—the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
10. 
 The task of the Party—to lead the struggle of the pro-letariat for the social revolution. 
 (In the middle there is an interpolation that the latter is now on the order of theday. 
) I believe that this comparative study clearly shows that Comrade Sokolnikov’s draft suffers from the “mechanical”additions some comrades were so afraid of. 
 Without any logical sequence, various bits of the definition of imperialism have been scattered throughout the draft in the form of amosaic. 
 There is no general and integral characterisation ofimperialism. 
 There are too many repetitions. 
 The old canvasis preserved. 
 Preserved also is the general plan of the oldprogramme which points out that the “ultimate goal” of the movement is “determined” by the nature of contemporary bourgeois society and the course of its development . 
 But it is just this “course of development” which is not brought out; and the effect is that odds and ends of the definition of imperialism have been inserted, mostly inappropriately . 
 Let us take the second section. 
 Here Comrade Sokolni-kov left unchanged the beginning and the end; the begin-ning states that the means of production are in the handsof a minority; the end, that the majority of the populationare proletarians or semi-proletarians. 
 Right in the middle , Comrade Sokolnikov inserts a special phrase to the effect that “during the last quarter of a century the direct or indirect control of production organised on capitalist lines haspassed into the hands of all-powerful” banks, trusts, etc. 
 This is mentioned earlier than the crowding out of the small by the big producers ! The latter fact is first mentioned in the third section. 
 But are not trusts the highest and latest manifestation of the very process of the crowding out of small-scale by large-scale production? Is it appropriate tospeak first of trusts, and then of the ousting of the smallproducer? Is it not a violation of logical sequence? Where,then, did the trusts come from? Is this not an error in theory?How and why has control “passed” into their hands? All this cannot be understood before the process of the ousting of the small producer is made clear. 
 Let us take the third section that deals with the crowding out of small by large enterprises. 
 Here too Comrade Sokol-nikov retains the beginning (the increasing importance ofbig enterprises) and the end (small producers are being crowd-ed out). 
 In the middle, however, he adds that big enter-prises “have merged into gigantic organisms which combinea series of consecutive steps of production and exchange”. 
But this insertion deals with an entirely different matter,namely, the concentration of the means of production andthe socialisation of labour by capitalism, the creation of the material conditions for the replacement of capitalism by socialism. 
 In the old programme this point is not dealtwith until the seventh section. 
 Comrade Sokolnikov adheres to the general plan of the old programme. 
 He, too, speaks of the material conditionsfor the replacement of capitalism by socialism only in the seventh section. 
 He also retains in the seventh section a men-tion of the concentration of means of production and thesocialisation of labour! And so the concentration of capital is indicated in part a few paragraphs before an entire general, summarising section specially devoted to the subject. 
 This is devoid of all logic and is likely to render the programme less intelligible to themasses. 
 III Comrade Sokolnikov “subjects to a general revision” the fifth section of the programme, the one dealing with crises. 
He finds that the old programme “sins in theory to win popu-larity” and “deviates from Marx’s theory of crises”. 
 Comrade Sokolnikov suggests that the word “overproduc-tion” is made “the basis of the explanation” of crises in the old programme and that “such a view is more in keeping with the theory of Rodbertus 70 who explains crises as being due to under-consumption by the working class”. 
 A comparison of the old text with the new one proposed by Comrade Sokolnikov will show how unsuccessful his huntfor theoretical heresy has been, and how Rodbertus has been dragged in by the hair. 
 The old text contains the following, after mention (in the fourth section) of “technical progress”, intensified exploita-tion of labour, and relatively lower consumption by the work-ers: “ This state of affairs in the bourgeois countries, etc. 
, makes it more and more difficult for them to market com-modities produced in ever-increasing quantities. 
 Overpro-duction , manifesting itself in ... crises ... and periods of stagnation ... is an inevitable consequence.... 
” It is clear that here overproduction is by no means used as the “basis of the explanation” of crises, but that this isonly a description of the origin of crises and periods of stag-nation. 
 In Comrade Sokolnikov’s draft we read the follow-ing: “The development of the productive forces assuming these contra-dictory forms, in which the conditions of production come into con-flict with the conditions of consumption and the conditions for therealisation of capital with those for its accumulation—this develop-ment, whose sole motive force is the pursuit of profit, has as its inevi-table consequence acute industrial crises and depressions which signi-fy the cessation of the sale of commodities, anarchically produced inever-increasing quantities. 
” Comrade Sokolnikov said exactly the same thing, because “the cessation of the sale of commodities” produced in “ever-increasing quantities”, is exactly what we call overproduc-tion. 
 There is no need for him to fear this word, there is nothing inaccurate in it. 
 It is useless for Comrade Sokolnikovto write that instead of “overproduction”, “underproductionmight be used, with much the same or even more reason”(page 15 of the Moscow pamphlet). 
 Well, just try calling the “cessation of the sale of com-modities”, “produced in ever-increasing quantities”, “under-production”! It cannot be done. 
 Rodbertus’s theory is not merely a matter of using the word “overproduction” (which alone exactly describes one of the profoundest contradictions of capitalism), but of explain-ing crises merely as the result of insufficient consumption by the working class. 
 The old programme does not deduce crises from insufficient consumption. 
 It bases its explanation on“this state of affairs in the bourgeois countries”, as has been described in the preceding section of the programme andwhich consists in “technical progress” and “the relatively lower demand for human labour-power”. 
 Alongside of this the old programme speaks of “the ever-growing competitionon the world market ”. 
 Here something basic is said about the conflict between the conditions for accumulation and the conditions for real-isation, and is said much more clearly . 
 The theory has not been “changed” here at all, “to win popularity”, as Comrade Sokolnikov erroneously thinks, but is presented clearlyand popularly, which is a good point. 
 Of crises, to be sure, one could write volumes, one might give a more concrete analysis of the conditions of accumula-tion, mention the role of the means of production , of the exchange of surplus value and variable capital expressed in the means of production for constant capital expressed in articles of consumption, of the depreciation of constantcapital due to new inventions, and so on, and so forth. 
 But Comrade Sokolnikov makes no attempt to do this! His sup-posed correction of the programme consists only in the fol-lowing: 1. 
 Having preserved the plan of transition from the fourth to the fifth section, from the reference to technical progress, etc. 
, to crises, he weakened the connection between the two sections by leaving out the words, “ this state of affairs”. 
 2. 
 He added theoretical-sounding phrases about the con-flict between the conditions of production and the conditionsof consumption, and between the conditions for realisationand the conditions for accumulation—phrases which arequite correct but which do not express any new idea, for thepreceding section gives the substance of all this more clearly. 
 3. 
 He adds “the pursuit of profit”—an expression hardly suited to the programme, and which is used here, we suspect,precisely “ to win popularity”, for the same idea is expressed several times in the phrases about “conditions for realisa-tion”, commodity production, etc. 
 4. 
 He substitutes “depression” for “stagnation”; an unfor-tunate change. 
 5. 
 He adds the word “anarchically” to the old text (“com-modities, anarchically produced in ever-increasing quanti-ties”). 
 This addition is theoretically wrong, for “anarchy”or “absence of planning” using an expression from the ErfurtProgramme and contested by Engels, does not exactly char-acterise trusts. 
 * Here is how Comrade Sokolnikov puts it: “Commodities are anarchically produced in ever-increasing quan-tities. 
 Efforts of capitalist associations (trusts and the like) to pre-vent crises by limiting production end in failure,” etc. 
 But it is by trusts that commodities are not produced anarchically, but according to a plan. 
 Trusts do not merely “limit” production. 
 They do not make any efforts to prevent crises, nor can they make any such “efforts”. 
 Comrade So-kolnikov is guilty of a number of inaccuracies. 
 What heshould have said was: although trusts produce commoditiesnot anarchically but according to a plan, crises neverthelesscannot be averted because of the above-mentioned character-istics of capitalism which are also inherent in the trusts. 
 And if trusts, in periods of the greatest prosperity and specu-lation, limit production in the sense of being careful “not to *Engels criticised the expressions “private production” and “absence of planning” in the draft of the Erfurt Programme. 
 He wrote: “If we go over from stock companies to trusts, which dominate andmonopolise whole branches of industry, not only private production, but also the absence of planning comes to an end. 
” 71 go too far”, then at best they only succeed in saving the larg-est enterprises; but crises come just the same. 
 Summarising all that has been said on the question of crises, we come to the conclusion that Comrade Sokolnikovhas not improved upon the old programme. 
 On the contrary, the new draft contains inaccuracies. 
 The need to correct theold programme has not been proved. 
 IV In his draft Comrade Sokolnikov makes two theoretical errors on the question of wars of an imperialist nature. 
 First, he does not give an appreciation of the present war. 
 He says that the imperialist epoch generates imperial-ist wars. 
 This is correct and should, of course, be stated in the programme. 
 But this is not enough. 
 Besides this itis necessary to say that the present war of 1914-17 is imperial-ist. 
 The German Spartacus group in their “theses” publishedin German in 1915 advanced the proposition that in anera of imperialism national wars are impossible . 
 72 This is obviously a wrong assertion, for imperialism makes the oppression of nations more acute and, as a result, national revolts and national wars (attempts to draw a line of demar-cation between revolts and wars are doomed to failure) arenot only possible and probable but absolutely inevitable. 
 Marxism demands a very precise assessment of each sepa-rate war on the basis of concrete data. 
 To evade the questionof the present war by resorting to general discussions is wrongin theory and inadmissible in practice. 
 This method is used as a screen by the opportunists, they use it for evasion. 
 They say that imperialism is, in general, an epoch of imperialistwars, but this particular war is not wholly imperialist (thus argued, for instance, Kautsky). 
 Secondly, Comrade Sokolnikov links “crises and wars”, as if they were a two-in-one companion of capitalism in general, and of modern capitalism in particular. 
 On pages 20 and 21 of the Moscow pamphlet, he repeats the “crisesand wars” combination in his draft three times . 
 Here it is not only a question of the undesirability of repetitions inthe programme. 
 It is also a question of incorrectness in prin-ciple. 
 Crises in the shape of overproduction, or “cessation of the sale of commodities”, if Comrade Sokolnikov insists on banish-ing the word overproduction, are phenomena exclusive to capitalism. 
 But wars are also characteristic of the slave-owning and serf systems of economy. 
 Imperialist wars alsooccurred in the period of slavery (the war between Romeand Carthage was on both sides an imperialist war), as wellas in the Middle Ages and in the epoch of mercantile capital-ism. 
 A war is certainly imperialist if both warring sides oppress foreign countries or nationalities, and are fighting fortheir share of the loot and for the right to “oppress and rob”more than the others. 
 If we were to say that only modern capitalism, only imperialism, has brought imperialist wars in its wake, it would be correct, for the preceding stage of capitalism, the stage of free competition, or the stage of pre-monopolycapitalism, was characterised in Western Europe mainlyby national wars. 
 But if we were to say that in the preceding stage there were no imperialist wars at all, it would beincorrect. 
 It would mean that we had forgotten the “colonial” wars, which are also imperialist. 
 This is the first point. 
 And secondly, the linking up of “crises and wars” is par-ticularly incorrect, for these are quite different phenomenaof different historical origin and different class significance. 
For instance, it would be wrong to say, as Comrade Sokol-nikov says in his draft, that “both crises and wars, in turn, mean still greater ruin for the small producers and increase the dependence of hired labour on capital. 
 . 
 . 
”. 
 For therecould possibly be wars fought for the emancipation of hired labour from capital. 
 In the course of the struggle of wage-workers against the capitalist class, wars of a revolutionaryand not only of a reactionary-imperialist nature are possible. 
 War is the continuation of the politics of this or that class; and in every class society, slave-owning, feudal, or capitalist,there have been wars which continued the politics of theoppressor classes and also wars which continued the politicsof the oppressed classes. 
 This is exactly why it would bewrong to say, as Comrade Sokolnikov does, that “crises and wars show that the capitalist system is changing from a form of the development of productive forces into a hin-drance to it”. 
 It is true that the present imperialist war, by its reaction-ary character and the hardships it entails, revolutionises the masses and accelerates the revolution, and this must be stated. 
 It is also true that imperialist wars in general aretypical of an imperialist epoch, and this may be mentioned. 
 But it would be wrong to say this about all “wars” in general,and, moreover, under no circumstances should crises andwars be tied up together. 
 V We must draw our conclusions on the chief question which should, according to the unanimous decision of allBolsheviks, be primarily dealt with and assessed in thenew programme—the question of imperialism . 
 Comrade Sokolnikov maintains that such treatment and assessment could be more expediently given piecemeal, so to speak,dividing up the various characteristics of imperialismamong various sections of the programme. 
 I think it wouldbe more to the purpose to present it in a special sectionor a special part of the programme, by gathering together everything that there is to say about imperialism. 
 The mem-bers of the Party now have both drafts before them, and thecongress will decide. 
 We are in full accord with ComradeSokolnikov in that imperialism must be dealt with. 
 Whatwe must find out is whether there are differences of opinionas to how imperialism should be treated and assessed. 
 From this point of view let us examine the two drafts of the new programme. 
 In my draft five basic distinguish-ing features of imperialism are presented: (1) capitalistmonopoly associations; (2) the fusion of banking and indus-trial capital; (3) the export of capital to foreign countries;(4) the territorial partition of the globe, already completed; (5) the partition of the globe among international economic trusts. 
 (In my pamphlet Imperialism , the Highest Stage of Capitalism , which came out after the Materials Relating to the Revision of the Party Programme , these five distinguish-ing features of imperialism are cited on p. 
 85. 
 *) In Comrade Sokolnikov’s draft we actually find the same five basic fea-tures, so that on the question of imperialism there is appar-*See present edition, Vol.

— Ed. 
 ently complete agreement in principle within our Party—as was to be expected, for the practical propaganda of our Party on this question, both oral and printed, has long since, from the very beginning of the revolution, shown the completeunanimity of all the Bolsheviks on this fundamental ques-tion. 
 What remains to be examined is the differences in the way the definition and characterisation of imperialism are formulated . 
 Both drafts point specifically to the time when capitalism may be properly regarded as having becometransformed into imperialism. 
 The necessity for such astatement in the interests of precision and correct historicalevaluation of economic development would hardly bedenied. 
 Comrade Sokolnikov says: “during the last quarter of a century”; I say: “about the beginning of the twentieth century”. 
 In the above-mentioned pamphlet on imperialism(on pp: 10 and 11, for instance *) I cited the testimony of an economist who has made a special study of cartels andsyndicates. 
 According to him, the turn towards the complete victory of the cartels in Europe came with the crisis of 1900-03. 
 That is why, it seems, it would be more accurate to say: “about the beginning of the twentieth century” than“during the last quarter of a century”. 
 It would be more cor-rect for still another reason. 
 The above-mentioned specialistand all other European economists, generally work withdata supplied by Germany, and Germany is far ahead of other countries in the formation of cartels. 
 Furthermore, speaking of monopolies my draft says: “Monopolist associations of capitalists have assumed decisiveimportance. 
” Comrade Sokolnikov calls attention to mono-poly associations several times . 
 Only once is he fairly de-finite: “During the last quarter of a century the direct or indirect control of production organised on capitalist lines has passed into the hands of all-powerful, interlocking banks, trusts and syndicates which have formed world-wide monopoly associations under the direction of a handful of magnates of finance capital. 
” Here, it appears, there is too much “propaganda”. 
 “To win popularity” something that has no place there is injected *See present edition, Vol. 
 22, p. 
 200-02. 
— Ed. 
 into the programme. 
 In newspaper articles, in speeches, in popular pamphlets, “propaganda” is indispensable; the pro-gramme of a party, however, must be distinguished by the precision of its economics; it must contain nothing super-fluous. 
 The statement that “capitalist monopoly associationshave acquired decisive importance” seems to me more exact;it says all that is necessary. 
 Besides much superfluous matter,the above-quoted excerpt from Comrade Sokolnikov’s draft contains an expression questionable from the theoretical point of view—“control of production organised on capi-talist lines”. 
 Is it only organised on capitalist lines? No. 
This is too weak. 
 Even production not so organised—petty craftsmen, peasants, small cotton-growers in the colonies,etc. 
, etc. 
—has become dependent on banks and finance capital in general. 
 When we speak of “world capitalism” in general (and this is the only capitalism we can discusshere if we are not to make mistakes), our statement thatmonopolist associations acquire “a decisive importance”does not mean that any other producers are excluded from subordination to this rule. 
 To limit the influence of monopol-ist associations to “production organised on capitalist lines” is incorrect. 
 To proceed. 
 In his draft, Comrade Sokolnikov twice repeats the same thing about the role played by banks: oncein the above-quoted passage and a second time in the sectiondealing with crises and wars, where he defines finance capi-tal as “the product of a merger of banking and industrial capital”. 
 My draft says that “enormously concentrated bank-ing capital has fused with industrial capital”. 
 To say itonce in the programme is sufficient. 
 The third feature “the export of capital to foreign coun-tries has assumed vast dimensions” (so in my draft). 
 In Comrade Sokolnikov’s draft, we find a mere reference to the “export of capital” in one place, while in another, andin an entirely different connection, we read of “new coun-tries which are fields for the utilisation of capital exported insearch of superprofits”. 
 It is difficult to accept as correct thestatement on superprofits and new countries since capital has also been exported from Germany to Italy, from France to Switzerland, etc. 
 Under imperialism, capital has begunto be exported to the old countries as well, and not for super profits alone. 
 What is true with regard to the new countries is not true with regard to the export of capital in general. 
 The fourth feature is what Hilferding has called “the struggle for economic territory”. 
 This term is not exact, for it does not indicate what mostly distinguishes modern imperial-ism from the older forms of struggle for economic territory. 
 Ancient Rome fought for such territories; the European kingdoms in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries fought for such territories and acquired colonies; so did old Russiaby her conquest of Siberia, etc. 
 The distinguishing featureof modern imperialism is (as pointed out in my draft) that“the whole world has been divided up territorially amongthe richer countries”, i. 
e. 
, the partition of the earth among various states has been completed. 
 This circumstance makes the conflicts for a re-partitioning of the globe all the sharper, and is the cause of the particularly sharp collisions whichlead to war. 
 All this is expressed in Comrade Sokolnikov’s draft with great verbosity and is hardly accurate theoretically. 
 But before I quote his statement of the case which also includes the economic partitioning of the globe, I will first touchupon that fifth and last feature of imperialism. 
 Here is howthis is expressed in my draft: “The economic partitioning of the world among interna-tional trusts has begun. 
” The data of political economy and statistics do not warrant any more elaborate statement. 
 This partitioning of the world is a very important process, but it has just begun. 
 This partitioning, or rather re-partition-ing of the world, is bound to cause imperialist wars since the territorial partition is complete, i. 
e. 
, there are no more “free” lands that can be grabbed without war against a rival nation. 
 Let us see now how Comrade Sokolnikov formulates this part of the programme: “But the realm of capitalist relations becomes ever wider; they are carried across frontiers, into new lands. 
 These lands serve the capitalists as markets for commodities, as sources of raw materials,as fields for the utilisation of capital exported in search of superpro-fits. 
 The vast accumulation of surplus value at the disposal of finance capital (a product of a merger of banking and industrial capital) isdumped on to the world market. 
 The rivalry of powerful nationally and at times internationally organised associations of capitalists for command of the market, for the possession or control of territories ofweaker countries, i. 
e. 
, for the exclusive right to oppress them merci-lessly, inevitably leads to attempts at partitioning the whole world among the richest capitalist countries, to imperialist wars, which engender universal suffering, ruin, and degeneration. 
” Here we have too many words, covering up a series of theoretical errors. 
 One cannot speak of “attempts” at dividing up the world, because the world has already been divided up. 
 The war of 1914-17 is not “an attempt at partitioning”the world, but a struggle for the re-partitioning of a world already divided. 
 The war became inevitable for capitalism,because a few years before it imperialism divided up the world according to yardsticks of strength now out of date, and which are being “corrected” by the war. 
 The struggle for colonies (for “new lands”), and the struggle for “the possession of territories of weaker countries”, allexisted before imperialism. 
 Modern imperialism is charac-terised by something else , namely, by the fact that at the beginning of the twentieth century the whole earth was divided up and occupied by various countries. 
 That is why, under capitalism, the re-partitioning of “world domination”could only take place at the price of a world war. 
 “Inter-nationally organised associations of capitalists” existedbefore imperialism. 
 Every joint-stock company with a membership of capitalists from various countries is an “inter-nationally organised association of capitalists”. 
 The distinguishing feature of imperialism is something quite different , something which did not exist before the twentieth century—the economic partitioning of the worldamong international trusts, the partitioning of countries,by agreement , into market areas. 
 This particular point has not been expressed in Comrade Sokolnikov’s draft, the power of imperialism is, therefore, represented as much weaker than it really is. 
 Finally, it is theoretically incorrect to speak of dumping a vast accumulation of surplus value on to the world market. 
 This reminds one of Proudhon’s theory of realisation, accord-ing to which capitalists may easily realise both fixed and variable capital, but find it difficult to realise surplus value. 
 As a matter of fact capitalists cannot realise without difficulties and crises either surplus value or variable and fixed capital. 
 Commodities dumped on to the market are not only accumulated value, but also value reproducing variable capital and fixed capital. 
 For instance, stocks of railsor iron are thrown into the world market, and should beexchanged for articles consumed by the workers, or for othermeans of production (wood, oil, etc. 
). 
 VI Having thus concluded our analysis of Comrade Sokolni-kov’s draft, we must note one very valuable addition whichhe proposes and which in my opinion should be adopted andeven developed. 
 To the paragraph which deals with techni-cal progress and the greater employment of female and child labour, he proposes to add the phrase “as well as the labourof unskilled foreign workers imported from backward coun-tries”. 
 This addition is valuable and necessary. 
 The exploi-tation of worse paid labour from backward countries is particularly characteristic of imperialism. 
 On this exploi-tation rests, to a certain degree, the parasitism of rich impe-rialist countries which bribe a part of their workers withhigher wages while shamelessly and unrestrainedly exploit-ing the labour of “cheap” foreign workers. 
 The words “worsepaid” should be added and also the words “and frequentlydeprived of rights”; for the exploiters in “civilised” countries always take advantage of the fact that the imported foreign workers have no rights. 
 This is often to be seen in Germanyin respect of workers imported from Russia; in Switzerlandof Italians; in France, of Spaniards and Italians, etc. 
 It would be expedient, perhaps, to emphasise more strong-ly and to express more vividly in our programme the pro-minence of the handful of the richest imperialist countries which prosper parasitically by robbing colonies and weak-er nations. 
 This is an extremely important feature ofimperialism. 
 To a certain extent it facilitates the rise ofpowerful revolutionary movements in countries that aresubjected to imperialist plunder, and are in danger of being crushed and partitioned by the giant imperialists (such as Russia), and on the other hand, tends to a certain extent toprevent the rise of profound revolutionary movements in the countries that plunder, by imperialist methods, many colonies and foreign lands, and thus make a very large (com-paratively) portion of their population participants in the division of the imperialist loot. 
 I would therefore suggest that the point on this exploita-tion of a number of weak countries by the richest should beinserted in that section of my draft where social-chauvinismis described (page 22 of the pamphlet *). 
 The relevant passage in the draft would then assume the following form (the additions are in italics): “Such a perversion is, on the one hand, the social-chauvin-ist trend, socialism in word and chauvinism in deed, theuse of the ‘defence of the fatherland’ slogan to hide thepredatory interests ‘their own’ national bourgeoisie pursues in an imperialist war and to maintain the privileged position of citizens of rich nations which make enormous profits by pillag-ing colonies and weak nations. 
 Another such perversion, on the other hand, is the equally wide and internationalmovement of the ‘Centre’, etc. 
” It is necessary to add the words “in an imperialist war” for greater accuracy. 
 “Defence of the fatherland” is nothing but a slogan to justify the war, the recognition of it as legit-imate and just. 
 There are different kinds of wars. 
 Theremay also be revolutionary wars. 
 We must therefore sayprecisely what we mean: imperialist war. 
 This is of courseimplied, but to avoid misinterpretation, it must not be implied, but stated directly and clearly. 
 VII From the general or theoretical part of the programme we shall now turn to the minimum programme. 
 Here we at once encounter the ostensibly “very radical” but reallyvery groundless proposal of Comrades N. 
 Bukharin andV. 
 Smirnov to discard the minimum programme in toto . 
 The division into maximum and minimum programmes isout of date, they claim. 
 Since we speak of a transition to socialism there is no need for it. 
 No minimum programmes; *See present edition, Vol. 
 24, p. 
 470. 
— Ed. 
 our programme must indicate measures for the transition to socialism. 
 Such is the proposal of these two comrades. 
 For some reason, they have not ventured to offer their own draft(although, since the revision of the Party programme wason the agenda of the next congress of the Party, they werereally under an obligation to work out a draft). 
 It is possiblethat the authors of the ostensibly “radical” proposal have themselves halted in indecision .... 
 Be that as it may, their opinion should be examined. 
 War and economic ruin have forced all countries to ad-vance from monopoly capitalism to state monopoly capital-ism. 
 This is the objective state of affairs. 
 In a revolutionarysituation, during a revolution, however, state monopoly capitalism is directly transformed into socialism. 
 During a revolution it is impossible to move forward without movingtowards socialism—this is the objective state of affairscreated by war and revolution. 
 It was taken cognisance ofby our April Conference, which put forward the slogans,“a Soviet Republic” (the political form of the dictatorship of the proletariat), and the nationalisation of banks and syn-dicates (a basic measure in the transition towards socialism). 
Up to this point all the Bolsheviks unanimously agree. 
 ButComrades Smirnov and Bukharin want to go farther, theywant to discard the minimum programme in toto . 
 This is contrary to the wise counsel of the wise proverb, “ Do not boast when riding to battle ; boast when you return from it ”. 
 We are riding to battle, that is, we are fighting for the con-quest of political power by our Party. 
 This power would bethe dictatorship of the proletariat and the poor peasants. 
In taking power, we are not at all afraid of stepping beyondthe bounds of the bourgeois system; on the contrary, we de-clare clearly, directly, definitely, and openly that we shall step beyond those bounds, that we shall fearlessly marchtowards socialism, that our road shall be through a SovietRepublic, through nationalisation of banks and syndicates,through workers’ control, through universal labour conscrip-tion, through nationalisation of the land, confiscation of the landowners’ livestock and implements, etc. 
 In this sense we drafted our programme of measures for transition tosocialism. 
 But we must not boast when riding to battle, we must not discard the minimum programme, for this would be an empty boast: we do not wish to “demand anything from the bourgeoisie”, we wish to realise everything ourselves, wedo not wish to work on petty details within the frameworkof bourgeois society. 
 This would be an empty boast, because first of all we must win power, which has not yet been done. 
 We must first carry out the measures of transition to socialism, we must con-tinue our revolution until the world socialist revolution isvictorious, and only then, “ returning from battle ”, may we discard the minimum programme as of no further use. 
 Is it possible to guarantee now that the minimum pro-gramme will not be needed any more? Of course not, for the simple reason that we have not yet won power, that social-ism has not yet been realised, and that we have not achievedeven the beginning of the world socialist revolution. 
 We must firmly, courageously, and without hesitation advance towards our goal, but it is ludicrous to declare that we have reached it when we definitely have not. 
 Discarding the minimum programme would be equivalent to declaring, to announcing (to bragging, in simple language) that we havealready won. 
 No, dear comrades, we have not yet won. 
We do not know whether our victory will come tomorrow or a little later. 
 (I personally am inclined to think that it will be tomorrow—I am writing this on October 6, 1917— and that there may be a delay in our seizure of power; still,tomorrow is tomorrow and not today. 
) We do not know howsoon after our victory revolution will sweep the West. 
 Wedo not know whether or not our victory will be followedby temporary periods of reaction and the victory of the counter-revolution—there is nothing impossible in that— and therefore, after our victory, we shall build a “tripleline of trenches” against such a contingency. 
 We do not know and cannot know anything of this. 
 No one is in a position to know. 
 It is therefore ridiculous to discardthe minimum programme, which is indispensable while we still live within the framework of bourgeois society, while we have not yet destroyed that framework, not yet realised thebasic prerequisites for a transition to socialism, not yet smashed the enemy (the bourgeoisie), and even if we have smashed them we have not yet annihilated them. 
 All this will come, and perhaps much sooner than many people think (I personally think that it will begin tomorrow), but it has not yet come. 
 Take the minimum programme in the political sphere. 
 This programme is limited to the bourgeois republic. 
 Weadd that we do not confine ourselves to its limits, we start immediately upon a struggle for a higher type of republic, a Soviet Republic . 
 This we must do. 
 With unshakable cour-age and determination we must advance towards the newrepublic and in this way we shall reach our goal , of that I am sure . 
 But the minimum programme should under no circumstances be discarded, for, first of all, there is as yet no Soviet Republic; secondly, “attempts at restoration” are not out of the question, and they will first have to beexperienced and vanquished; thirdly, during the transitionfrom the old to the new there may be temporary “combinedtypes” (as Rabochy Put correctly pointed out a day or two ago)—for instance, a Soviet Republic together with a Con-stituent Assembly. 
 Let us first get over all that—then it will be time to discard the minimum programme. 
 The same in the economic sphere. 
 We all agree that the fear of marching towards socialism is the most contemptible treason to the cause of the proletariat. 
 We all agree that the most important of the first steps to be taken must be such measures as the nationalisation of banks and syndicates. 
 Let us first realise this and other similar measures, andthen we shall see . 
 Then we shall be able to see better , for practical experience, which is worth a million times morethan the best of programmes, will considerably widen ourhorizon. 
 It is possible, and even probable, nay, indubitable, that without transitional “combined types” the change will not take place. 
 We shall not, for instance, be able to nation-alise petty enterprises with one or two hired labourers atshort notice or subject them to real workers’ control. 
 Theirrole may be insignificant, they may be bound hand and footby the nationalisation of banks and trusts, but so long as there are even odds and ends of bourgeois relations, why abandon the minimum programme? As Marxists, advancingboldly to the world’s greatest revolution, but at the same time taking a sober view of the facts, we have no right to abandon the minimum programme. 
 By abandoning it we should prove that we have lost our heads before we have won. 
 And we must not lose our headseither before our victory, at the time of victory, or after it;for if we lose our heads, we lose everything. 
 Comrade Bukharin actually proposed nothing concrete; he only repeated what had been said long before concerning the nationalisation of banks and syndicates. 
 Comrade Smir-nov in his article offered a very interesting and instructiveseries of tentative reforms that may be reduced to the regu-lation of production and consumption of commodities. 
 Ina general way all this is contained in my draft, followed by an “ etc. 
”. 
 To go further, to venture into a discussion of sepa-rate and concrete measures, seems to me inexpedient. 
 Many things will become clearer after the basic measures of the new type have been carried out, after the nationalisation of banks, after the introduction of workers’ control; experience will tell us a lot more , for it will be the experience of mil-lions, the experience in building a new system of economy with the conscious participation of millions. 
 It stands to reason that to indicate the new, develop plans, evaluate them, analyse the local and partial experiences of various Sovietsor supply committees, etc. 
, is all very useful work to bedone in articles, pamphlets and speeches. 
 But to inject intothe programme an overdose of detail is premature and may become even harmful by tying our hands with petty matters. 
 Our hands must be free so that we may build the new withgreater vigour, once we have fully entered upon the new path. 
 VIII Comrade Bukharin’s article touches upon another question worthy of consideration. 
 “The question of the revision of our Party programme should be bound up with the question of working out a single programme for the international party of the proletariat. 
” This is not very clearly expressed. 
 If we take it to mean that the author advises us not to accept a new programmeuntil a single international programme, a programme of theThird International, has been drawn up, then we have to object to this opinion most decisively. 
 To postpone it on this account (I presume that there are no other reasons for delay; no one, for instance, demanded a postponement on account of inadequate preparation of our Party materialfor the revision) would be equivalent to our delaying the foundation of the Third International. 
 The foundation of theThird International ought not of course to be understoodformally. 
 Not until the proletarian revolution has triumphed in at least one country, or until the war has come to an end, may we hope for a speedy and successful advance in conven-ing a great conference of internationalist revolutionary parties of various countries; or for their consent to a formaladoption of a new programme. 
 In the meantime we mustadvance our cause on the initiative of those parties which are now in a more favourable position than the others and can take the first step—not viewing it, of course, as the laststep, not necessarily opposing their programme to other“Left” (i. 
e. 
, internationalist revolutionary) programmes, butworking directly towards the formulation of a general pro-gramme. 
 Outside of Russia there is at present no other country in the world where there is comparative freedom for internationalists to meet, and where there are as manycomrades well informed on subjects concerning internation-al movements and programmes as there are in our Party. 
This is why we must take the initiative upon ourselves. 
This is our immediate duty as internationalists. 
 Apparently Comrade Bukharin views this matter in exactly the same way. 
 At the beginning of the article he says that “theParty Congress which has just been concluded [it waswritten in August] recognised the necessity of revising theprogramme” and that “a special congress will be called forthis purpose”. 
 We conclude from this that Comrade Bukha-rin has no objections to the adoption of a new programme at that congress. 
 If so, then we have perfect unanimity on this question. 
 Hardly anyone would be against the proposition that ourcongress, upon adopting a new programme, express a desireto draw up a single general programme for the Third Inter-national, and take certain steps in that direction—hasten the conference of the Lefts, publish a collection of articlesin several languages, set up a committee for the purpose of collecting material on what has been done in other coun-tries in order to “feel the way” (according to Comrade Bukha-rin’s correct expression) for a new programme (the “Tribun-ists”73 in Holland, the Lefts in Germany. 
 The Socialist Propaganda League in America74 has already been men-tioned by Comrade Bukharin; we may also mention theAmerican Socialist Labour Party 75 and its demand that “the political state give way to industrial democracy”). 
 Comrade Bukharin has pointed out a flaw in my draft which I must acknowledge to be absolutely correct. 
 Hecites a passage in the draft (page 23 of the pamphlet *) where I discuss the present situation in Russia, the capitalistProvisional Government, etc. 
 Comrade Bukharin is right incriticising this passage and saying that it should be trans-ferred to the resolution on tactics or to the platform. 
 I therefore propose either to leave out the last paragraphon page 23 altogether, or to put it as follows: “Striving for a political system which would best ensure economic progress and the rights of the people in general,and, in particular, make the transition to socialism as pain-less as possible, the party of the proletariat cannot rest con-tent”, etc. 
 Finally, I must answer one question raised by a few com-rades, but as far as I know, not yet discussed in the press. 
This is the question of Clause 9 of our political programmeon the right of nations to self-determination. 
 This clause consists of two parts: the first part is a new statement on the right to self-determination; the second contains not a de-mand but a declaration. 
 I am asked whether a declaration isin place here. 
 Generally speaking, there is no place for decla-rations in a programme, but I think an exception to the ruleis necessary here. 
 Instead of the word self-determination, which has given rise to numerous misinterpretations, I pro-pose the perfectly precise concept: “the right to free seces-sion”. 
 After six months’ experience of the 1917 Revolution, itis hardly possible to dispute that the party of the revolu-tionary proletariat of Russia, the party which uses the Great-Russian language, is obliged to recognise the right to secede. 
 When we win power, we shall immediately and uncondition-*See present edition, Vol. 
 24, p. 
 471. 
— Ed. 
 ally recognise this right for Finland, the Ukraine, Armenia, and any other nationality oppressed by tsarism (and the Great-Russian bourgeoisie). 
 On the other hand, we do not at all favour secession. 
 We want as vast a state, as closean alliance of the greatest possible number of nations whoare neighbours of the Great Russians; we desire this in theinterests of democracy and socialism, to attract into thestruggle of the proletariat the greatest possible number of the working people of different nations. 
 We desire proletarian revolutionary unity, unification , and not secession. 
 We desire revolutionary unification; that is why our slogan does not call for unification of all states in general, for the socialrevolution demands the unification only of those states which have gone over or are going over to socialism, colonies which are gaining their freedom, etc. 
 We want free unification; that is why we must recognise the right to secede (withoutfreedom to secede, unification cannot be called free). 
 Themore so must we recognise the right of secession, becausetsarism and the Great-Russian bourgeoisie have by theiroppression left great bitterness and distrust of the Great Russians generally in the hearts of the neighbouring nations, and these must be eradicated by deeds and not by words. 
 But we want unification, and this must be stated; it is so important to state it in the programme of a party of aheterogeneous state that it is necessary to abandon customand to incorporate a declaration. 
 We want the republic of the Russian (I am even inclined to say Great-Russian, for this is more correct) people to attract other nations to it. 
 But how? Not by violence, but solely by voluntary agreement. 
Otherwise the unity and the brotherly ties of the workers of all countries are broken. 
 Unlike the bourgeois democrats,we call for the brotherhood of workers of all nationalities, and not the brotherhood of nations, for we do not trust the bourgeoisie of any country, we regard them as our enemies. 
 This is why we should here allow an exception to the rule by inserting in Clause 9 a declaration of principles. 
 IX The foregoing pages were written before No. 
 31 of Rabochy Put appeared with Comrade Y. 
 Larin’s article “The Labour Demands of Our Programme”. 
 We welcome this article as the beginning of the discussion of the various draft programmes by our Central Organ. 
 Comrade Larin dwells especially on that section of the programme which I had no occasion to work upon, and the draft for which is in the possession ofthe editors of the “Subsection on Labour Protection”, thesubsection was formed at the Conference of April 24-29, 1917. 
Comrade Larin proposes a number of additions which seem to me quite acceptable but which, I am sorry to say, are not always quite accurately expressed. 
 One point seems to me to have been ineptly formulated by Comrade Larin: “The correct [?] distribution of thelabour force on the basis [?] of democratic [?] self-govern-ment by the workers in deciding how to employ [?] theirpersons [?]”. 
 In my opinion this is worse than the formula-tion of the subsection: “The labour exchanges must be pro-letarian class organisations”, etc. 
 (see Materials , p. 
 15). 
 Comrade Larin, moreover, should have gone into the prob-lem of a minimum wage much more thoroughly. 
 He shouldhave formulated his proposition with greater exactness,and should have related it to the history of the views of Marx and Marxism on this subject. 
 Furthermore, Comrade Larin thinks that the political and agrarian parts of the programme should have been “morecarefully edited”. 
 We do hope that our Party press forth-with begins to discuss the question of editing this or that demand, without waiting for the congress, since, firstly, we shall not have a well prepared congress, and secondly, everyone who has had occasion to work on programmes andresolutions knows how often a careful editing of a certain point discloses and eliminates vagueness and disagreements of principle. 
 Finally, concerning the financial and economic part of the programme, Comrade Larin writes that “it is almost a blank, no mention is made, even of the annulment of warloans and the state debts contracted by tsarism [only tsar-ism?] or of the struggle against the fiscal utilisation of statemonopolies, etc. 
”. 
 It is extremely desirable for ComradeLarin not to postpone his practical proposals in anticipation of the congress. 
 He should bring them up immediately, or we shall not be well prepared for the congress. 
 On the ques-tion of the annulment of state debts (and of course, not of tsarism alone, but also of the bourgeoisie) we must give con-siderable thought to the question of small bondholders. 
 As to the question about “the struggle against the fiscal utili-sation of state monopolies”, we must see how things standwith the monopoly production of articles of luxury, and whatconnection the proposed point has with programme demandsfor the abolition of all indirect taxes. 
 I repeat: in order to prepare our programme seriously, to ensure the actual co-operation of the entire Party, all those interested must immediately get busy and publish their suggestions as well as precise drafts of points already edited and which contain additions and amendments. 
 ADVICE OF AN ONLOOKER I am writing these lines on October 8 and have little hope that they will reach Petrograd comrades by the 9th. 
 It is possible that they will arrive too late, since the Congressof the Northern Soviets has been fixed for October 10. 
 Nev-ertheless, I shall try to give my “Advice of an Onlooker”in the event that the probable action of the workers andsoldiers of Petrograd and of the whole “region” will take place soon but has not yet taken place. 
 It is clear that all power must pass to the Soviets. 
 It should be equally indisputable for every Bolshevik thatproletarian revolutionary power (or Bolshevik power—whichis now one and the same thing) is assured of the utmostsympathy and unreserved support of all the working and exploited people all over the world in general, in the belli-gerent countries in particular, and among the Russianpeasants especially. 
 There is no need to dwell on these alltoo well known and long established truths. 
 What must be dealt with is something that is probably not quite clear to all comrades, namely, that in practice the transfer of power to the Soviets now means armed upris-ing. 
 This would seem obvious, but not everyone has or isgiving thought to the point. 
 To repudiate armed uprisingnow would mean to repudiate the key slogan of Bolshevism(All Power to the Soviets) and proletarian revolutionaryinternationalism in general. 
 But armed uprising is a special form of political struggle, one subject to special laws to which attentive thoughtmust be given. 
 Karl Marx expressed this truth with remark-able clarity when he wrote that “ insurrection is an art quite as much as war ”. 
 Of the principal rules of this art, Marx noted the following: (1)Never play with insurrection, but when beginning it realise firmly that you must go all the way. 
 (2) Concentrate a great superiority of forces at the decisive point and at the decisive moment, otherwise the enemy, whohas the advantage of better preparation and organisation, will destroy the insurgents. 
 (3) Once the insurrection has begun, you must act with the greatest determination , and by all means, without fail, take the of offensive . 
 “The defensive is the death of every armed rising. 
” (4) You must try to take the enemy by surprise and seize the moment when his forces are scattered. 
 (5) You must strive for daily successes, however small (one might say hourly, if it is the case of one town), and atall costs retain “ moral superiority ”. 
 Marx summed up the lessons of all revolutions in respect to armed uprising in the words of “Danton, the greatest master of revolutionary policy yet known: de l ’audace , de l’audace , encore de l ’audace ”. 
 76 Applied to Russia and to October 1917, this means: a simultaneous offensive on Petrograd, as sudden and as rapidas possible, which must without fail be carried out fromwithin and from without, from the working-class quarters and from Finland, from Revel and from Kronstadt, an offen-sive of the entire navy, the concentration of a gigantic supe-riority of forces over the 15,000 or 20,000 (perhaps more) of our “bourgeois guard” (the officers’ schools), our “Vendéetroops” (part of the Cossacks), etc. 
 Our three main forces—the fleet, the workers, and the army units—must be so combined as to occupy without fail and to hold at any cost : (a) the telephone exchange; (b) the telegraph office; (c) the railway stations; (d) and above all,the bridges. 
 The most determined elements (our “shock forces” and young workers , as well as the best of the sailors) must be formed into small detachments to occupy all the more impor-tant points and to take part everywhere in all important operations, for example: to encircle and cut off Petrograd; to seize it by a combined attack of the sailors, the workers, and the troops—a task which requires art and triple audacity ; to form detachments from the best workers, armed with rifles and bombs, for the purpose of attacking and surround-ing the enemy’s “centres” (the officers’ schools, the tele-graph office, the telephone exchange, etc. 
). 
 Their watch-word must be: “ Better die to a man than let the enemy pass !” Let us hope that if action is decided on, the leaders will successfully apply the great precepts of Danton and Marx. 
 The success of both the Russian and the world revolution depends on two or three days’ fighting. 
 Written on October 8 (21), 1917 First published in November 7, Published according 1920 in the newspaper Pravda No. 
 250 to the newspaper text Signed: An Onlooker LETTER TO THE BOLSHEVIK COMRADES ATTENDING THE CONGRESS OF SOVIETS OF THE NORTHERN REGION Comrades, Our revolution is passing through a highly critical period. 
 This crisis coincides with the great crisis—the growth of the world socialist revolution and the struggle waged against it by world imperialism. 
 A gigantic task is being presentedto the responsible leaders of our Party, and failure to performit will involve the danger of a complete collapse of theinternationalist proletarian movement. 
 The situation is suchthat, in truth, delay would be fatal. 
 Take a glance at the international situation. 
 The growth of a world revolution is beyond dispute. 
 The outburst ofindignation on the part of the Czech workers has been sup-pressed with incredible ferocity, testifying to the govern-ment’s extreme fright. 
 Italy too has witnessed a mass out-break in Turin. 
 77 Most important, however, is the revolt in the German navy. 
 One can imagine the enormous difficulties of a revolution in a country like Germany, especially under pres-ent conditions. 
 It cannot be doubted that the revolt in theGerman navy is indicative of the great crisis—the growthof the world revolution. 
 While our chauvinists, who areadvocating Germany’s defeat, demand a revolt of the Ger-man workers immediately, we Russian revolutionary inter-nationalists know from the experience of 1905-17 that a moreimpressive sign of the growth of revolution than a revoltamong the troops cannot be imagined. 
 Just think what our position is now in the eyes of the German revolutionaries. 
 They can say to us: We have only Liebknecht who openly called for a revolution. 
 His voice has been stifled in a convict prison. 
 We have not a singlenewspaper which openly explains the necessity for a revolu-tion; we have not got freedom of assembly. 
 We have not a single Soviet of Workers’ or Soldiers’ Deputies. 
 Our voice barely reaches the real, broad mass of people. 
 Yet we made an attempt at revolt, although our chance was only one in ahundred. 
 But you Russian revolutionary internationalistshave behind you a half-year of free agitation, you have ascore of newspapers, you have a number of Soviets of Work-ers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies, you have gained the upper hand in the Soviets of Petrograd and Moscow, you have on your side the entire Baltic fleet and all the Russian troops inFinland. 
 And still you do not respond to our call for anuprising, you do not overthrow your imperialist, Kerensky,although the chances are a hundred to one that your upris-ing will be successful. 
 Yes, we shall be real traitors to the International if, at such a moment and under such favourable conditions, werespond to this call from the German revolutionaries with... mere resolutions. 
 Add to this, as we all perfectly well know, that the plot-ting and conspiracy of the international imperialists against the Russian revolution are rapidly growing. 
 International imperialism is coming closer to the idea of stifling the revo-lution at all costs, stifling it both by military measures andby a peace made at the expense of Russia. 
 It is this that ismaking the crisis in the world socialist revolution so acute,and is rendering our delay of the uprising particularly dangerous—I would almost say criminal. 
 Take, further, Russia’s internal situation. 
 The petty-bourgeois compromising parties which expressed the naïveconfidence of the masses in Kerensky and in the imperial-ists in general, are absolutely bankrupt. 
 Their collapseis complete. 
 The vote cast against coalition by the Soviet curia at the Democratic Conference, the vote cast against coalition by a majority of the local Soviets of Peasants’ Deputies (in spite of their central Soviet, where Avksen-tyev and other friends of Kerensky’s are installed), theelections in Moscow, where the working-class population hasthe closest ties with the peasants, and where over 49 per cent voted for the Bolsheviks (and among the soldiers fourteen thousand out of seventeen thousand)—does this not signifythat the confidence of the people in Kerensky and in those who are compromising with Kerensky and Co. 
 has completely collapsed? Can one imagine any way in which the people could say more clearly to the Bolsheviks than they did by this vote, “Lead us, we shall follow you”? And we, who have thus won the majority of the people over to our side, and who have gained the Soviets in boththe capital cities—are we to wait? What for? For Kerenskyand his Kornilovite generals to surrender Petrograd to the Germans, and thus enter directly or indirectly, openly or secretly, into a conspiracy with both Buchanan and Wilhelm for the purpose of completely stifling the Russian revolution. 
 By the Moscow vote and by the re-elections to the Soviets, the people have expressed their confidence in us, but that isnot all. 
 There are signs of growing apathy and indifference. 
 That is understandable. 
 It implies not the ebb of the revo-lution, as the Cadets and their henchmen vociferate, butthe ebb of confidence in resolutions and elections. 
 In arevolution, the masses demand action, not words from theleading parties, they demand victories in the struggle, nottalk. 
 The moment is approaching when the people may con-ceive the idea that the Bolsheviks are no better than the others, since they were unable to act when the people placed confidence in them.... 
 The peasant revolt is spreading over the whole country. 
 It is perfectly clear that the Cadets and their hangers-onare minimising it in every way and are claiming it to be nothing but “riots” and “anarchy”. 
 That lie is being refuted because in the revolt centres the land is beginning to behanded over to the peasants. 
 “Riots” and “anarchy” havenever led to such splendid political results! The tremendousstrength of the peasant revolt is shown by the fact that thecompromisers and the Socialist-Revolutionaries of Dyelo Naroda , and even Breshko-Breshkovskaya, have begun to talk of transferring the land to the peasants in order to checkthe movement before it has finally engulfed them. 
 Are we to wait until the Cossack units of the Kornilovite Kerensky (who was recently exposed as a Kornilovite bythe Socialist-Revolutionaries themselves) succeed in sup-pressing this peasant revolt piecemeal ? Apparently, many leaders of our Party have failed to note the specific meaning of the slogan which we all adopted and which we have repeated endlessly. 
 The slogan is “All Power to the Soviets”. 
 There were periods, there were moments during the six months of the revolution, when this slogan did not mean insurrection. 
 Perhaps those periods and those moments blinded some of our comrades and led them toforget that now, at least since the middle of September,this slogan for us too has become equivalent to a call for insurrection . 
 There can be no shadow of doubt on this score. 
 Dyelo Naroda recently explained this “in a popular way”, when it said “Kerensky will under no circumstances submit!” As ifhe could! The slogan “All Power to the Soviets” is nothing but a call for insurrection. 
 And the blame will be wholly and undoubtedly ours, if we, who for months have been calling upon the people to revolt and repudiate compromise, failto lead them to revolt on the eve of the revolution’s collapse,after the people have expressed their confidence in us. 
 The Cadets and compromisers are trying to scare us by citing the example of July 3-5, by pointing to the intensified agitation of the Black Hundreds, 78 and so forth. 
 But if any mistake was made on July 3-5, it was that we did nottake power. 
 I do not think we made a mistake then, forat that time we were not yet in a majority. 
 But now it would be a fatal mistake, worse than a mistake. 
 The spread of Black-Hundred agitation is understandable. 
 It is an aggravation of extremes in an atmosphere of a developing proletarian and peasant revolution. 
 But to use this as an argument againstan uprising is ridiculous, for the impotence of the BlackHundreds, hirelings of the capitalists, the impotence of the Black Hundreds in the struggle , does not even require proof. 
 In the struggle they are not worth considering. 
 In the strug-gle Kornilov and Kerensky can only rely on the Savage Division and the Cossacks. 
 And now demoralisation has setin even among the Cossacks; furthermore, the peasants arethreatening them with civil war within their Cossack regions. 
 I am writing these lines on Sunday, October 8. 
 You will read them not earlier than October 10. 
 I have heard from a comrade who passed through here that people travelling on the Warsaw railway say, “Kerensky is bringing Cossacksto Petrograd!” This is quite probable, and it will be entirely our fault if we do not verify it most carefully and do not make a study of the strength and distribution of the Korni-lovite troops of the second draft. 
 Kerensky has again brought Kornilovite troops into the vicinity of Petrograd in order to prevent state power frompassing into the hands of the Soviets, in order to preventthis power from proposing an immediate peace, in order toprevent all the land from being immediately handed over to the peasants, in order to surrender Petrograd to the Germans, and himself escape to Moscow! That is the slogan of theinsurrection which we must circulate as widely as possibleand which will have a tremendous success. 
 We must not wait for the All-Russia Congress of Soviets, which the Central Executive Committee may delay even un-til November. 
 We must not delay and permit Kerensky to bring up more Kornilovite troops. 
 Finland, the fleet andRevel are represented at the Congress of Soviets. 
 These cantogether start an immediate movement on Petrograd againstthe Kornilovite regiments, a movement of the fleet, artillery,machine-guns and two or three army corps, such as have shown, for instance in Vyborg, the intensity of their hatred for the Kornilovite generals, with whom Kerensky is againin collusion. 
 It would be a great mistake to refuse to seize the oppor-tunity of immediately smashing the Kornilovite regimentsof the second draft on the ground that the Baltic fleet, by moving into Petrograd, would allegedly expose the front to the Germans. 
 The Kornilovite slanderers will say this, asthey will tell any lie, but it is unworthy of revolutionariesto allow themselves to be intimidated by lies and slanders. 
Kerensky will surrender Petrograd to the Germans, thatis now as clear as daylight. 
 No assertions to the contrary can destroy our full conviction that this is so, for it follows from the entire course of events and Kerensky’s entire policy. 
 Kerensky and the Kornilovites will surrender Petrograd to the Germans. 
 And it is in order to save Petrograd thatKerensky must be overthrown and power taken by the Soviets of both capital cities . 
 These Soviets will immediately pro-pose a peace to all the nations and will thereby fulfil their duty to the German revolutionaries. 
 They will thereby alsobe taking a decisive step towards frustrating the criminal conspiracies against the Russian revolution, the conspira-cies of international imperialism. 
 Only the immediate movement of troops from Finland, and of the Baltic fleet, Revel and Kronstadt against the Kor-nilovite forces quartered near Petrograd can save the Rus-sian and the world revolution. 
 Such a movement has a hund-red to one chance of leading within a few days to the surren-der of a part of the Cossack troops, to the utter defeat of the other part, and to the overthrow of Kerensky, for the workers and the soldiers of both capital cities will support such amovement. 
 In truth, delay would be fatal. 
The slogan “All Power to the Soviets” is a slogan of insur-rection. 
 Whoever uses this slogan without having grasped this and given thought to it will have only himself to blame. 
 And insurrection must be treated as an art. 
 I insisted on this during the Democratic Conference and I insist on itnow, because that is what Marxism teaches us, and it is what is being taught us by the present situation in Russiaand in the world generally. 
 It is not a question of voting, of attracting the Left So-cialist-Revolutionaries, of additional provincial Soviets,or of a congress of these Soviets. 
 It is a question of insurrec-tion, which can and must be decided by Petrograd, Moscow, Helsingfors, Kronstadt, Vyborg and Revel. 
 It is in the vicinity of Petrograd and in Petrograd itself that the insur-rection can, and must be decided on and effected, as ear-nestly as possible, with as much preparation as possible,as quickly as possible and as energetically as possible. 
 The fleet, Kronstadt, Vyborg, and Revel can and must advance on Petrograd; they can and must smash the Korni-lovite regiments, rouse both the capital cities, start a mass agitation for a government which will immediately give land to the peasants and immediately make proposals forpeace, overthrow Kerensky’s government and establishsuch a government. 
 Delay would be fatal.

(B.

 But this is impermissible if weare issuing the slogan of the seizure of power by the Soviets in all seriousness. 
 It is therefore high time to pay attention to the technical aspect of the question. 
 Apparently a lot oftime has already been lost. 
 Nevertheless the question is an urgent one, and the de-cisive moment is near. 
 The international situation is such that we must take the initiative. 
 What is being done to surrender territory as far as Narva, and to surrender Petrograd makes it still more imperativefor us to take decisive action. 
 The political situation is also working impressively in this direction. 
 Decisive action on our part on July 3, 4 and 5 would have failed because we did not have the majority behind us. 
 Since then we have made tremendous progress. 
 Absenteeism and indifference on the part of the masses is due to their being tired of words and resolutions. 
 We now have the majority behind us. 
 Politically, the situation is fully ripe for taking power. 
 The agrarian movement is also developing in that direc-tion, for it is obvious that extreme effort would be neededto stem that movement. 
 The slogan of the transfer of all land has become the general slogan of the peasants. 
 The political situation, therefore, is mature. 
 We must speak of the technical aspect. 
 That is the crux of the matter. 
 Nevertheless we, like the defencists, are inclined to regard thesystematic preparation of an uprising as something in thenature of a political sin. 
 It is senseless to wait for the Constituent Assembly that will obviously not be on our side, for this will only make our task more involved. 
 The regional congress and the proposal from Minsk 80 must be used for the beginning of decisive action. 
 First published in the magazine Published according Proletarskaya Revolutsia to the handwritten No. 
 10, 1922 copy of the Minutes 2 RESOLUTION The Central Committee recognises that the international position of the Russian revolution (the revolt in the German navy which is an extreme manifestation of the growth through-out Europe of the world socialist revolution; the threatof peace by the imperialists with the object of strangling therevolution in Russia) as well as the military situation (theindubitable decision of the Russian bourgeoisie and Ke-rensky and Co. 
 to surrender Petrograd to the Germans), and the fact that the proletarian party has gained a majority in the Soviets—all this, taken in conjunction with the peas-ant revolt and the swing of popular confidence towards ourParty (the elections in Moscow), and, finally, the obviouspreparations being made for a second Kornilov revolt (thewithdrawal of troops from Petrograd, the dispatch of Cos-sacks to Petrograd, the encircling of Minsk by Cossacks, etc. 
)—all this places the armed uprising on the order of theday. 
 Considering therefore that an armed uprising is inevit-able, and that the time for it is fully ripe, the Central Com-mittee instructs all Party organisations to be guided accord-ingly, and to discuss and decide all practical questions (the Congress of Soviets of the Northern Region, the with-drawal of troops from Petrograd, the action of our people inMoscow and Minsk, etc. 
) from this point of view.

P . 
(B. 
) OCTOBE R 10 (23), 191781 1 REPORT MINUTES Comrade Lenin read the resolution adopted by the Cen-tral Committee at the previous meeting. 
 He stated that the resolution had been adopted with two dissenting votes. 
 Ifthe dissident comrades wished to make a statement, a discussion could be held; meanwhile he continued with the motives of the resolution. 
 If the Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary parties were to break with their policy of conciliation, a compromisewith them could be proposed. 
 The proposal bad been made,but those parties had obviously rejected the compromise. 
 * On the other hand, by that time it had become definitelyclear that the masses were following the Bolsheviks. 
 Thathad been before the Kornilov revolt. 
 Lenin cited electionreturns from Petrograd and Moscow as evidence. 
 The Kor-nilov revolt had pushed the masses still more decisivelyto the side of the Bolsheviks. 
 The alignment of forces at the Democratic Conference. 
 The position was clear—either Kornilov’s dictatorship or the dictatorship of the prole-tariat and the poorer strata of the peasantry. 
 The Partycould not be guided by the temper of the masses becauseit was changeable and incalculable; the Party must be guid-ed by an objective analysis and an appraisal of the revolu-tion. 
 The masses had put their trust in the Bolsheviks and *See present edition, Vol.

 /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR demanded deeds from them and not words, a decisive policy both in the struggle against the war and in the struggle against economic ruin. 
 If the political analysis of the revo-lution were taken as the basis, it would be perfectly clearthat even anarchic outbursts confirmed that. 
 Lenin went onto analyse the situation in Europe and showed that revolution would be even more difficult inEurope than in Russia; if matters had gone as far as a revolt in the navy in such a country as Germany, there too they must already have gone very far. 
 Certain objective data onthe international situation showed that by acting at thatmoment the Bolsheviks would have all proletarian Europeon their side; he showed that the bourgeoisie wanted tosurrender Petrograd. 
 That could only be prevented by the Bolsheviks taking over Petrograd. 
 The obvious conclusion from all this was—the armed uprising was on the order ofthe day as was stated in the resolution of the Central Com-mittee. 
 It would be better to draw practical conclusions from the resolution after hearing the reports of representatives from the centres. 
 From a political analysis of the class struggle in Russia and in Europe there emerged the necessity to pursue themost determined and most active policy, which could beonly the armed uprising. 
 2 SPEECHES IN DISCUSSION MINUTES 1 Comrade Lenin argued against Milyutin and Schotmann and showed that it was not a matter of armed forces, thatit was not a question of fighting against the troops but ofone part of the army fighting against another. 
 He couldsee no pessimism in what had been said there. 
 He demonstrat-ed that the forces on the side of the bourgeoisie were small. 
 The facts showed that ours were superior to the enemy. 
 Why could the Central Committee not begin? There was no reasonthat derived from the facts. 
 To reject the resolution of the Central Committee it would have to be proved that there was no economic ruin and that the international situation would not lead to complications. 
 If trade union leaders were in favour of full power they knew very well what they wanted. 
Objective conditions showed that the peasantry must be led;they would follow the proletariat. 
 Some were afraid that Bolsheviks would not be able to maintain power, but at that moment there was a better chance than ever that they would be able to. 
 Lenin expressed the wish that the debate be confined to the substance of the resolution. 
 2 If all resolutions were defeated in that manner nothing better could be wished for. 
 Zinoviev was saying: do awaywith the “Power to the Soviets” slogan and bring pressureto bear on the government. 
 When it was said that the timewas ripe for insurrection there could be no question of con-spiracy. 
 Since an insurrection was inevitable politically, it must be regarded as an art. 
 Politically, an insurrection was due. 
 Because there was only enough bread for a day the Party could not wait for the Constituent Assembly. 
 ComradeLenin proposed that the resolution be approved, that ener-getic preparations be begun and that it be left to the Central Committee and the Soviet to decide when. 
 3 Comrade Lenin opposed Zinoviev, saying that the revo-lution could not be contrasted to the February revolution. 
 He proposed a resolution straight to the point. 
 3 RESOLUTION The meeting fully welcomes and fully supports the res-olution of the Central Committee and calls upon all orga-nisations and on workers and soldiers to make all-round,energetic preparations for an armed uprising and to support the centre set up for that purpose by the Central Committee; the meeting expresses its complete confidence that the Central Committee and the Soviet will indicate in good time the favourable moment and the most appropriate methods ofattack. 
 First published in the magazine Speeches published Proletarskaya Revolutsia according to a typewritten No. 
 10, 1927 copy of the Minutes; resolution according to the manuscript LETTER TO COMRADES Comrades, We are living in a time that is so critical, events are moving at such incredible speed that a publicist, placedby the will of fate somewhat aside from the mainstreamof history, constantly runs the risk either of being lateor proving uninformed, especially if some time elapsesbefore his writings appear in print. 
 Although I fully realise this, I must nevertheless address this letter to the Bolshe-viks, even at the risk of its not being published at all, forthe vacillations against which I deem it my duty to warnin the most decisive manner are of an unprecedented natureand may have a disastrous effect on the Party, the move-ment of the international proletariat, and the revolution. 
 As for the danger of being too late, I will prevent it by indi-cating the nature and date of the information I possess. 
 It was not until Monday morning, October 16, that I saw a comrade who had on the previous day participated ina very important Bolshevik gathering in Petrograd, and whoinformed me in detail of the discussion. 
 82 The subject of discussion was that same question of the uprising discussed by the Sunday papers of all political trends. 
 The gather-ing represented all that is most influential in all branchesof Bolshevik work in the capital. 
 Only a most insignifi-cant minority of the gathering, namely, all in all two com-rades, took a negative stand. 
 The arguments which those comrades advanced are so weak, they are a manifestation of such an astounding confusion, timidity, and collapse ofall the fundamental ideas of Bolshevism and proletarian revolutionary internationalism that it is not easy to dis-cover an explanation for such shameful vacillations. 
 The fact, however, remains, and since the revolutionary party has no right to tolerate vacillations on such a serious question,and since this pair of comrades, who have scattered theirprinciples to the winds, might cause some confusion, it isnecessary to analyse their arguments, to expose their vacil-lations, and to show how shameful they are. 
 The following lines are an attempt to do this. 
 “We have no majority among the people, and without this condi-tion the uprising is hopeless.... 
” People who can say this are either distorters of the truth or pedants who want an advance guarantee that through-out the whole country the Bolshevik Party has receivedexactly one-half of the votes plus one, this they want at allevents, without taking the least account of the real circum-stances of the revolution. 
 History has never given such a guarantee, and is quite unable to give it in any revolution. 
 To make such a demand is jeering at the audience, and isnothing but a cover to hide one’s own flight from reality. 
 For reality shows us clearly that it was after the July days that the majority of the people began quickly to goover to the side of the Bolsheviks. 
 This was demonstrated first by the August 20 elections in Petrograd, even before the Kornilov revolt, when the Bolshevik vote rose from 20to 33 per cent in the city not including the suburbs, and thenby the district council elections in Moscow in September,when the Bolshevik vote rose from 11 to 49. 
3 per cent (oneMoscow comrade, whom I saw recently, told me that the correct figure is 51 per cent). 
 This was proved by the new elections to the Soviets. 
 It was proved by the fact that amajority of the peasant Soviets, their “Avksentyev” centralSoviet notwithstanding, has expressed itself against the coalition . 
 To be against the coalition means in practice to follow the Bolsheviks. 
 Furthermore, reports from the front prove more frequently and more definitely that the soldiers are passing en masse over to the side or the Bolsheviks with ever greater determination, in spite of the malicious slan-ders and attacks by the Socialist-Revolutionary and Men-shevik leaders, officers, deputies, etc. 
, etc. 
 Last, but not least, the most outstanding fact of present-day Russian life is the revolt of the peasantry . 
 This shows objectively, not by words but by deeds, that the people aregoing over to the side of the Bolsheviks. 
 But the fact re-mains, notwithstanding the lies of the bourgeois press andits miserable yes-men of the “vacillating” Novaya Zhizn crowd, who shout about riots and anarchy. 
 The peasant move-ment in Tambov Gubernia 83 was an uprising both in the phys-ical and political sense, an uprising that has yielded suchsplendid political results as, in the first place, agreement totransfer the land to the peasants. 
 It is not for nothing that theSocialist-Revolutionary rabble, including Dyelo Naroda , who are frightened by the uprising, now scream about the need to transfer the land to the peasants. 
 Here is a practical demonstration of the correctness of Bolshevism and of itssuccess. 
 It proved to be impossible to “teach” the Bonapart-ists and their lackeys in the Pre-parliament otherwise thanby an uprising. 
 This is a fact and facts are stubborn things. 
 And such a factual “argument” in favour of an uprising is stronger than thousands of “pessimistic” evasions on the part of confusedand frightened politicians. 
 If the peasant uprising were not an event of nation-wide political import, the Socialist-Revolutionary lackeys from the Pre-parliament would not be shouting about the need to hand over the land to the peasants. 
 Another splendid political and revolutionary consequence of the peasant uprising, as already noted in Rabochy Put , is the delivery of grain to the railway stations in TambovGubernia. 
 Here is another “argument” for you, confused gentlemen, an argument in favour of the uprising as the only means to save the country from the famine that is knockingat our door and from a crisis of unheard-of dimensions. 
While the Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik betrayersof the people are grumbling, threatening, writing resolu-tions, promising to feed the hungry by convening the Con-stituent Assembly, the people are beginning to solve the bread problem Bolshevik-fashion , by rebelling against the landowners, capitalists, and speculators. 
 Even the bourgeois press, even Russkaya Volya , was compelled to admit the wonderful results of such a solution (the only real solution) of the bread problem, by publishing information to the effect that the railway stations in Tam-bov Gubernia were swamped with grain .... 
 And this after the peasants had revolted! To doubt now that the majority of the people are follow-ing and will follow the Bolsheviks is shameful vacillation and in practice is the abandoning of all the principles of proletarian revolutionism, the complete renunciation ofBolshevism. 
 “We are not strong enough to seize power, and the bourgeoisie is not strong enough to hinder the convening of the Constituent Assem-bly. 
” The first part of this argument is a simple paraphrase of the preceding one. 
 It does not gain in strength or power ofconviction, when the confusion of its authors and theirfear of the bourgeoisie are expressed in terms of pessimism in respect of the workers and optimism in respect of the bourgeoisie. 
 If the officer cadets and the Cossacks say thatthey will fight against the Bolsheviks to the last drop ofblood, this deserves full credence; if, however, the workersand soldiers at hundreds of meetings express full confidence inthe Bolsheviks and affirm their readiness to defend the trans-fer of power to the Soviets, then it is “timely” to recall that voting is one thing and fighting another! If you argue like that, of course, you “refute” the possi-bility of an uprising. 
 But, we may ask, in what way doesthis peculiarly orientated “pessimism” with its peculiar urgediffer from a political shift to the side of the bourgeoisie? Look at the facts. 
 Remember the Bolshevik declara-tions, repeated thousands of times and now “forgotten” byour pessimists. 
 We have said thousands of times that theSoviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies are a force, that they are the vanguard of the revolution, that they can take power. 
 Thousands of times have we upbraided theMensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries for phrase-monger-ing about the “plenipotentiary organs of democracy” accom-panied by fear to transfer power to the Soviets. 
 And what has the Kornilov revolt proved? It has proved that the Soviets are a real force. 
 And, now, after this has been proved by experience, by facts, we are expected to repudiate Bolshevism, denyourselves, and say that we are not strong enough (althoughthe Soviets of Petrograd and Moscow and a majority of theprovincial Soviets are on the side of the Bolsheviks)! Arethese not shameful vacillations? As a matter of fact, our “pessimists” are abandoning the slogan of “All Power to the Soviets”, though they are afraid to admit it. 
 How can it be proved that the bourgeoisie are not strong enough to hinder the calling of the Constituent Assembly? If the Soviets have not the strength to overthrow the bour-geoisie, this means the latter are strong enough to prevent the convocation of the Constituent Assembly, for there is nobody else to stop them. 
 To trust the promises of Kerenskyand Co. 
, to trust the resolutions of the servile Pre-par-liament—is this worthy of a member of a proletarian partyand a revolutionary? Not only has the bourgeoisie strength enough to hinder the convocation of the Constituent Assembly if the present government is not overthrown, but it can also achieve thisresult indirectly by surrendering Petrograd to the Germans, laying open the front, increasing lockouts, and sabotagingdeliveries of foodstuffs. 
 It has been proved by facts that the bourgeoisie have already been partly doing this, which means that they are capable of doing it to the full extent , if the work-ers and soldiers do not overthrow them. 
 “The Soviets must be a revolver pointed at the head of the govern-ment with the demand to convene the Constituent Assembly andstop all Kornilovite plots. 
” This is how far one of the two sad pessimists has gone. 
 He had to go that far, for to reject the uprising is the same as rejecting the slogan “All Power to the Soviets”. 
 Of course, a slogan is “not sacred”; we all agree to that. 
 But then why has no one raised the question of changing this slogan (in the same way as I raised the question after theJuly days *)? Why be afraid to say it openly, when the *See present edition, Vol. 
 25, pp. 
 185-92. 
— Ed. 
 Party, since September, has been discussing the question of the uprising, which is now the only way to realise the slogan “All Power to the Soviets”. 
 There is no way for our sad pessimists to turn. 
 A renuncia-tion of the uprising is a renunciation of the transfer of powerto the Soviets and implies a “transfer” of all hopes and expec-tations to the kind bourgeoisie, which has “promised” toconvoke the Constituent Assembly. 
 Is it so difficult to understand that once power is in the hands of the Soviets, the Constituent Assembly and its suc-cess are guaranteed ? The Bolsheviks have said so thousands of times and no one has ever attempted to refute it. 
 Every-body has recognised this “combined type”, but to smugglein a renunciation of the transfer of power to the Soviets under cover of the words “combined type”, to smuggle it in secretly while fearing to renounce our slogan openly is a matter for wonder. 
 Is there any parliamentary term todescribe it? Someone has very pointedly retorted to our pessimist: “Is it a revolver with no cartridges?” If so, it means going over directly to the Lieberdans, who have declared the Soviets a “revolver” thousands of times and have deceivedthe people thousands of times. 
 For while they were in control the Soviets proved to be worthless. 
 If, however, it is to be a revolver “with cartridges”, this cannot mean anything but technical preparation for an upris-ing; the cartridges have to be procured, the revolver has to be loaded—and cartridges alone will not be enough. 
 Either go over to the side of the Lieberdans and openly renounce the slogan “All Power to the Soviets”, or start theuprising. 
 There is no middle course. 
 “The bourgeoisie cannot surrender Petrograd to the Germans, although Rodzyanko wants to, for the fighting is done not by thebourgeoisie, but by our heroic sailors. 
” This argument again reduces itself to the same “opti-mism” in respect of the bourgeoisie which is fatally manifested at every step by those who are pessimistic about the revo-lutionary forces and capabilities of the proletariat. 
 The fighting is done by the heroic sailors, but this did not prevent two admirals from disappearing before the capture of Esel! That is a fact and facts are stubborn things. 
 The facts prove that admirals are capable of treachery no less than Kornilov. 
 It is an undisputed fact that Field Headquartershas not been reformed, and that the commanding staff isKornilovite in composition. 
 If the Kornilovites (with Kerensky at their head, for he is also a Kornilovite) want to surrender Petrograd, they can do it in two or even in three ways. 
 First, they can, through an act of treachery on the part of the Kornilovite officers, open the northern land front. 
 Second, they can “agree” on freedom of action for the entire German navy, which is stronger than we are; they can agree both with the German and the British imperialists. 
 Moreover, the admirals who have disappeared may havedelivered the plans to the Germans as well. 
 Third, they can, by means of lockouts, and by sabotag-ing the delivery of food, bring our troops to complete des-peration and impotence. 
 Not a single one of these three ways can be denied. 
 The facts have proved that the bourgeois-Cossack party of Rus-sia has already knocked at all three doors and has tried toforce open each of them. 
 What follows? It follows that we have no right to wait until the bourgeoisie strangle the revolution. 
 Experience has proved that Rodzyanko’s wishes are no trifle. 
 Rodzyanko is a man of affairs. 
 Rodzyanko is backedby capital . 
 This is beyond dispute. 
 Capital is tremendous strength as long as the proletariat do not have power. 
 For decades , Rodzyanko has faithfully and truly carried out the policies of capital. 
 What follows? It follows that to vacillate on the question of an uprising as the only means to save the revolutionmeans to sink into that cowardly credulity in the bourgeoi-sie which is half-Lieberdan, Socialist-Revolutionary-Men-shevik and half “peasant-like” unquestioning credulity,against which the Bolsheviks have been battling most of all. 
 Either fold your idle arms on your empty chest, wait and swear “faith” in the Constituent Assembly until Rod-zyanko and Co. 
 have surrendered Petrograd and strangled the revolution or start an uprising. 
 There is no middle course. 
 Even the convocation of the Constituent Assembly does not, in itself, change anything, for no “constituting”, no voting by any arch-sovereign assembly will have any effecton the famine, or on Wilhelm. 
 Both the convocation andthe success of the Constituent Assembly depend upon the transfer of power to the Soviets. 
 This old Bolshevik truthis being proved by reality ever more strikingly and ever more cruelly . 
 “We are becoming stronger every day. 
 We can enter the Constit-uent Assembly as a strong opposition; why should we stake every-thing?...” This is the argument of a philistine who has “read” that the Constituent Assembly is being called, and who trustingly acquiesces in the most legal, most loyal, most constitutionalcourse. 
 It is a pity, however, that waiting for the Constituent Assembly does not solve either the question of famine orthe question of surrendering Petrograd . 
 This “trifle” is forgotten by the naïve or the confused or those who have allowed themselves to be frightened. 
 The famine will not wait. 
 The peasant uprising did not wait. 
 The war will not wait. 
 The admirals who have disap-peared did not wait. 
 Will the famine agree to wait, because we Bolsheviks proclaim faith in the convocation of the Constituent As-sembly? Will the admirals who have disappeared agree towait? Will the Maklakovs and Rodzyankos agree to stopthe lockouts and the sabotaging of grain deliveries, or todenounce the secret treaties with the British and the Germanimperialists? This is what the arguments of the heroes of “constitutional illusions” and parliamentary cretinism amount to. 
 The liv-ing reality disappears, and what remains is only a paper dealing with the convocation of the Constituent Assembly;there is nothing left but to hold elections. 
 And blind people are still wondering why hungry people and soldiers betrayed by generals and admirals are indiffer-ent to the elections! Oh, wiseacres! “Were the Kornilovites to start again, we would show them! But why should we take risks and start? ” This is extraordinarily convincing and revolutionary. 
 History does not repeat itself, but if we turn our backs on it, contemplate the first Kornilov revolt and repeat:“If only the Kornilovites would start”—if we do that, whatexcellent revolutionary strategy it would be. 
 How muchlike a waiting game it is! Maybe the Kornilovites willstart again at an inopportune time. 
 Isn’t this a “weighty” argument? What kind of an earnest foundation for a prole-tarian policy is this? And what if the Kornilovites of the second draft will have learned a thing or two? What if they wait for the hunger riots to begin, for the front to be broken through, for Pet-rograd to be surrendered, before they begin ? What then? It is proposed that we build the tactics of the proletarian party on the possibility of the Kornilovites’ repeating oneof their old errors! Let us forget all that was being and has been demonstrated by the Bolsheviks a hundred times, all that the six months’history of our revolution has proved, namely, that there is no way out, that there is no objective way out and can be none except a dictatorship of the Kornilovites or a dictator-ship of the proletariat. 
 Let us forget this, let us renounce allthis and wait! Wait for what? Wait for a miracle, for thetempestuous and catastrophic course of events from April20 to August 29 to be succeeded (due to the prolongation of the war and the spread of famine) by a peaceful, quiet, smooth, legal convocation of the Constituent Assemblyand by a fulfilment of its most lawful decisions. 
 Here youhave the “Marxist” tactics! Wait, ye hungry! Kerensky haspromised to convene the Constituent Assembly. 
 “There is really nothing in the international situation that makes it obligatory for us to act immediately, we would be more likely to damage the cause of a socialist revolution in the West, if we were to allow ourselves to be shot.... 
” This argument is truly magnificent: Scheidemann “him-self”, Renaudel84 “himself” would not be able to “manipu-late” more cleverly the workers’ sympathies for the inter-national socialist revolution! Just think of it: under devilishly difficult conditions, having but one Liebknecht (and he in prison) with no news-papers, with no freedom of assembly, with no Soviets, withall classes of the population, including every well-to-do peasant, incredibly hostile to the idea of internationalism,with the imperialist big, middle, and petty bourgeoisie splendidly organised—the Germans, i. 
e. 
, the German revo-lutionary internationalists, the German workers dressed insailors’ jackets, started a mutiny in the navy with onechance in a hundred of winning. 
 But we, with dozens of papers at our disposal, freedom of assembly, a majority in the Soviets, we, the best situated proletarian internationalists in the world, should refuse to support the German revolutionaries by our uprising. 
 Weought to reason like the Scheidemanns and Renaudels, thatit is most prudent not to revolt, for if we are shot, then theworld will lose such excellent, reasonable, ideal internation-alists! Let us prove how reasonable we are. 
 Let us pass a resolu-tion of sympathy with the German insurrectionists , and let us renounce the insurrection in Russia. 
 This would be genuine, reasonable internationalism. 
 Imagine how fastworld internationalism would blossom forth, if the samewise policy were to triumph everywhere ! The war has fatigued and tormented the workers of all countries to the utmost. 
 Outbursts are becoming frequentin Italy, Germany and Austria. 
 We alone have Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies. 
 Let us then keep on waiting. 
 Let us betray the German internationalists as we are betray-ing the Russian peasants, who, not by words but by deeds, by their uprising against the landowners, appeal to us to rise against Kerensky’s government.... 
 Let the clouds of the imperialist conspiracy of the capitalists of all countries who are ready to strangle theRussian revolution gather—we shall wait patiently untilwe are strangled by the ruble ! Instead of attacking the con-spirators and breaking their ranks by a victory of the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies, let us wait for the Con-stituent Assembly, where all international plots will be vanquished by voting , provided Kerensky and Rodzyanko conscientiously convene the Constituent Assembly. 
 Have we any right to doubt the honesty of Kerensky and Rodzyanko? “But ‘everyone’ is against us! We are isolated; the Central Execu-tive Committee, the Menshevik internationalists, the Novaya Zhizn people, and the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries have been issuing andwill continue to issue appeals against us!” A crushing argument. 
 Up to now we have been merci-lessly scourging the vacillators for their vacillations. 
 By so doing , we have won the sympathies of the people. 
 By so doing , we have won over the Soviets, without which the uprising could not be safe, quick, and sure. 
 Now let us use the Soviets which we have won over in order to move into the camp of the vacillators . 
 What a splendid career for Bol-shevism! The whole essence of the policy of the Lieberdans and Chernovs, and also of the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, consists in vacillations . 
 The Left Social-ist-Revolutionaries and Menshevik internationalists havetremendous political importance as an indication of the fact that the masses are moving to the left . 
 Two such facts as the passing of some 40 per cent of both Mensheviks andSocialist-Revolutionaries into the camp of the Left, on the one hand, and the peasant uprising, on the other, are clearly and obviously interconnected. 
 But it is the very character of this connection that re-veals the abysmal spinelessness of those who have now under-taken to whimper over the fact that the Central ExecutiveCommittee, which has rotted away, or the vacillating Left Socialist-Revolutionaries and Co. 
, have come out against us. 
 For these vacillations of the petty-bourgeois leaders—the Martovs, Kamkovs, Sukhanovs and Co. 
—haveto be compared to the uprising of the peasants. 
 Here is a realistic political comparison. 
 With whom shall we go? Should it be with the vacillating handfuls of Petrograd lead-ers, who have expressed indirectly the leftward swing o f the masses, but who, at every political turn, have shamefully whimpered, vacillated, run to ask forgiveness of the Lieberdans, Avksentyevs and Co. 
, or with those masses that have moved to the left ? Thus, and only thus, can the question be presented. 
 Because the peasant uprising has been betrayed by the Martovs, Kamkovs, and Sukhanovs, we, the workers’party of revolutionary internationalists, are asked to betrayit, too. 
 This is what the policy of blaming the Left Social-ist-Revolutionaries and Menshevik internationalists re-duces itself to. 
 But we have said that to help the vacillating, we must stop vacillating ourselves. 
 Have those “nice” Left petty-bourgeois democrats not “vacillated” in favour of the coali-tion? In the long run we succeeded in making them followus because we ourselves did not vacillate. 
 Events have shown we are right. 
 These gentlemen by their vacillations have always held back the revolution; We alone have saved it. 
 Shallwe now give up, when the famine is knocking at the gatesof Petrograd and Rodzyanko and Co. 
 are preparing to sur-render the city?! “But we have not even firm connections with the railwaymen and the postal employees. 
 Their official representatives are the Plansons. 
 85 And can we win without the post office and without railways?” Yes, yes, the Plansons here, the Lieberdans there. 
 What confidence have the masses shown them? Have we not always shown that those leaders betrayed the masses ? Did the masses not turn away from those leaders towards us , both at the elections in Moscow and at the elections to the Soviets?Or perhaps the mass of railway and postal employees arenot starving! Or do not strike against Kerensky and Co. 
? “Did we have connections with these unions before Feb-ruary 28?” one comrade asked a pessimist. 
 The latter repliedby pointing out that the two revolutions could not be com-pared. 
 But this reply only strengthens the position of the one who asked the question. 
 For it is the Bolsheviks who havespoken thousands of times about prolonged preparation for the proletarian revolution against the bourgeoisie (and they have not spoken about it in order to forget their wordswhen the decisive moment is at hand). 
 The political and economic life of the unions of postal and telegraph employees and railwaymen is characterised by the very separation of the proletarian elements of the masses from the petty-bourgeois and bourgeois upper layer. 
 It is not absolutely necessaryto secure “connections” with one or the other union before-hand; what matters is that only a victory of a proletarianand peasant uprising can satisfy the masses both of the army of railwaymen and of postal and telegraph employees. 
 “There is only enough broad in Petrograd for two or three days. 
 Can we give bread to the insurrectionists?” This is one of a thousand sceptical remarks (the sceptics can always “doubt” and cannot be refuted by anything but experience), one of those remarks that put the blame on thewrong shoulders. 
 It is Rodzyanko and Co. 
, it is the bourgeoisie that are preparing the famine and speculating on strangling the revolu-tion by famine. 
 There is no escaping the famine and there can be none except by an uprising of the peasants against the landowners in the countryside and by a victory of theworkers over the capitalists in the cities and Petrogradand Moscow. 
 There is no other way to get grain from the rich, or to transport it despite their sabotage, or to break the resistance of the corrupt employees and thecapitalist profiteers, or to establish strict accounting. 
 Thehistory of the supply organisations and of the food difficultiesof the “democracy” with its millions of complaints against the sabotage of the capitalists, with its whimpering and supplication is proof of this. 
 There is no power on earth apart from the power of a victorious proletarian revolution that would advance fromcomplaints and begging and tears to revolutionary action . 
 And the longer the proletarian revolution is delayed, thelonger it is put off by events or by the vacillations of the wavering and confused, the more victims it will claim and the more difficult it will be to organise the transportation and distribution of food. 
 “In insurrection delay is fatal” this is our answer to those having the sad “courage” to look at the growing economicruin, at the approaching famine, and still dissuade the workers from the uprising ( that is , persuade them to wait and place confidence in the bourgeoisie for some further time ). 
 “There is not yet any danger at the front either. 
 Even if the soldiers conclude an armistice themselves, it is still not a calamity. 
” But the soldiers will not conclude an armistice. 
 For this state power is necessary and that cannot be obtainedwithout an uprising. 
 The soldiers will simply desert . 
 Reports from the front tell that. 
 We must not wait becauseof the risk of aiding collusion between Rodzyanko and Wilhelm and the risk of complete economic ruin, with the soldiers deserting in masses, once they ( being already close to desperation ) sink into absolute despair and leave everything to the mercy of fate. 
 “But if we take power, and obtain neither an armistice nor a demo-cratic peace, the soldiers may not be willing to fight a revolutionarywar. 
 What then?” An argument which brings to mind the saying: one fool can ask ten times more questions than ten wise men cananswer. 
 We have never denied the difficulties of those in power during an imperialist war. 
 Nevertheless, we have always preached the dictatorship of the proletariat and the poor peasantry. 
 Shall we renounce this, when the moment to acthas arrived? We have always said that the dictatorship of the prole-tariat in one country creates gigantic changes in the inter-national situation, in the economic life of the country, in the condition of the army and in its mood—shall we now“forget” all this, and allow ourselves to be frightened bythe “difficulties” of the revolution? “As everybody reports, the masses are not in a mood that would drive them into the streets. 
 Among the signs justifying pessimism maybe mentioned the greatly increasing circulation of the pogromist andBlack-Hundred press. 
” When people allow themselves to be frightened by the bourgeoisie, all objects and phenomena naturally appear yellow to them. 
 First, they substitute an impressionist, intellectualist criterion for the Marxist criterion of the movement; they substitute subjective impressions of moods for a political analysis of the development of the class struggleand of the course of events in the entire country againstthe entire international background. 
 They “conveniently”forget, of course, that a firm party line, its unyieldingresolve, is also a mood-creating factor , particularly at the sharpest revolutionary moments. 
 It is sometimes very “con-venient” for people to forget that the responsible leaders,by their vacillations and by their readiness to burn theiryesterday’s idols, cause the most unbecoming vacillationsin the mood of certain strata of the masses. 
 Secondly—and this is at present the main thing—in speaking about the mood of the masses, the spineless people forget to add: that “everybody” reports it as a tense and expectant mood;that “everybody” agrees that, called upon by the Soviets for the defence of the Soviets, the workers will rise to aman; that “everybody” agrees that the workers are greatly dissatisfied with the indecision of the centres concerning the“last decisive struggle”, the inevitability of which theyclearly recognise; that “everybody” unanimously characterises the mood of the broadest masses as close to desperation and points to the anarchy developing therefrom; that “everybody” also recognises that there is among the class-conscious workers a definite unwillingness to go outinto the streets only for demonstrations, only for partial struggles, since a general and not a partial struggle is in theair, while the hopelessness of individual strikes, demonstra-tions and acts to influence the authorities has been seen and is fully realised. 
 And so forth. 
If we approach this characterisation of the mass mood from the point of view of the entire development of the classand political struggle and of the entire course of events during the six months of our revolution, it will become clear to us how people frightened by the bourgeoisie aredistorting the question. 
 Things are not as they were before April 20-21, June 9, July 3, for then it was a matter of spontaneous excitement which we, as a party, either failed to comprehend (April 20) or held back and shaped into a peaceful demonstration (June 9 and July 3), for we knewvery well at that time that the Soviets were not yet ours, that the peasants still trusted the Lieberdan-Chernov and not the Bolshevik course (uprising), that consequently wecould not have the majority of the people behind us, and that consequently the uprising would be premature. 
 At that time the majority of the class-conscious workers did not raise the question of the last decisive struggle at all; not one of all our Party units would have raised it at thattime. 
 As for the unenlightened and very broad masses,there was neither a concerted effort nor the resolve born out of despair; there was only a spontaneous excitement with the naïve hope of “influencing” Kerensky and the bourgeoisieby “action”, by a demonstration pure and simple. 
 What is needed for an uprising is not this, but, on the one hand, a conscious, firm and unswerving resolve on thepart of the class-conscious elements to fight to the end; and on the other, a mood of despair among the broad masses who feel that nothing can now be saved by half-measures; that you cannot “influence” anybody; that the hungry will“smash everything, destroy everything, even anarchically”,if the Bolsheviks are not able to lead them in a decisive battle. 
 The development of the revolution has in practice brought both the workers and the peasantry to precisely this combi-nation of a tense mood resulting from experience among theclass-conscious and a mood of hatred towards those usingthe lockout weapon and the capitalists that is close todespair among the broadest masses. 
 We can also understand the “success” on this very soil of the scoundrels of the reactionary press who imitate Bol-shevism. 
 The malicious glee of the reactionaries at theapproach of a decisive battle between the bourgeoisie andthe proletariat has been observed in all revolutions withoutexception; it has always been so, and it is absolutely unavoid-able. 
 And if you allow yourselves to be frightened by this circumstance, then you have to renounce not only the upris-ing but the proletarian revolution in general. 
 For in a cap-italist society this revolution cannot mature without being accompanied by malicious glee on the part of the reaction-aries and by hopes that they would be able to feather their nest in this way. 
 The class-conscious workers know perfectly well that the Black Hundreds work hand in hand with the bourgeoi-sie, and that a decisive victory of the workers (in which thepetty bourgeoisie do not believe, which the capitalists are afraid of, which the Black Hundreds sometimes wish for out of sheer malice, convinced as they are that the Bolshe-viks cannot retain power)—that this victory will completelycrush the Black Hundreds, that the Bolsheviks will be able to retain power firmly and to the greatest advantage of allhumanity tortured and tormented by the war. 
 Indeed, is there anybody in his senses who can doubt that the Rodzyankos and Suvorins are acting in concert, that the roles have been distributed among them? Has it not been proved by facts that Kerensky acts on Rodzyanko’s orders, while the State Printing Press of theRussian Republic (don’t laugh!) prints the Black-Hundred speeches of reactionaries in the “Duma” at the expense of the state. 
 Has not this fact been exposed even by the lackeys from Dyelo Naroda , who serve “their own mannikin”? Has not the experience of all elections proved that the Cadet lists were fully supported by Novoye Vremya , which is a venal paper controlled by the “interests” of the tsarist landowners? 86 Did we not read yesterday that commercial and industrial capitalists (non-partisan capitalists, of course; oh, non-par-tisan capitalists, to be sure, for the Vikhlayevs and Rakitni-kovs, the Gvozdyovs and Nikitins are not in coalitionwith the Cadets—God forbid—but with non-partisan com-mercial and industrial circles!) have donated the goodly sum of 300,000 rubles to the Cadets? The whole Black-Hundred press, if we look at things from a class and not a sentimental point of view, is a branch of the firm “Ryabushinsky, Milyukov, and Co. 
”. 
 Capitalistsbuy, on the one hand, the Milyukovs, Zaslavskys, Potresovs,and so on; on the other, the Black Hundreds. 
 The victory of the proletariat is the only means of putting an end to this most hideous poisoning of the people by thecheap Black-Hundred venom. 
 Is it any wonder that the crowd, tired out and made wretched by hunger and the prolongation of the war, clutches at the Black-Hundred poison? Can one imagine a capitalist society on the eve of collapse in which the oppressed massesare not desperate? Is there any doubt that the desperation of the masses, a large part of whom are still ignorant, will express itself in the increased consumption of all sorts ofpoison? Those who, in arguing about the mood of the masses, blame the masses for their own personal spinelessness, arein a hopeless position. 
 The masses are divided into thosewho are consciously biding their time and those who uncon-sciously are ready to sink into despair; but the masses of theoppressed and the hungry are not spineless. 
 “On the other hand, the Marxist party cannot reduce the question of an uprising to that of a military conspiracy.... 
” Marxism is an extremely profound and many-sided doc-trine. 
 It is, therefore, no wonder that scraps of quotations from Marx—especially when the quotations are made inap-propriately —can always be found among the “arguments” of those who break with Marxism. 
 Military conspiracy isBlanquism, if it is organised not by a party of a definite class, if its organisers have not analysed the political moment in general and the international situation in particular, if the party has not on its side the sympathy of the majority of the people, as proved by objective facts, if the develop-ment of revolutionary events has not brought about a practi-cal refutation of the conciliatory illusions of the pettybourgeoisie, if the majority of the Soviet-type organs of revolutionary struggle that have been recognised as authori-tative or have shown themselves to be such in practice have not been won over, if there has not matured a sentiment in the army (if in war-time) against the government that protractsthe unjust war against the will of the whole people, if the slogans of the uprising (like “All power to the Soviets”,“Land to the peasants”, or “Immediate offer of a democratic peace to all the belligerent nations, with an immediate abrogation of all secret treaties and secret diplomacy”, etc. 
)have not become widely known and popular, if the advanced workers are not sure of the desperate situation of the masses and of the support of the countryside, a support proved by a serious peasant movement or by an uprising against the landowners and the government that defends the landowners,if the country’s economic situation inspires earnest hopes for a favourable solution of the crisis by peaceable and parlia-mentary means. 
 This is probably enough. 
 In my pamphlet entitled: Can the Bolsheviks Retain State Power? (I hope it will appear in a day or two), there is a quotation from Marx which really bears upon the questionof insurrection and which enumerates the features of insur-rection as an “art”. 
 * I am ready to wager that if we were to propose to all those chatterers in Russia who are now shouting against a military conspiracy, to open their mouths and explain thedifference between the “art” of an insurrection and a militaryconspiracy that deserves condemnation, they would eitherrepeat what was quoted above or would cover themselveswith shame and would call forth the general ridicule of the workers. 
 Why not try, my dear would-be Marxists! Sing us a song against “military conspiracy”! *See pp.

 POSTSCRIPT The above lines had been written when I received, at eight o’clock Tuesday evening, the morning Petrograd papers; there was an article by Mr. 
 V. 
 Bazarov in Novaya Zhizn . 
 Mr. 
 V. 
 Bazarov asserts that “a handwritten mani-festo was distributed in the city, in which arguments werepresented in the name of two eminent Bolsheviks, againstimmediate action”. 
 If this is true, I beg the comrades, whom this letter cannot reach earlier than Wednesday noon, to publish it as quickly as possible. 
 I did not write it for the press; I wanted to talk to the mem-bers of our Party by letter. 
 But we cannot remain silent whenthe heroes of Novaya Zhizn , who do not belong to the Party and who have been ridiculed by it a thousand times for their contemptible spinelessness (they voted for the Bolsheviks the day before yesterday, for the Mensheviks yesterday, andwho almost united them at the world-famous unity congress) —when such individuals receive a manifesto from members of our Party in which they carry on propaganda against anuprising. 
 We must agitate also in favour of an uprising. 
 Let the anonymous individuals come right out into the light of day, and let them bear the punishment they deserve fortheir shameful vacillations, even if it be only the ridiculeof all class-conscious workers. 
 I have at my disposal onlyone hour before I send the present letter to Petrograd, and Itherefore can say only a word or two about one of the “methods” of the sad heroes of the brainless Novaya Zhizn trend. 
 Mr. 
 V. 
 Bazarov attempts to polemise against ComradeRyazanov, who has said, and who is a thousand times correct in saying, that “all those who create in the masses a mood of despair and indifference are preparing an uprising”. 
 The sad hero of a sad cause “rejoins” as follows: “Have despair and indifference ever conquered?” O contemptible fools from Novaya Zhizn ! Do they know such examples of uprising in history, in which the masses ofthe oppressed classes were victorious in a desperate battle without having been reduced to despair by long sufferings and by an extreme sharpening of all sorts of crises, in whichthose masses had not been seized by indifference towardsvarious lackey-like pre-parliaments, towards idle playingat revolution, towards the Lieberdans’ reduction of theSoviets from organs of power and uprising to empty talking-shops? Or have the contemptible little fools from Novaya Zhizn perhaps discovered among the masses an indifference —to the question of bread, to the prolongation of the war, toand for the peasants? Written on October 17 (30), 1917 Published in Rabochy Put Published according Nos. 
 40, 41 and 42, November 1, 2 and to the newspaper text 3 (October 19, 20 and 21), 1917 Signed: N. 
 Lenin LETTE R TO BOLSHEVI K PARTY MEMBER S87 Comrades, I have not yet been able to obtain the Petrograd papers for Wednesday, October 18. 
 When the full text of Kamenev’s and Zinoviev’s statement in the non-Party paper Novaya Zhizn was transmitted to me by telephone, I refused to believe it. 
 But, as it has turned out, there can be no doubt about it and I have to avail myself of this opportunity to get a letter to Party members by Thursday evening or Fridaymorning; for to remain silent in the face of such unheard-ofstrike-breaking would be a crime. 
 The more serious the practical problem, and the more responsible and “prominent” the persons guilty of strike-breaking, the more dangerous it is, the more resolutely must the strike-breakers be kicked out, and the moreunpardonable would it be to stop even to consider thepast “services” of the strike-breakers. 
 Just think of it! It has been known in Party circles that the Party has been discussing the question of an insurrection since September. 
 Nobody has ever heard of a single letter or manifesto by either of the persons named! Now, on the eve,one might say, of the Congress of Soviets, two prominentBolsheviks come out against the majority, and, obviously, against the Central Committee . 
 It is not said plainly, but the harm done to the cause is all the greater, for to speak in hints is even more dangerous. 
 It is perfectly clear from the text of Kamenev’s and Zinoviev’s statement that they have gone against the Central Committee, for otherwise their statement would be meaning-less. 
 But they do not say what specific decision of the Central Committee they are disputing. 
 Why?The reason is obvious: because it has not been published by the Central Committee. 
 What does this boil down to?On a burning question of supreme importance, on the eve of the critical day of October 20, two “prominent Bolsheviks” attack an unpublished decision of the Party centre and attack it in the non-Party press and, furthermore; in a paper which on this very question is hand in glove with the bourgeoisie against the workers ’ party ! This is a thousand times more despicable and a million times more harmful than all the statements Plekhanov, for example, made in the non-Party press in 1906-07, andwhich the Party so sharply condemned! At that time it wasonly a question of elections, whereas now it is a questionof an insurrection for the conquest of power! On such a question, after a decision has been taken by the centre, to dispute this unpublished decision in front of the Rodzyankos and Kerenskys in a non-Party paper—canyou imagine an act more treacherous or blackleggingany worse? I should consider it disgraceful on my part if I were to hesitate to condemn these former comrades because of my earlier close relations with them. 
 I declare outright that I no longer consider either of them comrades and that I willfight with all my might, both in the Central Committeeand at the Congress, to secure the expulsion of both of themfrom the Party. 
 A workers’ party, which the course of events is confronting more and more frequently with the need for an insurrection, is unable to accomplish that difficult task if, after theiradoption, unpublished decisions of the centre are disputedin the non-Party press, and vacillation and confusion arebrought into the ranks of the fighters. 
 Let Mr. 
 Zinoviev and Mr. 
 Kamenev found their own party with the dozens of perplexed people or with candidates for election to the Constituent Assembly. 
 The workers will notjoin such a party, for its first slogan will be: “Members of the Central Committee who are defeated at a meeting of the Central Committee on the question of a decisive fight are permitted to resort to the non-Party press for the purpose of attacking the unpublisheddecisions of the Party. 
” Let them build themselves such a party; our workers’ Bolshevik Party will only gain from it. 
 When all the documents are published, the strike-break-ing act of Zinoviev and Kamenev will stand out even moreglaringly. 
 Meanwhile, let the workers consider the follow-ing question: ‘Let us assume that the Executive Committee of an all-Russia trade union had decided, after a month of deliberation and by a majority of over 80 per cent,that preparations must be made for a strike, but thatfor the time being neither the date nor any otherdetails should be divulged. 
 Let us assume that, after the decision had been taken, two members, under the false pretext of a “dissenting opinion”, not only began to write to local groups urging a reconsideration ofthe decision, but also permitted their letters to becommunicated to non-Party newspapers. 
 Let us assume, finally, that they themselves attacked the decision innon-Party papers, although it had not yet been pub-lished, and began to vilify the strike in front of the capitalists. 
 ‘We ask, would the workers hesitate to expel such blacklegs from their midst?’ * * * As to the situation with regard to an insurrection now, when October 20 is so close at hand, I cannot judge from afar towhat exact extent the cause has been damaged by the strike-breaking statement in the non-Party press. 
 There is nodoubt that very great practical damage has been done. 
 In order to remedy the situation, it is necessary first of all to restore unity in the Bolshevik front by expelling theblacklegs. 
 The weakness of the ideological arguments against an insurrection will become clearer, the more we drag them into the light of day. 
 I recently sent an article on this subject to Rabochy Put , and if the editors do not find it possible to print it, Party members will probably acquaint themselveswith it in the manuscript. 
 * There are basically two so-called “ideological” arguments. 
 First, that it is necessary to “wait” for the Constituent Assembly. 
 Let us wait, perhaps we can hold on until then— hat is the whole argument. 
 Perhaps, despite famine, despiteeconomic chaos, despite the fact that the patience of thesoldiers is exhausted, despite Rodzyanko’s steps to surrenderPetrograd to the Germans, despite the lockouts, perhaps wecan hold on. 
 Perhaps and maybe—that is the whole point of the argu-ment. 
 The second is noisy pessimism. 
 Everything is fine with the bourgeoisie and Kerensky; everything is wrong with us. 
The capitalists have prepared everything wonderfully;everything is wrong with the workers. 
 The “pessimists” are shouting at the top of their voices about the military side of the matter, but the “optimists” are silent, for to disclosecertain things to Rodzyanko and Kerensky is hardly pleas-ant to anybody but blacklegs. 
 Difficult times. 
 A hard task. 
 A grave betrayal. 
 Nevertheless, the task will be accomplished; the workers will consolidate their ranks, the peasant revolt and theextreme impatience of the soldiers at the front will do theirwork! Let us close our ranks—the proletariat must win! N.

 THE TASKS OF OUR PARTY IN THE INTERNATIONAL APROPOS OF THE THIRD ZIMMERWALD CONFERENCE88 Rabochy Put No. 
 22 of September 28 published the mani-festo of the Third Zimmerwald Conference. 
 If we are not mistaken, the only other newspaper that published this man-ifesto was the Menshevik, internationalist Iskra 89 No. 
 1 of September 26, which added a very brief note referringto the composition of the Third Zimmerwald Conferenceand the date on which it was held (August 20 to 27, N. 
 S. 
). 
 No other newspaper published either the manifesto or any detailed information about the Conference. 
 We are now in possession of certain materials on this Conference consisting of an article published in Politiken , the organ of the Swedish Left Social-Democrats (a translationof which appeared in Työmies , the organ of the Social-Democratic Party of Finland) 90 and two written communica-tions, one from a Polish and one from a Russian comradewho took part in the Conference. 
 On the basis of this informa-tion we will first of all say something about the Conferencein general and then make our appraisal of it and of thetasks of our Party. 
 I The representatives of the following parties and groups were present at the Conference: (1) the German “Independent”Social-Democratic Party (the Kautskyites); (2) the Swissparty; (3) the Swedish Left party (which, you will remember, has broken off all connection with the opportunist Branting party); (4) the Norwegians and (5) the Danes (there is nothingin our material to indicate whether this refers to the official, opportunist, Danish party headed by the Minister Staun-ing); (6) the Social-Democratic Party of Finland; (7) the Rumanians; (8) the R.

 From this it is soon that the composition of the Confer-ence was very mixed—even absurd, for the people who got together were not in agreement on the main thing, and there-fore were incapable of really unanimous action, of really acting together; they were people who were bound to dis-agree on the fundamental trend of their policy. 
 Naturally, the fruit of the “collaboration” of such people is either wran-gling or gossip, or elastic, compromise resolutions written for the purpose of concealing the truth.

 LETTER TO THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 (B. 
) Dear Comrades, No self-respecting party can tolerate strike-breaking and blacklegs in its midst. 
 That is obvious. 
 The more wereflect upon Zinoviev’s and Kamenev’s statement in thenon-Party press, the more self-evident it becomes that theiraction is strike-breaking in the full sense of the term. 
 Kame-nev’s evasion at the meeting of the Petrograd Soviet is something really despicable. 
 He is, don’t you see, in full agreement with Trotsky. 
 But is it so difficult to understandthat in the face of the enemy, Trotsky could not have said, he had no right to say, and should not have said more thanhe did? Is it so difficult to understand that it is a duty to the Party which has concealed its decision from the enemy (on the necessity for an armed uprising, on the fact that the time for it is fully ripe, on the thorough preparations to bemade for it, etc. 
), and it is this decision that makes it obliga-tory in public statements to fasten not only the “blame”, but also the initiative upon the adversary? Only a child could failto understand that. 
 Kamenev’s evasion is a sheer fraud. 
 The same must be said of Zinoviev’s evasion, at least of his letter of “justification” (written, I think, to the Central Organ),which is the only document I have seen (for, as to a dissent-ing opinion, “an alleged dissenting opinion”, which hasbeen trumpeted in the bourgeois press, I, a member of the Central Committee, have to this very day seen nothing of it). 
 Among Zinoviev’s “arguments” there is this: Lenin, he says, sent out his letters “ before any decisions were adopted”, and you did not protest. 
 That is literally what Zinoviev wrote, himself underlining the word before four times. 
 Is it really so difficult to understand that before a decision has been taken on a strike by the centre, it is permissible to agitate for and against it; but that after a decision in favour of a strike (with the additional decision to conceal thisfrom the enemy), to carry on agitation against the strikeis strike-breaking? Any worker will understand that. 
 Thequestion of insurrection has been discussed in the centre since September. 
 That is when Zinoviev and Kamenev could and should have come out in writing, so that everybody , upon seeing their arguments, would have realised that they hadcompletely lost their heads. 
 To conceal one’s views fromthe Party for a whole month before a decision is taken, and to send out a dissenting opinion after a decision is taken— that is strike-breaking. 
 Zinoviev pretends not to understand this difference, he pretends not to understand that after a decision to strikehas been taken by the centre, only blacklegs can carry onagitation among the lower bodies against that decision. 
Any worker will understand that. 
 And Zinoviev did agitate and attempted to defeat the centre’s decision, both at Sunday’s meeting, 93 where he and Kamenev secured not a single vote, and in his present letter. 
For Zinoviev has the effrontery to assert that “the opinionof the Party has not been canvassed” and that such questions“cannot be decided by ten men”. 
 Just think! Every member of the Central Committee knows that more than ten C. 
C. 
 members were present at the decisive meeting, that a majority of the plenary meeting were present, that Kamenev himself declared at the meeting that “this meeting is decisive”,that it was known with absolute certainty that the majority of the absent members of the Central Committee were not in agreement with Zinoviev and Kamenev. 
 And now, after the Central Committee has adopted a decision at a meetingwhich Kamenev himself admitted to be decisive , a member of the Central Committee has the audacity to write that “theopinion of the Party has not been canvassed”, and that suchquestions “cannot be decided by ten men”. 
 That is strike-break-ing in the full sense of the term. 
 Between Party congresses, the Central Committee decides. 
 The Central Committee hasdecided. 
 Kamenev and Zinoviev, who did not come out in writing before the decision was taken, began to dispute the Central Committee’s decision after it had been taken. 
 That is strike-breaking in the full sense of the term. 
 After a decision has been taken, any dispute is impermissible when it concerns immediate and secret preparations for a strike. 
 Now Zinoviev has the insolence to blame us for “warning the enemy”. 
 Is there any limit to his brazenness?Who is it that has damaged the cause, frustrated the strike by “warning the enemy”, if not those who came out in the non-Party press? How can one come out against a “decisive” resolution of the Party in a paper which on this question is band in glove with the entire bourgeoisie? If that is tolerated, the Party will become impossible, the Party will be destroyed. 
 It is ridiculing the Party to give the name of “dissenting opinion” to that which Bazarov learns about and publishesin a non-Party paper. 
 Kamenev’s and Zinoviev’s statement in the non-Party press was especially despicable for the additional reason that the Party is not in a position to refute their slanderous lie openly. 
 I know of no decisions regarding the date, Kame-nev writes and publishes his writings in his own name andin the name of Zinoviev. 
 (After such a statement, Zinovievbears full responsibility for Kamenev’s conduct and state-ments. 
) How can the Central Committee refute this? We cannot tell the capitalists the truth, namely, that we have decided on a strike and have decided to conceal the moment chosen for it. 
 We cannot refute the slanderous lie of Zinoviev and Kamenev without doing even greater damage to the cause . 
 And the utter baseness, the real treachery of these two individuals is precisely in their having revealed thestrikers’ plan to the capitalists, for, since we remain silentin the press, everybody will guess how things stand. 
 Kamenev and Zinoviev have betrayed to Rodzyanko and Kerensky the decision of the Central Committee of their Party on insurrection and the decision to conceal from the enemy preparations for insurrection and the date appointedfor it. 
 That is a fact and no evasions can refute it. 
 Two mem-bers of the Central Committee have by a slanderous lie betrayed the decision of the workers to the capitalists. 
 There can and must be only one answer to that: an immediate decision of the Central Committee: “The Central Committee, regarding Zinoviev’s and Kame-nev’s statement in the non-Party press as strike-breakingin the full sense of the term, expels both of them from theParty. 
” It is not easy for me to write in this way about former close comrades. 
 But I should regard any hesitation in thisrespect as a crime, for otherwise a party of revolutionarieswhich does not punish prominent blacklegs would perish . 
 The question of insurrection, even if the blacklegs have now delayed it for a long time by betraying it to Rodzyanko and Kerensky, has not been removed from the agenda , it has not been removed by the Party. 
 But how can we prepareourselves for insurrection and lay plans for it, if we tolerate “prominent” strike-breakers in our midst? The more prom-inent, the more dangerous they are, and the less deserving of “forgiveness”. 
 On n ’est trahi que par les siens , the French say. 
 Only your own people can betray you. 
 The more “ prominent ” the strike-breakers are, the more imperative it is to punish them by immediate expulsion. 
 That is the only way for the workers’ party to recuperate, rid itself of a dozen or so spineless intellectuals, rally theranks of the revolutionaries, and advance to meet great and momentous difficulties hand in hand with the revolutionary workers. 
 We cannot publish the truth, namely, that after the deci-sive meeting of the Central Committee, Zinoviev and Kame-nev at Sunday’s meeting had the audacity to demand arevision , that Kamenev had the effrontery to shout: “The Central Committee has collapsed, for it has done nothing for a whole week” (I could not refute that because to say what really had been done was impossible), while Zinoviev with an air of innocence proposed this resolution, which wasrejected by the meeting: “No action shall be taken beforeconsulting with the Bolsheviks who are to arrive on October 20 for the Congress of Soviets. 
” Just imagine! After the centre has taken a decision to call a strike, it is proposed at a meeting of the rank and file that it be postponed (until October 20, when the Congress was to convene. 
 The Congress was subsequently postponed— the Zinovievs trust the Lieberdans) and be referred to a body such as the Party Rules do not provide for, that has no authority over the Central Committee, and that does not know Petrograd. 
 And after this Zinoviev still has the insolence to write: “This is hardly the way to strengthen the unity of the Party. 
” What else can you call it but a threat to effect a split? My answer to this threat is that I shall go the limit, I shall win freedom of speech for myself before the workers,and I shall, at whatever cost , brand the blackleg Zinoviev as a blackleg. 
 My answer to the threat of a split is to declarewar to a finish, war for the expulsion of both blacklegs from the Party. 
 The Executive Committee of a trade union, after a month of deliberation, decides that a strike is inevitable, thatthe time is ripe, but that the date is to be concealed from theemployers. 
 After that, two members of the ExecutiveCommittee appeal to the rank and file , disputing the decision, and are defeated. 
 Thereupon these two come out in the press and with a slanderous lie betray the decision of the ExecutiveCommittee to the capitalists, thus more than half wreckingthe strike, or delaying it to a less favourable time by warningthe enemy. 
 Here we have strike-breaking in the full sense of the term. 
 And that is why I demand the expulsion of both the black-legs, reserving for myself the right (in view of their threatof a split) to publish everything when publication becomes possible. 
 Written on October 19 (November 1), 1917 First published on November 1, Published according 1927 in Pravda No. 
 250 to a typewritten copy SOCIALIST -REVOLUTIONARY PARTY CHEATS THE PEASANTS ONCE AGAIN The Socialist-Revolutionary Party has made a solemn and public announcement, in its chief newspaper, Dyelo Naroda , of October 18 and 19, that the Minister of Agricul-ture’s new land bill is a “major step towards the implementa-tion of the Party’s agrarian programme”, and that the“Party’s Central Committee insistently urges all Partyorganisations to launch a vigorous campaign in favour of the bill and popularise it among the masses”. 
 Actually, however, this bill, produced by the Minister, S. 
 L. 
 Maslov, who is a member of the Socialist-Revolution-ary Party, and summarised in Dyelo Naroda , is a fraud on the peasants . 
 The S. 
R. 
 Party has deceived the peasants: it has crawled away from its own land bill and has adopted the plan of the landowners and Cadets for a “fair assessment” and preservation of landed proprietorship. 
 At its congressesduring the first Russian revolution (1905) and the secondRussian revolution (1917), the S. 
R. 
 Party solemnly andpublicly committed itself to the peasant demand for con-fiscation of the landed estates, that is, for their transfer to the peasants without compensation . 
 Under Mr. 
 Maslov’s present project, however, not only are the landed estatesleft intact but the landlords are also to get the “fairly” assessed rent paid by the peasants for the “leased” lands. 
 This bill of Mr. 
 Maslov’s is downright betrayal of the peasants by the S. 
R. 
 Party, and signifies its complete subservience to the landed proprietors. 
 The utmost must be done, every effort must be made to drive this fact home tothe widest possible sections of peasants. 
 On October 18, Dyelo Naroda carried Clauses 25-40 of Maslov’s bill. 
 Here are its main points: (1)Not all landed estates are to go into the proposed “provisional lease pool”. 
 (2) Landed estates are pooled by land committees set up under the law of April 21, 1917, which was issued by PrinceLvov’s government of landed proprietors . 
 (3) The rent paid by the peasants for these tracts is to be fixed by the land committees “in accordance with the net income” and after deduction of various payments goes tothe “rightful owner”, that is , the landed proprietor. 
 This is a triple fraud worked on the peasants by the Socialist-Revolutionaries, and each of these three pointsmust be dealt with in greater detail. 
 Izvestia Vserossiiskogo Soveta Krestyanskikh Deputatov No. 
 88, dated August 19, carries a “model mandate drawnup on the basis of 242 mandates submitted by deputies fromvarious localities to the First All-Russia Congress of Sovietsof Peasants’ Deputies held in Petrograd in 1917”. 
 This summary of 242 mandates , made by representatives of peasants in the localities, gives the best idea of what the peasants want . 
 This summarised mandate shows very well that the project of Maslov and the S. 
R. 
 Party isa swindle. 
 The peasants are demanding the abolition of the right to private ownership of land; the conversion of all private land holdings, etc. 
, into the property of the whole people, without compensation; the conversion of land tracts farmedon a highly efficient level (orchards, plantations, etc. 
)into “model farms”, their transfer to “the exclusive use ofthe state and the communes”; the confiscation of “ all live-stock and farm implements”, etc. 
 Such is the clear-cut statement of the peasant demands based on 242 local mandates submitted by the peasantsthemselves. 
 But the S. 
R. 
 Party, having entered “a coalition” (that is, an alliance or agreement) with the bourgeoisie (the capital-ists) and the landowners, and taking part in the govern-ment of capitalists and landowners, has now produced a bill which does not abolish landed property but transfers only a part of the landed estates into a provisional lease pool . 
 Under the bill, no orchards, plantations, beet fields, etc. 
, can go into the lease pool! Nor can the pool include lands required “to satisfy the needs of the owner, his family, employ-ees and workers, or to ensure the maintenance of availablelivestock”! This means that the great landowner who has a sugar refinery, a potato processing plant, oil or other mill, or-chards and plantations, hundreds of head of cattle and dozens of employees and workers, is to retain a great estate farmed on capitalist lines . 
 The S. 
R. 
 Party has indeed cheated the peasants with exceptional brazenness. 
 Landed estates, or “privately held land”, as the bill puts it, are to be transferred to the lease pool by land com-mittees set up under the law of April 21, 1917, by the govern-ment of landed proprietors headed by Prince Lvov and Co. 
, the selfsame government of Milyukov and Guchkov, theimperialists and plunderers of the masses, who were routedby the workers’ and soldiers’ movement in Petrograd onApril 20 and 21, i. 
e. 
, a full six months ago. 
 The land committee law issued by this government of landed proprietors is, of course, far from being a democratic (popular) law. 
 On the contrary, it contains a whole series ofoutrageous departures from democracy. 
 Take its Clause 11,which gives the “gubernia * land committees the right to suspend decisions of the volost and uyezd committees, pend-ing a final ruling by the central land committee”. 
 Under this swindling landowners’ law, the committees are so consti-tuted that the uyezd committee is less democratic thanthe volost committee, the gubernia committee is less demo-cratic than the uyezd committee, and the central committeeis less democratic than the gubernia committee. 
 The volost land committee is entirely elected by the popu-lation of the volost. 
 Under the law, for instance, the uyezd committee must include the local magistrate and five mem-bers of “provisional executive committees” (pending the *Gubernia , uyezd , volost —Russian administrative territorial units. 
 The largest of these was the gubernia, divided into uyezds, which inturn were subdivided into volosts. 
 This system continued underSoviet power until the introduction of the new system of administra-tive territorial divisions in 1929-30. 
— Ed. 
 establishment of a new local government body). 
 The gubernia committee includes a member of the circuit court and a mag-istrate, and also a representative of the ministry who is appointed by the minister, etc. 
 The central land committee consists of 27 members “invited to sit on it by the Provision-al Government”! This includes one each from the 11 polit-ical parties, with the majority (6 out of 11) going to the Cadets and those to the right of them . 
 Isn’t this an obvious swindle on the part of Lvov, Shingaryov (who signed the bill) and their friends? Isn’t this simply flouting democracyto please the landed proprietors? Does this not bear out the repeated Bolshevik statement that the will of the peasantry can be correctly expressedand implemented only by the Soviets of Peasants ’ Deputies , elected by the mass of working people and subject to recall at any time? The Socialist-Revolutionaries, who were returned in a majority to the All-Russia Executive Committee of theSoviets of Peasants’ Deputies by the unsuspecting peasants,have now betrayed them; they have sold out the peasant Soviets, gone over to the landowners , and accepted the land committee law of Prince Lvov, the landed proprietor. 
 Thereinlies the second big fraud which the Socialist-Revolution-aries have worked on the peasants. 
 This makes it all the more imperative for us, the work-ers’ party, to reiterate the Bolshevik demand: all power in the countryside to the Soviets of Peasants’ Deputies and Agricultural Labourers’ Deputies! The peasant mandates demand the confiscation, that is, the alienation of landed estates without compensation , and the confiscation of stud farms, private pedigree stock-breeding and poultry farms, the transfer to state use of all highly efficient farms, and the confiscation of all livestock and implements on the landed estates. 
 Instead, the S. 
R. 
 ministerial bill treats the peasants to a preservation of rent , which is still to go into landlords’ coffers. 
 “Rent,” says Clause 33 of the S. 
R. 
 bill, “shall be paid to the committees, which shall hand over the remainder [after various payments to the Treasury, etc. 
] to the rightfulowner. 
” That is how the “Socialist-Revolutionaries”, having cheated the peasants with fine promises, now present them with a landowner-Cadet land bill! This is a swindle, pure and simple. 
Nothing at all remains of the peasant demand for con-fiscation. 
 This is not confiscation of landed estates, but con-solidation of landed property by a “republican” government which assures the landowners retention of both implements and land for the maintenance of their “employees and work-ers”, the retention of land “designated by the landowner [it’sas easy as that!] for the planting of sugar-beet and otherindustrial crops”, and of payment for the rest of the land which goes into the lease pool. 
 The land committees areturned into rent collectors for the landed gentry! The Socialist-Revolutionaries do not abolish but consoli-date landed property. 
 It is now abundantly clear that theyhave betrayed the peasants and have defected to the land-owners. 
 The sly Cadets, these loyal friends of the capitalists and landowners, must not be allowed to bring off their fraud. 
 The Cadets make believe that the S. 
R. 
 bill is terribly “revolutionary”, and there is a great outcry in all the bour-geois papers against it; they all report “ opposition ” on the part of the bourgeois ministers (and, of course, of theiravowed hangers-on like Kerensky) to this “terrible” bill. 
The whole thing is a farce, a game; it is the bartering of a trader who expects to drive a harder bargain with the spine-less Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
 Actually, Maslov’s is alandowners ’ bill drawn up for the express purpose of securing an agreement with them and saving them. 
 It is pure humbug for Dyelo Naroda to declare, as it does in these issues, that it is “an outstanding land bill inaugurat-ing [!] a great [!!] reform in socialising [!!!] lan d”. 
 There is no trace of “socialisation” in the bill (save perhaps for the“social” help given the landlord in assuring him of his rent);there is not the least trace of anything “revolutionary ordemocratic”; there is in fact nothing at all in it with theexception of the Irish-type “reforms” 94 which are a common feature of European bourgeois reformism. 
 Let me say this again: it is a bill to save the landowners, and to “pacify ” the incipient peasant uprising by making concessions on trifles and allowing the landowners to keep what is important. 
 The fact that the Socialist-Revolutionaries have submitted such a mean bill to the government really shows the’ in-credible hypocrisy of those who accuse the Bolsheviks of‘frustrating” the Constituent Assembly with their plans fortransferring power to the Soviets. 
 “Only 40 days till theConstituent Assembly”—Cadets, capitalists, landowners, Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, all have joined in this hypocritical cry. 
 Meanwhile, they slip the govern-ment a sweeping land bill, swindling the peasants, saddling them with landlords, consolidating landed property. 
 When it comes to supporting the landowners against the mounting peasant uprising, a sweeping bill can be rushed through 40 and even 30 days before the Constituent Assembly is due to meet. 
 When it comes to transferring all power to the Soviets in order to hand over all the land to the peasants, at once abolish landed property and at once offer a just peace, then Cadets, capitalists, landowners, Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries all join in the howl against the Bolsheviks. 
 The peasants must know how they have been cheated and betrayed to the landowners by the Socialist-RevolutionaryParty. 
 The peasants must know that it is only the workers ’ party, the Bolsheviks , who are prepared to stand to the last for the interests of the poor peasants and all working people against the capitalists and the landowners.

 Lenin LETTE R TO CENTRA L COMMITTE E MEMBER S95 Comrades, I am writing these lines on the evening of the 24th. 
 The situation is critical in the extreme. 
 In fact it is now abso-lutely clear that to delay the uprising would be fatal. 
 With all my might I urge comrades to realise that ev-erything now hangs by a thread; that we are confronted by problems which are not to be solved by conferences or con-gresses (even congresses of Soviets), but exclusively bypeoples, by the masses, by the struggle of the armed people. 
 The bourgeois onslaught of the Kornilovites and the removal of Verkhovsky 96 show that we must not wait. 
 We must at all costs, this very evening, this very night, arrest the government, having first disarmed the officer cadets (defeating them, if they resist), and so on. 
 We must not wait! We may lose everything!The value of the immediate seizure of power will be the defence of the people (not of the congress, but of the people, the army and the peasants in the first place) from the Kornilovite government, which has driven out Verkhov-sky and has hatched a second Kornilov plot. 
 Who must take power?That is not important at present. 
 Let the Revolutionary Military Committee 97 do it, or “some other institution” which will declare that it will relinquish power only to the true representatives of the interests of the people, the interests of the army (the immediate proposal of peace),the interests of the peasants (the land to be taken imme-diately and private property abolished), the interests of the starving. 
 All districts, all regiments, all forces must be mobilised at once and must immediately send their delegations to theRevolutionary Military Committee and to the CentralCommittee of the Bolsheviks with the insistent demand thatunder no circumstances should power be left in the hands ofKerensky and Co. 
 until the 25th—not under any circum-stances; the matter must be decided without fail this very evening, or this very night. 
 History will not forgive revolutionaries for procrastinat-ing when they could be victorious today (and they certainlywill be victorious today), while they risk losing much tomor-row, in fact, they risk losing everything. 
 If we seize power today, we seize it not in opposition to the Soviets but on their behalf. 
 The seizure of power is the business of the uprising; its political purpose will become clear after the seizure. 
 It would be a disaster, or a sheer formality, to await the wavering vote of October 25. 
 The people have the right and are in duty bound to decide such questions not by a vote, but by force; in critical moments of revolution, the peoplehave the right and are in duty bound to give directions totheir representatives, even their best representatives, andnot to wait for them. 
 This is proved by the history of all revolutions; and it would be an infinite crime on the part of the revolutionaries were they to let the chance slip, knowing that the salvation of the revolution , the offer of peace, the salvation of Petro-grad, salvation from famine, the transfer of the land to thepeasants depend upon them. 
 The government is tottering. 
 It must be given the death-blow at all costs. 
 To delay action is fatal.

 What is the significance of this workers’ and peasants’ revolution? Its significance is, first of all, that we shall have a Soviet government, our own organ of power, in which the bourgeoisie will have no share whatsoever. 
 The oppressedmasses will themselves create a power. 
 The old state appa-ratus will be shattered to its foundations and a new admin-istrative apparatus set up in the form of the Soviet orga-nisations. 
 From now on, a new phase in the history of Russia begins, and this, the third Russian revolution, should in the endlead to the victory of socialism. 
 One of our urgent tasks is to put an immediate end to the war. 
 It is clear to everybody that in order to end thiswar, which is closely bound up with the present capitalist system, capital itself must be fought. 
 We shall be helped in this by the world working-class movement, which is already beginning to develop in Italy, Britain and Germany. 
 The proposal we make to international democracy for a just and immediate peace will everywhere awaken an ardent response among the international proletarian masses. 
 All the secret treaties 100 must be immediately published in order to strengthen the confidence of the proletariat. 
 Within Russia a huge section of the peasantry have said that they have played long enough with the capitalists, and will now march with the workers. 
 A single decree putting an end to landed proprietorship will win us the confidenceof the peasants. 
 The peasants will understand that the salva-tion of the peasantry lies only in an alliance with the workers. 
We shall institute genuine workers’ control over production. 
 We have now learned to make a concerted effort. 
 The revo-lution that has just been accomplished is evidence of this. 
 We possess the strength of mass organisation, which willovercome everything and lead the proletariat to the worldrevolution. 
 We must now set about building a proletarian socialist state in Russia. 
 Long live the world socialist revolution! ( Stormy applause . 
) 2 RESOLUTION The Petrograd Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies hails the victorious revolution of the proletariat and thegarrison of Petrograd. 
 The Soviet particularly emphasisesthe solidarity, organisation, discipline and complete una-nimity displayed by the masses in this unusually bloodless and unusually successful uprising. 
 It is the unshakable conviction of the Soviet that the workers’ and peasants’ government which will be created bythe revolution, as a Soviet government, and which willensure the urban proletariat the support of the whole massof the poor peasantry, will firmly advance towards social-ism, the only means of saving the country from the untold miseries and horrors of war. 
 The new workers’ and peasants’ government will immedi-ately propose a just and democratic peace to all belligerentnations. 
 It will immediately abolish landed proprietorship and hand over the land to the peasants. 
 It will institute workers’ control over the production and distribution of goods andestablish national control over the banks, at the same timetransforming them into a single state enterprise. 
 The Petrograd Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies calls on all workers and all peasants to support the workers’ and peasants’ revolution devotedly and with all their energy. 
 The Soviet expresses the conviction that the urban workers,in alliance with the poor peasants, will display strict, comradely discipline and establish the strictest revolution-ary order, which is essential for the victory of socialism.

 The man-date of the compromising Central Executive Committee hasterminated. 
 102 Backed by the will of the vast majority of the workers, soldiers and peasants, backed by the victoriousuprising of the workers and the garrison which has taken place in Petrograd, the Congress takes power into its own hands. 
 The Provisional Government has been overthrown. 
 The majority of the members of the Provisional Governmenthave already been arrested. 
 The Soviet government will propose an immediate demo-cratic peace to all the nations and an immediate armistice on all fronts.

 The Congress decrees: all power in the localities shall pass to the Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’ Deputies, which must guarantee genuine revolutionaryorder. 
 The Congress calls upon the soldiers in the trenches to be vigilant and firm. 
 The Congress of Soviets is convinced that the revolutionary army will be able to defend the revo-lution against all attacks of imperialism until such time asthe new government succeeds in concluding a democraticpeace, which it will propose directly to all peoples. 
 The newgovernment will do everything to fully supply the revolution-ary army by means of a determined policy of requisitions and taxation of the propertied classes, and also will improve the condition of soldiers’ families. 
 The Kornilov men—Kerensky, Kaledin and others—are attempting to bring troops against Petrograd. 
 Severaldetachments, whom Kerensky had moved by deceiving them,have come over to the side of the insurgent people.

 9,t o the newspaper text October 26 (November 8), 1917 2 REPORT ON PEACE, OCTOBER 26 (NOVEMBER 8) The question of peace is a burning question, the painful question of the day. 
 Much has been said and written on the subject, and all of you, no doubt, have discussed it quite a lot. 
 Permit me, therefore, to proceed to read a declarationwhich the government you elect should publish. 
 DECREE ON PEACE The workers’ and peasants’ government, created by the Revolution of October 24-25 and basing itself on the Sovietsof Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’ Deputies, calls uponall the belligerent peoples and their governments to startimmediate negotiations for a just, democratic peace. 
 By a just or democratic peace, for which the overwhelming majority of the working class and other working people of all the belligerent countries, 103 exhausted, tormented and racked by the war, are craving—a peace that has been most defini-tely and insistently demanded by the Russian workers andpeasants ever since the overthrow of the tsarist monarchy—by such a peace the government means an immediate peace without annexations (i. 
e. 
, without the seizure of foreign lands, without the forcible incorporation of foreignnations) and without indemnities. 
 The Government of Russia proposes that this kind of peace be immediately concluded by all the belligerent nations,and expresses its readiness to take all the resolute measures now, without the least delay, pending the final ratification of all the terms of such a peace by authoritative assemblies ofthe people’s representatives of all countries and all nations, In accordance with the sense of justice of democrats in general, and of the working classes in particular, the govern-ment conceives the annexation or seizure of foreign lands to mean every incorporation of a small or weak nation into alarge or powerful state without the precisely, clearly andvoluntarily expressed consent and wish of that nation,irrespective of the time when such forcible incorporationtook place, irrespective also of the degree of development or backwardness of the nation forcibly annexed to the given state, or forcibly retained within its borders, and irrespec-tive, finally, of whether this nation is in Europe or in distant,overseas countries. 
 If any nation whatsoever is forcibly retained within the borders of a given state, if, in spite of its expressed desire—no matter whether expressed in the press, at public meetings, in the decisions of parties, or in protests anduprisings against national oppression—it is not accorded theright to decide the forms of its state existence by a free vote,taken after the complete evacuation of the troops of theincorporating or, generally, of the stronger nation and without the least pressure being brought to bear, such incorporation is annexation, i. 
e. 
, seizure and violence. 
 The government considers it the greatest of crimes against humanity to continue this war over the issue of how todivide among the strong and rich nations the weak national-ities they have conquered, and solemnly announces its determination immediately to sign terms of peace to stop this war on the terms indicated, which are equally just forall nationalities without exception. 
 At the same time the government declares that it does not regard the above-mentioned peace terms as an ultimatum;in other words, it is prepared to consider any other peace terms, and insists only that they be advanced by any of the belligerent countries as speedily as possible, and that inthe peace proposals there should be absolute clarity and thecomplete absence of all ambiguity and secrecy. 
 The government abolishes secret diplomacy, and, for its part, announces its firm intention to conduct all negotia-tions quite openly in full view of the whole people. 
 It will proceed immediately with the full publication of the secrettreaties endorsed or concluded by the government of land- /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR owners and capitalists from February to October 25, 1917. 
 The government proclaims the unconditional and immediate annulment of everything contained in these secret treaties insofar as it is aimed, as is mostly the case, at securing advan-tages and privileges for the Russian landowners and capialists and at the retention, or extension, of the annexationsmade by the Great Russians. 
 Proposing to the governments and peoples of all countries immediately to begin open negotiations for peace, the go-vernment, for its part, expresses its readiness to conductthese negotiations in writing, by telegraph, and by negotia-tions between representatives of the various countries, orat a conference of such representatives. 
 In order to facilitatesuch negotiations, the government is appointing its pleni-potentiary representative to neutral countries. 
 The government proposes an immediate armistice to the governments and peoples of all the belligerent countries,and, for its part, considers it desirable that this armisticeshould be concluded for a period of not less than three months,i. 
e. 
, a period long enough to permit the completion of negotia-tions for peace with the participation of the representatives of all peoples or nations, without exception, involved in orcompelled to take part in the war, and the summoning ofauthoritative assemblies of the representatives of the peoplesof all countries for the final ratification of the peace terms. 
 While addressing this proposal for peace to the govern-ments and peoples of all the belligerent countries, the Provisional Workers’ and Peasants’ Government of Russiaappeals in particular also to the class-conscious workersof the three most advanced nations of mankind and thelargest states participating in the present war, namely,Great Britain, France and Germany. 
 The workers of these countries have made the greatest contributions to the cause of progress and socialism; they have furnished the greatexamples of the Chartist movement in England, a number ofrevolutions of historic importance effected by the Frenchproletariat, and, finally, the heroic struggle against theAnti-Socialist Law in Germany 104 and the prolonged, persis-tent and disciplined work of creating mass proletarian orga-nisations in Germany, a work which serves as a model to theworkers of the whole world. 
 All these examples of proletar-ian heroism and historical creative work are a pledge that the workers of the countries mentioned will understand the duty that now faces them of saving mankind from the hor-rors of war and its consequences, that these workers, by com-prehensive, determined, and supremely vigorous action, willhelp us to conclude peace successfully, and at the same timeemancipate the labouring and exploited masses of our popu-lation from all forms of slavery and all forms of exploitation. 
 The workers’ and peasants’ government, created by the Revolution of October 24-25 and basing itself on the supportof the Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’ Deputies,must start immediate negotiations for peace. 
 Our appeal must be addressed both to the governments and to the peoples. 
 We cannot ignore the governments, for that would delaythe possibility of concluding peace, and the people’s govern-ment dare not do that, but we have no right not to appeal tothe peoples at the same time. 
 Everywhere there are dif-ferences between the governments and the peoples, and we must therefore help the peoples to intervene in questions of war and peace. 
 We will, of course, insist upon the whole ofour programme for a peace without annexations and indem-nities. 
 We shall not retreat from it; but we must not giveour enemies an opportunity to say that their conditions aredifferent from ours and that therefore it is useless to start negotiations with us. 
 No, we must deprive them of that advantageous position and not present our terms in the formof an ultimatum. 
 Therefore the point is included that we arewilling to consider any peace terms and all proposals. 
 Weshall consider them, but that does not necessarily meanthat we shall accept them. 
 We shall submit them for consid-eration to the Constituent Assembly which will have the power to decide what concessions can and what cannot bemade. 
 We are combating the deception practised by govern-ments which pay lip-service to peace and justice, but infact wage annexationist and predatory wars. 
 No governmentwill say all it thinks. 
 We, however, are opposed to secret diplomacy and will act openly in full view of the whole people. 
 We do not close our eyes to difficulties and neverhave done. 
 War cannot be ended by refusal, it cannot be ended by one side. 
 We are proposing an armistice for three months, but shall not reject a shorter period, so that the exhausted army may breathe freely, even if only for a little while; moreover, in all the civilised countries national assem-blies must be summoned for the discussion of the terms. 
 In proposing an immediate armistice, we appeal to the class-conscious workers of the countries that have done somuch for the development of the proletarian movement. 
 We appeal to the workers of Britain, where there was the Char-tist movement, to the workers of France, who have in repeat-ed uprisings displayed the strength of their class conscious-ness, and to the workers of Germany, who waged the fightagainst the Anti-Socialist Law and have created powerfulorganisations. 
 In the Manifesto of March 14, 105 we called for the over-throw of the bankers, but, far from overthrowing our ownbankers, we entered into an alliance with them. 
 Now wehave overthrown the government of the bankers. 
 The governments and the bourgeoisie will make every effort to unite their forces and drown the workers’ and peasants’ revolution in blood. 
 But the three years of war have been a good lesson to the masses—the Soviet movementin other countries and the mutiny in the German navy, whichwas crushed by the officer cadets of Wilhelm the hangman. 
 106 Finally, we must remember that we are not living in thedepths of Africa, but in Europe, where news can spread quickly. 
 The workers’ movement will triumph and will pave the way to peace and socialism.

 171,t o the Pravd a text, November 10 (October 28), 1917 decree according to the Izvestia text 3 CONCLUDING SPEECH FOLLOWING THE DISCUSSION ON THE REPORT ON PEACE OCTOBER 26 (NOVEMBER 8) I shall not touch on the general character of the decla-ration. 
 The government which your Congress sets up mayamend unessential points. 
 I shall vigorously oppose lending our demand for peace the form of an ultimatum. 
 An ultimatum may prove fatalto our whole cause. 
 We cannot demand that, since someinsignificant departure from our demands on the part of theimperialist governments would give them the opportunity ofsaying that it was impossible to enter into negotiations for peace because of our irreconcilability. 
 We shall send out our appeal everywhere, it will be made known to everybody. 
 It will be impossible to conceal theterms proposed by our workers’ and peasants’ government. 
 It will be impossible to hush up our workers’ and peasants’ revolution, which has overthrown the government of bankers and landowners. 
 The governments may not reply to an ultimatum; they will have to reply to the text as we formulate it. 
 Let every-one know what their governments have in mind. 
 We donot want any secrets. 
 We want a government to be alwaysunder the supervision of the public opinion of its country. 
 What will the peasant of some remote province say if, owing to our insistence on ultimatums, he will not know whatanother government wants? He will say: Comrades, why didyou rule out the possibility of any peace terms being pro-posed? I would have discussed them, I would have examinedthem, and would then have instructed my representatives in the Constituent Assembly how to act. 
 I am prepared to fight by revolutionary methods for just terms if the govern-ments do not agree, but there might be such terms for some countries that I would be prepared to recommend their governments to go on fighting by themselves. 
 The full realisation of our ideas depends solely on the overthrow of the entire capitalist system. 
 This is what the peasantmight say to us, and he would accuse us of being excessivelyuncompromising over trifles, when for us the main thing isto expose all the vileness, all the baseness of the bourgeoisieand of its crowned and uncrowned hangmen at the head of the government. 
 We should not and must not give the governments an opportunity of taking refuge behind our uncompromisingattitude and of concealing from the peoples the reason whythey are being sent to the shambles. 
 This is a tiny drop, butwe should not and must not reject this drop, which will wear away the stone of bourgeois conquest. 
 An ultimatum would make the position of our opponents easier. 
 But weshall make all the terms known to the people. 
 We shallconfront all the governments with our terms, and let themgive an answer to their people. 
 We shall submit all peaceproposals to the Constituent Assembly for decision. 
 There is still another point, comrades, to which you must pay the most careful attention. 
 The secret treatiesmust be published. 
 The clauses dealing with annexations andindemnities must be annulled. 
 There are various clauses,comrades—the predatory governments, you know, not onlymade agreements between themselves on plunder, but among them they also included economic agreements and various other clauses on good-neighbourly relations. 
 We shall not bind ourselves by treaties. 
 We shall not allow ourselves to be entangled by treaties. 
 We reject allclauses on plunder and violence, but we shall welcome allclauses containing provisions for good-neighbourly relations and all economic agreements; we cannot reject these. 
 We propose an armistice for three months; we choose a lengthyperiod because the peoples are exhausted, the peoples longfor a respite from this bloody shambles that has lastedover three years. 
 We must realise that the peoples shouldbe given an opportunity to discuss the peace terms and to express their will with parliament participating, and this takes time. 
 We demand a lengthy armistice, so that thesoldiers in the trenches may enjoy a respite from this night-mare of constant slaughter; but we shall not reject proposals for a shorter armistice; we shall examine them, and it is incumbent upon us to accept them, even if we are offered an armistice of a month or a month and a half. 
 Nor must ourproposal for an armistice have the form of an ultimatum, forwe shall not give our enemies an opportunity of concealingthe whole truth from the peoples, using our irreconcilabilityas a pretext. 
 It must not be in the form of an ultimatum, for a government is criminal that does not desire an armistice. 
 If we do not put our proposal for an armistice in the formof an ultimatum, we shall thereby show the peoples that thegovernments are criminal, and the peoples will not stand onceremony with such criminals. 
 The objection is raised thatby not resorting to an ultimatum we are displaying weakness, but it is time to cast aside all bourgeois cant when speaking of the strength of the people. 
 According to the bourgeoisconception, there is strength when the people go blindlyto the slaughter in obedience to the imperialist governments. 
The bourgeoisie admit a state to be strong only when it can,by the power of the government apparatus, hurl the people wherever the bourgeois rulers want them hurled. 
 Our idea of strength is different. 
 Our idea is that a state is strong whenthe people are politically conscious. 
 It is strong when thepeople know everything, can form an opinion of everythingand do everything consciously. 
 We need not fear to tellthe truth about fatigue, for what state today is not tired, what nation does not talk about it openly? Take Italy, where, owing to this tiredness, there was a prolonged revolutionarymovement demanding the termination of the slaughter. 
Are there not mass demonstrations of workers in Germanythat put forward a demand for the termination of the war?Was it not fatigue that provoked the mutiny in the German navy that was so ruthlessly suppressed by that hangman, Wilhelm, and his hirelings? If such things are possible inso disciplined a country as Germany, where they are begin-ning to talk about fatigue and about putting an end to thewar, we need not fear to say the same openly, because it isthe truth, equally true both of our country and of all the belligerent and even non-belligerent countries. 
 Pravda No. 
 171, Published according to November 10 (October 28), 1917 the Pravd a text 4 REPORT ON LAND OCTOBER 26 (NOVEMBER 8) We maintain that the revolution has proved and demon-strated how important it is that the land question should be put clearly. 
 The outbreak of the armed uprising, thesecond, October, Revolution, clearly proves that the landmust be turned over to the peasants. 
 The government thathas been overthrown and the compromising parties of theMensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries committed a crime when they kept postponing the settlement of the land ques-tion on various pretexts and thereby brought the countryto economic chaos and a peasant revolt. 
 Their talk aboutriots and anarchy in the countryside sounds false, cowardly,and deceitful. 
 Where and when have riots and anarchybeen provoked by wise measures? If the government had acted wisely, and if their measures had met the needs of the poor peasants, would there have been unrest amongthe peasant masses? But all the measures of the government,approved by the Avksentyev and Dan Soviets, went counterto the interests of the peasants and compelled them torevolt. 
 Having provoked the revolt, the government raised a hue and cry about riots and anarchy, for which they themselveswere responsible. 
 They were going to crush it by blood andiron, but were themselves swept away by the armed uprisingof the revolutionary soldiers, sailors and workers. 
 Thefirst duty of the government of the workers’ and peasants’ revolution must be to settle the land question, which can pacify and satisfy the vast masses of poor peasants. 
 I shallread to you the clauses of a decree your Soviet Government must issue. 
 In one of the clauses of this decree is embodied the Mandate to the Land Committees, compiled on the basis of 242 mandates from local Soviets of Peasants’ Depu-ties. 
 DECREE ON LAND (1) Landed proprietorship is abolished forthwith without any compensation. 
 (2) The landed estates, as also all crown, monastery, and church lands, with all their livestock, implements, build-ings and everything pertaining thereto, shall be placed atthe disposal of the volost land committees and the uyezdSoviets of Peasants’ Deputies pending the convocationof the Constituent Assembly. 
 (3) All damage to confiscated property, which henceforth belongs to the whole people, is proclaimed a grave crime tobe punished by the revolutionary courts. 
 The uyezd Sovietsof Peasants’ Deputies shall take all necessary measures toassure the observance of the strictest order during the con-fiscation of the landed estates, to determine the size of estates, and the particular estates subject to confiscation, to draw up exact inventories of all property confiscated andto protect in the strictest revolutionary way all agriculturalenterprises transferred to the people, with all buildings,implements, livestock, stocks of produce, etc. 
 (4) The following peasant Mandate, compiled by the news-paper Izvestia Vserossiiskogo Soveta Krestyanskikh Deputatov107 from 242 local peasant mandates and published in No. 
 88 of that paper (Petrograd, No. 
 88, August 19, 1917), shallserve everywhere to guide the implementation of the greatland reforms until a final decision on the latter is taken bythe Constituent Assembly. 
 P e a s a n t M a n d a t e o n t h e L a n d “The land question in its full scope can be settled only by the popular Constituent Assembly. 
 “The most equitable settlement of the land question is to be as follows: “(1) Private ownership of land shall be abolished for ever ; land shall not be sold purchased, leased, mortgaged, or otherwise alienated. 
 “All land, whether state , crown , monastery , church , factory , entai-sation and become the property of the whole people, and pass into the use of all those who cultivate it. 
 “Persons who suffer by this property revolution shall be deemed to be entitled to public support only for the period necessary foradaptation to the new conditions of life. 
 “(2) All m ineral wealth—ore, oil, coal, salt, etc. 
, and also all forests and waters of state importance, shall pass into the exclusiveuse of the state. 
 All the small streams, lakes, woods, etc. 
, shall pass into the use of the communes, to be administered by the local self-government bodies. 
 “(3) Lands on which high-level scientific farming is practised—or-chards, plantations, seed plots, nurseries, hothouses, etc. 
— shall not be divided up , but shall be converted into model farms , to be turned over for exclusive use to the state or to the communes , depending on he size and importance of such lands. 
 “Household land in towns and villages, with orchards and vege-table gardens, shall be reserved for the use of their present owners, the size of the holdings, and the size of tax levied for the use thereof, to be determined by law. 
 “(4) Stud farms, government and private pedigree stock and poul-try farms, etc. 
, shall be confiscated and become the property of the whole people, and pass into the exclusive use of the state or a com-mune depending on the size and importance of such farms. 
 “The question of compensation shall be examined by the Consti-tuent Assembly. 
 “(5) All livestock and farm implements of the confiscated estates shall pass into the exclusive use of the state or a commune, depen-ding on their size and importance, and no compensation shall be paidfor this. 
 “The farm implements of peasants with little land shall not be subject to confiscation. 
 “(6) The right to use the land shall be accorded to all citizens of the Russian state (without distinction of sex) desiring to cultivate it by their own labour, with the help of their families, or in partnership,but only as long as they are able to cultivate it. 
 The employment of hired labour is not permitted. 
 “In the event of the temporary physical disability of any member of a village commune for a period of up to two years, the village com-mune shall be obliged to assist him for this period by collectively cultivating his land until he is again able to work. 
 “Peasants who, owing to old age or ill-health, are permanently disabled and unable to cultivate the land personally, shall lose their right to the use of it but, in return, shall receive a pension from the state. 
 “(7) Land tenure shall be on an equality basis, i. 
e. 
 the land shall be distributed among the working people in conformity with a labourstandard or a subsistence standard, 108 depending on local condi-tions. 
 “There shall be absolutely no restriction on the forms of land tenu-re—household, farm, communal, or co-operative, as shall be decided “(8) All land, when alienated, shall become part of the national land fund. 
 Its distribution among the peasants shall be in charge ofthe local and central self-government bodies, from democraticallyorganised village and city communes, in which there are no distinc-tions of social rank, to central regional government bodies. 
 “The land fund shall be subject to periodical redistribution depend-ing on the growth of population and the increase in the productivityand the scientific level of farming. 
 “When the boundaries of allotments are altered, the original nucleus of the allotment shall be left intact. 
 “The land of the members who leave the commune shall revert to the land fund, preferential right to such land shall be given tothe near relatives of the members who have left, or to persons desig-nated by the latter. 
 “The cost of fertilisers and improvements put into the land, to the extent that they have not been fully used up at the time the allot-ment is returned to the land fund shall be compensated. 
 “Should the available land fund in a particular district prove inadequate for the needs of the local population, the surplus popula-tion shall he settled elsewhere. 
 “The state shall take upon itself the organisation of resettlement and shall bear the cost thereof, as well as the cost of supplying imple-ments, etc. 
 “Resettlement shall be effected in the following order: landless peasants desiring to resettle, then members of the commune who areof vicious habits, deserters, and so on, and, finally, by lot or by agree-ment. 
” The entire contents of this Mandate, as expressing the absolute will of the vast majority of the class-consciouspeasants of all Russia, is proclaimed a provisional law, which, pending the convocation of the Constituent Assembly, shall be carried into effect as far as possible immediately,and as to certain of its provisions with due gradualness,as shall be determined by the uyezd Soviets of Peasants’Deputies. 
 (5) The land of ordinary peasants and ordinary Cossacks shall not be confiscated. 
 Voices are being raised here that the decree itself and the Mandate were drawn up by the Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
What of it? Does it matter who drew them up? As a demo-cratic government, we cannot ignore the decision of the masses of the people, even though we may disagree with it. 
In the fire of experience, applying the decree in practice, and carrying it out locally, the peasants will themselves realise where the truth lies. 
 And even if the peasants continue to follow the Socialist-Revolutionaries, even if they give this party a majority in the Constituent Assembly, we shallstill say—what of it? Experience is the best teacher and itwill show who is right. 
 Let the peasants solve this problemfrom one end and we shall solve it from the other. 
 Experiencewill oblige us to draw together in the general stream of revolutionary creative work, in the elaboration of new state forms. 
 We must be guided by experience; we must allowcomplete freedom to the creative faculties of the masses. 
The old government, which was overthrown by armeduprising, wanted to settle the land problem with the help ofthe old, unchanged tsarist bureaucracy. 
 But instead of solving the problem, the bureaucracy only fought the peasants. 
 The peasants have learned something during the eight monthsof our revolution; they want to settle all land problems them-selves. 
 We are therefore opposed to all amendments to thisdraft law. 
 We want no details in it, for we are writing adecree, not a programme of action. 
 Russia is vast, and local conditions vary. 
 We trust that the peasants themselves will be able to solve the problem correctly, properly, betterthan we could do it. 
 Whether they do it in our spirit or inthe spirit of the Socialist-Revolutionary programme is notthe point. 
 The point is that the peasants should be firmlyassured that there are no more landowners in the countryside, that they themselves must decide all questions, and that they themselves must arrange their own lives.

 XXII DIRECT-LINE CONVERSATION WITH HELSINGFORS OCTOBER 27 (NOVEMBER 9), 1917 1 CONVERSATION WITH A. 
 L. 
 SHEINMAN, CHAIRMAN OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE HELSINGFORS SOVIET OF DEPUTIES OF THE ARMY, NAVY AND WORKERS OF FINLAND Are you authorised to speak on behalf of the Regional Army and Navy Committee? Of course, I am. 
 Can you move the greatest possible number of destroyers and other warships to Petrograd at once? Let me call the Tsentrobalt * Chairman, because this is a purely naval matter. 
 What’s new in Petrograd? There is a report that Kerensky’s troops have moved up and have taken Gatchina, and since a part of the Petrogradtroops are tired, it is imperative that we have the strongest reinforcements as soon as possible. 
 Anything else? Instead of the “anything else” I expected you to say you were ready to set out and fight. 
 That goes without saying: we have announced our decision and will, consequently, act up to it. 
 *The Central Committee of the Baltic Fleet. 
— Ed. 
 Have you any stocks of rifles and machine-guns, and in what quantities? Here is Mikhailov, Chairman of the Regional Committee’s Mili-tary Department. 
 He will tell you about the army in Finland. 
 2 CONVERSATION WITH MIKHAILOV, CHAIRMAN OF THE MILITARY DEPARTMENT OF THE REGIONAL COMMITTEE OF THE ARMY, NAVY AND WORKERS OF FINLAND How many men do you need? As many as possible, but only loyal men who are ready to fight. 
 How many such men have you? All of 5,000. 
 Those who will fight can be sent urgently. 
 If sent with all possible dispatch, how many hours will it take them to reach Petrograd for sure? Twenty-four hours, from now, at the outside. 
 By the overland route? By rail. 
 Can you supply them with rations? Yes. 
 There are plenty of rations. 
 There are also about 35 machine-guns; we could also send a few field guns with their detachments without worsening the situation here. 
 On behalf of the Government of the Republic I insistently request you to start such dispatch at once, and also to tell mewhether you are aware of the formation of the new govern-ment, and how the news has been met by your Soviets? We heard about the government only from the papers. 
 People over here are enthusiastic about power passing into the hands of the Soviets. 
 So, you say, the troops will set out at once, and will be supplied with rations? That’s right. 
 We’ll set about their dispatch right away and will supply them with rations. 
 Here’s the Tsentrobalt Deputy Chairman because Dybenko himself went to Petrograd at 10. 
00 p. 
m. 
 today. 
 3 CONVERSATION WITH N. 
 F. 
 IZMAILOV , DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF TSENTROBALT How many destroyers and other warships can you send? We can send the battleship Republic and two destroyers. 
 Will they also be supplied with rations from your end? Our fleet has enough rations, and they will be supplied. 
 I want to say I am sure the Republic and all the destroyers we send will do their duty in defending the revolution. 
 Have no doubt about thedispatch of the armed forces. 
 This will be fulfilled without fail. 
 In how many hours? Eighteen, at the most. 
 Is there any need to send them out now? Yes. 
 The government is absolutely convinced that there is need for their immediate dispatch so that the battleshipcould enter the Ship Canal as close to the shore as possible. 
 The battleship is a large vessel with 12-inch guns, and cannot anchor offshore: if it did it could be easily boarded and captured. 
This can be done by the destroyers, with their small-calibre guns andmachine-guns-as for the battleship, it should be in the roads or closeby, or near the cruiser Aurora , because its guns have a range of 25 versts *; in short let the sailors and their command handle this. 
 The destroyers must enter the Neva near the Rybatskoye village, in order to protect the Nikolayevskaya railway lineand all the approaches to it. 
 Right, all this will be done. 
 What else is there? Is there a wireless telegraph on the Republic and can it communicate with Petrograd while on its way? Not only on the Republic , but also on the destroyers, they can all communicate with the Eiffel Tower. 
 Let me assure you that every-thing will be done well. 
 May we expect that the ships will set out immediately? Yes, that is so. 
 We shall issue urgent orders right away so that these ships will get to Petrograd in time. 
 Have you stocks of rifles and ammunition? Let’s have everything you can spare. 
 *25 versts =16. 
5 miles. 
— Tr. 
 There are some on the ships, but we shall let you have everything there is. 
 Good-bye. 
 Good luck. 
 Good-bye. 
 Was that you speaking? Will you tell me your name? Lenin. 
 Good-bye. 
 We’re setting everything in motion.

 10 CONFERENC E OF REGIMENTA L DELEGATES OF THE PETROGRA D GARRISON OCTOBE R 29 (NOVEMBER 1 1), 1917110 NEWSPAPER REPORT 1 REPORT ON THE CURRENT SITUATION The political situation does not warrant long speeches. 
 The political question is now merging with the military question. 
 It is all too clear that Kerensky has recruited theKornilovites, and they are his only support. 
 In Moscow theyhave seized the Kremlin, but they have no control over thesuburbs, where the workers and the poor in general live. 
 Thereis no one to back Kerensky at the front. 
 Even those who are of two minds, like the members of the Railwaymen’s Union, are speaking in favour of the Decrees on Peace and on Land. 
 The vast majority of workers, soldiers and peasants want a policy of peace. 
 This is not a Bolshevik policy. 
 In no sense is it a “party” policy. 
 It is the policy of the workers, soldiers and peasants, that is, the majority of the people. 
 Nor are we implementing a Bolshevik programme on the land question, because there,too, our programme has been taken bodily from peasantmandates. 
 It is not our fault that the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Mensheviks have gone. 
 They were invited to share political power, but they want to sit on the fence until the fight against Kerensky is over. 
 We asked everyone to take part in the government. 
 The Left Socialist-Revolutionaries 111 said they wanted to sup-port the Soviet Government’s policy. 
 They did not even darevoice disagreement with the new government’s programme. 
 People in the provinces give credence to papers like Dyelo Naroda . 
 Here everyone knows that the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Mensheviks went because they were left in a minority. 
 The men of the Petrograd garrison are aware of this. 
 They know that we wanted a coalition Soviet government. 
 We did not exclude anyone from the Soviet. 
 If they do not want to work with us, so much the worse forthem. 
 The mass of soldiers and peasants will not followthe Mensheviks or the Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
 I am surethat nine-tenths of any workers’ or soldiers’ meeting willbe on our side. 
 Kerensky’s bid is just as pathetic a gamble as Kornilov’s. 
 But the situation is a difficult one. 
 Vigorous efforts mustbe made to get some order into the food situation, and putan end to the misery at the fronts. 
 We cannot wait, nor canwe tolerate Kerensky’s mutiny a single day. 
 If the Korni-lovites launch another offensive, they will get what the mutinous officer cadets got today. 
 The cadets have only themselves to blame. 
 We took power almost without blood-shed. 
 If there were any losses they were on our side. 
 Theentire people wanted the policy the new government is con-ducting. 
 It did not borrow this policy from the Bolsheviks,but from the soldiers at the front, the peasants in the villages, and the workers in the towns. 
 The Decree on Workers’ Control is to be issued presently. 
 Let me say this again: the political situation is now reducedto a military one. 
 We cannot allow Kerensky to win: ifhe did there would be no peace, no land, and no freedom. 
I am sure that the soldiers and workers of Petrograd, who have just brought off a victorious revolution, will be able to crush the Kornilovites. 
 We have had our defects. 
 Thereis no use denying it. 
 We have had to pay for them. 
 But theycan be eliminated. 
 Without losing a single hour, a singleminute, we must get organised, and set up a headquarters,and we must do it today. 
 Once organised, we are sure to win out within a few days, and possibly even earlier. 
 The government set up by the will of the workers’, sol-diers’ and peasants’ deputies will not tolerate any nonsensefrom the Kornilovites. 
 The political and the military task is to set up a head-quarters, to concentrate the material forces, and to provide the soldiers with all they need. 
 If we are to go on from strength to strength, this must be done without wasting asingle hour, nay, minute. 
 2 SPEECH ON ARMING THE TROOPS The period of great chaos is at an end. 
 A chief of staff has been appointed and this will be announced. 
 The period ofvacillation is over. 
 We felt keenly the lack of military orderand communications. 
 It has now been established that thereis a great deal of enthusiasm and unity among the troops. 
 It is now up to you to take things in hand, personally verify every act, the execution of your orders and assignments,see whether the workers’ organisations have been contacted,etc. 
 The workers will help you in this matter. 
 Let me giveyou some advice: you must check every report through thecontrol commission or through the regimental delegates, without relying on others to see that orders are carried out, or to check reports on stocks. 
 The best guarantee of successis to do all this yourself, to check everything, take accountof all stocks and verify every step personally. 
 3 SPEECH ON RESTORING LAW AND ORDER IN THE CITY I fully agree with what has been said: the workers must take a hand in guarding the city. 
 As they do this together,the soldiers will teach the workers how to handle arms. 
The wholesale arming of the people and the abolition of theregular army is a task which we must not lose sight of for a single minute. 
 If we recruit the working population the task will be much easier. 
 The comrades’ proposal that wemeet every day is a practical one. 
 It is true that the Russianrevolution produces a great deal of what is novel, that hasnot occurred in any other revolution. 
 For one thing, therehave never been such organs as the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies. 
 You must merge with the workers, they will give you everything the bourgeoisie has failed to giveyou. 
 Every unit, together with the workers’ organisation,must see to it that there is a stock of everything necessaryfor this war of yours, without waiting for pointers fromabove. 
 We must tackle this task on our own tonight. 
 The units must not wait for instructions from headquarters, they must make their own proposals. 
 You have somethingthe bourgeoisie have never bad: their only way is to buy;you can contact the workers who produce everything.

 174, November 13 Published according (October 31), 1917 to the Pravda text WIRELESS MESSAGE OF THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE ’S COMMISSARS OCTOBER 30 (NOVEMBER 12), 1917 Calling Everyone The All-Russia Congress of Soviets has set up a new Soviet Government. 
 Kerensky’s government has been overthrownand arrested. 
 Kerensky has fled. 
 All institutions are in the hands of the Soviet Government. 
 A revolt of officer cadets who had been released on parole on October 25 broke out onOctober 29. 
 The revolt was suppressed that same day. 
Kerensky and Savinkov, together with the officer cadets anda part of the Cossacks, have made their way by deceit toTsarskoye Syelo. 
 The Soviet Government has mustered forces for the suppression of the new Kornilov advance on Petrograd. 
 The fleet, headed by the armoured battleshipRepublic , has been summoned to the capital. 
 Kerensky’s officer cadets and Cossacks are wavering. 
 Prisoners arrivingfrom Kerensky’s camp assure us that the Cossacks have beendeceived and that if they come to realise the true state of affairs they will refuse to shoot. 
 The Soviet Government is making every effort to avert bloodshed. 
 If bloodshed cannotbe avoided and if Kerensky’s units do begin to shoot, theSoviet Government will not hesitate to suppress the newKerensky-Kornilov campaign ruthlessly. 
 We announce for your information that the Congress of Soviets which has already dispersed, adopted two important decrees: (1) on the immediate transfer of all the landed estatesto the peasant committees, and (2) on the proposal of ademocratic peace.

 (B.

 There is now no point in negotiatingwith the Vikzhel. 
 112 Troops must be dispatched to Moscow. 
 He proposes a resolution on the Vikzhel. 
 The Vikzhel is not represented on the Soviet, and must not be admitted toit; the Soviets are voluntary organisations, and the Vikzhelhas no support among the people. 
 2 Comrade Lenin considers that the negotiations were to serve as diplomatic cover for military operations. 
 The onlycorrect solution would be to put an end to the wavering ofthe waverers and to become firm ourselves. 
 Assistance mustbe given to the Muscovites, and our victory will be assured. 
 3 Comrade Lenin considers the question a fundamental one, and thinks it is time to put an end to wavering. 
 It is obviousthat the Vikzhel sides with the Kaledins and Kornilovs. 
There must be no vacillation. 
 We are backed by the majorityof the workers and peasants and of the army. 
 Nobody here has proved that the rank and file are against us. 
 Either with the agents of Kaledin, or with the rank and file. 
 We mustrely on the people, we must send propagandists into the coun-tryside. 
 The Vikzhel was called upon to transport troops toMoscow; it refused, we must appeal to the people, and theywill overthrow it.

 (B. 
) ON THE OPPOSITION WITHIN THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE NOVEMBER 2 (15), 1917 The Central Committee considers that the present meeting is of historic importance and that it is therefore necessary to record the two positions which have been revealed here. 
 1. 
 The Central Committee considers that the opposition formed within the Central Committee has departed com-pletely from all the fundamental positions of Bolshevism andof the proletarian class struggle in general by reiterating theutterly un-Marxist talk of the impossibility of a socialist revolution in Russia and of the necessity of yielding to the ultimatums and threats of resignation on the part of theobvious minority in the Soviet organisation, thus thwartingthe will and the decision of the Second All-Russia Congressof Soviets and sabotaging the dictatorship of the proletariatand the poor peasantry which has been inaugurated. 
 2. 
 The Central Committee lays the whole responsibility for hindering revolutionary work and for the vacillations,so criminal at the present moment, on this opposition, andinvites them to transfer their discussion and their scepticismto the press and to withdraw from the practical work theydo not believe in. 
 For this opposition reflects nothing but intimidation by the bourgeoisie and the sentiments of the exhausted (not the revolutionary) section of the population. 
 3. 
 The Central Committee affirms that the purely Bol-shevik government cannot be renounced without betrayingthe slogan of Soviet power, since the majority at the SecondAll-Russia Congress of Soviets, without excluding anybody from the Congress, entrusted power, to this government. 
 4. 
 The Central Committee affirms that, without betray-ing the slogan of the power of the Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’ Deputies, there can be no entering into petty bargaining over the affiliation to the Soviets of organisations of a non-Soviet type, i. 
e. 
, organisations which are not voluntary associations of the revolutionaryvanguard of the people who are fighting for the overthrowof the landowners and capitalists. 
 5. 
 The Central Committee affirms that to yield to the ultimatums and threats of the minority of the Soviets would be tantamount to complete renunciation not only of Soviet power but of democracy, for such yielding would be tanta-mount to the majority’s fear to make use of its majority, itwould be tantamount to submitting to anarchy and invitingthe repetition of ultimatums on the part of any mino-rity. 
 6. 
 The Central Committee affirms that, not having excluded anybody from the Second All-Russia Congress ofSoviets, it is even now fully prepared to permit the returnof those who walked out and to agree to a coalition withinthe Soviets with those who walked out, and that, conse-quently, all talk about the Bolsheviks refusing to share power with anybody is absolutely false. 
 7. 
 The Central Committee affirms that on the day the pre-sent government was formed, a few hours before its forma-tion, the Central Committee invited three representativesof the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries to attend its meetingand formally proposed that they should join the govern-ment. 
 The refusal of the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, although it was provisional and conditional, places on theseLeft Socialist-Revolutionaries the entire responsibilityfor the fact that an agreement with them was not reached. 
 8. 
 The Central Committee recalls that a resolution, proposed by the Bolshevik group, was adopted by the Second All-Russia Congress of Soviets expressing readiness to reinforce the Soviet both by soldiers from the trenches andby peasants from the localities, from the villages, and thattherefore the assertion that the Bolshevik government isopposed to a coalition with the peasants is absolutely false. 
On the contrary, the Central Committee declares that the land law of our government, which was wholly copied from the Socialist-Revolutionary Mandate, is practical proof ofthe complete and most sincere readiness of the Bolsheviks to effect a coalition with the vast majority of Russia’s population. 
 9. 
 The Central Committee affirms, finally, that despite all difficulties, the victory of socialism both in Russia andin Europe can only be ensured by the unswerving contin-uation of the present government’s policy. 
 The CentralCommittee expresses its firm belief in the victory of thissocialist revolution and calls upon all sceptics and waverers to abandon their waverings and whole-heartedly and with supreme energy support the actions of this government.

 (Bolsheviks), fully approving the policy so far pursued by the Council of People’s Commissars, considers it necessary to address the following categorical statement to the mi-nority on the Central Committee. 
 Our Party’s policy at the present moment is defined in the resolution submitted by Comrade Lenin and adoptedyesterday, November 2, by the Central Committee. 
 * This resolution declares that every attempt to induce our Party to decline power is treason to the proletariat’s cause, sincethe All-Russia Congress of Soviets, in the name of the mil-lions of workers, soldiers and peasants, has entrusted thispower to the representatives of our Party on the basis ofour programme. 
 This fundamental line of our tactics, which follows logically from our whole struggle against the concil-iators and which guided us in the uprising against Keren-sky’s government, at present constitutes the revolutionaryessence of Bolshevism and is once again endorsed by theCentral Committee. 
 This line is absolutely binding on allmembers of the Party, and first and foremost, on the Central Committee minority. 
 Yet members of the minority, both before and after yesterday’s meeting of the Central Committee, have beenpursuing a policy which obviously runs counter to our Party’sfundamental line and which is demoralising our own ranksby causing hesitation at a moment when the greatest firm-ness and steadfastness are essential. 
 *See pp. 
 277 -79 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 Thus, at yesterday’s meeting of the Central Executive Committee, the Bolshevik group, with the direct participa-tion of the Central Committee’s minority members, openly voted against a decision of the Central Committee (on thenumber and persons of the representatives of our Party inthe government). 
 This unparalleled violation of discipline,committed by Central Committee member’s behind the backof the Central Committee after many hours’ discussions on the Central Committee, discussions provoked by these same members of the opposition, makes it obvious to us that theopposition intend to force the hand of Party institutionsby sabotaging the Party’s work at a moment when the fateof the Party, the fate of the revolution, depends upon theimmediate result of this work. 
 We cannot and do not wish to bear responsibility for such a state of affairs. 
 Addressing the present statement to the minority of the Central Committee, we categorically demand a writtenreply to the question: Does the minority undertake to submitto Party discipline and to carry out the policy formulated in Comrade Lenin’s resolution which was adopted by the Central Committee? In the event of a negative or indefinite reply to this question we shall immediately place before the PetrogradCommittee, the Moscow Committee, the Bolshevik group onthe Central Executive Committee, the Petrograd City Conference and the Extraordinary Party Congress, the follow-ing alternative proposal: Either the Party must entrust the present opposition with the task of forming a new government in conjunctionwith those of its allies on whose behalf the opposition is atpresent sabotaging our work—in which case we shall consider ourselves absolutely free in relation to this new government, which can contribute nothing but wavering,impotence and chaos. 
 Or—which we do not doubt—the Party will endorse the only possible revolutionary line, as expressed in yesterday’sdecision of the Central Committee—in which case the Party must categorically demand that the members of the oppo-sition conduct their disorganising work outside our Partyorganisation. 
 There is not and cannot be any other solution. 
 It stands to reason, a split would be highly deplorable. 
 But an honest and open split would now be incomparably better than internal sabotage, the thwarting of our own decisions, disorganisation and prostration. 
 At any rate, we donot doubt for a moment that the submission of our differences(which are in the main a replica of our differences with theNovaya Zhizn and Martov groups) to the people’s judge-ment will ensure our policy the unreserved and devoted support of the revolutionary workers, soldiers and peasants, and will very soon condemn the wavering opposition toimpotent isolation.

 7 to a typewritten copy DRAF T RESOLUTIO N ON FREEDO M OF THE PRES S113 For the bourgeoisie, freedom of the press meant freedom for the rich to publish and for the capitalists to control the newspapers, a practice which in all countries, includingeven the freest, produced a corrupt press. 
 For the workers’ and peasants’ government, freedom of the press means liberation of the press from capitalist oppression, and public ownership of paper mills and printing presses; equal right for public groups of a certain size (say,numbering 10,000) to a fair share of newsprint stocks anda corresponding quantity of printers’ labour. 
 As a first step towards this goal, which is bound up with the working people’s liberation from capitalist oppression, the Provisional Workers’ and Peasants’ Government has appointed a Commission of Inquiry to look into the tiesbetween capital and periodicals, the sources of their fundsand revenues, the list of their donors, covers for their deficits,and every other aspect of the newspaper business in general. 
Concealment of books, accounts or any other documents from the Commission of Inquiry, or the giving of any evidence known to be false shall be punishable by a revolutionarycourt. 
 All newspaper owners, shareholders, and all members of their staffs shall be under the obligation to immediatelysubmit written reports and information on the said questions to the Commission of Inquiry , probing the ties between cap-ital and the press, and its dependence on capital, at Smolny Institute, Petrograd. 
 The following are appointed to serve on the Commission of Inquiry: * The Commission shall have the power to co-opt members, call experts, subpoena witnesses, order the presentation ofall accounts, etc.

 MEETING OF THE ALL-RUSSIA CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE NOVEMBER 4 (17), 1917 1 SPEECH ON THE PRESS Comrade Karelin assured us that the way he was taking led to socialism, but I am afraid this would be marching tosocialism backwards. 
 Trotsky was right: the officer cadetsstaged their uprising, and war was declared in Petrogradand Moscow for freedom of the press. 
 This time the Socialist-Revolutionaries did not act at all like socialists or revolu-tionaries. 
 This week all the telegraph offices were inKerensky’s hands. 
 The Vikzhel was on their side. 
 But theyhad no troops. 
 It turned out that the army was on our side. 
The civil war was started by a handful of men. 
 It is not over. 
Kaledin’s troops are approaching Moscow, and the shock troops are approaching Petrograd. 
 We do not want a civil war. 
 Our troops have shown great restraint. 
 They heldtheir fire, and it all began when three of our men were killed. 
Krasnov was given soft treatment. 
 He was only placed underhouse arrest. 
 We are against civil war. 
 But if it neverthelessgoes on what are we to do? Trotsky was right in asking in whose behalf you spoke? We asked Krasnov whether he could sign on behalf of Kaledin that the latter would not continuethe war. 
 He naturally replied that he could not. 
 How canwe stop retaliative measures against an enemy who has notstopped his hostile operations? We shall negotiate when peace terms are offered to us. 
 But so far peace is being offered to us by those on whom it does not depend. 
 These are only fine words. 
 After all,Rech is an organ of the Kaledinites. 
 We can well allow that the Socialist-Revolutionaries are sincere, but it is, after all, a fact that Kaledin and Milyukov are behind them. 
 The firmer your stand, soldiers and workers, the more we shall gain. 
 Otherwise they will say to us: “If they’velet out Milyukov, they can’t be strong. 
” Earlier on we saidthat if we took power, we intended to close down the bour-geois newspapers. 
 To tolerate the existence of these papersis to cease being a socialist. 
 Those who say: “Open the bour-geois newspapers”, fail to understand that we are moving at full speed to socialism. 
 After all, tsarist newspaperswere closed down after the overthrow of tsarism. 
 Now wehave thrown off the bourgeois yoke. 
 We did not invent thesocial revolution: it was proclaimed by the Congress of theSoviets—no one protested, all adopted the decree proclaim-ing it. 
 The bourgeoisie proclaimed liberty, equality and fraternity. 
 The workers say: “We want something else. 
”We are told that we are retreating. 
 No, comrades, it is theSocialist-Revolutionaries who are returning to Kerensky. 
We are told that there are new elements in our resolution. 
Of course there are, because we are advancing to socialism. 
 When the Socialist-Revolutionaries made speeches in the First and the Second Duma, they were also ridiculed forsaying something new. 
 There should be a monopoly of private advertisements. 
 The members of the printers’ union look at them from thepoint of view of income. 
 They will get it, but in another form. 
 We cannot provide the bourgeoisie with an opportu-nity for slandering us. 
 We must appoint a commission rightaway to probe the ties between the banks and the bourgeoisnewspapers. 
 What kind of freedom do these newspaperswant? Isn’t it freedom to buy rolls of newsprint and hirecrowds of penpushers? We must escape from the freedom of a press dependent on capital. 
 This is a matter of principle. 
 If we are to advance to socialism we cannot allow Kaledin’sbombs to be reinforced by the bombs of falsehood. 
 Of course, our draft law is not perfect. 
 But it will be applied everywhere by the Soviets in accordance with theirlocal conditions. 
 We are not bureaucrats and do not want to insist on the letter of the law everywhere, as was the prac-tice in the old government offices. 
 I recall the Socialist-Revolutionaries saying that people in the countryside knew so very little. 
 They were getting their information from Russkoye Slovo . 
 We should blame ourselves for leaving the newspapers in the hands of the bourgeoisie. 
 We must go forward, to a new society, and take the same attitude to thebourgeois newspapers as we did to the ultra-reactionarypapers in February and March. 
 2 REPLY TO A QUESTION THE LEFT SOCIALIST -REVOLUTIONARIES The Left Socialist-Revolutionaries’ question was answered by Lenin. 
114 He recalled that in the first days of the revo-lution the Bolsheviks invited the Left Socialist-Revolu-tionaries to join the new government, but the group of LeftSocialist-Revolutionaries, who refused to share responsi-bility in those difficult, critical days with their neighbourson the Left, declined to collaborate with the Bolsheviks. 
 In its activity the new regime could not afford to reckon with all the obstacles which could arise in its way if itscrupulously observed all formalities. 
 The situation wasmuch too grave and allowed of no procrastination. 
 Therewas no time to waste on smoothing off rough corners thatmerely changed outward appearances without altering the essence of the new measures. 
 After all, the Second All-Russia Congress of Soviets itself, brushing aside all difficul-ties of a formal nature, adopted two laws of world impor-tance at one long sitting. 
 These laws may have formaldefects from the standpoint of bourgeois society, but poweris, after all, in the hands of the Soviets, which can always make the necessary amendments. 
 The Kerensky govern-ment’s criminal failure to act brought the country and therevolution to the brink of disaster: delay may indeed proveto be fatal, and the new regime is setting up milestones inthe development of new forms of life by issuing laws to meetthe aspirations and hopes of the broad masses. 
 The local Soviets, depending on time and place, can amend, enlarge and add to the basic provisions worked out by the govern-ment. 
 Creative activity at the grass roots is the basic factor of the new public life. 
 Let the workers set up workers’ control at their factories. 
 Let them supply the villages with manufactures in exchange for grain. 
 Account must be taken of every single article, every pound of grain, because whatsocialism implies above all is keeping account of everything. 
Socialism cannot be decreed from above. 
 Its spirit rejects themechanical bureaucratic approach; living, creative socialismis the product of the masses themselves. 
 3 SPEECHES CONCERNING THE LEFT SOCIALIST -REVOLUTIONARIES’ QUESTION I Lenin examines the concrete charges made against the Council of People’s Commissars. 
 It first learned of Mura-vyov’s order 115 from the press, because the Commander-in-Chief had the power to issue emergency orders on his own authority. 
 In view of the fact that the order did not contain anything clashing with the spirit of the new power, but wasso worded that it could lead to undesirable misunderstand-ings, the Central Executive Committee has rescinded it. 
Furthermore, you criticise the Decree on Land. 
 But it meetsthe demands of the people. 
 You accuse us of schematising, but where are your own drafts, amendments and resolu-tions? Where are the fruits of your legislative activity? Youwere free to produce them. 
 But we see nothing of them. 
 Yousay we are extremists, but who are you? You are apologistsfor the sort of parliamentary obstruction that used to beknown as scandal-mongering. 
 If you are dissatisfied, why don’t you call another congress and act, but don’t talk about the collapse of power. 
 Power is in the hands of ourParty, which enjoys the confidence of the broad masses. 
Some of our comrades may have adopted a platform whichhas nothing in common with Bolshevism. 
 But the mass ofMoscow workers will not follow Rykov and Nogin. 
 Comrade Proshyan said that in Finland, where the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries were in touch with the mass, they believedthere was need for the closest collaboration within theentire Left wing of revolutionary socialism. 
 The fact that the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries are not with us here merely shows that they have gone the way of their prede-cessors, the defencists. 
 They have lost the common touch. 
 II Lenin and Trotsky, referring to the example of the Party congresses and the need for them to submit to Party discipline, announce that they will take part in the voting. 
 4 SPEECH AND RESOLUTION ON THE RESIGNATION OF A GROUP OF PEOPLE’S COMMISSARS THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE’S COMMISSARS Comrade Lenin replies to the preceding speakers. 
 He says no internationalist can use the expression: “The West is disgracefully silent. 
”116 Only the blind fail to see the fer-ment among the working masses in Germany and the West. 
The top sections of the German proletariat and the socialistintelligentsia there, as everywhere else, are mostly defencists. 
But the lower strata of the proletariat are prepared to respond to our call in defiance of the will of their leaders. 
 The fierce discipline of the German army and navy failed toprevent action by the opposition elements. 
 The revolution-ary sailors of the German navy, fully aware that theirattempt was doomed, boldly went to their death in order towaken the spirit of revolt still dormant among the people. 
 The Spartacus group 117 is intensifying its revolutionary propaganda. 
 The name of Liebknecht, a tireless fighterfor proletarian ideals, is daily gaining in popularity inGermany. 
 We believe in the revolution in the West. 
 We know that it is inevitable, but it cannot, of course, be made to order. 
 Did we know last December what exactly would happen in the coming February? Did we, in September, know withany certitude at all that within a month the revolutionarydemocrats of Russia would carry out the world’s greatestrevolution? We were aware that the old power was on top ofa volcano. 
 Many signs told us of the great work going on deep down in people’s minds. 
 We felt that the air was charged with electricity. 
 We were sure that it wouldinevitably explode in a purifying thunderstorm. 
 But we could not predict the day and hour. 
 We now see the same picture in Germany. 
 There, too, there is a swelling under-current of dissatisfaction which will inevitably take the forms of a popular movement. 
 We cannot decree a revolu-tion, but we can help it along. 
 We shall conduct organisedfraternisation in the trenches and help the peoples of theWest to start an invincible socialist revolution. 
 ComradeZaks further spoke about decreeing socialism. 
 But doesn’t the present government urge the masses to create better forms of life themselves? You have the beginnings ofsocialism in the exchange of manufactured goods for grain,and the strict control and accounting of production. 
 We aresure we are going to have a republic of labour. 
 He who willnot work, will have to go without food. 
 But to continue: what is the sign of our Party’s isolation? It is the breakaway of a few intellectuals. 
 But we dailyfind more and more support among the peasants. 
 Victorywill belong only to those who have faith in the people, thosewho are immersed in the life-giving spring of popularcreativity. 
 Comrade Lenin then proposes to the Central Executive Committee the following resolution: The Central Executive Committee authorises the Council of People’s Commissars to nominate, by the next sitting,candidates for the People’s Commissars of the Interior, andTrade and Industry, and invites Comrade Kolegayev to fill the post of People’s Commissar of Agriculture. 
 Izvestia No. 
 218, Published according to the Izvestia November 7, 1917 text; Resolution on the resignation, according to the text of Minutes of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee of Soviets of Workers ’, Soldiers ’, Peasants ’ and Cossacks ’ Deputies , Second Convocation , Moscow, 1918 SPEECH AT A JOINT MEETING OF THE PETROGRAD SOVIET OF WORKERS’ AND SOLDIERS’ DEPUTIES AND DELEGATES THE FRONTS NOVEMBER 4 (17), 1917 NEWSPAPER REPORT I am unable to make a long speech; I can merely outline the new government’s position, programme and tasks. 
 You are aware that there was a unanimous demand for a policy of peace, for an immediate offer of peace. 
 There isnot a single bourgeois minister in the whole of Europe, including this country, who has not promised peace; the soldiers of Russia have found these speeches to be false;they were promised a policy of peace, but no peace wasoffered and instead they were driven into an offensive. 
 Webelieved it to be our government’s first duty to offer animmediate peace, and this has been done. 
 Comrade Lenin sets forth the terms on which the new government has proposed peace, and adds: If the powerskeep their colonies, there will never be an end to this war. 
What is the way out? There is only one: it is for the workers’and peasants’ revolution to defeat capital. 
 We never promisedthat the war could be ended at one stroke, by driving bayonets into ground. 
 War springs from the clash of fortunes running to thousands of millions, which havedivided up the world, and if the war is to be brought to anend, the power of capital must be destroyed. 
 Comrade Lenin speaks on the transfer of power to the Soviets, and declares that we have witnessed a new phenomenon: the peasants refuse to believe that all power belongs to the Soviets, they are still expecting somethingelse from the government and forget that the Soviet is not aprivate but a state institution. 
 We declare that we want anew state, that the Soviet must replace the old officialdom,and that all the people must learn to govern. 
 You should stand up to your full stature and straighten your backs, and then you need have no fear of threats. 
 The officer cadets tried to engineer an uprising but we were able to deal with them; they organised a bloodbath in Moscow and shot soldiers on theKremlin wall. 
 But when the people won out, they let the ene-my keep not only their military honour but also their arms. 
 The Vikzhel has threatened a strike, but we shall turn to the masses and ask them whether they want to go on strike and starve the soldiers at the front and the people in the rear, and I am sure that the railway proletariat won’t have it. 
 Weare accused of making arrests. 
 Indeed, we have made arrests;today we arrested the director of the State Bank. 
 We areaccused of resorting to terrorism, but we have not resorted,and I hope will not resort, to the terrorism of the French revolutionaries who guillotined unarmed men. 
 I hope we shall not resort to it, because we have strength on our side. 
When we arrested anyone we told him we would let him goif he gave us a written promise not to engage in sabotage. 
Such written promises have been given. 
 Our fault is that theSoviet organisation has not yet learned to govern, and that there are far too many meetings. 
 Let the Soviets form teams and get down to the business of government. 
 Our task is toadvance to socialism. 
 A few days ago the workers receivedthe law on the control of production 118 which makes the factory committee a state institution. 
 The workers mustimplement this law immediately. 
 They will supply the peas-ants with cloth and iron, and the peasants will give them grain. 
 I just saw a comrade from Ivanovo-Voznesensk, and he toldme this was the main thing. 
 Socialism means keeping accountof everything. 
 You will have socialism if you take stock ofevery piece of iron and cloth. 
 We need engineers for produc-tion, and we value their labour highly. 
 We shall be glad to pay them. 
 We do not intend, at the moment, to deprive them of their privileged position. 
 We value everyone whois willing to work but he must not behave as a boss but asan equal, under workers’ control. 
 We have no feeling ofanimosity for individuals, and we shall try to help them fitinto the new pattern. 
 As for the peasants we say: help the working peasant, spare the middle peasant, compel the rich peasant to pay. 
After the October 25 Revolution we were threatened with destruction. 
 Some were scared and wanted to escape power, but we were not destroyed. 
 This was because our enemies could find support only from the officer cadets, whereas we had the people on our side. 
 But for the massive driveby the soldiers and workers, power would never have droppedfrom the hands that held it. 
 Power passed to the Soviets,which are organisations giving the people full freedom. 
 We,the Soviet Government, have received our powers from the Congress of Soviets and, confident of your support, we shall continue to act as we have acted. 
 We have not excludedanyone. 
 The Mensheviks and the Socialist-Revolutionarieshave gone, but that is a crime on their part. 
 We invitedthe Left Socialist-Revolutionaries to take part in the govern-ment, but they refused. 
 We do not want any bargaining over power, we don’t want any bids or counterbids. 
 We shall keep the City Council away from power because it isa Kornilovite centre. 
 Some say we are isolated. 
 The bour-geoisie has surrounded us with an atmosphere of lies andslander, but I have yet to see the soldier who is not enthusias-tic over the Soviets having taken power. 
 I have yet to see the peasant who opposes the Soviets. 
 There must be an alliance of the poor peasants and the workers, and socialism willtriumph the world over.

 181, Published according November 18 (5), 1917 to the Pravda text TO THE POPULATION Comrades—workers, soldiers, peasants and all working people! The workers’ and peasants’ revolution has definitely triumphed in Petrograd, having dispersed or arrested thelast remnants of the small number of Cossacks deceived byKerensky. 
 The revolution has triumphed in Moscow too. 
Even before the arrival of a number of troop trains dispatched from Petrograd, the officer cadets and other Kornilovites in Moscow signed peace terms—the disarming of the cadetsand the dissolution of the Committee of Salvation. 
 119 Daily and hourly reports are coming in from the front and from the villages announcing the support of the over-whelming majority of the soldiers in the trenches and the peasants in the uyezds for the new government and its decrees on peace and the immediate transfer of the land to the peas-ants. 
 The victory of the workers’ and peasants’ revolutionis assured because the majority of the people have alreadysided with it. 
 It is perfectly understandable that the landowners and capitalists, and the top groups of office employees and civil servants closely linked with the bourgeoisie, in a word, allthe wealthy and those supporting them, react to the newrevolution with hostility, resist its victory, threaten toclose the banks, disrupt or bring to a standstill the work ofthe different establishments, and hamper the revolution in every way, openly or covertly. 
 Every politically-conscious worker was well aware that we would inevitably en-counter resistance of this kind. 
 The entire Party press of /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR the Bolsheviks has written about this on numerous occa-sions. 
 Not for a single minute will the working classes be intimidated by this resistance; they will not falter in any way before the threats and strikes of the supporters of thebourgeoisie. 
 The majority of the people are with us. 
 The majority of the working and oppressed people all over the world are withus. 
 Ours is the cause of justice. 
 Our victory is assured. 
 The resistance of the capitalists and the high-ranking em-ployees will be smashed. 
 Not a single person will be deprivedof his property except under the special state law proclaim-ing nationalisation of the banks and syndicates. 
 This lawis being drafted. 
 Not one of the working people will sufferthe loss of a kopek; on the contrary, he will be helped. 
 Apart from the strictest accounting and control, apart from levy-ing the set taxes in full the government has no intention ofintroducing any other measure. 
 In support of these just demands the vast majority of the people have rallied round the Provisional Workers’ andPeasants’ Government. 
 Comrades, working people! Remember that now you yourselves are at the helm of state. 
 No one will help you if you yourselves do not unite and take into your hands all affairs of the state. 
 Your Soviets are from now on the organs of state authority, legislative bodies with full powers. 
 Rally around your Soviets. 
 Strengthen them. 
 Get on with the job yourselves; begin right at the bottom, do not wait for anyone. 
 Establish the strictest revolutionary lawand order, mercilessly suppress any attempts to createanarchy by drunkards, hooligans, counter-revolutionaryofficer cadets, Kornilovites and their like. 
 Ensure the strictest control over production and account-ing of products. 
 Arrest and hand over to the revolutionary courts all who dare to injure the people’s cause, irrespectiveof whether the injury is manifested in sabotaging production(damage, delay and subversion), or in hoarding grain andproducts or holding up shipments of grain, disorganising therailways and the postal, telegraph and telephone services, or any resistance whatever to the great cause of peace, the cause of transferring the land to the peasants, of ensuring workers’control over the production and distribution of products. 
 Comrades, workers, soldiers, peasants and all working people! Take all power into the hands of your Soviets. 
 Be watchful and guard like the apple of your eye your land, grain, factories, equipment, products, transport—all thatfrom now onwards will be entirely your property, public property. 
 Gradually, with the consent and approval of themajority of the peasants, in keeping with their practical experience and that of the workers, we shall go forward firmly and unswervingly to the victory of socialism—a victory that will be sealed by the advanced workers of themost civilised countries, bring the peoples lasting peaceand liberate them from all oppression and exploitation.

 4, Published according (evening edition) to the manuscript November 19 (6), 1917 REPLY TO QUESTION S FRO M PEASANT S120 In reply to numerous questions from peasants, be it known that all power in the country henceforth belongs wholly to the Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’ Depu-ties. 
 The workers’ revolution has won in Petrograd andMoscow and is winning everywhere else in Russia. 
 TheWorkers’ and Peasants’ Government ensures the alliance ofthe mass of the peasants, the poor peasants, the majority of the peasants, with the workers against the landowners, against the capitalists. 
 Hence the Soviets of Peasants’ Deputies, primarily the uyezd and then the gubernia Soviets, are from now on, pend-ing the convocation of the Constituent Assembly, vestedwith full governmental authority in their localities. 
 Landed proprietorship has been abolished by the Second All-Russia Congress of Soviets. 
 A decree on land has already been issued by the present Provisional Workers’ and Peasants’ Govern-ment. 
 In conformity with this decree all landed estates passover wholly to the Soviets of Peasants’ Deputies. 
 The volost land committees must at once take over the administration of all landed estates, instituting the strictestaccounting, maintaining-perfect order and safeguardingwith utmost strictness the former property of the landowners,which henceforth is the property of the whole people andwhich the people themselves must therefore protect. 
 All rulings of the volost land committees issued with the approval of the uyezd Soviets of Peasants’ Deputies havethe force of law and must be carried out unconditionally and without delay. 
 The Workers’ and Peasants’ Government appointed by the Second All-Russia Congress of Soviets has been named the Council of People’s Commissars. 
 The Council of People’s Commissars calls upon the peasants to take all power into their own hands in theirrespective localities. 
 The workers give their full, undivided,all-round support to the peasants, are getting the produc-tion of machines and implements started, and ask the peasants to help by delivering grain.

 219, Published according November 8, 1917 to the manuscript THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE RUSSIAN SOCIAL -DEMOCRATIC LABOUR PARTY (BOLSHEVIKS ) To Comrades Kamenev, Zinoviev, Ryazanov and Larin Once before, the Central Committee delivered an ultima-tum to the leading exponents of your policy (Kamenevand Zinoviev), demanding complete subordination to theCentral Committee’s line and decisions, and renunciation of efforts to sabotage its work and of all subversive activity. 
 * By leaving the Central Committee, but remaining in the Party, the exponents of your policy undertook to abideby Central Committee decisions. 
 Actually, however, youhave not confined yourselves to criticism within the Party, but have brought confusion into the ranks of the fighters in an uprising which is still going on, andcontinue, in violation of Party discipline, to frustrateCentral Committee decisions and hamper its work outsidethe Party, in the Soviets, the municipal bodies, the tradeunions, etc. 
 In view of this, the Central Committee is forced to restate its ultimatum and to request that you immediately pledgeyourselves in writing either to abide by Central Committeedecisions and to conduct its policy in all your statements,or to withdraw from all Party activity in public and resignfrom all responsible posts in the working-class movement until the next Party congress. 
 *See pp. 
 280-82 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 Refusal to pledge yourselves to either course will make it imperative for the Central Committee to consider the question of your immediate expulsion from the Party. 
 Written on November 5 or 6 (18 or 19), 1917 First published in 1927 , Published according in the pamphlet The Party ’s Fight to the manuscript Against Zinoviev ’s and Kamenev ’s Strike-breaking Tactics in October 1917 THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE RUSSIAN SOCIAL -DEMOCRATIC LABOUR PARTY (BOLSHEVIKS ) TO ALL PARTY MEMBERS AND TO ALL THE WORKING CLASSES OF RUSSIA Comrades, It is a matter of common knowledge that the majority at the Second All-Russia Congress of Soviets of Workers’and Soldiers’ Deputies were delegates belonging to the Bol-shevik Party. 
 This fact is fundamental for a proper understanding of the victorious revolution that has just taken place in Petrograd, Moscow and the whole of Russia. 
 Yet that fact is constantly forgotten and ignored by all the supporters ofthe capitalists and their unwitting aides, who are under-mining the fundamental principle of the new revolution,namely, all power to the Soviets . 
 There must be no govern-ment in Russia other than the Soviet Government . 
 Soviet power has been won in Russia, and the transfer of govern-ment from one Soviet party to another is guaranteed withoutany revolution, simply by a decision of the Soviets; simplyby new elections of deputies to the Soviets. 
 The majority atthe Second All-Russia Congress of Soviets belonged to theBolshevik Party. 
 Therefore the only Soviet Government is the one formed by that Party. 
 And everybody knows that the Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party, several hoursprior to the formation of the new government, and to thepresentation of the list of its members to the Second All-Russia Congress of Soviets, summoned to its session threeof the most prominent members of the group of Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, Comrades Kamkov, Spiro and Karelin, and invited them to join the new government. 
 We very much regret that the Left Socialist-Revolutionary comrades refused; we regard their refusal as impermissible on the part of revolutionaries and champions of the working people. 
 We are ready at any moment to include Left Socialist-Revolutionaries in the government, but we declare that,as the majority party at the Second All-Russia Congressof Soviets, we are entitled to form the government, and it is our duty to the people to do so. 
 Everybody knows that the Central Committee of our Party submitted a purely Bolshevik list of People’s Com-missars to the Second All-Russia Congress of Soviets, andthat the Congress approved this list of a purely Bolshevik government. 
 The statements to the effect that the Bolshevik govern-ment is not a Soviet Government are therefore pure lies, and come, and can come, only from the enemies of the people, from the enemies of Soviet power. 
 On the contrary, now,after the Second All-Russia Congress of Soviets, and untilthe Third Congress meets, or until new elections to the So-viets are held, or until a new government is formed by theCentral Executive Committee, only a Bolshevik government can be regarded as the Soviet Government. 
 * * * Comrades, yesterday, November 4, several members of the Central Committee of our Party and of the Council of People’s Commissars—Kamenev, Zinoviev, Nogin, Rykov, Milyutin and a few others—resigned from the Central Com-mittee of our Party, and the three last named from the Coun-cil of People’s Commissars. 
 In a large party like ours, not-withstanding the proletarian and revolutionary line of ourpolicy, it was inevitable that individual comrades should have proved to be insufficiently staunch and firm in the struggle against the enemies of the people. 
 The tasks thatnow face our Party are really immense, the difficulties areenormous, and several members of our Party who formerlyheld posts of responsibility have flinched in face of theonslaught of the bourgeoisie and fled from our ranks. 
 The bourgeoisie and all its helpers are jubilant over this fact and are maliciously rejoicing, clamouring about disintegrationand predicting the fall of the Bolshevik government. 
 Comrades, do not believe these lies. 
 The comrades who have resigned have acted as deserters, since they not only quitted the posts entrusted to them, but violated the direct decision of the Central Committee of our Party binding themto delay their resignation at least until a decision was takenby the Petrograd and Moscow Party organisations. 
 Westrongly condemn this desertion. 
 We are profoundly con-vinced that all class-conscious workers, soldiers and peasants who belong to or sympathise with our Party will condemn the actions of the deserters with equal severity. 
 But we declare that the desertion of a few individuals belonging to the leading group of our Party cannot for amoment or in the slightest way shake the unity of themasses who follow our Party and that it therefore will not shake our Party. 
 You must recall, comrades, that two of the deserters, Kamenev and Zinoviev, acted as deserters and blacklegseven before the Petrograd uprising; for they not only votedagainst the uprising at the decisive meeting of the CentralCommittee on October 10, 1917, but, even after the decision had been taken by the Central Committee, agitated among the Party workers against the uprising. 
 It is common knowl-edge that newspapers which fear to take the side of theworkers and are more inclined to side with the bourgeoisie(e. 
g. 
, Novaya Zhizn ), raised at that time, in common with the whole bourgeois press, a hue and cry about the “dis-integration” of our Party, about “the collapse of the uprising” and so on. 
 Events, however, swiftly refuted the lies andslanders of some and the doubts, waverings and cowardiceof others: The “storm” they tried to raise over the effortsof Kamenev and Zinoviev to thwart the Petrograd uprisingproved to be a storm in a teacup , while the great enthusiasm of the people, the great heroism of millions of workers, soldiers, and peasants in Petrograd, in Moscow, at the front,in the trenches and in the villages, pushed the deserters outof the way as easily as a railway train pushes aside splintersof wood. 
 Shame on all the faint-hearted, all the waverers and doubters, on all those who allowed themselves to be in-timidated by the bourgeoisie or who have succumbed tothe outcries of their direct and indirect supporters! There is not the slightest hesitation among the mass of the workers and soldiers of Petrograd, Moscow and other places. 
 Our Party stands solidly and firmly, as one man, in defence of Soviet power, in defence of the interests of all the workingpeople, and first and foremost of the workers and poorpeasants. 
 Bourgeois hacks and those who allowed themselves to be intimidated by the bourgeoisie accuse us in chorus of being uncompromising, of being irreconcilable, of refusing to share power with another party. 
 That is not true, comrades. 
We have invited and continue to invite the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries to share power with us. 
 It is not our faultthat they have refused . 
 We began the negotiations, and, after the delegates of the Second Congress of Soviets had dispersed, we made all kinds of concessions in the course of these negotiations, even to the point of provisionally agreeingto admit representatives of a section of the Petrograd CityCouncil, that nest of Kornilov men, which will be the firstto be swept away by the people should the Kornilovitescoundrels, should the darling sons of the capitalists and landowners, the officer cadets, attempt once more to resist the will of the people as they did last Sunday in Petrogradand as they would like to do again (as is proved by theexposure of the conspiracy of Purishkevich and the documentsseized on him yesterday, November 3). 
 But the gentlemenwho stand behind the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries and act through them in the interests of the bourgeoisie inter-preted our readiness to make concessions as weakness, andtook advantage of this readiness to present us with newultimatums. 
 At the conference on November 3, Mr. 
 Abra-movich and Mr. 
 Martov appeared and presented an ulti-matum: no negotiations until our government puts a stop to the arrests and to the suppression of bourgeois newspapers. 
 Both our Party and the Central Executive Committee of the Congress of Soviets refused to accept this ultimatum, which obviously emanated from the supporters of Kaledin,the bourgeoisie, Kerensky and Kornilov. 
 The conspiracy ofPurishkevich and the appearance in Petrograd on November 5 of a delegation from a unit of the 17th Army Corps threat-ening us with a march on Petrograd (a ridiculous threat, forthe advanced detachments of these Kornilovites have already been beaten and have fled at Gatchina, while most of them have refused to fight against the Soviets)—all these events have proved who were the real authors of the ultimatum of Mr. 
 Abramovich and Mr. 
 Martov and whomthese people really served. 
 Let the working people, therefore, remain calm and firm! Our Party will never yield to the ultimatums of the minorityin the Soviets, the minority who have allowed themselves to be intimidated by the bourgeoisie and, despite their “good intentions” virtually act as puppets in the hands ofthe Kornilov gang. 
 We stand firmly by the principle of Soviet power, i. 
e. 
, the power of the majority obtained at the last Congress of Soviets. 
 We agreed, and still agree , to share power with the minority in the Soviets, provided that minority loyally and honestly undertake to submit to the majority and carryout the programme, approved by the whole Second All-Russia Congress of Soviets, for gradual, but firm and undeviatingsteps towards socialism. 
 But we shall not submit to anyultimatums of groups of intellectuals who are not backed by the people, and who in actual fact are backed only by the Kornilovites, the Savinkov men, the officer cadets, etc. 
 Let the working people, therefore, remain calm and firm! Our Party, the party of the Soviet majority, stands solidand united in defence of their interests and, as before,behind our Party stand the millions of the workers in the cities, the soldiers in the trenches and the peasants in the villages, prepared at all costs to achieve the victory of peaceand the victory of socialism!

 Could you tell us whether you have received a wireless message from the Council of People’s Commissars sent at 4. 
00 o’clock, and what has been done to carry out the instructions of the Council of People’s Commissars? Field H. 
 Q. 
 replying: An undated and unnumbered message of state importance was received, and that is why General Dukhonin requested General Manikovsky for the necessary guarantees confirmingits authenticity. 
 What was Manikovsky’s reply, at what time was the query sent, and was it radioed, telephoned or telegraphed? Field H. 
 Q.

 Please specify the time and means used in sending the first query. 
 Will you hurry up, please? Field H.

 The People’s Commissars here; what’s your answer? I see from the tape I just got of your conversation with G. 
H. 
Q. 
 that your message to me was sent before any decision was taken onthe substance of the message signed by the People’s CommissarsUlyanov-Lenin, Trotsky and Krylenko; in view of this I must havethe following factual information: (1) Has the Council of People’s Commissars received any reply to its message to the belligerent powers containing the Decree on Peace; (2) What was to be done with theRumanian Army, which is a part of our front; (3) Was there any inten-tion of engaging in talks about a separate armistice and with whomonly with the Germans or with the Turks, or are we to negotiatea general armistice? The text of the message sent to you is absolutely clear and to the point; it speaks of an immediate opening of armi-stice talks with all the belligerents, and we resolutely denythe right to delay this matter of state importance by anypreliminary queries whatsoever; we insist that truce envoys should be dispatched immediately and that we receive progress reports every hour. 
 Field H. 
 Q. 
 replying: My questions are of a purely technical char-acter and unless they are answered it will be impossible to negotiate. 
 You must be aware that many technical, rather detailed questions will arise during the talks, and we shall answerthem as they arise or are raised by the enemy; that is whywe demand once again, in the form of an ultimatum, thatformal armistice negotiations be started unconditionallyand without delay with all the belligerent countries, both Allied and those hostile to us. 
 Please state your reply in precise terms. 
 I can understand only one thing, and it is that you cannot nego-tiate directly with the powers. 
 It is even less possible for me to do so on your behalf. 
 Only a central government supported by the army and the nation can have enough prestige and importance for theenemy to lend these negotiations the authority necessary to achieveresults. 
 I also believe that an early conclusion of a general peaceis in Russia’s interests. 
 Do you flatly refuse to give us a precise reply and carry out our orders? I have given you a precise reply as to the reasons why I find it impossible to put your message into effect, and I repeat that thepeace Russia needs can be obtained only by a central government. 
 Dukhonin. 
 In the name of the Government of the Russian Republic, on behalf of the Council of People’s Commissars, we dismiss you from your post for refusing to obey government ordersand for conduct that entails untold hardships for the workingpeople of all countries and especially the armies.

 This message was received at Field Headquarters on November 8 at 5. 
05 a. 
m. 
 Dukhonin was ordered to keep theCouncil of People’s Commissars constantly informed of the progress of the negotiations and to sign the armistice agree-ment only after it had been approved by the Council ofPeople’s Commissars. 
 Simultaneously, a similar proposalto conclude an armistice was formally submitted to all theplenipotentiary representatives of the Allied countries inPetrograd. 
 Not having received a reply from Dukhonin by the eve-ning of November 8, the Council of People’s Commissarsempowered Lenin, Stalin and Krylenko to ascertain thecauses of the delay from Dukhonin over the direct line. 
 The conversation lasted from 2 a.

 to 4.

 Dukhonin made numerous attempts to evade giving an explanation of his conduct and a precise reply to the orders of the government, but when Dukhonin was givena categorical order to enter immediately into formal nego-tiations for an armistice, he refused to obey. 
 Thereupon,in the name of the Government of the Russian Republic, onbehalf of the Council of People’s Commissars, Dukhonin was informed that he was dismissed from his post for refusing to obey government orders and for conduct that entaileduntold hardships for the working people of all countries and especially for the armies. 
 At the same time, Dukhonin was ordered to continue his duties pending the arrival of a new Commander-in-Chief or a person empowered by the latter to take over from Dukhonin. 
 Ensign Krylenko has beenappointed the new Commander-in-Chief. 
 Soldiers, the cause of peace is in your hands! Do not allow the counter-revolutionary generals to frustrate thegreat cause of peace, place them under guard in order to avert acts of summary justice unworthy of a revolutionary army and to prevent these generals from escaping the trialthat awaits them. 
 Maintain the strictest revolutionary andmilitary order. 
 Let the regiments at the front immediately elect repre-sentatives to start formal negotiations for an armistice with the enemy. 
 The Council of People’s Commissars authorises you to do this. 
 Do everything possible to keep us informed of every step in the negotiations. 
 The Council of People’s Commissarsis alone authorised to sign the final armistice agreement. 
 Soldiers, the cause of peace is in your hands! Maintain vigilance, restraint and energy, and the cause of peace willtriumph! In the name of the Government of the Russian Republic V.

 20,t o the newspaper text November 9 (22), 1917 FOREWORD TO THE PAMPHLET , HOW THE SOCIALIST-REVOLUTIONARIES CHEATED THE PEOPLE, AND WHAT THE NEW BOLSHEVIK GOVERNMENT HAS GIVEN THE PEOPLE The peasants of Russia are now faced with the prospect of taking their country’s destiny into their own hands. 
 The victory of the workers’ revolution in the two leading cities and in most of the rest of Russia has given the peasantsthe possibility of taking the land arrangements into their own hands. 
 Not all peasants have as yet realised that their Soviets of Peasants’ Deputies are the true, authentic,supreme state power, but they soon will. 
 When they do realise it, their alliance with the workers, the alliance of the bulk of the peasants—the poor, workingpeasants—will be consolidated. 
 This alliance, both in the Soviets and the Constituent Assembly, and not the allianceof the peasants and the capitalists, is the only one reallycapable of ensuring the working people’s interests. 
 It will surely very soon be brought home to the peasants that if they are to be rid of the horrors of war and the oppres-sion of the landowners and capitalists, they must ally them-selves with the working people of the towns, above all thefactory workers, and not with the rich. 
 If the peasants are to see this soon, they must, among other things, make a closer and more amply documented comparison of the promises and draft laws of the Socialist-Revolutionaries, and the Decree on Land issued by the new,workers’ and peasants’ government. 
 Such a comparison is made in this pamphlet. 
 It gives the documents , which is the first thing anyone needs if he is going to use his head. 
 The main document relating to the Socialist-Revolutionaries is their Minister Maslov’sdraft land law. 
 I take it in full from Dyelo Naroda (Cher-nov’s newspaper). 
 I am also republishing in full my own article on the subject from Rabochy Put . 
* The Decree on Land issued by the workers’ and peasants’ government is also given in full. 
 ** Peasant comrades, seek the truth about the various parties, and you shall find it! Collect and compare thedraft land laws proposed by the various parties. 
 You must read carefully the draft land law put forward by the Socialist-Revolutionary minister, and the Decree on Land issued by the present Bolshevik government, whichreceived its powers from the Second All-Russia Congress ofSoviets. 
 We have no doubt at all as to what the peasants’final conclusion will be.

 MEETING OF THE ALL-RUSSIA CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, NOVEMBER 10 (23), 1917 1 REPORT ON TALKS WITH DUKHONIN The full text of our talks with Dukhonin has been printed, so I can confine myself to a few remarks. 
 It was clear to usthat we were dealing with an opponent of the people’swill and an enemy of the revolution. 
 Dukhonin resorted toall manner of shifts and dodges to delay matters. 
 Doubt was expressed as to the authenticity of our message, and the query was not addressed to Krylenko but to General Mani-kovsky. 
 Thus, the generals have stolen at least one full dayin this important and vital matter of peace. 
 General Du-khonin came to the apparatus only when we said we wouldrefer the matter to the soldiers. 
 We told Dukhonin of our demand that he should start armistice negotiations immedi-ately, and nothing more. 
 Dukhonin was not empowered toconclude an armistice. 
 Not only was the conclusion of anarmistice outside Dukhonin’s competence, but his everystep in the matter of the armistice negotiations was to havebeen under the control of the People’s Commissars. 
 The bourgeois press has accused us of offering a separate armistice and of ignoring the interests of the Rumanian Army. 
 Thatis a lie. 
 We propose that the peace talks should be startedimmediately, and an armistice concluded with all countries,without exception. 
 We have information that our wirelessmessages have been reaching Europe. 
 Thus, our message about the victory over Kerensky * was monitored and *See p.

 relayed by the Austrian wireless telegraph. 
 The Germans, on their part, tried to jam it. 
 We can contact Paris by wireless, and when the peace treaty is drawn up, we shall be able to inform the French people that it can be signed, and that itis up to them to have the armistice concluded within twohours. 
 Let’s see what Clemenceau will have to say then. 
Our Party has never said that it could produce a peace allat once. 
 It said that it would make an immediate offer of peace and would publish the secret treaties. 
 That has been done—the fight for peace is on. 
 It will be an uphill fight. 
International imperialism is mobilising all its forces againstus, but despite its great strength our chances are quite goodin the revolutionary struggle for peace, in which we shallcombine revolutionary fraternisation with the struggle for peace. 
 The bourgeoisie would very much like the imperial-ist governments to combine against us. 
 2 CONCLUDING SPEECH Comrade Chudnovsky said here that he had “taken the liberty” of making some sharp criticisms of the Commis-sars’ actions. 
 There can be no question at all as to whether or not sharp criticism is to be allowed, for it is a revolution-ary’s duty to engage in such criticism, and the People’sCommissars do not claim to be infallible. 
 Comrade Chudnovsky said we could not accept an inde-cent peace, but he failed to cite a single word or fact to showthat this peace was unacceptable. 
 We said: peace can be concluded only by the Council of People’s Commissars. 
 When we began our talks with Dukhonin we were awarethat we were about to negotiate with an enemy, and we can-not procrastinate when dealing with an enemy. 
 We could notforetell the outcome of the talks. 
 But we were fully deter-mined. 
 We had to take a decision on the spot, without leaving the line. 
 We had to act against an insubordinate general there and then. 
 We could not get the Central ExecutiveCommittee together on the line; that was in no sense a vio-lation of the Central Executive Committee’s prerogatives. 
You don’t wait for the outcome in a war, and it was a warwe were fighting against the counter-revolutionary generals, so we turned to the soldiers. 
 We removed Dukhonin but we are not formalists or bureaucrats, and we are well awarethat it was not enough to remove him. 
 He opposed us and weappealed over his head to the army masses. 
 We authorisedthem to enter into armistice negotiations. 
 But we did notconclude an armistice. 
 The soldiers were warned to keep an eye on the counter-revolutionary generals. 
 * I think any *See pp.

 regiment is disciplined enough to maintain the necessary revolutionary order. 
 In the event of betrayal during the soldiers’ armistice negotiations or an attack during fraternisation, it is the soldiers’ duty to shoot the traitorson the spot, without more ado. 
 It is monstrous to allege that we have now weakened our front in the event of the Germans starting an offensive. 
 UntilDukhonin’s exposure and removal, the army was never sure that it was conducting an international policy of peace. 
 It now has this assurance: the only way to fight Dukhoninis to appeal to the sense of discipline and initiative of themasses of soldiers. 
 Peace cannot be concluded only fromabove. 
 Peace must be won from below. 
 We put no trust inthe German generals, but we have faith in the German people. 
 A peace concluded by the commanders-in-chief, without the active participation of the soldiers, would be precarious. 
I do not object to Kamenev’s proposal as a matter of prin-ciple but because it is inadequate and too weak. 
 I have noobjections to a commission but I suggest that we keep anopen mind on its functions; I dislike half-measures and propose that we should be given a free hand in this respect.

 Lenin Written on November 12 (25), 1917 First published in 1933 Published according in Lenin Miscellany XXI to the manuscript 2 SPEECH ON THE AGRARIAN QUESTION NOVEMBER 14 (27) NEWSPAPER REPORT On the instructions of the Bolshevik group, Comrade Lenin delivered a speech setting forth the views of the Bolshevik Party on the agrarian question. 
 He said that the Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries had suffered defeat over the agrarian question, since it hadadvocated the confiscation of the landed estates, but refusedto carry it into effect. 
 Landed proprietorship forms the basis of feudal oppression, and the confiscation of the landed estates is the first step of the revolution in Russia. 
 But the land question cannot besettled independently of the other problems of the revo-lution. 
 A correct view of these problems can be derived froman analysis of the stages through which the revolution haspassed. 
 The first stage was the overthrow of the autocracy and the establishment of the power of the bourgeoisie and the landowners. 
 The interests of the landowners were closelyinterwoven with those of the bourgeoisie and the banks. 
The second stage was the consolidation of the Soviets anda policy of compromise with the bourgeoisie. 
 The mistakeof the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries was that at that time they failed to oppose the policy of compromise on the plea that the masses were not sufficiently enlightened. 
 A party isthe vanguard of a class, and its duty is to lead the massesand not merely to reflect the average political level of themasses. 
 But in order to lead those who vacillate the LeftSocialist-Revolutionary comrades must themselves stop vacillating. 
 Comrades Left Socialist-Revolutionaries! In July there began a period in which the masses of the people started breaking away from the policy of compromise, but to this very day the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries are stretching out a hand to the Avksentyevs, while offering the workers only their little finger. 
 If compromise continues, the revo-lution is doomed. 
 Only if the peasantry supports the workerscan the problems of the revolution be solved. 
 Compromiseis an attempt on the part of the masses of workers, peasantsand soldiers to get their needs satisfied by means of reforms, by concessions on the part of capital, without a socialist revolution. 
 But it is impossible to give the people peace andland without overthrowing the bourgeoisie, without social-ism. 
 It is the duty of the revolution to put an end to com-promise, and to put an end to compromise means taking thepath of socialist revolution. 
 Comrade Lenin went on to defend the instructions to the volost committees 126 and spoke of the necessity of breaking with the leading organs, such as the army committees, theExecutive Committee of the Peasants’ Deputies, etc. 
 Weadopted our law on the volost committees, he said, fromthe peasants. 
 The peasants want land and the prohibition of hired labour; they want implements for the cultivation of the soil. 
 And this cannot be obtained without defeatingcapital. 
 You want land, we said to them, but the land ismortgaged and belongs to Russian and world capital. 
 Youare throwing down a challenge to capital, you are followinga different path from ours; but we are at one with you in that we are marching, and must march, towards the social revolution. 
 As for the Constituent Assembly, the speakersaid that its work will depend on the mood in the country,but he added, trust in the mood, but don’t forget yourrifles. 
 Comrade Lenin went on to deal with the question of the war. 
 When he referred to the removal of Dukhonin and the appointment of Krylenko as Commander-in-Chief, there waslaughter among the audience. 
 It may be funny to you, heretorted, but the soldiers will condemn you for this laughter. 
If there are people here who think it funny that we re-moved a counter-revolutionary general and appointed Krylenko, who is against the general and has gone to con-duct negotiations, 127 we have nothing to say to them. 
 We have nothing in common with those who do not recognise the need to fight the counter-revolutionary generals. 
 Rather than have anything to do with such people we prefer to retire from power, go underground if necessary.

 190, Published according November 28 (15), 1917 to the Pravda text 3 DRAFT RESOLUTION The Peasants’ Congress fully and in every way supports the law (decree) on land of October 26, 1917, approved by the Second All-Russia Congress of Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies and published by the Council of People’sCommissars as the provisional workers’ and peasants’government of the Russian Republic. 
 The Peasants’ Con-gress declares its firm and unshakable resolve to ensure theimplementation of this law, calls upon all peasants to sup-port it unanimously and to carry it out themselves in the localities without delay, and also to elect to all and everyresponsible post and office only people who have proved notin word but in deed their complete devotion to the interestsof the working and exploited peasants, their readiness andability to uphold these interests against any resistance the landowners, capitalists, and their supporters or accomplices may offer. 
 The Peasants’ Congress also expresses its conviction that the full implementation of all the measures constitutingthe law on land is possible only if the workers’ socialistrevolution which began on October 25 is successful, for only the socialist revolution can ensure the transfer of the land to the working peasantry without compensation, the con-fiscation of the landowners’ implements, full protectionof the interests of agricultural wage-workers and the imme-diate commencement of the unconditional abolition of theentire system of capitalist wage-slavery, the proper and planned distribution of the products of both agriculture and industry among the various regions and the populationof the country, control over the banks (without such con-trol the people will not be masters of the land even though private property in land is abolished), all-round state assistance specifically to the working and exploited people, etc. 
 Therefore the Peasants’ Congress, fully supporting the Revolution of October 25, and supporting it precisely as asocialist revolution, declares its unswerving resolve tocarry out, with due gradualness but without the slightest vacillation, measures aimed at the socialist transformation of the Russian Republic. 
 A necessary condition for the victory of the socialist revolution, which alone can secure the lasting triumph andfull implementation of the law on land, is the close alli-ance of the working and exploited peasantry with the work-ing class—the proletariat—in all the advanced countries. 
 In the Russian Republic the entire organisation and admin-istration of the state from top to bottom must henceforthbe based on such an alliance. 
 Rejecting all and everyattempt, direct and indirect, overt and covert, to return toa course that experience has rejected, to the course of con-ciliation with the bourgeoisie and the champions of bour-geois policy, this alliance alone can ensure the victory ofsocialism the world over.

 226, Published according November 15 (28), 1917 to the Izvestia text 4 SPEECH IN CONNECTION WITH THE STATEMENT OF A VIKZHEL SPOKESMAN NOVEMBER 18 (DECEMBER 1) NEWSPAPER REPORT Comrades, the Vikzhel statement is undoubtedly nothing but a misunderstanding. 
 Can you imagine, for one moment, that troops, fully aware of their revolutionary duty and fighting for the people’s interests, would approach FieldHeadquarters and begin smashing up everything and every-one, without making known their demands, without so muchas explaining to the soldiers around H. 
Q. 
 why they hadcome. 
 You must realise, comrades, that that is impossible. 
 A revolutionary army, conscious of what it is about, must make its demands known to those to whom it applies. 
 Whenthe demands were being made, much more was done, carewas taken to make it quite clear that resistance meantresisting the people’s will, that this was not a common buta moral crime against the people’s freedom, interests and highest aspirations. 
 A revolutionary army never fires the first shot, and acts in anger only against invaders andtyrants. 
 Had it been otherwise, the word revolution wouldhave lost its meaning. 
 I feel I must draw your attentionto the fact that while making its unverified charges, Vikzhelannounces its “neutrality”. 
 That is something Vikzhel has no right to do. 
 At a time of revolutionary struggle, when every minute counts, when dissent and neutrality allow theenemy to put in his word, when he will certainly be heard,and when no haste is made to help the people in theirstruggle for their sacred rights, I cannot call such a standneutrality; it is not neutrality; a revolutionary would call it incitement. 
 ( Applause . 
) By taking such a stand you incite the generals to action; when you fail to support us, youoppose the people. 
 To postpone the armistice is just what General Dukhonin wants. 
 By assisting him you are sabotaging the armistice. 
 Think of the grave responsibility that falls upon you, and consider what the people will say. 
 Comrade Lenin went on to say that the telegraph services were being sabotaged in some areas. 
 The government wasleft without information, while its opponents circulatedabsurd rumours. 
 Take the allegation that the Polish bat-talions were opposing the government, although the Poles had repeatedly declared that they had not interfered anddid not intend to interfere in Russian affairs; they have alsoinformed us that they want an armistice. 
 Izvestia No. 
 230, Published according November 19, 1917 to the Izvestia text 5 CONCLUDING SPEECH ON THE AGRARIAN QUESTION NOVEMBER 18 (DECEMBER 1) NEWSPAPER REPORT Comrade Lenin first showed that the accusation of anarch-ism made against the Bolsheviks by the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries had not been proved. 
 In what way did socialists differ from anarchists? The anarchists did not recognise state power whereas the social-ists, the Bolsheviks among them, did recognise it in theperiod of transition between the state of affairs then obtain-ing and the socialism towards which they were progressing. 
 The Bolsheviks favoured a strong authority, but it must be a workers’ and peasants’ authority. 
 All state power is compulsion, but until then it had always been the power of the minority, the power of thelandowner and capitalist employed against the worker andpeasant. 
 He said that the Bolsheviks stood for the state power that would be a firm authority of the majority of the workersand peasants employed against the capitalists and land-owners. 
 Comrade Lenin then went on to show that the Left Social-ist-Revolutionaries’ resolution on the land had called the new government a people’s socialist government, and dwelt on the points that could closely unite the Bolsheviks andLeft Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
 The alliance of the peasants and-workers was a basis for an agreement between the Left Socialist-Revolutionariesand the Bolsheviks. 
 It was an honest coalition, an honest alliance, but it would be an honest coalition at the summit too, between theLeft Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Bolsheviks, if the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries were more definite in stating their conviction that the revolution was a socialist revolu-tion. 
 It was a socialist revolution. 
 The abolition of private property in land, the introduction of workers’ control, thenationalisation of the banks—all these were measures thatwould lead to socialism. 
 They were not socialism, but theywere measures that would lead to socialism by giganticstrides. 
 The Bolsheviks did not promise the workers and peasants milk and honey immediately, but they did say that a close alliance between the workers and the exploitedpeasantry, a firm, unwavering struggle for the power of theSoviets would lead to socialism, and any party that reallywanted to be a people’s party would have to state clearlyand decisively that the revolution was a socialist revolution. 
 And only in the event of the Left Socialist-Revolution-aries stating that clearly and unambiguously would theBolsheviks’ alliance with them grow and become stronger. 
 It had been said that the Bolsheviks were against the socialisation of the land and could not, therefore, come toan agreement with the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
 The Bolsheviks answered that they were indeed against the Socialist-Revolutionaries’ socialisation of the land butthat did not prevent an honest alliance with them. 
 Today or tomorrow the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries would nominate their Minister of Agriculture, and the Bol-sheviks would not vote against a law on the socialisation of the land if he proposed it; they would abstain from vot-ing. 
 In conclusion Comrade Lenin stressed that only an alliance of workers and peasants could acquire land and make peace. 
 Among other things Comrade Lenin was asked what the Bolsheviks would do in the Constituent Assembly if the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries were there in a minority and proposed a bill on the socialisation of the land—would theBolsheviks abstain from voting? Of course not. 
 The Bolshe-viks would vote for the bill but would make the proviso thatthey were voting for it in order to support the peasantsagainst their enemies. 
 Pravda No. 
 195, Published according December 4 (November 21), 1917 to the Pravda text ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE WORKERS AND THE WORKING AND EXPLOITED PEASANTS A LETTER TO PRAVDA Today, Saturday, November 18, in the course of a speech I made at the Peasants’ Congress, I was publicly asked a question to which I forthwith replied. 
 It is essential thatthis question and my reply should immediately be madeknown to all the reading public, for while formally speakingonly in my own name, I was actually speaking in the nameof the whole Bolshevik Party. 
 The matter was the following. 
 Touching on the question of an alliance between the Bolshevik workers and the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries,whom many peasants at present trust, I argued in my speechthat this alliance can be an “honest coalition”, an honest alliance, for there is no radical divergence of interests between the wage-workers and the working and exploited peasants. 
 Socialism is fully able to meet the interests of both. 
 Only socialism can meet their interests. 
 Hence the possibility and necessity for an “honest coalition” betweenthe proletarians and the working and exploited peasantry. 
On the contrary, a “coalition” (alliance) between the working and exploited classes, on the one hand, and the bourgeoisie, on the other, cannot be an “honest coalition” because of the radical divergence of interests between these classes. 
 Imagine, I said, that there is a majority of Bolsheviks and a minority of Left Socialist-Revolutionaries in thegovernment, or even, let us assume, only one Left Socialist-Revolutionary—the Commissar of Agriculture. 
 Could the Bolsheviks practise an honest coalition under such circum-stances? They could; for, while they are irreconcilable in their fight against the counter-revolutionary elements (including the Right Socialist-Revolutionary and the defencist ele-ments), the Bolsheviks would be obliged to abstain from voting on questions which concern purely Socialist-Revolu-tionary points in the land programme approved by theSecond All-Russia Congress of Soviets. 
 Such, for instance,would be the point on equal land tenure and the redistribu-tion of land among the small holders. 
 By abstaining from voting on such a point the Bolsheviks would not be changing their programme in the slightest. 
For, given the victory of socialism (workers’ control overthe factories, to be followed by their expropriation, thenationalisation of the banks, and the creation of a Supreme Economic Council for the regulation of the entire economic life of the country)—given that the workers would be obliged to agree to the transitional measures proposed by the small working and exploited peasants, provided such measureswere not detrimental to the cause of socialism. 
 Even Kautsky, when he was still a Marxist (1899-1909), frequently admit-ted—I said—that the measures of transition to socialism cannot be identical in countries with large-scale and thosewith small-scale farming. 
 We Bolsheviks would be obliged to abstain from voting when such a point was being decided in the Council ofPeople’s Commissars or in the Central Executive Committee, for if the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries (as well as the peasants who support them) agreed to workers’ control, tothe nationalisation of the banks, etc. 
, equal land tenurewould be only one of the measures of transition to full so-cialism. 
 For the proletariat to impose such transitional measures would be absurd; it is obliged, in the interests of the victory of socialism, to yield to the small working and exploited peasants in the choice of these transitional meas-ures, for they could do no harm to the cause of socialism. 
 Thereupon, a Left Socialist-Revolutionary (it was Com-rade Feofilaktov, if I am not mistaken) asked me the fol-lowing question: “How would the Bolsheviks act if in the Constituent Assembly the peasants wanted to pass a law on equal land tenure, while the bourgeoisie were opposed to the peasants and the decision depended on the Bolsheviks?” I replied: under such circumstances, when the cause of socialism would be ensured by the introduction of workers’control, the nationalisation of the banks, etc. 
, the alliancebetween the workers and the working and exploited peasantswould make it obligatory for the party of the proletariatto vote for the peasants and against the bourgeoisie. 
 The Bolsheviks, in my opinion, would be entitled when the vote was being taken to make a declaration of dissent, to placeon record their non-agreement, etc. 
, but to abstain from vot-ing under such circumstances would be to betray theirallies in the fight for socialism because of a difference with them on a partial issue. 
 The Bolsheviks would never betray the peasants in such a situation. 
 Equal land tenure and like measures cannot prejudice socialism if the power is in the hands of a workers’ and peasants’ government, if workers’control has been introduced, the banks nationalised, aworkers’ and peasants’ supreme economic body set up todirect (regulate) the entire economic life of the country, and so forth. 
 Such was my reply.

 194, Published according December 2 (November 19), 1917 to the Pravda text DRAF T DECRE E ON THE RIGH T OF RECAL L128 No elective institution or representative assembly can be regarded as being truly democratic and really represent-ative of the people’s will unless the electors’ right to recall those elected is accepted and exercised. 
 This fundamentalprinciple of true democracy applies to all representativeassemblies without exception, including the ConstituentAssembly. 
 Because the system of proportional representation is more democratic than the majority system, it demands morecomplex measures for the exercise of the right of recall, thatis, the actual subordination of the elected to the people. 
But it would be betraying democracy and abdicating thebasic principles and tasks of the socialist revolution, whichhas begun in Russia, to refuse, on that ground, to practise the right of recall, or to hamper or restrict its exercise in any way. 
 What proportional representation demands is nota curtailment of the right of recall but a mere change of form. 
 Since the system of proportional representation is based on acceptance of the party system and the conduct of elec-tions by organised parties, any major change in the balance of class forces and the relation of classes to parties, especially in the event of splits within major parties, necessarilyproduces the need for a re-election in any electoral districtwhere there is a clear and obvious discrepancy between thewill of the various classes and their strength, on the onehand, and the party composition of those elected, on the other. 
 True democracy makes it imperative that the appoint-ment of re-elections should not depend only on the insti-tution to be re-elected, that is, that the desire on the part of those elected to retain their seats should not work against the exercise of the people’s will to recall its represent-atives. 
 In view of this, the All-Russia Central Executive Com-mittee of the Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’Deputies, resolves: The Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies and the Soviets of Peasants’ Deputies of each electoral district shall have the right to appoint re-elections to all city, Zemstvo and all other representative institutions in general, notexcluding the Constituent Assembly. 
 The Soviets shall alsohave the right to set the date for the re-elections, whichshall be held in the usual manner, in strict conformity withthe principles of the system of proportional representation. 
 Written on November 19 (December 2), 1917 Published in Minutes of the All-Russia Published according Central Executive Committee of Soviets to the manuscript of Workers ’, Soldiers ’, Peasants ’ and Cossacks ’ Deputies , Second Convocation , Moscow, 1918 REPORT ON THE RIGHT OF RECALL AT A MEETING OF THE ALL -RUSSIA CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE NOVEMBER 21 (DECEMBER 4), 1917 The question of re-election is one of actually implementing the democratic principle. 
 It is the accepted practice in all leading countries that only the elected are entitled tospeak in the language of state legislation. 
 But having allowedthe right of summons for the conduct of affairs of state, thebourgeoisie intentionally withheld the right of recall—the right of actual control. 
 In all revolutionary periods in history, a prominent feature in the struggle for constitutional changes has been thefight for the right of recall. 
 Democratic representation exists and is accepted under all parliamentary systems, but this right of representationis curtailed by the fact that the people have the right to cast their votes once in every two years, and while it often turns out that their votes have installed those who helpto oppress them, they are deprived of the democratic rightto put a stop to that by removing these men. 
 But this democratic right of recall has survived in coun-tries with old democratic traditions, for instance, in some cantons of Switzerland and some states of America. 
 Any great revolution clearly confronts the people not only with the use of existing statutes but also with the framingof appropriate new statutes. 
 It is necessary, therefore, inview of the impending convocation of the ConstituentAssembly, to review the new electoral statutes. 
 The Soviets have been created by the working people themselves, by their revolutionary energy and initiative,and that is the only guarantee of their working entirelyto promote the interests of the masses. 
 The truly popular nature of the Soviets is evident in the fact that every peasant sends his representatives to the Soviet and is also entitled to recall them. 
 Various parties in this country have been in power. 
 The last time power passed from one party to another there wasa revolution, a rather stormy revolution, but if we hadhad the right of recall, a simple vote would have sufficed. 
 There is this word freedom. 
 In the old days it meant freedom for the bourgeoisie to manipulate its millions for swindling, freedom to use its forces through such swindling. 
We have done with the bourgeoisie and that kind of freedom. 
The state is an institution for coercion. 
 In the old days,it was the coercion of the whole people by a handful ofmoney-bags. 
 We want to turn the state into an institution enforcing the will of the people. 
 We want to institute coer-cion in the working people’s interests. 
 Failure to grant the right of recall from the Constituent Assembly is failure to elicit the revolutionary will of thepeople, it is usurpation of the people’s rights. 
 We do haveproportional representation, which is indeed the most demo-cratic. 
 Under this system it may be somewhat difficult to introduce the right of recall but the difficulties entailedare purely technical and are fairly easy to overcome. 
 Inany case there is no contradiction between proportionalrepresentation and the right of recall. 
 The people do not cast their votes for individuals but for parties. 
 The party spirit is rather strong in Russia, and as far as the people are concerned each party has a definitepolitical character. 
 That is why any party split must bringconfusion unless the right of recall is provided for. 
 TheSocialist-Revolutionary Party enjoyed great influence. 
 Buta split occurred after the election lists had been put out. 
 The lists cannot be altered, nor can the convocation of the Constituent Assembly be postponed. 
 As a result, the peopleactually voted for a party which had ceased to exist. 
 Thiswas proved by the Left-wing Second Peasant Congress. 
 129 It turned out that the peasants were not misled by indivi-duals but by the party split. 
 This state of things needs to be set right. 
 The direct, consistent and immediate democratic principle, namely, the right of recall, must be intro-duced. 
 One thing we should be wary of is being faced with an unrepresentative election. 
 Given a high level of mass con-sciousness—compare the revolutions of 1905 and 1917— there is nothing to fear from introducing the right ofre-election. 
 The people were told that the Soviet is a plenipotentiary organ: they believed it and acted upon that belief. 
 Theprocess of democratisation must be carried forward and the right of recall introduced. 
 The right of recall should be given to the Soviets, as the best embodiment of the idea of state power, of coercion. 
The transfer of power from one party to another may thentake place peacefully, by mere re-election.

 87, text November 24, 1917 SPEEC H AT THE FIRS T ALL-RUSSI A CONGRESS OF THE NAV Y130 NOVEMBER 22 (DECEMBER 5), 1917 MINUTES On behalf of the Council of People’s Commissars Comrade Lenin greeted the army of sailors, assembled in congress, who have proved themselves to be dedicated fighters for the liberation of the working classes. 
 Lenin went on to analyse the current situation. 
 He said the Kerensky government’s collapse had been inevitable inview of its policy of conciliation, which was not aimed atsatisfying the needs of the broad masses, and was based on the principle of safeguarding all the interests of the bour-geoisie, the oppressor class. 
 He continued: “But alongside the Provisional Government were the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies, which wereproduced by the revolutionary initiative of the insurgentpeople, and which, as time goes on, are rallying ever wider sections of the working masses. 
 In Russia the people have produced and given support to a truly popular government,something no other European revolution has achieved, andthe credit for this accrues to the Soviets alone. 
 The oppressedmasses were confronted with a highly difficult task, thatof building a new state on their own. 
 You can see how much effort the bourgeoisie has thrown into its resistance to us, how attempts are being made to sabotage our activity, andwhat a flood of lies and slander is being poured on us in andout of season. 
 “Accusations of terrorism and violence are being heaped on us, but we take these in our stride. 
 We say we are not anarchists, and are committed to establishing a state. 
 How-ever, the capitalist state has to be smashed and the powerof the capitalists destroyed. 
 It is our task to build a new socialist state. 
 We shall be working tirelessly towards that goal, and we shall be neither intimidated nor deterred by any obstacles. 
 Evidence of this is to be seen in the new Government’s first steps. 
 But the transition to a new systemis an extremely involved process and requires a firm govern-ment to make it easier. 
 Until recently, power has been in thehands of monarchs and the henchmen of the bourgeoisie. 
 Alltheir efforts and policies have served the purpose of coercing the masses. 
 By contrast we say: there must be firm power, coercion is necessary, but we shall direct it against the hand-ful of capitalists, the bourgeois class. 
 We shall always retal-iate with coercion against any attempts—hopeless and madattempts they must be—to resist Soviet power. 
 In everycase, responsibility for this will fall upon those who resist. 
” Comrade Lenin then discussed the establishment of a state machine which, in the interests of the people, should befree from red tape and should leave a lot of room for theoperation of the nation’s creative forces. 
 He went on: “The bourgeoisie and bourgeois intellectual sections of the population are subverting the people’s power in every pos-sible way. 
 The working masses have no one to look to butthemselves. 
 There is no doubt that the great tasks facingthe people are tremendously difficult. 
 But there is need forself-assurance, there is need for all the elements awakenedamong the people and capable of action to join existing organisations and those that will be set up by the working masses. 
 Divided the masses are helpless; united they arestrong. 
 They have gained self-assurance and, refusing to beput out by the bourgeoisie’s badgering, they have set aboutrunning the state on their own. 
 Difficulties may crop up atthe start, due to inadequate training. 
 But the art of practical government, which has been monopolised by the bourgeoisie, must be mastered. 
 In this respect the Navy has shown itselfto be well to the fore, offering a brilliant example of thecreative capacity latent in the working masses. 
” Comrade Lenin then went on to discuss in detail the major questions of the current situation: land, workers’ policy, the nationalities problem, and peace. 
 The Second All-Russia Congress of Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies adopted the Decree on Land, in which the Bolsheviks reproduced the principles stated in the peasant mandates in their entirety. 
 This was a departure from the Social-Democratic programme, for the mandates were drawn up in the spirit of the Socialist-Revolutionaries’programme, but this was proof that the people’s power hadno intention of imposing its will on the people but tried tomeet them half-way. 
 Whatever the solution of the land problem, whatever the programme serving as a basis for the transfer of the land to the peasants, it would in no way hamper the strong alli-ance of the workers and peasants. 
 The important thing wasthat if the peasants had pressed for the abolition of land-ownership for ages, it had to be abolished. 
 The speaker emphasised the tremendous importance of having a strong alliance of workers and peasants, for the question of land was closely bound up with that of industry,and the agrarian revolution had to go hand in hand witha ploughing up of capitalist relations. 
 The onward march of the Russian revolution had shown that the slavish policy of conciliating the landowners and capitalists had been a soap bubble. 
 The will of the majority would be uppermost; it would be carried-out by a workingpeople’s alliance, an honest alliance of workers and peasantson the basis of their common interests. 
 Parties came andwent, but the working people remained, and the speakerurged dedication to the strengthening of this alliance. 
 Let the Navy, he said, dedicate itself to keeping this alliance as the foundation of state affairs; if it remainedsound, nothing could frustrate the cause of transition tosocialism. 
 Turning to the nationalities question, Lenin said, we should take note of Russia’s highly patchy national composi-tion, with the Russians making up only about 40 per cent, and the majority consisting of other nationalities. 
 Nationaloppression under the tsars, unmatched in savagery andabsurdity, turned the rightless nationalities into great reser-voirs of fierce hatred for the monarchs. 
 It was not surprisingthat all Russians had been included in their hatred for those who went to the extent of prohibiting the use of the mother tongue, and doomed masses of people to illiteracy. 
 It wasassumed that the privileged Russians would try to retain the advantages which had been so assiduously preserved for them by Nicholas II and Kerensky. 
 “We are told that Russia will disintegrate and split up into separate republics but we have no reason to fear this. 
We have nothing to fear, whatever the number of independ-ent republics. 
 The important thing for us is not where thestate border runs, but whether or not the working peopleof all nations remain allied in their struggle against the bourgeoisie, irrespective of nationality. 
 ( Stormy applause . 
) “If the Finnish bourgeoisie are buying arms from the Germans in order to use them against their workers, we offerthe latter an alliance with the Russian working people. 
 Letthe bourgeoisie start their filthy petty squabbles and theirtrading over frontiers, the workers of all countries and nationalities will not fall out over that sort of thing. 
 ( Stormy applause. 
 ) “We are now ‘conquering’ Finland—this is using a nasty word—but not the way the robber barons of internationalcapitalism conquered it. 
 We are winning Finland over bygiving her complete freedom to live in alliance with us or with others, guaranteeing full support for the working people of all nationalities against the bourgeoisie of allcountries. 
 It is not an alliance based on treaties, but on thesolidarity of the exploited against the exploiters. 
 “We now see a national movement in the Ukraine and we say that we stand unconditionally for the Ukrainian people’s complete and unlimited freedom. 
 We have to wipe out that old bloodstained and dirty past when the Russiaof the capitalist oppressors acted as the executioner of otherpeoples. 
 We are determined to wipe out that past, and leaveno trace of it. 
 ( Stormy applause . 
) “We are going to tell the Ukrainians that as Ukrainians they can go ahead and arrange their life as they see fit. 
 But we are going to stretch out a fraternal hand to theUkrainian workers and tell them that together with them weare going to fight against their bourgeoisie and ours. 
 Onlya socialist alliance of the working people of all countriescan remove all ground for national persecution and strife. 
 ( Stormy applause . 
) “I shall now touch on the question of war. 
 We have started a resolute struggle against the war brought on by the clash of robbers over their spoils. 
 Until now all parties have spoken of this struggle but have not gone beyond words and hypocrisy. 
 Now the struggle for peace is on. 
 It is a difficult struggle. 
 It is highly naïve to think that peace can be easilyattained, and that the bourgeoisie will hand it to us on Qplatter as soon as we mention it. 
 Those who ascribed thisview to the Bolsheviks were cheating. 
 The capitalists areembroiled in a life and death struggle over the share-out of the booty. 
 One thing is clear: to kill war is to defeat capital, and Soviet power has started the struggle to thatend. 
 We have published and will continue to publish secrettreaties. 
 We are not going to be deterred in this by anyone’sanger or slander. 
 The bourgeois gentlemen are beside them-selves because the people see why they have been driven to the slaughter. 
 They threaten Russia with the prospect of another war, in which she will find herself isolated. 
 But weare not going to be deterred by the bourgeoisie’s fierce hatredfor us and for our peace movement. 
 It will be quite futilefor them to try to incite the peoples against each other inthis fourth year of the war. 
 They are sure to fail. 
 It is not only in this country, but in all the belligerent countries that the struggle against the imperialist government at homeis welling up. 
 There has been an open mutiny in the navyeven in Germany, which the imperialists tried for decades toturn into an armed camp with the entire governmentmachine geared to stamping out the slightest sign of popular discontent. 
 To understand the significance of this mutiny, one has to be aware that police reprisals in Germany areunparalleled. 
 But revolution is not made to order; it resultsfrom an outburst of mass indignation. 
 Whereas it was quiteeasy to drive out a band of nitwits, like Romanov and Ras-putin, 131 it is immensely more difficult to fight against the organised and strong clique of German imperialists, both crowned and uncrowned. 
 But we can and have to work handin hand with the revolutionary class of working people inall countries. 
 That is the path the Soviet Government hastaken by making public the secret treaties and showing thatthe rulers of all countries are brigands. 
 That is not propa-ganda by word but by deed. 
” ( Stormy applause . 
) In conclusion the speaker dealt with the question of the peace talks and said: “When the Germans gave an evasive reply to our demand not to transfer any troops to the Western and Italian fronts, we broke off the talks and shall resume them in a little while. 
 And when we do tell this to the world, no Germanworker will remain ignorant of the fact that the peace talkshad been broken off through no fault of ours. 
 In the hypothet-ical case of the German working class siding with theirgovernment of imperialist plunderers and confronting us with the need to continue the war, the Russian people—who have always shed blood without a murmur, and have donethe will of an oppressive government when quite ignorantof its aims and purposes—will undoubtedly throw theirweight into the struggle with so much more courage andvigour when it came to fighting for socialism and freedom threatened with the bayonets of the world bourgeoisie. 
 But we put our trust in the international solidarity of the workingmasses, who will surmount every obstacle and barrier in thestruggle for socialism.

 239, November 29, 1917 THE TASKS OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY IN PETROGRAD It takes knowledge to participate in the revolution with intelligence, purpose and success. 
 Because tsarism had played havoc with public education over a period of many years, the library service in Petro-grad is in a very bad state. 
 The following changes, based on principles long prac-tised in the free countries of the West, especially Switzer-land and the United States, must be made immediately and unconditionally: (1) The public library (the former Imperial Library) must immediately start an exchange of books with all public and state libraries in Petrograd and the provinces andwith foreign libraries (in Finland, Sweden, etc. 
). 
 (2) The forwarding of books from one library to another must be made post-free by law. 
 (3) The library’s reading-room must be open, as is the practice with private libraries and reading-rooms for the rich in civilised countries, from 8. 
00 a. 
m. 
 to 11. 
00 p. 
m. 
 daily, not excluding Sun-days and holidays. 
 (4) The required personnel must be immediately trans-ferred to the Public Library from the various offices ofthe Ministry of Education (with more women, in view ofthe military demand for men), where nine-tenths of the staffare engaged not merely in useless, but in downright harmfulwork. 
 Written in November 1917 First published in 1933 Published according in Lenin Miscellany XXI to the manuscript MEETING OF THE ALL -RUSSIA CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE DECEMBER 1 (14), 1917 1 SPEECH ON THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY135 Considered apart from the circumstances of the class war, which has developed into civil war, we so far do not know of a more perfect institution for determining the will of the people than the Constituent Assembly. 
 But we mustnot indulge in fancies. 
 The Constituent Assembly will haveto function under civil war conditions; the Kaledinite bour-geois elements have started a civil war. 
 After attempting to drag out the insurrection in Moscow, after the unsuccessful attempt on the part of Kerensky to bring troops against Petrograd, after the fruitless attemptto organise the counter-revolutionary high-ranking officersof the army, these elements are now endeavouring to organ-ise an uprising on the Don. 
 The attempt is hopeless, sincethe working Cossacks are opposed to the Kaledinites. 
 Replying to the charge of persecuting the Cadet Party, Comrade Lenin said: “The class struggle must not be regard-ed separately from one’s political opponents. 
 When it issaid that the Cadet Party is not a strong group, it is nottrue. 
 The Cadet Central Committee is the political generalstaff of the bourgeois class. 
 The Cadets have absorbed all propertied classes; they have been joined by elements that stood to the right of the Cadets. 
 They all support the CadetParty. 
 “We are being called upon to convene the Constituent Assembly in the form in which it was first planned. 
 Underno circumstances. 
 It was planned against the interests of the people. 
 We made the revolution so as to have guarantees that the Constituent Assembly would not be used against thepeople, and in order that the guarantees would be in the hands of the government. 
 Our decree states clearly and unambiguously when the Constituent Assembly will be con-vened. 
136 It contains an exact answer to that question. 
 Do not try any thought-reading—we are concealing nothing. 
 Wesaid that we shall convene the Constituent Assembly as soonas four hundred deputies have arrived. 
 We are not to blamethat the elections took place later than appointed. 
 In certainlocalities the Soviets themselves appointed later election dates. 
 Since the elections were held on various dates, it was necessary to determine how many deputies are requiredin order to open the Constituent Assembly. 
 An attempt toconvene it irrespective of the number of deputies presenthas been made, taking advantage of the fact that thenumber is not indicated in the law. 
 What would be the position of a government that permitted such a thing? The Soviet government did the right thing in decreeing thenumber of deputies necessary for the Constituent Assembly tobe deemed properly constituted. 
 That is what the Soviet gov-ernment did. 
 Those who are not in agreement should criticisethe decree. 
 But if we hear insinuations and guesses instead of criticism, we brush them aside. 
 “When a revolutionary class is fighting the propertied classes that offer resistance, the resistance must be crushed. 
And we shall crush the resistance of the propertied classes,using the same means as they used to crush the proletariat—no other means have been invented. 
 “You said the bourgeoisie must be isolated. 
 But the Cadets are actually starting civil war under cover of a formallydemocratic demand, the demand for a Constituent Assembly. 
They say they want to sit in the Constituent Assembly andorganise civil war at the same time. 
 And you reply to thatby talk about isolation. 
 “We are not merely persecuting non-observers of formali-ties, we are levelling direct political accusations againsta political party. 
 The French revolutionaries acted in thisway. 
 This is our reply to those peasants who elected withoutrealising whom they were electing. 
 Let the people know thatthe Constituent Assembly is being summoned in a way some-what different from what Kerensky intended. 
 We have introduced the right of recall, and the Constituent Assemblywill not be quite the thing the bourgeoisie planned. 
 Although only a few days remain before the Constituent Assembly is summoned, the bourgeoisie are organising civil war, inten-sifying sabotage and undermining the armistice. 
 We shall not let ourselves be deceived by formal slogans. 
 The bourgeoi-sie would like to sit in the Constituent Assembly and at thesame time organise civil war. 
 Let them examine the substanceof our accusation against the Cadet Party; let them provethat the Cadet Party is not the general staff of the civil war, an obviously hopeless war that is drenching the country in blood. 
 Comrade Steinberg has not attempted to prove that. 
He has forgotten all that has been revealed about the con-tacts between the Cadets and Kornilov; it was not we, butChernov, our political opponent, who revealed those con-tacts. 
 It is proposed that we catch the little men, but we shall not hunt for particular individuals in order to hide our political accusation against the general staff of a whole class. 
” Comrade Lenin then dealt with the remark that the Bol-sheviks had also been proclaimed enemies of the people. 
 “They threatened to proclaim us enemies of the people,” he said, “but they did not do so. 
 They did not dare. 
 We said to them at that time, ‘Well, try it, if you can; try to tell the people that the Bolshevik Party, as a party, as a trend,is the enemy of the people’. 
 They did not dare; they hunteddown individuals, they resorted to slander. 
 We said, ‘Youcannot proclaim us enemies of the people; you have not asingle objection in principle to bring against the Bolshe-viks; all you can do is to spread calumnies. 
’ Our accusation against the Cadet Party puts an end to petty manoeuvres inthe political struggle. 
 We shall tell the people the truth. 
We shall tell the people that their interests are superiorto the interests of a democratic institution. 
 We must notreturn to the old prejudices, which subordinate the inter-ests of the people to formal democracy. 
 The Cadets cry, All Power to the Constituent Assembly. 
 But what they meanin fact is, All Power to Kaledin. 
 The people must be toldthat, and the people will approve our action.

 When I arrived here I heard part of the speech of the last speaker, who, turning to me, told you that I wanted todisperse you at the point of the bayonet. 
 Comrades, Russiahas grown too mature to suffer anyone to rule her. 
 You know that from the moment the army turned their weapons to win freedom, from the moment it became possible for thepeasant in uniform to meet and arrange matters with thepeasant not in uniform, from that moment there has been noforce that can break the will of the people, the will of thepeasants and workers. 
 Comrades, I want to tell you how we understand the Revolution of October 25. 
 Comrades, it has been said herethat a new wave of revolution may sweep the Soviets away. 
I say “No”. 
 I am firmly convinced that the Soviets will neverperish; the Revolution of October 25 proved that. 
 TheSoviets will never perish, for they were formed as far back as the first revolution of 1905; they were formed after the February revolution, and they were not formed on theinitiative of any individual, but from below, by the will of the masses. 
 There can be no restrictions and no red tape, for they have been formed by the will of the people, and the people are free to recall their representatives at any moment. 
 The Soviets are superior to any parliament, they are superiorto any constituent assembly. 
 ( Commotion and cries : That’s a lie!) The Party of the Bolsheviks has always declared thatthe supreme body is the Soviets. 
 That cannot be called a lie,because the revolutions in Europe that overthrew mon-archies formed bourgeois republics with the help of constit-uent assemblies. 
 There has never before been a revolutionsuch as ours anywhere in the world. 
 It is said that the Revo-lution of October 25 created only “a Bolshevik government”. 
I might say that there are not only Bolsheviks in the Councilof People’s Commissars. 
 Those of you who remember the First Congress of Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies will know that the Bolsheviks were then in the minority;but, having learned the meaning of the policy of compromisefrom experience, the Second Congress of Workers’ and Sol-diers’ Deputies, which represented the people, gave a major-ity to the Bolshevik Party. 
 When they tell me that bayonets may be directed against the Soviets and shout it from the columns of the hostile press, I simply laugh. 
 Thebayonets are in the hands of the workers, the soldiers and thepeasants, and as long as they are they will never bedirected against the Soviets. 
 Let the counter-revolutionturn its bayonets on the Soviets, it will not scare them. 
 Passing to the question of the Constituent Assembly, I must say that the Constituent Assembly can help only ifthe people themselves are free to develop and build up anew life. 
 And I ask you: Is that the case? I am telling you what you all know: “The sabbath was made for man and not man for the sabbath”. 
 Comrades, you know how the Constituent Assembly was elected. 
 It waselected by one of the most progressive election methods,for it is not individuals who were elected, but representativesof parties. 
 This is a step forward, for revolutions are made byparties and not by individuals. 
 When the elections to the Constituent Assembly took place there was only one party of Socialist-Revolutionaries, the party which has the majorityin the Constituent Assembly. 
 But that is not the case now. 
 /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR You will perhaps say that the Bolsheviks also brought that about. 
 No, comrades, that is a universal law. 
 Always and everywhere, the people are slowly and painfully dividing into two camps—that of the dispossessed and downtrod-den, of those who are fighting for a brighter future for allworking people, and that of those who in one way or anothersupport the landowners and capitalists. 
 When the electionstook place the people did not elect those who expressed their will and their desires. 
 You say that we have declared the whole Cadet Party enemies of the people. 
 Yes, we have. 
And thereby we expressed the will of the Second Congressof Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies. 
 And now thatwe are on the threshold of peace and the cessation of theterrible slaughter that has lasted three years, we are con-vinced that this is the demand of all the working people in all countries. 
 The overthrow of imperialism in Europe isproceeding slowly and painfully, and imperialists in allcountries will now see that the people are strong, and intheir strength will overthrow all who stand in their way. 
We shall not be deterred when people who are organising revolt against the workers and peasants, against the Soviets, with the other hand show us their credentials to the Constit-uent Assembly. 
 In July we were told that we should beproclaimed enemies of the people. 
 And we answered, “Tryit”. 
 If the bourgeois gentlemen and their followers hadonly tried to say that to the people openly! But they did not; they resorted to insinuation, slander and mud-slinging. 
 When the bourgeoisie began the civil war (we witnessedit), they incited the officer cadets to revolt. 
 And we, thevictors, were merciful to them, the vanquished. 
 More thanthat, we even spared their military honour. 
 And now, whenthe Constituent Assembly is being convened, we say: We shall open the Constituent Assembly as soon as four hundred of its members arrive. 
 We see that the conspiracy of theCadets is continuing, we see that they are organising arevolt against the Soviets in the interests of the money-bags,of greed and riches, and we publicly proclaim them enemiesof the people. 
 At a time when the terms of peace will shortly be known, when we are about to have an armistice, when the members of the land committees will be immune from arrest,when the landed estates are being confiscated, and when control will be established over the factories—at such a time they are conspiring against us, against the Soviets. 
 We there-fore declare that the party of the Cadets is a party of the bourgeoisie, that they are enemies of the people, and thatwe shall fight them.

 244, Published according December 6, 1917 to a typewritten copy of the Minutes MANIFESTO TO THE UKRAINIAN PEOPLE WITH AN ULTIMATUM TO THE UKRAINIAN RADA138 Proceeding from the interests of the unity and fraternal alliance of factory workers and the working and exploited masses in the struggle for socialism, and also from therecognition of these principles by numerous decisions of theorgans of revolutionary democracy, the Soviets, and espe-cially the Second All-Russia Congress of Soviets, the Coun-cil of People’s Commissars—the Socialist government of Russia—reaffirms that the right to self-determination belongs to all nations oppressed by tsarism and the GreatRussian bourgeoisie, up to and including the right of thesenations to secede from Russia. 
 Accordingly we, the Council of People’s Commissars, recognise the People’s Ukrainian Republic, and its right to secede from Russia or enter into a treaty with the Russian Republic on federal or similar relations between them. 
 We, the Council of People’s Commissars, recognise at once, unconditionally and without reservations everythingthat pertains to the Ukrainian people’s national rightsand national independence. 
 We have not taken a single step, in the sense of restrict-ing the Finnish people’s national rights or national inde-pendence, against the bourgeois Finnish Republic, whichstill remains bourgeois, nor shall we take any steps restrict-ing the national independence of any nation which hadbeen—or desires to be—a part of the Russian Republic. 
 We accuse the Rada of conducting, behind a screen of national phrases, a double-dealing bourgeois policy, whichhas long been expressed in the Rada’s non-recognition of the Soviets and of Soviet power in the Ukraine (incidentally, the Rada has refused to convoke a territorial congress of the Ukrainian Soviets immediately, as the Soviets of the Ukraine had demanded). 
 This ambiguous policy, which has madeit impossible for us to recognise the Rada as a plenipotentiaryrepresentative of the working and exploited masses of theUkrainian Republic, has lately led the Rada to steps whichpreclude all possibility of agreement. 
 These, firstly, were steps to disorganise the front. 
 The Rada has issued unilateral orders moving Ukrainian units and withdrawing them from the front, thereby breakingup the common united front before any demarcation, which can be carried out only through a formal agreement betweenthe governments of the two republics. 
 Secondly, the Rada has started to disarm the Soviet troops stationed in the Ukraine. 
 Thirdly, the Rada has been extending support to the Cadet-Kaledin plot and revolt against Soviet power. 
 On thepatently false plea of “the Don and the Kuban” having auton-omous rights, a plea that serves to cover up Kaledin’s counter-revolutionary moves, which clash with the inter-ests and demands of the vast majority of the working Cos-sacks, the Rada has allowed its territory to be crossed bytroops on their way to Kaledin, but has refused transit to any anti-Kaledin troops. 
 Even if the Rada had received full formal recognition as the uncontested organ of supreme state power of an independ-ent bourgeois Ukrainian republic, we would have beenforced to declare war on it without any hesitation, becauseof its attitude of unexampled betrayal of the revolutionand support of the Cadets and the Kaledinites—the bitterestenemies of the national independence of the peoples of Rus-sia, the enemies of Soviet power and of the working and exploited masses. 
 At the present time, in view of the circumstances set forth above, the Council of People’s Commissars, with the fullcognisance of the peoples of the Ukrainian and RussianRepublics, asks the Rada 139 to answer the following ques-tions: 1. 
 Will the Rada undertake to give up its attempts to disorganise the common front? 2. 
 Will the Rada undertake to refuse transit to any army units on their way to the Don, the Urals or elsewhere, unless it has the sanction of the Commander-in-Chief? 3. 
 Will the Rada undertake to assist the revolutionary troops in their struggle against the counter-revolutionaryCadet-Kaledin revolt? 4. 
 Will the Rada undertake to stop attempts to disarm the Soviet regiments and the workers’ Red Guard in the Ukraine and immediately return arms to those who had been deprived of them? In the event no satisfactory answer is received to these questions within 48 hours, the Council of People’s Commis-sars will deem the Rada to be in a state of open war withSoviet power in Russia and the Ukraine.

 244 REPORT ON THE ECONOMIC CONDITION OF PETROGRAD WORKERS AND THE TASKS OF THE WORKING CLASS, DELIVERED AT A MEETING OF THE WORKERS ’ SECTION OF THE PETROGRAD SOVIET OF WORKERS ’ AND SOLDIERS ’ DEPUTIES DECEMBER 4 (17), 1917 NEWSPAPER REPORT The Revolution of October 25 had shown the exceptional political maturity of the proletariat and its ability to stand firm in opposition to the bourgeoisie, said the speaker. 
 Thecomplete victory of socialism, however, would require atremendous organisational effort filled with the knowledgethat the proletariat must become the ruling class. 
 The proletariat was faced with the tasks of transforming the state system on socialist lines, for no matter how easy it would be to cite arguments in favour of a middle coursesuch a course would be insignificant, the country’s economicsituation having reached a state that would rule out anymiddle course. 
 There was no place left for half-measuresin the gigantic struggle against imperialism and capitalism. 
 The point at issue was—win or lose. 
 The workers should and did understand this; this was obvious because they had rejected half-way, compromisedecisions. 
 The more profound the revolution, the greater thenumber of active workers required to accomplish the replace-ment of capitalism by a socialist machinery. 
 Even if there were no sabotage, the forces of the petty bourgeoisie would be inadequate. 
 The task was one that could be accomplishedonly by drawing on the masses, only by the independentactivity of the masses. 
 The proletariat, therefore, shouldnot think of improving its position at the moment, butshould think of becoming the ruling class. 
 It could not be expected that the rural proletariat would be clearly and firmly conscious of its own interests. 
 Only the working classcould be, and every proletarian, conscious of the great pros-pects, should feel himself to be a leader and carry the masses with him. 
 The proletariat should become the ruling class in the sense of being the leader of all who work; it should be the rulingclass politically. 
 The illusion that only the bourgeoisie could run the state must be fought against. 
 The proletariat must take the ruleof the state upon itself. 
 The capitalists were doing everything they could to compli-cate the tasks of the working class. 
 And all working-classorganisations—trade unions, factory committees andothers—would have to conduct a determined struggle in theeconomic sphere. 
 The bourgeoisie was spoiling everything,sabotaging everything, in order to wreck the working-class revolution. 
 And the tasks of organising production devolved entirely on the working class. 
 They should do away, onceand for all, with the illusion that state affairs or the man-agement of banks and factories were beyond the power of theworkers. 
 All this could be solved only by tremendous day-to-day organisational work. 
 It was essential to organise the exchange of products and introduce regular accounting and control—these weretasks for the working class, and the knowledge necessaryfor their accomplishment had been provided by factory life. 
 Every factory committee should concern itself not only with the affairs of its own factory, but should also be an organisation nucleus helping arrange the life of the state as a whole. 
 It was easy to issue a decree on the abolition of private property, but it must and could be implemented only by theworkers themselves. 
 Let there be mistakes—they would bethe mistakes of a new class creating a new way of life. 
 There was not and could not be a definite plan for the organisation of economic life. 
 Nobody could provide one. 
 But it could be done from below, by the masses, through their experience. 
 Instructionswould, of course, be given and ways would be indicated,but it was necessary to begin simultaneously from above and from below. 
 The Soviets would have to become bodies regulating all production in Russia, but in order that they should not become staff headquarters without troops, work in the lower echelons was needed.... 
 * The working-class masses must set about the organisation of control and production on a country-wide scale. 
 Not theorganisation of individuals, but the organisation of all theworking people, would be a guarantee of success; if theyachieved that, if they organised economic life, everythingopposing them would disappear of its own accord.

 ON THE OPENING OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY In view of the delay in the elections to the Constituent Assembly, mainly due to the fault of the former All-Russia Electoral Commission, and in view of the formation bycounter-revolutionary groups of a special Constituent As-sembly Commission in opposition to the Commissariat setup by Soviet power, rumours have been circulated that theConstituent Assembly, as at present constituted, would not be convened at all. 
 The Council of People’s Commissars deems it necessary to declare that these are absolutely falserumours, deliberately and maliciously spread by the enemiesof the Soviets of Peasants’, Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies. 
According to the decree of the Council of People’s Commis-sars, which has been approved by the Central Executive Committee of the Soviets, the Constituent Assembly is to meet as soon as one-half of its members, namely 400 deputies,are duly registered at the Taurida Palace chancellory.

 Peasant comrades, we constitute the overwhelming major-ity of the population of our c ountry, the vast mass of the working and exploited people. 
 We are the vast mass thatchampions the lawful and just demands of the working people—first and foremost the demand for land—we fight all forms of oppression and exploitation by the landowners andcapitalists. 
 Peasant comrades, we are the main body of our army, those who have suffered most the inhuman torments of morethan three years of the war instigated by kings and capital-ists; it has also fallen to our lot to undertake the difficult but thankful and honourable role of vanguard fighters—together with the workers—for freedom, land and peace,and for the complete emancipation of the working peoplefrom all oppression and exploitation. 
 Peasant comrades, consider our appeal, this manifesto issued by peasant deputies to the peasants of all nationa-lities in Russia. 
 Make known our appeal in every village andin every cottage; discuss it at every meeting and village assembly and in every peasant body without exception, and make your own firm and unshakable decisions in the locali-ties. 
 For it is chiefly on your decisions, on the decisions of the majority of the people, the decisions of the peasants them-selves, that the fate of our native land depends. 
 The fateful hour is approaching. 
 The last fight is at hand. 
 The whole country and all the nations of our republic aredivided into two great camps. 
 One is the camp of the landowners and capitalists, the rich and their servitors, the state dignitaries and theirfriends, the bosses of the nation and the champions of thewar. 
 The other is the camp of the factory workers and the work-ing and exploited peasants, the poor people and their friends, the rank-and-file soldiers and the champions of peace, the advocates of a heroic, decisive and bold revolu-tionary struggle for peace, a struggle in which no mercywill be shown to the oppressors of the people. 
 The struggle between these two camps has in some parts of the country already assumed the acute form of open and direct civil war, a war of the Soviet armies against a small handful of those who are relying on the power of wealthand who desire to overthrow Soviet power, the power andgovernment of the Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peas-ants’ Deputies. 
 Peasant comrades, on your weighty, firm and unshakable word much now depends; on it depends the cessation of this civil war; on it depends the possibility in Russia of peaceful-ly transferring all the land to the working people withoutcompensation; on it depends the possibility of a peacefultransition to socialism. 
 Peasant comrades, rise to a man;give voice to your demands; draw up your mandates in every village. 
 You can make yourselves heard; you can make everyone listen to you! Peasant comrades, you must in the first place roundly condemn those deputies to the Second All-Russia Peasants’Congress who split away from the Congress. 
 Condemn the splitters. 
 Condemn those who are smashing the unity of the peasants, the unity of the working people, the unity of the peasants and workers. 
 These splitters, these breakersof peasant unity, these deserters to the camp of the rich, to the camp of the landowners and capitalists have committed an outrageous crime. 
 These people call themselves Socialist-Revolutionaries of the Right wing and the Centre, followers of Avksentyev and Chernov. 
 They have betrayed the wholedoctrine and programme of the Socialist-Revolutionaries;they have deserted to the enemies of socialism, to the suppres-sors of the revolution. 
 They have broken with the faithfulcustodians of the doctrine, programme and demands of the Socialist-Revolutionaries, the party of the internationalist Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, who have remained loyalto the interests of the working peasantry. 
 These followersof Avksentyev and Chernov have quit the Second All-RussiaPeasants’ Congress and refused to submit to the decisionof the majority of the peasants in order to carry out the will of the wealthy and the capitalists against the peasants, in order to hinder the cause of peace, in order to prevent theimmediate transfer of all the land, without compensation,to the working people, and in order to protect the policy ofAvksentyev, Chernov, Maslov and their like, a policy fatalto the peasants. 
 Condemn these traitors to the peasant cause. 
 By condemn-ing them, you will save many of the weak and wavering,and you will save Russia from insane attempts at civil war—insane, because, apart from shedding rivers of blood invain, they will change nothing; nothing in the world canshatter the unanimous decision of the workers, soldiers and peasants, the decision of the Second All-Russia Congress of Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies and of the Sec-ond All-Russia Congress of Peasants’ Deputies. 
 Condemn these traitors to the peasant cause. 
 Let every village express its confidence in the decisions of the twocongresses, the Congress of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Soviets and the Congress of Peasants’ Soviets. 
 Let every village recall from the Constituent Assembly those deputies from the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, or from the Peasants’Soviets and institutions, who have not loudly proclaimed,and proved in practice, their wholehearted acceptance ofthese decisions. 
 Peasant comrades, you all know that opponents of the decisions of the Second All-Russia Congress of Soviets ofWorkers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies and of the Second All-Russia Congress of Peasants’ Deputies could be elected and did get elected to the Constituent Assembly as peasant representatives, only by fraud . 
 These people, who often call themselves Socialist-Revolutionaries, actually dupedthe peasants, who did not yet know the truth about thepolicy of Avksentyev, Chernov and Maslov, a policy ofmaking concessions to the landowners, compromising withthe capitalists, and arresting members of the local peasants’ land committees. 
 These Avksentyevs, Maslovs and Cher-novs deceived the peasants, since the general lists of theSocialist-Revolutionary Party were compiled before October17, whereas the truth was revealed to the whole of Russiaonly after October 17. 
 The truth was revealed to the whole of Russia by the Second All-Russia Congress of Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies, held on October 25 and 26, 1917. 
 Thetruth was further revealed by Soviet power, the SovietGovernment, which was the first to publish the shamefulsecret treaties, the first to start a really revolutionary strug-gle for peace, the first to show in practice what that struggle should be; and it has already achieved its first success: an armistice on one of the fronts. 
 The truth was revealed by the Soviet Government when it passed the Decree on Land, thereby unconditionally sid-ing with the peasants and eliminating all possibility ofoutside interference in the full power of the peasants in the localities. 
 The truth was revealed by the Second All-Russia Peas-ants’ Congress, which was the first to expose to the peasants,in a special and detailed resolution, the shameful role playedby the Avksentyev-Chernov Executive Committee. 
 Thecongress will close on December 8, having begun (?) 141 o n November 30, 1917. 
 You thus see, peasant comrades, that when the lists were drawn up on October 17, and during the elections to theConstituent Assembly on November 12, the peasants still could not have known the truth about land and peace, and still could not distinguish their friends from their enemies, from the wolves in sheep’s clothing. 
 You see that those Socialist-Revolutionaries who oppose the decisions of theSecond All-Russia Congress of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies and of the Second All-Russia Congress of Peasants’ Deputies can speak in the name of the peasants only by fraud. 
 Peasant comrades, do not allow blood to be shed because of this fraud ! Raise your voices in determined protest against those who quitted the Second All-Russia Congress ofPeasants’ Deputies. 
 Draw up your mandates in every guber-nia, in every uyezd, in every volost and in every village;protest against those who withdrew from the congress; publish the names of the peasant deputies to the Constituent Assembly from your localities who have not accepted the decisions of these congresses, and demand the resignation of these deputies from the Constituent Assembly; for it isonly by deceiving the people that they can pretend to havebeen elected by them. 
 Peasant comrades, the Constituent Assembly must express the will of the people. 
 Those who quitted the Second All-Russia Congress of Peasants’ Deputies, who thwarted itswill, who caused a split among the peasants and who desertedthe peasants for the rich, are not the representatives ofthe people. 
 They are traitors, and there is no place for them in the Constituent Assembly. 
 They do not bring peace or land to the working people, they bring the people the sense-less and criminal rebellion of the rich against Soviet power. 
The people will not tolerate fraud. 
 The people will notallow their will to be thwarted. 
 The people will not handSoviet power over to the rich. 
 The people will not allow the rich to ruin the cause of peace they uphold, or disrupt the transfer of the land to the working people, immediately, without exception and without compensation. 
 The country is faced with only this alternative:Either a civil war of the Kaledinites, the Cadets, the Kornilovites (and their concealed allies, the followers of Avksentyev, Chernov and Maslov) against Soviet power, a bloody war, a hopeless war for its initiators, a war that willnot deprive the Soviets of power but will only result ingreater bitterness, greater sacrifice, greater bloodshed,greater delay in carrying through the great socialist reforms,and greater famine in the gubernias where there is no grain, or— the honest recognition of the obvious truth that the oppo-nents of the decisions of the Second All-Russia Congress of Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies and of the Sec-ond All-Russia Congress of Peasants’ Deputies could have got the peasants to elect them to the Constituent Assembly only by fraud, and that there must be new elections for such deputies. 
 There is no third path. 
 Either the bloody exterminationto the rich, the followers of Avksentyev, Chernov and Mas-lov, or their consent to new elections of peasants’ deputies of the Constituent Assembly as soon as the opponents of the decisions of the two Soviet congresses, the Second All-Russia Congress of Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Depu-ties and the Second All-Russia Congress of Soviets of Peas-ants’ Deputies, come out in the name of the peasants inthe Constituent Assembly. 
 It is for you to say, peasant comrades! It is for you to decide!The resolute word of all peasants, the peasant mandates from all the localities , can bring peace to the whole coun-try, to all the nationalities of Russia, can stop the civil war,can guarantee a true and genuine and not a sham Consti-tuent Assembly, can expedite and facilitate the termination of the war by a just peace and accelerate the transfer of theland to the working people, can strengthen the alliancebetween the peasants and the workers and hasten the triumphof socialism. 
 It is for you to decide, peasant comrades! Long live the transfer of the land to the working people! Long live peace! Long live socialism!

 DZERZHINSKY WIT H A DRAF T OF A DECRE E ON FIGHTING COUNTE R-REVOLUTIONARIE S AND SABOTEU RS142 To Comrade Dzerzhinsky, Further to your report today on measures for fighting saboteurs and counter-revolutionaries, would it not be possible to submit a decree like the fol-lowing ? On Fighting Counter-Revolutionaries and Saboteurs The bourgeoisie, the landowners and all the rich classes are making desperate efforts to undermine the revolution, the aim of which is to safeguard the interests of the workers,the working and exploited masses. 
 The bourgeoisie are prepared to commit the most heinous crimes; they are bribing the outcast and degraded elementsof society and plying them with drink to use them in riots. 
The supporters of the bourgeoisie, particularly among thehigher clerical staff, bank officials, and so on, are sabotagingtheir work, and are organising strikes to thwart the govern-ment’s measures for the realisation of socialist reforms. 
 They have even gone so far as to sabotage food distribution,thereby menacing millions of people with famine. 
 Urgent measures are necessary to fight the counter-revo-lutionaries and saboteurs. 
 In virtue of this, the Council ofPeople’s Commissars decrees: (1) Persons belonging to the wealthy classes (i. 
e. 
, with incomes of 500 rubles or more per month, and owners ofurban real estate, stocks and shares, or money amounting to over 1,000 rubles), and also all employees of banks, joint-stock companies, state and public institutions, shall within three days * present to their house committees written statements in three copies over their own signatures, andindicating their address, income, place of employment andtheir occupation. 
 (2) The house committees shall countersign these state-ments, retain one copy and send one copy to the municipal-ity and another to the People’s Commissariat for Internal Affairs (address:.... 
 **). 
 (3) Persons guilty of contravening the present law (fail-ing to submit statements, giving false information, etc. 
)and members of house committees infringing the regulationsgoverning the collection, filing and presentation of these statements to the institutions mentioned above shall be liable to a fine of up to 5,000 rubles for each infringe-ment, or to imprisonment up to one year, or shall be sentto the front, depending on the nature of the offence. 
 (4) Persons sabotaging the work of, or declining to work in, banks, state and public institutions, joint-stock com-panies, railways, etc. 
, shall be liable to similar punish-ment. 
 (5) As a first step towards universal labour conscription, it is decreed that the persons referred to in § 1 shall beobliged, first, constantly to carry with them a copy of theabove-mentioned statement certified by the house com-mittees and by their chiefs or elected officials (factory com-mittees, food committees, railway committees, employees’trade unions, etc. 
); the certificates must indicate what publicservice or work is being performed by the individual inquestion, or whether he is living with his family as a dis-abled member thereof, etc. 
 (6) Secondly, such persons shall be obliged to acquire, within one week from the promulgation of the present law,worker-consumer books (specimen attached), in which theirweekly income and expenditures shall be entered, togetherwith the public duties performed by the individual in *In the manuscript Lenin wrote “within 24 hours” above the words “within three days”.

 Written on December 11 Published according or 12 (24 or 25), 1917 to the manuscript Published for the first time THESES ON THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY 1. 
 The demand for the convocation of a Constituent Assembly was a perfectly legitimate part of the programme of revolutionary Social-Democracy, because in a bourgeois republic the Constituent Assembly represents the highestform of democracy and because, in setting up a Pre-parlia-ment, the imperialist republic headed by Kerensky waspreparing to rig the elections and violate democracy in anumber of ways. 
 2. 
 While demanding the convocation of a Constituent Assembly, revolutionary Social-Democracy has ever sincethe beginning of the Revolution of 1917 repeatedly empha-sised that a republic of Soviets is a higher form of democracythan the usual bourgeois republic with a Constituent As-sembly. 
 3. 
 For the transition from the bourgeois to the socialist system, for the dictatorship of the proletariat, the Republicof Soviets (of Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’ Deputies)is not only a higher type of democratic institution (ascompared with the usual bourgeois republic crowned by aConstituent Assembly), but is the only form capable of securing the most painless transition to socialism. 
 4. 
 The convocation of the Constituent Assembly in our revolution on the basis of lists submitted in the middle ofOctober 1917 is taking place under conditions which pre-clude the possibility of the elections to this ConstituentAssembly faithfully expressing the will of the people in general and of the working people in particular. 
 5. 
 Firstly, proportional representation results in a faith-ful expression of the will of the people only when the party lists correspond to the real division of the people according to the party groupings reflected in those lists. 
 In our case, however, as is well known, the party which from May to October had the largest number of followers among thepeople, and especially among the peasants—the Socialist-Revolutionary Party—came out with united election listsfor the Constituent Assembly in the middle of October 1917,but split in November 1917, after the elections and before the Assembly met. 
 For this reason, there is not, nor can there be, even a for-mal correspondence between the will of the mass of the elec-tors and the composition of the elected Constituent Assembly. 
 6. 
 Secondly, a still more important, not a formal nor legal, but a socio-economic, class source of the discrepancy between the will of the people, and especially the will of the working classes, on the one hand, and the compositionof the Constituent Assembly, on the other, is due to the elec-tions to the Constituent Assembly having taken place ata time when the overwhelming majority of the people couldnot yet know the full scope and significance of the October, Soviet, proletarian-peasant revolution, which began on October 25, 1917, i. 
e. 
, after the lists of candidates for theConstituent Assembly had been submitted. 
 7. 
 The October Revolution is passing through successive stages of development before our very eyes, winning powerfor the Soviets and wresting political rule from the bour-geoisie and transferring it to the proletariat and poor peasantry. 
 8. 
 It began with the victory of October 24-25 in the capital, when the Second All-Russia Congress of Soviets ofWorkers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies, the vanguard of theproletarians and of the most politically active section of the peasants, gave a majority to the Bolshevik Party and put it in power. 
 9. 
 Then, in the course of November and December, the revolution spread to the entire army and peasants, thisbeing expressed first of all in the deposition of the oldleading bodies (army committees, gubernia peasant commit-tees, the Central Executive Committee of the All-Russia Soviet of Peasants’ Deputies, etc. 
)—which expressed thesuperseded, compromising phase of the revolution, its bourgeois, and not proletarian, phase, and which were therefore inevitably bound to disappear under the pressure of the deeper and broader masses of the people—and in the election of new leading bodies in their place. 
 10. 
 This mighty movement of the exploited people for the reconstruction of the leading bodies of their organisa-tions has not ended even now, in the middle of December1917, and the Railwaymen’s Congress, which is still in session, represents one of its stages. 
 11. 
 Consequently, the grouping of the class forces in Russia in the course of their class struggle is in fact assum-ing, in November and December 1917, a form differingin principle from the one that the party lists of candidatesfor the Constituent Assembly compiled in the middle of October 1917 could have reflected. 
 12. 
 Recent events in the Ukraine (partly also in Finland and Byelorussia, as well as in the Caucasus) point similarlyto a regrouping of class forces which is taking place in theprocess of the struggle between the bourgeois nationalismof the Ukrainian Rada, the Finnish Diet, etc. 
, on the one hand, and Soviet power, the proletarian-peasant revolution in each of these national republics, on the other. 
 13. 
 Lastly, the civil war which was started by the Cadet-Kaledin counter-revolutionary revolt against the Sovietauthorities, against the workers’ and peasants’ government,has finally brought the class struggle to a head and has destroyed every chance of setting in a formally democratic way the very acute problems with which history hasconfronted the peoples of Russia, and in the first place herworking class and peasants. 
 14. 
 Only the complete victory of the workers and peas-ants over the bourgeois and landowner revolt (as expressed in the Cadet-Kaledin movement), only the ruthless military suppression of this revolt of the slave-owners can reallysafeguard the proletarian-peasant revolution. 
 The courseof events and the development of the class struggle in therevolution have resulted in the slogan “All Power to theConstituent Assembly!”—which disregards the gains of the workers’ and peasants’ revolution, which disregards Soviet power, which disregards the decisions of the Second All-Russia Congress of Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Depu-ties, of the Second All-Russia Congress of Peasants’ Depu-ties, etc. 
— becoming in fact the slogan of the Cadets and the Kaledinites and of their helpers. 
 The entire people are now fully aware that the Constituent Assembly, if it partedways with Soviet power, would inevitably be doomed topolitical extinction. 
 15. 
 One of the particularly acute problems of national life is the problem of peace. 
 A really revolutionary struggle for peace began in Russia only after the victory of the October 25 Revolution, and the first fruits of this victorywere the publication of the secret treaties, the conclusionof an armistice, and the beginning of open negotiations fora general peace without annexations and indemnities. 
 Only now are the broad sections of the people actually receiving a chance fully and openly to observe the policy of revolutionary struggle for peace and to study its results. 
 At the time of the elections to the Constituent Assembly the mass of the people had no such chance. 
 It is clear that the discrepancy between the composition of the elected Constituent Assembly and the actual will of the people on the question of terminating the war is inevi-table from this point of view too. 
 16. 
 The result of all the above-mentioned circumstances taken together is that the Constituent Assembly, summonedon the basis of the election lists of the parties existing priorto the proletarian-peasant revolution under the rule of the bourgeoisie, must inevitably clash with the will and inter-ests of the working and exploited classes which on October25 began the socialist revolution against the bourgeoisie. 
Naturally, the interests of this revolution stand higher thanthe formal rights of the Constituent Assembly, even ifthose formal rights were not undermined by the absence in the law on the Constituent Assembly of a provision recognis-ing the right of the people to recall their deputies and holdnew elections at any moment. 
 17. 
 Every direct or indirect attempt to consider the question of the Constituent Assembly from a formal, legalpoint of view, within the framework of ordinary bourgeois democracy and disregarding the class struggle and civil war, would be a betrayal of the proletariat’s cause, and theadoption of the bourgeois standpoint. 
 The revolutionary Social-Democrats are duty bound to warn all and sundry against this error, into which a few Bolshevik leaders, who have been unable to appreciate the significance of the October uprising and the tasks of the dictatorship of theproletariat, have strayed. 
 18. 
 The only chance of securing a painless solution to the crisis which has arisen owing to the divergence between theelections to the Constituent Assembly, on the one hand, and the will of the people and the interests of the working and exploited classes, on the other, is for the people to exerciseas broadly and as rapidly as possible the right to elect themembers of the Constituent Assembly anew, and for theConstituent Assembly to accept the law of the Central Exe-cutive Committee on these new elections, to proclaim that it unreservedly recognises Soviet power, the Soviet revolu-tion, and its policy on the questions of peace, the land andworkers’ control, and to resolutely join the camp of theenemies of the Cadet-Kaledin counter-revolution. 
 19. 
 Unless these conditions are fulfilled, the crisis in con-nection with the Constituent Assembly can be settled only in a revolutionary way, by Soviet power adopting the most energetic, speedy, firm and determined revolutionary meas-ures against the Cadet-Kaledin counter-revolution, nomatter behind what slogans and institutions (even partici-pation in the Constituent Assembly) this counter-revolutionmay hide. 
 Any attempt to tie the hands of Soviet power in this struggle would be tantamount to aiding counter-revolution.

 There is no doubt at all that the October Revolution,carried out by the workers, peasants and soldiers, is asocialist one. 
 It is opposed by all the forces of the bourgeoi-sie and the top salaried sections, who have grown accustomed to the old order and cannot understand that the revolution is going to remake the old system from top to bottom. 
 Listento their loud cries that Soviet power is repudiated by themajority in Russia. 
 You know the worth of all this clamour. 
There is a flood of telegrams saying that troops are movingon Petrograd, against the gains of the October Revolution. 
 We throw them into the waste-paper basket, being fully aware that we shall not have to wait long for a refutation. 
The top-drawer organisations of the First Peasant Congress,as represented by the Avksentyevs, said on behalf of thepeasant mass that they were opposed to the rule of tyrantsand usurpers. 
 What we said was: “Let them curse, we shall see what the peasants have to say when we start confiscating the landed estates and giving them to the peasants. 
” As yousee, the Second Peasant Congress has brought victory toSoviet power. 
 We have established close contacts with theSecond Soviet of Peasants’ Deputies. 
 It is with them thatwe have organised the Soviet power of workers, soldiers and peasants. 
 We shall surely find the same attitude among the mass of railwaymen. 
 You are aware that disruption of rail-way communications—aggravated by sabotage on the part of senior officials—is telling on the country. 
 You are aware that a breakdown of railway communications makes impos-sible any balanced exchange between town and country, which is so vital to normal food supplies. 
 Comrades, we needyour help to get the railways going. 
 Only by joining effortswith you can we overcome the disorder and strengthen thepower of the workers, soldiers and peasants. 
 Soviet powerhas no other support than that of the broad working masses. 
 We are sure that the present Railwaymen’s Congress will consolidate the power of the People’s Commissars by settingup an organisation that will help us in the struggle for landand peace. 
 In conclusion, comrades, I extend to you onceagain our greetings and best wishes of fruitful work.

 251, December 14, 1917 FOR BREA D AND PEAC E145 Two questions now take precedence over all other political questions—the question of bread and the question of peace. 
 The imperialist war, the war between the biggest and richestbanking firms, Britain and Germany, that is being wagedfor world domination, the division of the spoils, for the plun-der of small and weak nations; this horrible, criminal warhas ruined all countries, exhausted all peoples, and con-fronted mankind with the alternative—either sacrifice all civilisation and perish or throw off the capitalist yoke in therevolutionary way, do away with the rule of the bourgeoisieand win socialism and durable peace. 
 If socialism is not victorious, peace between the capital-ist states will be only a truce, an interlude, a time of prep-aration for a fresh slaughter of the peoples. 
 Peace and bread are the basic demands of the workers and the exploited. 
 Thewar has made these demands extremely urgent. 
 The war hasbrought hunger to the most civilised countries, to thosemost culturally developed. 
 On the other hand, the war, asa tremendous historical process, has accelerated social development to an unheard-of degree. 
 Capitalism had developed into imperialism, i. 
e. 
, into monopoly capitalism,and under the influence of the war it has become state monop-oly capitalism. 
 We have now reached the stage of worldeconomy that is the immediate stepping stone to social-ism. 
 The socialist revolution that has begun in Russia is, there-fore, only the beginning of the world socialist revolution. 
Peace and bread, the overthrow of the bourgeoisie, revo-lutionary means for the healing of war wounds, the complete victory of socialism—such are the aims of the struggle.

 1917 7/11 1919 , Stockholm SPEECH ON THE NATIONALISATIO N OF THE BANKS DELIVERE D AT A MEETIN G OF THE ALL-RUSSIA CENTRA L EXECUTIV E COMMITTEE DECEMBE R 14 (27), 1917146 MINUTES The last speaker tried to intimidate us by asserting that we are heading towards an abyss, towards certain destruc-tion. 
 There is, however, nothing new for us in this intimi-dation. 
 Novaya Zhizn , the newspaper that expresses the views of the group to which the speaker belongs, said before the October days that our revolution would bring nothing but disorders and anarchic riots. 
 Talk about our travellingthe wrong road is, therefore, a reflection of bourgeois psy-chology that even disinterested people cannot get rid of. 
(Voice from among the internationalists : “Demagogy!”) No, that is not demagogy, it is your constant talk of the axe that is real demagogy. 
 The measures proposed in the decree are only an effective way of ensuring control. 
 You speak of the intricacy of the machinery, of its fragility and of the involved nature of the problem— these are elementary truths that everybody is aware of. 
 But if these truths are merely used to put a brake on all socialist undertakings, we say that anyone who takes thatline is a demagogue, and a dangerous demagogue at that. 
 We want to begin an inventory of the vaults, but the learned specialists tell us there is nothing in them butdocuments and securities. 
 Then what is there bad about representatives of the people checking them? If what they say is true, why do those same learned special-ists who criticise us not come out with it openly? Whenever the Council makes decisions they declare that they agree with us, but only in principle. 
 This is the way of the bour-geois intelligentsia, of all conciliators, who ruin everything with their constant agreement in principle and disagreementin practice. 
 If you know so much about all these things and have the experience, why don’t you help us, why do we meet withnothing but sabotage from you in our difficult task? You proceed from a correct scientific theory, but for us theory forms the basis of actions to be undertaken, it givesus confidence in those actions and does not scare the lifeout of us. 
 Of course it is difficult to make a beginning andwe often come up against fragile things; nevertheless we havecoped with them, are coping with them and shall continue to cope with them. 
 If book-learning were to serve no other purpose than that ofhampering every new step and instilling eternal fear of thenew, it would be useless. 
 Nobody, with the exception of the utopian socialists, has ever asserted that victory is possible without resistance, without the dictatorship of the proletariat and without seizing the old world in an iron grip. 
 You accepted this dictatorship in principle, but when that word is translated into Russian, called an “iron grip”and applied in practice, you warn us of the fragility andinvolved nature of the matter. 
 You stubbornly refuse to see that the iron hand that destroys also creates. 
 It is an undoubted advantage to usto go over from principles to deeds. 
 To effect control we have called upon the bankers and together with them have elaborated measures that theyagreed to, so that loans could be obtained under full control and properly accounted for. 
 But there are people among the bank employees who have the interests of the people atheart and who have told us: “They are deceiving you, makehaste and check their criminal activity that is directlyharmful to you. 
” And we did make haste. 
 We realise that this is an involved measure. 
 None of us, even those who are trained economists, will undertake to carry it out. 
 We shall invite the specialists who are engagedin that work, but only when we have the keys in our own hands. 
 Then we shall even be able to draw advisers from the former millionaires. 
 We invite anybody who wants to work as long as he does not try to reduce every revolution-ary enterprise to mere words; that is something we shallnot stand for. 
 We use the words “dictatorship of the proletar-iat” in all seriousness and we shall effect that dictatorship. 
 We wanted to take the line of agreement with the banks, we gave them loans to finance factories, but they carried out sabotage on an unprecedented scale, and practi-cal experience has forced us to adopt other measures ofcontrol. 
 A comrade from the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries has said that in principle they would vote for the immediatenationalisation of the banks and afterwards work out prac-tical measures in the shortest possible time. 
 But he was wrong in that, because our draft does not contain anythingbut principles. 
 The Supreme Economic Council is waitingto discuss them, but if the decree is not approved the bankswill immediately do everything to further disrupt theeconomy. 
 The adoption of the decree is urgent, otherwise opposition and sabotage will ruin us.

 11 QUESTION S TO DELEGATES TO THE ARM Y CONGRES S ON THE DEMOBILISATION OF THE ARM Y148 (1) Is the likelihood of the Germans starting an offen-sive in the near future great or small— (a) from the viewpoint of the physical and technical possibility of a winter offensive; (b) from the viewpoint of the mood of the mass of the German soldiers; is that mood capable of preventing an offensive, or at least of retarding it? (2) Can it be assumed that the Germans, if we immediate-ly break off peace negotiations, and if their troops imme-diately take the offensive, are capable of inflicting a decisivedefeat upon us? Will they be able to take Petrograd? (3) Is it to be feared that the news of the peace negotia-tions having been broken off will result in widespread anarch-ist sentiments in the army and in desertions from the front, or may we be confident that the army will staunchlyhold the front even after the receipt of such news? (4) Would our army be capable, from the military view-point, of resisting a German offensive, if it began onJanuary 1? If not, when would our army be in a position to resist a German offensive? (5) In the event of a swift German advance, could our army retire in good order and preserve its artillery, and if 50. 
 could the Germans’ advance into the heart of Russia be heldup for long? (6) General conclusion: from the point of view of the state of the army, should we strive to drag out the peace negoti-ations? or would it be preferable to break them off immedi-ately in revolutionary fashion, because of the Germans’ annexationist policy and as a decisive and firm step which would prepare the ground for a possible revolutionary war? (7) Should we at once undertake intensive agitation against the Germans’ annexationist policy and for a revolutionarywar? (8) Would it be possible at very short notice (5-10 days, say) to arrange a canvass of fairly wide sections of the armyat the front with a view to obtaining fuller replies to the above questions in more suitable form? (9) Is it to be hoped that the dissensions with the Ukrain-ians will weaken, or even yield place to a firm consolida-tion of forces when they hear of the Germans’ annexationistdemands, or it may be expected that the Ukrainians willtake advantage of the Great Russians’ greater difficulties to step up the struggle against them? (10) If the army could vote would it be in favour of imme-diate peace on annexationist (loss of the occupied regions)and economically very harsh terms for Russia, or would itfavour the maximum effort for a revolutionary war, i.

 257 FEAR OF THE COLLAPSE OF THE OLD AND THE FIGHT FOR THE NEW The capitalists and their supporters, witting and unwit-ting, are thinking, saying and writing: “The Bolsheviks have now been in power for two months, but instead of a socialist paradise we find the hell of chaos, civil war and evengreater dislocation. 
” We reply: the Bolsheviks have been in power for only two months, but a tremendous step towards socialism hasalready been made. 
 This is not evident only to those who do not wish to see or are unable to analyse the chain of histor-ical events. 
 They refuse to see that in a matter of weeksthe undemocratic institutions in the army, the countrysideand industry have been almost completely destroyed. 
 Thereis no other way—there can be no other way—to socialismsave through such destruction. 
 They refuse to see that in a few weeks, the lying imperialist foreign policy, which dragged out the war and covered up plunder and seizurethrough secret treaties, has been replaced by a truly revolu-tionary-democratic policy working for a really democraticpeace, a policy which has already produced such a great prac-tical success as the armistice and has increased the propa-ganda power of our revolution a hundredfold. 
 They refuse to see that workers’ control and the nationalisation of thebanks are being put into practice, and these are the firststeps towards socialism. 
 Those tyrannised by capitalist routine, shocked by the thundering crash of the old world, and the blast, rumble, and “chaos” (apparent chaos) as the age-old structures of tsarism and the bourgeoisie break up and cave in cannot seethe historical prospects; nor can those who are scared by the class struggle at its highest pitch when it turns into civil war, the only war that is legitimate, just and sacred—not in the clerical but in the human sense—the sacred war of the oppressed to overthrow the oppressors and liberate theworking people from all oppression. 
 Actually all these tyran-nised, shocked and scared bourgeois, petty bourgeois and“those in the service of the bourgeoisie” are frequently guided,without realising it, by that old, absurd, sentimental and vulgar intellectualist idea of “introducing socialism”, which they have acquired from hearsay and scraps of socialisttheory, repeating the distortions of this theory produced byignoramuses and half-scholars, and attributing to us Marx-ists the idea, and even the plan, to “introduce” socialism. 
 To us Marxists these notions, to say nothing of the plans, are alien. 
 We have always known, said and emphasised that socialism cannot be “introduced”, that it takes shapein the course of the most intense, the most acute classstruggle—which reaches heights of frenzy and desperationand civil war; we have always said that a long period of“birth-pangs” lies between capitalism and socialism; that violence is always the midwife of the old society; that a special state (that is, a special system of organised coercionof a definite class) corresponds to the transitional periodbetween the bourgeois and the socialist society, namely, thedictatorship of the proletariat. 
 What dictatorship impliesand means is a state of simmering war, a state of military measures of struggle against the enemies of the proletarian power. 
 The Commune was a dictatorship of the proletariat,and Marx and Engels reproached it for what they consideredto be one of the causes of its downfall, namely, that the Com-mune had not used its armed force with sufficient vigour to suppress the resistance of the exploiters. 
 150 These intellectualist howls about the suppression of capi-talist resistance are actually nothing but an echo of the old“conciliation”, to put it in a “genteel” manner. 
 Putting itwith proletarian bluntness, this means: continued kowtowingto the money-bags is what lies behind the howls againstthe present working-class coercion now being applied (unfortunately, with insufficient pressure or vigour) against the bourgeoisie, the saboteurs and counter-revolutionaries. 
The kind Peshekhonov, one of the conciliating ministers, /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR proclaimed in June 1917: “The resistance of the capitalists has been broken. 
” This kind soul had no inkling of the fact that their resistance must really be broken , and it will be broken, and that the scientific name for this breaking-up operationis dictatorship of the proletariat; that an entire historicalperiod is marked by the suppression of capitalist resistance,and, consequently, by systematic application of coercion to an entire class (the bourgeoisie) and its accomplices. 
 The grasping, malicious, frenzied filthy avidity of the money-bags, the cowed servility of their hangers-on is thetrue social source of the present wail raised by the spinelessintellectuals—from those of Rech to those of Novaya Zhizn — against violence on the part of the proletariat and the revo-lutionary peasants. 
 Such is the objective meaning of their howls, their pathetic speeches, their clownish cries of “free-dom” (freedom for the capitalists to oppress the people),etc. 
 They would be “prepared” to recognise socialism, ifmankind could jump straight into it in one spectacularleap, without any of the friction, the struggles, theexploiters’ gnashing of teeth, or their diverse attempts to preserve the old order, or smuggle it back through the window, without the revolutionary proletariat respondingto each attempt in a violent manner. 
 These spinelesshangers-on of the bourgeoisie with intellectualist pretensionsare quite “prepared” to wade into the water provided theydo not get their feet wet. 
 The drooping intellectuals are terrified when the bour-geoisie and the civil servants, employees, doctors, engineers,etc. 
, who have grown accustomed to serving the bourgeoisie,go to extremes in their resistance. 
 They tremble and uttereven shriller cries about the need for a return to “concili-ation”. 
 Like all true friends of the oppressed class, we can only derive satisfaction from the exploiters’ extreme measures of resistance, because we do not expect the proletariatto mature for power in an atmosphere of cajoling and per-suasion, in a school of mealy sermons or didactic declama-tions, but in the school of life and struggle. 
 To become theruling class and defeat the bourgeoisie for good the prole-tariat must be schooled , because the skill this implies does not come ready-made. 
 The proletariat must do its learningin the struggle, and stubborn, desperate struggle in earnest is the only real teacher. 
 The greater the extremes of the exploiters’ resistance, the more vigorously, firmly, ruthlessly and successfully will they be suppressed by the exploited. 
 The more varied the exploiters’ attempts to uphold the old,the sooner will the proletariat learn to ferret out its enemiesfrom their last nook and corner, to pull up the roots of theirdomination, and cut the very ground which could (and hadto) breed wage-slavery, mass poverty and the profiteering and effrontery of the money-bags. 
 The strength of the proletariat and the peasantry allied to it grows with the resistance of the bourgeoisie and itsretainers. 
 As their enemies, the exploiters, step up theirresistance, the exploited mature and gain in strength; theygrow and learn and they cast out the “old Adam” of wage-slavery. 
 Victory will be on the side of the exploited, for on their side is life, numerical strength, the strength of the mass,the strength of the inexhaustible sources of all that isselfless, dedicated and honest, all that is surging forward andawakening to the building of the new, all the vast reservesof energy and talent latent in the so-called “common people”, the workers and peasants. 
 Victory will be theirs.

 18 to the manuscript Signed: Lenin HOW TO ORGANISE COMPETITION? Bourgeois authors have been using up reams of paper praising competition, private enterprise, and all the othermagnificent virtues and blessings of the capitalists and the capitalist system. 
 Socialists have been accused of refusing to understand the importance of these virtues, and ofignoring “human nature”. 
 As a matter of fact, however,capitalism long ago replaced small, independent commodityproduction, under which competition could develop enter-prise, energy and bold initiative to any considerable extent, by large-and very large-scale factory production, joint-stock companies, syndicates and other monopolies. 
 Undersuch capitalism, competition means the incredibly brutalsuppression of the enterprise, energy and bold initiativeof the mass of the population, of its overwhelming majority, of ninety-nine out of every hundred toilers; it also means that competition is replaced by financial fraud, nepotism, servility on the upper rungs of the social ladder. 
 Far from extinguishing competition, socialism, on the contrary, for the first time creates the opportunity foremploying it on a really wide and on a really mass scale, for actually drawing the majority of working people into a field of labour in which they can display their abilities, develop the capacities, and reveal those talents, so abundantamong the people whom capitalism crushed, suppressed andstrangled in thousands and millions. 
 Now that a socialist government is in power our task is to organise competition. 
 The hangers-on and spongers on the bourgeoisie described socialism as a uniform, routine, monotonous and drab bar-rack system. 
 The lackeys of the money-bags, the lickspittles First page of the manuscript of Lenin’s “How to Organize Competition?”. 
 December 1917 Reduced First page of the manuscript of Lenin’s “How to Organize Competition?”. 
 December 1917 Reduced of the exploiters, the bourgeois intellectual gentlemen used socialism as a bogey to “frighten” the people, who, under capitalism, were doomed to the penal servitude and the barrack-like discipline of arduous, monotonous toil, to alife of dire poverty and semi-starvation. 
 The first steptowards the emancipation of the people from this penal servi-tude is the confiscation of the landed estates, the introductionof workers’ control and the nationalisation of the banks. 
 The next steps will be the nationalisation of the factories, the compulsory organisation of the whole population inconsumers’ societies, which are at the same time societiesfor the sale of products, and the state monopoly of the tradein grain and other necessities. 
 Only now is the opportunity created for the truly mass display of enterprise, competition and bold initiative. 
 Every factory from which the capitalist has been ejected, orin which he has at least been curbed by genuine workers’control, every village from which the landowning exploiterhas been smoked out and his land confiscated has only nowbecome a field in which the working man can reveal his talents, unbend his back a little, rise to his full height, and feel that he is a human being. 
 For the first time aftercenturies of working for others, of forced labour for theexploiter, it has become possible to work for oneself and moreover to employ all the achievements of modern technol-ogy and culture in one’s work. 
 Of course, this greatest change in human history from working under compulsion to working for oneself cannot takeplace without friction, difficulties, conflicts and violenceagainst the inveterate parasites and their hangers-on. 
 Noworker has any illusions on that score. 
 The workers andpoor peasants, hardened by dire want and by many long years of slave labour for the exploiters, by their countless insults and acts of violence, realise that it will take timeto break the resistance of those exploiters. 
 The workers and peasants are not in the least infected with the sentimentalillusions of the intellectual gentlemen, of the Novaya Zhizn crowd and other slush, who “shouted” themselves hoarse “denouncing” the capitalists and “gesticulated” against them, only to burst into tears and to behave like whippedpuppies when it came to deeds , to putting threats into action, to carrying out in practice the work of removing the capi-talists. 
 The great change from working under compulsion to working for oneself, to labour planned and organised on agigantic, national (and to a certain extent international,world) scale, also requires—in addition to “ military ” measures for the suppression of the exploiters’ resistance—tremendousorganisational , organising effort on the part of the prole-tariat and the poor peasants. 
 The organisational task is interwoven to form a single whole with the task of ruthlesslysuppressing by military methods yesterday’s slave-owners(capitalists) and their packs of lackeys—the bourgeoisintellectual gentlemen. 
 Yesterday’s slave-owners and their“intellectual” stooges say and think, “We have always been organisers and chiefs. 
 We have commanded, and we want to continue doing so. 
 We shall refuse to obey the ‘commonpeople’, the workers and peasants. 
 We shall not submit tothem. 
 We shall convert knowledge into a weapon for thedefence of the privileges of the money-bags and of the ruleof capital over the people. 
” That is what the bourgeoisie and the bourgeois intel-lectuals say, think, and do. 
 From the point of view of self-interest their behaviour is comprehensible. 
 The hangers-on and spongers on the feudal landowners, the priests, thescribes, the bureaucrats as Gogol depicted them, and the “in-tellectuals” who hated Belinsky, 151 also found it “hard” to part with serfdom. 
 But the cause of the exploiters and of their “intellectual” menials is hopeless. 
 The workers andpeasants are beginning to break down their resistance—unfortunately, not yet firmly, resolutely and ruthlesslyenough— and break down they will. 
 “They” think that the “common people”, the “common” workers and poor peasants, will be unable to cope with the great, truly heroic, in the world-historic sense of the word,organisational tasks which the socialist revolution has im-posed upon the working people. 
 The intellectuals who areaccustomed to serving the capitalists and the capitaliststate say in order to console themselves: “You cannot do without us. 
” But their insolent assumption has no truth in it; educated men are already making their appearance onthe side of the people, on the side of the working people, and are helping to break the resistance of the servants of capital. 
 There are a great many talented organisers among the peasants and the working class, and they are only just beginning to become aware of themselves, to awaken, tostretch out towards great, vital, creative work, to tacklewith their own forces the task of building socialist society. 
 One of the most important tasks today, if not the most important, is to develop this independent initiative of the workers, and of all the working and exploited people gen-erally, develop it as widely as possible in creative organisa-tional work. 
 At all costs we must break the old, absurd , savage, despicable and disgusting prejudice that only theso-called “upper classes”, only the rich, and those who havegone through the school of the rich, are capable of admin-istering the state and directing the organisational develop-ment of socialist society. 
 This is a prejudice fostered by rotten routine, by petrified views, slavish habits, and still more by the sordid selfish-ness of the capitalists, in whose interest it is to administerwhile plundering and to plunder while administering. 
 The workers will not forget for a moment that they need the power of knowledge. 
 The extraordinary striving after knowl-edge which the workers reveal, particularly now, showsthat mistaken ideas about this do not and cannot existamong the proletariat. 
 But every rank-and-file worker and peasant who can read and write, who can judge people and has practical experience, is capable of organisational work. 
 Among the “common people”, of whom the bourgeois intel-lectuals speak with such haughtiness and contempt, there aremany such men and women. 
 This sort of talent among the working class and the peasants is a rich and still untappedsource. 
 The workers and peasants are still “timid”, they have not yet become accustomed to the idea that they are now the ruling class ; they are not yet resolute enough. 
 The revolu-tion could not at one stroke instil these qualities into mil-lions and millions of people who all their lives had been com-pelled by want and hunger to work under the threat of the stick. 
 But the Revolution of October 1917 is strong, viable and invincible because it awakens these qualities, breaks down the old impediments, removes the worn-out shackles, and leads the working people on to the road of the independent creation of a new life. 
 Accounting and control—this is the main economic task of every Soviet of Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’ Depu-ties, of every consumers’ society, of every union or com-mittee of supplies, of every factory committee or organ ofworkers’ control in general. 
 We must fight against the old habit of regarding the meas-ure of labour and the means of production, from the point of view of the slave whose sole aim is to lighten the burdenof labour or to obtain at least some little bit from the bour-geoisie. 
 The advanced, class-conscious workers have already started this fight, and they are offering determined resistanceto the newcomers who flocked to the factory world in partic-ularly large numbers during the war and who now would like to treat the people ’s factory, the factory that has come into the possession of the people, in the old way, with thesole aim of “snatching the biggest possible piece of the pieand clearing out”. 
 All the class-conscious, honest and think-ing peasants and working people will take their place in this fight by the side of the advanced workers. 
 Accounting and control, if carried on by the Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’ Deputies as the supremestate power, or on the instructions, on the authority, ofthis power—widespread, general, universal accounting and control, the accounting and control of the amount of labour performed and of the distribution of products—is the essence of socialist transformation, once the political rule of the pro-letariat has been established and secured. 
 The accounting and control essential for the transition to socialism can be exercised only by the people. 
 Only thevoluntary and conscientious co-operation of the mass of the workers and peasants in accounting and controlling the rich , the rogues , the idlers and the rowdies , a co-operation marked by revolutionary enthusiasm, can conquer these survivals ofaccursed capitalist society, these dregs of humanity, thesehopelessly decayed and atrophied limbs, this contagion,this plague, this ulcer that socialism has inherited from capitalism. 
 Workers and peasants, working and exploited people! The land, the banks and the factories have now become the property of the entire people! You yourselves must set to work to take account of and control the production and distribution of products—this, and this alone is the road to the victory of socialism, the only guarantee of its victory,the guarantee of victory over all exploitation, over allpoverty and want! For there is enough bread, iron, timber,wool, cotton and flax in Russia to satisfy the needs ofeveryone, if only labour and its products are properly dis-tributed, if only a business-like , practical control over this distribution by the entire people is established, providedonly we can defeat the enemies of the people: the rich andtheir hangers-on, and the rogues, the idlers and the rowdies,not only in politics, but also in everyday economic life. 
 No mercy for these enemies of the people, the enemies of socialism, the enemies of the working people! War to the death against the rich and their hangers-on, the bourgeoisintellectuals; war on the rogues, the idlers and the rowdies!All of them are of the same brood—the spawn of capitalism,the offspring of aristocratic and bourgeois society; thesociety in which a handful of men robbed and insulted the people; the society in which poverty and want forced thou-sands and thousands on to the path of rowdyism, corrup-tion and roguery, and caused them to lose all humansemblance; the society which inevitably cultivated in theworking man the desire to escape exploitation even by meansof deception, to wriggle out of it, to escape, if only for a moment, from loathsome labour, to procure at least a crust of bread by any possible means, at any cost, so as not tostarve, so as to subdue the pangs of hunger suffered by him-self and by his near ones. 
 The rich and the rogues are two sides of the same coin, they are the two principal categories of parasites which capitalism fostered; they are the principal enemies of socialism. 
 These enemies must be placed under the specialsurveillance of the entire people; they must be ruthlesslypunished for the slightest violation of the laws and regula-tions of socialist society. 
 Any display of weakness, hesita-tion or sentimentality in this respect would be an immense crime against socialism. 
 In order to render these parasites harmless to socialist society we must organise the accounting and control of the amount of work done and of production and distribution by the entire people, by millions and millions of workers and peasants, participating voluntarily, energetically and with revolutionary enthusiasm. 
 And in order to organise thisaccounting and control, which is fully within the ability of every honest, intelligent and efficient worker and peasant,we must rouse their organising talent, the talent that is tobe found in their midst; we must rouse among them—and organise on a national scale— competition in the sphere of organisational achievement; the workers and peasants mustbe brought to see clearly the difference between the necessaryadvice of an educated man and the necessary control by the“common” worker and peasant of the slovenliness that is so usual among the “educated”. 
 This slovenliness, this carelessness, untidiness, unpunc-tuality, nervous haste, the inclination to substitutediscussion for action, talk for work, the inclination to under-take everything under the sun without finishing anything,are characteristics of the “educated”; and this is not due tothe fact that they are bad by nature, still less is it due to their evil will; it is due to all their habits of life, the con-ditions of their work, to fatigue, to the abnormal separationof mental from manual labour, and so on, and so forth. 
 Among the mistakes, shortcomings and defects of our revolution a by no means unimportant place is occupied bythe mistakes, etc. 
, which are due to these deplorable—but at present inevitable—characteristics of the intellectuals in our midst, and to the lack of sufficient supervision by the workers over the organisational work of the intellectuals. 
 The workers and peasants are still “timid”; they must get rid of this timidity, and they certainly will get rid of it. 
 We cannot dispense with the advice, the instruction of educated people, of intellectuals and specialists. 
 Every sensible worker and peasant understands this perfectly well, and theintellectuals in our midst cannot complain of a lack of atten-tion and comradely respect on the part of the workers andpeasants. 
 Advice and instruction, however, is one thing, andthe organisation of practical accounting and control is anoth-er. 
 Very often the intellectuals give excellent advice and instruction, but they prove to be ridiculously, absurdly , shamefully “unhandy” and incapable of carrying out this advice and instruction, of exercising practical control over the translation of words into deeds. 
 In this very respect it is utterly impossible to dispense with the help and the leading role of the practical organisers from among the “people”, from among the factory workersand working peasants. 
 “It is not the gods who make pots”—this is the truth that the workers and peasants should getwell drilled into their minds. 
 They must understand that the whole thing now is practical work ; that the historical moment has arrived when theory is being transformed intopractice, vitalised by practice, corrected by practice, testedby practice; when the words of Marx, “Every step of realmovement is more important than a dozen programmes”, 152 become particularly true—every step in really curbing in practice, restricting, fully registering the rich and the rogues and keeping them under control is worth more than a dozenexcellent arguments about socialism. 
 For, “theory, my friend,is grey, but green is the eternal tree of life”. 
 153 Competition must be arranged between practical organ-isers from among the workers and peasants. 
 Every attempt to establish stereotyped forms and to impose uniformity from above, as intellectuals are so inclined to do, must becombated. 
 Stereotyped forms and uniformity imposed fromabove have nothing in common with democratic and social-ist centralism. 
 The unity of essentials, of fundamentals,of the substance, is not disturbed but ensured by variety in details, in specific local features, in methods of approach , in methods of exercising control, in ways of exterminating and rendering harmless the parasites (the rich and the rogues,slovenly and hysterical intellectuals, etc. 
, etc. 
). 
 The Paris Commune gave a great example of how to combine initiative, independence, freedom of action and vigour from below with voluntary centralism free from stereotyped forms. 
 Our Soviets are following the same road. 
But they are still “timid”; they have not yet got into theirstride, have not yet “bitten into” their new, great, creativetask of building the socialist system. 
 The Soviets must setto work more boldly and display greater initiative. 
 All “communes”—factories, villages, consumers’ societies, and committees of supplies—must compete with each other as practical organisers of accounting and control of labour and distribution of products. 
 The programme of this accounting and control is simple, clear and intelligible to all—everyone to have bread; everyone to have sound footwear and good clothing; everyone to have warm dwellings; everyone towork conscientiously; not a single rogue (including thosewho shirk their work) to be allowed to be at liberty, but keptin prison, or serve his sentence of compulsory labour of thehardest kind; not a single rich man who violates the laws and regulations of socialism to be allowed to escape the fate of the rogue, which should, in justice, be the fate of the richman. 
 “He who does not work, neither shall he eat”—this isthe practical commandment of socialism. 
 This is how things should be organised practically . 
 These are the practical successes our “communes” and our worker and peasant organisers should be proud of. 
 And this applies particularly to the organisers among the intellectuals ( particularly , because they are too much , far too much in the habit of being proud of their general instructions and resolutions). 
 Thousands of practical forms and methods of accounting and controlling the rich, the rogues and the idlers must be devised and put to a practical test by the communes themselves, by small units in town and country. 
 Variety is a guarantee ofeffectiveness here, a pledge of success in achieving the singlecommon aim—to clean the land of Russia of all vermin, of fleas—the rogues, of bugs—the rich, and so on and so forth. 
In one place half a score of rich, a dozen rogues, half a dozen workers who shirk their work (in the manner of rowdies, the manner in which many compositors in Petrograd, particu-larly in the Party printing-shops, shirk their work) will beput in prison. 
 In another place they will be put to cleaninglatrines. 
 In a third place they will be provided with “yellowtickets” after they have served their time, so that everyone shall keep an eye on them, as harmful persons, until they reform. 
 In a fourth place, one out of every ten idlers will beshot on the spot. 
 In a fifth place mixed methods may beadopted, and by probational release, for example, the rich,the bourgeois intellectuals, the rogues and rowdies who arecorrigible will be given an opportunity to reform quickly. 
 The more variety there will be, the better and richer will be our general experience, the more certain and rapid willbe the success of socialism, and the easier will it be for practice to devise—for only practice can devise—the best methods and means of struggle. 
 In what commune, in what district of a large town, in what factory and in what village are there no starving people, no unemployed, no idle rich, no despicable lackeys of the bourgeoisie, saboteurs who call themselves intellectuals?Where has most been done to raise the productivity of labour,to build good new houses for the poor, to put the poor in the houses of the rich, to regularly provide a bottle of milk for every child of every poor family? It is on these points thatcompetition should develop between the communes, commu-nities, producer-consumers’ societies and associations, andSoviets of Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’ Deputies. 
 Thisis the work in which talented organisers should come to the fore in practice and be promoted to work in state admin-istration. 
 There is a great deal of talent among the people. 
It is merely suppressed. 
 It must be given an opportunity todisplay itself. 
 It and it alone , with the support of the people, can save Russia and save the cause of socialism.

 Lenin DRAF T DECRE E ON CONSUMER S’ COMMUN ES154 The war, brought about by the conflict between capitalists for the division of the spoils of depredation, has resulted in untold ruin. 
 This is intensified by criminal speculation and profiteering, particularly among the wealthy classes, which have brought the tortures of hunger and unemployment tohundreds of thousands and even millions of people. 
 Theneed to adopt extraordinary measures to aid the starvingand to wage merciless war on speculators has induced theworkers’ and peasants’ government to enact the following regulations as a law of the Russian Republic: Every citizen of the state shall belong to a local (village, volost, hamlet, section of a town, section of a street, etc. 
) consumers’ society. 
 The grouping of families in the consumers’ societies shall be voluntary, except for the proviso that not less than two-thirds of the number of families in each society must belong to the non-affluent classes (i. 
e. 
, workers, peasants notemploying hired labour, and so on). 
 Apart from the purchase and distribution of products, every consumers’ society shall engage in the sale of localproducts. 
 The boards of the consumers’ societies shall set up committees of supplies , and no transport of products shall be permitted without the written sanction of the appropriate committee of supplies. 
 Existing consumers’ societies are hereby nationalised and shall be obliged to admit to membership the wholepopulation of the localities in which they are situated, without exception. 
 If they so desire private individuals may purchase prod-ucts in the central stores and not in their local shops, but only on condition that the relevant entry is made in the book of the local consumers’ society. 
 The transport, purchase and sale of products without a permit from the committees of supplies shall be punishableby the confiscation of the whole of the property of the offend-er, by imprisonment for a period of not less than six monthsand by sentence to compulsory labour. 
 Permits for the transport or the purchase and sale of products shall be drawn up in duplicate and signed by not less than three members of the board of the committee ofsupplies concerned, one copy being filed by the board. 
 Each permit must state from which and to which con-sumers’ society the products are being consigned. 
 Telegraph offices shall give priority to the telegrams of the committees of supplies. 
 All committees of supplies shall act under the control and in accordance with the instructions of the local Sovietsof Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’ Deputies. 
 Every individual shall be entitled to acquire at his con-sumers’ society any product, without any restrictions what-soever, except for such regulations as may be established to limit the import of products from abroad. 
 Products produced for sale must be delivered to the local committee of supplies at uncontrolled prices, exceptin cases when fixed prices are established by law. 
 Moneyreceived for products sold shall be entered to the account of the owners in the local (village, volost, city, factory or other) branch of the People’s Bank. 
 Every Soviet of Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’ Depu-ties must appoint a group of inspectors, auditors and in-structors to assist the population to establish consumers’societies (committees of supplies) and check their accounts and all their business. 
 Instructions on keeping the accounts and on the corre-spondence of the committees of supplies will be issuedseparately.

C. 
 The Council of People’s Commissars regards the Rada’s reply as so indefinite and evasive as to verge on mockery. 
 The main source of difference with the Rada was the factclearly indicated by the Council of People’s Commissars inits first message to the Rada containing the proposal forpeace talks. 
 * The message said that we regarded the Rada’s direct or indirect support of the Kaledinites as unconditional ground for military operations against the Rada. 
 Counter-revolutionary elements of landowners and the bourgeoisiefrom every part of Russia have rallied round Kaledin. 
 Hehas against him a clear majority of the peasants and workingCossacks even in the Don area. 
 It is obvious to everyonethat Soviet power has been accepted by the majority of the population of Russia, above all by the working masses of all nations. 
 The revolutionary movement of the Ukrainianworking classes for the transfer of all power to the Sovietsis assuming ever greater proportions in the Ukraine itselfand holds out the prospect of an early victory over theUkrainian bourgeoisie. 
 The Rada’s evasion of the question of whether it is pre-pared to stop giving direct and indirect support to theKaledinites has wrecked the peace talks we had started andmakes the Rada fully responsible for the continued civilwar which the bourgeois classes of the various nations havelaunched and which is absolutely hopeless, because the over-whelming majority of the workers, peasants and soldiers *See pp.

 have come down solidly on the side of the Soviet Socialist Republic. 
 As for the national demands of the Ukrainians, the inde-pendence of their people’s republic, and its right to federate,these are all recognised by the Council of People’s Commis-sars and are not in dispute at all.

 I greet you as the first heroic volunteers of thesocialist army, who are to build up a mighty revolutionaryarmy. 
 This army is called upon to safeguard the gains of therevolution and our people’s power, the Soviets of Soldiers’, Workers’ and Peasants’ Deputies, the whole of this new and truly democratic system, against the attacks of all theenemies of the people, who are bending all efforts to destroythe revolution. 
 These enemies are the world capitalists whoare now organising a crusade against the Russian revolu-tion, which holds out the prospect of liberation to all working people. 
 We must show that we are a force capable of over-coming every obstacle on the way to world revolution. 
 Letthe example of the comrades going into the trenches buoyup the weak, steady the hesitant and rouse the weary. 
 Thepeoples hear our revolution’s clarion call and are awakening;our army’s ranks will soon be swelled by the proletarian forces of other countries and we shall no longer be alone.

 Russia is hereby proclaimed a Republic of Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’ Deputies. 
 All power, centrally and locally, is vested in these Soviets. 
 2. 
 The Russian Soviet Republic is established on the principle of a free union of free nations, as a federation ofSoviet national republics. 
 Its fundamental aim being to abolish all exploitation of man by man, to completely eliminate the division of societyinto classes, to mercilessly crush the resistance of the exploit-ers, to establish a socialist organisation of society and toachieve the victory of socialism in all countries, the Con-stituent Assembly further resolves: 1. 
 Private ownership of land is hereby abolished. 
 All land together with all buildings, farm implements and otherappurtenances of agricultural production, is proclaimed theproperty of the entire working people. 
 2. 
 The Soviet laws on workers’ control and on the Supreme Economic Council are hereby confirmed for the purpose of guaranteeing the power of the working people over the exploiters and as a first step towards the complete conver-sion of the factories, mines, railways, and other means ofproduction and transport into the property of the workers’and peasants’ state. 
 3. 
 The conversion of all banks into the property of the workers’ and peasants’ state is hereby confirmed as one ofthe conditions for the emancipation of the working peoplefrom the yoke of capital. 
I. 
 II. 
 4. 
 For the purpose of abolishing the parasitic sections of society, universal labour conscription is hereby instituted. 
 5. 
 To ensure the sovereign power of the working people, and to eliminate all possibility of the restoration of the powerof the exploiters, the arming of the working people, thecreation of a socialist Red Army of workers and peasantsand the complete disarming of the propertied classes arehereby decreed. 
 1. 
 Expressing its firm determination to wrest mankind from the clutches of finance capital and imperialism, whichhave in this most criminal of wars drenched the world inblood, the Constituent Assembly whole-heartedly endorsesthe policy pursued by Soviet power of denouncing the secrettreaties, organising most extensive fraternisation with the workers and peasants of the armies in the war, and achieving at all costs, by revolutionary means, a democratic peacebetween the nations, without annexations and indemnitiesand on the basis of the free self-determination of nations. 
 2. 
 With the same end in view, the Constituent Assembly insists on a complete break with the barbarous policy of bourgeois civilisation, which has built the prosperity of the exploiters belonging to a few chosen nations on theenslavement of hundreds of millions of working people inAsia, in the colonies in general, and in the small countries. 
 The Constituent Assembly welcomes the policy of the Council of People’s Commissars in proclaiming the complete independence of Finland, commencing the evacuation of troops from Persia, and proclaiming freedom of self-determ-ination for Armenia. 
 157 3. 
 The Constituent Assembly regards the Soviet law on the cancellation of the loans contracted by the governmentsof the tsar, the landowners and the bourgeoisie as a first blow struck at international banking, finance capital, and expresses the conviction that Soviet power will firmly pursuethis path until the international workers’ uprising againstthe yoke of capital has completely triumphed. 
 Having been elected on the basis of party lists drawn up prior to the October Revolution, when the people were not yet in a position to rise en masse against the exploiters, had not yet experienced the full strength of resistance of thelatter in defence of their class privileges, and had not yetIII.

 applied themselves in practice to the task of building social-ist society, the Constituent Assembly considers that it would be fundamentally wrong, even formally, to put itself in opposition to Soviet power. 
 In essence the Constituent Assembly considers that now, when the people are waging the last fight against theirexploiters, there can be no place for exploiters in any govern-ment body. 
 Power must be vested wholly and entirely in the working people and their authorised representatives—the Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’ Deputies. 
 Supporting Soviet power and the decrees of the Council of People’s Commissars, the Constituent Assembly considersthat its own task is confined to establishing the fundamentalprinciples of the socialist reconstruction of society. 
 At the same time, endeavouring to create a really free and voluntary, and therefore all the more firm and stable,union of the working classes of all the nations of Russia, theConstituent Assembly confines its own task to setting upthe fundamental principles of a federation of Soviet Repub-lics of Russia, while leaving it to the workers and peasants of each nation to decide independently at their own authori-tative Congress of Soviets whether they wish to participatein the federal government and in the other federal Sovietinstitutions, and on what terms.

 I whole-heartedly welcome your confidence that you will succeed in the great task of building a socialist army —in view of all the present diffi-culties and in spite of them. 
 We may be in one of the criticalperiods of the revolution, when Soviet power is threatenedboth by an external foe—the German and other imperial-ists—and an internal one—the counter-revolutionaries hiding behind the slogan of “All Power to the ConstituentAssembly”. 
 We shall overcome this crisis as well. 
 There is not the least doubt about it. 
 The Soviets will retain the power theyhave won. 
 The socialist revolution has begun. 
 It will go on to victory in Russia and the whole world.

 (BOLSHEVIK S) GROU P AT THE CONSTITUEN T ASSEMBL Y MEETING JANUARY 5 (18), 191 8158 The vast majority of working Russia—workers, peasants and soldiers—have demanded that the Constituent Assembly should recognise the gains of the Great October Revolution, the Soviet decrees on land, peace and workers’ control, andabove all the power of the Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’and Peasants’ Deputies. 
 The All-Russia Central ExecutiveCommittee, fulfilling the will of the vast majority of theworking classes of Russia, has proposed that the Constituent Assembly should declare itself bound by this will. 
 However, the majority of the Constituent Assembly—in line with thepretensions of the bourgeoisie, has rejected this proposal,thereby challenging the whole of working Russia. 
 The majority in the Constituent Assembly went to the Party of the Right Socialist-Revolutionaries, the party of Kerensky, Avksentyev and Chernov. 
 This party, which calls itself socialist and revolutionary, is leading the fightof the bourgeois elements against the workers’ and peasants’revolution and is in fact a bourgeois and counter-revolution-ary party. 
 The Constituent Assembly, as at present constituted, is the result of the balance of forces obtaining before the GreatOctober Revolution. 
 The present counter-revolutionarymajority of the Constituent Assembly elected on outdatedparty lists, is a reflection of an earlier period of the revolu-tion and is trying to throw up a roadblock in the way ofthe workers’ and peasants’ movement. 
 The day-long debate has shown that the Party of Right Socialist-Revolutionaries continues, as it did under Keren-sky, to lavish the people with promises of all manner of things; actually it has decided to fight against the power of the workers’, peasants’ and soldiers’ Soviets, against the socialist measures, the transfer of land and all imple-ments to the peasants without compensation, the national-isation of banks, and the repudiation of the state debt. 
 Refusing for a single moment to cover up the crimes of the enemies of the people, we make this announcement ofour withdrawal from the Constituent Assembly, leaving it to Soviet power to take the final decision on the attitude to the counter-revolutionary section of the Constituent Assem-bly. 
 Pravda No. 
 5 (evening edition), Published according January 19 (6), 1918 to the Pravda text PEOPLE ANOTHER WORLD “Friends, I have lost a day,” says an old Latin tag. 
 One cannot help but recall it when one remembers how the fifth of January was lost. 
 After real, lively, Soviet work among workers and peasants engaged on real tasks , clearing the forest and uprooting the stumps of landowner and capitalist exploitation, we weresuddenly transported to “another world”, to arrivals fromanother world, from the camp of the bourgeoisie with its willing or unwilling, conscious or unconscious champions, with its hangers-on, servants and advocates. 
 Out of the worldin which the working people and their Soviet organisationwere conducting the struggle against the exploiters we weretransported to the world of saccharine phrases, of slick,empty declamations, of promises and more promises based, as before, on conciliation with the capitalists. 
 It is as though history had accidentally, or by mistake, turned its clock back, and January 1918 for a single daybecame May or June 1917! It was terrible! To be transported from the world of living people into the company of corpses, to breathe the odour of the dead, to hear those mummies with their empty “social” Louis Blanc 159 phrases, to hear Chernov and Tsere-teli, was simply intolerable. 
 Comrade Skvortsov was right when he rapped out to the Right Socialist-Revolutionaries these two or three briefphrases, simple, calm and at the same time ruthlessly cut-ting: “Between us everything is over. 
 We are carrying the October Revolution against the bourgeoisie to its culmi-nation. 
 We and you are on different sides of the barricades. 
” In reply to that came a torrent of over-smooth, empty phrases from Chernov and Tsereteli that carefully avoided only (only!) one question—that of Soviet power, of the Octo-ber Revolution. 
 “Let there be no civil war, let there be nosabotage,” said Chernov, invoking the revolution in thename of the Right Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
 And the latterwho for six months, from June 1917 to January 1918, hadbeen sleeping like corpses in their coffins, stood up and clapped furiously and persistently. 
 It is really so easy and so pleasant to settle the problems of the revolution by an incan-tation. 
 “Let there be no civil war, let there be no sabotage, leteverybody recognise the Constituent Assembly. 
” In what waydoes that differ, in essence, from the invocation: “Let theworkers and capitalists make peace”? Not in any way. 
 The Kaledins and Ryabushinskys together with their imperial-ist friends in all countries will not disappear or change theirpolicy because of the invocations of the mealy-mouthedChernov or because of Tsereteli’s boring precepts that seemto have been taken from a misunderstood, poorly read andmisinterpreted book. 
 Either conquer the Kaledins and Ryabushinskys or give up the revolution. 
 Either victory over the exploiters in thecivil war, or the collapse of the revolution. 
 Such has beenthe issue in all revolutions, in the English revolution in the seventeenth century, in the French in the eighteenth cen-tury and in the German in the nineteenth century. 
 How could it be thought that the Russian revolution in the twen-tieth century would not face that issue? How can wolves become lambs? Tsereteli and Chernov do not show a grain of an idea, not the slightest desire to accept the fact of the class strugglethat has become civil war, not by chance, not suddenly, not because of somebody’s caprice or ill will, but inevitably, in the long process of revolutionary development. 
 It was a hard, boring and irksome day in the elegant rooms of the Taurida Palace, whose very aspect differs from thatof Smolny approximately in the same way as elegant, butmoribund bourgeois parliamentarism differs from the plain, proletarian Soviet apparatus that is in many ways still disorderly and imperfect but is living and vital. 
 There, inthat old world of bourgeois parliamentarism, the leaders of hostile classes and hostile groups of the bourgeoisie did their fencing . 
 Here, in the new world of the proletarian and peasant, socialist state, the oppressed classes are making clumsy, inefficient....

 DRAF T DECRE E ON THE DISSOLUTION OF THE CONSTITUEN T ASSEMB LY160 At its very inception, the Russian revolution produced the Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’ Deputies as the only mass organisation of all the working and exploited classes capable of leading the struggle of these classes fortheir complete political and economic emancipation. 
 During the whole of the initial period of the Russian revolution the Soviets multiplied in number, grew andgained strength and were taught by their own experience to discard the illusions of compromise with the bourgeoisie and to realise the deceptive nature of the forms of the bourgeois-democratic parliamentary system; they arrived by practicalexperience at the conclusion that the emancipation of theoppressed classes was impossible unless they broke withthese forms and with every kind of compromise. 
 The break came with the October Revolution, which transferred the entire power to the Soviets. 
 The Constituent Assembly, elected on the basis of electoral lists drawn up prior to the October Revolution, was anexpression of the old relation of political forces whichexisted when power was held by the compromisers and the Cadets. 
 When the people at that time voted for the candi-dates of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, they were notin a position to choose between the Right Socialist-Revo-lutionaries, the supporters of the bourgeoisie, and the LeftSocialist-Revolutionaries, the supporters of socialism. 
 TheConstituent Assembly, therefore, which was to have crowned the bourgeois parliamentary republic, was bound to become an obstacle in the path of the October Revolution and Sovietpower. 
 The October Revolution, by giving power to the Soviets, and through the Soviets to the working and exploited classes, aroused the desperate resistance of the exploiters, and in the crushing of this resistance it fully revealed itself at thebeginning of the socialist revolution. 
 The working classeslearned by experience that the old bourgeois parliamentarysystem had outlived its purpose and was absolutely incom-patible with the aim of achieving socialism, and that not national institutions, but only class institutions (such as the Soviets) were capable of overcoming the resistance of thepropertied classes and of laying the foundations of socialistsociety. 
 To relinquish the sovereign power of the Soviets,to relinquish the Soviet Republic won by the people, forthe sake of the bourgeois parliamentary system and the Con-stituent Assembly, would now be a step backwards and would cause the collapse of the October workers’ and peas-ants’ revolution. 
 Owing to the above-mentioned circumstances, the Party of Right Socialist-Revolutionaries, the party of Kerensky,Avksentyev and Chernov, obtained the majority in the Constituent Assembly which met on January 5. 
 Naturally, this party refused to discuss the absolutely clear, precise andunambiguous proposal of the supreme organ of Soviet po-wer, the Central Executive Committee of the Soviets, torecognise the programme of Soviet power, to recognise theDeclaration of Rights of the Working and Exploited Peo-ple, to recognise the October Revolution and Soviet power. 
 By this action the Constituent Assembly severed all tieswith the Soviet Republic of Russia. 
 It was inevitable thatthe Bolshevik group and the Left Socialist-Revolutionarygroup, who now patently constitute the overwhelming major-ity in the Soviets and enjoy the confidence of the workers and the majority of the peasants, should withdraw from such a Constituent Assembly. 
 The Right Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik parties are in fact carrying on outside the Constituent Assemblya most desperate struggle against Soviet power, calling open-ly in their press for its overthrow and describing as arbi-trary and unlawful the crushing of the resistance of the exploiters by the forces of the working classes, which isessential in the interests of emancipation from exploita-tion. 
 They are defending the saboteurs, the servants of capital, and are going as far as undisguised calls to terro-rism, which certain “unidentified groups” have already begun. 
 It is obvious that under such circumstances theremaining part of the Constituent Assembly could onlyserve as a screen for the struggle of the counter-revolutiona-ries to overthrow Soviet power. 
 Accordingly, the Central Executive Committee resolves that the Constituent Assembly is hereby dissolved.

 5, Published according January 7, 1918 to the manuscript SPEECH ON THE DISSOLUTION OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY DELIVERED TO THE ALL -RUSSIA CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE JANUARY 6 (19), 1918 Comrades, the clash between Soviet power and the Con-stituent Assembly results from the entire course of the Russian revolution, which was confronted by the unprece-dented task of reconstructing society on socialist lines. 
 Afterthe events of 1905 there could be no doubt that tsarism’s daywas over and that it had scrambled out of the pit only becauseof the backwardness and ignorance of the rural population. 
 The Revolution of 1917 was marked on the one hand by the transformation of the bourgeois imperialist party into arepublican party under the pressure of events, and on theother hand, by the emergence of democratic organisations,the Soviets, that had been formed in 1905; even then thesocialists had realised that the organisation of these Soviets was creating something great, something new and unprec-edented in the history of world revolution. 
 The Soviets,created solely by the initiative of the people, are a form ofdemocracy without parallel in any other country of theworld. 
 The revolution produced two forces—the union of the masses for the purpose of overthrowing tsarism, and the organisations of the working people. 
 When I hear the enemiesof the October Revolution exclaim that the ideas of social-ism are unfeasible and utopian, I usually put to them aplain and simple question. 
 What in their opinion, I ask, arethe Soviets? What gave rise to these organisations of the people, which have no precedent in the history of the devel-opment of world revolution? Not one of them has been ableto give a precise answer to this question. 
 Defending the bourgeois system by inertia, they oppose these powerful organisations, the formation of which has never before been witnessed in any revolution in the world. 
 All who are fight-ing the landowners are joining forces with the Soviets ofPeasants’ Deputies. 
 The Soviets embrace all who do not wishto stand idle and are devoting themselves to creative work. 
They have spread their network over the whole country, andthe denser this network of Soviets of the people, the less will it be possible to exploit the working people. 
 For the existence of the Soviets is incompatible with a prosperousbourgeois system. 
 That is the source of all the contradictionsamong the bourgeoisie, who are fighting our Soviets solelyin their own interests. 
 The transition from capitalism to a socialist system entails a long and bitter struggle. 
 Having overthrown tsarism, the Russian revolution was bound to go farther; it could notstop at the victory of the bourgeois revolution; for the war,and the untold sufferings it caused the exhausted peoples,created a soil favourable for the outbreak of the socialrevolution. 
 Nothing, therefore, is more ludicrous than the assertion that the subsequent development of the revolution, and the revolt of the masses that followed, were caused bya party, by an individual, or, as they vociferate, by thewill of a “dictator”. 
 The fire of revolution broke out solelybecause of the incredible sufferings of Russia, and becauseof the conditions created by the war, which sternly and inexorably faced the working people with the alternative of taking a bold, desperate and fearless step, or of perishing,of dying from starvation. 
 And revolutionary fire was manifest in the creation of the Soviets—the mainstay of the workers’ revolution. 
 TheRussian people have made a gigantic advance, a leap from tsarism to the Soviets. 
 That is a fact, irrefutable and unpa^ ralleled. 
 While the bourgeois parliaments of all countries andstates, confined within the bounds of capitalism and privateproperty, have never anywhere supported a revolutionarymovement, the Soviets, having lit the fire of revolution,imperatively command the people to fight, take everything into their own hands, and organise themselves. 
 In the course of a revolution called forth by the strength of theSoviets there are certain to be all kinds of errors and blunders. 
 But everybody knows that revolutionary movements are always and inevitably accompanied by temporary chaos, destruction and disorder. 
 Bourgeois society is the same war, the same shambles; and it was this circumstance that gaverise to and accentuated the conflict between the ConstituentAssembly and the Soviets. 
 Those who point out that we arenow “dissolving” the Constituent Assembly although at onetime we defended it are not displaying a grain of sense, but are merely uttering pompous and meaningless phrases. 
 At one time, we considered the Constituent Assembly to bebetter than tsarism and the republic of Kerensky with theirfamous organs of power; but as the Soviets emerged, they,being revolutionary organisations of the whole people,naturally became incomparably superior to any parliament in the world, a fact that I emphasised as far back as last April. 
 By completely smashing bourgeois and landed prop-erty and by facilitating the final upheaval which is sweepingaway all traces of the bourgeois system, the Soviets impelledus on to the path that has led the people to organise theirown lives. 
 We have taken up this great work of organisation, and it is well that we have done so. 
 Of course, the socialist revolution cannot be immediately presented to the peoplein a clean, neat and impeccable form; it will inevitably beaccompanied by civil war, sabotage and resistance. 
 Thosewho assert the contrary are either liars or cowards. 
 ( Stormy applause. 
 ) The events of April 20, when the people, without any directions from “dictators” or parties, came out inde-pendently and solidly against the government of compromis-ers, showed even then that the bourgeoisie were weak andhad no solid support. 
 The masses sensed their power, andto placate them the famous game of ministerial leapfrogbegan, the object of which was to fool the people. 
 But the people very soon saw through the game, particularly after Kerensky, both his pockets stuffed with predatory secrettreaties with the imperialists, began to move the armies foran offensive. 
 Gradually the activities of the compromisersbecame obvious to the deceived people, whose patiencebegan to be exhausted. 
 The result was the October Revolu-tion. 
 The people learned by experience, having suffered torture, executions and wholesale shootings and it is non-sense for the butchers to assert that the Bolsheviks, or cer-tain “dictators”, are responsible for the revolt of the working people. 
 They are given the lie by the split that is occurring among the people themselves at congresses, meetings, con-ferences, and so forth. 
 The people have not yet fully under-stand the October Revolution. 
 This revolution has shown inpractice how the people must take into their own hands,the hands of the workers’ and peasants’ state, the land, thenatural resources, and the means of transport and production. 
 Our cry was, All power to the Soviets; it is for this we are fighting. 
 The people wanted the Constituent Assembly sum-moned, and we summoned it. 
 But they sensed immediatelywhat this famous Constituent Assembly really was. 
 Andnow we have carried out the will of the people, which is—All power to the Soviets. 
 As for the saboteurs, we shall crush them. 
 When I came from Smolny, that fount of life and vigour, to the Taurida Palace, I felt as though I werein the company of corpses and lifeless mummies. 
 Theydrew on all their available resources in order to fight social-ism, they resorted to violence and sabotage, they even turnedknowledge—the great pride of humanity—into a means of exploiting the working people. 
 But although they mana-ged to hinder somewhat the advance towards the socialistrevolution, they could not stop it and will never be able to. 
Indeed the Soviets that have begun to smash the old, out-worn foundations of the bourgeois system, not in gen-tlemanly, but in a blunt proletarian and peasant fashion, are much too strong. 
 To hand over power to the Constituent Assembly would again be compromising with the malignant bourgeoisie. 
The Russian Soviets place the interests of the working peoplefar above the interests of a treacherous policy of compromisedisguised in a new garb. 
 The speeches of those outdated politicians, Chernov and Tsereteli, who continue whining tediously for the cessation of civil war, give off the staleand musty odour of antiquity. 
 But as long as Kaledin exists,and as long as the slogan “All power to the ConstituentAssembly” conceals the slogan “Down with Soviet power”,civil war is inevitable. 
 For nothing in the world will make us give up Soviet power! ( Stormy applause . 
) And when the Constituent Assembly again revealed its readiness to post-pone all the painfully urgent problems and tasks that were placed before it by the Soviets, we told the Constituent Assembly that they must not be postponed for one single moment. 
 And by the will of Soviet power the Constituent Assembly, which has refused to recognise the power of thepeople, is being dissolved. 
 The Ryabushinskys have lost theirstakes; their attempts at resistance will only accentuateand provoke a new outbreak of civil war. 
 The Constituent Assembly is dissolved. 
 The Soviet revo-lutionary republic will triumph, no matter what the cost.

 6, Published according January 22 (9), 1918 to the Pravda text ON THE HISTORY OF THE QUESTION OF THE UNFORTUNATE PEACE It might be argued that this is no time to deal with his-tory. 
 Certainly, this kind of assertion would be permissible if a particular question from the past were not inseparably and directly connected in practice with the present. 
 Thequestion of the unfortunate peace, the exceptionally harshpeace is, however, such a burning question that it calls forelucidation. 
 I am therefore publishing my theses on thissubject that were read at a meeting of about sixty of the leading Petrograd Party functionaries on January 8, 1918. 
 Here are these theses: January 7, 1918. 
 THESES ON THE QUESTION OF THE IMMEDIATE CONCLUSION OF A SEPARATE AND ANNEXATIONIST PEACE161 1. 
 The position of the Russian revolution at the present moment is such that nearly all the workers and the vastmajority of the peasants undoubtedly side with Soviet power and the socialist revolution which it has started. 
 To that extent the socialist revolution in Russia is assured. 
 2. 
 At the same time, the civil war, provoked by the frantic resistance of the wealthy classes, who realise full wellthat they are faced with the last and decisive fight for thepreservation of private ownership of the land and means of production, has not yet reached its climax. 
 The victory of Soviet power in this war is assured, but some time mustinevitably elapse, no little exertion of effort will inevitably be required, a certain period of acute economic dislocation and chaos, which accompany all wars, and civil war in par-ticular, is inevitable, before the resistance of the bourgeoisie is crushed. 
 3. 
 Furthermore, this resistance, in its less active and non-military forms—sabotage, the hire of declassed elementsand agents of the bourgeoisie, who worm their way into theranks of the socialists in order to ruin their cause, and so on and so forth—has proved so stubborn and capable of assum-ing such diversified forms, that the fight against it willinevitably require some more time, and, in its main forms,is hardly likely to end until several months have passed. 
And unless this passive and covert resistance of the bour-geoisie and its supporters is definitely crushed the socialist revolution cannot succeed. 
 4. 
 Lastly, the organisational problems of the socialist transformation of Russia are so immense and difficult thattheir solution—in view of the numerous petty-bourgeoisfellow-travellers of the socialist proletariat, and of the lat-ter’s low cultural level—will also require a fairly long time. 
 5. 
 All these circumstances taken together are such as to make it perfectly clear that for the success of socialism inRussia a certain amount of time, several months at least,will be necessary, during which the hands of the socialistgovernment must be absolutely free to achieve victory overthe bourgeoisie first in our own country and to launch far-reaching mass organisational work on a wide scale. 
 6. 
 The position of the socialist revolution in Russia must form the basis of any definition of the international tasksof our Soviet power, for the international situation in thefourth year of the war is such that it is quite impossible topredict the probable moment of outbreak of revolution and overthrow of any of the European imperialist governments (including the German). 
 That the socialist revolution inEurope must come, and will come, is beyond doubt. 
 Allour hopes for the final victory of socialism are founded on this certainty and on this scientific prognosis. 
 Our propa-ganda activities in general, and the organisation of frater-nisation in particular, must be intensified and extended. 
 It would be a mistake, however, to base the tactics of theRussian socialist government on attempts to determine whether or not the European, and especially the German, socialist revolution will take place in the next six months (or some such brief period). 
 Inasmuch as it is quite impossible to determine this, all such attempts, objectively speaking,would be nothing but a blind gamble. 
 7. 
 The peace negotiations in Brest-Litovsk have by now— January 7, 1918—made it perfectly clear that the war partyhas undoubtedly gained the upper hand in the German Government (which has the other governments of the Quad-ruple Alliance at its beck and call) and has virtually alreadypresented Russia with an ultimatum (and it is to be expect-ed, most certainly to be expected, that any day now itwill be presented formally). 
 The ultimatum is as follows:either the continuation of the war, or a peace with annexa-tions, i. 
e. 
, peace on condition that we surrender all the territory we have occupied, while the Germans retain allthe territory they have occupied and impose upon us anindemnity (outwardly disguised as payment for the main-tenance of prisoners)—an indemnity of about three thousandmillion rubles, payable over a number of years. 
 8. 
 The socialist government of Russia is faced with the question—a question whose solution brooks no delay—ofwhether to accept this peace with annexations now, or toimmediately wage a revolutionary war. 
 In fact, no middlecourse is possible. 
 No further postponement can now beachieved, for we have already done everything possible and impossible to deliberately protract the negotiations. 
 9. 
 On examining the arguments in favour of an immediate revolutionary war, the first argument we encounter is thata separate peace at this juncture would, objectively speak-ing, be an agreement with the German imperialists, an“imperialistic deal”, and so forth, and that, consequently, such a peace would mean a complete break with the funda-mental principles of proletarian internationalism. 
 This argument, however, is obviously incorrect. 
 Workers who lose a strike and sign terms for the resumption of workwhich are unfavourable to them and favourable to the capi-talists, do not betray socialism. 
 The only people who betray socialism are those who secure advantages for a section of the workers in exchange for profit to the capitalists; onlysuch agreements are impermissible in principle. 
 He betrays socialism who calls the war with German imperialism a defensive and just war, but actually receives support from the Anglo-French imperialists, and conceals secret treaties concluded with them from the people. 
 Hedoes not in the least betray socialism who, without conceal-ing anything from the people, and without concluding anysecret treaties with the imperialists, agrees to sign terms ofpeace which are unfavourable to the weak nation and favour-able to the imperialists of one group, if at that moment there is no strength to continue the war. 
 10. 
 Another argument in favour of immediate war is that, by concluding peace, we objectively become agents ofGerman imperialism, for we afford it the opportunity torelease troops from our front, we surrender to it millions of prisoners of war, and so on. 
 But this argument too is manifestly incorrect, for a revolutionary war at the presentjuncture would, objectively speaking, make us agents ofAnglo-French imperialism, by providing it with forces whichwould promote its aims. 
 The British bluntly offered ourCommander-in-Chief, Krylenko, one hundred rubles per month for every one of our soldiers provided we continued the war. 
 Even if we did not take a single kopek from theAnglo-French, we nevertheless would be helping them,objectively speaking, by diverting part of the Germanarmy. 
 From that point of view, in neither case would we be entirely escaping some sort of imperialist bond, and it is obvious that it is impossible to escape it completely withoutoverthrowing world imperialism. 
 The correct conclusionfrom this is that the moment a socialist government tri-umphed in any one country, questions must be decided, notfrom the point of view of whether this or that imperialism is preferable, but exclusively from the point of view of the conditions which best make for the development and conso-lidation of the socialist revolution which has already begun. 
 In other words, the underlying principle of our tactics must not be, which of the two imperialisms it is more prof-itable to aid at this juncture, but rather, how the socialist revolution can be most firmly and reliably ensured the possibility of consolidating itself, or, at least, of maintain-ing itself in one country until it is joined by other countries. 
 11. 
 It is said that the German Social-Democratic oppo-nents of the war have now become “defeatists” and are requesting us not to yield to German imperialism. 
 But we recognised defeatism only in respect of one’s own imperial-ist bourgeoisie, and we always discountenanced victoryover an alien imperialism, victory attained in formal oractual alliance with a “friendly” imperialism, as a methodimpermissible in principle and generally wrong. 
 This argument is therefore only a modification of the previous one. 
 If the German Left Social-Democrats wereproposing that we delay concluding a separate peace for adefinite period, and guaranteed revolutionary action in Germany within this period, the question might assume a different aspect for us. 
 Far from saying this, however, the German Lefts formally declare: “Hold out as long as you can, but decide the question from the point of view of the stateof affairs in the Russian socialist revolution, for we cannot promise you anything positive regarding the German revo-lution. 
” 12. 
 It is said that in a number of Party statements we actually “promised” a revolutionary war, and that by con-cluding a separate peace we would be going back on ourword. 
 That is not true. 
 We said that in the era of imperialism a socialist government had to “prepare for and wage ” a revo-lutionary war *; we said this in order to combat abstract pacifism and the theory that “defence of the fatherland” must be completely rejected in the era of imperialism,and, lastly to combat the purely selfish instincts of a partof the soldiers, but we never gave any pledge to start a revo-lutionary war without considering whether it is possible towage it at a given moment. 
 Unquestionably, even at this juncture we must prepare for a revolutionary war. 
 We are carrying out this promise, as we have, in general, carried out all our promises thatcould be carried out at once: we annulled the secret treaties,offered all peoples a fair peace, and several times did ourbest to drag out peace negotiations so as to give other peo-ples a chance to join us.

 /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR But the question whether it is possible to carry on a revolutionary war now , immediately , must be decided exclu-sively from the point of view of whether material conditions permit it, and of the interests of the socialist revolutionwhich has already begun. 
 13. 
 Summing up the arguments in favour of an immediate revolutionary war, we have to conclude that such a policymight perhaps answer the human yearning for the beautiful, dramatic and striking, but that it would totally disregard the objective balance of class forces and material factors atthe present stage of the socialist revolution now under way. 
 14. 
 There can be no doubt that our army is absolutely in no condition at the present moment, and will not be forthe next few weeks (and probably for the next few months), to beat back a German offensive successfully; firstly, owing to the extreme fatigue and exhaustion of the majority of thesoldiers, coupled with the incredible chaos in the matter offood supply, replacement of the overfatigued, etc. 
; second-ly, owing to the utter unfitness of the horses and the con-sequent inevitable ruin of our artillery; and, thirdly, owing to the absolute impossibility of defending the coastline from Riga to Revel, which affords the enemy a very certainchance of seizing the rest of Lifland, and then Estland, andof outflanking a large part of our forces, and finally, ofcapturing Petrograd. 
 15. 
 Further, there is not the slightest doubt that the peasant majority of our army would at the present juncture unreservedly declare in favour of a peace with annexationsand not in favour of an immediate revolutionary war; thesocialist reorganisation of the army, the merging of theRed Guard detachments with it, and so on, have only justbegun. 
 With the army completely democratised, to carry on war in defiance of the wishes of the majority of the soldierswould be a reckless gamble, while to create a really staunchand ideologically stable socialist workers’ and peasants’army will, at the very least, require months and months. 
 16. 
 The poor peasants in Russia are capable of supporting the socialist revolution led by the working class, but they are not capable of agreeing to fight a serious revolutionarywar immediately, at the present juncture. 
 To ignore the objective balance of class forces on this issue would be a fatal error. 
 17. 
 Consequently, the situation at present with regard to a revolutionary war is as follows: If the German revolution were to break out and triumph in the coming three or four months, the tactics of an immedi-ate revolutionary war might perhaps not ruin our socialistrevolution. 
 If, however, the German revolution does not occur in the next few months, the course of events, if the war is con-tinued, will inevitably be such that grave defeats willcompel Russia to conclude an even more disadvantageousseparate peace, a peace, moreover, which would be conclud-ed, not by a socialist government, but by some other (for example, a bloc of the bourgeois Rada and Chernov’s follo-wers, or something similar). 
 For the peasant army, which isexhausted to the limit by the war, will after the very firstdefeats—and very likely within a matter of weeks, and notof months—overthrow the socialist workers’ government. 
 18. 
 This being the state of affairs, it would be absolutely impermissible tactics to stake the fate of the socialist revo-lution, which has already begun in Russia, merely on thechance that the German revolution may begin in the imme-diate future, within a matter of weeks. 
 Such tactics wouldbe a reckless gamble. 
 We have no right to take suchrisks. 
 19. 
 The German revolution will by no means be made more difficult of accomplishment as far as its objectivepremises are concerned, if we conclude a separate peace. 
Probably chauvinist intoxication will weaken it for a time,but Germany’s position will remain extremely grave, thewar with Britain and America will be a protracted one, and aggressive imperialism will be fully and completely exposed on both sides. 
 A socialist Soviet Republic in Russia willstand as a living example to the peoples of all countries,and the propaganda and revolutionising effect of this examplewill be immense. 
 There—the bourgeois system and a fullyexposed predatory war between two groups of marauders. 
 Here—peace and a socialist Soviet Republic. 
 20. 
 In concluding a separate peace we free ourselves as much as is possible at the present moment from both hostile imperialist groups, we take advantage of their mutual en-mity and warfare which hamper concerted action on their part against us, and for a certain period have our hands free to advance and to consolidate the socialist revolution. 
 Thereorganisation of Russia on the basis of the dictatorshipof the proletariat, and the nationalisation of the banks andlarge-scale industry, coupled with exchange of products in kind between the towns and the small-peasant consumers’ socie-ties, is quite feasible economically, provided we are assured a few months in which to work in peace. 
 And such a reorga-nisation will render socialism invincible both in Russiaand all over the world, and at the same time will create asolid economic basis for a mighty workers’ and peasants’Red Army. 
 21. 
 A really revolutionary war at this juncture would be a war waged by a socialist republic against the bourgeoiscountries, with the aim—an aim clearly defined and fullyapproved by the socialist army—of overthrowing the bour-geoisie in other countries. 
 However, we obviously cannot set ourselves this aim at the present moment. 
 Objectively, we would be fighting now for the liberation of Poland, Lifland and Courland. 
 But no Marxist, without renouncingthe principles of Marxism and of socialism generally, candeny that the interests of socialism are higher than theinterests of the right of nations to self-determination. 
 Oursocialist republic has done all it could, and continues to do all it can to give effect to the right to self-determination of Finland, the Ukraine, etc. 
 But if the concrete situationis such that the existence of the socialist republic is beingimperilled at the present moment on account of the viola-tion of the right to self-determination of several nations(Poland, Lifland, Courland, etc. 
), naturally the preserva-tion of the socialist republic has the higher claim. 
 Consequently, whoever says, “We cannot sign a humiliat-ing, atrocious, etc. 
, peace, betray Poland, and so forth”,does not realise that by concluding peace on the conditionthat Poland is liberated, he would only be strengtheningGerman imperialism against Britain, Belgium, Serbia and other countries still further . 
 Peace on the condition of the liberation of Poland, Lifland and Courland would be a “pa-triotic” peace from the point of view of Russia , but would by no means cease to be a peace with the annexationists , with the German imperialists.

 The following should be added to the above theses: 22. 
 The mass strikes in Austria and Germany, and, subsequently, the formation of the Soviets of Workers’Deputies in Berlin and Vienna, and, lastly, beginning fromJanuary 18-20, armed clashes and street fighting in Berlin— all this should be regarded as evidence of the fact that the revolution in Germany has begun. 
 This fact offers us the opportunity, for the time being, of further delaying and dragging out the peace negotiations.

 Lenin Theses according to the manuscript AFTERWORD TO THE THESES ON THE QUESTION OF THE IMMEDIATE CONCLUSION OF A SEPARATE AND ANNEXATIONIST PEACE I read the above Theses to a small private meeting of Party functionaries on January 8, 1918. 
 The discussion onthem showed three opinions in the Party on this question—about a half those present spoke in favour of revolutionarywar (this was sometimes called the “Moscow” point of viewbecause the Moscow Regional Bureau of our Party adopted it earlier than other organisations); then about a quarter were for Comrade Trotsky who proposed to “declare the ces-sation of hostilities, demobilise the army, send the soldiershome but refrain from signing a treaty”, and, lastly, abouta quarter supported me. 
 The state of affairs now obtaining in the Party reminds me very strongly of the situation in the summer of 1907 when the overwhelming majority of the Bolsheviks favouredthe boycott of the Third Duma and I stood side by sidewith Dan in favour of participation and was subjected tofurious attacks for my opportunism. 
 Objectively, the pres-ent issue is a complete analogy; as then, the majority of the Party functionaries, proceeding from the very best revo-lutionary motives and the best Party traditions, allow them-selves to be carried away by a “flash” slogan and do not grasp the new socio-economic and political situation, do not take into consideration the change in the conditions that demands a speedy and abrupt change in tactics. 
 The essence of my argument, today as then, is to make clear that Marxism demands the consideration of objective conditions and theirchanges, that the question must be presented concretely as applicable to those conditions, that the most significant change that has occurred is the foundation of the Russian Soviet Republic, and the preservation of the republic that has already begun the socialist revolution is most importantto us and to the international socialist movement ; that at the moment the slogan of revolutionary war proclaimed byRussia would either be an empty phrase and an unsupporteddemonstration, or would be tantamount, objectively, to falling into the trap set for us by the imperialists, who wish to inveigle us into continuing the imperialist war while we are still a weak unit, so that the young Soviet Republicmight be crushed as cheaply as possible. 
 “I stand by Lenin’s old position,” exclaimed one young Muscovite (youth is one of the greatest virtues distinguish-ing that group of speakers) . 
 And that same speaker reproached me for repeating the old arguments of the defencistsabout the improbability of a revolution in Germany. 
 The whole trouble is that the Muscovites want to stick to the old tactical position, and stubbornly refuse to see the change that has taken place, the new objective situation that has arisen. 
 The Muscovites, in their zealous repetition of old slogans, have not even taken into consideration the fact that weBolsheviks have now all become defencists.

 Two months and fifteen days—that is only five days more than the preceding workers’ power lasted and ruled over a whole country, or over the exploiters and the capi-talists, the power of the Paris workers at the time of theParis Commune of 1871. 
 We must first of all remember this workers’ power, we must cast our minds back and compare it with the Sovietpower that was formed on October 25. 
 And if we compare the preceding dictatorship of the proletariat with the pres-ent one we shall see at once what a gigantic stride the inter-national working-class movement has made, and in whatan immeasurably more favourable position Soviet powerin Russia finds itself, notwithstanding the incredibly com-plicated conditions of war and economic ruin. 
 After retaining power for two months and ten days, the workers of Paris, who for the first time in history estab-lished the Commune, the embryo of Soviet power, perishedat the hands of the French Cadets, Mensheviks and RightSocialist-Revolutionaries of a Kaledin type. 
 The Frenchworkers had to pay an unprecedentedly heavy price for the first experience of workers’ government, the meaning and purpose of which the overwhelming majority of the peasantsin France did not know. 
 We find ourselves in immeasurably more favourable circumstances because the Russian soldiers, workers and peasants were able to create the Soviet Government, an apparatus which informed the whole world of their methodsof struggle. 
 It is this that puts the Russian workers andpeasants in a position that differs from the power of theParis proletariat. 
 They had no apparatus, the country didnot understand them; we were immediately able to rely on Soviet power, and that is why we never doubted that Soviet power enjoys the sympathy and the warmest and mostdevoted support of the overwhelming majority of the people,and that therefore Soviet power is invincible. 
 Those who were sceptical of Soviet power and frequently, either consciously or unconsciously, sold and betrayed it for compromise with the capitalists and the imperialists, raised a deafening clamour about the power of the proletar-iat alone not being able to be maintained in Russia. 
 As ifany Bolsheviks or their supporters forgot even for a momentthat in Russia only that power could last for any length oftime that would be able to unite the working class and the majority of the peasants, all the working and exploited classes, in a single, inseparably interconnected force fightingagainst the landowners and the bourgeoisie. 
 We never doubted that only the alliance of the workers and the poor peasants, the semi-proletarians, mentioned inour Party Programme, can, in Russia, embrace the majority of the population and ensure firm support for the govern-ment. 
 And after October 25 we were immediately able, inthe course of several weeks, to overcome all difficulties andestablish a government on the basis of this firm alliance. 
 Yes, comrades! When the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, in its old form—when the peasants did not yet understand who in this party were real advocates of socialism—put forward the slogan of equalitarian land tenure, withoutcaring who was to put it through, whether it was to beeffected in alliance with the bourgeoisie or not, we brandedthat as a fraud. 
 And this section, which has, now realised thatthe people are not with it and that it is a bubbler claimed that it could carry out equalitarian land tenure in alliance with the bourgeoisie. 
 In this lay the basic fraud. 
 And whenthe Russian revolution presented an example of collabora-tion between the working people and the bourgeoisie, in the greatest moment in the life of the people; when the war had been ruining the people and dooming millions to death from starvation and its consequences showed what compro-mise meant in practice; when the Soviets themselves expe-rienced it and felt it after having passed through the schoolof compromise, it became obvious that there was a sound,virile and great socialist core in the teachings of those who wanted to unite the working section of the peasants with the great socialist movement of the workers of the wholeworld. 
 And as soon as this became a clear and distinct practical question to the peasants, something happened of which noone had any doubt, as has now been proved by the Peasants’ Soviets and Congresses: when the time came to implement socialism, the peasants were able to see clearly these twomain political lines—alliance with the bourgeoisie, oralliance with the working people. 
 They then realised thatthe party which expressed the real aims and interests ofthe peasants was the Left Socialist-Revolutionary Party. 
 And when we concluded our government alliance with this party, we, from the very outset, arranged it so that thealliance rested on the clearest and most obvious principles. 
If the peasants of Russia want to socialise the land in alli-ance with the workers who will nationalise the banks andestablish workers’ control, then they are our loyal col-leagues, our most loyal and valuable allies. 
 Comrades, no so-cialist would refuse to admit the obvious truth that betweensocialism and capitalism there lies a long, more or lessdifficult transitional period of the dictatorship of the pro-letariat, and that the forms this period will take will bedetermined to a large extent by whether small or big owner-ship, small-or large-scale farming, predominates. 
 It goes without saying that the transition to socialism in Estland,that small country in which the whole population is literate,and which consists of large-scale farms, cannot be the sameas the transition to socialism in Russia, which is mainlya petty-bourgeois country. 
 This must be taken into account. 
 Every politically-conscious socialist says that socialism cannot be imposed upon the peasants by force and that wemust count only on the power of example and on the mass of the peasants assimilating day-to-day experience. 
 How would the peasants prefer to pass to socialism? This is the problem which now confronts the Russian peasants in practice. 
 How can they support the socialist proletariat and begin thetransition to socialism? The peasants have already tackledthis transition, and we have complete confidence in them. 
 The alliance we concluded with the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries is built on a firm basis and is growing stronger and stronger by the hour. 
 At first we on the Council of People’s Commissars feared that factional struggle wouldhinder the work, but now, after the experience of two months’work together, I must say definitely that on the majorityof questions we arrive at unanimous decisions. 
 We know that only when experience has shown the peas-ants, for example, the kind of exchange there must be between town and country they will themselves, from below,on the basis of their own experience, establish their ownconnections. 
 On the other hand, the experience of the CivilWar has demonstrated to the peasants that there is no otherroad to socialism except the dictatorship of the proletariat and the ruthless suppression of the rule of the exploiters. 
 (Applause. 
 ) Comrades, every time we touch upon this theme, at the present meeting, or in the Central Executive Committee, I,from time to time, hear from the Right side of the meetingthe exclamation “Dictator!” Yes, “when we were social-ists” everyone recognised the dictatorship of the proletar-iat; they even wrote about it in their programmes, theywere indignant at the widespread false idea that it waspossible to persuade and prove to the population that theworking people ought not to be exploited, that this wassinful and disgraceful, and that once people were persuaded of this there would be paradise on earth. 
 No, this utopian notion was smashed in theory long ago, and now our task isto smash it in practice. 
 We must not depict socialism as if socialists will bring it to us on a plate all nicely dressed. 
 That will never happen. 
Not a single problem of the class struggle has ever been solved in history except by violence. 
 When violence is exercised by the working people, by the mass of exploited against theexploiters—then we are for it! ( Stormy applause. 
 ) And we are not in the least disturbed by the howls of those people who consciously or unconsciously side with the bourgeoisie, or who are so frightened by them, so oppressed by their rule, that they have been flung into consternation at the sightof this unprecedentedly acute class struggle, have burst intotears, forgotten all their premises and demand that we per-form the impossible, that we socialists achieve completevictory without fighting against the exploiters and without suppressing their resistance. 
 As far back as the summer of 1917 the exploiters under-stood that it is a matter of “the last and decisive battles”,and that if the Soviets came to power the last bulwark ofthe bourgeoisie, their principal source for suppressing theworking people, would be torn out of their hands. 
 That is why the October Revolution began this systematic and unswerving struggle to compel the exploiters to ceasetheir resistance and to become reconciled to the idea, nomatter how difficult that may be for even the best of them, thatthe rule of the exploiting classes has gone never to return,that from now on the ordinary peasant will give the orders and that they must obey, however unpleasant that may be. 
 This will entail many difficulties, sacrifices and mis-takes; it is something new, unprecedented in history andcannot be studied from books. 
 It goes without saying thatthis is the greatest and most difficult transition that hasever occurred in history; but there is no other way to make this great transition and the fact that Soviet power has been established in Russia has shown that it is the revolu-tionary people who are richest of all in revolutionary experi-ence—when millions come to the assistance of a few scoreof Party people—the people who actually take their exploi-ters by the throat. 
 That is why civil war has acquired predominance in Rus-sia at the present time. 
 Against us is advanced the slogan:“Down with civil war!” I happened to hear this shouted fromthe Right benches of the so-called Constituent Assembly. 
Down with civil war .... 
 What does that mean? Civil war against whom? Against Kornilov, Kerensky and Ryabushinsky who are spending millions to bribe vagabonds and officials? Against the saboteurs who, consciously or unconsciously,are accepting these bribes? Undoubtedly, among the latter there are ignorant people who accept these bribes unconscious-ly, because they cannot even imagine that the old bour-geois system can and must be destroyed to the very foun-dation and that an entirely new, socialist society can andmust be built up on its ruins. 
 Undoubtedly there are peoplelike that, but does that alter the situation? That is why the representatives of the propertied classes are staking their all, that is why these are the last and decisive battles for them, and they would stop at no crime in their efforts to smash Soviet power. 
 Does not the wholehistory of socialism, particularly of French socialism,which is so rich in revolutionary striving, show us thatwhen the working people themselves take power in theirhands the ruling classes resort to unheard-of crimes and shootings if it is a matter of protecting their money-bags. 
 When these people talk to us about civil war we answerthem with ridicule; but when they spread their slogansamong the students we say—you are deceiving them! The class struggle did not accidentally assume its latest form, the form in which the exploited class takes all the means of power in its own hands in order to completely destroy its class enemy, the bourgeoisie, in order to sweepfrom the land of Russia not only the bureaucrats, but alsothe landowners, as the Russian peasants in several guber-nias have done. 
 We are told that the sabotage with which the bureau-crats and the landowners met the Council of People’s Com-missars is an indication of their unwillingness to assist social-ism, as if it were not clear that the whole of this gang ofcapitalists and swindlers, vagabonds and saboteurs, repre-sent a single gang bribed by the bourgeoisie and resistingthe power of the working people. 
 Of course, those who thought that it was possible to leap straight from capitalism to socialism, or those who imagined that it was possible toconvince the majority of the population that this couldbe achieved through the medium of the Constituent Assem-bly—those who believed in this bourgeois democratic fable,can go on blithely believing it, but let them not complain if life destroys this fable. 
 Those who have come to understand what the class struggle means, what the sabotage organised by the bureau-crats means, know that we cannot leap straight into social-ism. 
 There remained the bourgeoisie, capitalists, who hope to restore their rule and who defend their money-bags. 
 There remained vagabonds, a section of corrupt people who areabsolutely downtrodden by capitalism and who are unableto grasp the idea of the proletarian struggle. 
 There remainedoffice employees, bureaucrats who believe that it is in theinterests of society to protect the old system. 
 How can any-one imagine that the victory of socialism can come about except by the complete collapse of these sections, except bythe complete destruction of the Russian and European bour-geoisie? Do you think the Ryabushinskys do not under-stand their class interests? It is they who are paying thesaboteurs not to work. 
 Or do they operate disunited? Are they not operating in conjunction with the French, British and American capitalists by buying up securities? It remainsto be seen whether they will get much out of these trans-actions. 
 Will not the heaps of securities they are now buyingup turn out to be merely useless heaps of scrap-paper? That is why, comrades, our reply to all the reproaches and accusations hurled against us of employing terror, dictatorship, civil war, although we are far from havingresorted to real terror, because we are stronger than they—we have the Soviets, it will be sufficient if we nationalisethe banks and confiscate their property in order to compelthem to submit—our reply to all these charges of instigat-ing civil war is: yes, we have openly proclaimed what no other government has been able to proclaim. 
 The firstgovernment in the world that can speak openly of civilwar is the government of the workers, peasants and soldiers. 
Yes, we have started and we are waging civil war againstthe exploiters. 
 The more straightforwardly we say this, the more quickly will this war come to an end, the more quickly will all the working and exploited people under-stand us, will understand that Soviet power is fighting forthe real, vital cause of all the working people. 
 Comrades, I do not think we shall achieve victory in this struggle quickly, but we are very rich in experience: we have managed to achieve a great deal in the course of two months. 
 We have experienced Kerensky’s attempt tolaunch an attack against Soviet power and the complete failure of this attempt. 
 We have experienced the organisa-tion of power of the Ukrainian Kerenskys—the struggle has not yet ended there, but to anyone who has watched it, who has heard at least a few truthful reports from repre-sentatives of Soviet power, it is obvious that the bourgeoiselements of the Ukrainian Rada are living their last days. 
(Applause . 
) There cannot be the slightest doubt about the victory of Soviet power, of the Ukrainian People’s Repub-lic, over the Ukrainian bourgeois Rada. 
 As for the struggle against Kaledin—here, indeed, eve-rything rests on the basis of the exploitation of the workingpeople, on the basis of the bourgeois dictatorship—if thereis any social basis at all against Soviet power. 
 The Pea-sants’ Congress has clearly demonstrated that Kaledin’s cause is hopeless; the working people are against him. 
 The experience of Soviet power, propaganda by deeds, by theexample of the Soviet organisations, is having its effect,and Kaledin’s stronghold in the Don Region is now col-lapsing—not so much externally as internally. 
 That is why, looking at the civil war front in Russia, we can say with complete conviction: here the victory of Soviet power is complete and absolutely assured. 
 And,comrades, the victory of Soviet power is being achievedbecause right from the outset it began to realise the age-oldaspirations of socialism, while consistently and determined-ly relying on the people and considering it to be its duty to awaken the most oppressed and downtrodden sections of society to active life, to raise them to socialist creativework. 
 That is why the old army with its barrack-squaredrilling and torture of soldiers has retreated into the past. 
It has been thrown on the scrap-heap, nothing remainsof it. 
 ( Applause . 
) The complete democratisation of the army has been carried out. 
 Permit me to relate an incident that occurred when I was in the carriage of a Finnish train and I overheard aconversation between several Finns and an old woman. 
I could not take part in the conversation because I cannotspeak Finnish. 
 But one of the Finns turned to me and said: “Do you know the curious thing this old woman said? She said, ‘Now there is no need to fear the man with the gun. 
I was in the woods one day and I met a man with a gun, and instead of taking the firewood I had collected from me, he added some more. 
’” When I heard that, I said to myself: let the hundreds of newspapers, no matter what they call themselves—social-ist, near-socialist, etc. 
—let hundreds of extremely loudvoices shout at us, “dictators”, “violators”, and similarwords. 
 We know that another voice is now rising from amongthe people; they say to themselves: now we need not be afraid of the man with the gun because he protects the work-ing people and will be ruthless in suppressing the rule of theexploiters. 
 ( Applause . 
) This is what the people have felt, and that is why the propaganda that simple and uneducatedpeople are carrying on when they relate how the Red Guardsare turning their might against the exploiters—that propa-ganda is invincible. 
 It will spread among millions and tens of millions, and will firmly create what the FrenchCommune of the nineteenth century began to create, but wasable to continue for only a very short time because it waswrecked by the bourgeoisie—it will create a socialist RedArmy, something all socialists have always aimed at, i. 
e. 
, the general arming of the people. 
 It will create new Red Guard cadres that will enable us to train the working peoplefor the armed struggle. 
 It used to be said about Russia that she would be unable to fight because she would have no officers. 
 But we must notforget what these very bourgeois officers said as they ob-served the workers fighting against Kerensky and Kaledin. 
 They said: “The Red Guards’ technical level is very low,but if these people had a little training they would have aninvincible army. 
” This is because, for the first time inthe history of the world struggle, elements have entered thearmy which are not the vehicles of bureaucratic knowledge, but are guided by the idea of the struggle to emancipate the exploited. 
 And when the work we have commencedis completed, the Russian Soviet Republic will be invin-cible. 
 ( Applause . 
) Comrades, the road which Soviet power has traversed insofar as concerns the socialist army has also been trav-ersed insofar as concerns another instrument of the ruling classes, an even more subtle, an even more complicatedinstrument—the bourgeois court, which claimed to maintain order, but which, as a matter of fact, was a blind, subtle instrument for the ruthless suppression of the exploited, and an instrument for protecting the interests of the money-bags. 
 Soviet power acted in the way all the proletarianrevolutions had shown that it must act; it immediatelythrew the old court on to the scrap-heap. 
 Let them shoutthat we, without reforming the old court, immediatelythrew it on to the scrap-heap. 
 By that we paved the way for a real people’s court, and not so much by the force of repressive measures as by massive example, the authorityof the working people, without formalities; we transformedthe court from an instrument of exploitation into an instru-ment of education on the firm foundations of socialist so-ciety. 
 There is no doubt whatever that we cannot attain such a society at once. 
 These, then, are the main steps Soviet power has taken along the road indicated by the experience of the greatpopular revolutions throughout the world. 
 There has notbeen a single revolution in which the working people did notbegin to take some steps along this road in order to set up a new state power. 
 Unfortunately, they only began to do this, but were unable to finish, they were unable to create thenew type of state power. 
 We have created it—we havealready established a socialist Republic of Soviets. 
 I have no illusions about our having only just entered the period of transition to socialism, about not yet having reached socialism. 
 But if you say that our state is a social-ist Republic of Soviets, you will be right. 
 You will beas right as those who call many Western bourgeois repub-lics democratic republics although everybody knows thatnot one of even the most democratic of these republicsis completely democratic. 
 They grant scraps of democracy, they cut off tiny bits of the rights of the exploiters, but the working people are as much oppressed there as theyare everywhere else. 
 Nevertheless, we say that the bour-geois system is represented by both old monarchies andby constitutional republics. 
 And so in our case now. 
 We are far from having com-pleted even the transitional period from capitalism to socialism. 
 We have never cherished the hope that we couldfinish it without the aid of the international proletariat. 
 We never had any illusions on that score, and we know how difficult is the road that leads from capitalism to socialism. 
 But it is our duty to say that our Soviet Republic is a socialist republic because we have taken this road, and ourwords will not be empty words. 
 We have initiated many measures undermining the ca-pitalists’ rule. 
 We know that our power had to unite theactivities of all our institutions by a single principle, and this principle we express in the words: “Russia is declared to be a Socialist Republic of Soviets. 
” ( Applause . 
) This will be that truth which rests on what we must do andhave already begun to do, this will be the best unificationof all our activities, the proclamation of our programme, acall to the working people and the exploited of all coun-tries who either do not know at all what socialism is, or, what is worse, believe that socialism is the Chernov-Tsereteli mess of bourgeois reforms which we have tasted andtried during the ten months of the revolution and which wehave become convinced is a falsification and not socialism. 
 And that is why “free” Britain and France did all they could during the ten months of our revolution to prevent a single copy of Bolshevik and Left Socialist-Revolutionarynewspapers from entering their countries. 
 They had to actin this way because they saw that the workers and peasantsin all countries instinctively grasped what the Russianworkers were doing. 
 There was not a single meeting where news about the Russian revolution and the slogan of Soviet power was not hailed with stormy applause. 
 The workingpeople and the exploited everywhere have already come intoconflict with their party top leadership. 
 The old socialismof these leaders is not yet buried like that of Chkheidze andTsereteli in Russia, but it is already done for in all countries of the world, it is already dead. 
 A new state—the Republic of Soviets, the republic of the working people, of the exploited classes that are break-ing down the old bourgeois barriers, now stands againstthe old bourgeois system. 
 New state forms have been creat-ed, which make it possible to suppress the exploiters, to overcome the resistance of this insignificant handful who are still strong because of yesterday’s money-bags andyesterday’s store of knowledge. 
 They—the professors, teachers and engineers—transform their knowledge into an instrument for the exploitation of the working people, saying they want their knowledge to serve the bourgeoisie, otherwise they refuse to work. 
 But their power has beenbroken by the workers’ and peasants’ revolution, and astate is rising against them in which the people themselvesfreely elect their own representatives. 
 It is precisely at the present time that we can say that we really have an organisation of power which clearly indicates the transition to the complete abolition of anypower, of any state. 
 This will be possible when every traceof exploitation has been abolished, that is, in socialist so-ciety. 
 Now I shall deal briefly with the measures which the socialist Soviet Government of Russia has begun to realise. 
 The nationalisation of the banks was one of the first meas-ures adopted for the purpose, net only of wiping the land-owners from the face of Russian earth, but also of eradi-cating the rule of the bourgeoisie and the possibility ofcapital oppressing millions and tens of millions of the work-ing people. 
 The banks are important centres of modern capitalist economy. 
 They collect fantastic wealth anddistribute it over this vast country; they are the nervecentres of capitalist life. 
 They are subtle and intricateorganisations, which grew up in the course of centuries;and against them were hurled the first blows of Soviet power which at first encountered desperate resistance in the State Bank. 
 But this resistance did not deter Soviet power. 
We succeeded in the main thing in organising the StateBank; this main thing is in the hands of the workers andpeasants. 
 After these basic measures, which still require alot of working out in detail, we proceeded to lay our hands on the private banks. 
 We did not act in the way the compromisers would prob-ably have recommended us to do, i. 
e. 
, first wait until theConstituent Assembly is convened, then perhaps draft a billand introduce it in the Constituent Assembly and by thatinform the bourgeoisie of our intentions and enable them to find a loophole through which to extricate themselves from this unpleasant thing; perhaps draw them into our company,and then make state laws—that would be a “state act”. 
 That would be the rejection of socialism. 
 We acted quite simply; not fearing to call forth the reproaches of the “edu-cated” people, or rather of the uneducated supporters of the bourgeoisie who were trading in the remnants of theirknowledge, we said we had at our disposal armed work-ers and peasants. 
 This morning they must occupy all theprivate banks. 
 ( Applause . 
) After they have done that, after power is in our hands, only after this, we shall discuss what measures to adopt. 
 In the morning the banks were occupied and in the evening the Central Executive Committee issueda decree: “The banks are declared national property”—state control, the socialisation of banking, its transfer toSoviet power, took place. 
 There was not a man among us who could imagine that an intricate and subtle apparatus like banking, which grew out of the capitalist system of economy in the course ofcenturies, could be broken or transformed in a few days. 
We never said that. 
 And when scientists, or pseudo-scientists,shook their heads and prophesied, we said: you can proph-esy what you like. 
 We know only one way for the proletar-ian revolution, namely, to occupy the enemy’s positions— to learn to rule by experience, from our mistakes. 
 We do notin the least belittle the difficulties in our path, but wehave done the main thing. 
 The source of capitalist wealthhas been undermined in the place of its distribution. 
 Afterall this, the repudiation of the state loans, the overthrow of the financial yoke, was a very easy step. 
 The transition to confiscation of the factories, after workers’ control hadbeen introduced, was also very easy. 
 When we were accusedof breaking up production into separate departments byintroducing workers’ control, we brushed aside this nonsense. 
In introducing workers’ control, we knew that it would take much time before it spread to the whole of Russia, but we wanted to show that we recognise only one road—changesfrom below; we wanted the workers themselves, from below,to draw up the new, basic economic principles. 
 Much timewill be required for this. 
 From workers’ control we passed on to the creation of a Supreme Economic Council. 
 Only this measure, together with the nationalisation of the banks and railways whichwill be carried out within the next few days, will make it possible for us to begin work to build up a new socialist economy. 
 We know perfectly well the difficulties that confront us in this work; but we assert that only those who set to work to carry out this task relying on the experienceand the instinct of the working people are socialists in deed. 
The people will commit many mistakes, but the main thinghas been done. 
 They know that when they appeal to Sovietpower they will get whole-hearted support against the ex-ploiters. 
 There is not a single measure intended to ease their work that was not entirely supported by Soviet power. 
 So-viet power does not know everything and cannot handleeverything in time, and very often it is confronted withdifficult tasks. 
 Very often delegations of workers and peas-ants come to the government and ask, for example, what to do with such-and-such a piece of land. 
 And frequently I myself have felt embarrassed when I saw that they had novery definite views. 
 And I said to them: you are the power,do all you want to do, take all you want, we shall supportyou, but take care of production, see that production isuseful. 
 Take up useful work, you will make mistakes, but you will learn. 
 And the workers have already begun to learn; they have already begun to fight against the sabo-teurs. 
 Education has been turned into a fence which hindersthe advance of the working classes; it will be pulleddown. 
 Undoubtedly, the war is corrupting people both in the rear and at the front; people who are working on war sup-plies are paid far above the rates, and this attracts all thosewho hid themselves to keep out of the war, the vagabondand semi-vagabond elements who are imbued with one de-sire, to “grab” something and clear out. 
 But these elementsare the worst that has remained of the old capitalist system and are the vehicles of all the old evils; these we must kick out, remove, and we must put in the factories all thebest proletarian elements and form them into nuclei of fu-ture socialist Russia. 
 This is not an easy task, it will giverise to many conflicts, to much friction and many clashes. 
We, the Council of People’s Commissars, and I personally, have heard complaints and threats from them, but we have remained calm, knowing that now we have a judge to whomwe can appeal. 
 That judge is the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies. 
 ( Applause . 
) The word of this judge is indisputable, and we shall always rely upon it. 
 Capitalism deliberately differentiates the workers in order to rally an insignificant handful of the upper section of theworking class around the bourgeoisie. 
 Conflicts with thissection are inevitable. 
 We shall not achieve socialism with-out a struggle. 
 But we are ready to fight, we have startedit and we shall finish it with the aid of the apparatus called the Soviets. 
 The Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies will easily solve any problem we bring before it. 
 For howeverstrong the group of privileged workers may be, when theyare brought before the representative body of all the work-ers, then this court, I repeat, will be indisputable forthem. 
 This sort of adjustment is only just beginning. 
 The workers and peasants have not yet sufficient confidence in their own strength; age-old tradition has made them far tooused to waiting for orders from above. 
 They have not yetfully appreciated the fact that the proletariat is the rulingclass; there are still elements among them who are fright-ened and downtrodden and who imagine that they must pass through the despicable school of the bourgeoisie. 
 This most despicable of bourgeois notions has remainedalive longer than all the rest, but it is dying and will dieout completely. 
 And we are convinced that with every stepSoviet power takes the number of people will constantlygrow who have completely thrown off the old bourgeois notion that a simple worker and peasant cannot administer the state. 
 Well, if he sets to doing it, he can and will learn!(Applause . 
) And it will be our organisational task to select leaders and organisers from among the people. 
 This enormous,gigantic work is now on the agenda There could even be no thought of carrying it out if it were not for Soviet power, a filtering apparatus which can promote people. 
 Not only have we a state law on control, we have some-thing even far more valuable—attempts on the part of theproletariat to enter into agreements with the manufacturers’associations in order to guarantee the workers’ management over whole branches of industry. 
 Such an agreement has begun to be drawn up, and is almost completed, betweenthe leather workers and the all-Russia leather manufactur-ers’ society. 
 I attach very special importance to these agreements,163 they show that the workers are becoming aware of their strength. 
 Comrades, in my report I have not dealt with the partic-ularly painful and difficult questions of peace and the foodsupply, because they are special items on the agenda andwill be discussed separately. 
 My purpose in making this brief report was to show, as it appears to me and to the whole of the Council of People’s Commissars, the entire history of what we have experiencedduring the past two and a half months, how the relation ofclass forces took shape in this new period of the Russianrevolution, how a new state power was formed and whatsocial tasks confront it. 
 Russia has started to achieve socialism in the right way— by the nationalisation of the banks and the transfer of allthe land entirely to the working people. 
 We are well awareof the difficulties that lie ahead, but we are convinced, bycomparing our revolution with previous revolutions, thatwe shall achieve enormous successes and that we are on the road that guarantees complete victory. 
 And with us will go the masses of the more advanced countries, countries which have been divided by a predatorywar, whose workers have passed through a longer period oftraining in democracy. 
 When people depict the difficultiesof our task, when we are told that the victory of socialism is possible only on a world scale, we regard this merely as an attempt, a particularly hopeless attempt, on the partof the bourgeoisie and of its voluntary and involuntarysupporters to distort the irrefutable truth. 
 The final victoryof socialism in a single country is of course impossible. 
 Ourcontingent of workers and peasants which is upholding So-viet power is one of the contingents of the great world army, which at present has been split by the world war, but whichis striving for unity, and every piece of information, everyfragment of a report about our revolution, every name, theproletariat greets with loud and sympathetic cheers, becauseit knows that in Russia the common cause is being pursued, the cause of the proletariat’s uprising, the international socialist revolution. 
 A living example, tackling the jobsomewhere in one country is more effective than any procla-mations and conferences; this is what inspires the working people in all countries. 
 The October strike in 1905—the first steps of the victori-ous revolution—immediately spread to Western Europe andthen, in 1905, called forth the movement of the Austrianworkers; already at that time we had a practical illustrationof the value of the example of revolution, of the action bythe workers in one country, and today we see that the social-ist revolution is maturing by the hour in all countries of the world. 
 If we make mistakes and blunders and meet with obstacles on our way, that is not what is important to them; whatis important to them is our example, that is what unitesthem. 
 They say: we shall go together and conquer, come what may. 
 ( Applause . 
) The great founders of socialism, Marx and Engels, having watched the development of the labour movement andthe growth of the world socialist revolution for a number ofdecades saw clearly that the transition from capitalism tosocialism would require prolonged birth-pangs, a long period of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the break-up of all that belonged to the past, the ruthless destruction of allforms of capitalism, the co-operation of the workers ofall countries, who would have to combine their efforts toensure complete victory. 
 And they said that at the end ofthe nineteenth century “the Frenchman will begin it, and the German will finish it” 164—the Frenchman would begin it because in the course of decades of revolution he hadacquired that intrepid initiative in revolutionary actionthat made him the vanguard of the socialist revolution. 
 Today we see a different combination of international socialist forces. 
 We say that it is easier for the movement to start in the countries that are not among those exploiting countries which have opportunities for easy plunder andare able to bribe the upper section of their workers. 
 Thepseudo-socialist, nearly all ministerial, Chernov-Tsereteliparties of Western Europe do not accomplish anything, andthey lack firm foundations. 
 We have seen the example of Italy; during the past few days we witnessed the heroic struggle of the Austrian workers against the predatory im-perialists. 
 165 Though the pirates may succeed in holding up the movement for a time, they cannot stop it altogether, it is invincible. 
 The example of the Soviet Republic will stand before them for a long time to come. 
 Our socialist Republic ofSoviets will stand secure, as a torch of international social-ism and as an example to all the working people. 
 Overthere—conflict, war, bloodshed, the sacrifice of millions ofpeople, capitalist exploitation; here—a genuine policy of peace and a socialist Republic of Soviets. 
 Things have turned out differently from what Marx and Engels expected and we, the Russian working and exploitedclasses, have the honour of being the vanguard of the inter-national socialist revolution; we can now see clearly howfar the development of the revolution will go. 
 The Russian began it—the German, the Frenchman and the Englishman will finish it, and socialism will be victorious. 
 ( Applause . 
) 2 CONCLUDING SPEECH ON THE REPORT OF THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE’S COMMISSARS JANUARY 12 (25) Having listened today to the speakers on the Right, who voiced objections to my report, I am surprised that they have not yet learned anything and have forgotten all thatthey in vain call “Marxism”. 
 One of the objectors declaredthat we had favoured the dictatorship of democracy, that wehad recognised the rule of democracy. 
 That declarationwas so absurd, so utterly meaningless, that it is merely a collection of words. 
 It was just like saying “iron snow”, or something similar. 
 ( Laughter . 
) Democracy is a form of bourgeois state championed by all traitors to genuine so-cialism, who now find themselves at the head of officialsocialism and who assert that democracy is contrary to thedictatorship of the proletariat. 
 Until the revolution tran-scended the limits of the bourgeois system, we were for de-mocracy; but as soon as we saw the first signs of socialismin the progress of the revolution, we took a firm and resolutestand for the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
 It is strange that people who cannot or refuse to under-stand this plain truth, this definition of the meaning of the terms “democracy” and “dictatorship of the proletariat”, should make bold to bring before so numerous an assemblyold, utterly worthless rubbish, such as that in which all theobjecting gentlemen’s speeches abound. 
 Democracy is formalparliamentarism, but in reality it is a continuous, cruelmockery, heartless, unbearable oppression of the working people by the bourgeoisie. 
 And this can only be denied by those who are not true spokesmen for the working class butwretched men in mufflers who have kept away from life all the time, who have been sleeping with an old, shabby little book carefully stowed away under the pillow, the unwanted book that serves them as a guide and manual in implanting official socialism. 
 But the minds of tens of millions of thosewho are doing things create something infinitely loftierthan the greatest genius can foresee. 
 Genuine, revolutionarysocialism did not break away today but at the beginning ofthe war. 
 This significant break, this rift in socialist theory, has come about in every country and every state. 
 And it is splendid that socialism has split! We can counter the accusation that we are fighting against “socialists” by saying merely that in the epoch of parliamen-tarism these supporters of the latter no longer have anythingin common with socialism but have become decayed, obso-lete and backward, and have ended by deserting to the bour-geoisie. 
 “Socialists” who shouted about “defending thecountry” during a war resulting from the imperialist urge ofinternational robbers are not socialists but hangers-on ofthe bourgeoisie, their dish-lickers. 
 Those who talk so much about the dictatorship of democ-racy merely utter meaningless, absurd phrases which indi-cate neither economic knowledge nor political understand-ing. 
 One of the objectors said here that the Paris Commune can be proud of the fact that during the Paris workers’ uprisingthere was no violence or arbitrary action on their part; but it is beyond doubt that the Commune fell only because it did not make proper use of armed force at the right moment,although it won undying fame in history, for it was thefirst to put the idea of the dictatorship of the proletariat intopractice. 
 Commenting briefly on the struggle against the bourgeoi-sie, landowners and capitalists, the speaker declared firmly and resolutely, amidst a burst of applause: “Say what youmay, the bourgeoisie will in the end be forced by the willof the revolutionary people either to capitulate, or toperish. 
” Drawing a parallel between anarchism and Bolshevik views, Comrade Lenin said that at that time, in the period of a radical break-up of the bourgeois system, the conceptof anarchism was finally assuming concrete features. 
 But if the oppression of the bourgeois system was to be abol-ished, there would have to be firm revolutionary power of the working classes, the power of a revolutionary state. 
 This was the essence of communism. 
 When the masses werethemselves taking up arms to start an unrelenting struggleagainst the exploiters, when a new people’s power was beingapplied that had nothing in common with parliamentary pow-er, it was no longer the old state, outdated in its traditions and forms, that they had before them, but something new, something based on the creative power of the people. 
 And whilesome anarchists spoke of the Soviets with fear because theywere still influenced by obsolete views, the new, fresh trendin anarchism was definitely on the side of the Soviets, be-cause it saw their vitality and their ability to win the sym-pathy of the working masses and arouse their creative energy. 
 “Your sin and blindness,” said the speaker, turning to the “objectors”, “are due to your failure to learn anything fromthe revolution. 
 As early as April 4, I affirmed, speaking inthis hall, that the Soviets are the highest form of democra-cy. 
 * Either the Soviets will perish and then the revolution will be irrevocably lost, or the Soviets will live and then itwill be ridiculous to talk of a bourgeois-democratic revolu-tion at a time when the socialist system is on the way to itsfull development and capitalism is collapsing. 
 The Bolshe-viks spoke of a bourgeois-democratic revolution in 1905, but today, when the Soviets are in power, when the workers, soldiers and peasants have said—in a war situation unprec-edented for hardships and horrors, in an atmosphere ofruin, and in the face of death by starvation—that they willassume full power and will themselves set about building anew life, there can be no question of a bourgeois-democratic revolution. 
 And the Bolsheviks said as much at their con-gresses and meetings and conferences, and in their resolu-tions and decisions, as early as last April. 
 “To those who say that we have done nothing, that we have been inactive all the time, that Soviet rule has borneno fruits, we can say this: Look wherever there are working people, look among the masses, and you will see organisa-*See present edition, Vol.

 tional, creative work in full swing, you will see the stir of a life that is being renewed and hallowed by the revolution. 
 The peasants are taking over the land in the countryside, the workers are seizing the factories, and all kinds of or-ganisations are springing up everywhere. 
 “Soviet power is striving to bring the war to an end, and we are confident that it will achieve this goal earlier thanKerensky government spokesmen have promised. 
 For the revolution has become a factor in the matter of ending the war, a factor which has denounced treaties and repudiatedloans. 
 The war will come to an end due to the internationalrevolutionary movement. 
” In conclusion, the speaker commented in a few words on counter-revolutionary saboteurs, saying that they were groups bribed by the bourgeoisie, which showered its gifts on the sabotaging officials who declared war on the Sovietstate, for the triumph of reaction. 
 To them it was doomsday,the irrevocable end of everything when they saw the peoplestriking vigorously at the bourgeoisie with a peasants’ andworkers’ axe. 
 “Our only fault, if any, is that we were much too humane, much too kind-hearted, towards the monstrous-ly treacherous representatives of the bourgeois-imperialistsystem. 
 “A few days ago some Novaya Zhizn writers visited me, saying they had come on behalf of bank employees who want-ed to take up service and submit fully to Soviet power, stopping the policy of sabotage. 
 High time, I answered. 
 * But, speaking confidentially, if they imagine that having begun those talks, we shall cede our revolutionary positionsone iota, they are sorely mistaken. 
 “The world has never seen anything like that which is now taking place here in Russia, in this vast country broken up into a number of separate states and containing an enor-mous number of heterogeneous nationalities and peoples. 
I refer to the immense organisational work in every uyezdand region, the organisation of the lower strata, the workof the masses themselves, the creative, constructive activity,which encounters obstacles raised by various bourgeois representatives of imperialism. 
 They, the workers and *See p.

 peasants, are engaged in an effort unprecedented in its titanic aims; together with the Soviets, they will smash capitalist exploitation, and bourgeois oppression will in the end be abolished once and for all. 
” 3 DRAFT DECREE ON EXPUNGING REFERENCES TO THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY SOVIET LEGISLATION DECREE A number of laws, decrees and decisions taken by the Soviet Government contain references to the Constituent Assembly and its legislative character. 
 All these references naturally become irrelevant and lapse with the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly by theCentral Executive Committee and the approval of this stepby the Third All-Russia Congress of Soviets. 
 Accordingly, the Third All-Russia Congress of Soviets resolves: any references to the forthcoming Constituent Assembly shall be expunged from all new editions of decreesand laws of the Soviet Government. 
 Written on January 18 (31), 1918 4 SUMMING -UP SPEECH AT THE CONGRESS JANUARY 18 (31) Comrades, before the Third Congress of Soviets closes we must establish with complete impartiality the momentous part it has had to play in the history of the international revolution and of mankind. 
 There are incontestable groundsfor saying that the Third Congress of Soviets has opened anew epoch in world history and there is growing awareness ofits significance in these times of world revolution. 
 It hasconsolidated the organisation of the new state power which was created by the October Revolution and has projected the lines of future socialist construction for the whole world,for the working people of all countries. 
 The new system of the socialist Soviet Republic, as a fed-eration of free republics of the different nations inhabitingRussia, has been finally accepted in this country in the sphere of domestic politics. 
 It is now clear to all, and even to our enemies, I daresay, that the new system, the Sovietpower, is not an invention or a party trick, but is the resultof the development of life itself, the outcome of the worldrevolution as it spontaneously takes shape. 
 You will recallthat all great revolutions invariably strove to raze the old capitalist system to the ground; they strove not only to win political rights but also to wrest the very reins of govern-ment from the hands of the ruling classes, and all the exploi-ters and oppressors of the working people, so as to put anend to all exploitation and all oppression for good. 
 Greatrevolutions strove to demolish this old exploiting state ma-chine but had not managed to bring it off until now. 
 And now Russia, in virtue of the peculiarities of her economicand political position, has first achieved this transfer of /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR government powers into the hands of the working people. 
 We shall now proceed to build, on the space cleared of his-torical rubbish, the airy towering edifice of the socialist society. 
 A new type of state power is being created for thefirst time in history, a power that the will of the revolutionhas called upon to wipe out all exploitation, oppression andslavery the world over. 
 Let us take a look at what the new socialist principle of government has yielded in the sphere of our domestic policy. 
 Comrades, you will recall that just recently thebourgeois press was vociferously accusing us of destroyingthe Russian state and saying that we were incapable ofrunning the country, and so all the nationalities—Finland,the Ukraine, etc. 
—were leaving us. 
 The bourgeois press, transported with malicious joy, carried almost daily reports of such “secessions”. 
 We. 
 comrades, had a better understand-ing than they of the main causes of this phenomenon whichwere rooted in the working people’s mistrust of the concili-atory imperialist government of Kerensky and Co. 
 We keptsilent, being quite sure that our just principles and our government would demonstrate our true purposes and aspi-rations to all the working people better than words. 
 We proved to be right. 
 We see now that our ideas have won out in Finland and the Ukraine and are winning outon the Don, that they are awakening the working people’sclass-consciousness and are organising them into a solid alliance. 
 We acted without any diplomatists or the use of the old imperialist methods, but can point to the greatestresult: the revolution has won, and those who have won areallied with us in a mighty revolutionary federation. 
 We donot rule by dividing, as ancient Rome’s harsh maxim requi-red, but by uniting all the working people with the unbreak-able bonds of living interests and a sense of class. 
 This our union, our new state is sounder than power based on vio-lence which keeps artificial state entities hammered togetherwith lies and bayonets in the way the imperialists wantthem. 
 Thus, no sooner had the Finnish workers and peasantstaken power than they sent us their expressions of loyalty to the world proletarian revolution and greetings which re-veal unflinching determination to march with us along thepath of the International. 
 166 There is the basis of our federa-tion and I am profoundly convinced that more and more diverse federations of free nations will group themselves around revolutionary Russia. 
 This federation is invincible and will grow quite freely, without the help of lies or bay-onets. 
 The laws and the state system which we are creatingover here are the best earnest of its invincibility. 
 You havejust heard a reading of the law on the socialisation ofland. 
 167 Isn’t it a pledge of the unbreakable unity of the workers and peasants, isn’t it a guarantee that in this unity we shall be able to overcome all obstacles on the way tosocialism? I must tell you that these obstacles are tremendous. 
 You can depend on the bourgeoisie to resort to every trick,to stake their all on crushing our unity. 
 They can be expect-ed to make use of liars, provocateurs, traitors, possibly, dupes, but henceforth we have nothing to fear, because wehave established our own new state power and because wehold the reins of government. 
 We shall throw the full weightof our power against any counter-revolutionary attempt. 
But the chief pillar of the new system is the organisational measures we shall be implementing for the sake of social-ism. 
 In this respect we are faced with a vast amount ofwork. 
 You must bear in mind, comrades, that the imperial-ists, the world’s brigands, who had embroiled the nationsin war, have disrupted the economic life of the world to itsvery roots. 
 They have left us an onerous legacy, the work to restore what they had destroyed. 
 Of course, the working people had no experience in go-vernment but that does not scare us. 
 The victorious prole-tariat looks out on a land that has now become a publicgood, and it will be quite able to organise the new productionand consumption on socialist lines. 
 In the old days, human genius, the brain of man, created only to give some the benefits of technology and culture, and to deprive others ofthe bare necessities, education and development. 
 From nowon all the marvels of science and the gains of culture belongto the nation as a whole, and never again will man’s brainand human genius be used for oppression and exploitation. 
 Of this we are sure, so shall we not dedicate ourselves and work with abandon to fulfil this greatest of all historicaltasks? The working people will perform this titanic historical feat, for in them lie dormant the great forces of revolution, renascence and renovation. 
 We are no longer alone. 
 In the last few days, momentous events have taken place not only in the Ukraine and theDon area, not only in the realm of our Kaledins and Keren-skys, but in Western Europe as well. 
 You have already heardof the telegrams on the state of the revolution in Germany. 
The flames of a revolutionary wildfire are leaping higher and higher over the whole of this rotten old world system. 
 It was no pie-in-the-sky theory, no armchair pipe dream thatonce we had established Soviet power we would induce othersto make similar attempts in other countries. 
 For I must re-peat that the working people had no other way out of theslaughter. 
 These attempts are now being consolidated as gains of the international revolution. 
 We close this historic Congress of Soviets under the sign of the mounting worldrevolution, and the time is not far off when the workingpeople of all countries will unite into a single world-widestate and join in a common effort to build a new socialistedifice. 
 The way to this construction runs through the Sov-iets, as a form of the incipient world revolution. 
 ( Stormy applause. 
 ) In greeting you I urge you to build this new edifice. 
 You will return to your various places and will bend every effortto organise and consolidate our great victory. 
 ( The delegates rise and greet Comrade Lenin with stormy applause.

 Ulyanov (Lenin ), Chairman of the Council of People’s Commissars First published in 1931 Published according in Lenin Miscellany XVIII to the manuscript EXTRAORDINAR Y ALL-RUSSI A RAILWAYME N’S CONGRESS JANUAR Y 5-30 (JANUAR Y 18-FEBRUAR Y 12), 1918168 1 REPORT OF THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE’S COMMISSARS JANUARY 13 (26) Comrades, I am unfortunately unable to report on all points and hope that those of you who take a closer interest in the state of affairs have got a full and accurate pictureof the present p(,sition of Soviet power, its attitude to other institutions and the tasks now facing it, partly from newspaper reports and partly from personal impressions atthe Congress of Soviets. 
 Allow me, therefore, to confinemyself to a few brief additional remarks. 
 In order to char-acterise the tasks and position of Soviet power, I must tellyou of its attitude to the organisation of the railway prole-tariat, the railway workers. 
 Comrades, you are aware that Soviet power clashed with the Constituent Assembly and that all the propertied classes —the landowners, the bourgeoisie, the Kaledinites andtheir supporters—are now berating us for having dissolvedit. 
 But the louder these complaints in the few bourgeois papers, the louder is the voice of the workers, the soldiers, the working and exploited people. 
 The peasants say thatthey have never doubted that Soviet power was head andshoulders above any other power, and that the workers,soldiers and peasants would never let any institution takeover from their own Soviets, which they had elected, and set up and which they control and verify. 
 You are well aware that Soviet power clashed with the Constituent Assemblymainly because it had been elected on lists drawn up before the October Revolution. 
 The Constituent Assembly was elect-ed on the basis of proportional representation through uni-versal, direct and equal suffrage by secret ballot. 
 That is the most perfect electoral system but it can be a correctexpression of the people’s will only on one condition, name-ly, that the parties which under that system alone have theright and possibility of drawing up electoral lists are trulyrepresentative of the mood, the wishes, the interests and the will of the groups of population electing them, because under another electoral system, when individual candidatesor deputies are each elected by a separate district, the people,depending on their mood or any political changes, can veryeasily correct their mistakes. 
 Under the system of proportion-al representation, the lists had to be drawn up by each party as a whole long before the elections actually took place; this explains how it came about that the parties had todraw up their lists back in September and early October fora Constituent Assembly that was to have met on November12. 
 You all remember that there was a statutory period withinwhich all the parties had to submit their lists, and that no changes were allowed after that. 
 That is how it came about that Russia’s biggest party—the one that was undoubtedlythe biggest that summer and autumn, the Socialist-Revolu-tionary Party—had to present its lists by the beginning ofOctober 1917 on behalf of the whole Socialist-Revolution-ary Party. 
 That is what actually took place. 
 The lists of candidates were presented in early October, including that of the Socialigt-Revolutionary Party, as if such a partycontinued to exist as an entity. 
 It turned out that the con-ciliation with Kerensky came to an end after the list hadbeen drawn up, after the Russian workers and peasants hadtravelled a long, hard and strenuous way in setting up their Soviets. 
 After all, Kerensky was also regarded as a Social-ist-Revolutionary—he was believed to be both a socialistand a revolutionary—although in actual fact he was an im-perialist who hid in his pocket secret treaties with the Frenchand British imperialists, the very same treaties that hadbeen concluded by the tsar, who was deposed in February, the very game treatieg which doomed the Russian people to participation in the bloodbath over whether or not theRussian capitalists would seize Constantinople, the Darda-nelles and Armenia or a piece of Galicia; some who really let themselves go, like the famous Milyukov, made maps, well in advance, showing the strip of Eastern Prussia which was to be the Russian people’s own reward for the bloodshed by millions of its workers and soldiers. 
 There you havea true picture of the dominant Russian bourgeois-imperialistrepublic of Kerensky, who continued to be regarded as,and in fact was, a member of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party. 
 The Second All-Russia Congress of Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies met in late October, by which timethe people were fed up with placating the imperialists, andthe June offensive had cost us hundreds of thousands oflives, and had clearly shown why the war was dragging on, how these secret treaties doomed the soldiers to the slaught-er, and why talk of peace remained nothing but talk. 
That was why the Second All-Russia Congress of Sovietsoverthrew the rule of the bourgeois-imperialist governmentand established Soviet power. 
 The elections to the Con-stituent Assembly fell on November 12 and confronted the workers, soldiers and especially the peasants with a situa-tion in which they had to vote on the old lists, becausethere were no others, and none could be drawn up. 
 So whenwe are now told, “You have dissolved the ConstituentAssembly which represents the majority of the people”,when this is chorused by bourgeois penpushers and news-papers of the Kerensky-socialist stamp, we respond: “Why is it that you cannot make a single straightforward statement tothe people about the argument which I have just set forthand which was contained in the decree dissolving the Constit-uent Assembly?” We cannot consider the ConstituentAssembly to be expressive of the people’s will because it was elected on old lists. 
 The workers and especially the peasants voted for the Socialist-Revolutionaries as a whole party,but it split after the elections, and appeared before thepeople as two parties: the Right-wingers, who sided withthe bourgeoisie, and the party of the Left Socialist-Revolu-tionaries, who sided with the working class and the working people, and came down on the side of socialism. 
 Did the people have any chance to choose between the Right andLeft Socialist-Revolutionaries under the Constituent As-sembly? No, they did not, and so we say that, even from this formal standpoint of the lists and the election, no one can refute our assertion that the Constituent Assembly was unable to give a correct expression to the people’swill. 
 The revolution is not to blame for having come afterthe lists had been drawn up and before the elections to theConstituent Assembly had been held; the revolution is notto blame that the Socialist-Revolutionary Party had kept the people, especially the peasants, in the dark and misled them with talk for so long; that only after October 25, whenthe Second Peasants’ Congress was convened, we saw thatthere could be no reconciliation between the Right andLeft Socialist-Revolutionaries, and it was then that therecame a series of congresses, starting with the soldiers’ and peasants’ and ending with the railwaymen’s congress. 
 Everywhere we found the same picture: everywhere there was, on the one hand, the vast majority of those who trulybelonged to the working and exploited people, and camedown fully, unconditionally and irrevocably on the side ofSoviet power, and on the other, the top layers of the bour-geoisie, the civil servants, the executives, the rich peasants, all of whom sided with the propertied classes and the bour-geoisie, and put out the slogan: “All power to the Constit-uent Assembly”, the assembly that was elected before therevolution, when the people had no way of distinguishingbetween Right and Left Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
 No, indeed, the revolution of the working classes comes first and not the old lists; the interests of the working and exploit-ed people who were oppressed before the revolution areparamount. 
 If the Constituent Assembly goes against thewill of Soviet power, the will of a clear majority of theworking people, we say: Down with the Constituent Assem-bly, and long live Soviet power. 
 ( Applause . 
) Comrades, it is our daily experience that Soviet power is meeting withever greater support from the poor, the working and exploit-ed people in every branch of the economy and in every partof the country, and no matter how we may be slandered bybourgeois and by “socialist” newspapers, like those of Ke-rensky’s party, the Right Socialist-Revolutionaries, no matter how they may lie that our power is against thepeople and does not have their support, they will still be patently lying. 
 We got some very strong confirmation of this just today. 
 It was a report from the Don area (a night tele-gram) about a congress held by a section of the Cossacks in Voronezh, and a congress of 20 Cossack regiments and 5batteries in Kamenskaya village. 
 The Cossacks at the frontconvened their own congress because they saw that Kaledinwas rallying officers, cadets and landowners’ sons who donot want the Soviets to take power in Russia and want the Don to have self-determination. 
 A party is being formed there around Kaledin, who styles himself the great chief-tain. 
 And so the congress of the front-line Cossacks had tobe dispersed. 
 169 The Cossacks countered by, firstly, uniting with the Voronezh Congress, and secondly, by declaring waron Kaledin, thirdly, arresting the Cossack atamans, and fourthly, occupying all the main stations. 
 Let the Ryabushinskys, who sent millions abroad and donated millions over here to pay the saboteurs for obstruct-ing Soviet power, let the Ryabushinskys, and the capital-ists of France and Britain, together with the king of Ruma-nia, let them all bewail their fate; their last stake has been lost even in the Don area, where there were the greatest number of rich peasants who lived on hired labour, whoexploited the labour of others, and carried on a constantstruggle against the migrant labourers driven to those partsfrom afar by privation; even there, where exploiter-peasantswere most numerous, the people resent this organisation of cadets, officers and property-owners who have decided to oppose Soviet power. 
 Even there we find the same divisionwhich everyone ignores and for which the blame is being puton us. 
 “The Bolsheviks have declared civil war. 
” Is it po~-sible that we have invented Kaledin; is it possible that theBolsheviks have invented Ryabushinsky? We all know that they were the mainstay of the tsarist regime, and are now merely lying in wait, biding their time to turn the RussianRepublic into the kind of bourgeois republic that you havein most countries where, with all the liberty and represen-tation, the working people are oppressed just as much as,if not more than, in any monarchy. 
 When we hear it said that the Bolsheviks are kindling a fratricidal war, a civil war, when curses are heaped on the Bolsheviks for havingbrought about the criminal fratricidal civil war, we reply: “What kind of fratricidal war is this? Are the Ryabushinskys and Kaledins the working people’s brothers? It is strange that the sailors, the soldiers, the workers and the peasants had no inkling of this; it is strange that they had never not-iced this before; and it is strange that they firmly demandthat the Ryabushinskys and Kaledins submit to Sovietpower. 
” The absurd, madcap attempt on the part of the cadets and officers to stage an uprising in Petrograd and Moscow fizzled out because the vast majority of the workers andsoldiers are clearly on the side of Soviet power. 
 They wereaware that if they started a war, the soldiers would bearmed and would not give up their arms to anyone. 
 Thepeople rallied to take their destiny into their own hands, and that was why they started the revolution. 
 They were very well aware that over here, in Petrograd, the peoplewere solidly behind Soviet power, and so when they wererouted both in Petrograd and Moscow they rushed to the Donarea to engineer a counter-revolutionary plot against theworking people over there, hoping to get support from the bourgeois Rada in Kiev, which is on its last legs because it no longer commands confidence. 
 Having declared civilwar on the working people everywhere, they accused usof starting it. 
 They said: You are fostering civil war, downwith civil war. 
 We replied: Down with the Ryabushinskysand Kaledins and all their accomplices. 
 ( Applause . 
) That is why, comrades, we say it is not true that we are destroying democracy as the bourgeoisie’s grave charge andassertion runs; nor is it true that we have destroyed faithin the forms of democracy, in the cherished democraticinstitutions which have for so long supported and fed therevolutionary movement in Russia; it is not true that we have destroyed the highest form of democracy, the Constit-uent Assembly. 
 Under the republic of the socialist Keren-sky—a republic of the imperialist chieftains, the chieftainsof the bourgeoisie with secret treaties in thier pockets, driv-ing the soldiers to war (and calling it a just war)—the Con-stituent Assembly was naturally preferable to the Pre-parl-iament, in which Kerensky, by agreement with Chernov and Tsereteli, conducted the same policy. 
 We have beenopenly and straightforwardly gaying from the very start of the revolution—April 1917—that the Soviets were a much higher, a very much more perfect and purposeful form of democracy—a working people’s democracy—than the Con-stituent Assembly. 
 * The Constituent Assembly unites all classes, which means also the exploiter classes, the proper-tied classes, hence, the bourgeoisie and those who receivedtheir education at the expense of the people, at the expenseof the exploited, and abandoned the people to join the capi-talists, turning their knowledge, the greatest achievements of knowledge, into a tool for oppressing the people, andfighting the working classes. 
 For our part we declare thatwhen a revolution of the working and exploited classesbreaks out, all power in the state goes to their organisation. 
This form of democracy is incomparably higher than the old one. 
 No party invented the Soviets. 
 You know very well that no party could have invented them. 
 They werebrought to life by the 1905 revolution. 
 And although at thattime the Soviets were short-lived, it was clear that theywere the people’s only reliable bulwark in the struggleagainst the autocracy. 
 Whenever the Soviets declined and gave way to some national representative institutions—as all these Dumas, congresses and assemblies have shown—theConstitutional-Democrats, the capitalists and exploiterscame to the fore, deals were made with the tsar, the organsof the people’s movement declined and the revolution col-lapsed. 
 That is why when the 1917 Revolution did not merely revive the Soviets but extended a network of them across the country, they taught the workers, soldiers and peasantsthat they could and should take all state power into theirown hands, not as in bourgeois parliaments, where everycitizen has the same rights as the next man. 
 Life will notbe sweeter for the poor if the worker proclaims that he is the equal of Ryabushinsky, and the peasant the equal of a man who owns 12,000 dessiatines of land. 
 That is why thebest form of democracy, the best democratic republic is powerwithout the landowners and the rich. 
 The Russian people gained a great deal of experience much faster and came to a decision in a matter of months because of the war.

 ine, the danger of extinction, the physical destruction of millions of people. 
 From April 20 on, when the wounded Linde marched his soldiers out into a street in Petrograd to overthrow the government of Milyukov and Guch1sov,through the long period of ministerial leapfrogging, when allthe parties kowtowed the Constitutional-Democrats and viedwith each other in displaying loud and alluring programmes,the people saw for themselves that it was no use at all: they had been promised peace, but were in fact driven into an offensive. 
 In June 1917, tens of thousands of soldiers diedbecause of this secret treaty between the tsar and the Euro-pean imperialists, which Kerensky honoured. 
 It was not pro-paganda but this first-hand experience that helped the peopleto make a comparison between the socialist power of the Soviets and the bourgeois republic. 
 They carried away the conviction that there was nothing in the old reforms and theold institutions of bourgeois imperialism for the workingand exploited people, and that only the power of the Sovietswas good enough for them. 
 The people—and this includesworkers, soldiers, peasants and railwaymen, in fact, all working people—are free to elect their own deputies to the Soviets and are free to recall them when they do not satisfythe people’s demands and wishes. 
 You don’t sit in a Sovietto interpret laws or make brilliant parliamentary speechesbut to implement the freedoms and throw off the yoke ofexploitation. 
 The workers, on their own, will build their state on new lines; they will build a new life in the new Russia without any room for exploiters. 
 That is what pro-duced the Soviets, and that is why we say that the experi-ence of the Russian revolution showed the people and wentto confirm something we had said long ago, namely, thatSoviet power is a much higher form of democracy than any bourgeois republic that has taken shape in Western Europe; in a real democracy, the working classes can and mustcontrol the non-working elements, the exploiting section ofsociety; workers, soldiers, peasants and railwaymen can betheir own masters; they can arrange an exchange of goodsbetween towns and villages, and set a fair wage, without the capitalists and landowners. 
 That is why the Soviet Republic in Russia has now taken the shape of a fully socialist republic which has taken away the land from the landowners, established workers’ control in industry, and put the banks in the hands of so-cialist workers’ organisations, giving the people access to the immense wealth accumulated and stockpiled by thecapitalists to manage and use for the greater welfare andcultural growth of all the working people and not for theiroppression. 
 That is the task facing the Soviet Republic. 
And this is why we have so much sympathy among the peo-ple, the working classes abroad, in spite of the military censorship of the tsars, and the harassment of socialistnewspapers by the Kerenskys abroad. 
 The bourgeois news-papers over there tell lies about this country in a mostshameful fashion; our newspapers are suppressed: not asingle issue of Pravda has been allowed to go through. 
 A few days ago a friend of mine returned from Switzerland, from that part of the country where I recently spent so manymiserable days, and he said that people in free Switzerlandwere not aware of the fact that the free republics of freeEurope were not letting through any issues of our paper,that they read only the wholesale lies circulated by the bourgeois newspapers, which do nothing but rail at the Bolsheviks. 
 Yet the workers in all countries have understoodthat Soviet power in Russia is truly a working people’sgovernment. 
 You will not find a single worker in Europetoday—either in Britain, France, Germany or any othercountry—who does not applaud news of the Russian revo-lution, because they all regard it with hope and see it as a torch that will light the flame all over Europe. 
 The Russian revolution was such a simple affair only because Russia had been under the most savage oppressionof tsarism and because no other country had been torn andtortured by the war as she had been. 
 The Russian people were the first to raise the torch of the socialist revolution, but they are aware that they are notalone in their struggle and that they will accomplish theirtask with the help of the most loyal comrades and friends. 
We don’t know how long it will take for the socialist revo-lution to break out in the other countries—it may take a long time. 
 You know how revolutions generally take place in other countries. 
 Everyone here has been through 1917,and you all know that three months before the revolution started, no one knew that it was coming. 
 We know that workers’ strikes have already spread to Austria. 
 When the European parties headed by their local Chernovs and Tsere-telis began to lose control of events and felt they had lostall touch, there was talk of martial law there, and o£ mili-tary dictatorship, in Germany; the strikes in Vienna havenow been stopped and the papers are out again. 
 I have receiveda telegram from our Stockholm representative, Vorovsky, and he says that the movement has undoubtedly halted but that it is impossible to crush it altogether, and that itwould go on. 
 There you have one of the results of the factthat the peace negotiations have opened at Brest and thatwe have kept our promise. 
 The secret treaties have beenabrogated, published and exposed to public shame. 
 We have shown that we regard these commitments of the old capital-ists—whether they are known as secret treaties or loans—as mere scraps of paper to be swept aside because they ham-per us, the working masses, in our construction of socialistsociety. 
 The working masses are beginning to realise theimpudence of the German demands at Brest, which revealed the same plunderous and predacious urge behind a screen of promises to accept a just peace. 
 The delay is artificial,and the masses are clear on this: they say that the war canbe stopped, because the Russian workers and peasants havestopped it, and that an offensive can be started against thegovernments. 
 On October 17, 1905, the first great nation-wide strike was suppressed by the autocracy, but it sparked off a chain of events and workers’ demonstrations in Austria,in Vienna and Prague, and that was when the Austrianswon their universal suffrage. 
 Although the Russian revolu-tion of 1905 was crushed by tsarism, it gave hope to theWest-European workers of great reforms in the future, that is, the very events now taking place. 
 When the Third Congress of Soviets opened, you all saw a number of delegates from foreign parties who said in onevoice that from their observation of the working-class move-ment in Britain, Switzerland and America they drew theconclusion that the socialist revolution in Europe was becom-ing a task of the day. 
 The bourgeoisie over there is strong-er and cleverer than our Kerenskys; it has managed to getorganised to make the uprising of the masses more difficult. 
 Over there the workers have a measure of prosperity, which is why it is more difficult to shake up the old socialist par-ties which had been there for decades, had come to power, and had acquired authority in the eyes of the people. 
 Butthat kind of authority is already running out, the massesare surging, and there is no doubt at all that in the near—or possibly more remote—future, the socialist revolutionwill be on the order of the day in all countries, because the oppression of capital is at an end. 
 When we are told that the Bolsheviks have invented this utopian idea of introducing socialism in Russia, which is animpossible thing, we reply: How did it happen that utopiansand dreamers enjoy the sympathy of the majority of theworkers, peasants and soldiers? Did not the majority of the workers, peasants and soldiers side with us because they had acquired a first-hand knowledge of the war and itseffects? They realised that there was no way out of the oldsociety, that the capitalists with all their marvels of tech-nology and culture were engaged in a destructive war,and that men had degenerated to a state of frenzy, savagery and starvation. 
 That is what the capitalists have done, and that is why we are faced with the alternative of perishing ordemolishing the old bourgeois society. 
 That explains whyour revolution has depth. 
 That is why we find that in tinyneighbouring Estland, where the people are literate, therewas recently a congress of farm-hands who elected agents to take control of all the efficient farms. 
 This is a world-shaking development: farms are controlled by farm-hands who hadalways been at the very bottom of the social scale in thecapitalist economy. 
 Then take Finland, where the Diet spokeon behalf of the nation, and the bourgeoisie demanded thatwe should recognise her independence. 
 We were not going to use force to keep under Russia’s control or in one Russian state any of the nations tsarism had kept in by oppression. 
We had not planned to attract other nations—the Ukraine orFinland—by force or imposition but by allowing them to setup their own socialist system, their own Soviet republics. 
We now find that a working-class revolution is expected to break out in Finland almost any day. 
 This is the same Fin-land that had enjoyed complete internal freedom for 12years—since 1905—and had the right to elect democratic institutions. 
 Between 1905 and 1917, the sparks of the fire which the Bolsheviks are alleged to have fanned artificially, also penetrated into that country which is distinguished for its high culture, its efficient economy and its history, andwe find the socialist revolution beginning there as. 
well. 
This proves that we are not blinded by party struggles, thatwe had not acted according to plan, and that it was nothingbut mankind’s hopeless state since the war began that brought on the revolution, and made the socialist revoiu-tion invincible. 
 Comrades, let me point out in conclusion that the same thing has happened at this railwaymen’s congress. 
 We sawyour hard fight against your top-drawer railway organisa-tions. 
 You railwaymen have seen for yourselves that the mass of working railway proletarians bore the brunt of the effort to get the railways running. 
 Things did not come tosuch a pass by pure chance: either they had been deliberatelyhampered by the bourgeoisie, bribed by the millionaires whothrew in hundreds of thousands of rubles and were preparedto go to any length to destroy Soviet power, or had been caused by the bourgeoisie’s refusal to change the system, because it held that that was how God had ordained allthings—there have always been masters and servants, andthe rich have always abused the poor who worked for them. 
In effect the railway officials thought that such a state ofaffairs had been ordained by God, which meant there could be no other system, and that chaos would result from any attempt to change it. 
 But that did not happen. 
 The unityof the working masses is paramount; they will establish theirown discipline of equals and, using the technical and cultur-al achievements, make the railways run like clockwork,and carry on the exchange of goods between town and co-untry to help the workers and peasants organise the economy on a Russia-wide scale and enable the working masses tomake use of the products of their labour without the capi-talists and landowners. 
 When this is done scientific andtechnical knowledge will no longer help a handful of men toget rich and stuff their money-bags, but will help to improve the operation of the railway system as a whole. 
 This is of especial importance to us. 
 You know how much corruption,swindling and speculation there is at each junction; you also know that the exploiters are spending millions to disrupt transportation and get cars into places where they cannot be found. 
 All this is being done to aggravate the famine and incite the people against Soviet power. 
 But youall know that if the majority of railway organisations uniteand set themselves the task of supporting Soviet power, allthe swindlers, saboteurs, capitalists and exploiters—all theseremnants of bourgeois society will be ruthlessly swept away. 
 Only then will it be possible to organise the railways in a proper manner and achieve the complete liberation ofthe workers, soldiers and peasants from the power of theoppressors. 
 Only then we shall have socialism. 
 ( The entire audience joins in stormy applause. 
 ) 2 REPLIES TO NOTES Comrades, the notes lying before me fall into two groups: one raises the question of the Constituent Assembly, the other, of the famine and the economic chaos. 
 I shall reply on these two points, putting those notes together that moreor less refer to the same topic. 
 About the Constituent Assem-bly we are being asked: Was it fair to dissolve it, andshouldn’t another one be convened? Or wouldn’t it have beenmore correct to refer the question to a popular referendum before dissolving the Constituent Assembly? No, comrades, neither a referendum nor a new constituent assembly canhelp matters. 
 That is how the parties in Russia have takenshape. 
 We have seen where the sympathies of the capital-ists, and where those of the workers and peasants lie. 
 So-viet power was not established by decree or party resolution, because it is above parties, and is the outcome of revolution-ary experience, the experience of millions of men: it wasno accident at all that the Soviets first emerged in 1905,and in 1917 grew to full stature and established a new repub-lic, the likes of which do not exist in any European country,and will not exist in any of them so long as they are ruled by capital. 
 But the Soviet Republic will triumph everywhere, and that is when the decisive blow will be dealt at capi-tal. 
 I must point out that the Constituent Assembly and thereferendum are based on the old bourgeois parliamentarypattern and because capital holds sway, any popular pollhas to reckon and bargain with it. 
 Soviet power does not produce men who fence in parliament and exchange brilli-ant speeches, the while consolidating the rule of capital andthe bureaucracy. 
 Soviet power springs from the working masses themselves; it does not produce a parliament, but an assembly of working people’s representatives who enact laws which are implemented immediately, are translated into life and are aimed at fighting the exploiters. 
 The old-typeconstituent assembly and referendum were designed to unitethe will of the whole nation and create the possibility ofthe sheep living side by side with the wolves, the exploitedwith the exploiters. 
 That is something we don’t want. 
 It is something we have tried out and gone through. 
 We’ve had enough. 
 And we are sure that the majority of the workers,peasants and soldiers feel that way too. 
 At a time when thewar has forced us to make a series of heroic efforts to escapethe grip of capital or perish in the attempt, we are invited toput on an experiment which had already been tried out in some European countries, and which would give us the old bourgeois capitalism and national representation, insteadof the representation of the working masses. 
 We do notwant bourgeois representation but the representation ofthe exploited and the oppressed that would wage a ruthlessfight against the exploiters. 
 That is the intention of Sovie~ power, which does not include either parliament or refe-rendum. 
 It is superior to both, because if the working peopleare dissatisfied with their party they can elect other dele-gates, hand power to another party and change the govern-ment without any revolution at all, for their experience ofKerensky-Kaledin and the bourgeois Rada has shown that it is impossible to fight against Soviet power. 
 There might be a handful of men in Russia today fighting against Sovietpower, but such eccentrics are few, and they will disappearin a matter of weeks, while Soviet power will triumph as anorganisation of the oppressed class for the ovarthrow of theoppressors and removal of the exploiters. 
 I now come to the famine, this horrible curse of our time which threatens us. 
 What is the main cause of the chaos?The main cause of the chaos which threatens the towns andindustrial areas with famine is the sway of saboteurs, andthe economic chaos these saboteurs keep stirring up, whileblaming it on us. 
 We are very well aware that there is enough grain in Russia and that it is stored in Kaledin’s realm, in far-away Siberia and in the grain producing gu-bernias. 
 I must say that the exploited classes will never succeed in liberating themselves unless they set up a firm, ruthless and revolutionary government. 
 About the sabo-teurs, let me say, comrades, that we know the addresses at which sabotaging civil servants called to collect and signfor a three-month advance on their salaries, to which Ryabu-shinsky had contributed 5 million, the Anglo-French impe-rialists so much, and the Rumanian, so much. 
 Here is whatsabotage means: it means people, senior officials, who are bribed and whose only purpose is to overthrow Soviet power, although many of them are not aware of this. 
 Sabotage is theeffort to restore the old paradise for the exploiters and theold hell for the working people. 
 But if we are to frustratethem in this purpose, we must break down their resistance. 
 Railwaymen’s pay is another point that has been brought to our notice. 
 This is nothing but a misunderstanding. 
 It may have been that one commissar took this view of theaffair and issued a decree but amended it 170 as soon as he received instructions from the Council of People’s Commis-sars, so that anyone who says that that had been the SovietGovernment’s intention doesn’t know what he is talking about. 
 What are we to do to eliminate the famine and the chaos? Firstly, the capitalists’ resistance must be broken, and thesaboteurs driven to the wall. 
 When the supporters of Novaya Zhizn and other ostensibly socialist periodicals say that sabotage has not been stopped in these ten weeks, I say: why don’t you help us stop it? The banks have now passed under the authority of the Soviets. 
 Here is what happenedyesterday: a certain specialist writer by the name of Finn-Yenotayevsky came to see me on behalf of 50,000 personsand declared that the banks were prepared to operate enti-rely under the authority of Soviet power. 
 ( Loud applause . 
) “High time, too,” I said to this spokesman of the bank offici-als. 
 We will not refuse to negotiate with any organisation,be it an organisation of bank officials or any other, providedsuch recognition of Soviet power is actually accepted by themajority of the working people. 
 That is what we were toldby the bank officials who are in the habit of putting through unheard-of speculative deals to turn an honest penny, all of which keeps their pockets bulging with profits running intomillions of rubles. 
 Now they want to negotiate with us, but these negotiations will differ from those of Kerensky. 
 We shall not discuss any reform of banking. 
 After occupying the banks with armed force, we enter into negotiations and issue orders and instruc-tions. 
 It is important for us to break down the resistance ofthe saboteurs before opening negotiations. 
 That is the wayto fight the famine and the chaos, and this alone can helpus to overcome the horrors of capitalism and anarchy. 
 You know of the terrible chaos that has spread everywhere in the world, especially in Russia, where tsarism has left alegacy of graft, violence, hatred and humiliation of theworking people. 
 This is followed by complaints about chaos;I put it to you: can the war-weary men who have stood inthe trenches for three years fight to increase the profits of the Russian capitalists and capture Constantinople for them? On every hand they see that millions are being spentto overthrow Soviet power and get the country under control. 
 Comrades, such changes cannot be expected to take place overnight. 
 The socialist revolution is on, and everythingnow depends on the establishment of a discipline of equals, the discipline of the working masses themselves, which must take the place of capitalist barrack-room discipline. 
 Whenthe railway workers take power into their own hands, theywill wipe out sabotage and speculation through their armedorganisation, and set themselves the task of prosecutingthose who engage in graft and disrupt railway traffic. 
 Such people should be prosecuted as arch-criminals, fighting against the people’s power. 
 It is on such a well-knit, vigorousorganisation—a Soviet organisation—that the fight againstthe capitalists, the saboteurs, the swindlers and the Ryabu-shinskys depends. 
 That is the way to defeat the famine,because Russia has everything she needs: iron, oil and grain, in short, everything it takes to have a decent life. 
 If we de-feat the exploiters, we shall establish Soviet power andeconomic control in Russia, and that is the way it is goingto be.

 The facts of abuse are glaring, the speculation, mon-strous; but what have the mass of soldiers and workers doneabout it? You cannot do anything without rousing the masses to action. 
 A plenary meeting of the Soviet must be called to decide on mass searches in Petrograd and the goods stations. 
To carry out these searches, each factory and company mustform contingents, not on a voluntary basis: it must be theduty of everyone to take part in these searches under thethreat of being deprived of his bread card. 
 We can’t expect to get anywhere unless we resort to terrorism: speculators must be shot on the spot. 
 Moreover, bandits must be dealtwith just as resolutely: they must be shot on the spot. 
 The rich section of the population must be left without bread for three days because they have stocks of other food-stuffs and can afford to pay the speculators the higher price.

 (B. 
) JANUARY 19 (FEBRUARY 1), 1918 MINUTES 1 Comrade Lenin asks what kind of conference should be called. 
174 He believes we should have it out with the advo-cates of a revolutionary war, because their remark seems tohint at the charge that one group within the Party suspectsthe other of being diplomatic on the question of peace. 
Actually, there is no diplomacy involved at all, because the armistice decision said quite openly that any side wish-ing to terminate it must announce its intention to do soseven days before the start of hostilities. 
 On that ground wehave been marking time with the peace. 
 How was the deci-sion adopted at the Third Congress of Soviets? It was adop-ted as proposed by the Central Executive Committee, which adopted its decision on the strength of the Party group de-cision, and the latter adopted it in line with a C. 
C. 
 resolu-tion. 
 Lenin believes that the best way to dissuade the com-rades favouring a revolutionary war would be for them to goto the front and see for themselves that it is quite impossibleto conduct the war. 
 Nor does he see any sense in having a conference, because its decisions could not be binding on the Central Committee; in view of this it might be necessaryfor us to call a Party congress 175 to get precise instructions from the Party. 
 By dragging out the peace talks we arecreating an opportunity to continue fraternisation, and byconcluding a peace we could at once have an exchange of prisoners of war, thereby sending to Germany a great mass of people who had seen our revolution in action and hadbeen schooled by it. 
 It would be easier for them to work on the awakening of a revolution in Germany. 
 He believes, in addition, that in order to ascertain exactly what is going on in Germany we should send aviators to Berlin, which, they say, is quite possible. 
 2 Comrade Lenin, speaking on a point of order, suggests that Bukharin should give the facts on the state of af~airs within the Petrograd Committee. 
 3 Comrade Lenin makes a concrete proposal. 
 He points out to those who want a conference that it would not heal the rift. 
 A Party congress is a necessity, whereas a conferencemerely elicits opinion in the Party which should be put onrecord. 
 With that end in view he proposes the convocationof a meeting representing all shades of opinion and stand-points, each by at least three persons. 
 Such a meeting should work out an agreement. 
 4 Comrade Lenin suggests the meeting should be held within two or three days, without publishing the theses, which should not be made known to Germany. 
 The question of the conference should not be solved before the meeting, but itwould be absurd to defer the question of peace until a con-gress without publishing the theses. 
 5 Comrade Lenin proposes a meeting of delegates leaving after the Third Congress of Soviets, without, however, any-thing being handed out in writing. 
 6 Comrade Lenin says that the Party programme will not be ready by February 15, and proposes that: the meeting should be held on January 2D, and should be made up as follows: (1) Central Committee; (2) representa-tives of clearly expressed opinions, namely, Lenin, Sokolni-kov, Bukharin, Obolensky, Stukov. 
 If Smirnov, Obolensky,Stukov and Pyatakov differ, they will send two representa-tives, and otherwise, one; (3) the Petrograd Committee tobe represented by Fenigstein; (4) a Latvian. 
 Bukharin and Lomov should be authorised to talk it over with the Muscovites and with Pyatakov. 
 Each group to present its own theses.

 SPECIAL TO THE PEACE DELEGATION IN BREST -LITOVSK We are also extremely alarmed that the line177 is out of order for which, we think, the Germans are to blame. 
 TheKiev Rada has fallen. 
 All power in the Ukraine is in thehands of the Soviet. 
 The Kharkov Central Executive Com-mittee holds undivided sway over the Ukraine; Bolshevik Kotsubinsky has been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the troops of the Ukrainian Republic. 
 In Finland, the affairsof the bourgeois counter-revolutionaries are hopeless, andworkers’ resentment is running extremely high. 
 At a con-gress in the village of Kamenskaya, the Don area, 46 Cossackregiments proclaimed themselves the government, and are fighting against Kaledin. 
 There is great enthusiasm among Petrograd workers over the formation of a Soviet of Workers’Deputies in Berlin. 
 There are rumours that Karl Liebknechthas been released and will soon head the German Govern-ment. 
 Tomorrow’s sitting of the Petrograd Soviet will dis-cuss a message to the Berlin and Vienna Soviets of Workers. 
 Written on January 21 (February 3), 1918 First published in 1929 Published according in Lenin Miscellany XI to the manuscript WIRELESS MESSAGE ADDRESSED TO ALL. 
 Calling Everybody A number of newspapers abroad have published false reports of horrors and chaos in Petrograd, etc. 
 All these reports are absolutely untrue. 
 There is complete calm in Petrograd and Moscow. 
 No socialists have beenarrested. 
 Kiev is in the hands of the Ukrainian Soviet autho-rities. 
 The Kiev bourgeois Rada has fallen and dispersed. 
 The authority of the llkrainian Soviet~ Kharkov has beenfully recognised. 
 On the Don, 46 Cossack regiments haverevolted against Kaledin. 
 Orenburg has been taken by theSoviet authorities and the Cossack ataman, Dutov, has beenrouted and is in flight. 
 In Finland, the victory of the Fin-nish workers’ government is being rapidly consolidated, the counter-revolutionary whiteguard troops have been pushedback to the North, and the workers’ victory over them iscertain. 
 There has been an improvement in the food situation in Petrograd. 
 Today, January 22, 1918, old style, Petrograd workers are sending 10 carloads of food to aid the Finns. 
 Information about Germany is very scarce. 
 The Germans are clearly concealing the truth about the revolutionarymovement in Germany. 
 Trotsky has telegraphed to Petro-grad from Brest-Litovsk that the Germans are dragging outthe talks. 
 The German bourgeois press, obviously given its cue, is spreading false reports about Russia to intimidate the public. 
 A decree on the complete separation of church and state and the confiscation of all church property was publishedyesterday, January 21, 1918. 
 Written on January 22 (February 4), 1918 First published in 1929 Published according in Lenin Miscellany XI to the manuscript SPEECH TO PROPAGANDISTS ON THEIR WAY TO THE PROVINCES JANUARY 23 (FEBRUARY 5), 1918 NEWSPAPER REPORT Comrades, you all know that Soviet power has been re-cognised by the majority of the workers, soldiers and peas-ants of the Russian nation and of other nations which in the old days were part of Russia by compulsion and are nowparts of the free Russian Republic. 
 We now have before usa short struggle against the pathetic remnants of Kaledin’scounter-revolutionary troops, who, it seems, has to savehimself from the revolutionary Cossacks in his home Don area. 
 Now that the last bastion of the counter-revolution is about to collapse it is safe to say that Soviet power is grow-ing stronger and it will be consolidated. 
 Everyone canunderstand this, for there is compelling proof that only thispower—the workers, soldiers and peasants in their Soviets— can lead Russia to a free working people’s community. 
 We are confronted with two powerful enemies, the first of which is international capital. 
 There it stands ragingat the consolidation of Soviet power it hates. 
 There is nodoubt that these multi-millionaires must wage war over anextra piece of the pie grabbed from someone else. 
 There is no doubt either that they are as yet stronger than the Soviet Republic. 
 But it turns out that although the capitalists are strong-er than we are, they have already been sending their mento our Commissars, and might even recognise Soviet powerand, what is more, our repudiation of the loans, which for these tightwads would really be a most painful and terrible blow. 
 The fact that the agents of the international financialoligarchy have broached the subject shows that the capi-talists of the world have reached an impasse. 
 They would love to extricate themselves from the war and throw their full force against the hated Soviet Republic, which has started a conflagration all over Europe and America, butthey cannot. 
 Our revolution sprang from the war: but for the war; we would find the capitalists of the world banded and rangedagainst us. 
 Their only worry is to prevent the sparks of our fire from falling on their roofs. 
 But you can’t throw up a Chinese Wall around Russia. 
 We have yet to hear ofa workers’ organisation anywhere in the world that is notelated at our decrees on land, nationalisation of the banks,etc. 
 We may be faced with a stiff fight in the future, but you should never forget, comrades, that in most countries the workers, oppressed by their capitalists, are already awaken-ing, and the Kaledinites of all countries, no matter howthey rave, will never be able to consolidate their positions,even if they manage to get in a blow at Russia. 
 Upon theother hand, our position is sound because we have the work-ers of all countries behind us. 
 ( Applause . 
) Chaos is our other enemy. 
 It has to be fought with great-er vigour now that the position of the Soviets has becomestronger. 
 That struggle, comrades, is one you must promote. 
Great importance now attaches to your trip, the trip ofpropagandists from both government parties now at the head of Soviet power. 
 I believe that in the backwoods you will derive a great deal of satisfaction from persistent effortsto build up Soviet power and spread revolutionary ideas inthe villages, eliminate the chaos and liberate the toilingpeasants from the village kulaks. 
 We are faced with some very hard work in healing the wounds of war. 
 The bourgeoisie of other European countries had made better preparations than ours did. 
 Over therethey had a correct distribution of foodstuffs, which is whythey now have it easier; they also had a system of rotatingthe soldiers at the front. 
 Nothing of the sort had been doneby the tsarist regime or by the Kerensky government, which was a vacillating, conciliating bourgeois regime. 
 That is why Russia now finds herself in such dire straits. 
 To lay the foundation of socialist society on the ruins she must solve the tasks of organisation and struggle against those who are war-weary and against the criminal elements who play up the chaos for their own benefit. 
 Comrades, you have before you some very difficult but, as I have said, satisfying work which boils down to gettingthe rural economy running and building up Soviet power. 
But you have assistants, for we know that every worker andpeasant earning his own livelihood feels, deep down in his heart, that there is no salvation from famine and ruin but in Soviet power. 
 We can save Russia. 
 There is every indica-tion that Russia has the grain, and it would have been avail-able if we had taken stock of it in good time and distributedit fairly. 
 Cast your mind’s eye over the boundless expansesof Russia and her disrupted railways and you will realise that we need to tighten up the control and distribution of grain, if this famine is not to be the end of us all. 
 Thiscan be done only on one condition, which is that each worker,each peasant and each citizen must understand that he hasno one to look to but himself. 
 Comrades, no one is going tohelp you. 
 All the bourgeoisie, the civil servants, the sabo-teurs are against you, for they know that if the people man-age to share out among themselves this national wealth whichhad been in the hands of the capitalists and kulaks, theywill rid Russia of the chaff and the drones. 
 That is whythey have mustered against the working people all theirforces, ranging from Kaledin and Dutov to the saboteurs, the bribed vagrants and those who are simply weary and are habitually unable to put up any resistance because theyare mesmerised by the exploiting bourgeoisie. 
 One day theybribe ignorant soldiers to raid wine and spirit warehouses;the next day they get railway officials to hold up freightsor shipowners to hold up grain barges, etc. 
, on their way to the capital. 
 But when the people come to realise that organisation alone will bring cohesion and the conscious dis-cipline of equals, they need have no fear of any tricks on thepart of the bourgeoisie. 
 That is the job you have, that is where you must work to unite, organise and establish Soviet power. 
 Out there in the countryside, you will come across “bourgeois” peasants, the kulaks, who will try to upset Soviet power. 
 It will beeasy to fight them because the mass will be on your side. 
 They will see that it is not punitive expeditions but propa-gandists that are sent from the centre to bring light to the countryside, to unite those in every village who earn their own livelihood and have never lived at the expense of others. 
 Take the question of land: it has been declared public propert-y and all types of private property are being abol-ished. 
 This marks a great step towards the elimination ofexploitation. 
 There will be a struggle between the rich and the working peasants, and it is not bookish help that the poor need butexperience and actual participation in the struggle. 
 We didnot take away the land from the landowners to let the richpeasants and the kulaks get it. 
 It is for the poor. 
 This willwin you the sympathies of the poor peasants. 
 You must see to it that farm implements and machines do not remain in the hands of the kulaks and rich peasants. 
They must belong to Soviet power and be temporarily allot-ted to the working peasants for their use, through the volostcommittees. 
 They themselves must see to it that these ma-chines are not used to enrich the kulaks but to cultivate their own land. 
 Every peasant will help you in this difficult task. 
 You must explain to the people in the villages that the kulaksand sharks must be pulled up short. 
 There is need for aneven distribution of products so that the working peoplecan enjoy the fruits of the people’s labour. 
 Ten working people must stand up against every rich man who stretches out his avaricious paw towards public property. 
 The Soviets have a revenue of 8,000 million and an expen-diture of 28,0~0 million. 
 With such a state of affairs we arenaturally going to fail, unless we manage to pull the statechariot out of the bog into which the tsarist regime drove it. 
 The external war is over or nearly so. 
 There is no doubt on that score. 
 It is an internal war that is now before us. 
The bourgeoisie, its plundered goods hidden in its chests,is not worried and thinks: “We shall sit this out. 
” The peoplemust ferret out the sharks and make them disgorge. 
 This is your task in the localities. 
 If we are not to collapse, we must get at them in their hideouts. 
 It is not the police who mustmake them disgorge—the police are dead and buried—the people themselves must do this, and there is no other way of fighting them. 
 One old Bolshevik gave a correct explanation of Bolshe-vism to a Cossack. 
 The Cossack asked him: “Is it true that you Bolsheviks plunder?” “Yes, indeed,” said the old man,”we plunder theplunder. 
” 178 We shall sink in this sea unless we manage to extract from those coffers all that is stored in them, all that has been amassed through plunder over the years of ruthlesscriminal exploitation. 
 We in the Central Executive Committee will soon adopt a law on a new tax on the property holders, but it is up toyou to put this through in the localities and get the work-ing people to lay their hands on all the hundred ruble notes tucked away since the war. 
 But this should not bedone by force of arms: the shooting war is over but thisone is ahead of us. 
 Our revolution will not be overthrown by the force of the exploiters, if we go about this business efficiently, be-cause the world proletariat is on our side.

 Lenin Written on January 28 (February 10), 1918 First published in 1929 Published according in Lenin Miscellany XI to the manuscript SPEEC H AT A MEETIN G OF THE LAN D COMMITTEE CONGRESS AND THE PEASAN T SECTION OF THE THIR D CONGRESS OF SOVIETS JANUAR Y 28 (FEBRUAR Y 10), 1918180 NEWSPAPER REPORT We are now engaged in the great task of consolidating the gains of the working masses, the great task of uniting the workers, soldiers and peasants. 
 At the Peasant Congress where the Rights had a majority I said that if the peasantsrecognised all our demands we in turn would support all thepeasant demands, the chief of which is socialisation of land. 
 * We have now done this. 
 We have passed the world’s firstlaw abolishing all private ownership of land. 
 We now have power, the power of the Soviets. 
 This power, brought to the fore by the people themselves, lays a sound foundation forthe great cause of world peace. 
 The war has been stopped,and demobilisation has been ordered on every front. 
 Thereis still the war against the bourgeoisie which is mobilisingall its forces to fight Soviet power. 
 We have almost put an end to the Russian counter-revolution. 
 We are gaining the upper hand in almost every battle fought on all the fronts. 
There is still another enemy; it is international capital;the fight against this enemy will be a long one and we shallwin by getting organised and obtaining support for ourrevolution from the international proletariat. 
 We are still faced with a big fight, the class struggle at home. 
 This is an economic struggle against the bourgeoisie, who, directlyor indirectly, support our enemies and who will try toestablish economic domination over the working masses. 
 One thing that we suffer from, that makes our country weak, is the lack of money. 
 The big kulaks in town and country still have lots of money, which is evidence of their *See present edition, Vol.

 exploitation of the people’s labour, and which must belong to the people. 
 We are sure that the working peasants will declare a ruthless war against the kulaks, their oppressors, and will help us in our struggle for the people’s better futureand for socialism.

 Trotsky opposes the dispatch of a telegram with an offer of peace. 
 Comrade Lenin (speaking in favour of a peace offer). 
 Yesterday’s vote was especially characteristic, with every-one recognising the need for peace in the event of an offen-sive but no movement in Germany. 
 182 There is good cause to believe that the Germans want an offensive in order tooverthrow the Soviet Government. 
 We face a situation which calls for action. 
 If an imperialist offensive clearly gets under way, we shall then all be in favour of defence? and this can be explained to the people. 
 If an offensive gets under way now, and we explain this to the masses later, we shall create more confusion than if we now con-tinue negotiations for an extension of the armistice; thereis no time to lose in this because the masses will neverunderstand such an approach. 
 Either we wage a revolution-ary war for the socialisation of land, something the massescan understand, or we continue the peace negotiations.

 This is a basic question. 
 Uritsky’s pro-posal is amazing. 
 The Central Committee voted against a revolutionary war, but we have neither war nor peace,and are being drawn into a revolutionary war. 
 War is no joke. 
 We are losing railway cars, and our transport is break-ing down. 
 We cannot wait any longer because the situ-ation has fully crystallised. 
 The people will not understandthis: since there is a war on, there should have been no de-mobilisation; the Germans will now take everything. 
 Thisthing has gone so far that continued sitting on the fence will inevitably ruin the revolution. 
 Ioffe wrote from Brest that there was no sign of a revolution in Germany; if thatis so the Germans will find their advance very rewarding. 
We cannot afford to wait, which would mean consigning theRussian revolution to the scrap-heap. 
 If the Germans saidthat they wanted to overthrow Bolshevik power, we would naturally have to fight; no more procrastination is permissi-ble. 
 It is now no longer a matter of the past but of the pres-ent. 
 If we apply to the Germans, all we have is a piece ofpaper. 
 You can’t call that a policy. 
 The only thing we cando is offer the Germans a resumption of the talks. 
 There isno half-way house in this. 
 If it is to be revolutionary war it must be declared, and the demobilisation stopped, but we can’t go on in this manner. 
 While we engage in paperwork,they take warehouses and railway cars, leaving us to perish. 
 /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR The issue now is that while playing with war we have been surrendering the revolution to the Germans. 
 History will say that you have surrendered the revolution. 
 We could have concluded a peace which held no threat tothe revolution. 
 We have nothing, we have not even get thetime to blow up anything as we retreat. 
 We have done ourbest to help the revolution in Finland, but now we can dono more. 
 This is not the time for an exchange of notes, and this temporising must stop. 
 It is too late to put out feelers, because it is quite clear now that the Germans can launchan offensive. 
 We cannot argue against the advocates of arevolutionary war, but we can and must argue against thetemporisers. 
 An offer of peace must be made to the Germans. 
 2 Comrade Lenin . 
 Bukharin failed to notice how he went over to the position of a revolutionary war. 
 The peasantsdo not want war and will not fight. 
 Can we now tell thepeasants to fight a revolutionary war? But if that is what we want we should not have demobilised the army. 
 It is a utopia to want a permanent peasant war. 
 A revolutionarywar must not be a mere phrase. 
 If we are not ready, we mustconclude peace. 
 Since we have demobilised the army itis ridiculous to talk of a permanent war. 
 There is no compar-ison at all with a civil war. 
 The muzhik will not have a revolutionary war, and will overthrow anyone who openly calls for one. 
 The revolution in Germany has not yet start-ed, and we know that over here, too, our revolution didnot win out all at once. 
 It has been said here that theywould take Lifland and Estland; but we can give them up forthe sake of the revolution. 
 If they should want us to with-draw our troops from Finland, well and good—let them take revolutionary Finland. 
 The revolution will not be lostif we give up Finland, Lifland and Estland. 
 The prospectswith which Comrade Ioffe tried to scare us yesterday do notat all spell ruin to the revolution. 
 I propose a declaration that we are willing to conclude the peace the Germans offered us yesterday; should they add to this non-interference in the affairs of the Ukraine,Finland, Lifland and Estland, we should unquestionably accept all that as well. 
 Our soldiers are in a poor state; the Germans want grain, they will take it and go back, making it impossible for Soviet power to continue in exist-ence. 
 To say that the demobilisation has been stopped is tobe overthrown.

 XV of the Minutes DRAF T WIRELES S MESSAGE TO THE GOVERNMEN T OF THE GERMA N REIC H184 The Council of People’s Commissars lodges a protest over the German Government’s movement of troops against the Russian Soviet Republic, which had declared the state of war ended and had started to demobilise its army on allfronts. 
 The Workers’ and Peasants’ Government of Russiacould not have expected such a step, especially since neitherof the parties to the armistice had, directly or indirectly,made any announcement either on February 10, or at any other time, that the armistice was at an end, as both par-ties to the treaty of December 2 (15), 1917 had undertakento do. 
 The Council of People’s Commissars finds itself forced, in the situation that has arisen, to declare its readinessformally to conclude peace on the terms the German Govern-ment demanded at Brest-Litovsk. 
 At the same time, the Council of People’s Commissars expresses its readiness, if the German Government should formulate its precise peace terms, to reply within 12 hourswhether or not these terms are acceptable.

 To the first question Comrade Lenin replied: There is no army; the Germans are attacking from Riga along the entire front. 
 They have taken Dvinsk and Re-zhitsa and are on their way to Lutsk and Minsk. 
 Those whowant to do something—and stop talking—must concludepeace and continue the task of consolidating and extendingthe revolution at home. 
 To the second question: Until the offensives are stopped, an order has been issued to put up resistance wherever possible, and destroy every-thing, down to the last hunk of bread, all along the way. 
 To the third question: No, there was none.

 19 Socialist -Revolutionaries —a petty -bourgeois party founded in late 1901 and early 1902 through the merger of various Narodnik groups and circles (League of Socialist -Revolutionaries, Socialist -Revolutionary Party, etc. 
) which professed a hotch -potch of Narodnik and revisionist ideas. 
 During the First World War, most of its members held social -chauvinist views. 
 After the bourgeois -democratic revolution in February 1917, the Socialist -Revolutionaries, together with the Mensheviks, were the mainstay of the bourgeois -landowner Provisional Government, and the Party’s leaders (Avksentyev, Kerensky and Chernov) were in the Cabinet. 
 The Party refused to support the peasant demand for the abolition of landed estates and favoured the preservation of large holdings; its ministers in the Provisional Government sent punitive expeditions against peasants who seized tracts of large estates. 
 At the end of November 1917, the Left wing formed a separate party, which, in an effort to retain its influence among the peas -ants, went through the motions of recognising Soviet power andentered into an agreement with the Bolsheviks. 
 Very soon, how -ever, they began to fight against Soviet power. 
 During the foreign armed intervention and Civil War the Socialist -Revolutionaries engaged in subversion and gave active support to the interventionists and whiteguards; they took part in counter -revolutionary plots, and staged terroristic acts against Soviet Government and Communist Party leaders. 
 After the Civil War, they continued to engage in their hostile activity at home and among the whiteguard émigrés abroad.

 19 The All -Russia Democratic Conference was called by the Central Executive Committee of the Soviets, which was dominated by Mensheviks and Socialist -Revolutionaries, to decide on the ques -tion of state power, but its actual purpose was to switch the atten -tion of the masses away from the mounting revolutionary move -ment. 
 It was first set for September 12 (25), and later postponedto September 14 -22 (September 27 -October 5), 1917, when it was held in Petrograd and attended by more than 1,500 delegates. 
 The Menshevik and Socialist -Revolutionary leaders did their ut -most to reduce the number of workers’ and peasants’ delegatesand increase those of various petty -bourgeois and bourgeois groups, thereby securing a majority. 
 The Central Committee of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
(B. 
) met on Sep -tember 3 (16) and decided to take part. 
 It circulated a letter amonglocal Party organisations instructing them to “do their utmost to build up the largest possible well -knit group of delegates from among our Party members”. 
 The Bolsheviks decided to attend in order to expose the Mensheviks and the Socialist -Revolutiona -ries. 
 The tactics of the Bolsheviks in respect of the Democratic Conference were outlined by Lenin in two of his letters (see pp. 
 19 -21 and 22 -27. 
 The Democratic Conference adopted a resolution on the estab -lishment of a Pre -parliament (Caretaker Council of the Republic), which was an attempt to create the impression that Russia now had a parliamentary system. 
 Actually, according to the Provisional Government’s ordinance, the Pre -parliament was to be a consul -tative body under the Government. 
 A meeting of the Bolshevik delegates to the Democratic Confer-ence called by the Central Committee decided, by a vote of 77 to 50, to take part in the Pre -parliament. 
 In the articles on pp. 
 43 -51, 52 -58 and 74 -85, Lenin had some crit -icism to make of the Bolshevik tactics in respect of the DemocraticConference; he flatly demanded that the Bolsheviks should with -draw from the Pre -parliament and concentrate on preparing for the insurrection. 
 The Central Committee debated Lenin’s proposal4 5 6 7 8and adopted a resolution on the withdrawal of the Bolsheviks from the Pre -parliament despite resistance on the part of Kamenev, Rykov and other capitulants. 
 On October 7 (20), the opening day of the Pre -parliament, the Bolsheviks read out a declaration and walked out. 
 p. 
 19 The Provisional Government announced the convocation of the Constituent Assembly in its declaration of March 2 (15), 1917. 
 On June 14 (27) it adopted a decision setting the election for September 17 (30), but in August postponed the date to Novem -ber 12 (25). 
 The election was actually held after the October Socialist Revolution at the appointed time and on party lists drawn up before the revolution, in accordance with a Provisional Govern -ment ordinance. 
 At the time of the election the bulk of the peoplehad not yet realised the full implications of the socialist revolution, a fact which the Right Socialist -Revolutionaries used to win a majority in the areas remote from the capital and the industrial centres. 
 The Constituent Assembly was called by the Soviet Govern -ment and opened in Petrograd on January 5 (18), 1918. 
 Its counter -revolutionary majority rejected the Declaration of Rights of the Working and Exploited People , which was placed before it by the All-Russia Central Executive Committee, and refused to recognise Soviet power. 
 It was dissolved by a decree of the Central Executive Committee on January 6 (19).

 20 See Engels’s Revolution and Counter -Revolution in Germany which was published in instalments in the New York Daily Tribune in 1851 and 1852. 
 It bore Marx’s signature, who had intended to write the work but was too busy with his economic studies and asked Engels to do it. 
 Engels consulted Marx on various points and submitted the articles for his perusal before dispatching them to the paper. 
 The fact that the work was written by Engels came out later with the publication of their correspondence. 
 p. 
 21 Blanquism —a trend within the French socialist movement led by Louis Auguste Blanqui (1805 -1881), an outstanding utopian communist. 
 “Blanquism expects that mankind will be emancipat -ed from wage slavery, not by the proletarian class struggle, butthrough a conspiracy hatched by a small minority of intellectuals” (see present edition, Vol. 
 10, p. 
 392). 
 The trend failed to reckon with the concrete situation, which must be taken into account if an insurrection is to succeed, and neglected to establish ties with the masses. 
 p. 
 22 What Lenin has in mind are the mass demonstrations which took place in Petrograd on July 3 -4 (16 -17), 1917. 
 It was a movement of soldiers, sailors and workers, who were incensed at the Provi -sional Government for sending troops into a patently hopeless offensive which proved a fiasco. 
 It started on July 3 (16) with a demonstration by the First Machine -Gun Regiment in the Vy -borg District, and threatened to develop into an armed revoltagainst the Provisional Government. 
 The Bolshevik Party was opposed to insurrection at that time because it believed that the revolutionary crisis had not yet come to a head. 
 The Central Committee, meeting at 4. 
00 p. 
m. 
 on Ju -ly 3 (16), decided to refrain from taking action, and a similardecision was adopted by the Second Petrograd City Conference of Bolsheviks which was just then in session. 
 Its delegates went to the factories and the districts to stop the masses from going into action, but the movement had already got underway and nothing could be done to stop it. 
 Late that night, the Central Committee, together with the Petrograd Committee and the Military Organisation, took account of the mood of the masses and decided to take part in the demon -stration to lend it a peaceful and organised character. 
 Lenin wasaway on a short holiday after an exhausting stretch of work. 
 Being informed of the events, he returned to Petrograd on the morning of July 4 (17) and assumed leadership. 
 More than 500,000 persons took part in the demonstration on July 4 (17). 
 The demonstrators carried Bolshevik slogans, such as “All Power to the Soviets”, and demanded that the All -Russia Central Executive Committee of the Soviet should take power. 
 But the Socialist -Revolutionary and Menshevik leaders refused to do so. 
 The Provisional Government, with the knowledge and consent of the Central Executive Committee, which was dominated by the Mensheviks and Socialist -Revolutionaries, sent detachments of officer cadets and Cossacks to attack and shoot down the peace -ful demonstrators. 
 Counter -revolutionary troops were brought in from the front to disperse the demonstrations. 
 That night, Lenin presided at a meeting of members of the Central Committee and the Petrograd Committee, which adopted a decision to stop the demonstrations in an organised manner. 
 This was a wise step, for it helped to save the main revolutionary force from defeat. 
 The Mensheviks and Socialist -Revolutionaries acted in a manner which helped the counter -revolutionaries: they joined the bourgeoisie in attacking the Bolshevik Party. 
 The Bolshe -vik newspapers, Pravda , Soldatskaya Pravda (Soldiers’ Truth ) and others were closed down by the Provisional Government, while the Trud Printing House, operated on funds donated by the work -ers, was destroyed. 
 The workers were disarmed and arrested, and searches and persecution were started. 
 The revolutionary units of the Petrograd garrison were withdrawn from the capital and sent to the front. 
 After the July events, power in the country passed into the hands of the counter -revolutionary Provisional Government, with the Soviet an impotent appendage. 
 The period of dual power was at an end, and so was the revolution’s peaceful stage. 
 The Bolshe -viks were faced with the task of preparing an armed insurrectionto overthrow the Provisional Government.

 23 9 10 11The counter -revolutionary revolt of the bourgeoisie and the landowners in August 1917, which was headed by the Commander -in-Chief of the Army, the tsarist General Kornilov. 
 The plotters planned to take Petrograd, destroy the Bolshevik Party, disperse the Soviets and set up a military dictatorship with a view to restoring the monarchy. 
 Kerensky, the head of the Provisional Government, took part in the plot, but when the revolt got under way he real -ised that he would be swept away with Kornilov and washed hishands of the whole business: be declared the revolt was aimed against the Provisional Government. 
 It broke out on August 25 (September 7), with Kornilov send -ing the Third Cavalry Corps against Petrograd, where counter -revolutionary organisations were itching to go into action. 
 The mass struggle against Kornilov was led by the Bolshevik Party, which continued, as Lenin demanded, to expose the Provi -sional Government and its Socialist -Revolutionary and Menshevik accomplices. 
 The Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party rallied the workers of Petrograd, and the revolutionary soldiers and sailors to struggle against the mutineers. 
 Petrograd workers swiftly organised Red Guard units and revolutionary committees were set up in several places. 
 The advance of the Kornilov troops was stopped and their morale undermined by Bolshevik agitators. 
 The Kornilov revolt was crushed by the workers and peasants led by the Bolshevik Party. 
 Under the pressure of the masses, the Provisional Government was forced to order the arrest and prose -cution of Kornilov and his accomplices on charges of organisingthe revolt.

 23 Cadets (Constitutional -Democratic Party)—the leading party of the liberal -monarchist bourgeoisie in Russia, set up in October 1905. 
 Its membership was made up of capitalists, landowners serving on local councils and bourgeois intellectuals.

 Milyukov, S. 
 A. 
 Muromtsev, V. 
 A. 
 Maklakov, A.

 The Cadets eventually developed into a party of the imperialist bourgeoisie. 
 During the First World War they actively supported the tsarist government’s foreign policy of aggrandisement. 
 During the bour -geois -democratic revolution of February 1917, they tried to save the monarchy; playing a keg part in the bourgeois Provisional Government, they conducted a counter -revolutionary policy opposed to the people’s interests. 
 After the Great October Socialist Revolution they became rabid enemies of Soviet power and took part in all the counter -revolutionary military operations and the campaigns of the inter -ventionists. 
 After the defeat of the interventionists and whiteguards, the Cadets fled abroad to continue their anti -Soviet counter -revo -lutionary activity.

 It was closed down by the Revolutionary Military Committee of the Petrograd Soviet on October 26 (November 8), 1917. 
 It continued to be pub -lished until August 1918 under the names of Nasha Rech , Svobod -naya Rech , Vek, Novaya Rech , and Nash Vek .

 On April 20 (May 3), the newspapers carried a note from Foreign Minister Milyukov to the Allied Governments in which the Provisional Government reaf -firmed its intention to honour all the treaties of the tsarist govern -ment and to carry on the war to a victorious end. 
 There was mas -sive indignation over this imperialist policy, and on April 21(May 4), the workers of Petrograd responded to a call issued by the Bolshevik Party and downed tools. 
 They staged a demonstra -tion which demanded peace and was attended by more than100,000 workers and soldiers. 
 Protest demonstrations were also staged in Moscow, the Urals, the Ukraine, Kronstadt and other towns and districts. 
 Resolutions protesting against Milyukov’s note were received by the Petrograd Soviet from many urban Soviets. 
 The April demonstration led to a government crisis. 
 Mass pres -sure forced Milyukov and Guchkov to resign from the Cabinet. 
 Thefirst coalition government was formed on May 5 (18), and consisted of 10 capitalist ministers and leaders of the parties collaborating with them, namely, Kerensky and Chernov from the Socialist -Revolutionary Party; Tsereteli and Skobelev from the Mensheviks,etc. 
 The bourgeois government was saved by the Socialist -Revo -lutionaries and the Mensheviks who openly sided with the bour -p.

 It took a defencist attitude, collab -orated with the capitalists and supported the Provisional Govern -ment. 
 It resumed publication in Samara in October 1918 (four issues) and in Moscow in March 1919 (10 issues), and was closed down for counter -revolutionary activity. 
 p. 
 30 Proletarskoye Dyelo (Proletarian Cause)—a daily, the organ of the Bolshevik group of the Kronstadt Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies.

 p. 
 30 Pravda (Truth)—a legal Bolshevik daily; first issue out in Petersburg on April 22 (May 5), 1912. 
 Lenin provided Pravda with ideological direction, wrote for it almost daily, and issued instructions to its editors to make it a militant revolutionary newspaper. 
 A considerable part of the Party’s organisational effort was carried out in its editorial offices, where members of local Party cells held meetings, information was collected on Party activities at the factories, and Party directives of the Central and Petersburg Committees were issued. 
 Pravda was constantly harassed by the police and was closed down on July 8 (21), 1914. 
 It resumed publication after the bourgeois -democratic revolu -tion in February 1917. 
 On March 5 (18), 1917, it became the organof the Central Committee and the Petrograd Committee of the R.

 When Lenin returned to Petrograd he became a member of its editorial board and the newspaper launched a campaign for his plan of turning the bourgeois -democratic revolution in a so -cialist revolution. 
 Owing to the Provisional Government’s persecution, the paper appeared under various names, such as Listok Pravdy , Proletary , Rabochy and Rabochy Put between July and October 1917. 
 After the Great October Socialist Revolution, on October 29 (Novem -ber 9), 1917, the paper continued publication under its originalname.

(B. 
) together with delegates from the districts, army units, trade unions and factory committees. 
 The demonstration was to have shown the First All -Russia Congress of Soviets that the Petrograd workers and soldiers wanted the Soviets to take all state power. 
 The Menshe -viks and Socialist -Revolutionaries decided to prevent the demon -stration from taking place and pushed a resolution through the congress to that effect. 
 The Bolshevik Central Committee did not wish to oppose the Congress decision and at Lenin’s suggestion withdrew its decision on the night of June 9 (22). 
 Members of the Central Committee, Petrograd Committee, and Party activists went to the factories and barracks to convince the workers and soldiers to stay in. 
 Their efforts were successful and the workers and soldiers agreed that a demonstration would be badly timed. 
 The Menshevik and Socialist -Revolutionary leadership of the Congress of Soviets decided to stage a demonstration on June 18 (July 30) as an expression of confidence in the Provisional Govern -ment. 
 Lenin led the Central and Petrograd Committees in a great effort to prepare a demonstration showing the true feelings of the masses. 
 On the eve of the demonstration, June 17 (30), Pravda carried an appeal from the Central Committee, the Petrograd Com -mittee, the Central Committee’s Military Organisation, and theCentral Council of Factory Committees calling on the people to demonstrate the strength of the revolution. 
 Some 500,000 workers and soldiers took part in the demonstra -tion on June 18 (July 1), with the overwhelming majority carryingthe revolutionary slogans of the Bolshevik Party. 
 Only a small group carried the slogans of the collaborating parties, which urged support for the Provisional Government. 
 The demonstration showed the mounting revolutionary activity of the masses and the Bolshe -vik Party’s growing influence, it was a great victory for the Bolshe -vik Party. 
 It showed that the masses put no trust in the Provision -al Government, and the Menshevik and Socialist Revolutionarypolicy of collaborating with the bourgeoisie.

 The delegates of the Soviets came from the Menshevikand Socialist -Revolutionary parties. 
 Generals Kornilov, Alekseyev, Kaledin and others put forward a plan to crush the revolution. 
 Kerensky threatened to stamp out the revolutionary movement and use force against peasants who seized tracts of landed estates. 
 The Bolshevik Central Committee called on the proletariat to protest against the Moscow Conference. 
 In Moscow, the Bolsheviks staged a one -day general strike to mark its opening. 
 More than 22 23 24 25 26400,000 workers responded. 
 Protest meetings and strikes were also staged in other cities.

 37 Izvestia —a daily newspaper published from February 28 (March 13), 1917. 
 It was first issued by the Petrograd Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies. 
 Following the formation at the First All -Russia Congress of Soviets, of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies, the paper became the organ of the Executive, and from August 1 (14) (No. 
 132) was called the Izvestia of the Central Executive Committee and the Petrograd Soviet, and from September 29 (October 12) (No. 
 184), the Izvestia of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviets. 
 All this time the paper was under the control of the Mensheviks and Socialist -Revolutionaries and waged a fierce fight against the BolshevikParty. 
 After the Second All -Russia Congress of Soviets, the paper came under a new editorial board and became the official organ of the Soviet power. 
 It carried the first major documents adopted by the Soviet Government, and Lenin’s articles and speeches.

 p. 
 41 An abridged version of the article was first published in No. 
 19 of Rabochy Put of October 7 (September 24),1917, under the title “Heroes of Fraud”. 
 It did not contain the part of Lenin’s article which criticised the mistakes of the Bolsheviks in respect of the Democratic Conference, and also those of Zinoviev and Kamenev. 
 It may have been this Lenin had in mind when in Chapter VI of the article “The Crisis Has Matured”, which was circulated among members of the Central Committee, the Petrograd and Moscow Committees and the Soviets, he wrote with indignation that the Central Organ was deleting his statements about “the glaring errors on the part of the Bolsheviks...” (see p.

 43 On June 3 (16), 1907, the tsar issued a manifesto dissolving the Second State Duma and amending the electoral law. 
 The landowners, industrialists and merchants were given many more seats in the Duma, and the workers and peasants very many less. 
 This was a gross violation of the Manifesto of October 17, 1905, and the Fundamental Law of 1906, which made all Government decrees subject to Duma approval. 
 The Third Duma, which was elected under the new law and met on November 1 (14), 1907, was out -and-out reactionary.

 It consisted of six chapters, the last not being intended for publication but for circulation among members ofthe Central Committee, the Petrograd and Moscow Committees and the Soviets. 
 Only the manuscript of the last two chapters has come down to us. 
 The article was first published in four chaptersin Rabochy Put No.

 It was led by seamenMax Reichpietsch and Albin Köbis of the Friedrich der Grosse . 
 The organisation decided to fight for a democratic peace and pre -pare for an uprising. 
 Manifestations broke out in the navy inearly August. 
 Sailors of the warship Prinzeregent Luitpold , which was at Wilhelmshaven, took absence without leave to fight for therelease of their comrades who had earlier been arrested for staginga strike; on August 16, the firemen of the Westphalia refused to work; at the same time the crew of the cruiser Nürnberg , which was out at sea, staged an uprising. 
 The sailors’ movement spread to the ships of several squadrons at Wilhelmshaven . 
 These manifesta -tions were put down with great savagery.

 In an appeal,“Let’s Help the Railwaymen”, which was published in Rabochy Put (The Workers’ Path), the Central Committee exposed the counter -revolutionary policy of the Provisional Government and called on the proletariat to express full sympathy for the railwaymen, protect them from the provocative attacks of the counter -revolu -tionaries and do everything to prevent their strike from being isolated and defeated. 
 The strike ended on the night of Septem -ber 26 (October 9), 1917, when the Provisional Government satis -fied some of the railwaymen’s demands. 
 p. 
 81 The reference is to the attitude of Kamenev, Zinoviev, Trotsky and their followers. 
 Kamenev and Zinoviev opposed Lenin’s planfor an armed uprising, declaring that the working class of Russiawas incapable of carrying out a socialist revolution. 
 They sliddown to the Menshevik position of demanding a bourgeois repub -lic. 
 Trotsky insisted on a postponement of the uprising until the Second All -Russia Congress of Soviets, which meant frustrating the insurrection because this gave the Provisional Governmenta chance to concentrate its forces on the opening day of the Congressand crush the uprising.

 Lenin directedits policy from Paris and then from Cracow and Poronin; he editedsome of the articles and kept up a regular correspondence withmembers of the editorial board. 
 The magazine exposed opportunists—liquidators, otzovists and Trotskyites—and also bourgeois nationalists, and reported on the working -class struggle at the time of the new revolutionary upsurge; it popularised Bolshevik slogans in the electoral campaignfor the Fourth Duma and opposed revisionism and centrism inthe parties of the Second International. 
 It had a great part to playin educating forward -looking workers in Russia in the Marxist international spirit. 
 On the eve of the First World War, in June 1914 it was closed down by the tsarist government, and resumed publication in theautumn of 1917, but only one double issue was put out.

 Volodarsky and Lashevich had opposedLenin’s proposal for an armed uprising. 
 Lashevich said that the pace of developments should not be forced, and that it was best to wait for the Congress of Soviets. 
 They were rebuffed by Kalinin,Rahja, Lacis, and others. 
 The majority came out in favour of thearmed insurrection proposed in Lenin’s letter.

 On October 7 (20), the Moscow Committee adopted a resolution setting the task of launching an immediate campaign for power. 
 On October 10(23), a city conference of Moscow Bolsheviks adopted a resolutiondeclaring that only the overthrow of the Kerensky government andthe installation of a workers’ and peasants’ government couldallow the implementation of the following revolutionary measures: transfer of the land to the peasants; an offer of a just peace to the nations; and a resolute struggle against the dislocation. 
 The Confer -ence authorised the Moscow Committee to take steps to bring therevolutionary forces into a state of combat readiness. 
 p. 
 140 Written, when Lenin was in hiding, for the Extraordinary Party Congress set for October 17 (30), 1917, and the Third Petrograd City Conference of Bolsheviks. 
 The Congress was postponed bya decision of the Central Committee on October 5 (18), and thetheses were discussed at the City Conference. 
 66 67Third Petrograd City Conference of Bolsheviks was held from October 7 to 11 (20 -24), 1917, and was attended by 92 delegates with vote and 40 with voice but no vote. 
 Lenin was elected honorary chairman and the conference decisions were based on his theses. 
 In a resolution on the current political situation the Conference declared the need for replacing the Kerensky government with a revolutionary workers’ and peasants’ government which alone would hand the land to the peasants and take the country out of the war and the chaos. 
 Conference decisions stressed that the coun -try was on the eve of a mass proletarian uprising and expressedconfidence that it would win out. 
 It also discussed the question of elections to the Constituent Assembly, Lenin being among the Petrograd candidates. 
 On October 11 (24), the Conference also heard Lenin’s letter to the Petrograd City Conference (see pp. 
 145 -48). 
 The Conference had a very important part to play in the prepa -rations for the Great October Socialist Revolution. 
 p. 
 142 The Congress of Soviets of the Northern Region was initially to have taken place at Helsingfors on October 8 (21), 1917. 
 On October 5 (18), the Central Committee of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
(B. 
) decided it was to be held in Petrograd on October 10 (23). 
 It opened on October 11 (24) and closed on October 13 (26). 
 It was attended by 94 delegates, including 51 Bolsheviks, from Petrograd, Moscow, Novgorod, Staraya Russa, Borovichy, Revel, Yuriev, Archangel, Kronstadt, Gatchina, Tsarskoye Syelo, Sestroretsk, Vyborg, Helsingfors, etc. 
 The Menshevik group walked out when the Central Executive Committee of the Soviets, dominated by the Mensheviks and Socialist -Revolutionaries, declared that the Congress was not a plenipotentiary regional congress but a private conference of individual Soviets. 
 The items on its agenda were: (1) reports from the localities; (2) current political situation; (3) land ques -tion; (4) the country’s military and political position; (5) All -Russia Congress of Soviets; (6) Constituent Assembly; (7) organi -sational question. 
 Lenin attached great importance to the Congress. 
 On Octo -ber 8 (21) he wrote his “Letter to the Bolshevik Comrades Attendingthe Congress of Soviets of the Northern Region” (see pp. 
 182 -87), which was discussed by the Bolshevik group of the Congress on the morning of October 11 (24). 
 In its resolution on the current political situation, the Congress stressed that only an immediate transfer of power to the Soviets in the centre and in the provinces could save the country and the revolution. 
 The Congress adopted an appeal to the peasants, calling on them to support the prole -tariat in its struggle for power. 
 It elected a 17 -man Northern Regional Committee including 11 Bolsheviks and 6 Left Socialist -Revolutionaries. 
 Congress decisions had a great impact on thepreparation, organisation and rallying of all forces for the triumph of the Great October Socialist Revolution.

 He believed that the contradictions between labour and capi -tal could be resolved through reforms carried out by the PrussianJunker state. 
 He did not understand the origin of surplus value and the essence of the basic contradictions of capitalism and main -tained economic crises all came from low national consump -tion. 
 He said the fact that agriculture did without expenditure on raw materials gave rise to ground rent.

 160 Spartacus Group (Internationale )—a revolutionary organisation of German Left -wing Social -Democrats formed at the beginning of the First World War by Karl Liebknecht, Rosa Luxemburg, Franz Mehring, Clara Zetkin, Julian Marchlewski, Leo Jogiches (Tyszka) and Wilhelm Pieck. 
 The Theses on the Tasks of International Social -Democracy were written by Rosa Luxemburg, with the participation of Karl Lieb -knecht, Franz Mehring and Clara Zetkin, and were adopted by theall -Germany Conference of Left -wing Social -Democrats in Janu -ary 1916, where the group set up a formal organisation and adoptedthe name of Internationale . 
 From 1916, the International group, apart from political leaflets published in 1915, began the illegal publication and circu -lation of Political Letters , which were signed “Spartacus” (they were issued regularly until October 1918). 
 In view of this the Internationale group, too, assumed the name of Spartacus. 
 They carried on revolutionary propaganda in the masses, organised massive anti -war manifestations, directed strikes, and exposed the imperialist character of the world war and the treachery of the opportunist leaders of Social -Democracy. 
 But the Spartacus group made some grave errors on important questions of theory and policy: they denied the possibility of national -liberation wars in the epoch of imperialism, they were inconsistent on the slogan of turning the imperialist war into a civil war; they underrated the role of the proletarian party as the vanguard of the working class, and were afraid of breaking with the opportunists. 
 Lenin repeatedly criticised their mistakes and helped them to take a cor -rect attitude (see The Junius Pamphlet , The Military Programme of the Proletarian Revolution , etc. 
, in Vols. 
 22 and 23 of the present edition). 
 In April 1917, the Spartacus group were affiliated to the Cen -trist Independent Social -Democratic Party of Germany, but remai -ned organisationally independent. 
 During the November 1918 revolution in Germany they broke with the Independents and formed the Spartacusbund, issuing their own programme on Decem -ber 14, 1918. 
 At their Constituent Congress, December 30, 1918 -January 1, 1919, they set up the Communist Party of Germany. 
 p. 
 161 Tribunists —members of the Social -Democratic Party of Holland, whose organ was the newspaper Tribune. 
 They were led by Wijn -koop, Gorter, Pannekoek and Roland -Holst. 
 They were not a con -sistently revolutionary party but were on the Left wing of the working -class movement in Holland, and on the whole took an internationalist attitude during the First World War. 
 In 1918, they formed the Communist Party of Holland. 
 p. 
 175 The Socialist Propaganda League was formed in Boston, U. 
S. 
A. 
, in 1915, as an independent group within the Socialist Party. 
 It adopted the platform of the Zimmerwald Left, and rallied the revolutionary elements of the Socialist Party. 
 After the October Revolution the League set up a Committee for Bolshevik Infor -mation, which exposed the lies and slander of bourgeois and reform -ist periodicals about the Soviet Republic. 
 During the Allied armed intervention against Russia the League campaigned under the slogan of “Hands Off Soviet Russia!”. 
 p. 
 175 Socialist Labour Party of America —set up in Philadelphia in 1876 at the unifying congress of the American sections of the First International and other Socialist organisations. 
 The overwhelming majority of the party consisted of foreign -born Americans who had few ties with native workers. 
 In its first few years, it was led by the Lassalleans, who made sectarian and dogmatic errors. 
 Some of the party’s leaders believed it should concentrate on par -liamentary activity and underestimated the importance of leadingthe massive economic struggle; others slid down to trade -unionism and anarchism. 
 These ideological and tactical mistakes on the part of the leadership weakened the party and led to splits. 
 Marx and Engels sharply criticised the sectarian tactics of the U. 
S. 
 Socialists. 
 By the nineties, the Left wing led by Daniel de Leon, assumed leadership of the party. 
 But they, too, made mistakes of an anarch -73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80ist and syndicalist nature. 
 They refused to fight for the partial demands of the working class, and shied away from activity in reformist trade unions, and this lost them what ties they had with the mass labour movement. 
 During the First World War, the Socialist Labour Party inclined to internationalism. 
 Under the influence of the Great October Socialist Revolution, its more revolutionary members took part in setting up the Communist Party of the United States. 
 At present, the Socialist Labour Party is a small group without any influence on the U. 
S. 
 labour move -ment.

 The workers struck the following day, and a general strike followed. 
 Barricades were thrown up. 
 The movement assumed a political, anti -war character. 
 On August 23, Turin’s suburbs were in the hands of the insurgents. 
 The Govern -ment threw the army against them and imposed martial law.

P. 
 on Octo -ber 10 (23), 1917 , was the first one Lenin attended after his return to Petrograd from Vyborg. 
 Sverdlov was in the chair. 
 Lenin gave a report on the current situation. 
 The Central Committee adopted the resolution motioned by Lenin who proposed immediate prep -arations for an armed uprising. 
 Only Zinoviev and Kamenevvoted against the proposal. 
 Trotsky abstained, but he held that it had to be postponed until the Second Congress of Soviets, which in practice meant bungling the insurrection and allowing the Provisional Government to pull up its forces to crush the uprising on the day the Congress opened. 
 The Central Committee rebuffed the capitulants. 
 The October 10 meeting of the Central Committee is of tremendous historical importance. 
 The resolution on the uprising adopted by 10 to 2 became the Bolshevik Party’s direc -tive in starting immediate preparations for an insurrection. 
 Todirect the insurrection, the Central Committee set up a Political Bureau headed by Lenin. 
 p. 
 188 The reference is to Sverdlov’s report to the Central Committee on October 10 (23), 1917, on the third item of the agenda: “Minsk and the Northern Front”. 
 He said that there was a technical possi -bility of staging an armed uprising in Minsk, and that Minsk hadoffered to send a revolutionary corps to help Petrograd.

 It heard Lenin’s report on the C. 
C. 
 October 10 (23) resolution calling for an armed uprising. 
 Kamenev and Zinoviev once again opposed the idea of an insurrection on the plea that the Bolsheviks were not strong enough and should await the Constituent Assembly. 
 The resolu -tion was resolutely supported by Dzerzhinsky, Kalinin Rahja,Sverdlov, Skrypnik and others who sharply criticised Kamenev’s and Zinoviev’s back -tracking. 
 Lenin’s resolution was adopted by 19 votes to 2, with four abstentions. 
 A closed meeting of the Cen -tral Committee set up a Revolutionary Military Centre to directthe insurrection. 
 It was to be a part of the Soviet Revolutionary Military Committee. 
 p. 
 191 A reference to the enlarged Central Committee meeting on Octo -ber 16 (29), 1917. 
 Lenin remained in hiding in Petrograd and changed the date of the meeting to October 15 (28) in order to conceal his presence at the meeting; for reasons of secrecy he referred to a comrade who had allegedly informed him of the meeting. 
 p. 
 195 The peasant movement in Tambov Gubernia in September 1917 assumed great proportions: the peasants seized tracts of landed estates, destroyed and burned landowners’ mansions and confis -cated grain stocks. 
 In September, 82 landowners’ estates were destroyed in 68 gubernias and regions, including 32 in Tambov Gubernia. 
 Altogether there is a record of 166 peasant manifesta -tions in the gubernia, especially in Kozlov Uyezd. 
 The frightenedlandowners took their grain to the railway stations in an effort to sell it, so that the railway junctures were literally swamped with grain. 
 The commanding officer of the Moscow Military District sent military units to Tambov Gubernia to crush the peasant upris -ing, and imposed martial law, but the peasants’ revolutionarystruggle for land continued to grow in scope.

 It changed political 87colours a number of times, and from 1905 became the organ of the Black Hundreds. 
 After the bourgeois -democratic revolution of February 1917, it took a counter -revolutionary attitude and con -ducted a rabid campaign against the Bolsheviks. 
 Closed down bythe Revolutionary Military Committee of the Petrograd Soviet on October 26 (November 8), 1917. 
 Lenin said it was an example of the corrupt press. 
 p. 
 211 This and the letter on pp. 
 223 -27 are a reflection of Lenin’s struggle against Kamenev and Zinoviev, who tried to frustrate the C.

 de -cision on an armed uprising. 
 They were defeated at the CentralCommittee meeting on October 10 (23), 1917, which discussed the question of an uprising, and on the next day sent the C.

 Having failed to rally support at an enlarged meet -ing of the Petersburg Committee on October 15 (28), which heard their letter and the enlarged meeting of the Central Committee on October 16 (29), where they again spoke against any armed uprising Kamenev and Zinoviev stooped to downright treason. 
 On October 18 (31), the semi -Menshevik newspaper, Novaya Zhizn , carried an item entitled: “Kamenev about the ‘Uprising’”, in which the author, on behalf of Zinoviev and himself argued against the armed uprising and incidentally gave away a most important secret Party decision to the enemy. 
 That same day, Lenin wrote his first letter (p. 
 216) and the next day the second (p. 
 223), branding the move as betrayal of the revolution. 
 He called the two men strike -breakers and demanded their expulsion from the Party. 
 Lenin’s letter was discussed by the Central Committee on October 20 (November 2), when Dzerzhinsky, who spoke first, motioned that “Kamenev should withdraw from political activity entirely”. 
 As for Zinoviev, he said, he was in hiding from the authorities and was not participating in any Party activity any -way. 
 Sverdlov said Kamenev’s act could have no justificationwhatever, but the Central Committee was not authorised to expel members from the Party. 
 He suggested that Kamenev should resign from the Central Committee. 
 Stalin spoke twice. 
 He first proposed that the discussion should be transferred to a C. 
C. 
 ple -nary meeting, and when the proposal was voted down, he declaredthat “expulsion from the Party was no remedy”. 
 He proposed that Zinoviev and Kamenev should be left in the C. 
C. 
 and should be bound to abide by C. 
C. 
 decisions. 
 Kamenev was removed from the C. 
C. 
, and both were forbidden to make any statement against decisions of the C. 
C. 
 and its poli -cies. 
 It was also decided that members of the C. 
C. 
 should be prohib -ited from making public statements against decisions passed by the C.

 216 The Third Zimmerwald Conference took place at Stockholm from September 5 to 12, 1917.

 Vorovsky and N. 
 A. 
 Semashko. 
 The Conference examined the Grimm Affair. 
 Grimm had been exposed in Russia as an emissary of the Swiss Minister Hoffmann, who was putting out feelers for a separate peace treaty in the interests of German imperialism. 
 By that time Grimm had been relieved of his post of Chairman of the International Socialist Committee; the Conference approved his expulsion from the I. 
S. 
C. 
, declaring that his behaviour had been inadmissible, a measure Lenin considered inadequate. 
 During the discussion of the attitude the Socialists of the Second International took to the Stockholm Peace Conference, some delegates came out in favour of participation, while the Russian Mensheviks were given an imperative mandate to remain at the Zimmerwald Conference only on condition that it would participate in the Stockholm Conference in toto . 
 On behalf of the R.

(B. 
) Central Committee and its Bureau Abroad and Polish Social -Democrats, the Mensheviks and their followers were sharply criticised by Vorovsky who demanded a resolution on the state of affairs in Russia. 
 However, the Centrist majority of the Conference refused to adopt such a resolution on the plea that they were not sufficiently well informed about Russian affairs. 
 The conference manifesto called on workers of all countries to stage a general strike against war, but it did not reflect any of the revolutionary Social -Democratic slogans on turning the imperial -ist war into a civil war and fighting for a defeat of the home govern -ment in each belligerent country. 
 The Third Zimmerwald Confer -ence bore out Lenin’s conclusion that the Zimmerwald Associa -tion had gone bankrupt and that there was need to break with it immediately and set up a Third, Communist, International. 
 The Third Zimmerwald Conference was the last one held by the Association.

 Seven volumes were published from December 1917 to February 1918. 
 By publishing the secret treaties, the Soviet Government’s revolutionary propaganda struck a great blow for a general democratic peace, without annexations and indemnities, and exposed the imperialist nature of the First World War.

 FourteenBolsheviks were elected to the Presidium, among them Lenin, Antonov -Ovseyenko, Krylenko and Lunacharsky; seven Socialist -Revolutionaries including Kamkov, Karelin and Spiridonova,and one member of the Ukrainian Socialist Party. 
 The Mensheviks and the Right Socialist -Revolutionaries declined to sit on the Presidium. 
 The leaders of the Menshevik and the Socialist -Revolu -tionary Right wing motioned that negotiations should be startedwith the Provisional Government to set up a coalition government, because, they said, the socialist revolution then under way was nothing but a plot. 
 When they saw that the majority supported the Bolsheviks, they walked out (they were joined by Bund dele -gates).

 249 The Anti -Socialist Law was introduced in Germany in 1878 by the Bismarck Government to fight the working -class and socialist movement. 
 It outlawed all Social -Democratic organisations, work -ing-class associations, the working -class press, and provided for the confiscation of socialist literature. 
 Social -Democrats were harassed and deported. 
 However these reprisals failed to break down the Social -Democratic Party, which adapted itself to under -ground activity: its central organ, Sozial -Demokrat was published abroad, and it held regular party congresses (1880, 1883 and 1887). 
 Underground Social -Democratic organisations and groups were rapidly revived at home and operated under a Central Committee in hiding. 
 At the same time, the Party used various legal means of strengthening its ties with the masses and its influence grew steadily: from 1878 to 1890, the number of votes it polled in the Reichstag elections more than tripled. 
 Marx and Engels gave the German Social -Democrats a great deal of help. 
 In 1890, the Anti -Socialist Law was lifted as a result of mass pressure and the mount -ing working -class movement.

 259 The Law on Workers ’ Control was drafted right after the revolution. 
 Lenin’s Draft Regulations on Workers’ Control, which he wrote102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR on October 26 or 27 (November 8 or 9), 1917, was discussed and in the main adopted by a meeting at the Petrograd Central Council of Factory Committee, at which Lenin was present. 
 On October 27, the draft was placed before the Council of People’s Commissars, which authorised Milyutin and Larin to draw up detailed Draft Regulations on Workers’ Control within two days. 
 But their draft clashed with the tasks of revolutionary workers’ control formulated by Lenin; for instance, it did not contain the most important clause making decisions of workers’ control bodies binding on factory owners. 
 Lenin’s draft was then taken as a basis for the law on workers’ control. 
 It was amended and published in Gazeta Vremennogo Rabochego i Krestyanskogo Pravitelstva (Gazette of the Provisional Workers’ and Peasants’ Government ) No. 
 3, of November 1 (14), under the title: “Draft Law on Workers Con -trol (Submitted to the Labour Commission)”. 
 In the subsequentdiscussion, it was proposed that workers’ control bodies setup in the localities should be replaced by government bodies, and that workers’ control should be introduced only at the major factories, railways, etc. 
 Lenin won his point that workers’ control should be introduced everywhere to stimulate the workers’ initia -tive. 
 The final drafting of the decree was assigned to a commissionof the All -Russia Central Executive Committee appointed on November 8 (21). 
 On November 14 (27) the All -Russia Central Executive Committee examined the commission’s draft and is -sued the decree which is known as “Regulations on Workers’Control”, and contains the basic provisions of Lenin’s draft. 
 The decree was published in Izvestia No.

 270 Left Socialist -Revolutionaries —the party of Left Socialist -Revolu -tionaries (internationalists); formed at its First All -Russia Con -gress held from November 19 to 28 (December 2 to 11), 1917. 
 Until then they had existed as a Left wing of the Socialist -Revolutionary Party, which took shape during the First World War. 
 They were headed by Spiridonova, Kamkov and Natanson (Bobrov). 
 The Left wing grew rapidly after the July 1917 events (see Note 8) and this was a reflection of the shift to the Left among the peas -ants. 
 In August, the Left Socialist -Revolutionaries secured110 111 control of the newspaper Znamya Truda (see Note 54), which subsequently became the Central Organ of their Party. 
 At the Second All -Russia Congress of Soviet, the Left Socialist -Revolutionaries constituted a majority of the Socialist -Revolu -tionary group, which split up on the question of participation in the Congress; the Right Socialist -Revolutionaries, acting on directives of their Party’s Central Committee, left the Congress, while the Left Socialist -Revolutionaries remained and voted with the Bolsheviks on the major items of the agenda. 
 The Bolsheviks believed that a bloc should be formed with the Left Socialist -Revolutionaries, who at that time had a considerable followingamong the peasants. 
 Accordingly, they invited them to enter the Soviet Government, but they refused and insisted on the demand to set up a so -called “uniform socialist government” with the partic -ipation of the Mensheviks, Right Socialist -Revolutionaries and other parties and groups. 
 After considerable hesitation, the Left Socialist -Revolutionaries, intent on retaining their influence among the peasants, agreed to collaborate with the Bolsheviks. 
 As a result of the talks held in late November and early December 1917, an agreement was reached on their participation in the Government. 
 They committed themselves to follow the common policy of the Council of People’s Commissars, and were made members of several collegiums of People’s Commissariats. 
 While collaborating with the Bolsheviks, the Left Socialist -Revolutionaries took wrong attitudes on vital aspects of socialistconstruction and opposed the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
 In January and February 1918, their Central Committee launched a campaign against the conclusion of the Treaty of Brest -Litovsk, and when it was signed and ratified by the Fourth Congress of Soviets in March, they withdrew from the Government, but continu -ed to take part in the collegiums and local organs of power. 
In July, their Central Committee organised the assassination of the German Ambassador Mirbach in Moscow and an armed revolt against Soviet power in the hope of sabotaging the peace treaty and provoking war between Soviet Russia and Germany. 
 The Fifth All -Russia Congress of Soviets, held after the suppression of the July revolt, decided to expel Left Socialist -Revolutionaries who shared the views of their leadership from the Soviets. 
 Having lost all support among the masses, the party of Left Socialist -Revolutionaries launched an armed fight against Soviet power. 
Some of the Left Socialist -Revolutionaries who wanted to collab -orate with the Bolsheviks formed a party of Narodnik Commu -nists and Revolutionary Communists, and a considerable number of them later joined the Communist Party. 
 p. 
 270 The reference is to the Bolsheviks’ participation in a conference called by the Vikzhel for talks on the composition of the govern -ment. 
 The Vikzhel, the All -Russia Central Committee of the Rail -waymen’s Trade Union which was dominated by the Mensheviksand Socialist -Revolutionaries, was one of the bulwarks of the112 counter -revolution after the victory of the October insurrection in Petrograd. 
 On October 29 (November 11), 1917 it adopted a res -olution calling for a so -called “uniform socialist government”, consisting of representatives of all parties, from the Bolsheviks to the Popular Socialists. 
 The Conference on the composition of the government opened on the same day and was attended by Menshe -vik defencists, Menshevik internationalists, Right Socialist -Revolutionaries, Left Socialist -Revolutionaries, and members of the Postal Union, the Petrograd Duma, the Executive Committee of the Soviet of Peasants’ Deputies, etc. 
 The Bolshevik Central Committee decided to attend stating that any talks on the enlarge -ment of the government and the All -Russia Central Executive Committee could take place only on the basis of the programme for Soviet power adopted by the Second Congress of Soviets. 
 Kamenev and Sokolnikov were authorised by the Central Com -mittee to attend. 
 The All -Russia Central Executive Committee also sent its representatives to the Conference, among whom was Ryazanov. 
 The Mensheviks and the Socialist -Revolutionaries expected to play the leading part in any coalition government and to use it to fight the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
 In the Co -ordinating Committee set up by the Conference, they demanded that resist -ance to Kerensky’s troops be stopped and insisted that the All -Russia Central Executive Committee should be replaced by a People’s Council which would have a majority of members representing the Executive Committee of the All -Russia Soviet of Peasants’ Deputies City councils and other organisations which they had under control. 
 They proposed the establishment of a new govern -ment headed by Chernov or Avksentyev. 
 The Bolshevik delegateswho attended took a conciliatory attitude and did not object to discussing the proposals tabled by the Mensheviks and the Social -ist-Revolutionaries. 
 The Bolshevik Central Committee discussed the question of negotiations with the Vikzhel and the behaviour of the Bolshevik delegates on November 1 (14). 
 The majority censured the policy of conciliation and proposed that the talks should either be broken off or formulated as an ultimatum. 
 Kamenev, Milyutin, Rykov and Ryazanov insisted on a continuation of the talks. 
 A C. 
C. 
 reso -lution said the parties of conciliation were negotiating to subvertSoviet power, and the C. 
C. 
 therefore authorised Bolshevik repre -sentatives to attend the talks with the sole aim of exposing thefutile attempts to set up a coalition government, and terminating the talks. 
 The All -Russia Central Executive Committee discussed the progress of the talks on the night of November 1 (14) and adopt -ed a Bolshevik resolution drawn up in the spirit of the C. 
C. 
 deci -sion of November 1 (14). 
 However, the opposition group of Kame -nev, Zinoviev, Rykov, Milyutin, Larin, Ryazanov and others,who took a Right -wing opportunist stand, opposed their line to that of the Central Committee and fought against the C. 
C. 
 decision. 
 On November 2 (15), the C. 
C. 
 adopted a resolution on the opposition within the C. 
C. 
 (see pp. 
 277 -79). 
 At the All -Russia Central Executive Committee meeting on the night of November 2 (15), following the speeches of the Left Socialist -Revolutionaries who demanded a review of the Committee’s deci -sion on the terms of an agreement, Kamenev and Zinoviev pushed through a resolution which clashed with that of the Central Com -mittee adopted earlier. 
 Their resolution provided for a changein the composition of the government and gave the Bolsheviks only half the government posts. 
 The opposition voted for this resolution. 
 Following the ultimatum which the majority of the Central Committee presented to the opposition minority (see pp. 
 280 -82) on November 3 (16), Kamenev, Zinoviev, Rykov, Milyutin and Nogin withdrew from the Central Committee, while the last three and Teodorovich resigned from their posts of People’s Commissars. 
 They were joined by Ryazanov, Larin and several others. 
 On November 5 or 6 (18 or 19), the Central Committee once again demanded in the form of an ultimatum that Kamenev, Zinoviev, Ryazanov and Larin should stop their disrupting tactics (they had come out against the C. 
C. 
 decisions in non -Party organi -sations) (see p. 
 302). 
 On November 7 (20), the Central Committeepublished in Pravda an appeal to all members of the Party and all working classes of Russia, branding the opposition as deserters of the revolution who had abandoned the principles of Bolshevism (see pp. 
 304 -08). 
 p. 
 276 Written by Lenin in connection with a discussion of the matter by the All -Russia Central Executive Committee on Novem -ber 4 (17), 1917. 
 On October 26 (November 8), 1917, the Revolutionary Military Committee took a decision to close down a number of bourgeois newspapers— Rech , Dyen and others—for their counter -revolu -tionary propaganda. 
 The Decree on the Press was adopted by the Council of People’s Commissars the next day. 
 On November 4 (17) the All -Russia Central Executive Committee discussed the question of the press, with Larin and the Left Socialist -Revolutionaries— Kolegayev, Karelin, Proshyan and others—opposing the decree. 
 Lenin spoke in favour of the measures taken by the Revolu -tionary Military Committee and the Government (see pp. 
 285 -87). 
 By a majority of 34 to 24, with 1 abstention, the All -Russia Cen -tral Executive Committee adopted a Bolshevik resolution voicingunconditional support for the Government’s policy on the press. 
 The resolution drafted by Lenin was not tabled at the meeting. 
 p. 
 283 The question was addressed to Lenin, as the Chairman of the Council of People’s Commissars, at a meeting of the All -Russia Central Executive Committee on November 4 (17), 1917, in con -nection with the issue of several decrees by the Council of People’sCommissars without the sanction of the All -Russia Central Execu -tive Committee. 
 Having heard Lenin’s explanations, the LeftSocialist -Revolutionary group declared them to be unsatisfac -tory. 
 Uritsky tabled a resolution on behalf of the Bolshevik group113 114 expressing full confidence in the Government. 
 Before the vote on the resolution, the Left Socialist -Revolutionaries declared that the People’s Commissars, being parties in interest, should not take part in the voting. 
 A majority of the All -Russia Central Executive Committee passed a resolution approving the Govern -ment’s activity.

 1 of November 1 (14), 1917, issued by the officer in command of the troops defending Petrograd, Muravyov, calling on the soldiers, sailors and Red Guardsmen to deal ruth -lessly with any criminal elements. 
 Because his wording couldlead to undesirable consequences the All -Russia Central Executive Committee on November 2 (15) asked the People’s Commissariat of the Interior to rescind it. 
 p. 
 290 Lenin is referring to a speech by the Left Socialist -Revolutionary G. 
 D. 
 Zaks in defence of the Right -wing opportunist attitude of Nogin, Rykov, Milyutin and others on the issue of setting up a “uniform socialist government”. 
 He said he feared the socialist revolution in Russia would be left in isolation because Western Europe was disgracefully silent.

 On various sectors divisions, corps and armies, and even entire fronts (e. 
g.

 These so -called “soldiers’ peace treaties” re -mained in force until the conclusion of a general armistice. 
 p. 
 312 The Congress was called by a decision of the All -Russia Central Executive Committee and met in Petrograd from November 10 to 25 (November 23 to December 8), 1917. 
 Attempts were made by the Right Socialist -Revolutionary Executive Committee of the Soviets of Peasants’ Deputies (elected by the First All -Russia Congress of Peasants’ Deputies in May 1917) to prevent the Con -gress from meeting and the peasant delegates from coming intocontact with the Bolsheviks. 
 These attempts were foiled by the vigorous efforts of the Bolsheviks, who were supported by grass roots delegates and the Left Socialist -Revolutionary minority of the peasant Executive. 
 About 260 delegates attended the first sitting, on November 18 (December 1) there were 330 delegates with vote, including 195 Left Socialist -Revolutionaries, 37 Bolsheviks, 65 Socialist -Revolu -tionaries of the Right and Centre, and more were arriving. 
 The Congress was the scene of a sharp struggle between the Right and Left wing, with the Right -wingers eventually walking out. 
 The Bolsheviks’ fight against the Right Socialist -Revolutiona -ries was hampered by the vacillation of the Left -wingers. 
 The resolution “On Power” tabled by the Left Socialist -Revolutiona -ries contained the Socialist -Revolutionary and Menshevik demand for a government of all socialist parties, from Popular Socialists to the Bolsheviks, inclusive. 
 But in that same resolution the Congress stated that the government was being set up to implement the programme of the Second Congress of Soviets. 
 It also provided for a merger of the Executive of the Soviets of Peasants’ Depu -ties with the All -Russia Central Executive Committee. 
 The Right -wingers failed in their efforts to split the Congress. 
 On November 15 (28) it discussed and approved the Presidium’s report on the terms for the merger worked out jointly with the Presidium of the All -Russia Central Executive Committee, on whose behalf Sverdlov delivered a speech of greetings. 
 The Congress then moved as a body to Smolny, where at 6. 
00 p. 
m. 
 a ceremonial joint sitting was held by the All -Russia Central Executive Commit -tee, the Extraordinary Congress of Soviets of Peasants’ Deputiesand the Petrograd Soviet. 
 It heard a report on the merger of the All -Russia Central Executive Committee and the Executive Committee elected by the Congress, and adopted a resolution confirming the decrees of the Second Congress of Soviets on peace and on land, and the decree of the All -Russia Central Executive Committee on workers’ control. 
123 124 The Congress adopted a resolution on the agrarian question which was tabled by the Left Socialist -Revolutionaries and was based on the principle of equalitarian land tenure. 
 The Congress authorised the Presidium to open the Second All-Russia Congress of Soviets of Peasants’ Deputies on Novem -ber 26 (December 9). 
 The delegates to the Extraordinary Congresswere incorporated in the Second Congress. 
 Lenin spoke three times in explanation of the Bolshevik atti -tude to the agrarian question and the terms of agreement withthe Left Socialist -Revolutionaries. 
 His speeches were of tremen -dous importance in guiding the Congress and rallying its Leftwing. 
 p. 
 321 Written in connection with the Left Socialist -Revolutionaries’ objections to the Bolshevik demand that Lenin should be invited to speak at the Congress in his capacity of Chairman of the Council of People’s Commissars. 
 They thought this would be prejudicial to the issue of power. 
 On their motion, the Congress rejected the Bolshevik proposal, and Lenin addressed it as a member of the Bolshevik group. 
 p. 
 323 The reference is to the instruction to the volost land committees approved by the First All -Russia Congress of Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies on June 23 (July 6), 1917, and published as a law “On the Volost Committees” on November 3 (16), 1917. 
 p. 
 325 The reference is to the start of the peace talks with Germany. 
 Following the publication of the Decree on Peace, adopted by the Second All -Russia Congress of Soviets, the Soviet Govern -ment took practical steps to conclude a general democratic peaceamong the belligerents. 
 On November 7 (20), 1917, it issued spe -cial directions to General Dukhonin, the Commander -in-Chief, ordering him to make an offer to the enemy command to stop military operations and open peace talks. 
 The directions said the government deemed it necessary to make a formal proposal for an armistice between the belligerents without delay ( Izvestia No. 
 221, November 10, 1917). 
 But the counter -revolutionary top brass, who had contacts with the military missions of the Entente, blocked the armistice in every possible way. 
 On November 8 (21), the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs sent a note to the Allied ambassadors proposing an immediate ceasefire on all fronts and negotiations on peace. 
 The Entente ambassadors met at the U. 
S. 
 Embassy in Petrograd on November 9 (22) and decided to ignore the Soviet Government’s note. 
 The refusal of the Entente imperialists to support the Soviet Government’s peace initiative and their active resistance to the conclusion of a peace, forced the Council of People’s Commissars to start separate peace talks with Germany. 
 On November 14 (27), word was received that the German High Command was prepared to start armistice talks. 
 On the Soviet Government’s proposal the125 126 127 talks were postponed for five days to give the Allied Governments another chance to make known their attitude on the peace propos -al. 
 On November 15 (28), the Soviet Government issued itsappeal to the governments and peoples of all the belligerent coun -tries urging them to join in the peace negotiations. 
 There was noreply from the Allied powers. 
 On November 19 (December 2), a Soviet peace delegation led by A. 
 A. 
 Ioffe arrived in the neutral zone and proceeded to Brest -Litovsk, where it met a delegation of the Austro -Hungarian bloc which included representatives of Bulgaria and Turkey. 
 A 10 -day ceasefire was arranged as a result of the talks of November 20 -22 (December 3 -5). 
 The Soviet Government took the opportunity to try to turn the separate talks with Germany into negotiations for a general democratic peace. 
 On November 24 (December 7) it sent another note to the Entente ambassadors inviting them to join in the talks. 
 This note was also ignored. 
 On December 2 (15), the talks were resumed and that same day a 28 -day ceasefire was agreed upon. 
 It provided for a peace conference, which opened at Brest -Litovsk on December 9 (22). 
 p. 
 325 Placed before the All -Russia Central Executive Committee on November 21 (December 4), 1917, by the Bolshevik group. 
 The need for such a decree was substantiated by Lenin (see pp. 
 338 -40). 
 The right of recall was in principle upheld by a majority of the Committee; two members voted against, and one abstained. 
 The draft was referred to a Co -ordinating Committee with the partici -pation of Left Socialist -Revolutionaries. 
 It introduced amendments to Lenin’s draft, in which the right to appoint elections was vested in congresses of Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’ Deputies (instead of the Soviets themselves), while the Soviets were empowered to appoint elections upon the demand of more than half the electorate in a given electoral district. 
 The draft worked out by the Co -ordinating Committee was unanimously adopted by the All -Russia Central Executive Committee and published in Izvestia No.

 Under it several peasants’ and army congresses passed deci -sions recalling deputies from the Constituent Assembly.

 On its agenda were the following items: the current situation and the question of power; the activity of the Central Committee of the Navy; reforms in the Navy Department, etc. 
 It was addressed by Lenin, who spoke on the current situation. 
 It discussed the activity of Tsentroflot which had betrayed its electors, and endorsed the128 129 130 activity of the Revolutionary Naval Committee which had dis -solved Tsentroflot. 
 It approved the organisational scheme for the administration of the Navy Department, and elected 20 men to the All -Russia Central Executive Committee of the Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’ Deputies. 
 The Congress sent a message of greetings to the Council of People’s Commissars and an appeal to the whole of Russia.

 Rasputin was killed in Petrograd by a group of monarchists who tried to save the dynasty and stifle the growing revolution. 
 p. 
 345 Written, it would appear, in connection with the discussion by the Soviet Government on November 27 (December 10), 1917, of instructions to the Soviet delegation empowered to negotiate a peace with Germany at the peace conference at Brest -Litovsk. 
 The government decision on this question said: “Instruction on the Talks, on the Basis of the Decree on Peace. 
” The peace conference opened on December 9 (22), 1917, and was attended by the Soviet delegation and those of the Quadruple Alliance (Germany, Austria -Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey). 
 At the first sitting the Soviet delegation read out a declaration on the peace terms. 
 The other side appeared to agree to conduct the talks on these terms, but in fact this preliminary period already revealed Germany’s annexationist intentions. 
 On January 5 (18), the delegates of the Quadruple Alliance made known their govern -ments’ territorial claims to the Soviet delegation. 
 This includeda part of Russia which was to be ceded to Germany and Austria -Hungary (a territory of more than 150,000 square kilometres):Poland, Lithuania, a part of Estonia and Latvia, and also sizable areas inhabited by Ukrainians and Byelorussians. 
 Despite the clearly predatory nature of the terms put forward by the German imperialists, Lenin insisted on the conclusion of peace because he believed a breathing space was necessary to build up Soviet power in view of the general war -weariness and disloca -tion and the army’s low morale, any continuation of the warwould be fatal to Soviet power. 
 This attitude was opposed by Trotsky and a group of Left Communists, including Bukharin, Lomov (Oppokov), Ioffe, Pyatakov and Osinsky (Obolensky), who insisted on breaking off the talks. 
 They put forward the reck -less slogan of a “revolutionary war” and bitterly attacked Leninand his supporters. 
 Their views gained some ground among Party131 132 organisations in Moscow, Petrograd, the Urals, etc. 
 The Moscow Regional Bureau of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
(B. 
), where the Left Communists temporarily had a majority, adopted a resolution on December 28, 1917 (January 10, 1918), demanding that the talks with Germany should be broken off. 
 Trotsky, who led the Soviet delegation at the second stage of the peace talks, adopted the provocative atti -tude which was summed up in his statement: “No peace, no war,army demobilised. 
” Trotsky and the Left Communists were impos -ing a policy on the Party which led to the destruction of theSoviet state. 
 On January 8 (21), 1918, Lenin gave an elaborate substantia -tion of the need for a peace in his “Theses on the Question of theImmediate Conclusion of a Separate and Annexationist Peace” (see pp. 
 442 -50 and Note 161). 
 But the Central Committee was not unanimous on the question of peace. 
 Lenin only succeeded in obtaining a decision to prolong the talks. 
 When the Soviet delega -tion was leaving for Brest -Litovsk, Lenin instructed Trotsky to drag out the talks to the utmost, but to sign a peace treaty in the event of a German ultimatum. 
 The talks were resumed on January 17 (30). 
 On January 27 (February 9), the delegation of the Austro -German bloc concluded a secret treaty with the representatives of the bourgeois -national -ist Central Ukrainian Rada, which actually gave Germany leaveto plunder the Ukraine. 
 Having thus reinforced its position, the German delegation, at the sittings on January 27 and 28 (February 9 and 10), demanded that the talks be speeded up. 
 On January 28 (February 10), the Soviet delegation asked for instructions and Lenin reaffirmed his earlier instructions (see p. 
 517). 
 However, Trotsky treacherously disobeyed these instructions and issued a statement at Brest -Litovsk to the effect that Soviet Russia would not sign a peace treaty would discontinue the war, and would demobilise the army. 
 This led to a break -down of the talks. 
 On February 18, the Germans started an offensive along the whole front . 
 At the morning sittings of the Central Committee on Febru -ary 17 and 18, Lenin’s proposal that talks should be started withGermany right away received a minority of votes. 
 Lenin first secured a majority in favour of signing a peace treaty at the eve -ning sitting of the Central Committee urgently called on February18, following a sharp and protracted struggle against Trotsky and the Left Communists, when the German offensive had become a fact. 
 On the morning of February 19 a wireless message was sent to the German Government stating the Soviet Government’s readi -ness to sign a peace on the German terms set forth at Brest -Litovsk (see p. 
 525). 
 The German Command took its time, while its troops continued to advance along the whole front, and within a week occupied a number of cities and came within striking distance of Petrograd. 
 The German Command’s reply, received on February 23, con -tained even more onerous terms. 
 The intense struggle continued in the Central Committee when the matter of the new German ultimatum was discussed on February 23. 
 It finally gave Lenin a majority for an immediate peace treaty on Germany’s terms. 
 That night, the All -Russia Central Executive Committee and the Council of People’s Commissars decided to accept the German peace terms, and this was communicated to the German Govern -ment. 
 The Left Communists continued their fight against the peace treaty, but the position of Lenin and his supporters was gaining ground among the Party masses. 
 Most of the local government organisations polled by the Council of People’s Commissars and the All -Russia Central Executive Committee also favoured signing the peace treaty. 
 It was signed on March 3. 
 The Seventh Party Congress, which was urgently called, gave a majority for the Leninist policy on peace. 
 The Extraordinary Fourth Congress of Soviets, held from March 14 to March 16, ratified the Treaty of Brest -Litovsk. 
 The November revolution in Germany (1918) overthrew Kaiser Wilhelm II, and this allowed the Soviet Government to abrogate the Treaty.

 349The decree was adopted by the Council of People’s Commissars on November 28 (December 11), 1917, following a counter -revolu -tionary demonstration staged that day by the Cadets in Petrograd. 
They had intended to mount a counter -revolutionary revolt by opening the Constituent Assembly despite the decree of the Council of People’s Commissars of November 26 (December 9), 1917, stating that it would be opened by a person specially authorised to do so by the government and in the presence of at least half its members.

 The decree was issued in view of the fact that several Right -wing newspapers had carried the decision133 134 135 136 of a group of former ministers who continued to style themselves as members of the Provisional Government, on the opening of the Constituent Assembly at the Taurida Palace at 2.

 354 The Second All -Russia Congress of Soviets of Peasants’ Deputies was held in Petrograd from November 26 to December 10 (Decem -ber 9 to 23), 1917. 
 Apart from delegates from various localitiesinvited by the Right Socialist -Revolutionary Peasant Executive Committee, it was attended by all the delegates of the Extraordi -nary Peasant Congress, a total of 790 with vote, including 305Socialist -Revolutionaries of the Centre and Right, 350 Left Socia -list-Revolutionaries, and 91 Bolsheviks. 
 The atmosphere at the Congress was extremely tense. 
 The Right Socialist -Revolutionaries tried to push the Congress their way, and to drive a wedge between the Bolsheviks and the Left Socialist -Revolutionaries, who were sitting on the fence. 
 There was an especially stiff fight over the attitude to the Constituent Assembly and the government’s decree declaring the Cadets enemies of the people. 
 Lenin spoke on these issues on December 2 (15). 
 At first a con -siderable majority supported the Right Socialist -Revolutionaries, whose resolution demanded the transfer of power to the Constit -uent Assembly and censure of the government’s acts in orderingthe arrest of several Cadets. 
 The Bolshevik group insisted on a re -vote, and the Congress passed the resolution of the Left Socialist -Revolutionaries. 
 Contradictions on the issue split the Congress and the Right -wingers walked out. 
 The Left -wing majority remained and continued their work. 
 They confirmed the decisions of the Extraordinary All -Russia Peasants’ Congress and adhered to the decisions of the Second All -Russia Congress of Soviets. 
 The Congress elected a new Executive Committee of Soviets of Peasants’ Dep -uties, which it authorised to join the All -Russia Central Execu -tive Committee in implementing the basic demands of the peasants for land and peace.

 357 Ukrainian Central Rada —a counter -revolutionary bourgeois -na-tionalist organisation set up at the All -Ukraine National Congress in Kiev in April 1917 by a bloc of Ukrainian bourgeois and petty -bourgeois nationalist parties and groups. 
 The ideologist of theUkrainian bourgeoisie, M. 
 S. 
 Grushevksy, was its chairman, and V. 
 K. 
 Vinnichenko, his deputy. 
 The Rada had a social base of urban and rural bourgeoisie, and petty -bourgeois nationalist -minded intellectuals. 
 It tried to build up the power of the Ukrain -ian bourgeoisie and landowners and set up a Ukrainian bourgeois state with the aid of the national liberation movement in the Ukraine. 
 It waved the banner of national independence in an effort to lead the Ukrainian masses away from the all -Russia revolutionary movement, subordinate them to the Ukrainian bourgeoisie and prevent the socialist revolution from winning out in the Ukraine. 
 It supported the Provisional Government in spite of contradictions over the issue of Ukrainian autonomy. 
137 138 After the Great October Socialist Revolution, the Rada pro -claimed itself the supreme organ of the Ukrainian People’s Repub -lic and launched an open struggle against Soviet power. 
 It was one of the centres of the counter -revolution. 
 The First All -Ukraine Congress of Soviets, held in Kharkov in December 1917, proclaimed the Ukraine a Soviet republic. 
 The Congress declared the Central Rada overthrown. 
 The Council of People’s Commissars of the R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
 recognised the Ukrain -ian Soviet Government as the sole legitimate government of theUkraine and decided to give it immediate help in fighting the counter -revolutionary Rada. 
 Armed uprisings against the Central Rada for the re -establishment of Soviet power took place all over the country in December 1917 and January 1918. 
 In January 1918, Soviet troops in the Ukraine launched an offensive and on January 26 (February 8) occupied Kiev. 
 The bourgeois Rada was overthrown. 
 Defeated and ousted from the territory of the Soviet Ukraine, deprived of any support among the working people, the Central Rada joined the German imperialists in an alliance to overthrow Soviet power and restore the rule of the bourgeoisie in the Ukraine. 
 It sent a delegation to Brest -Litovsk and secretly concluded a sepa -rate peace giving Germany the Ukraine’s corn, coal, raw mate -rials in return for military aid in the fight against Soviet power. 
 In March 1918, the Rada returned to Kiev as the puppet of the Austro -German invaders who dispersed it in late April when they realised that it was absolutely incapable of suppressing the revo -lutionary movement in the Ukraine and delivering the goods.

 After the members of the presidium of the Congress had seen the Manifesto it was read out on their behalf at the evening sitting of December 8 (21). 
 At the insistence of the Left Socialist -Revolutionaries the wording was toned down and in that form adopted by the Congress. 
 On behalf of the Executive Committee of the All -Russia Soviet of Peasants’ Deputies the Manifesto was published in the newspaper Golos Trudovogo Krestyanstva (Voice of the Labouring Peasantry) No.

 Dzerzhinsky was asked to form a commission to inquire into ways of fighting the sabotage. 
 On December 7 (20),139 140 141 142 the government heard his report, in connection with which Lenin appears to have written his draft decree.

 It was called on the initiative of the railwaymen’strade unions of the Moscow and Petrograd junctures, and was attended by nearly 300 delegates, of whom more than half were Bolsheviks. 
 On the second day of the Congress Lenin delivered a speech of greetings and was elected honorary chairman. 
 The Congress heard reports on the current situation, a speech by a repre -sentative of the Vikzhel, and reports on the food situation, trade -union organisation and the establishment of a network of local Soviets of Railwaymen’s Deputies. 
 The overwhelming majority of the Congress supported the views of the Second All -Russia Congress of Soviets. 
 The Congress adopted a resolution stating that the Vikzhel’s policy was playing into the hands of the counter -revolutionary bourgeoisie, and passed a vote of no confidencein it. 
 The Congress elected 78 delegates for the Railwaymen’s Congress set by the Vikzhel for December 19, 1917 (January 1, 1918).

 386 Delivered to the All -Russia Central Executive Committee on December 14 (27), 1917, in connection with a discussion of the decree nationalising the banks. 
 Work on practical measures for the nationalisation of the banks was started as soon as the socialist revolution won out. 
 The State Bank was seized on October 25 (November 7), 1917. 
 Having overcome the sabotage of the bourgeois officials, Soviet power soon established practical control of the State Bank and set up control over private banks as a transitional measure to their nationalisation. 
 However, because of sabotage by the bank -ers, the Soviet Government speeded up the nationalisation ofprivate banks. 
 On the morning of December 14 (27), the Govern -ment ordered workers’ detachments and Red Guard units to seizeall banks and credit institutions in Petrograd. 
 That same day, the All -Russia Central Executive Committee adopted decrees “On the Nationalisation of the Banks” and “On the Inspection of Steel Safes in Banks”. 
 Both decrees were published in Izvestia No.

 391 The questions were raised by Lenin on December 17 (30), 1917 -at a conference of delegates to the Army Congress on the Demo -bilisation of the Army whom the Congress had elected to partici -pate in a Commission for the Demobilisation of the Army under the People’s Commissariat for the Army. 
 No answers or sum -maries of answers have been discovered in the archives. 
 It wouldappear that the answers helped Lenin to arrive at the firm con -viction that it would be impossible to continue the war with theGermans, and were taken into account in working out the Party’s tactics at the peace talks with Germany. 
 The results of the ques -tionnaire were discussed by the government on December 18 (31)after a report given by N. 
 V. 
 Krylenko on the situation at the front and the morale of the army. 
 The government resolved to146 147 148 recognise the results of the questionnaire as being exhaustive and adopted a resolution drafted by Lenin (see p. 
 397). 
 The manuscript of Lenin’s questionnaire has not come down to us; the text published here was given in a letter from a man who was present at the conference, D. 
 S. 
 Vitebsky, to the Lenin Institute in 1924. 
 The Army Congress on the Demobilisation of the Army was held in Petrograd from December 15 (28), 1917, to January 3 (16), 1918. 
 It was attended by delegates from the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies, front -line and corps committees, engi -neers, artillery units and brigades, staffs, etc. 
 When the Congressopened there were 234 delegates, 119 of them Bolsheviks and 45 Left Socialist -Revolutionaries. 
 The Mensheviks and the Right Socialist -Revolutionaries appeared to have formed the so -called “extra -factional group”. 
 The number of delegates subsequently increased to 272. 
 The task of the Congress was to control the spon -taneous demobilisation of the army and to discuss the creationof a new army of the socialist state. 
 The Congress was for all pur -poses a caretaker organ to guide the army demobilisation anddid a great deal of work to that effect. 
 On December 28, 1917 (January 10, 1918), the Congress dis -cussed the organisation of a socialist army, and the Bolshevikgroup motioned a project for the formation of a workers’ and peas -ants’ army. 
 It was opposed by the Mensheviks and Right Social -ist-Revolutionaries. 
 After some hesitation the Left -wingers sup -ported the Bolsheviks. 
 The project was adopted by 153 to 40with 13 abstentions. 
 Lenin was expected to speak at the Congress but was unable to do so because of pressure of work. 
 On January 3 (16), the closing day, he sent a message of greetings to the delegates (see p.

 Lenin made a short speech at the meeting of the Bolshevik group (no record of it remains). 
 He proposed that his declaration of the Bolshevik group should be read out in the Assem -bly, after which the Bolsheviks would walk out. 
 His proposal wasadopted by the group. 
 When the Bolsheviks left, the Left Socialist -Revolutionaries, whose attitude to the Constituent Assembly was uncertain, motion -ed an immediate vote on the attitude to the policy of peaceconducted by Soviet power. 
 When this proposal was rejected by the Right wing, the Left Socialist -Revolutionaries walked out as well. 
 Shortly after, P. 
 E. 
 Dybenko, People’s Commissar for the Navy; who was in charge of security in the Taurida Palace, ordered the guard to close the sitting of the Constituent Assembly.

 At 7. 
30 p. 
m. 
 on Febru -ary 16, 1918, the German Command officially informed the Sovietrepresentatives at Brest -Litovsk that the ceasefire between Russia and Germany would be terminated at noon on February 18 and a state of war resumed. 
 Under the Brest -Litovsk armistice agree -ment, concluded on December 2 (15), 1917, the parties were boundto give a seven -day notice of their intention to abrogate the agree -ment. 
 The German Command violated this commitment. 
 TheSoviet Government sent a protest to the German Government over the breach of the armistice agreement, but received no reply. 
 On the morning of February 18 reports were received that German troops had gone into action. 
 At the Central Committee meeting, Lenin’s proposal that a telegram should be sent to the German Government immedi -ately was opposed by Trotsky and Bukharin; Zinoviev favouredits dispatch.

 However, when the question was formulated as follows: “If the German offensive becomes a fact, without there being any revolutionary upsurge in Germany and Austria, do we conclude a peace?” Trotsky voted in the affirmative. 
 Bukharin,180 181 182 Lomov, Uritsky and Krestinsky abstained, and only Ioffe voted against. 
 Thus the proposal was adopted by a majority. 
 p. 
 520 The evening sitting of the Central Committee on February 18, 1918, was held in a highly tense atmosphere. 
 It was called in view of the fact that the Germans had launched an offensive that day and had taken Dvinsk in their headlong advance. 
 The Left Com -munists once again opposed Lenin’s proposals, but Trotsky pro -posed that inquiries should be sent to Berlin and Vienna about the German Government’s demands, without informing it of the consent to conclude a peace. 
 Sverdlov, Stalin and Zinoviev favour -ed the dispatch of a telegram to the German Government inform -ing it of readiness to resume the talks. 
 It was at this sitting that Lenin first succeeded, after a bitter struggle, to secure a majority in favour of concluding a peace: his proposal for an immediate message to the German Government offering to conclude peace was adopted by 7 votes to 6. 
 p. 
 522 The wireless message to the Government of the German Reich was sent to Berlin on the morning of February 19 on behalf of the Council of People’s Commissars. 
 But the German Government’s reply, containing even harsher peace terms, was handed to the Soviet courier only on February 22 and was received in Petro -grad on the morning of February 23; it demanded that the newpeace terms should be studied within 48 hours. 
 The Germans, while delaying their own reply, continued their offensive, and in those few days covered a great deal of territory; they occupied a number of towns and came within striking distance of Petro -grad.
