 Most of the book consists of articles pub-lished in the underground Bolshevik newspapers Vperyod and Proletary . 
 The articles “The Autocracy and the Proletariat”, “The Fall of Port Arthur”, “European Capital and the Autocracy”,and “Debacle” give an analysis of the military defeat and po-litical crisis of the autocracy and predict the inevitabilityof the revolution in Russia. 
 The articles “Two Tactics”, “Should We Organise the Revolution?”, “New Tasks and New Forces”, “On the Provi-sional Revolutionary Government”, “The Revolutionary-Democratic Dictatorship of the Proletariat and the Peasant-ry”, and “The Revolutionary Army and the RevolutionaryGovernment” examine and develop the revolutionary tactics of the Bolshevik Party and expose and criticise the opportun-ist tactics of the Mensheviks.

 In his article “Revolution in Russia”, Lenin for the first time evaluates the events of January 9 as the beginning of the revolution and salutes the insurgent proletariat. 
 Hisarticles “The First Steps”, “The Eve of Bloody Sunday”, “TheNumber of Killed or Wounded”, “The Battles on the Bar-ricades”, and “St. 
 Petersburg After January 9” deal with theearly days of the revolutionary struggle in St. 
 Petersburg and with the growing political consciousness of the Russian proletariat. 
 In his “First of May” leaflet, Lenin sets forth the tasks of the proletariat and the peasantry in the revolution andcalls for the preparation of the popular armed uprising. 
 The item “Conferences of the Committees” reports on the conferences of the local committees which went on record for the immediate convocation of the Third Party Congress. 
The article “From the New-Iskra Camp” exposes the system-atic deception of the Party by the Mensheviks. 
 The documents “Resolution on the Armed Uprising”, “Speech on the Procedure of the Discussion of the Resolutions on the Relations Between Workers and Intellectuals Within the Social-Democratic Organisations”, “Resolution on thePublication of the Congress Proceedings”, and “Draft Reso-lution on the Events in the Caucasus” pertain to the materi-als of the Third Congress of the R.

 In the short article “The New Russian Loan” Lenin deals with the decline of the tsarist government's credit abroad due to the military defeats and the growing discontent with-in the country. 
 THE AUTOCRACY AND THE PROLETARIAT 1 Published in Vperyod , No. 
 1, Published according to January 4, 1905 the text in the (December 22, 1904 ) newspaper Vperyod Front page of the Bolshevik newspaper Vperyod , No. 
 1, January 4, 1905 (December 22, 1904), with Lenin’s article “The Autocracy and the Proletariat” Reduced Russia is experiencing a resurgence of the constitutional movement. 
 Our generation has never witnessed anythinglike the present political ferment. 
 Legal newspapers areattacking the bureaucracy, demanding participation of thepeople’s representatives in the state administration, andpressing for liberal reforms. 
 All varieties of meetings of Zem-stvo officials, 2 doctors, lawyers, engineers, farmers, munici-pal councillors,3 etc. 
, etc. 
, are adopting resolutions more or less definitely demanding a constitution. 
 Passionate appealsfor liberty and political accusations of a boldness to whichthe Russian man in the street is unaccustomed can be heard atevery turn. 
 Under pressure of the workers and the radical youth, liberal gatherings are converted into open public meet-ings and street demonstrations. 
 Undercurrents of discontentare manifestly stirring among wide sections of the proletariat,among the poor of town and country. 
 Although the prole-tariat is taking a comparatively small part in the more spec-tacular and ceremonious manifestations of the liberal move-ment, although it seems to be standing somewhat aloof from the polite conferences of the solid citizens, everything pointsto the fact that the workers are keenly interested in themovement. 
 Everything points to the fact that the workers areeager for big public meetings and open street demonstrations. 
The proletariat is holding itself back, as it were, carefully taking its bearings, gathering its forces, and deciding the question whether or not the moment for the decisive strugglefor freedom has come. 
 Apparently, the wave of liberal excitation is beginning to subside somewhat. 
 The rumours and foreign newspaperreports to the effect that reactionaries have gained the upper hand in the most influential Court circles are being confirmed. 
 The ukase of Nicholas II, published the other day, wasa direct slap in the face for the liberals. 
 4 The tsar intends to preserve and uphold the autocratic regime. 
 The tsar does not want to change the form of government and has no intention of granting a constitution. 
 He promises—only promises—all manner of reforms of a quite paltry nature. 
 No guarantees, ofcourse, are given that these reforms will really be implement-ed. 
 Police restrictions against the liberal press are becomingdaily and hourly more stringent. 
 All open demonstrationsare being suppressed again, if anything, with greater severi-ty than before. 
 The screw is being put on the liberal council-lors again, both Zemstvo 5 and municipal, still more so in the case of those officials who play the liberal. 
 The liberalnewspapers are falling into a despondent tone and apologis-ing to their correspondents for not publishing their letters,which they dare not do. 
 It is quite within the realm of possibility that the wave of liberal agitation which rose so rapidly after the permissiongranted by Svyatopolk-Mirsky 6 will abate just as quickly af-ter the new ban. 
 One must distinguish between the profoundcauses, which inevitably and unavoidably lead—and willlead more and more—to opposition and struggle against the autocracy, and the trivial reasons of a passing liberal fer-ment. 
 The profound causes lead to profound, powerful, andpersistent popular movements. 
 Trivial reasons are at timesCabinet changes or the usual attempt on the part of thegovernment to pursue for an hour the policy of “the sly fox”after some terrorist act. 
 The assassination of Plehve 7 evidently cost the terrorist organisation tremendous effort and in-volved long preparation. 
 The very success of this terrorist actbears out all the more strikingly the experience of the entirehistory of the Russian revolutionary movement, which warnsus against such methods of struggle as terrorism. 
 Russianterrorism has always been a specifically intellectualist method of struggle. 
 And whatever may be said of the importance of terrorism, not in lieu of, but in conjunction with, thepeople’s movement, the facts irrefutably testify that in ourcountry individual political assassinations have nothing incommon with the forcible actions of the people’s revolution. 
In capitalist society a mass movement is possible only as a class movement of the workers. 
 This movement is developing in Russia according to its own independent laws; it is pro-ceeding in its own way, gaining in depth and io breadth, and passing from a temporary lull to a new upsurge. 
 It is only the liberal wave that rises and falls strictly in accord with the moods of the different ministers, whose replacement is accel-erated by bombs. 
 Small wonder, then, that sympathy withterrorism is to be met with so often in our country among theradical (or radical-posing) representatives of the bourgeoisopposition. 
 Small wonder that, among the revolutionaryintelligentsia, the people most likely to be carried away (whether for long or for a moment) by terrorism are those who have no faith in the vitality and strength of the proletariatand the proletarian class struggle. 
 The fact that the spurt of liberal activity for one or anoth-er reason is short-lived and unstable cannot, of course, makeus forget the irremovable contradiction that exists between the autocracy and the needs of the developing bourgeois society. 
 The autocracy is bound to be a drag on social develop-ment. 
 The interests of the bourgeoisie as a class, as well asthe interests of the intelligentsia, without which moderncapitalist production is inconceivable, clash more and morewith the autocracy as time goes on. 
 Superficial though the reason for the liberals’ declarations may be and petty though the character of the liberals’ half-hearted and equivocalposition, the autocracy can maintain real peace only with ahandful of highly privileged magnates from the landowningand merchant class, but in no sense with that class as a whole. 
Direct representation of the interests of the ruling class in the form of a constitution is essential for a country that wants to be a European country and, on pain of political and economicdefeat, is obliged by its position to become a European coun-try. 
 It is therefore extremely important for the class-consciousproletariat to have a clear understanding both of the inevita-bility of the liberals’ protests against the autocracy and of the actual bourgeois character of these protests. 
 The working class is setting itself the great and epoch-making aims of liberating humanity from every form ofoppression and exploitation of man by man. 
 Throughout theworld it has striven hard for decades on end to achieve theseaims, steadily widening its struggle and organising itself in mass parties, undaunted by occasional defeats and temporary setbacks. 
 Nothing can be more vital for such a truly revolu-tionary class than to rid itself of all self-deception, of all mirages and illusions. 
 One of the most widespread and persist-ent illusions with us in Russia is the notion that our liberal movement is not a bourgeois movement, and that the impend-ing revolution in Russia will not be a bourgeois revolution. 
The Russian intellectual, from the most moderate Osvobozh-deniye liberal 8 to the most extreme Socialist-Revolutionary,9 always thinks that one makes our revolution colourless, that one degrades and vulgarises it, by admitting it to be a bour-geois revolution. 
 To the Russian class-conscious proletarian this admission is the only true class characterisation of theactual state of affairs. 
 To the proletarian the struggle for po-litical liberty and a democratic republic in a bourgeoissociety is only one of the necessary stages in the struggle for thesocial revolution which will overthrow the bourgeois system. 
 Strictly differentiating between stages that are essentially different, soberly examining the conditions under which theymanifest themselves, does not at all mean indefinitely post-poning one’s ultimate aim, or slowing down one’s progress inadvance. 
 On the contrary, it is for the purpose of accelerat-ing the advance and of achieving the ultimate aim as quickly and securely as possible that it is necessary to understand the relation of classes in modern society. 
 Nothing but disillusion-ment and unending vacillation await those who shun theallegedly one-sided class point of view, who would be social-ists, yet are afraid openly to call the impending revolutionin Russia—the revolution that has begun in Russia—a bourgeois revolution. 
 Characteristically, at the very height of the present constitutional movement, the more democratic of the legalpublications took advantage of the unusual freedom toattack, not only the “bureaucracy”, but also the “exclusive andhence erroneous theory of the class struggle” which is alleged to be “scientifically untenable” ( Nasha Zhizn , 10 No. 
 28). 
 If you please, the problem of bringing the intelligentsia closerto the masses “has hitherto been dealt with solely by throwingthe emphasis on the class contradictions existing betweenthe masses and those sections of society from which ... thegreater part of the intelligentsia springs”. 
 Needless to say, this presentation of the facts is completely at variance with the real state of affairs. 
 The very opposite is true. 
 The entiremass of the Russian legally-active uplift intelligentsia, all the old Russian socialists, all political figures of the Osvo-bozhdeniye type have always completely ignored the profound nature of the class contradictions in Russia in general and in the Russian countryside in particular. 
 Even the extremeLeft Russian radical intelligentsia , the Socialist-Revolution-ary Party, sins most in ignoring this fact; one need onlyrecall its usual arguments about the “labouring peasantry”,or about the impending revolution being “not a bourgeois, but a democratic one ”. 
 No, the nearer the moment of revolution draws and the more acute the constitutional movement becomes, the morestrictly must the party of the proletariat guard its classindependence and not allow its class demands to be swampedin general democratic phrases. 
 The more frequently and decidedly the representatives of so-called society come forward with what they claim to be the demands of the wholepeople, the more relentlessly must the Social-Democratsexpose the class nature of this “society”. 
 Take the notoriousresolution of the “secret” Zemstvo congress held on Novem-ber 6-8. 
 11 You will find there, thrust into the background, deliberately hazy and half-hearted constitutional aspirations. 
 You will find mention there of the people and society, moreoften society than the people. 
 You will find the most detailedand comprehensive suggestions for reforms of the Zemstvoand municipal institutions—institutions, that is, whichrepresent the interests of the landowners and the capitalists. 
 You will find mention of reforms in the living conditions of the peasantry, of the liberation of the peasantry from tute-lage, and of the safeguarding of correct judicial forms. 
 It isquite clear that you are dealing with representatives of thepropertied classes who are only bent on securing concessionsfrom the autocracy and have no thought of changing in any way the foundations of the economic system. 
 If people like these want a “radical [allegedly radical] * change in the present state of inequality and oppression of the peasantry”,it only proves anew that the Social-Democrats were right intirelessly stressing the backwardness of the system and of the *Interpolations in square brackets (within passages quoted by Lenin) have been introduced by Lenin, unless otherwise indicated. 
— Ed. 
 living conditions of the peasantry in relation to the general conditions of the bourgeois order. 
 The Social-Democrats have always urged that the class-conscious proletariat should strictly distinguish in the general peasant movement theover-riding interests and demands of the peasant bourgeoisie,however much these demands may be veiled and nebulous,and in whatever cloak of utopian “levelling” the peasantideology (and “Socialist-Revolutionary” phrase-mongering) may invest them. 
 Take the resolutions of the engineers’ ban-quet in St. 
 Petersburg on December 5. 
 You will find that the590 banquet guests, and together with them the 6,000engineers who subscribed to the resolution, declared for aconstitution, “without which Russian industry cannot be pro-perly protected”, while at the same time protesting against the placing of government orders with foreign concerns. 
 Can anyone still fail to see that it is the interests of all sections of the landowning, commercial, industrial and peasantbourgeoisie which are at the bottom of the constitutionalaspirations that have erupted to the surface? Are we to beled astray by the fact that these interests are represented by the democratic intelligentsia, which everywhere and always, in all European revolutions of the bourgeoisie, has assumedthe role of publicists, speakers, and political leaders? A grave task now confronts the Russian proletariat. 
 The autocracy is wavering. 
 The burdensome and hopeless war intowhich it has plunged has seriously undermined the founda-tions of its power and rule. 
 It cannot maintain itself in power now without an appeal to the ruling classes, without the sup-port of the intelligentsia; such an appeal and such support,however, are bound to lead to constitutional demands. 
 Thebourgeois classes are trying to force an advantage for them-selves out of the government’s predicament. 
 The government is playing a desperate game; it is trying to wriggle out of its difficulties, to get off with a few paltry concessions, non-polit-ical reforms, and non-committal promises, with which thetsar’s new ukase is replete. 
 Whether this game will succeed,even temporarily and partially, will in the long run dependon the Russian proletariat, on the degree of its organisation and the force of its revolutionary onset. 
 The proletariat must take advantage of the political situation, which is greatly inits favour. 
 The proletariat must support the constitutional movement of the bourgeoisie; it must rouse and rally to its side the broadest possible sections of the exploited masses, muster all its forces, and start an uprising at the moment when the government is in the most desperate straits andpopular unrest is at its highest. 
 What immediate form should the proletariat’s support of the constitutionalists take? Chiefly, the utilisation of thegeneral unrest for the purpose of carrying on agitation and organising the least involved and most backward sections of the working class and the peasantry. 
 Naturally, the organisedproletariat, Social-Democracy, should send its forces amongall classes of the population; yet the more independentlythe classes now act, the more acute the struggle becomes, andthe nearer the moment of the decisive battle approaches, the more should our work be concentrated on preparing the pro-letarians and semi-proletarians themselves for the directstruggle for freedom. 
 At such a moment only opportunistscan qualify the speeches of individual workingmen in Zemstvoand other public assemblies as a very active struggle, or anew method of struggle, or the highest type of demonstration. 
 Such manifestations can only be of quite secondary impor-tance. 
 It is far more important now to turn the attention ofthe proletariat to really high and active forms of struggle,such as the famous mass demonstration in Rostov and anumber of mass demonstrations in the South. 
 12 It is far more important now to increase our ranks, organise our forces, and prepare for an even more direct and open mass conflict. 
 Of course, there is no suggestion in this that the ordinary day-to-day work of the Social-Democrats should be aban-doned. 
 Social-Democrats will never give up that work, whichthey regard as the real preparation for the decisive fight;for they rely wholly and exclusively on the activity, the class-consciousness, and the organisation of the proletariat, on its influence among the labouring and exploited masses. 
It is a question of pointing out the right road, of calling atten-tion to the need for going forward, to the harmfulness oftactical vacillations. 
 The day-to-day work, which the class-conscious proletariat should never forget under any circum-stances, includes also the work of organisation. 
 Without broad and diverse workers’ organisations, and without theirconnection with revolutionary Social-Democracy, it is impossible to wage a successful struggle against the autocracy. 
 On the other hand, organisational work is impossible without a firm rebuff to the disorganising tendencies displayed in our country, as everywhere else, by the weak-willed intellectualelements in the Party, who change their slogans like gloves;organisational work is impossible without a struggle againstthe absurd and reactionary organisation-as-process “theory”,which serves to conceal confusion of every description. 
 The development of the political crisis in Russia will now depend chiefly on the course of the war with Japan. 
This war has done more than anything else to expose the rot-tenness of the autocracy; it is doing more than anything elseto drain its strength financially and militarily, and totorment and spur on to revolt the long-suffering masses of the people, of whom this criminal and shameful war is demand-ing such endless sacrifices. 
 Autocratic Russia has alreadybeen defeated by constitutional Japan, and dragging on thewar will only increase and aggravate the defeat. 
 The bestpart of the Russian navy has been destroyed; the position ofPort Arthur is hopeless, and the naval squadron sent to its relief has not the slightest chance of even reaching its desti-nation, let alone of achieving success; the main army underKuropatkin has lost over 200,000 men and stands exhaustedand helpless before the enemy, who is bound to crush it afterthe capture of Port Arthur. 
 Military disaster is inevitable,and together with it discontent, unrest, and indignation will inevitably increase tenfold. 
 We must prepare for that moment with the utmost energy. 
 At that moment, one of the outbreaks which are recurring,now here, now there, with such growing frequency, will developinto a tremendous popular movement. 
 At that momentthe proletariat will rise and take its stand at the head of the insurrection to win freedom for the entire people and to secure for the working class the possibility of waging theopen and broad struggle for socialism, a struggle enriched bythe whole experience of Europe. 
 GOOD DEMONSTRATIONS OF PROLETARIANS AND POOR ARGUMENTS OF CERTAIN INTELLECTUALS The present-day constitutional movement among the prop-ertied classes in our country differs sharply from former move-ments of the same type at the end of the fifties and seventies. 
 The constitutional demands of the liberals are essential-ly the same. 
 The speeches of the radical orators reiterate thefamiliar propositions of Zemstvo liberalism. 
 The proletariat’sparticipation in the movement provides a significant and veryimportant new factor. 
 The Russian working class, whose movement was the pivot of the entire revolutionary move-ment of the past decade, has long since reached the stage ofopen struggle, of street demonstrations, of popular massmeetings in defiance of the police, and of head-on clasheswith the enemy in the streets of the southern cities. 
 And the liberal-bourgeois movement is at this moment marked by the bold, determined, incomparably sharper and more daring entry of the proletariat upon the scene. 
 We wouldmention, first, the demonstration in St. 
 Petersburg, in whichthe workers’ participation was unfortunately weak, owing tothe disorganising activity of the “Mensheviks”, and thedemonstration in Moscow. 
 Next we would mention the pres-ence of workers at a liberal-bourgeois banquet in Smolensk; at a meeting of the Educational Society in Nizhni-Novgorod;and at conferences of scientific, medical, and other societiesin various cities. 
 Further, there were the large meeting ofworkers in Saratov, the demonstration of November 6 in theKharkov Law Society, that of November 20 in the Ekateri-nodar Municipal Council, that of November 18 in the Odessa Health Protection Society, and, again in Odessa, somewhatlater, in the Regional Law Court. 
 We would add that both demonstrations in Odessa and the one in Kharkov were accompanied by street demonstrations of workers, by processions with banners through the streets, by the singing of revolutionary songs, and so forth. 
 The last four demonstrations are described, incidentally, in Iskra , No. 
 79,13 under the heading “Proletarian Demon-strations”, to which descriptions I should like to draw thereader’s attention. 
 First, I shall indicate the facts according to Iskra , following which I shall give Iskra ’s comments. 
 Kharkov. 
 The Committee organises the participation of workers in a meeting of the Law Society. 
 Over two hundredworkers are present; some of the workers felt embarrassedabout attending such an august assembly, while otherscould not enter because “muzhiks were not admitted”. 
 The liberal chairman takes to his heels after the first revolu-tionary speech. 
 Then follows the speech of a Social-Democrat,leaflets are tossed into the air, the Marseillaise is sung, and the participants pour out into the street, and together with acrowd of close on 500 workers march along with a red flag,singing labour songs. 
 Towards the end some are beaten up and arrested. 
 Ekaterinodar. 
 A large crowd flocks to the hall of the munici-pal council (attracted by rumours of liberals’ speeches to bedelivered there). 
 The telephone is cut off. 
 A speaker from thecommittee makes his way into the hall with 30 or 40 workersand delivers a short, fully revolutionary Social-Democratic speech. 
 Applause. 
 Leaflets. 
 Consternation among the coun-cillors. 
 The Mayor protests unavailingly. 
 At the conclusion,the demonstrators leave the hall calmly. 
 That night—numerous house searches by the police. 
 Odessa. 
 First demonstration. 
 A meeting attended by about two thousand people, the mass of them workers. 
 A number of revolutionary speeches (Social-Democratic and Socialist-Revolutionary), thunderous applause, revolutionary out-cries, leaflets. 
 Marching through the streets with revolu-tionary songs. 
 Dispersing without a clash. 
 Odessa. 
 Second demonstration. 
 A gathering of several thousand. 
 A similarly vast revolutionary public rally and march through the streets as in the previous demon-stration. 
 A clash. 
 Many hurt, some seriously. 
 One womanworker dies. 
 Sixty arrests. 
 Such are the facts of the case. 
 Such are the demonstrations of the Russian proletarians. 
 Now, as to the line of reasoning of certain Social-Democratic intellectuals. 
 It relates to the demonstration in Ekateri-nodar, to which an entire article has been devoted. 
 Readattentively: “In this demonstration for the first time theorganised Russian proletariat came face to face with our liberal-minded bourgeoisie!”... The demonstration “is a further step in the development of forms of political struggle”; it is, “when all is said and done, a really new method of politicalstruggle which yields very evident fruitful results”; theworkers in such demonstrations “feel that they are acting asdefinite political units”, they acquire “a sense of competence toact as the political fighters of the party”. 
 We see spreading “in the broadest social circles the idea of the party as of some-thing quite definite, something that has taken shape, and,what is most important, something that has the right to put forth demands ”. 
 People are beginning to look upon the whole party “as an active, fighting political force whichstates its demands clearly and definitely”. 
 It is necessary “to make wider use of the new method of struggle—in the councils, in the Zemstvos and at every kind of assembly ofpublic figures”. 
 And the editors of Iskra , in unison with the author of these views, speak of “the idea of demonstrationsof a new type”, of the fact that “in Ekaterinodar in particularour comrades were able to show ‘society’ that they were acting as an independent party which feels capable of influenc-ing the course of events and endeavours to do so”. 
 Well, well. 
 “In Ekaterinodar in particular. 
”... A new step, a new method, a new practice, face to face for the first time,very evident fruitful results, definite political units, a senseof political competence, the right to put forth demands.... 
 To me these pompous attempts at profound reasoning smacked of something stale, passé , and almost forgotten. 
 But be-fore accounting to myself how I sensed the staleness, I invol-untarily asked: Pardon me, gentlemen, but why “inEkaterinodar in particular”? Why indeed is it a new method?Why is it that the Kharkov and Odessa comrades do not brag (excuse the vulgar expression) about the newness of the method and the evident fruitful results, about meeting face toface for the first time, and a sense of political competence? Why are the results of a meeting of a few dozen workers together with several hundred liberals within the four walls of a council hall more evident and fruitful than the meetings of thousands of workers, not only in medical and law societies,but in the streets ? Can it really be that street meetings (in Odessa, as well as those previously held in Rostov-on-Donand other cities) are less likely to develop a sense of politicalcompetence and the right to put forth demands than meetings in municipal councils?... True, I must admit that I feel rather uncomfortable in quoting this last expression (the right to put forth demands ); it is so stupid. 
 But you can’t throw the words out of a song. 
 In one instance, however, this expression acquires some meaning, and not only this expression, but Iskra ’s entire line of reasoning, namely, if we presume the existence of parlia-mentarism, if we visualise for a moment that the Ekaterino-dar Municipal Council has been transplanted to the banks ofthe Thames, next to Westminster Abbey. 
 On this slightassumption it becomes clear why, within the four walls of adelegates’ meeting hall one can have more “right to put forth demands” than in the streets; why struggle against a Prime Minister, that is, the Mayor of Ekaterinodar, is more fruitfulthan struggle against a policeman; why the sense of politicalcompetence and the knowledge of oneself as a definite politi-cal unit is heightened precisely in the hall of a parliamentor in the hall of a Zemstvo Assembly. 
 Indeed, why not play at parliamentarism for lack of a real parliament? One can obtain here such a vivid mental picture of “a meeting face toface”, of “a new method”, and all the rest of it. 
 True, thesemental pictures will inevitably divert our thoughts from theissues of a real mass struggle for parliamentarism, instead of playing at parliamentarism; that, however, is a trifle. 
 But then what evident, tangible results.... 
 Tangible results.... 
 The expression immediately reminds me of Comrade Martynov and Rabocheye Dyelo . 
 14 Without reverting to the latter it is impossible to appraise the newIskra correctly. 
 The arguments about “a new method of struggle” in connection with the Ekaterinodar demonstration are a repetition of the arguments used by the editors in their “Letter to Party Organisations” (incidentally, is it wise tokeep the original a secret, stacked away, and to circulate only a copy openly for general information?). 
 The editors’ arguments follow Rabocheye Dyelo ’s usual trend of thought, but in another connection. 
 Wherein lay the error and the harmfulness of the Rabocheye Dyelo “theory” of imparting a political character to the economic struggle itself, the “theory” of the economic struggleof the workers against the employers and the government, ofthe need to present to the government concrete demands which promise certain tangible results? Should we not impart a political character to the economic struggle? Wecertainly should. 
 But when Rabocheye Dyelo deduced the polit-ical aims of a revolutionary party of the proletariat from the“economic” (trade-unionist) struggle, it unjustifiablynarrowed and vulgarised the Social-Democratic conception, it detracted from the tasks of the proletariat’s all-round polit-ical struggle. 
 Wherein lie the error and the harmfulness of the new Iskra ’s theory of a new method, of a higher type of mobilisation of the proletarian forces, of a new way of developing the senseof political competence among the workers, their “right to put forth demands”, and so on, and so forth? Should we not organise workers’ demonstrations both in the Zemstvo As-semblies and on the occasion of these assemblies? We certain-ly should. 
 But in speaking of good proletarian demonstra-tions we should not talk highbrow nonsense. 
 We shall onlydemoralise the class-consciousness of the proletariat, we shall only divert the proletariat from the tasks, increasingly press-ing, of the real, serious, open struggle, if we extol as a newmethod those very features of our ordinary demonstrationswhich least resemble active struggle and which it would beludicrous to declare as productive of excellent results or asheightening the sense of political competence, etc. 
 Both our old acquaintance, Comrade Martynov, and the new Iskra are guilty of the sin peculiar to the intelligentsia— lack of faith in the strength of the proletariat; in its ability toorganise, in general, and to create a party organisation, inparticular; in its ability to conduct the political struggle. 
Rabocheye Dyelo believed that the proletariat was still inca-pable, and would be incapable for a long time to come, of conducting the political struggle that goes beyond the limitsof the economic struggle against the employers and the /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR government. 
 The new Iskra believes that the proletariat is still incapable, and will be incapable for a long time to come, of independent revolutionary action, and it calls a demonstration of a few dozen workers before the Zemstvopeople a new method of struggle. 
 Both the old Rabocheye Dyelo and the new Iskra religiously repeat the phrases about the independent activity and self-education of the proletariatonly because this religious fervour screens the intellectualist incomprehension of the real forces of the proletariat and of the urgent tasks that confront it. 
 Both the old Rabocheye Dyelo and the new Iskra talk absolute nonsense with an air of profundity about the special significance of tangible andevident results, and about a concrete contraposition of bour-geoisie and proletariat, thereby diverting the attention of the proletariat from the increasingly pressing task of a direct onset upon the autocracy, at the head of a popular uprising,towards playing at parliamentarism. 
 In undertaking to revise the old organisational and tactical principles of revolutionarySocial-Democracy and fussily searching for new formulas and“new methods”, both the old Rabocheye Dyelo and the new Iskra are in fact dragging the Party back, proposing super-seded, at times even downright reactionary, slogans. 
 We have had enough of this new revision that leads to the old rubbish! It is time to go forward and stop covering updisorganisation with the notorious organisation-as-processtheory; it is time, in workers’ demonstrations, to accentuate and advance to the foreground those features that tend to bring them closer to the real, open struggle for freedom. 
 Vperyod , No. 
 1, January 4, 1905 Published according to (December 22, 1904 ) the text in Vperyod TIME TO CALL A HALT! All eyewitnesses agree that the demonstration of November 28 was a failure because of the almost complete absence ofworkers. 
 But why did the workers keep away from the dem-onstration? Why did the St. 
 Petersburg Committee, inresponse to whose call the student youth had come to the dem-onstration, fail to take steps to secure the attendance of the workers, thus defeating its own enterprise? The answer to these questions is given in the following letter from a worker,a member of the Committee, from which we print the mostimportant passages: “Feeling (at the beginning of November) was running high and seek-ing an outlet. 
 This outlet was to be provided by a demonstration, andin fact a leaflet did appear at that time, issued in the name of the Stu-dents’ Social-Democratic Organisation and calling for a demonstra-tion on November 14. 
 On learning of this, the Committee proposed tothe organisation that the demonstration be postponed until the end ofNovember, to permit joint participation with the St. 
 Petersburg prole-tariat. 
 The students agreed.... 
 The class-conscious workers were veryeager to have a demonstration. 
 Many workers came to Nevsky Prospekt on November 14 under the impression that the students’ demonstra-tion would take place. 
 When they were told that they should not havecome without a call by the Committee, they conceded the point, butsaid that they ‘thought there would be something doing there anyway’. 
At any rate, this fact illustrates the mood of the class-conscious work-ers. 
 “At a meeting of the Committee on November 18 it was decided to hold the demonstration on the 28th. 
 A subcommittee was immediatelyset up to organise the demonstration and work out a plan of action;it was decided to issue two preparatory agitational leaflets and a call. 
We threw ourselves into the job with all energy. 
 The writer of theselines personally arranged several meetings of workers, study circle members, at which we discussed the role of the working class and the aim and significance of a demonstration at the present moment. 
 Wediscussed the question of an armed or an unarmed demonstration, andall these meetings adopted resolutions supporting the decision of theCommittee. 
 The workers demanded as many leaflets as possible fordistribution. 
 ‘Give us wagon-loads,’ they said. 
 “And so, a demonstration, which promised to be really impressive was being prepared for the 28th. 
 But here our St. 
 Petersburg ‘Minori-ty’, like the ‘all-Russian’ ‘Minority’ and the ‘Minority’ abroad, could not help playing a purely negative role, the role of a disorganiser. 
 Tomake that role perfectly clear, I shall have to say a few words about the local ‘Minority’ and its activities. 
 Before the demonstration, and after, the Committee consisted largely of adherents of the Majority ofthe Second Party Congress. 
 * Arrests and the differences that are tear-ing the Party asunder have in many ways weakened the activity of the local Social-Democratic organisations. 
 In its fight against the ‘Majori-ty’ the local ‘Minority’ tries, for its own factional purposes, to discredit our local Committee. 
 District representatives who adhere to the ‘Minority’ do not admit comrades of the ‘Majority’ into their districtsand do not supply the Committee with any contacts. 
 The result is terrible disorganisation and lowered efficiency in the districts concerned. 
 The following is a case in point. 
 For the last five or six months therepresentative of one district has been a ‘Menshevik’. 
 Due to the fact that it has been out of touch with the genera] activity, this district has lost ground terribly. 
 Where there were formerly from fifteen to twentystudy circles, there are now barely from four to five. 
 The workers are dissatisfied with this state of affairs, and their representative is seeking to exploit this dissatisfaction against the ‘Majority’ by settingthe workers against the Committee. 
 The ‘Minority’ seeks to turn every weakness in the local Social-Democratic organisation to account against the ‘Majority’. 
 Whether its attempts are successful or not isanother matter, but the fact remains that this is so. 
 “Three days before the demonstration, the Committee was called together on the initiative of the ‘Minority’. 
 For certain reasons threemembers of the ‘Majority’ on the Committee could not be notified in advance and were absent. 
 The ‘Minority’ made a motion to call off the demonstration, threatening, otherwise, to work against it and notdistribute a single leaflet. 
 Owing to the absence of the three comrades that would have supported the demonstration, the motion was carried. 
 It was decided not to distribute any leaflets and to destroy those con-taining the call. 
 “The broad mass of the general public, as well as the workers, pre-pared to attend the demonstration and waited only for the Committee’scall. 
 Rumours began to circulate that the demonstration had been called off and indefinitely postponed. 
 Many strongly objected to the cancellation; the technical workers 15 protested and refused to work for the Committee in the future. 
 “A meeting of the Committee was called on Friday, and the three members who had been absent at the previous meeting protestedagainst the improper revision of the decision to hold the demonstration. 
 *The Russian terms for “majority” and “minority” are, respec-tively, bolshinstvo and menshinstvo . 
 Hence, Lenin’s adherents, who ob-tained a majority of votes in the elections to the leading organs of the Party at the Second Congress of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 held in London in1903, were called Bolsheviks, and their opponents, the minority, were Ed Since a mass of people would gather in Nevsky Prospekt anyway, even if no leaflets were distributed, they urged that all steps be taken to get the workers as well to participate in the demonstration. 
 A representa-tive of the ‘Minority’ objected on the grounds that ‘ not all workers are sufficiently developed to participate consciously in the demonstration and to be able to defend the demands put forward by the Committee ’. 
 The question was put to the vote; the meeting decided, with only oneopposing vote, to hold the demonstration. 
 But it transpired that many of the printed leaflets—over 12,000—containing the call had been burnt. 
 Besides, their mass distribution at the factories was impossible, sincethey could not be delivered anywhere by Saturday morning, and on Saturdays the factories stop work at two or three o’clock. 
 Thus, the leaflets could be distributed only among a small circle of workers,among acquaintances, but not among the broad masses. 
 Under the circumstances the demonstration was foredoomed to failure. 
 And fail it did.... 
 “Now our ‘Minority’ can rejoice. 
 It has won! Here is a new fact that discredits the Committee (read: the ‘Majority’). 
 But we hope that the reader will consider more seriously the reasons why the demonstrationturned out as it did, and will say with us: ‘Yes, as things now are in the Party it is impossible to work with any success. 
 We must put an end to the crisis within the Party as soon as possible, we must close ourranks, otherwise we are in danger of complete enfeeblement and, unless we take advantage of the present favourable moment, we shall find our-selves trailing at the tail-end of great events. 
’” This disruptive act of the St. 
 Petersburg “Minority”, which, in their own petty factional interests, prevented a proletarian demonstration, is the last drop that should makethe cup of the Party’s patience run over. 
 That our Party is seriously ill and has lost a good half of its influence during the past year is known to the whole world. 
 We appeal now tothose who are incapable of regarding this serious ailment with sneers or malicious joy, who cannot dismiss the accursed questions of the Party crisis with mere sighs and shakes ofthe head, with snivelling and whining, who consider it their duty, even at the cost of a supreme effort, to achieve full clarity on the causes of the crisis—to fulfil that duty andpluck up the evil by its roots. 
 For these people, and these people only , we shall recapitulate the history of the crisis; for without studying this history it is impossible to understandthe present split, which the “Mensheviks” have finally con-trived to bring about. 
 First stage of the crisis: At the Second Congress of our Party the principles of the Iskra position win, despite the opposition of the Rabocheye Dyelo and semi-Rabocheye Dyelo people. 
 After the Congress, the Minority begins to tear the Party asunder over the question of bringing into the Edi-torial Board persons whom the Congress rejected. 
 Disorgani-sation, boycott, and preparation for a split go on for three months , from the end of August to the end of November. 
 Second stage: Plekhanov yields to the gentlemen who yearn for co-optation and makes manifest to all in public print,in the article “What Should Not Be Done” (No. 
 52), that he is offering a personal concession to the revisionists and anarch-ists-individualists in order to avert a greater evil. 
 Thegentlemen take advantage of this concession to go on rendingthe Party. 
 Having taken their seats on the Editorial Boardof the Central Organ and on the Council of the Party, theyform a secret organisation for the purpose of getting their people into the Central Committee and obstructing the ThirdCongress. 
 Unheard-of and incredible though it may be, thisfact is proved by documentary evidence in the form of aletter of the new Central Committee concerning deals madewith this worthy crew. 
 Third stage: Three members of the Central Committee side with the conspirators against the Party. 
 They co-opt three pretenders from the Minority (assuring the committees, in writing, of the contrary), and, with the aid of the Council,decidedly obstruct the Third Congress , which was favoured by the overwhelming majority of the committees that voicedtheir opinions on the crisis. 
 In Orlovsky’s 16 pamphlet ( The Council Against the Party ) and in Lenin’s ( Statement and Documents on the Break of the Central Institutions with theParty *), these facts are likewise proved by documentary evi-dence. 
 The mass of the Party workers in Russia are unawareof these facts, but they should be known to everyone whowishes to be a Party member in more than name. 
 Fourth stage: The Party workers in Russia unite for action against the group abroad which has disgraced our Party. 
The adherents and the Committees of the Majority arrange several private conferences and elect representatives. 
 The new Central Committee, which is controlled completely bythe co-opted pretenders, makes it its business to disorganise *First published in pamphlet form, January 1905, Geneva. 
 See present edition, Vol. 
 7. 
 pp. 
 527-37. 
— Ed. 
 and split all local committees of the Majority . 
 The comrades should not entertain any illusions on this score; the Central Committee has no other purpose. 
 The creatures of the clique abroad are preparing and forming new committees everywhere(in Odessa, Baku, Ekaterinoslav, Moscow, Voronezh, etc. 
). 
The group abroad is preparing its own, hand-picked congress. 
The secret organisation, having finished with the centralbodies, has turned against the local committees. 
 The disruptive trick of the St. 
 Petersburg Mensheviks is no accident; it is a calculated step towards splitting the Com-mittee, a move made with the help of the “Mensheviks” co-opted into the Central Committee. 
 We repeat: The Partyworkers in Russia in their majority are unaware of thesefacts. 
 We warn them and say to them most emphatically that everyone who wishes to struggle for the Party and against disorganisation, everyone who does not want to beutterly duped, must know all these facts. 
 We have made all possible concessions and several quite impossible ones in order to continue working in one partywith the “Minority”. 
 Now that the Third Congress has been obstructed and the disruptive tactics have been directed against the local committees, all hope of achieving this islost. 
 Unlike the “Mensheviks”, who work by underhandmeans, behind the Party’s back, we must declare openlyand prove by deeds that the Party has broken off any andall relations with these gentry. 
 Vperyod , No. 
 1, January 4, 1905 Published according to (December 22, 1904 ) the text in Vperyod CONFERENCES OF THE COMMITTEES17 Three conferences of local committees of our Party have re-cently been held: (1) the conference of the four Caucasiancommittees, (2) the conference of the three southern committees(Odessa, Ekaterinoslav, and Nikolayev), and (3) the confer-ence of the six northern committees (St. 
 Petersburg, Moscow, Tver, Riga, the North, and Nizhni-Novgorod). 
 We hope short-ly to be able to give detailed information about theseconferences. 
 18 For the time being we can report that all three conferences emphatically went on record for the imme-diate convocation of the Third Congress of the Party and insupport of the publicists group of the “Majority”.

 1, January 4, 1905 Published according to (December 22, 1904 ) the text in Vperyod THE NEW RUSSIAN LOAN Under the above headline, the Frankfurter Zeitung , mouthpiece of the big German stockjobbers, gives the follow-ing interesting report: “Rumours of a new big Russian loan have been current for several weeks now. 
 All these rumours were promptly denied. 
 It is now officially admitted, however, that a loan was recent-ly [reported on December 29, new style] negotiated in St. 
Petersburg. 
 No doubt, these official negotiations were preced-ed by private inquiries, which gave rise to the rumours. 
It is reported that German financiers took part this time inthe negotiations. 
 The loan is to be floated on the German market. 
 Until now, since the beginning of the war, Russia has raised funds in three different ways: first, about 300 mil-lion rubles was borrowed from the cash holdings of the Treas-ury, increased by cuts in previous allocations. 
 This wasfollowed by a loan of 800 million francs (about 300 millionrubles) obtained through French bankers. 
 In August Russia floated a domestic loan of 150 million rubles. 
 The war is consuming heavy sums which are growing from month tomonth, and Russia is again planning to raise a big foreignloan. 
 Russian stocks have recently shown a strong (serious,bedenkliche ) downward trend. 
 How the German public will react to the Russian loan is unpredictable. 
 The fortunes of war, so far, have invariably favoured the Japanese. 
 And whereas, so far, Russian loans have been considered a safe in-vestment, they are now becoming more or less speculative ( Bei-geschmack ), especially in view of the tsar’s recent Manifesto, which throws characteristic light on what is going on in Rus-sia. 
 It remains to be seen whether the new loan will be offered to the German public on terms (the interest rate and the price of issue) that would make up for the impaired quality of theRussian loan. 
” — — — Another warning to the Russian autocracy by the European bourgeoisie! It is losing credit as a result both of the military defeats and of the growing discontent within the country. 
 The European bankers are beginning to regard the autocracyas a gambling speculation, while the “quality” of Russianloans, in the sense of their reliability, is frankly declared tobe impaired. 
 And what a mass of money this criminal war, which must be consuming no less than three million rubles a day , is still going to cost the people! Written after December 16 (29), 1904 First published in 1931 Published according to in Lenin Miscellany XVI the manuscript TO A.

 BOGDANOV January 10, 1905 My dear friend, At last we have launched Vperyod , and I would like to dis-cuss it with you in greater detail. 
 Issue No. 
 2 will appear theday after tomorrow. 
 We intend to bring it out weekly. 
 We have sufficient literary forces for the task. 
 We are all in excellent spirits and at the top of our working form (with theslight exception of Vasily Vasilyevich, 19 who has a touch of the blues). 
 We are sure that things will go well, so long as wedon’t go bankrupt. 
 We need 400 francs (150 rubles) per issue,but we have only 1,200 francs all in all. 
 We shall need the deuce of a lot of help for the first few months; for, unless we can make it a regular publication, the entire position of theMajority will be dealt a terrific, well-nigh irreparable blow. 
Do not forget this and get whatever you can ( e s p e c i a l l y f r o m G o r k y ). 
 Next. 
 It is particularly important now to let Rakhmetov 20 know that he should push on as hard as he can with the arrange-ments for literary contributions from Russia. 
 The successof a weekly depends largely upon the energetic collaborationof Russian writers and Social-Democrats. 
 Write to Rakhme-tov that he should mobilise both F i n n and K o l l o n t a i for the purpose (we badly need articles o n F i n l a n d ), as well as R u m y a n t s e v and A n d r e i S o k o l o v , the latter especially and particularly. 
 I know by long experiencethat the people in Russia are devilishly, unpardonably, andincredibly slow at this sort of thing. 
 It is therefore necessaryto act, first of all, by personal example; secondly, not to relyon promises, but to see that you get the things written. 
 Let Rakhmetov be sure to order the articles and the correspond-ence himself, and receive them himself, and send them offhimself, keeping at it until he gets the material. 
 (I would also add S u v o r o v and L u n t s , but I am sure Rakhmetov knows many others besides. 
) We badly need: (1) articles on questions of Russian life, from 6,000 to 18,000 letters; (2) para-graphs on the same subjects, from 2,000 to 6,000 letters;(3) correspondence of diverse length about everything; (4)interesting passages and quotations from local Russian andspecial Russian publications; (5) paragraphs on articles inRussian newspapers and magazines. 
 The last three points are quite within the range of contribution by working-class and especially the student youth, and therefore the thing shouldbe given attention; this work should be popularised, peopleshould be roused and filled with zeal; they should, by con-crete example, be taught what is wanted and how necessary itis to utilise every trifle; they should be made to see how badly needed the raw material from Russia is abroad (we shall be able to work it up from a literary angle and make use of itourselves), that it is foolish in the extreme to feel embarrassedabout literary shortcomings, that they must learn to speaksimply and correspond simply with the periodical abroad ifthey wish to make it their own journal. 
 In view of this I would consider it simply necessary and positively essential to hand out a Vperyod address (a foreign address, of which we have many now and shall have more) to every student circle and to every workers’ group. 
 I assure you that there is an idiotic prejudice among our committee-men against handingout addresses on a broad scale to the periphery youth. 
 Com-bat this prejudice with all your might, hand out the addresses, and demand direct contact with the Editorial Board of Vperyod . 
 Unless this is done there will be no newspaper. 
 Workers’ correspondence is very badly needed, and there isso little of it. 
 What we need is scores and hundreds of workerscorresponding directly with Vperyod . 
 We must also get the workers to communicate their own addresses to which Vperyod may be mailed in closed enve-lopes. 
 The workers will not be afraid. 
 The police will not beable to intercept a tenth of the envelopes. 
 The small (four-page) size and frequent appearance of Vperyod make the question of envelope delivery a most vital one for our newspaper. 
 We should make it our direct objective to develop workers’ subscriptions to Vperyod , to develop the habit of sending the money (a ruble isn’t something God knows what!) and one’s address abroad. 
 If we tackle this properly, my word, we could revolutionise the distribution of underground literature in Russia. 
 Don’t forget that transportation, at best, takes four months. 
 And that’s with a weekly paper! As forthe enveloped copies, probably from 50 to 75 per cent will bedelivered at postal speed. 
 Now, as to the writers. 
 They ought simply to be obligated to write regularly once a week or once a fortnight; other-wise—so, indeed, tell them—we cannot consider them decent people and will have nothing more to do with them. 
 Theusual excuse is: We don’t know what theme to choose, we’reafraid to waste our effort, we think “they already have this”. 
It is against these trite and idiotic pretexts that Rakhmetovmust wage a personal, a definitely personal, fight. 
 The prin-cipal themes are the domestic topics of Russia (of the kind that comprise in periodical literature reviews of the domesticpolitical scene and reflections of social life), as well as arti-cles and brief comments on material appearing in Russianspecial publications (statistical, military, medical, prison,ecclesiastical, and other periodicals). 
 We are always in need of copy for these two sections. 
 Only people living in Russia, and such people alone, can conduct these two sections well. 
The keynote here is fresh facts , fresh impressions , special materials that are inaccessible to the people abroad , and not just arguments , not evaluations from the Social-Democratic point of view . 
 Therefore, such articles and comments will never go to waste, for we shall always make use of them. 
 It is Rakhmetov’s duty now to organise this thing at onceand give us at least half a dozen good, useful contributors,who would not be lazy or try to shirk their jobs, but wouldeach get in direct touch with the Editorial Board. 
 Only bydirect contact with contributors can we arrange all the details of the work. 
 People should be enlisted by being made to realise that nowhere else can they “get into print” as quicklyas in a weekly newspaper. 
 In conclusion, a word or two about the organisational slo-gan of today.

 explain again, and hammer it into their heads as hard as he can. 
 The split is now complete ; for we have exhausted all means. 
 It is the Third Congress against the will of the Central Committee and the Council and without them . 
 Complete rup-ture with the Central Committee. 
 An open statement that wehave our own Bureau. 
 The complete removal of the Menshe-viks and the new-Iskrists everywhere. 
 We did everything wecould to get on together, and should now declare openly and bluntly that we are obliged to work separately. 
 All trustful-ness and naïveté can only cause tremendous harm. 
 For Christ’s sake hurry up and issue an open and emphatic statement on the Bureau. 
 21 It is necessary: (1) to line up fully with “Time to Call a Halt!” and re-issue its appeal; (2)to declare that Vperyod is the organ of the majority of the com-mittees and that the Bureau is working with it in complete and friendly agreement; (3) that the C. 
C. 
 and the Council havedeceived the Party in the most disgraceful way and sabo-taged the Congress; (4) that there is no way out now otherthan the convening of a congress of the committees them-selves without the C. 
C. 
 and the Council; (5) that the Bureau undertakes to help the constructive work of the committees; (6) that the Central Organ has utterly lost the membership’sconfidence by its vacillations and lies. 
 Believe me, we highly appreciate Zemlyachka, but she is wrong in her opposition to Papasha, 22 and it is for you to correct her mistakes. 
 Let us hurry up and break with the C.

 all along the line, and publish a statement about the Bureau at once to the effect that it is the Organising Commit-tee and that it is convening the Third Congress.

 3 (38) THE FALL OF PORT ARTHUR23 “Port Arthur has surrendered. 
 “This event is one of the greatest events in modern history. 
 These four words, flashed yesterday to all parts of the civil-ised world, create a crushing impression, the impression of an overwhelming and appalling catastrophe, a disaster that beg-gars description. 
 The moral power of a mighty empire iscrumbling, the prestige of a young race is waning before ithas had the chance to prove itself. 
 Sentence has been passedupon an entire political system. 
 A long chain of assertedclaims has been broken and mighty efforts have been frust-rated. 
 True, the fall of Port Arthur had long been predicted, and for a long time people had sought to dismiss it in a fewwords and to find consolation in ready-made phrases. 
 But thehard, brutal fact shatters all conventional lies. 
 The sig-nificance of the disaster cannot be underrated now. 
 For thefirst time the old world has been humiliated by an irreparable defeat dealt it by the new world, a world mysterious, and, to all appearances, adolescent, which was only yesterday wonto civilisation. 
” Thus writes a respectable European bourgeois newspaper under the direct impact of the event. 
 Admittedly, it has donemore than merely express in trenchant words the sentiments of the entire European bourgeoisie. 
 Through the words of this newspaper speaks the true class instinct of the bourgeoi-sie of the old world, which is perturbed by the victories ofthe new bourgeois world and alarmed by the collapse of Rus-sia’s military power, which for a long time had been consid-ered the bulwark of European reaction. 
 Small wonder that even the European bourgeoisie, which has taken no part in the war, feels humiliated and depressed. 
 It had grown soaccustomed to identify Russia’s moral strength with the military strength of the gendarme of Europe. 
 In its eyes the prestige of the young Russian race was inseparably bound up with that of tsarism, that unshakable authority, which strongly safeguarded the existing “order of things”. 
 Smallwonder that the disaster which has overtaken the rulers andcommanders of Russia seems “appalling” to the wholeEuropean bourgeoisie. 
 This disaster implies a tremendousacceleration of world-wide capitalist development, a quicken-ing of history’s pace; and the bourgeoisie knows only too well from bitter experience that this means the acceleration of thesocial revolution of the proletariat. 
 The bourgeoisie ofWestern Europe felt so secure in the atmosphere of long-lasting stagnation, under the wing of the “mighty Empire”,and now suddenly some “mysterious, adolescent” power dares to disturb this stagnation and shatter this pillar. 
 Indeed, the European bourgeoisie has cause for alarm. 
 The proletariat has cause for rejoicing. 
 The disaster that hasovertaken our mortal enemy not only signifies the approachof freedom in Russia, it also presages a new revolutionaryupsurge of the European proletariat. 
 But why and to what extent is the fall of Port Arthur real-ly an historic disaster? The first thing that strikes the eye is the effect of this event on the trend of the war. 
 The main objective of the Japanese inthis war has been attained. 
 Advancing, progressive Asia hasdealt backward and reactionary Europe an irreparable blow. 
 Ten years ago this reactionary Europe, with Russia in the lead, was perturbed by the defeat of China at the hands ofyoung Japan, and it united to rob Japan of the best fruits ofher victory. 
 Europe was protecting the established relationsand privileges of the old world, its prerogative to exploit theAsian peoples—a prerogative held from time immemorial and sanctified by the usage of centuries. 
 The recovery of Port Arthur by Japan is a blow struck at the whole of reactionaryEurope. 
 Russia held Port Arthur for six years and spenthundreds of millions of rubles on the building of strategicrailways, harbours, and new towns, on fortifying a strong-hold which the entire mass of European newspapers, bribed by Russia and fawning on Russia, declared to be impreg-nable. 
 Military commentators write that Port Arthur was asstrong as six Sevastopols. 
 And behold, little Japan, hitherto despised by all, captures this stronghold in eight months, when it took England and France together a whole year to capture Sevastopol. 
 The military blow is irreparable. 
 The question of supremacy on the seas, the main and vital issueof the present war, has been settled. 
 The Russian Pacificfleet, which at the outset was certainly not weaker, if ac-tually not stronger, than the Japanese fleet, has been com-pletely destroyed. 
 The very base for naval operations has been lost, and the only thing left for Rozhdestvensky’s naval squadron is to turn back shamefully after a uselessexpenditure of more millions, after the great victory of hisformidable battleships over the English fishing smacks. 
It is believed that Russia’s loss in naval tonnage aloneamounts to 300,000,000 rubles. 
 More important, however, is the loss of some ten thousand of the navy’s best men, and the loss of an entire army. 
 Many European papers are nowtrying to minimise the importance of these losses, and theirefforts to do so lead them to such ridiculous assertions as thatKuropatkin is now “relieved”, “freed” of his worries over PortArthur! Russia’s military forces have also been relieved of an entire army. 
 According to the latest English reports, no fewer than 48, 000 m e n have been taken prisoner, and there is no telling how many thousands more were killed in the battlesof Kinchow and at the fortress itself. 
 The Japanese are in com-plete possession of the Liaotung Peninsula; they have acquireda base of operations of incalculable importance for exerting pressure on Korea, China, and Manchuria; they have released for action against Kuropatkin a battle-tried army of from80,000 to 100,000 strong, reinforced by formidable heavyartillery which, when brought up to the Shaho River, will givethem an overwhelming superiority over the main Russianforces. 
 According to reports in the foreign press, the autocratic government has decided to continue the war at all costs, andto send Kuropatkin 200,000 more men. 
 It is highly probablethat the war will drag on for a long time, but its hopelessnessis already apparent, and all delays will only aggravate theinnumerable calamities which the Russian people are suffer-ing because they still tolerate the yoke of the autocracy on their neck. 
 As it is, the Japanese have reinforced their troopsafter every big battle in less time and in greater numbers than the Russians. 
 And now that they have achieved com-plete supremacy on the sea and have utterly annihilated one of Russia’s armies, they will be able to send twice as many reinforcements as the Russians. 
 As it is, the Japanese beatthe Russian generals time and again, although the bulk oftheir best artillery was engaged in siege warfare. 
 Now theyhave achieved complete concentration of their forces, whilethe Russians have to fear for Vladivostok, as well as for Sakhalin. 
 The Japanese have occupied the best and most pop-ulated part of Manchuria, where they can maintain an armyat the expense of the conquered territory and with the help ofChina, whereas the Russians have to depend more and moreupon supplies transported from Russia, and it will soon beimpossible for Kuropatkin to increase his army any further, in view of the impossibility of bringing up sufficient sup-plies. 
 But the military debacle which the autocracy has suffered has deeper implications; it signifies the collapse of our entirepolitical system. 
 The days when wars were fought by merce-naries or by representatives of a caste half-isolated from the people have gone for ever. 
 Wars today are fought by peoples; even Kuropatkin, according to Nemirovich-Danchenko,has begun to realise that this is the truth and not a merecopy-book motto. 
 Wars today are fought by peoples; this nowbrings out more strikingly than ever a great attribute of war,namely, that it opens the eyes of millions to the disparity between the people and the government, which heretofore was evident only to a small class-conscious minority. 
 Thecriticism of the autocracy by all progressive Russians, by theRussian Social-Democrats, by the Russian proletariat, hasnow been confirmed in the criticism by Japanese arms, con-firmed in such wise that the impossibility of living under the autocracy is felt more and more even by those who do not know what autocracy means, even by those who do know, butyet would maintain it with all their soul. 
 The incompatibil-ity of the autocracy with the interests of social development,with the interests of the entire people (apart from a handfulof bureaucrats and bigwigs), became evident as soon as the people actually had to pay for the autocracy with their life-blood. 
 Its foolish and criminal colonial adventure has landedthe autocracy in an impasse, from which the people can ex-tricate themselves only by their own efforts and only at the cost of destroying tsarism. 
 The fall of Port Arthur is a great historic outcome of tsar-ism’s crimes, which began to reveal themselves at the outsetof the war, and which will now reveal themselves more andmore extensively and unrestrainedly. 
 After us the deluge!argued all the big and little Alexeyevs, 24 scarcely thinking or believing that the deluge would actually come. 
 The generals and commanders-in-chief proved themselves incompetent nonentities. 
 In the expert opinion of an English militaryobserver (in The Times ), the whole story of the 1904 campaign was one of criminal neglect of the elementary principles ofnaval and military strategy. 
 The civil and military bureau-cracy proved as parasitic and venal now as in the days of serfdom. 
 The officers proved uneducated, undeveloped, and untrained. 
 They were not in close touch with the soldiers, nordid they enjoy their confidence. 
 The ignorance, illiteracy,and backwardness of the peasant masses became appallinglyobvious when they came up against a progressive nation inmodern warfare, which requires high-quality manpower as imperatively as does modern technique. 
 Success in modern warfare is impossible without intelligent soldiers and sailorswho possess initiative. 
 No amount of endurance or physicalstrength, no herding of men into solid ranks for mass actionscan guarantee superiority in an age of quick-firing smallarms and quick-firing cannon, when naval battles are fought with the aid of intricate mechanisms and land actions are fought in extended order. 
 The military might of autocraticRussia has proved to be a sham. 
 Tsarism has proved to be ahindrance to the organisation of up-to-date efficient warfare,that very business to which tsarism dedicated itself so whole-heartedly, of which it was so proud, and for which it offered such colossal sacrifices in defiance to all opposition on the part of the people. 
 A whited sepulchre is what tsarism hasproved to be in the field of external defence, which was itsfavourite speciality, so to say. 
 Events have corroborated theopinion of those foreigners who laughed upon seeing hun-dreds of millions squandered on the purchase and building of splendid warships, and who declared that those expenditures were useless if no one knew how to manipulate such modernvessels, if there were no people with the necessary technical knowledge to utilise the latest achievements of military engi-neering. 
 Both the navy and the fortress, the field fortifica-tions and the army proved to be antiquated and utterly useless. 
 Never before has the military organisation of a country had such a close bearing on its entire economic and culturalsystem. 
 The military debacle, therefore, could not but pre-cipitate a profound political crisis. 
 Here again, as so often in history, the war between an advanced and a backward country has played a great revolutionary role. 
 And the class-consciousproletariat, an implacable enemy of war—this inevitableand inseverable concomitant of all class rule in general—can-not shut its eyes to the revolutionary task which the Japanesebourgeoisie, by its crushing defeat of the Russian autocracy, is carrying out. 
 The proletariat is hostile to every bourgeoi-sie and to all manifestations of the bourgeois system, butthis hostility does not relieve it of the duty of distinguishingbetween the historically progressive and the reactionary rep-resentatives of the bourgeoisie. 
 It is quite understandable,therefore, that the most consistent and staunch representa-tives of revolutionary international Social-Democracy, such as Jules Guesde in France and Hyndman in England, unequivoc-ally expressed their sympathy with Japan, which is routingthe Russian autocracy. 
 Here in Russia, of course, somesocialists were found to have muddled ideas on this question,too. 
 Revolutsionnaya Rossiya 25 rebuked Guesde and Hynd-man, saying that a socialist could only be in favour of a workers’ Japan, a people’s Japan, and not of a bourgeoisJapan. 
 This rebuke is as absurd as blaming a socialist foradmitting the progressive nature of the free-trade bourgeoisieas compared with the protectionist bourgeoisie. 
 Guesde andHyndman did not defend the Japanese bourgeoisie or Japa-nese imperialism; they correctly noted in this conflict between two bourgeois countries the historically progressiverole of one of them. 
 The muddle-headedness of the “Social-ists-Revolutionaries” was, of course, an inevitable result ofthe failure on the part of our radical intelligentsia to under-stand the class point of view and historical materialism. 
 Neither could the new Iskra help showing muddled thinking. 
 It had quite a lot to say at first about peace at any price. 
It then made haste to “correct itself”, when Jaurès showed plainly whose interests, those of the progressive or those of the reactionary bourgeoisie, would be served by a quasi-socialist campaign for peace in general. 
 And now it has ended up with platitudes about the unreasonableness of“speculating” (?!) on a victory of the Japanese bourgeoisieand about war being a calamity “regardless of whether”it ends in the victory or the defeat of the autocracy. 
 No. 
 The cause of Russian freedom and of the struggle of the Russian (and the world) proletariat for socialism depends to a very large extent on the military defeats of the autoc-racy. 
 This cause has been greatly advanced by the militarydebacle which has struck terror in the hearts of all the Euro-pean guardians of the existing order. 
 The revolutionaryproletariat must carry on a ceaseless agitation against war, always keeping in mind, however, that wars are inevitable as long as class rule exists. 
 Trite phrases about peace à la Jaurès are of no use to the oppressed class, which is not responsiblefor a bourgeois war between two bourgeois nations, which isdoing all it can to overthrow every bourgeoisie, which knowsthe enormity of the people’s sufferings even in time of “peace-ful” capitalist exploitation. 
 While struggling against free competition, we cannot, however, forget its progressive char-acter in comparison with the semi-feudal system. 
 Whilestruggling against every war and every bourgeoisie, we mustdraw a clear line in our agitational work between the progress-ive bourgeoisie and the feudal autocracy; we must recognise the great revolutionary role of the historic war in which the Russian worker is an involuntary participant. 
 It was the Russian autocracy and not the Russian people that started this colonial war, which has turned into a warbetween the old and the new bourgeois worlds. 
 It is theautocratic regime and not the Russian people that has suf-fered ignoble defeat. 
 The Russian people has gained from the defeat of the autocracy. 
 The capitulation of Port Arthur isthe prologue to the capitulation of tsarism. 
 The war is notended yet by far, but every step towards its continuationincreases immeasurably the unrest and discontent among theRussian people, brings nearer the hour of a new great war, the war of the people against the autocracy, the war of the proletariat for liberty. 
 There is good reason for the concernshown by that most sedate and sober European bourgeoisie, which would heartily sympathise with the granting of liberal concessions by the Russian autocracy, but which stands in mortal fear of a Russian revolution, as the pro-logue to a European revolution. 
 “There is a deep-rooted opinion,” writes one such sober organ of the German bourgeoisie, “that it is absolutely impos-sible for a revolution to break out in Russia. 
 Every kind ofargument is used to support this view: the inertness of the Russian peasantry, its faith in the tsar, its dependence on the clergy; the extreme elements among the discontented,it is claimed, constitute a mere handful, who can organiseputsches and terrorist attempts, but are absolutely incapableof calling forth a general popular uprising. 
 The broad mass ofthe discontented, we are told, lack organisation, arms, and— most important of all—the determination to risk their lives. 
 As for the Russian intellectual, he is usually revolutionary-minded only until about the age of thirty, after which he set-tles down comfortably in some cushy government job, andthus most of the hotheads undergo a metamorphosis andbecome run-of-the-mill officials. 
” But now, the newspaper continues, there are many indications of a big change. 
 The revolutionaries are not the only ones now who speak about arevolution in Russia; the topic is even in the mouths of such“unenthusiastic” and solid pillars of law and order as PrinceTrubetskoi, whose letter to the Minister of the Interior is nowbeing reprinted by the entire European press. 
 “There is evi-dently real ground for the fear of a revolution in Russia. 
 True, no one believes that the Russian peasants will take uptheir pitchforks and go forward to fight for a constitution. 
But, then, are revolutions made in villages? In modern his-tory the big cities long ago became the vehicles of the revolu-tionary movement. 
 And in Russia it is the cities that are in ferment, from north to south and from east to west. 
 No one will venture to predict the outcome, but it is an incontrover-tible fact that the number of people who consider a revolu-tion in Russia impossible is diminishing day by day. 
 And ifa serious revolutionary outbreak does occur, it is more thandoubtful whether the autocracy, weakened by the war in the Far East, will be able to cope with it. 
” Yes, the autocracy is weakened. 
 The most sceptical of the sceptics are beginning to believe in the revolution. 
 /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR General belief in revolution is already the beginning of revo-lution. 
 The government itself, by its military adventure, is seeing to its continuation. 
 The Russian proletariat will see to it that the serious revolutionary onset is sustained andextended. 
 Vperyod , No. 
 2, Published according to January 14 (1), 1905 the text in Vperyod FINE WORDS BUTTER NO PARSNIPS We draw the attention of our readers to the pamphlet Work-ers and Intellectuals in Our Organisations , by “A Worker”, which the new-Iskrists have just issued with a foreword byAxelrod. 
 We shall probably have occasion more than once to refer to this edifying tract, which illustrates beautifully what fruits the demagogic preaching of the “Minority”, or new-Iskrists, has borne and continues to bear, and how the latterare now trying to get out of the verbal mess into which theyhave talked themselves. 
 For the present we shall merely notethe main points in the pamphlet and the foreword. 
 “A Worker” had the misfortune to believe the rantings of the new-Iskrists. 
 Hence we find so many Rabocheye Dyelo phrases à la Akimov in his pamphlet. 
 “Our leaders from among the intellectuals ... did not set themselves the task ...of developing the class-consciousness and initiative of theworkers.... 
” Any endeavour to display initiative was “system-atically persecuted”. 
 “In no single type of organisation has there been room for developing independent activity of theworkers.... 
” “The economic struggle was wholly neglected”;“workers were not admitted” even to agitation and propagan-da meetings (who would have believed it!). 
 Demonstrations“have outlived themselves”—all these horrors (which the old Rabocheye Dyelo used to cast in the teeth of the old Iskra long ago) are, of course, the work of “the bureaucratic central-ists”, viz. 
, the majority at our Second Congress, whichfought against Rabocheye Dyelo -ism. 
 Set on against the Party Congress by the sulky minority, the poor “Worker” attacksthis Congress because it was held “without us” (without the workers), “without our participation”, because there was “hardly a single worker” there. 
 Of course, the fact that all thereal worker delegates at the Congress—Stepanov, Gorsky, and Braun—staunchly supported the majority and opposed the spinelessness of the intellectuals is discreetly passed over. 
 But this does not matter. 
 What matters is the depth of depravity that results from the rantings of these new-Iskra people, who “attack” the Congress after being defeated at theelections, who attack it before those who did not participate inthe Congress, inciting them to treat all Social-Democraticcongresses with contempt; who attack it at the very time when they have so nobly wormed their way into the central bodies which act exclusively by authority of the Congress. 
Is not Ryazanov’s stand far more honest? (See his pamphletShattered Illusions . 
) He bluntly declared that the Congress was packed ; but at least he has not been invested by this “packed congress” with any title or office. 
 It is highly characteristic of the psychology of a worker, even though his mind has been turned against the “Majority”,that he is not satisfied with phrases about autonomy, workers’independent activity, etc. 
 He repeats these words like everynew-Iskrist or Rabocheye Dyelo -ist; but with sober proletari-an instinct he insists on deeds in confirmation of words , he does not want his parsnips buttered with fine words. 
 “ With-out a change in the composition ” (“A Worker’s” italics) of the leadership, fine words remain but words, he declares. 
 It isnecessary to demand the admission of workers to all important Party bodies, to secure for them equal rights with the intel-lectuals. 
 With the deep distrust of a true proletarian and a true democrat towards all bombast, “A Worker” exclaims: W h a t g u a r a n t e e is there that the committees will nothave only intellectuals sitting on them? This hits the nail on the head as far as our new-Iskrists are concerned. 
 Thisexcellent question shows that the Rabocheye Dyelo incitements have so far failed to befuddle the clear mind of the prole-tarian. 
 He states bluntly that the committee in which he worked “remained a committee of the Minority only inprinciple, on paper [mark this!], while in its actions itdiffered in no way from a committee of the Majority. 
 Weworkers have had no access to any important, that is tosay leading, Party body (let alone the Committee)”. 
 No one could have shown up the Mensheviks better than this Menshevik worker has done. 
 He understands that without guarantees all this ranting about autonomy and independent activity of the proletariat remains what it is—cheap phrase-mongering. 
 But what guarantees are possible in Social-Democratic organisations—have you ever thought of that, Comrade “Worker”? What guarantees are there that revo-lutionaries who gathered at a Party congress, resentful overthe fact that the Congress did not elect them, will not after-wards shout that the Congress was a reactionary attempt toput over the viewpoint of the Iskrists (see Trotsky’s pamphlet issued under the editorship of the new “Iskra ”), that its deci-sions are not sacred, that there were no workers from amongthe masses at the Congress? What guarantees are there thatthe general decision concerning the forms and guiding rulesof Party organisation, a decision called the OrganisationalRules of the Party and which cannot exist except in the form of such Rules—that this decision is not broken eventually by characterless people, with regard to that part of it which theyfind distasteful, on the pretest that such things as Rules arebureaucratic and formalistic? What guarantees are therethat people who have broken the collectively adopted Rulesof organisation will not afterwards begin to argue that organisation is a process, that organisation is a tendency, that organisation is a form that keeps in step with its content, andthat it is therefore absurd and utopian to demand observance ofthe Rules of organisation? “A Worker”, the author of the pam-phlet, did not ponder over any one of these questions. 
 But heapproached them so closely, so very closely, he put them so bluntly, so candidly and boldly to the phrase-mongers and politicians, that we heartily recommend his pamphlet. 
 Itshows admirably how the knights of the “fine phrase” areexposed by their own followers. 
 “A Worker”, acting on second-hand information, objects to Lenin’s “organisational plan”, but as usual he does not indi-cate a single clear and precise ground for his objection. 
 He mentions Panin and Cherevanin 26 (who have contributed nothing but angry words), but he does not so much as take a glance at Lenin’s much-talked-of letter to a St. 
 Petersburg comrade. 
 If “A Worker” had not taken his abettors at theirword, but had looked at that letter, he would have read, to his great surprise, the following: “We should particularly see to it that as many workers as possible become fully class-conscious and professional revolutionaries and members of the committee . 
 We must try to get on the committee revolutionary workers who have the greatest contacts and the best ‘reputation ’ among the mass of the workers . 
 The committee should , therefore , include , as far as possible , all the principal leaders of the working-class movement from among the workers themselves . 
” (“ Letter ”, pp. 
 7-8). 
 * Read and re-read these lines, Comrade “Worker”, and you will see how you have been hoodwinked by the Rabocheye Dyelo -ists and new-Iskrists, who are attacking the old Iskra and its followers, the “majority” of the Second Congress. 
 Read the lines carefully and see if you will accept the chal-lenge I put forth. 
 Find me another passage in our Social-Democratic literature where the question you raised about “the workers and intellectuals in our organisations” is presented so clearly , directly , and decidedly , and where, moreover, the necessity is pointed out of getting as many workers aspossible on the committee , of getting to the extent possible all leaders of the labour movement from among the workingclass on the committee . 
 I say that you will not be able to point to another such passage . 
 I say that anyone who takes the trouble to study our Party differences from documents,from Rabocheye Dyelo , from Iskra , and from the pamphlets— and not from tales spread by gossips—will see the falsityand the demagogic nature of the new Iskra ’s preaching. 
 You will perhaps answer: Lenin may have written this, but his advice was not always taken. 
 Of course, that is possible. 
No Party writer will vouch that all who call themselveshis adherents always actually follow his counsels. 
 But, in thefirst place, would not a Social-Democrat who called himselfan adherent of the “Letter” while at the same time not follow-ing its counsels be exposed by that very letter? Was the letter printed for intellectuals only, and not for workers as well? Has a writer any means of stating his views other than aprinted statement? Secondly, if these counsels were notheeded, as “A Worker”, for instance, testifies, either by theMensheviks or by the Bolsheviks, does it not clearly followthat the Mensheviks had no right to invent such a “disagree-ment” with the Bolsheviks, that their incitement of the *“Letter to a Comrade on Our Organisational Tasks.

 workers against the Bolsheviks on the grounds that the latter ignored the workers’ independent activity was sheer demagogy? Wherein, then, lies the real difference on this point between the Mensheviks and the Bolsheviks? Is it not in the fact thatthe Bolsheviks came forward much earlier and much moredirectly with clear and definite advice to place workers on thecommittee? Is it not in the fact that the Bolsheviks have al-ways despised “fine phrases” about the workers’ autonomy and independent activity, when such utterances remain merewords (as they do with the Mensheviks)? See now how the respectable, worthy, patriarchal Axel-rod wriggles in his foreword when he is driven into a cornerby the proletarian bluntness and boldness of a worker, who has imbibed so much Rabocheye Dyelo wisdom from Axel-rod’s “admirable” feuilletons , Martov’s unforgettable arti-cles, and (from the point of view of the interests of the“Majority”) Trotsky’s excellent pamphlet. 
 “A Worker” tries to question Ryadovoi’s 27 assertion that since the time of Economism the membership of our Party organisation has become relatively more proletarian. 
 “A Worker” is obviously wrong. 
 Anyone who has observedthe activities of our Party at close range for any length oftime knows this. 
 Most curious of all, however, is the sight ofour old Axelrod changing front. 
 Who does not remember hisstout assertions, so skilfully utilised by the enemies of Social-Democracy, the Osvobozhdeniye liberals, that the Social-Democratic Party is an organisation of intellectuals? Whodoes not remember how the new-Iskrists, with their grudgeagainst the Party, harped on this slander of the Party? Andnow the selfsame Axelrod, frightened by the direct and honestconclusions which “A Worker” has drawn from this slander, tries to dodge the issue: “During the period of the inception and early development of Social-Democracy,” he says in his foreword, “the Russianrevolutionary party was purely a party of the intelligent-sia.... 
 Now the class-conscious revolutionary workers formthe main body [mark this!] of the Social-Democratic Party” (op. 
 cit. 
 , p. 
 15). 
 Poor “Worker”! How severe his punishment is for having believed Axelrod’s “fine words”! Such punishment is the inev-itable consequence of trust in writers who for a year and a half have been saying first one thing then another to suit the exigencies of “co-optation”. 
 See how Axelrod dodges the question of “guarantees” when he has to meet it outright. 
 Why, it is a positive delight, a gemof new-Iskra literature. 
 “A Worker” speaks of the relation between the workers and the intellectuals within the organi-sations . 
 “A Worker” is profoundly correct in declaring that without guarantees, without equal rights, i. 
e. 
, without the principle of elective office, all fine words about non-bureau-cratic centralism are mere phrase-mongering. 
 And whatdoes Axelrod say in answer? “Over-zealousness for the idea of change in the status of the workers in our organisations isone-sidedness. 
” The author erroneously shifts the issue of eradicating evil “into the sphere of formal organisational re-lations”; he forgets that “the particular question of equal-isation of rights” can be solved only “in the process of thefurther development of our experience in a Social-Democraticdirection”. 
 “The problem that particularly engages theauthor of the pamphlet can be radically dealt with only in the process of consciously collective work by our Party. 
” Truly a gem! Why, it was none other than Axelrod who was the first to raise this very question of organisation, and onlyof organisation, at the League Congress * and in the new Iskra (No. 
 55); but when “A Worker” writes a special pamphlet onorganisation, he is told pontifically that it is not formality that counts, but the process of work! It is not the principles of organisation that matter to the new Iskra and to Axelrod, but the process of twaddle to justify an unprincipled stand. 
 There is no meaning except adefence of unprincipledness in the whole notorious organisa-tion-as-process theory (see particularly Rosa Luxemburg’s articles), a theory that vulgarises and prostitutes Marx-ism. 
 We repeat, “A Worker’s” admirable pamphlet cannot be recommended too highly as evidence of the utter falsenessof the new-Iskrist position on the organisational question. 
We recommend this pamphlet particularly to workers whom the Mensheviks are trying to turn against the Bolsheviks by *See Note 52. 
— Ed. 
 preaching the elective principle. 
 * The workers are splendid at exposing phrase-mongers and liars. 
 They put the question excellently: either the elective principle or only the advice to place workers on the committees. 
 If it is to be the electiveprinciple, give us formal guarantees, guarantees of equalityembodied in the Rules. 
 The workers will see the new-Iskristsrunning from a solution of this question as the devil runsfrom holy water. 
 If advice to place workers on the commit-tees is desirable, if the old Iskra was right in maintaining that democracy, i. 
e. 
, the universal application of the elec-tive principle in Russian secret organisations, is incompati-ble with the autocratic police-ridden regime, then nowhere will you find such direct and instructive advice to place work-ers on the committees as that given by the Majority.

 Lenin, Statement and Documents on the Break of the Cen-pamphlet reads as follows: “... the workers are demanding the system Stone-Hards”. 
 I belong to the Stone-Hards, but this agony satisfies me very well. 
 The workers’ demand that offices be elective shows plainly that the new-Iskrists did not succeed in buttering the workers’ pars-nips with fine words, and that no evasions can now save Axelrod fromcomplete exposure.

 I. 
 1905 * Dear Comrades, We are unable to call a meeting of the Editorial Board to answer your inquiry, and I therefore take the liberty of an-swering you myself. 
 The Zurich group of Bolsheviks asks“what our attitude is to the Central Organ and the CentralCommittee; whether we consider them as existing legiti-mately but operating illegitimately and are in opposition tothem, or whether we refuse to recognise them altogether as Party centres. 
” It seems to me that your question savours somewhat of casuistry. 
 The announcement of the newspaper Vperyod 28 and the first issue (“Time to Call a Halt!” **), together with my Statement and Documents ,*** would seem to have answered this question in substance . 
 The leading centres (the Central Organ, the Central Committee, and the Council) have broken with the Party, sabotaged the Second and the Third Congresses, duped the Party in the most brazen way,and usurped their snug jobs in a truly Bonapartist manner. 
How can one speak here of the legitimate existence of thecentres? Is a swindler the legitimate owner of the money he has pocketed on a forged note? It seems strange to me that the Zurich Bolsheviks should still be puzzled, after this question has been thrashed out again and again. 
 That the centres did not want to submit tothe Party has been proved conclusively. 
 Then what are we to *Geneva, January 18, 1905.

 do? Convene the Third Congress? They have deceived us on that score, too. 
 One thing remains—to break with the Men-sheviks as completely , as quickly, and as definitely (openly, publicly) as possible, and to convene our own Third PartyCongress, without the consent of the central bodies andwithout their participation, to begin immediately (without waiting for this centre either) to work with our own Partycentres, the Editorial Board of Vperyod , and the Russian Bureau elected by the Northern Conference. 
 I repeat: the centres have put themselves o u t s i d e the Par-ty. 
 There is no middle ground; one is either with the centresor with the Party. 
 It is time to draw the line of demarcationand, unlike the Mensheviks, who are splitting the Partysecretly, to accept their challenge openly. 
 Yes, a split, for you have gone the whole hog with your splitting. 
 Yes, a split, for we have exhausted all means of delay and of obtaining a Par-ty decision (by a Third Congress). 
 Yes, a split, for everywhere the disgusting squabbles with the disorganisers have onlyharmed the cause. 
 We have received letters from St. 
 Peters-burg saying that things have taken a turn for the better since the split, that one can work without squabbles, with peo-ple whom one trusts. 
 Is not this perfectly clear? Down withthe Bonapartists and the disorganisers! Let us know whether you are satisfied with this answer. 
It is essential that the groups of the Majority abroad close their ranks. 
 Write about the issue immediately to the Berne comrades (Herrn Kazakow, Bäckereiweg, 1. 
 Bern). 
 They are already at it and will answer you better than I can. 
We must tackle the matter more energetically. 
 Correspondwith all the groups, spur them on in regard to money andmaterial, initiate groups in new places, etc. 
 We likewise have begun to feel much better since we broke decisively with the Minority. 
 We heartily wish you, too, a speedy riddance of them. 
 I clasp your hand, Yours, N.

 Please give my special personal regards to Meyerson. 
 How is he getting on? Does he feel better? I am angry at Steiner—tell her it’s disgusting; she promised to write about Nikolayev by Christmas, and we’re nearly at the end of January! The Berne group has undertaken to unite the Bolsheviks abroad, under the leadership of the Bureau, of course. 
 Askthe Berne group for their letter to us on this question andthe answer of the Geneva group. 
 First published in 1926 Published according to in Lenin Miscellany V the manuscript A LETTER TO Y. 
 D. 
 STASOVA AND TO THE OTHER COMRADES IN PRISON IN MOSCOW January 19, 1905 Dear Friends, I have received your inquiry concerning the tactics to be pursued in court (in Absolute’s29 letter and the note “reported verbatim” through an unknown person). 
 Absolute writesof two points of view. 
 The note speaks of three groups;perhaps it has in mind three shades of opinion, which I shall attempt to reconstruct as follows: (1) To refuse to recognise the court and to boycott it outright. 
 (2) To refuse to recognisethe court and not to participate in the court proceedings;to employ a lawyer only with the understanding that he speakexclusively about the court’s lack of jurisdiction from thepoint of view of abstract law; in the concluding speech for the defence to make a profession de foi * and to demand a trial by jury. 
 (3) The same applies to the defendant’s last statement. 
To use the trial as a means of agitation and, for this purpose,to take part in the court proceedings with the aid of legalcounsel; to show up the unlawfulness of the trial and evento call witnesses (to prove alibis, etc. 
). 
 There is this further question: should you say only that you are a Social-Democrat by conviction, or should you admitthat you are a member of the Russian Social-DemocraticLabour Party? You write that a pamphlet is needed on this question. 
 I do not think it is advisable to issue a pamphlet straight away *Declaration of faith, a programme, the exposition of a world outlook . 
— Ed. 
 without any experience to go by. 
 Perhaps we shall mention it somehow in the newspaper when the opportunity occurs. 
 Perhaps one of the people in prison will write a short article for the paper (from 5,000 to 8,000 letters)? I think this wouldbe the best way to start the discussion. 
 I personally have not yet formed a definite opinion and should prefer, before committing myself, to talk it over indetail with comrades who are in prison or have stood trial. 
 To get such a talk started I shall state my own ideas on the subject. 
 Much depends, I think, on the kind of trial it will be, viz. 
, whether or not there will be a possibility to utiliseit for purposes of agitation. 
 In the first instance, policy No. 
 1will not do; in the second, it is appropriate, but only afteran open, definite, and energetic protest and statement. 
 How-ever, if there is a chance of taking advantage of the trial for agitational purposes, policy No. 
 3 is desirable. 
 A speech witha profession de foi is generally most desirable, and, I think, very useful, and it could in most cases have an agitationaleffect. 
 Particularly when the government has begun to uti-lise the courts, the Social-Democrats should speak out about the Social-Democratic programme and tactics. 
 Some hold that it is not advisable to declare oneself a member of the Party,particularly of any definite organisation; that one shouldrather declare oneself a Social-Democrat by conviction andlimit the statement to that. 
 I think that one’s affiliationsshould be omitted entirely from the speech, i. 
e. 
, that one should say: For obvious reasons I shall not speak about my affiliations; but I am a Social-Democrat and I shall speak ofo u r Party. 
 Such a formulation has two advantages: it states directly and specifically that one is not to speak of one’saffiliations (viz. 
, whether one belongs to an organisation, andif so, to which, etc. 
), while at the same time one speaks of our Party. 
 This is necessary in order that Social-Democratic speeches in court may become Party speeches and statements,in order that the Party may benefit by this propaganda. 
In other words, I waive my formal affiliations; I pass themover in silence, I do not speak formally in the name of anyorganisation whatever, but as a Social-Democrat I speak to the court of our Party and ask it to accept my statements as an endeavour to expound precisely the Social-Democraticviews that have been set forth in all our Social-Democratic literature, in such-and-such pamphlets, leaflets, and newspa-pers. 
 As to lawyers. 
 Lawyers should be kept well in hand and made to toe the line, for there is no telling what dirty tricksthis intellectualist scum will be up to. 
 They should be warnedin advance: Look here, you confounded rascal, if you permityourself the slightest impropriety or political opportunism (if you speak of socialism as something immature or wrong-headed, or as an infatuation, or if you say that the Social-Democrats reject the use of force , speak of their teachings and their movement as peaceful, etc. 
, or anything of the sort),then I, the defendant, will pull you up publicly, right thenand there, call you a scoundrel, declare that I reject such adefence, etc. 
 And these threats must be carried out. 
 Only clever lawyers should be engaged; we do not need others. 
 They should be told beforehand: Confine yourselves to criticisingand “laying traps” for witnesses and the public prosecutor onthe facts of the case, and to nailing trumped-up charges;confine yourselves exclusively to discrediting the Shemya-kin-trial 30 features of the proceedings. 
 Even a smart liberal lawyer is extremely prone to mention or hint at the peaceful nature of the Social-Democratic movement, at the recognitionof its cultural influence even by people like Adolf Wagner,etc. 
 All such attempts should be nipped in the bud. 
 The law-yers, as Bebel, I believe, said, are the most reactionary ofpeople. 
 The cobbler should stick to his last. 
 Be a lawyer only, ridicule the witnesses for the State and the Public Prose-cutor; at most, draw a comparison between such a trial and atrial by jury in a free country; but leave the defendant’sconvictions alone, do not even dare to mention what youthink of his convictions and actions. 
 For you, a measly lib-eral, have so little understanding of these convictions that even in praising them you will not be able to avoid saying something banal. 
 Of course, all this need not be explained tothe lawyer à la Sobakevich 31; it can be done mildly, tactfully, discreetly. 
 Still, it is better to be wary of lawyers and notto trust them, especially if they say that they are Social-Demo-crats and Party members (as defined by our Clause 1!) The question of taking part in the court proceedings, it seems to me, depends on the question of the lawyer. 
Retaining counsel means participating in the court proceed-ings. 
 And why not participate in order to show up witnesses and agitate against the court? Of course, one must be very careful not to slip into a tone of unbecoming self-vindica-tion—that goes without saying. 
 It is best to declare immedi-ately, before the taking of testimony, in answering the presid-ing judge’s first questions: I am a Social-Democrat, and inmy speech to the court I shall explain what that means. 
 Ineach case, the question whether or not to take part in the court proceedings depends entirely upon the circumstances. 
 Let us assume that you have been proved guilty, that the wit-nesses are telling the truth, that the entire accusation restson unassailable documentary evidence. 
 In that case it may beof no use to take part in the court proceedings, and all atten-tion should be centred on the declaration of principles. 
 If, however, the facts are dubious, if the police witnesses are confused and lie, then it is hardly worth while to miss anopportunity of making propaganda by exposing the case asa frame-up. 
 Much depends also on the defendants; if they arevery tired, ill, or worn-out, and if there is no one among themwith experience in “pleading” and word-tilting, then, per-haps, it would be more expedient to refuse to participate in the court proceedings, to make a statement to that effect,and to concentrate on the declaration of principles, whichit is desirable to prepare in advance. 
 At any rate, the speechon the principles, the programme, and the tactics of theSocial-Democratic Party, on the working-class movement, on the socialist aims, and on uprising is the most important thing. 
 In conclusion, I repeat once more: These are my first reflections, which should not be regarded in the least as anattempt to solve the problem. 
 We must wait until experi-ence gives us certain hints. 
 And while accumulating this expe-rience the comrades, in the majority of cases, will have to be guided by a consideration of the concrete circumstances andby their revolutionary instinct . 
 My very best regards to Kurz, Ruben, Bauman, and all the other friends. 
 Cheer up! Things are going well with us now. 
 We are through with the trouble-makers at last. 
 Wehave done with the tactics of retreat. 
 We are attacking now. 
 The committees in Russia are also beginning to break with the disorganisers. 
 We have founded a newspaper of our own. 
 We have our own practical centre (the Bureau). 
 Two issues of the paper have appeared and shortly (January 23,1905, new style) the third will be coming out. 
 We hope topublish it as a weekly. 
 Best of health and good cheer! Weshall meet again, I am sure, and carry on the fight under bet-ter conditions than amid the squabbling and wrangling we have here, after the manner of the League congresses.

 7 (30) REVOLUTION IN RUSSIA Geneva, January 10 (23) The working class, which would seem to have stood aside for a long time from the bourgeois opposition movement, hasraised its voice. 
 With incredible speed the broad masses of the workers have caught up with their advanced comrades, the class-conscious Social-Democrats. 
 The workers’ move-ment in St. 
 Petersburg these days has made gigantic strides. 
Economic demands are giving way to political demands. 
 Thestrike is turning into a general strike and it has led to anunheard-of colossal demonstration; the prestige of the tsarist name has been ruined for good. 
 The uprising has begun. 
 Force against force. 
 Street fighting is raging, barricades arebeing thrown up, rifles are crackling, guns are roaring. 
 Riversof blood are flowing, the civil war for freedom is blazing up. 
Moscow and the South, the Caucasus and Poland are ready tojoin the proletariat of St. 
 Petersburg. 
 The slogan of the workers has become: Death or freedom! Today and tomorrow a great deal will be decided. 
 The sit-uation changes with every hour. 
 The telegraph brings breath-taking news, and all words now seem feeble in compari-son with the events we are living through. 
 Everyone must beready to do his duty as a revolutionary and as a Social-Democrat.

 3, Published according to January 24 (11), 1905 the text in Vperyod WORKING-CLASS AND BOURGEOIS DEMOCRACY The question of the attitude of the Social-Democrats, or working-class democrats, to the bourgeois democrats isan old and yet ever new question. 
 It is old because it hasbeen an issue ever since the inception of Social-Democracy. 
 Its theoretical principles were elucidated in the earliest Marxist literature, in the Communist Manifesto and in Capital . 
 It is ever new because every step in the develop-ment of every capitalist country produces a peculiar, orig-inal blending of different shades of bourgeois democracyand different trends within the socialist movement. 
 In Russia, too, this old question has become particu-larly new at the present time. 
 To make clear for ourselveshow this question should be presented today, we shallbegin with a brief excursion into history. 
 The old Russianrevolutionary Narodniks 32 held a utopian, semi-anarchist point of view. 
 They considered the peasants in the village communes ready-made socialists. 
 Behind the liberalism of the educated Russian society they clearly perceived theambitious desires of the Russian bourgeoisie. 
 They repudiatedthe struggle for political freedom on the grounds thatit was a struggle for institutions advantageous to the bour-geoisie. 
 The Narodnaya Volya members 33 made a step forward when they took up the political struggle, but they failed to connect it with socialism. 
 The clear socialistapproach to the question was even overshadowed whenthe waning faith in the socialist nature of our communesbegan to be renewed with theories in the spirit of V. 
 V. 
 34 about the non-class, non-bourgeois nature of the Russian democratic intelligentsia. 
 The result was that Narodism, which in the past had positively rejected bourgeois liber-alism, began gradually to merge with the latter in a single liberal-Narodist trend. 
 The bourgeois-democratic nature of the movement among the Russian intellectuals, beginning with the most moderate, the uplift movement, and ending with the most extreme, the revolutionary terrorist move-ment, became more and more obvious with the rise anddevelopment of a proletarian ideology (Social-Democracy)and a mass working-class movement. 
 But the growth ofthe latter was attended by a split among the Social-Demo-crats. 
 A revolutionary and an opportunist wing of Social-Democracy became clearly defined, the former representingthe proletarian tendencies in our movement, the latterthe tendencies of the intelligentsia. 
 Legal Marxism 35 soon proved in fact to be “the reflection of Marxism in bourgeoisliterature”, 36 and, via Bernsteinian opportunism,37 ended up in liberalism. 
 On the one hand, the Economists in theSocial-Democratic movement were carried away by thesemi-anarchist conception of a labour movement pure-and-simple; they regarded socialist support of the bourgeoisopposition as a betrayal of the class point of view anddeclared bourgeois democracy in Russia to be a phantom. 
 * On the other hand, the Economists of another shade, car-ried away by the selfsame idea of a labour movement pure-and-simple, accused the revolutionary Social-Democratsof ignoring the social struggle against the autocracy whichour liberals, Zemstvo men and uplifters wage. 
 ** The old Iskra pointed to elements of bourgeois democ-racy in Russia at a time when many did not yet perceivethem. 
 It demanded support for this democratic trend onthe part of the proletariat (see Iskra , No.

). 
 It constantly stressed the class, bourgeois nature of the liberal and radical movement and said of the vacillating Osvobozhdeniye people: “It is high time to under-stand the simple truth that it is not political chicanery, not what the late Stepnyak ** once called self-restric-tion and self-concealment, not the conventional lie ofdiplomatic mutual recognition that ensure a genuine (andnot merely verbal) joint struggle against the common enemy, but actual participation in the struggle, actual unity in struggle. 
 When the struggle of the German Social-Dem-ocrats against the military-police and feudal-clericalreaction really became one with the struggle of any genuineparty which relied for support upon a definite class of thepeople (for instance, the liberal bourgeoisie), then joint action was instituted without any phrase-mongering about mutual recognition” (No. 
 26). 
 *** This approach to the question on the part of the old Iskra brings us directly to the present differences over the attitude of the Social-Democrats towards the liberals. 
These disputes, as we know, began at the Second Congress, which adopted two resolutions representing the points of view of the majority (Plekhanov’s resolution) and of theminority (Starover’s resolution 38), respectively. 
 The first resolution accurately defines the class character of liberal-ism, as a movement of the bourgeoisie, and brings to thefore the task of explaining to the proletariat the anti-revolutionary and anti-proletarian essence of the main liberal trend (the Osvobozhdeniye movement). 
 While recog-nising the need for the proletariat’s support of bourgeoisdemocracy, this resolution does not resort to the politi-cians’ mutual recognition device, but, in the spirit of theold Iskra , makes it a question of concerted struggle. 
 “To *I take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation to Starover and Plekhanov, who undertook the very useful job of reveal-ing the authors of the unsigned articles in the old Iskra . 
 It is to be hoped that they will complete this work—the material will be highlyinteresting for an appraisal of the new Iskra ’s volte-face to the stand-point of Rabocheye Dyelo .

 the extent that the bourgeoisie is revolutionary or merely oppositional in its struggle against tsarism”, the Social-Democrats “must support” it. 
 Starover’s resolution, on the contrary, does not give a class analysis of liberalism and democracy. 
 It is fullof good intentions, it devises terms of agreement that arepossibly loftier and better, but unfortunately fictitious,just words : the liberals or the democrats must declare so-and-so, must not put forward such-and-such demands , must adopt such-and-such a slogan . 
 As if the history of bourgeois democracy anywhere and everywhere has notwarned the workers against putting their trust in decla-rations, demands, and slogans. 
 As if history has not affordedus hundreds of instances in which bourgeois democrats came forward with slogans demanding, not only full lib-erty, but also equality, with socialist slogans—withoutthereby ceasing to be bourgeois democrats—and thus“befogged” the minds of the proletariat all the more. 
 Theintellectualist wing of Social-Democracy wants to combatthis befogging by setting conditions to the bourgeois demo-crats that they abstain from befogging. 
 The proletarian wing, in its struggle, resorts to an analysis of the classcontent of democratism. 
 The intellectualist wing huntsout words for terms of an agreement. 
 The proletarian wingdemands actual co-operation in the struggle. 
 The intellec-tualist wing devises a criterion of a good and kind bour-geoisie, worthy of concluding agreements with. 
 The pro-letarian wing expects no kindness from the bourgeoisie,but supports any, even the very worst bourgeoisie, to the extent that it actually fights tsarism . 
 The intellectualist wing slips into a huckster’s standpoint: if you side withthe Social-Democrats and not with the Socialists-Revolu-tionaries, we shall agree upon a pact against the common enemy; otherwise we won’t. 
 The proletarian wing main-tains the point of view of expediency: the support we shalllend you will be exclusively conditioned on whether itwill put us in a better position to aim a blow—greater orlesser—at our enemy. 
 All the shortcomings of Starover’s resolution came to light upon its very first impact with reality. 
 The touch-stone was provided by the famous plan of the new Iskra ’s Editorial Board, the plan “of a higher type of mobilisa-tion”, bearing on the debated questions of principle in No. 
 77 (the editorial “Democracy at the Parting of the Ways”) and No. 
 78 (Starover’s feuilleton ). 
 The plan was dealt with in Lenin’s pamphlet, but the arguments willneed to be more closely discussed here. 
 The main idea (or rather the main confusion of ideas) of the new Iskra ’s arguments is the differentiation between the Zemstvo liberals and the bourgeois democrats. 
 This differentiation is the guiding thread that runs throughboth articles. 
 Incidentally, the attentive reader willobserve that in place of the term bourgeois democracy, paral-lel with it and synonymously, the following terminologyis used: democracy, radical intelligentsia ( sic!), nascent democracy, and intellectualist democracy. 
 This differ-entiation was hailed by the new Iskra with characteristic modesty as a great discovery, an original conception thatwas “beyond” poor Lenin. 
 The differentiation is linkeddirectly with the new method of struggle of which we haveheard so much both from Trotsky and directly from the Iskra editors, namely, that Zemstvo liberalism “is fit only to be chastised with scorpions”, while intellectualist democ-racy is suitable for agreements with us. 
 Democracy mustact independently, as an independent force. 
 “Russian lib-eralism, bereft of its historically essential part, its motivenerve [mark that!], its bourgeois-democratic half, is fit only to be chastised with scorpions. 
” In Lenin’s conception “of Russian liberalism there was no room for such socialelements on which the Social-Democrats, in their role ofvanguard of democracy, could at any time [!l exert theirinfluence”. 
 Such is the new theory. 
 Like all new theories of the pres-ent Iskra , it is a complete muddle. 
 In the first place, the claim to priority in the discovery of intellectualist democ-racy is unfounded and absurd. 
 Secondly, the differentiaion made between Zemstvo liberalism and bourgeois democ-racy is erroneous. 
 Thirdly, the conception that the intel-ligentsia can become an independent force does not hold water. 
 Fourthly, the assertion that Zemstvo liberalism (without its “bourgeois-democratic” half) is fit only to bechastised, etc. 
, is unjust. 
 Let us examine all these points. 
 Lenin is supposed to have ignored the birth of intellec-tualist democracy and the third element. 
 Let us open Zarya ,39 No. 
 2-3 *, and take the “Review of Home Affairs” which is quoted in Starover’s feuilleton. 
We read the heading of the third section , “The Third Ele-ment”. 
 Throughout this section we read about “the increasein the numbers and in the influence of such persons servingin the Zemstvos as doctors, technicians, and so on”; of “the unsubmissive economic development ... which gives rise to the need for intellectuals, who are becoming increas-ingly numerous”; of “the inevitability of conflicts betweenthese intellectuals and the bureaucrats and administra-tion bigwigs”; of “the outright epidemic character of theseconflicts lately”; of “the irreconcilability of autocracy with the interests of the intelligentsia generally”. 
 We read a direct appeal to these elements to rally “to the banner” of Social-Democracy.... 
 Quite a pretty account, wouldn’t one say? The newly discovered intellectualist democracy and the need for ral-lying it to the banner of Social-Democracy were “discovered” by that mischievous Lenin three years ago ! Of course, the antithesis between the Zemstvo men and the bourgeois democrats had not yet been discovered atthat time. 
 But contraposing the two would be just asrational as saying, “Moscow Gubernia ** and the territory of the Russian Empire”. 
 Both the Zemstvo people, who believe in qualified suffrage, and the Marshals of the Nobility are democrats , to the extent that they oppose autocracy and serfdom. 
 Their democratism is limited, narrow, andinconsistent, just as any and all bourgeois democratism isin one or another degree limited, narrow and inconsistent. 
The editorial in Iskra , No. 
 77, analyses our liberals by dividing them into the following groups: (1) serf-owning landlords; (2) liberal landlords; (3) the liberal intelligentsia, *See present edition, Vol. 
 5, pp. 
 281-89. 
— Ed. 
 **Gubernia , uyezd , volost —Russian administrative-territorial units. 
 The largest of these was the gubernia, which had its subdivisionsin uyezds, which in turn were subdivided into volosts. 
 This system of districting continued under the Soviet power until the introduction of the new system of administrative-territorial division of the countryin 1929-30. 
— Ed. 
 which stands for a constitution with qualified suffrage; and (4) the extreme Left—the democratic intelligentsia. 
 This analysis is incomplete and muddled, since the division of the intelligentsia is confounded with those of variousclasses and groups whose interests are expressed by theintelligentsia. 
 Besides the interests of a broad section ofthe landlords, Russian bourgeois democratism reflectsthe interests of the mass of tradesmen and manufacturers, chiefly medium and small, as well as (and this is particu-larly important) those of the mass of proprietors and pettyproprietors among the peasantry. 
 The first flaw in Iskra ’s analysis is its ignoring of this broadest section of Russia’sbourgeois-democratic sphere. 
 The second flaw is its failureto see that the Russian democratic intelligentsia breaks up necessarily, not by accident, into three main trends corresponding to their political stand: the Osvobozhdeniye , the Socialist-Revolutionary, and the Social-Democratic. 
All these trends have a long history, and each expresses(as definitely as is possible in an autocratic state) the pointof view of the moderate and the revolutionary ideologists of the bourgeois democrats and the point of view of the proletariat. 
 Nothing could be more amusing than the inno-cent wish of the new Iskra that “the democrats should act as an independent force”, while at the same time the demo-crats are identified with the radical intelligentsia! Thenew Iskra has forgotten that the radical intelligentsia or intellectual democratic movement, which has become “an independent force”, is none other than our “ Socialist-Revolutionary Party ”! Our democratic intelligentsia could have no other “extreme Left”. 
 It stands to reason, however,that one can speak of the independent force of such an in-telligentsia only in the ironical or terrorist sense of the word. 
 To stand on the same platform with the bourgeois democrats and move Leftward away from the Osvobozh-deniye means to move towards the Socialists-Revolution-aries, and in no other direction. 
 Finally, still less does the latest discovery of the new Iskra stand up to criticism, namely, the discovery that “liberalism without its bourgeois-democratic half” is fit only to be chastised with scorpions, that “it is wiser to scrapthe idea of hegemony” if there is no one to turn to except the Zemstvo people. 
 Liberalism, of whatever kind, merits support by the Social-Democrats only to the extent that it actually opposes the autocracy. 
 It is this support of all the inconsistent (i. 
e. 
, bourgeois) democrats by the onlyreally consistent democrat (i. 
e. 
, the proletariat) that makesthe idea of hegemony a reality. 
 Only a petty-bourgeoishuckster’s idea of hegemony can conceive it as a compro-mise, mutual recognition, a matter of worded terms. 
 From the proletarian point of view hegemony in a war goes to him who fights most energetically, who never misses achance to strike a blow at the enemy, who always suitsthe action to the word, who is therefore the ideologicalleader of the democratic forces, who criticises half-waypolicies of every kind. 
 * The new Iskra is sadly mistaken if it thinks that half-heartedness is a moral and not a politico-economic attribute of bourgeois democracy, if it thinks itpossible and necessary to fix such a degree of half-heart-edness up to which liberalism deserves only the scorpion’s lash and beyond which it deserves agreements. 
 This simply means “determining in advance the permissible degree of baseness”. 
 Indeed, ponder the meaning of these words: to make it the term of an agreement with the oppositiongroups that they recognise universal, equal, and directsuffrage by secret ballot means “to present them with theinfallible reagent of our demands, the litmus-paper testof democracy, and to place the whole weight of the prole-tariat’s valuable support on the scale of their political plans” (No. 
 78). 
 How prettily this is put! And how onefeels like saying to the author of these fine words, Staro-ver: My dear friend, Arkady Nikolayevich, your fine wordsare wasted! Mr. 
 Struve rendered Starover’s infallible reagentineffectual with a single stroke of the pen when he wrote universal suffrage into the programme of the Osvobozhde-niye League. 
 And the same Struve has proved to us in deeds on more than one occasion that all these programmes are *A note for a shrewd new-Iskrist. 
 We shall probably be told that the energetic struggle of the proletariat without any terms will result in the theft of the fruits of victory by the bourgeoisie. 
 Our reply to thisis the question: what possible guarantee can there be for the fulfilmentof the proletariat’s terms other than the independent force of theproletariat? mere scraps of paper as far as the liberals are concerned, not litmus-paper, but ordinary paper, since a bourgeois democrat thinks nothing of writing one thing today and another tomorrow. 
 This is characteristic even of manybourgeois intellectuals who go over to the Social-Demo-crats. 
 The entire history of European and Russian liberal-ism provides hundreds of instances wherein word and deedare at variance, which is why Starover’s desire to think up infallible paper reagents is so naïve. 
 This naïve desire leads Starover to the great idea that supporting the anti-tsarist struggle of bourgeois who donot agree to universal suffrage means “bringing to noughtthe idea of universal suffrage”! Perhaps Starover will writeus another pretty * feuilleton to prove that by supporting the monarchists in their struggle against the autocracy we are reducing to nought the “idea” of a republic? The trou-ble is that Starover’s thoughts revolve helplessly in avicious circle of terms, slogans, demands, and declarations,and overlook the only real criterion—the degree of actualparticipation in the struggle. 
 In practice, this inevitably results in varnishing the radical intelligentsia with whom an “agreement” is declared to be possible. 
 With disdainfor Marxism, the intelligentsia is declared to be the“motive nerve” (not the glib servant?) of liberalism. 
 The Frenchand Italian radicals are honoured with the designation ofpeople to whom anti-democratic or anti-proletarian demands are alien, although everyone knows that these rad-icals have betrayed their platforms and misled the prole-*Another specimen of our Arkady Nikolayevich’s prose: “Anyone who has been following public life in Russia during the last few yearscould not have failed to note the growing democratic urge towards anuntouched-up concept of constitutional liberty stripped of all ideo-logical trappings, of all survivals of the historical past. 
 This urge was, in a way, the realisation of a long process of molecular changes withinthe democratic trend, of its Ovidian metamorphoses, whose kaleidos-copic variety has held the attention and interest of several successivegenerations over a period of two decades. 
” A pity, indeed, that this isnot true; for the idea of liberty is not stripped but, on the contrary, touched up with the idealism of the latest philosophers of bourgeois democracy (Bulgakov, Berdayev, Novgorodtsev, and others. 
 See “Prob-lems of Idealism” and The Ne w Wa y ). 
 A pity, too, that all these kalei-doscopic Ovidian metamorphoses of Starover, Trotsky, and Martovreveal an unadulterated urge for florid phrases. 
 tariat times out of number, although on the very next page (p. 
 7) of the same issue of Iskra (No. 
 78) you may read that the monarchists and the republicans in Italy were “at one in the fight against socialism”. 
 The resolution of theSaratov intellectuals (the Sanitary Service Society), press-ing for participation of representatives of all the peoplein legislative activities, is declared to be “the real voice[!] of democracy” (No. 
 77). 
 The practical plan for prole-tarian participation in the Zemstvo campaign is accom-panied by the advice “to enter into some agreement withthe representatives of the Left Wing of the oppositionalbourgeoisie” (the famous agreement not to create panicfear). 
 In answer to Lenin’s question, what had happenedto Starover’s notorious terms of agreement, the Editorial Board of the new Iskra wrote: “These terms should always be present in the minds of Party mem-bers, and the latter, knowing on what conditions the Party consents toenter into formal political agreements with a democratic party, aremorally bound, even in the case of local agreements referred to in theletter, to differentiate strictly between the reliable representatives of the bourgeois opposition—the real democrats, and the liberal milk-skimmers. 
” * Step leads to step. 
 In addition to Party agreements (the only permissible ones, according to Starover’s resolution),local agreements have appeared in various cities. 
 Side byside with formal agreements, moral ones have appeared. 
 It now seems that verbal recognition of “terms” and their “moral” binding force carries with it the title of a “reliable”and “real democrat”, although every child understands that hundreds of Zemstvo windbags would make any verbal statements and even give the word of honour of a radicalthat they are socialists—anything to keep the Social-Democrats quiet. 
 *See the second editorial, “A Letter to the Party Organisations”, likewise published secretly (“for members of the Party only”), although there is nothing secret about it. 
 It is very instructive to compare thisreply of the whole Editorial Board with Plekhanov’s “secret” pam-phlet, On Our Tactics Towards the Struggle of the Liberal Bourgeoisie Against Tsarism (Geneva, 1905. 
 A letter to the Central Committee. 
 For Party members only). 
 We hope to return to both these works. 
 No, the proletariat will not be drawn into this game of slogans, declarations, and agreements. 
 The proletariat will never forget that bourgeois democrats never make reliable democrats. 
 The proletariat will support the bour-geois democrats, not on the basis of deals to abstain fromcreating panic fear, not on the basis of belief in theirreliability, but when and to the extent that they actuallystruggle against the autocracy. 
 Such support is necessary in the interests of achieving the independent social-rev-olutionary aims of the proletariat. 
 Vperyod , No. 
 3, Published according to January 24 (11), 1905 the text in Vperyod NARODISM TO ISM A R T I C L E O N E A legal newspaper recently expressed the opinion that this is no time to dwell on the “antagonism” of interests among the different classes opposing the autocracy. 
 This opinion is not new. 
 We have come across it, of course, withreservations of one sort or other, in the columns of Osvo-bozhdeniye and Revolutsionnaya Rossiya . 
 It is natural that such a point of view should prevail among the representa-tives of the bourgeois democrats. 
 As far as the Social-Democrats are concerned, there can be no two opinions among them on this question. 
 The combined struggle ofthe proletariat and the bourgeoisie against the autocracymust not and cannot make the proletariat forget the anta-gonism of interests between it and the propertied classes. 
To get a clear idea of this antagonism it is necessary to have a clear idea of the profound differences that exist between the points of view of the different trends. 
 This does notimply, of course, that we should reject temporary agree-ments with the adherents of other trends, both with theSocialists-Revolutionaries and the liberals, such as theSecond Congress of our Party declared permissible for Social-Democrats. 
 The Social-Democrats consider the Socialists-Revolu-tionaries to be the representatives of the extreme Leftgroup of our bourgeois democracy. 
 The Socialists-Revo-lutionaries resent this opinion of them and regard it as amean attempt to humiliate an opponent and to question his sincerity and good faith. 
 Actually, such an opinion has nothing whatever to do with suspicion; it is merelya Marxist definition of the class origin and the class nature of the views of the Socialists-Revolutionaries. 
 The more clearly and definitely the Socialists-Revolutionaries state their views, the more they confirm the Marxist character-isation of them. 
 Of great interest in this respect is thedraft programme of the Party of the Socialists-Revolu-tionaries published in Revolutsionnaya Rossiya , No. 
 46. 
 This draft is a considerable step forward, not only in relation to clarity of exposition of principles. 
 The progress is to be noted in the content of the principles them-selves, the progress from Narodism to Marxism, fromdemocracy to socialism. 
 Our criticism of the Socialists-Rev-olutionaries has obviously borne fruit; it has compelledthem to lay particular stress on their socialist good inten-tions and the views which they hold in common with Marx-ism. 
 All the more glaring, on the other hand, are the features of their old, Narodnik, vaguely democraticviews. 
 We would remind those who are prone to accuse usof being contradictory (recognising the socialist goodintentions of the Socialists-Revolutionaries, while definingtheir social nature as bourgeois-democratic) that examples of socialism, not only of the petty-bourgeois but of the bourgeois variety, were long ago analysed in the Communist Manifesto . 
 The good intentions of being a socialist do not rule out a bourgeois-democratic essence. 
 A study of the draft reveals three main features of the Socialist-Revolutionary world outlook. 
 First, theoretical emendations of Marxism. 
 Second, the survivals of Naro-dism in their views of the labouring peasantry and theagrarian question. 
 Third, the same Narodnik survivalsin their view of the impending Russian revolution asnon-bourgeois in character. 
 I said emendations of Marxism. 
 Precisely. 
 The whole main trend of thought, the whole framework of the pro-gramme, points to the victory of Marxism over Narodism. 
The latter is still alive (kept so with the aid of injectionsof revisionism of the latest style), but only as partial “cor-rections” of Marxism. 
 Let us take the main general theoret-ical emendation, the theory of the favourable and unfavourable relation between the positive and negative sides of capitalism. 
 This emendation, insofar as it is notcompletely muddled, introduces the old Russian subjectiv-ism into Marxism. 
 The recognition of the “creative” his-torical activity of capitalism, which socialises labour and creates “a social force” capable of transforming society, the force of the proletariat, denotes a break withNarodism and a transition to Marxism. 
 The theory ofsocialism is founded on the objective development of eco-nomic forces and of class division. 
 The emendation: “Insome branches of industry, especially agriculture, and in entire countries” the relation between the positive and negative sides of capitalism “is becoming [how far they have gone!]less and less favourable”. 
 This is a repetition of Hertzand David, of Nik. 
—on, 40 and of V. 
 V. 
 with his theory of the special “destinies of capitalism in Russia”. 
 The back-wardness of Russia in general and of Russian agriculture in particular is no longer regarded as the backwardness of capitalism , but as a uniqueness justifying backward theo-ries. 
 Alongside the materialist conception of history weget the time-worn view according to which the intelligent-sia is capable of choosing more or less favourable pathsfor the country and of becoming the supraclass judge of capitalism, not the mouthpiece of the class that is begotten by capitalism’s destruction of the old forms of life. 
 Thefact that capitalist exploitation in Russia takes on partic-ularly repellent forms because of the survival of pre-cap-italist relations is overlooked in typical Narodnikfashion. 
 The Narodnik theory stands revealed still more clearly in the notions on the peasantry. 
 Throughout the draft thefollowing words and phrases are used without discrim-ination: the toilers, the exploited, the working class,the labouring masses, the class of the exploited, the exploitedclasses. 
 If the authors stopped to think over the last term (“classes”), which escaped them unguardedly, they would realise that it is the petty bourgeois as well as theproletarians who work and are exploited under capitalism. 
What has been said of the legal Narodniks can be said ofour Socialists-Revolutionaries: to them goes the honourof discovering an unheard-of type of capitalism without a petty bourgeoisie. 
 They speak of the labouring peasantry, but shut their eyes to a fact which has been proved, stud-ied, weighed, described, and pondered, namely, that the peasant bourgeoisie now definitely predominates among our labouring peasantry, and that the well-to-do peasantry, although entitled to the designation labouring peasantry, cannot get along without hiring farm-hands and alreadycontrols the better half of the peasantry’s productive forces. 
 Very odd, indeed, from this point of view, is the goal which the Party of the Socialists-Revolutionaries has setitself in its minimum programme: “In the interests of socialism and of the struggle against bourgeois-proprietary principles, to make use of the views, traditions, and modesof life of the Russian peasantry, both as toilers in generaland as members of the village communes, particularly itsconception of the land as being the common property ofall the toiling people. 
” This objective seems, at first blush, to be a quite harmless, purely academic repetition of the village-commune utopias long since refuted both by theoryand life. 
 In reality, however, we are dealing with a pressingpolitical issue which the Russian revolution promisesto solve in the very near future: Who will take advantageof whom? Will the revolutionary intelligentsia, which believes itself to be socialist, utilise the toiler conceptions of the peasantry in the interests of the struggle againstbourgeois-proprietary principles? Or will the bourgeois-proprietary and at the same time toiling peasantry utilisethe socialist phraseology of the revolutionary-democraticintelligentsia in the interests of the struggle against socialism? We are of the view that the second perspective will be realised (despite the will and the consciousness of ouropponents). 
 We are convinced that it will be realised becauseit has already nine-tenths been realised. 
 The “bourgeois-proprietary” (and at the same time labouring) peasantry has already made good use of the socialist phrases of the Narodnik, democratic intelligentsia, which harboured illusionsof sustaining “the toiler traditions and modes of life” bymeans of its artels, co-operatives, fodder grass cultivation,ploughs, Zemstvo warehouses, and banks, but which actu-ally promoted the development of capitalism within the village commune. 
 Russian economic history has thus proved what Russian political history will prove tomor-row. 
 The class-conscious proletariat has the duty to explain to the rural proletarian, without in any way withholding support of the progressive and revolutionary aspirations of the bourgeois labouring peasantry, that a struggle against that peasantry is inevitable in the future;it has the duty to explain to him the real aims of social-ism, as opposed to the bourgeois-democratic fancies of equal-ised land tenure. 
 With the bourgeois peasantry, againstthe survivals of serfdom, against the autocracy, the priests, and the landlords; with the urban proletariat against the bourgeoisie in general and against the bourgeois peasantryin particular—this is the only correct slogan for the ruralproletarian, this is the only correct agrarian programmefor Russian Social-Democracy at the present moment. 
It was this programme that our Second Congress adopted. 
 With the peasant bourgeoisie for democracy, with the urban proletariat for socialism—this slogan will have afar stronger appeal to the rural poor than the showy butempty slogans of the Socialist-Revolutionary dabblers inNarodism. 
 We come now to the third of the above-mentioned main points of the draft. 
 Its authors have by now broken with the view of the consistent Narodniks, who were opposedto political freedom on the grounds that it could only resultin turning over power to the bourgeoisie. 
 But the survivalsof Narodism stand out very clearly in the part of the draftwhich characterises the autocracy and the attitude of the various classes towards it. 
 Here too, as always, we see that the very first attempts of the petty-bourgeois revolution-ary intelligentsia to clarify its conception of reality lead inevitably to the complete exposure of its contradictory andsuperannuated views. 
 (Let us, therefore, remark, paren-thetically, that disputes with the Socialists-Revolutiona-ries should always be reduced to this very question of their conception of reality, since this question alone clearlyreveals the causes of our deep-seated political divergence. 
) “The class of big manufacturers and tradesmen, who are more reactionary than anywhere else,” we read in thedraft, “stands more and more in need of the protection of the autocracy against the proletariat”.... 
 This is false; for nowhere in Europe is the indifference of the advanced bour-geoisie towards the autocratic form of rule so evident as in our country. 
 Discontent with the autocratic regime is growing among the bourgeoisie, regardless of its fear of the proletariat, in part simply because the police, for all its unlimited powers, cannot crush the working-class move-ment. 
 In speaking of “a class” of big manufacturers, the draft confounds the subdivisions and groups within thebourgeoisie with the entire bourgeoisie as a class. 
 Theincorrectness is all the more patent in that it is precisely the middle and petty bourgeoisie that the autocracy is least of all capable of satisfying. 
 “... The landed nobility and the village kulaks stand more and more in need of such support against the labouringmasses in the villages.... 
” Indeed? Where, then, does Zem-stvo liberalism come from? Whence the attraction for the enterprising muzhik on the part of the uplift (demo-cratic) intelligentsia and vice versa? Or does the kulak havenothing in common with the enterprising muzhik? “... An irreconcilable and growing antagonism is arising between the existence of autocracy and the whole economic,social-political and cultural development of the country.... 
” In this they have reduced their own premises ad absur-dum . 
 Is it possible to conceive of an “irreconcilable antago-nism” with the entire economic, as well as other, growthof the country that would not be reflected in the mood ofthe classes in economic command? It is one or the other:Either the autocracy is really incompatible with the eco-nomic development of the country; in that case it is incom-patible also with the interests of the entire class of manu-facturers, tradespeople, landlords, and enterprisingmuzhiks. 
 That this class has been controlling “our” economicdevelopment since 1861 41 is probably not unknown even to the Socialists-Revolutionaries (although they were taught the contrary by V. 
 V. 
). 
 That a government incom-patible with the bourgeois class in general can make cap-ital out of the conflicts between the groups and strata ofthe bourgeoisie, that it can make peace with the protection-ists against the free traders, enlist the support of onestratum against another, and keep up these equilibristics for years and decades, is borne out by the whole trend of European history. 
 Or, in our country the manufacturers, the landlords, and the peasant bourgeoisie “stand more and more in need” of the autocracy. 
 In that case we should have to accept the notion that they, the economic lords of the country, even taken as a whole, as a class, do not understand the interests of the country’s economic develop-ment, that not even the advanced, educated and intelli-gent representatives and leaders of these classes understandthese interests! But would it not be simpler to accept the idea that it is our Socialists-Revolutionaries who do not understand the situation? We need but see: a little further on, theythemselves admit “the existence of a liberal-democraticopposition, which embraces chiefly (in point of class) theintermediate elements of the educated society”. 
 But isour educated society not a bourgeois society? Is it not bound by a thousand ties to the tradesmen, manufacturers, land-lords, and enterprising muzhiks? Can God have possiblyordained for Russia a capitalism in which the liberal-democratic opposition is not a bourgeois-democratic oppo-sition? Do the Socialists-Revolutionaries know of any pre-cedent in history or can they conceive of any case in which the opposition of the bourgeoisie to the autocratic regime was not or would not be expressed through the liberal, educated “society”? The muddle in the draft is the inevitable outcome of confounding Narodism with Marxism. 
 Only Marxism hasgiven a scientifically correct analysis, confirmed more and more by reality, of the relation between the struggle for democracy and the struggle for socialism. 
 We, like therest of the world, have bourgeois democratism and working-class democratism. 
 With us, as with the rest of the world,the Social-Democrats must expose mercilessly the inevi-table illusions of the bourgeois democrats and their igno-rance of their own nature. 
 With us, as with the rest of the world, the class-conscious proletariat must support thebourgeois democrats in their opposition to the survivalsof serfdom and their struggle against them, against the autoc-racy, without forgetting for an instant that it is a classby itself, and that it has as its class aim the overthrow of the bourgeoisie. 
 Vperyod , No. 
 3, Published according to January 24 (11), 1905 the text in Vperyod THE ST. 
 PETERSBURG STRIKE The strike that began at the Putilov Works on January 3 is developing into one of the most imposing manifestationsof the working-class movement. 
 Our information so far is limited to reports in the foreign newspapers and the legal Russian press. 
 But even these sources leave no doubtthat the strike has already become a political event oftremendous importance. 
 The strike started quite spontaneously. 
 It was one of the clashes between labour and capital that are ever recurring. 
 This time the impetus was the dismissal of four workers by the factory management. 
 The workers rose ina high spirit of solidarity and demanded their reinstate-ment. 
 The movement gained rapidly. 
 The legally function-ing Russian Factory and Mill Workers’ Society is takingpart in it, and the strike is entering its next and higher phase. 
 This legal workers’ society has been an object of spe-cial attention on the part of the Zubatovists. 
 42 And now the Zubatov movement is outgrowing its bounds. 
 Initiatedby the police in the interests of the police, in the interestsof supporting the autocracy and demoralising the political consciousness of the workers, this movement is turning against the autocracy and is becoming an outbreak of theproletarian class struggle. 
 The Social-Democrats long ago predicted that such would be the inevitable outcome of the Zubatov movement inour country. 
 The legalisation of the working-class move-ment, they said, would definitely benefit us Social-Demo-crats. 
 It would draw certain sections of the workers intothe movement, especially the backward sections; it would help to rouse those who would not soon, perhaps ever, be roused by a socialist agitator. 
 And once drawn into the movement and having acquired an interest in their own future, the workers would go further. 
 The legal labourmovement would only be a new and broader basis for theSocial-Democratic labour movement. 
 * Without a doubt, this is precisely what happened in St. 
 Petersburg. 
 The movement owes its rapid expansion to two circum-stances: first, the moment was propitious for an economicstruggle (the government was in pressing need of the ful-filment of the orders placed by the War Ministry and theAdmiralty); secondly, the constitutional movement amongthe social strata was expanding. 
 Having begun the strike in defence of some dismissed comrades, the workers took the further step of presenting broad economic demands. 
They demanded an eight-hour day, a minimum wage (oneruble for men and seventy kopeks for women), the aboli-tion of compulsory overtime work (and double pay forovertime), improvement of sanitary conditions and medi-cal aid, etc. 
 The strike began to develop into a general strike. 
 The foreign papers report under date of Saturday, Jan-uary 8 (21, new style), that even according to officialRussian information 174 mills, factories, and workshopsinvolving 96,000 workers are on strike. 
 We are witnessing one of the great clashes between the developing proletarian class and its enemies, clashes thatwill leave their mark for many years to come. 
 But things did not stop at economic demands. 
 The move-ment has begun to assume a political character. 
 Thelocal Social-Democrats have attempted (although, it seems, still very feebly) to participate in it. 
 At huge mass meet-ings of the workers attended by several thousand peoplepolitical demands have come to be discussed and resolu-tions in favour of political freedom have been put to thevote. 
 The petition drawn up by the workers, it is reported,comprises three parts. 
 43 The first sets forth demands of *Cf. 
 N. 
 Lenin, What Is To Be Done? , pp. 
 86-88. 
 (See present edi-tion, Vol. 
 5, pp. 
 454-56. 
— Ed. 
) rights for the people; the second, measures to relieve the people’s poverty; the third, measures against the oppres-sion of labour by capital. 
 The first part contains the follow-ing demands: inviolability of the person; freedom ofspeech, assembly, and conscience; compulsory schoolingat the expense of the state; participation of elected repre-sentatives of the people in the legislature; equality of allbefore the law; a responsible Cabinet; abolition of the redemption payments 44; cheap credit; gradual sharing out of the state lands among the people; an income-tax. 
 (Ifthis report is true, it points to an extremely interestinginterpretation of the Social-Democratic programme inthe minds of the masses or their not very class-consciousleaders. 
) The correspondent of The Standard , an English newspaper, reports that three meetings took place on Jan-uary 5 (18) (of which one was attended by 4,000 andanother by 2,000) and that the following political demandswere endorsed: (1) the immediate convocation of a Constit-uent Assembly elected by a general vote; (2) an end to thewar; (3) full amnesty for political exiles and prisoners; (4) freedom of the press and of conscience; (5) freedom of assembly and the right of association. 
 The foreign pressfor January 8 (21) reports that preparations are under wayfor a demonstration to be held on Sunday, January 9 (22),outside the Winter Palace, at which a petition is to be pre-sented “to the tsar himself”. 
 Freedom or death, declare the workers. 
 Moscow and Libau are sending workers’ delegates to St. 
 Petersburg. 
 Such is the limited and still unconfirmed information to have reached us to date. 
 Obviously the movement hasnot yet attained its zenith by far, and we must await fur-ther events before we can form a definite opinion of what is occurring. 
 One is struck by the amazingly rapid shift of the movement from the purely economic to the politicalground, by the tremendous solidarity and energy displayedby hundreds of thousands of proletarians—and all this,notwithstanding the fact that conscious Social-Democraticinfluence is lacking or is but slightly evident. 
 The primi-tive character of the socialist views held by some of the leaders of the movement and the tenacity with which someelements of the working class cling to their naïve faith in the tsar enhance rather than lessen the significance of the revolutionary instinct now asserting itself among the prole-tariat. 
 The political protest of the leading oppressed class and its revolutionary energy break through all obstacles,both external, in the form of police bans, and internal, inthe form of the ideological immaturity and backwardnessof some of the leaders. 
 The work of the Social-Democratsduring the last ten years and the lessons of the working-class movement during this period have borne fruit; the ideas of socialism and of the political struggle are streamingthrough the broadest channels. 
 The proletariat is provingin action that on the political scene in Russia there arenot only two forces (autocracy and bourgeois society),as some in their faintness of heart have been ready to believe. 
 It is showing us manifestly superior forms of mobili-sation of the revolutionary class forces; this mobilisation,of course, is not to be classed with demonstrations of minorimportance in this or that municipal council, but withmass movements, like the Rostov demonstration and thestrikes of 1903 in the South. 
 The mobilisation of the revo-lutionary forces of the proletariat in this new and higher form is bringing us with gigantic strides nearer to themoment when the proletariat will even more decisivelyand more consciously join battle with the autocracy.

 83 of Iskra , which we have just received, contains a declaration by the Mensheviks and the Central Committee concerning “the complete cessation of the Minority’s organisational separateness”. 
 “The Minority,” we are assured, “ceases to consider itself a camp , and there can be no fur-ther question of either boycotting the Central Committeeor presenting ultimatums to it. 
” This statement comes just a wee bit late! The Party now knows from Lenin’spamphlet ( Statement and Documents on the Break of the Central Institutions with the Party *) that the “ultimatums” to co-opt Popov, Fisher, and Fomin have already been enforced , to be sure, on the quiet, by deception of the Party . 
 The ultimatum to sabotage the Third Congress throughsimilar deceptions has also been enforced. 
 The disorganisa-tion of local work is continuing, and the so-called Central Committee has approved the setting-up in St. 
 Petersburg (by the report in Iskra ) of “ a special organisation ” or group, “in view of the fact that its numerous [?] members areobviously unable to work under the leadership of the localcommittee”. 
 And so, what the “Majority” said and predicted, begin-ning with Lenin’s “Letter” (“Why I Resigned from the Iskra Editorial Board”, December 1903 **) and ending with Orlovsky’s pamphlet The Council Against the Party , has now been wholly and unquestionably confirmed by events. 
 The actual object of the eighteen months’ struggle wasthe co-optation of four to the Central Organ and three to * **See present edition, Vol.

 the Central Committee. 
 For the sake of co-optation the organisation-as-process theory and a heap of differences “on points of principle” were concocted. 
 For the sake of this co-optation our centres have now broken completely withthe Party and are breaking with the local committeespiecemeal. 
 The correctness of our slogan that “the Major-ity must break off all relations with the disorganisers”(Vperyod , No. 
 1, “Time to Call a Halt!” *) is now fully confirmed. 
 Extremely interesting, too, is the following passage from the Iskra statement: “The decision of the delegates [of the Minority] was submitted for discussion to all theadherents of the Minority working in the Kiev, Kharkov,Don, Kuban, St. 
 Petersburg, and Odessa committees, the Donets and Crimean leagues, and other Party organi-sations. 
” Thus, after a furious campaign of nearly eight-een months , the circle abroad, with the aid of the Central Organ, the Council, and (since May) the Central Committee,won to its side only five Russian committees out of the twenty attending the Second Congress ! ** Outside the committees, sizable groups considered worthy of being listed in Iskra were set up in only two cities, in St. 
 Petersburg and in Odessa. 
The Kuban Committee, apparently, was only recentlyknocked together for the sake of an extra pair of votes. 
 Consequently, Iskra , the organ of the Minority, now, in January, confirms the correctness of the analysis of the Party situation which another Menshevik gave in Septem-ber. 
 It was the agent of the Central Committee, sympa-thising with the Minority and now co-opted to the C.

 **Of the committees attending the Congress only the Kiev Com-mittee went over from the Majority to the Minority, i.

 In the Nikolayev and Siberian committees, on the contrary, both delegates to the Congress were Mensheviks, butafter the Congress these committees sided with the Majority. 
 The Odessa, Don, Ufa, and Moscow committees were divided at the Con-gress between the Majority and the Minority (one delegate in each). 
 Of these only the Don Committee is now Menshevist.

 It was this powerlessness of the circle abroad that made it engineer the Bonapartist coup in the C.

 and sidetrack, by deceit, the Third Congress.

 3, Published according to January 24 (11), 1905 the text in Vperyod /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR THE BEGINNING OF THE REVOLUTION IN RUSSIA Geneva, Wednesday, January 25 (12) Events of the greatest historical importance are devel-oping in Russia. 
 The proletariat has risen against tsarism. 
The proletariat was driven to revolt by the government. 
There can hardly be any doubt now that the governmentdeliberately allowed the strike movement to develop anda wide demonstration to be started more or less without hindrance in order to bring matters to a point where mili-tary force could be used. 
 Its manoeuvre was successful. 
Thousands of killed and wounded—such is the toll of BloodySunday, January 9, in St. 
 Petersburg. 
 The army defeatedunarmed workers, women, and children. 
 The army van-quished the enemy by shooting prostrate workers. 
 “We have taught them a good lesson!” the tsar’s henchmen and their European flunkeys from among the conservative bour-geoisie say with consummate cynicism. 
 Yes, it was a great lesson, one which the Russian pro-letariat will not forget. 
 The most uneducated, backwardsections of the working class, who naïvely trusted the tsar and sincerely wished to put peacefully before “the tsar himself” the petition of a tormented people, were all taughta lesson by the troops led by the tsar or his uncle, the GrandDuke Vladimir. 
 The working class has received a momentous lesson in civil war; the revolutionary education of the proletariat made more progress in one day than it could have made in months and years of drab, humdrum, wretched existence. 
The slogan of the heroic St. 
 Petersburg proletariat, “Deathor freedom!” is reverberating throughout Russia. 
 Events are developing with astonishing rapidity. 
 The general strike in St. 
 Petersburg is spreading. 
 All industrial, public, and political activities are paralysed. 
 On Monday, Janu-ary 10, still more violent clashes occurred between theworkers and the military. 
 Contrary to the mendaciousgovernment reports, blood is flowing in many parts ofthe capital. 
 The workers of Kolpino are rising. 
 The prole-tariat is arming itself and the people. 
 The workers are said to have seized the Sestroretsk Arsenal. 
 They are providing themselves with revolvers, forging their tools into weapons,and procuring bombs for a desperate bid for freedom. 
 Thegeneral strike is spreading to the provinces. 
 Ten thousandhave already ceased work in Moscow, and a general strikehas been called there for tomorrow (Thursday, January 13). 
 An uprising has broken out in Riga. 
 The workers are dem-onstrating in Lodz, an uprising is being prepared in War-saw, proletarian demonstrations are taking place in Hel-singfors. 
 Unrest is growing among the workers and thestrike is spreading in Baku, Odessa, Kiev, Kharkov, Kovno,and Vilna. 
 In Sevastopol, the naval stores and arsenals are ablaze, and the troops refuse to shoot at the mutineers. 
 Strikes in Revel and in Saratov. 
 Workers and reservistsclash with the troops in Radom. 
 The revolution is spreading. 
 The government is beginning to lose its head. 
 From the policy of bloody repression itis attempting to change over to economic concessions and to save itself by throwing a sop to the workers or promising the nine-hour day. 
 But the lesson of Bloody Sunday cannotbe forgotten. 
 The demand of the insurgent St. 
 Petersburgworkers—the immediate convocation of a Constituent As-sembly on the basis of universal, direct, and equal suffrageby secret ballot—must become the demand of all the strik-ing workers. 
 Immediate overthrow of the government— this was the slogan with which even the St. 
 Petersburgworkers who had believed in the tsar answered the massacreof January 9; they answered through their leader, the priestGeorgi Gapon, who declared after that bloody day: “Weno longer have a tsar. 
 A river of blood divides the tsar from the people. 
 Long live the fight for freedom!” Long live the revolutionary proletariat! say we. 
 The general strike is rousing and rallying increasing masses of the working class and the urban poor. 
 The arming of the people is becoming an immediate task of the revolutionary moment. 
 Only an armed people can be the real bulwark of popular liberty. 
 The sooner the proletariat succeeds in arming,and the longer it holds its fighting positions as striker andrevolutionary, the sooner will the army begin to waver;more and more soldiers will at last begin to realise what they are doing and they will join sides with the people against the fiends, against the tyrant, against the murderers of de-fenceless workers and of their wives and children. 
 No mat-ter what the outcome of the present uprising in St. 
 Peters-burg may be, it will, in any case, be the first step to a wider,more conscious, better organised uprising. 
 The government may possibly succeed in putting off the day of reckoning, but the postponement will only make the next step of therevolutionary onset more stupendous. 
 This will only meanthat the Social-Democrats will take advantage of this post-ponement to rally the organised fighters and spread thenews about the start made by the St. 
 Petersburg workers. 
 The proletariat will join in the struggle, it will quit mill and factory and will prepare arms for itself. 
 The slogansof the struggle for freedom will be carried more and morewidely into the midst of the urban poor and of the mil-lions of peasants. 
 Revolutionary committees will be set upat every factory, in every city district, in every large vil-lage. 
 The people in revolt will overthrow all the government institutions of the tsarist autocracy and proclaim theimmediate convocation of a Constituent Assembly. 
 The immediate arming of the workers and of all citizens in general, the preparation and organisation of the revolu-tionary forces for overthrowing the government authori-ties and institutions—this is the practical basis on which revolutionaries of every variety can and must unite tostrike the common blow. 
 The proletariat must always pur-sue its own independent path, never weakening its connec-tion with the Social-Democratic Party, always bearing inmind its great, ultimate objective, which is to rid mankind of all exploitation. 
 But this independence of the Social-Democratic proletarian party will never cause us to forgetthe importance of a common revolutionary onset at the moment of actual revolution. 
 We Social-Democrats can and must act independently of the bourgeois-democratic revolu-tionaries and guard the class independence of the proletar-iat. 
 But we must go hand in hand with them during theuprising, when direct blows are being struck at tsarism, whenresistance is offered the troops, when the bastilles of theaccursed enemy of the entire Russian people are stormed. 
 The proletariat of the whole world is now looking eagerly towards the proletariat of Russia. 
 The overthrow of tsar-ism in Russia, so valiantly begun by our working class,will be the turning-point in the history of all countries;it will facilitate the task of the workers of all nations, in allstates, in all parts of the globe. 
 Let, therefore, every Social-Democrat, every class-conscious worker bear in mind the immense tasks of the broad popular struggle that now rest upon his shoulders. 
 Let him not forget that he representsalso the needs and interests of the whole peasantry, of allwho toil, of all who are exploited, of the whole peopleagainst their enemy. 
 The proletarian heroes of St. 
 Petersburgnow stand as an example to all. 
 Long live the revolution! Long live the insurgent proletariat! Vperyod , No.

 4, Published according to January 31 (18), 1905 the text in Vperyod Checked against the manuscript 1 WHAT IS HAPPENING IN RUSSIA? Revolt or revolution? This is the question that Euro-pean journalists and reporters have been asking themselvesin connection with the events in St. 
 Petersburg, which theyare reporting to the whole world and attempting to evalu-ate. 
 Are they rebels or insurgents—the tens of thousandsof proletarians against whom the tsarist army successfully took the field? And the foreign papers, though sooner in a position to view the events with “detachment”, with theimpartiality of chroniclers, find it difficult to answer thequestion. 
 They are constantly getting their terms mixed. 
And small wonder. 
 It is not without reason that a revolu-tion is said to be a successful revolt, and a revolt an unsuc-cessful revolution. 
 People who witness the beginning of great and momentous events, who can obtain only veryincomplete, inexact, and third-hand information of whatis taking place, will not, of course, hazard a definite opin-ion until a timelier moment comes. 
 The bourgeois papers,which continue as of old to speak of revolt, rioting, and disturbances, cannot help seeing the truly national, nay, international, significance of these events. 
 Yet it is thissignificance which invests events with the character ofrevolution. 
 And those who have been writing of the last daysof the rioting find themselves involuntarily referring tothem as the first days of the revolution. 
 A turning-point in Russia’s history has been reached. 
 This is not denied even by the most hidebound of European conservatives,however enthusiastic and sentimental they may wax overthe mighty, unrestricted power of the all-Russian autocracy. 
Peace between the autocracy and the people is unthinkable. 
Revolution is not only in the mouths of a few fearless souls, not only of “nihilists”—as Europe persists in calling the Russian revolutionaries—but of every person capable oftaking any interest in world politics. 
 The Russian working-class movement has risen to a higher level in the last few days. 
 It is developing before our very eyes into a national uprising. 
 Naturally, here in Geneva, so damnably far away, we find it exceedingly difficult tokeep pace with events. 
 But so long as we have to linger atsuch an accursed distance, we must try to keep pace withevents, to sum them up, to draw conclusions, to draw fromthe experience of today’s happenings lessons that will be useful tomorrow, in another place, where today “the people are still mute” and where in the near future, in some formor other, a revolutionary conflagration will break out. 
 Wemust make it the constant job of publicists to write thehistory of the present day, and to try to write it in such away that our chronicles will give the greatest possible help to the direct participants in the movement and to the heroic proletarians there, on the scene of action—to write it insuch a way as to promote the spread of the movement, theconscious selection of the means, ways, and methods ofstruggle that, with the least expenditure of effort, willyield the most substantial and permanent results. 
 In the history of revolutions there come to light contra-dictions that have ripened for decades and centuries. 
 Lifebecomes unusually eventful. 
 The masses, which have al-ways stood in the shade and have therefore often been ig-nored and even despised by superficial observers, enter thepolitical arena as active combatants. 
 These masses are learn-ing in practice, and before the eyes of the world are taking their first tentative steps, feeling their way, defining theirobjectives, testing themselves and the theories of all theirideologists. 
 These masses are making heroic efforts to riseto the occasion and cope with the gigantic tasks of worldsignificance imposed upon them by history; and however great individual defeats may be, however shattering to us the rivers of blood and the thousands of victims, nothingwill ever compare in importance with this direct trainingthat the masses and the classes receive in the course of therevolutionary struggle itself. 
 The history of this struggleis measured in days. 
 And for good reason some foreign news-papers have already started a “diary of the Russian revolution”. 
 Let us, too, start one. 
 2 FATHER GAPON That Father Gapon is an agent-provocateur is a surmise that would seem to be borne out by the fact that he is amember and one of the ringleaders of the Zubatov society. 
 Furthermore, the foreign newspapers, like our own corre-spondents, note the fact that the police deliberately allowedthe strike movement to spread as widely and freely as pos-sible, and that the government generally (and Grand DukeVladimir in particular) wanted to provoke bloody reprisals under conditions most favourable to itself. 
 The English correspondents even point out that the energetic partici-pation of the Zubatovists in the movement could only havebeen of especial advantage to the government under thecircumstances. 
 The revolutionary intelligentsia and theclass-conscious proletarians, who would have been the mostlikely to provide themselves with arms, were bound to keep aloof from the Zubatov movement, to give it a wide berth. 
 The government thus had its hands free to play a winninggame. 
 The demonstration, so they reckoned, would be madeup of the most peaceful, least organised, and most back-ward workers; it would be child’s play for our soldiery tohandle them, and the proletariat would be taught a whole-some lesson; an excellent excuse would be furnished for shooting down anybody and everybody in the streets; atCourt the victory of the reactionary (or Grand Ducal) partyover the liberals would be complete; the harshest repres-sions would follow. 
 Both the English and the conservative German newspa-pers directly ascribe such a plan of action to the govern-ment (or to Vladimir). 
 It is most likely true. 
 The eventsof the bloody Ninth of January confirm this only too well. 
 But the existence of such a plan by no means rules out the possibility that Father Gapon was an unconscious instrument of this plan. 
 That there is a liberal, reformative movement among certain sections of the young Russian clergy cannotbe doubted; this movement has found its spokesmen bothat meetings of the religio-philosophic society and in churchpublications. 
 It has even been given a name of its own --the “New-Orthodox” movement. 
 We cannot, therefore, flatly dismiss the idea that Father Gapon may be a sincere Christian Socialist and that it was Bloody Sunday whichconverted him to the truly revolutionary path. 
 We areinclined to support this idea, especially since Gapon’sletters written after the massacre of January 9 declaringthat “we have no tsar”, his call to fight for freedom, etc. 
, are facts that speak for his honesty and sincerity; for it could not possibly be part of the duties of an agent-provo-cateur to agitate so powerfully for the continuation of the uprising. 
 However that may be, the policy of the Social-Democrats in regard to this new leader was self-evident: to maintain a careful, guarded, sceptical attitude towards this Zubato-vist; in any case, to participate vigorously in the initiatedstrike movement (even though it was initiated by a Zuba-tovist); to popularise energetically the Social-Democraticviews and slogans. 
 As appears from the letters printed above,these have been the tactics followed by our comrades on the St. 
 Petersburg Committee of the R.

P. 
 45 “Cun-ning” as the plans of the reactionary Court clique may havebeen, the realities of the class struggle and of the politicalprotest of the proletarians acting as the vanguard of thewhole people have proved infinitely more so. 
 That the plansof the police and the military have worked against the gov-ernment, that out of the Zubatov movement, which served as a minor cause, there has emerged a great and extensiverevolutionary movement embracing all Russia, is an estab-lished fact. 
 Despite all police snares and stratagems, therevolutionary energy and the revolutionary instinct of theworking class have asserted themselves with irresistible force. 
 3 THE PLAN OF THE ST. 
 PETERSBURG BATTLE It seems strange, at first glance, to refer to the peaceful march of unarmed workers to present a petition as a battle. 
 It was a massacre. 
 But the government had looked forward to a battle, and it doubtlessly acted according to a well-laid plan. 
 It considered the defence of St. 
 Petersburgand of the Winter Palace from the military standpoint. 
It took all necessary military measures. 
 It removed allthe civil authorities, and placed the capital with its mil-lion and a half population under the complete control of the generals (headed by Grand Duke Vladimir), who werethirsting for the blood of the people. 
 The government deliberately drove the proletariat to revolt, provoked it, by the massacre of unarmed people,to erect barricades, in order to drown the uprising in a sea of blood. 
 The proletariat will learn from these military lessons afforded by the government. 
 For one thing, it willlearn the art of civil war, now that it has started the revo-lution. 
 Revolution is war. 
 Of all the wars known in his-tory it is the only lawful, rightful, just, and truly greatwar. 
 This war is not waged in the selfish interests of a hand-ful of rulers and exploiters, like any and all other wars, but in the interests of the masses of the people against thetyrants, in the interests of the toiling and exploited millionsupon millions against despotism and violence. 
 All detached observers now are of one accord in admitting that in Russia this war has been declared and begun. 
 The proletariat will rise again in still greater masses. 
 What is left of the childish faith in the tsar will now vanish asquickly as the St. 
 Petersburg workers changed from petitioning to barricade fighting. 
 The workers everywhere will arm. 
 What matters it that the police will keep a tenfold greater watch over the arsenals and arms stores and shops? No stringencies, no prohibitions will stop the masses in thecities, once they have come to realise that without armsthey can always be shot down by the government on theslightest pretext. 
 Everyone will try his hardest to get him-self a gun or at least a revolver, to conceal his fire-arms from the police and be ready to repel any attack of the blood-thirsty servitors of tsarism. 
 Every beginning is difficult,as the saying goes. 
 It was very difficult for the workers togo over to the armed combat. 
 The government has now forcedthem to it. 
 The first and most difficult step has beentaken. 
 An English correspondent reports a typical conversation among workers in a Moscow street. 
 A group of workers wasopenly discussing the lessons of the day. 
 “Hatchets?” saidone. 
 “No, you can’t do anything with a hatchet againsta sabre. 
 You can’t get at him with a hatchet any more thanyou can with a knife. 
 No, what we need is revolvers, revolv-ers at the very least, and better still, guns. 
” Such conver-sations can be heard now all over Russia. 
 And these con-versations after “Vladimir’s Day” in St. 
 Petersburg willnot remain mere talk. 
 The military plan of the tsar’s uncle, Vladimir, who directed the massacre, was to keep the people from the suburbs, the workers’ suburbs, away from the centre of the city. 
 No pains were spared to make the soldiers believe thatthe workers wanted to demolish the Winter Palace (by meansof icons, crosses, and petitions!) and kill the tsar. 
 The stra-tegic task was simply to guard the bridges and the mainstreets leading to the Palace Square. 
 And the principal scenes of “military operations” were the squares near the bridges (the Troitsky, Samsonievsky, Nikolayevsky, and Palacebridges), as well as the streets leading from the working-class districts to the centre (the Narvskaya Zastava, Schlüs-selburg Highway, and Nevsky Prospekt), and, lastly, thePalace Square itself, to which thousands upon thousands of workers penetrated in spite of the massed troops and the resistance they met with. 
 Military operations were,of course, rendered much easier by the fact that everybody knew perfectly well where the workers were going, that there was but one rallying point and one objective. 
 The valiant generals attacked “successfully” an enemy who had come unarmed and made his destination and purpose knownin advance.... 
 It was a dastardly, cold-blooded massacre ofdefenceless and peaceful people. 
 For a long time to comenow the masses will think over and relive in memoryand in story all that took place. 
 The sole and inevi-table conclusion drawn from these reflections, from the assimilation of “Vladimir’s lesson” in the minds of themasses, will be à la guerre comme à la guerre . 
 The working-class masses, and, following their lead, the massesof the rural poor, will realise that they are combatants ina war, and then ... then the next battles of our civil war will be fought according to plan, but no longer according to the “plan” of grand dukes and the tsars. 
 The call “To arms!”which sounded among a crowd of workers in NevskyProspekt on January 9 cannot die away now withoutreverberation.

 PETERSBURG BATTLE” The plan of the St. 
 Petersburg battle was described by us in Vperyod , No.

 * The English newspapers now give us some details of this plan which are not without interest. 
 The Grand Duke Vladimir appointed General Prince Vasil-chikov Commander of the Army in the Field. 
 The entirecapital was split up into areas among the officers. 
 The tsarplayed at war quite seriously, as though confronted by theinvasion of an armed foe.

 5 “OUR FATHER THE TSAR” AND THE BARRICADES In reviewing the events of Bloody Sunday one is struck by the combination of naïve patriarchal faith in the tsar and the fierce armed street fighting against the tsarist rule. 
The first day of the Russian revolution brought the oldRussia and the new face to face with startling force andshowed the death agony of the peasants’ age-old faith in“Our Father the Tsar”, and the birth of a revolutionary people, the urban proletariat. 
 No wonder the European bourgeois newspapers say that Russia of January 10 is nolonger the Russia of January 8. 
 No wonder the cited GermanSocial-Democratic newspaper 46 recalls how seventy years ago the working-class movement started in England, howin 1834 the English workers held street demonstrations to protest against the banning of the trade unions, how in 1838 they drew up the “People’s Charter” at monster meet-ings near Manchester, and how Parson Stephens pro-claimed “the right of every man that breathes God’s freeair and treads upon God’s free earth to have his homeand hearth”. 
 And the same parson called on the assembled workers to take up arms. 
 Here, in Russia, too, a priest found himself at the head of the movement; one day he appealed for a march with a peace-ful petition to the tsar himself, and the next day he issueda call for revolution. 
 “Comrades, Russian workers!” FatherGeorgi Gapon wrote, after that bloody day, in a letter read at a meeting of liberals. 
 “We no longer have a tsar. 
 Today a river of blood divides him from the Russian peo-ple. 
 It is time for the Russian workers to begin the strugglefor the people’s freedom without him. 
 For today I giveyou my blessing. 
 Tomorrow I shall be with you. 
 TodayI am busy working for our cause. 
” This is not Father Georgi Gapon speaking. 
 This is the voice of those thousands upon thousands, of those millionsupon millions of Russian workers and peasants who until now could believe naively and blindly in the Tsar Father and seek alleviation of their unbearable lot from Our Fa-ther the Tsar “himself”, who put the blame for all the at-rocities and outrages, the tyranny and plunder, only o n the officials that were deceiving the tsar. 
 Generation aftergeneration of downtrodden, half-civilised, rustic existencecut off from the world tended to strengthen this faith. 
Every month of life of the new, urban, industrial, literate Russia has been undermining and destroying this faith. 
 The past decade of the working-class movement has pro-duced thousands of advanced proletarian Social-Democratswho have consciously broken with this faith. 
 It has edu-cated scores of thousands of workers in whom the classinstinct, strengthened in the strike movement and fostered by political agitation, has shattered this faith to its foun-dations. 
 Behind these scores of thousands, however, stoodhundreds of thousands, millions, of toiling and exploitedpeople, proletarians and semi-proletarians, suffering everyinsult and indignity, in whom this faith could still survive. 
They were not ready for revolt, they could only beg and plead. 
 Their feelings and their mood, their level of knowl-edge and political experience were expressed by FatherGeorgi Gapon; herein lies the historic significance of therole played at the beginning of the Russian revolution bya man who, but yesterday unknown, has today becomethe hero of the hour in St. 
 Petersburg and, as a result, in the entire European press. 
 It is clear now why the St. 
 Petersburg Social-Demo-crats, whose letters we quoted above, at first treated Ga-pon, as they could not help doing, with distrust. 
 A manwho wore the cassock, who believed in God and acted un-der the august patronage of Zubatov and the secret police, could not but arouse suspicion. 
 Whether he was sincere or not in rending his cassock and cursing the fact that hebelonged to that vile social-estate, the priesthood, whichrobs and demoralises the people, no one could say withcertainty, beyond those who knew him well personally,that is, a mere handful. 
 Only the course of historical events could decide this, only facts, facts, facts. 
 And the facts decided in Gapon’s favour. 
 Will Social-Democracy be able to gain the lead of this spontaneous movement? our St. 
 Petersburg comrades asked themselves with concern, seeing the swift irresistible growth of the general strike, which is involving unusu-ally broad strata of the proletariat, seeing the magnet-ism of Gapon’s influence on the “backward” masses whowere so ignorant that they could be swept off their feeteven by an agent-provocateur . 
 And the Social-Democrats not only did not encourage any naïve illusions with regard to the possibility of peaceful petitioning but, on the con-trary, opposed Gapon in argument, openly and firmlydefending all their views and their tactical line. 
 History,which the working-class masses were making withoutSocial-Democracy, has confirmed the correctness of theseviews and the tactical line. 
 The logic of the proletariat’s class position proved stronger than Gapon’s mistakes, naïvetés, and illusions. 
 Grand Duke Vladimir, acting onbehalf of the tsar and invested with all the power of thetsar, undertook by his executioner’s exploit to demonstrateto the working-class masses the very thing that the Social-Democrats have always demonstrated and will continue to demonstrate to them through the printed and spoken word. 
 The masses of workers and peasants who still retained a vestige of faith in the tsar were not ready for insurrection,we said. 
 After January 9 we have the right to say that nowthey are ready for insurrection and will rise. 
 By his massacreof unarmed workers “Our Father the Tsar” himself has driven them to the barricades and given them their first lessons in barricade fighting. 
 The lessons of “Our Father the Tsar”will not be lost. 
 It remains for the Social-Democrats to see to it that the news of the bloody days in St. 
 Petersburg is spread as farand as wide as possible; to rally and organise their forces still better and popularise still more energetically the slogan they have long since advanced: general armed uprising of the people . 
 * *True, our wise new-Iskrists (wise à la Martynov) have done their best to confuse, weaken and drag back this slogan (cf. 
 the Editorial,Iskra , No. 
 62, “Are We Preparing the Right Way?”). 
 The new-Iskra Martynovism, however, is meeting with a determined rebuff in our Party, especially since the famous plan for an “agreement” with the Zemstvo people on not causing panic fear. 
 6 THE FIRST STEPS The fire was sparked off by a quite ordinary clash between labour and capital—a strike at a factory. 
 It is interestingto note, however, that this strike of twelve thousand Pu-tilov workers, which broke out on Monday, January 3, was before everything a strike in the name of proletariansolidarity. 
 It was caused by the dismissal of four workers. 
“When the demand for their reinstatement was turneddown,” writes a comrade from St. 
 Petersburg on January 7,“the factory struck work immediately to a man. 
 The strike is fully disciplined. 
 The workers put several men to pro-tect the machines and other property against possibledamage by the less class-conscious workers. 
 They thensent a delegation to other factories to communicate to themtheir demands and to ask them to join the strike. 
” Manythousands of workers began to join the movement. 
 The legal Zubatov workers’ society, sponsored by the govern-ment in order to demoralise the proletariat by systematicmonarchist propaganda, rendered no little service in or-ganising the movement in its early stages and in extendingit. 
 What happened was something that the Social-Democratshad long pointed out to the Zubatovists, namely, that the revolutionary instinct of the working class and the spirit of solidarity would prevail over all petty police ruses. 
The most backward workers would be drawn into the move-ment by the Zubatovists, and then the tsarist govern-ment would itself take care to drive the workers farther;capitalist exploitation itself would turn them away from the peaceable and out-and-out hypocritical Zubatov fold to-wards revolutionary Social-Democracy. 
 The practice ofproletarian life and proletarian struggle would prove superior to all the “theories” and all the vain efforts of the Zubatov gentry. 
 * And that is what has happened. 
 One comrade, a worker and member of the St. 
 Petersburg Committee of the RussianSocial-Democratic Labour Party, gives his impressionsas follows in a letter addressed to us under date of January 5. 
 “I am writing under the fresh impression of a meeting of workers of the Semyannikov Shipyard just held at the Nevskaya Zastava. 
 But first, a word about the feeling among the St. 
 Petersburg workers. 
 As you know, ‘ Zubatov ’ organisations have lately begun to crop up here , or rather are being revived under the leadership of the priest Gapon . 
 These organisations have grown considerably in numberand strength in a very short time . 
 There are now 11 branches of the so-called Russian Factory Workers’ Assembly . 
 As was to be expected , the results of these meetings were inevitably the same as in the South . 
 “We can now say with certainty that a sweeping strike move-ment is starting in St. 
 Petersburg . 
 Almost every day you hear of a new strike at one or another factory . 
 The Putilov Works has been on strike now for two days . 
 About a fortnight ago the Schau Cotton Mills in the Vyborg Quarter went onstrike. 
 The strike lasted about four days. 
 The workers lostit. 
 The strike may break out anew any day. 
 A fightingspirit prevails everywhere, but it could hardly be said tobe in favour of the Social-Democratic line. 
 Most of the workers stand for a purely economic struggle and against a political one. 
 However, we may expect and hope that thisfeeling will change and the workers will realise that with-out a political struggle they can achieve no economic im-provements. 
 Today the Nevsky Shipyard (Semyannikov’s)went on strike. 
 The local branch of the Russian Factory Workers’ Assembly is trying to lead the strike, but it will not succeed, of course. 
 The Social-Democrats will be theleaders, notwithstanding the fact that they are woefullyweak here. 
 “Leaflets have been issued by the St. 
 Petersburg Commit-tee: two addressed to the Schau Cotton Mills and one to *Cf. 
 Lenin, What Is To Be Done? , pp. 
 86-88. 
 (See present edition, Vol. 
 5, pp. 
 454-56. 
— Ed. 
) the Putilov workers. 
 A meeting of the Nevsky Shipyard workers was held today. 
 It drew about 500 workers. 
 Mem-bers of the local branch of the Assembly spoke for the first time. 
 They avoided political demands and put forwardchiefly economic demands. 
 Shouts of disapproval wereheard in the crowd. 
 At this point Stroyev, of Russkaya Gazeta , who is greatly respected among the St. 
 Petersburg workers, came forward and proposed a resolution, which, he said, had been drafted by him and representatives of Social-Democracy. 
 The resolution, though emphasisingthe antagonism of class interests between the proletariatand the bourgeoisie, did this inadequately. 
 Social-Demo-cratic workers spoke after Stroyev and supported theresolution in principle, although stressing its limited character and its inadequacy. 
 This started a commotion; some of those present did not like the speeches of theSocial-Democrats and tried to obstruct the meeting. 
 Themajority voted against the chairman, who was among theobstructionists, and elected a new chairman, a socialist. 
The members of the (Zubatov) ‘society’, however, refused to keep silent and continued to make disturbances. 
 Al-though the overwhelming majority of the meeting (90 percent) sided with the socialists, the meeting in the long runbroke up without achieving anything and postponed itsdecision until the next day. 
 One thing can be said at anyrate—the Social-Democrats succeeded in turning the mood of the workers in their favour. 
 Tomorrow there is to be a big meeting. 
 There may be two or three thousand peoplethere. 
 An imposing demonstration is to be expected oneof these days, something like the July demonstration inthe South in 1903. 
 The Franco-Russian Society Works ison strike—about four to five thousand people. 
 They say a strike has started at the Stieglitz Cotton Mills—about five thousand. 
 A strike is expected at the Obukhov Works—five or six thousand. 
” Comparing this information of a Social-Democrat, a local committee-man (who could only know, of course,what was happening in a small area in St. 
 Petersburg), with the foreign press reports, especially the English, we are led to the conclusion that the latter are distinguishedby a high degree of accuracy. 
 The strike spread from day to day with amazing speed. 
 The workers held numerous meetings and drew up a “char-ter” of their own—their economic and political demands. 
 Both these demands, despite the Zubatovist leadership,coincided on the whole with the demands of the Social-Democratic Party programme, including the slogan forthe convocation of a Constituent Assembly on the basisof universal, direct, and equal suffrage by secret ballot. 
 The spontaneous growth of this strike, unexampled in point of magnitude, was far, far in advance of the plannedparticipation in the movement on the part of the organisedSocial-Democrats. 
 But let them speak for themselves. 
 7 THE EVE OF BLOODY SUNDAY In our account of the movement’s progress we stopped at the point at which, on the initiative of Gapon, the procession of the working-class masses to the Winter Pal-ace to present a “petition” to the tsar for convening a Con-stituent Assembly was set for Sunday, January 9. 
 By Sat-urday, the 8th, the strike in St. 
 Petersburg had becomea general strike. 
 Even official reports placed the number of strikers at 100-150 thousand. 
 Russia had never yet witnessed such a gigantic outbreak of the class struggle. 
The whole industrial, business, and public life of the greatcentre with its population of one and a half million wasparalysed. 
 The proletariat showed by deeds that moderncivilisation owes its existence to it and to it alone , that its labour creates wealth and luxury and that upon it rests our whole “culture”. 
 The city found itself without newspa-pers, without lighting, and without water. 
 And the generalstrike bore a clearly defined political character; it wasa direct prelude to the revolutionary events. 
 An eyewitness thus describes the eve of the historic day in a letter addressed to us: “Beginning with January 7 the strike in St. 
 Petersburg became a general strike. 
 Not only all the big factories andmills, but many workshops came to a standstill. 
 Today,January 8, not a single newspaper, except for Pravitelst-venny Vestnik 47 and Vedomosti S. 
 Peterburgskovo Grado-nachalstva ,* has appeared. 
 The leadership of the movement *St. 
 Petersburg City Administration News . 
—Ed. 
 is still in the hands of the Zubatovists. 
 We are witnessing an unprecedented scene in St. 
 Petersburg, and the suspense makes one’s heart contract with fear as to whether the Social-Democratic organisation will be able to take themovement into its own hands, at least after a while. 
 Thesituation is extremely grave. 
 Throughout these past daysmass meetings of workers are daily taking place in allcity districts at the headquarters of the ‘Association of Russian Workers’. 
 The surrounding streets are filled with thousands of workers. 
 From time to time the Social-Democrats make speeches and distribute leaflets. 
 They arereceived on the whole sympathetically, although the Zu-batovists try to set up an opposition. 
 When the autocracyis mentioned, the Zubatov people shout: ‘We don’t care about that, the autocracy doesn’t stand in our way!’ On the other hand, the speeches which the Zubatovists makeat the ‘Association’ headquarters contain all the Social-Democratic demands, beginning with the eight-hour dayand ending with the convocation of a Constituent Assemblyon the basis of equal and direct suffrage by secret ballot. 
 Only the Zubatovists assert that the granting of these demands implies, not the overthrow of the autocracy,but the bringing of the people closer to the tsar and theelimination of the bureaucracy, which stands betweenthe tsar and the people. 
 “The Social-Democrats address meetings, too, in the headquarters of the Association, and their speeches are listened to sympathetically; but the initiative in prac-tical proposals comes from the Zubatovists. 
 Despite theobjections of the Social-Democrats, these proposals areadopted. 
 They boil down to the following: on Sunday,January 9, the workers are to go to the Winter Palace and, through the priest Georgi Gapon, hand the tsar a petition listing all the demands of the workers and ending withthe words, ‘Give us all this or we must die’. 
 Those whodirect the meetings add: ‘If the tsar refuses, then our handswill be untied; for it means that he is our enemy, and thenwe will come out against him and unfurl the red banner. 
 If our blood is shed, it will be upon his head. 
’ The petition is being adopted everywhere. 
 The workers swear that theywill come out into the square on Sunday ‘with their wives and children’. 
 Today the petition is going to be signed by districts, and at 2 o’clock all are to assemble at the ‘People’s House’ for the final meeting. 
 “All this is taking place with the full connivance of the police, who have been everywhere withdrawn, althoughsome buildings have mounted gendarmes hidden in theyards. 
 “Today the streets are placarded with notices from the City Administrator banning meetings and threatening the use of armed force. 
 The workers tear them off. 
 Troopsare being drawn up into the city from the environs. 
 Thetramway employees (conductors and drivers) have beenforced to go to work by Cossacks with drawn sabres. 
” 8 THE NUMBER OF KILLED OR WOUNDED Reports as to the number of killed or wounded differ. 
 Naturally, there can be no question of an exact count, and a visual estimate is very difficult. 
 The government’s re-port giving 96 killed and 330 wounded is obviously false,and no one believes it. 
 According to the latest press reports,journalists handed the Minister of the Interior a list of 4,600 killed or wounded , as compiled by reporters. 
 Of course, even this figure cannot be complete, since it would be impossible even in the day-time (let alone at night) to count all the killed and wounded in the various clashes. 
 The victory of the autocracy over the unarmed people took a toll no smaller than did the big battles in Man-churia. 
 No wonder the St. 
 Petersburg workers, accordingto the reports of foreign correspondents, cried out to the officers that they were more successful at fighting the Russian people than they were the Japanese. 
 9 THE BATTLES ON THE BARRICADES48 As we have seen, most of the correspondents’ reports refer to the barricades on Vasilyevsky Island, and partly in Nevsky Prospekt. 
 The official report published on Mon-day, January 10 (23), reads: “The mob threw up barricadeswith barbed wire entanglements and red flags on the Schlüs-selburg Highway, then at the Narvskaya Zastava, on theTroitsky Bridge, at the Alexandrovsky Gardens, and atthe public gardens in Nevsky Prospekt. 
 Stones were thrown and shots fired at the troops from the adjoining houses. 
 The crowd disarmed the police. 
 Schoff’s armoury was loot-ed. 
 In the first and second areas of Vasilyevsky Islandthe mob cut the telegraph-wires and knocked down thetelegraph-poles. 
 A police station was smashed up. 
” A French correspondent telegraphed at 2:50 p. 
m. 
 on Sunday: “Shooting is continuing. 
 The troops, apparently, have lost their head completely. 
 Crossing the Neva, I sawseveral signal lights and heard volleys of rifle shots. 
 OnVasilyevsky Island the barricades are illumined with bon-fires kindled by the strikers. 
 This was as far as I couldget. 
 A sinister bugle sound is the signal to fire; A bat-talion of soldiers with bayonetted rifles atilt charged a barri-cade made of piled up sleighs. 
 A real massacre started. 
The bodies of about a hundred workers were strewn overthe scene of battle. 
 Some fifty wounded prisoners wereescorted past me. 
 The officer threatened me with his pistoland ordered me to be off. 
” Correspondents give very few details of the barricade fighting. 
 This is understandable, because they tried to keep more or less at a safe distance from the danger spots. 
 As for the participants in the barricade fighting, probably only very few survived. 
 There is even a report that the barricades were subjected to artillery fire, but it does not seem to have been confirmed. 
 Published according to the manuscript /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR THE TSARIST PEACE The foreign press reported that at recent conferences in Tsarskoye Selo (after the victory of January 9), withor without the tsar attending, the question of the desir-ability of peace with Japan was animatedly discussed. 
 In principle, all who surround the adored monarch standfor peace now. 
 The number of state dignitaries who tendays ago were emphatically for continuing the war hasnow dwindled considerably, and many of them have nowbecome convinced advocates of peace. 
 We mention this for the information of the simple So-cial-Democrats of the so-called Central Organ of our Party,who failed to understand that the phrases about “peace at any price ”, while remaining empty phrases (for no one asked the opinion of the Social-Democrats, and their opinioncounted for nought), actually, in the present situation, have merely played into the hands of the frightened adherents of the autocracy. 
 Our new-Iskrists missed the change ofmood on the part of the whole European bourgeoisie (whichbegan with sympathy towards Japan and has long sincestarted to shift in favour of Russia through fear of the rev-olution—cf. 
 Frankfurter Zeitung and others). 
 Now they miss the fact that the empty, hackneyed phrases about peace at any price are beginning to be utilised also by the St. 
 Petersburg Ugryum-Burcheyevs 49 for their own purpose.

50 In his letter of February 1, 1905, to the editors of the newspaper Vperyod (Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party), the well-known leader of the Swiss Social-Demo-crats, Hermann Greulich, incidentally expressed his regret at the new split in the ranks of the Russian Social-Demo-crats and remarked: “ Wer die grössere Schuld an dieser Zersplitterung trägt , das werde ich nicht entscheiden und ich habe den internationalen Entscheid bei der deutschenParteileitung angeregt ” (“I do not undertake to decide who is more to blame for this split. 
 I have proposed to the lead-ership of the German Social-Democratic Party that thisquestion be settled through international channels”). 
 The editors of Vperyod , together with Comrade Stepanov, representative abroad of the Russian Bureau of Committeesof the Majority, answered Greulich in the letter appended below. 
 Since Comrade Greulich intends to call for an interna-tional decision, we are communicating to all friends ofVperyod in foreign countries the contents of our letter to him and request them to translate it into their respective languages, and to bring it to the notice of the greatest possible number of foreign Social-Democrats. 
 It is also desirable to translate into foreign languages Lenin’s Statement and Documents on the Break of the Cen-tral Institutions with the Party , as well as: (1) the resolu-tions of the Northern Conference, (2) the resolutions ofthe Caucasian Conference; and (3) the resolutions of the Southern Conference. 
 Please let us know whether this request will be carried out. 
 THE LETTER TO GREULICH February 3, 1905 Dear Comrade, In your letter you touch on the question of which group of our Party (the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
) is to blame for the split. 
You say that you have asked for the opinion of the Ger-man Social-Democrats and the International Bureau on this point. 
 In view of this, we feel bound to explain to you how the split occurred. 
 We shall confine ourselves to thepresentation of definitely proved facts and refrain, as far as possible, from an evaluation of the facts. 
 Until the end of 1903, our Party was the aggregate of the disconnected local Social-Democratic organisations called committees . 
 The Central Committee and the Central Organ elected at the Party’s First Congress (in the springof 1898) were non-existent. 
 They had been suppressed bythe police and never been revived. 
 Abroad, a split hadoccurred between the Union of Russian Social-Democrats(publication— Rabocheye Dyelo ; hence, Rabocheye Dyelo -ists) and Plekhanov. 
 Iskra , founded in 1900, sided with the latter. 
 In the space of three years, between 1900 and1903, Iskra gained overwhelming influence among the Russian committees. 
 Iskra upheld the principles of revolu-tionary Social-Democracy against “Economism” (alias Ra-bocheye Dyelo -ism =Russian variety of opportunism). 
 The lack of unity in the Party was felt keenly by all. 
 Finally, in August 1903, it became possible, abroad, to assemble the Second Party Congress , at which were repre-sented all the Russian committees, the Bund51 (independ-ent organisation of the Jewish proletariat), and both groups abroad—the Iskra group and the Rabocheye Dyelo group. 
 All participants in the Congress recognised its validity. 
 The struggle at the Congress was between the Iskrists andthe anti-Iskrists (the Rabocheye Dyelo -ists and the Bund); in between was the so-called “Marsh”. 
 The Iskrists carriedthe day. 
 They achieved the adoption of the Party pro-gramme ( Iskra ’s draft). 
 Iskra was recognised as the Central Organ, and its line as the line of the Party. 
 A number ofresolutions on tactics were Iskrist in spirit, and the accepted Rules on organisation (Lenin’s draft) were Iskrist. 
 Only with respect to certain details were the Rules marred by the anti-Iskrists with the aid of a minority of the Iskrists. 
 The voting at the Congress was as follows: of the total 51votes, 33 were Iskra (24 Iskrists of the present Majority and 9 of the present Minority ), 10 were “Marsh”, and 8 were anti-Iskrists (3 Rabocheye Dyelo -ists and 5 Bundists). 
 Towards the end of the Congress, before the elections, seven delegates (2 Rabocheye Dyelo -ists and the 5 Bundists) walked out. 
 (The Bund withdrew from the Party. 
) The minority of the Iskrists, supported, because of their mistakes, by all the anti-Iskrists and the “Marsh”, becamethe minority of the Congress (24 against 9 &10&1, or, 24 against 20). 
 At the election of the central bodies it was decided to choose three persons to the Editorial Board of the Central Organ and three to the Central Committee. 
Out of the six members who constituted the old EditorialBoard of Iskra —Plekhanov, Axelrod, Zasulich, Starover, Lenin, and Martov—there were elected Plekhanov, Lenin,and Martov. 
 The intention was that the Central Committee should consist of two elected from the majority and one from the minority. 
 Martov refused to take his seat on the Editorial Board without the three “excluded” (non-elected) comrades, andthe entire minority refused to participate in the electionof a Central Committee. 
 No one ever disputed or disputes now the validity of the elections, but after the Congress the Minority refused to work under the leadership of thecentres elected by the Congress. 
 This boycott continued for three months, from the end of August to the end of November 1903. 
 I s k r a (six issues , Nos. 
 46-51) was edited by Plekhanov and Lenin alone . 
 The Minority formed a secret organisation within the Party (a fact now corroborated in the press by the Minority follow-ers themselves and denied by no one at the present time). 
 The overwhelming majority of the Russian committees(12 of the 14 that had managed to go on record at the time)condemned this disruptive boycott. 
 But Plekhanov, following the turbulent congress of the League Abroad 52 (=the Party organisation abroad), which took place in the last days of October 1903, decided to give way to the Minority, declaring before the whole Party in the article “What Should Not Be Done” ( Iskra , No. 
 52, November 1903) that for the sake of avoiding a split one must at times make concessions even to those wholean in error towards revisionism and act as anarcho-indi-vidualists (the underlined expressions are employed by Plekhanov literally in his article “What Should Not BeDone”). 
 Lenin withdrew from the Editorial Board, not wishing to go against the decisions of the Congress. 
 Ple-khanov then co-opted all the four former editors. 
 The Rus-sian committees declared that they would wait and seewhat line the new Iskra would take and whether the Men-sheviks had really joined the Editorial Board with peacefulintentions. 
 Precisely what the Bolsheviks had predicted came to pass. 
 The old-Iskra line was not retained, nor was peace brought into the Party by the new, Menshevik EditorialBoard. 
 The Iskra line veered so sharply towards the old Rabocheye Dyelo -ism, which had been repudiated by the Second Congress, that even Trotsky, a prominent member of the Minority, author of the programmatic pamphlet Our Political Tasks , which appeared under the editor-ship of the new “Iskra”, stated literally: “ T h e r e i s a g u l f b e t w e e n t h e o l d ‘I s k r a ’ a n d t h e n e w ‘I s k r a ’. 
” We confine ourselves to this declaration, made by one of our opponents, in order not to have to go into lengthy explanations concerning the instability of Iskra on questions of principle. 
 On the other hand, “the secret organisation of the Mi-nority” was not disbanded, but continued its boycott of theCentral Committee. 
 This covert split of the Party intoan open and a secret organisation was an intolerable hin-drance to the work. 
 An overwhelming majority of the Rus-sian committees that took a position on the crisis emphat-ically condemned both the line of the new Iskra and the disorganising behaviour of the Minority. 
 A general clamourwas raised on all sides for the immediate summoning ofa Third Congress, to find some way out of the intolerable situation. 
 Under our Party Rules, a special congress may be called only on the demand of organisations commanding in the aggregate at least one half of the total votes (regular congresses are called, “as far as possible”, every two years). 
 T h i s h a l f h a d b e e n m u s t e r e d a l r e a d y . 
 But here the C. 
C. 
 played the Majority false by taking advantageof the fact that several of its members belonging to the Major-ity had been arrested. 
 Under the pretext of “reconciliation”,the members of the C. 
C. 
 who had escaped arrest made a deal with the secret organisation of the Minority and declared that the organisation had been dissolved; at the same time, in spite of the written declarations of the C. 
C. 
 and behind theback of the Party, three Mensheviks were co-opted into the C. 
C. 
 This co-optation took place in November or December 1904. 
 Thus, the Minority was fighting from August 1903 toNovember 1904, tearing the Party asunder, for the sake of co-opting three persons into the Central Organ and three into the C. 
C. 
 The spurious central institutions thus formed met the demand for another congress with silence or abuse. 
 Then the patience of the Russian committees gave out. 
 They began to call their own private conferences. 
 So far three such conferences have been held: (1) the Conference of the four Caucasian committees; (2) the Conference ofthree southern committees (Odessa, Nikolayev, and Ekate-rinoslav); and (3) the Conference of six northern committees(St. 
 Petersburg, Moscow, Tver, Riga, “the North”—i. 
e. 
,Yaroslavl, Kostroma, and Vladimir—and, lastly, Nizhni-Novgorod). 
 All these conferences declared for the “Majority”, decided to support the publicists’ group of the Majority (thegroup consisting of Lenin, Ryadovoi, Orlovsky, Galyorka, 53 Voinov,54 and others), and elected t h e i r o w n B u r e a u . 
 This Bureau was instructed by the third, viz. 
, the Northern,conference to constitute itself as an Organising Committee and to convene a congress of the Russian committees, i. 
e. 
, the Third Congress of the Party, without regard for the cen-tres abroad that had split from the Party. 
 This is how things stood on January 1, 1905 (new style). 
 The Bureau of Committees of the Majority has begun itswork (conditions in our police-ridden country are such that the convening of the Congress will, of course, be delayed for a few months; the Second Congress was announced in Decem-ber 1902, but was not convened until August 1903). 
 The publicists’ group of the Majority founded an organ of the Majority , the newspaper Vperyod , published as a w e e k l y since January 4 (N. 
 S. 
), 1905. 
 To date (February 3, 1905) four numbers have already appeared. 
 The line of Vperyod i s the line of the old “Iskra ”. 
 In the name of the old Iskra , Vperyod resolutely combats the new Iskra . 
 Hence, in actual fact, there are now two Russian Social-Democratic Labour Parties. 
 One has the organ Iskra , “officially” called the Central Organ of the Party; it has the C. 
C. 
, and four committees in Russia out of twenty (the other committees in Russia, apart from the twenty representedat the Second Congress, were organised later, and the valid-ity of their confirmation is still in dispute). 
 The otherparty has the organ Vperyod , the Bureau of Russian Commit-tees of the Majority, fourteen committees in Russia (the thirteen above-named committees and the Voronezh Com-mittee, and most likely also the committees of Saratov, theUrals, Tula, and Siberia *). 
 The new-Iskrists have on their side all the opponents of the old Iskra , all the Rabocheye Dyelo -ists, and a large part of the intelligentsia or the fringe of the Party. 
 The Vperyod -ists have on their side all who followed the old Iskra from conviction and on principle, as well as a large part of the class-conscious, advanced workers, and of thepractical Party functionaries in Russia. 
 Plekhanov, whowas a Bolshevik at the Second Party Congress (August 1903) and at the Congress of the League (October 1903), but who has been fighting the “Majority” furiously since November1903, declared publicly on September 2, 1904 (this statement has appeared in print) that the forces on both sides wereapproximately equal. 
 We Bolsheviks maintain that we have on our side the majority of real Party workers active in Russia. 
 We con-sider that the main cause of the split and the chief obstacleto unity is the disruptive behaviour of the Minority, whichrefused to bow to the decisions of the Second Congress andpreferred to have a split rather than call the Third Congress. 
 At the present time the Mensheviks are splitting the local *At least all the four last-named committees declared for the “Majority” after the Second Party Congress. 
 organisations everywhere in Russia. 
 In St. 
 Petersburg, for instance, they prevented the Committee from organising a demonstration on November 28 (see Vperyod , No. 
 1 *). 
 Now they have broken away in St. 
 Petersburg as a separategroup known as the “Group Attached to the Central Commit-tee” and work against the local committee of the Party. 
Recently they organised in Odessa another such local (“Cen-tral Committee”) group for fighting the Party Committee. 
 The falsity of their position has made the Menshevik central institutions disorganise the local work of the Party, sincethese central bodies did not want to accept the decisionof the Party committees that had elected them. 
 The differences in principle between Vperyod and new Iskra are essentially the same as those between the old Iskra and Rabocheye Dyelo . 
 We consider these differences important, but, given the opportunity fully to defend ourviews, the views of the old Iskra , we would not consider these differences of themselves to be a bar to working together inone Party.

 TREPOV IN THE SADDLE Cruel reprisals against all the discontented have become the government’s slogan since January 9. 
 On Tuesday, Tre-pov, one of the most hated servitors of tsarism in the whole of Russia, notorious in Moscow for his brutality, his coarse-ness, and his participation in the Zubatovist attempts todemoralise the workers, was appointed Governor-General ofSt. 
 Petersburg with dictatorial powers. 
 Arrests came thick and fast as from a horn of plenty. 
 The first to be arrested were the members of the liberal delega-tion, which, late on Saturday evening, had gone to Witteand Svyatopolk-Mirsky to request the government to receivethe workers’ petition and not to order the troops to fireon the peaceful demonstration. 
 It goes without saying thatthese requests proved of no avail. 
 Witte referred the delega-tion to Svyatopolk-Mirsky; the latter refused to receive it. 
 The Deputy-Minister of the Interior, Rydziewski, receivedthe delegation very coldly and declared that it was not thegovernment that had to be persuaded, but the workers, thatthe government was fully informed of everything that wasgoing on, and that it had already made decisions which no requests could alter. 
 It is interesting that at the meeting of the liberals which appointed this delegation the suggestionhad even been made to dissuade the workers from marchingto the Winter Palace, upon which a friend of Gapon’s whowas present at the meeting declared that this would be use-less, since the workers’ decision was irrevocable. 
 (This in-formation was reported by Mr. 
 Dillon, correspondent of the English Daily Telegraph , and subsequently corroborated by other correspondents. 
) The members of the delegation—Gessen, Arsenyev, Kareyev, Peshekhonov, Myakotin, Semevsky, Kedrin, Shnitnikov, Ivanchin-Pisarev, and Gorky (who was arrest-ed in Riga and brought to St. 
 Petersburg)—were held incustody on the ridiculous charge that they intended to organ-ise a “provisional government of Russia” on the day afterthe revolution. 
 Such a charge, of course, is bound to collapseof itself. 
 A number of the arrested men (Arsenyev, Kedrin, and Shnitnikov) have been released. 
 A vigorous campaign in behalf of Gorky has been started in educated bourgeoiscircles abroad, and a petition to the tsar for his releasewas signed by many prominent German scientists and writers. 
These have now been joined by scientists and men of lettersin Austria, France, and Italy. 
 On Friday evening, four members of the staff of the newspaper Nasha Zhizn were arrested: Prokopovich and his wife, Khizhnyakov, and Yakovlev (Bogucharsky). 
 Of thestaff of the newspaper Nashi Dni , 55 Ganeiser was arrested on Saturday morning. 
 The police are trying very hard tointercept the funds sent from abroad for the strikers or for the widows and orphans of those killed in the massacre. 
 People are being arrested en masse . 
 The warrant for Bogu-charsky’s arrest was numbered 53 and for Khizhnyakov 109. 
On Saturday the offices of both mentioned papers were raid-ed and all manuscripts without exception were confiscated,including detailed accounts of the events of the entire week, accounts written and signed by reliable eyewitnesses who had noted down all they had seen for the edification of fu-ture generations. 
 None of this material will ever see the lightof day now. 
 On Wednesday the number of arrests was so considerable that the prisoners had to be placed two and three in a cell. 
 In the case of workers, the new dictator is casting all cere-mony aside. 
 Since Thursday they have been rounded up inbatches and hustled back to their home towns and villages. 
There they will, of course, spread the story of the eventsof January 9 and advocate struggle against the autocracy. 
 Trepov is falling back on his old Moscow tactics of ensnaring the working-class masses with economic sops. 
 Employers are conferring with the Minister of Finance to devise various concessions to the workers; there is talk of the nine-hour day. 
 On Tuesday the Minister of Finance re-ceived a delegation of workers, promised economic reforms, and warned against political agitation. 
 The police are trying their hardest to sow distrust and enmity between the general public and the workers. 
 Wednes-day’s reports in foreign newspapers state most definitelythat the police are trying to terrorise the population of St. 
Petersburg with lurid accounts of robberies and other atro-cious deeds alleged to have been committed by the strikers. 
 Deputy-Minister of the Interior Rydziewski himself assureda visitor on Tuesday that the strikers were out to loot, burn,destroy, and kill. 
 Wherever they have been able, the strik-ers—at least their class-conscious leaders—have brandedthis as slander. 
 The police themselves sent out agents-provo-cateurs and house janitors to smash windows , burn news-stands , and loot shops , in order to terrorise the population. 
 The workers, in fact, behaved so peacefully that they roused thewonder of the foreign press correspondents who had witnessedthe horrors of January 9. 
 The police agents are now busy with a new “workers’ organisation”. 
 They pick suitable elements from among the workers, supply them with money, set them on students andwriters, and praise “the true public-spirited policy of OurFather the Tsar”. 
 It is not difficult to find among two or threehundred thousand uneducated workers, crushed in spiritby starvation, a few thousand who will nibble at this bait. 
 These will be “organised”, they will be made to curse “the liberal frauds” and to declare loudly that they were fooledlast Sunday. 
 Then this scum of the working class will appointa delegation which will “humbly beseech the tsar to allowthem to fall at his feet and repent them of the crimes theycommitted last Sunday”. 
 “According to my information,” continues the correspondent, “this is precisely what the po-lice are now engaged in arranging. 
 After they have put thefinishing touches to this organisation, His Majesty will mostgraciously deign to receive the delegation in the Manège,which will be specially prepared for this occasion. 
 He willmake a moving speech professing His fatherly concern for the workers and His anxiety that measures be taken to improve their condition. 
” P. 
 S. 
 These lines were already set up in type when tele-grams arrived confirming the predictions of the English correspondent. 
 At his residence in Tsarskoye Selo the tsar received a delegation of thirty-four workers hand-picked by the police, and he delivered a speech reeking with officialhypocrisy about the government’s paternal solicitude andabout the forgiveness it held out to the offending workers. 
Of course, this ghastly farce will not deceive the Russianproletariat. 
 The proletariat will never forget Bloody Sunday. 
 It will yet speak to the tsar in a different strain.

 PETERSBURG AFTER JANUARY 9 On Monday, January 10, St. 
 Petersburg looked like a city just conquered by an enemy. 
 Cossack patrols kept rid-ing through the streets. 
 Here and there stood excited groups of workers. 
 In the evening many of the streets were plunged in darkness. 
 There was no electricity or gas. 
 The aristocratichouses were guarded by groups of janitors. 
 Blazing news-stands threw a lurid light on knots of people. 
 In Nevsky Prospekt there were clashes between the people and the military. 
 Shots were again fired at the crowd. 
 Three volleys were fired outside the Anichkov Palace. 
 The police shut the fire-arms shops and removed all weapons tothe cellars, taking apparently all possible measures toprevent the workers from arming. 
 The officials in thegovernment offices were particularly alarmed; they fearedfires and explosions and fled from St. 
 Petersburg in a panic. 
 The barricades which the troops had captured on Sunday on Vasilyevsky Island were thrown up again on Monday andwere recaptured by the soldiers. 
 There were no newspapers. 
 The schools were closed. 
 At numerous private meetings the workers discussed the eventsand measures of resistance. 
 Crowds of sympathisers, espe-cially students, besieged the hospitals. 
 The workers of Kolpino, twenty to thirty thousand strong, were said to have marched out to Tsarskoye Seloon Tuesday morning with a petition. 
 The garrison of Tsar-skoye Selo sent out a regiment of infantry and a field batteryto intercept them. 
 A clash occurred within five versts of Kolpino; the troops fired and finally repulsed and scattered the workers at 4 p. 
m. 
 There were many killed and wounded. 
The workers twice attacked the Tsarskoye Selo railway, but were repulsed. 
 The rails were pulled up for a distance of seven versts and no trains ran in the morning. 
 The government buried the victims of Bloody Vladimir Sunday at night, in secret. 
 The relatives and friends of theslain were deliberately misled, so that no demonstrationswould be held at the burials. 
 Corpses were taken to the Pre-obrazhensky Cemetery by the car-load. 
 In some placesthe crowd nevertheless attempted, despite all police pre-cautions, to hold demonstrations in honour of the fallen fighters for liberty. 
 Feeling against the army among the population ran high. 
 The foreign newspapers, on the basis of accounts byeyewitnesses, report that on Tuesday, January 11, the Cos-sacks stopped a horse tram full of workers in Bolshoi Prospekt. 
 One of the workers had shouted at the Cossacks, “Butchers!” The Cossacks stopped the tram, made all the passengers getout and beat them with the flats of their swords. 
 One ofthe men was wounded. 
 The tenants of nearby houses openedtheir windows and shouted at the Cossacks, “Murderers!Bandits!” Thursday’s telegrams reported that during this incident a woman passenger was also driven out of the tram by the Cossacks. 
 In her fright she dropped her child, whichwas trampled to death by the Cossacks’ horses ( The Times ). 
 Such victories of our troops over the workers are truly Pyrrhicvictories. 
 Vperyod , No. 
 5, Published according to February 7 (January 25), 1905 the text in Vperyod THE FIRST LESSONS The first wave of the revolutionary storm is receding. 
 We are on the eve of an inescapable, inevitable secondwave. 
 The proletarian movement is spreading wider and has now reached the remotest outlying regions of the country. 
 Unrest and discontent have seized the most diverse sectionsof society, even the most backward. 
 Commerce and industryare paralysed, schools are closed, and the Zemstvo employ-ees, following the example of the workers, have gone onstrike. 
 In the lulls between the mass actions, individual terrorist acts are, as usual, becoming more frequent: the attempt on the life of the Odessa Chief of Police, the assas-sination in the Caucasus, the assassination of the SenateProcurator in Helsingfors. 
 The government is veering fromthe policy of the bloody knout to a policy of prom-ises. 
 It tries to fool at least part of the workers with the tsar’s farcical reception of a delegation. 
 * It tries to divert public attention with war news, and it orders Kuropatkin tostart an offensive on the Hunho. 
 On January 9 the massacrein St. 
 Petersburg took place; the 12th saw the launching ofthe offensive, from the military point of view absolutelysenseless, which ended in another serious defeat of the tsar’s generals. 
 The Russians were repulsed with casualties, which even according to the Novoye Vremya correspondent amount-ed to 13,000 men, or about twice as many as the Japanese. 
There is the same corruption and demoralisation in thehandling of military affairs in Manchuria that there is in St. 
Petersburg. 
 In the foreign press, dispatches confirming and denying Kuropatkin’s quarrel with Grippenberg alternate *See pp. 
 134-35 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 with dispatches confirming and denying the news that the Grand Ducal party is alive to the danger which the war is creating for the autocracy and wants peace as quickly as possible. 
 Small wonder that under such circumstances even the most sober bourgeois papers of Europe never stop talking ofa revolution in Russia. 
 The revolution is growing and matur-ing with a rapidity unknown before January 9. 
 Whether the next wave will surge up tomorrow, the day after, or months hence, depends on quite a number of unpredictablecircumstances. 
 All the more urgent, therefore, is the taskof summing up the revolutionary events and drawing fromthem the lessons that may stand us in good stead muchsooner than some are inclined to expect. 
 To evaluate correctly the revolutionary events we should have to make a general survey of the most recent historyof our working-class movement. 
 Nearly twenty years ago,in 1885, the first big workers’ strikes took place in the cen-tral manufacturing district, at the Morozov Mills and else-where. 
 At that time Katkov wrote that the labour question had emerged in Russia. 
 With what astonishing speed the proletariat has developed, passing from economic strug-gles to political demonstrations, from demonstrationsto the revolutionary onset! Let us recall the chief mile-stones along the road traversed. 
 1885—widespread strikes,in which an insignificant number of socialists participated, acting entirely individually, not united in any organisations. 
 Public sentiment over the strikes compelled Katkov, thatfaithful watchdog of the autocracy, to speak, in reference tothe trial, about a “one-hundred-and-one gun salute in honourof the labour question which has emerged in Russia”. 
 Thegovernment made economic concessions. 
 1891—participation of the St. 
 Petersburg workers in the demonstration at Shel-gunov’s funeral 56; political speeches at the St. 
 Petersburg May Day rally. 
 We had here a Social-Democratic demonstra-tion of the advanced workers in the absence of a mass move-ment. 
 1896—the St. 
 Petersburg strike involving scores ofthousands of workers. 
 A mass movement and the beginnings of street agitation, this time with the participation of an en-tire Social-Democratic organisation. 
 Small as this almostexclusively student organisation may have been in compar-ison with our present-day party, its class-conscious, systema-tic, Social-Democratic intervention and leadership gave this movement tremendous scope and significance, as com-pared with the Morozov strike. 
 Again the government madeeconomic concessions. 
 A firm basis was achieved for a strikemovement throughout Russia. 
 The revolutionary intelli-gentsia turned Social-Democrat en masse . 
 The Social-Demo-cratic Party was founded. 
 1901—the workers came to the aid of the students. 
 A demonstration movement set in. 
 The proletariat carried its rallying call, “Down with theAutocracy!”, into the streets. 
 The radical intelligentsiadefinitely broke up into three parts—liberal, revolutionary-bourgeois, and Social-Democratic. 
 The participation of rev-olutionary Social-Democratic organisations in the demon-strations became more and more widespread, active, and direct. 
 1902—the huge Rostov strike developed into animpressive demonstration. 
 The political movement of theproletariat was no longer an adjunct of the movement of theintellectuals, of the students, but grew directly out of thestrike. 
 The participation of organised revolutionary Social-Democrats became still more active. 
 The proletariat won for itself and for the revolutionary Social-Democrats of itscommittee the right to hold mass meetings in the streets. 
For the first time the proletariat stood as a class against allother classes and against the tsarist government. 
 1903—again strikes merged with political demonstrations, but now on a still broader basis. 
 The strikes involved an entire district and more than a hundred thousand workers; ina number of cities political mass meetings were repeatedlyheld in the course of the strikes. 
 There was a feeling of beingon the eve of barricades (the opinion which the local Social-Democrats expressed on the movement in Kiev in 1903 57). 
 But the eve proved rather protracted, teaching us, as it were, that it takes powerful classes sometimes monthsand years to gather strength; putting, as it were, the scep-tical intellectual adherents of Social-Democracy to the test. 
And sure enough, the intellectualist wing of our Party, thenew-Iskrists or, what amounts to the same thing, the new-Rabocheye Dyelo -ists, have already begun to seek “higher types” of demonstrations, in the form of agreements betweenthe workers and the Zemstvo people not to create panic fear. 
 With the lack of principle characteristic of all opportunists, the new-Iskrists have now talked themselves into the pre-posterous, incredibly preposterous, thesis that in the polit-ical arena there are two (!) forces: the bureaucracy and thebourgeoisie (see the Iskra editors’ second letter in connection with the Zemstvo campaign). 
 The opportunists of the newIskra , these believers in carpe diem , have forgotten that the proletariat constitutes an independent force! Came the year 1905, and January 9 once again showed up all such backslid-ing types of the intelligentsia brood. 
 The proletarian move-ment at once rose to a higher plane. 
 The general strikerallied at least a million workers all over Russia. 
 The polit-ical demands of the Social-Democrats found their way evento the sections of the working class that still believed in the tsar. 
 The proletariat broke down the framework of the police-sponsored Zubatov movement, and virtually the entire mem-bership of the legal workers’ society founded for the pur-pose of combating the revolution took the path of revolutiontogether with Gapon. 
 Strikes and demonstrations began todevelop into an uprising before our very eyes. 
 The partici-pation of organised revolutionary Social-Democracy was incomparably more in evidence than in the previous stagesof the movement; yet it was still weak, weak in comparisonwith the overwhelming demand of the active proletarianmasses for Social-Democratic leadership. 
 Altogether, the two movements, strikes and demonstra-tions, combining in various forms and on various occasions, grew in breadth and in depth, became more and more revo-lutionary, came ever more closer in practice to the generalarmed uprising of the people, of which revolutionary Social-Democracy had long spoken. 
 We drew this conclusion fromthe events of January 9 in Nos. 
 4 * and 5 of Vperyod . 
 The St. 
 Petersburg workers drew this conclusion for themselves, forthwith and directly. 
 On January 10 they forced their wayinto a legal printing office, set up the following leaflet sentto us by the St. 
 Petersburg comrades, printed it in over10,000 copies, and distributed it throughout St. 
 Petersburg. 
The text of this remarkable leaflet follows.

 This appeal needs no comment. 
 The initiative of the revolutionary proletariat found full expression here. 
 The call of the St. 
 Petersburg workers was not answered as quick-ly as they wished; it will have to be repeated time andagain; the attempts to carry it out will more than onceresult in failure. 
 But the tremendous significance of the factthat the task has been set by the workers themselves is in-disputable. 
 The gain made by the revolutionary movement, which has brought about a realisation of the practical urgency of this task and made it an essential issue of everypopular movement, is a gain that nothing can now take awayfrom the proletariat. 
 It is worth dwelling on the history of the idea of insur-rection. 
 The new Iskra has given us so many nebulous platitudes on this question, beginning with the famousleader in issue No. 
 62, it has presented us with so many mud-dled opportunist ideas, entirely worthy of our old acquaint-ance Martynov, that the precise reproduction of the oldformulation of the question is of particular importance. 
 In any case, it is impossible to keep track of all the platitudes and muddled ideas of the new Iskra . 
 It is much wiser to have the old Iskra more often in mind and enlarge more concretely upon its old constructive slogans. 
 At the end of Lenin’s pamphlet What Is To Be Done? , on p. 
 136, * the slogan of a general armed uprising of the people was advanced. 
 The following was said on this subject at the very beginning of 1902, that is, three years ago: “Picture toyourselves a popular uprising. 
 Probably everyone will now agree that we must think of this uprising and prepare for it....

 A LETTER TO A. 
 A. 
 BOGDANOV AND S. 
 I. 
 GUSEV February 11, 1905 I wired my consent to your changes yesterday, although I emphatically do not agree with what I could gather from your letter. 
 But I am so sick of this procrastination, andyour questions seemed such a mockery, that I just gave it up, thinking, if only they did something! If only they gave notice of the Congress, any kind of notice , so long as they gave it, instead of just talking about it. 
 You will be surprised at my use of the word mockery. 
 But just stop andthink: two months ago I sent my draft to all members of the Bureau. 
 * Not one of them is interested in it or finds it neces-sary to discuss it. 
 And now—by wire.... 
 A nice business:we talk of organisation, of centralism, while actually thereis such disunity, such amateurism among even the closest comrades in the centre, that one feels like chucking it all in disgust. 
 Just look at the Bundists: they do not prate aboutcentralism, but every one of them writes to the centre weekly and contact is thus actually maintained. 
 You only have to pick up their Posledniye Izvestia ** to see this contact. 
 We, however, here are issuing the sixth number of Vperyod , yet one of our editors (Rakhmetov) has not written a single line,either about or for Vperyod . 
 Our people “talk” of extensive literary connections in St. 
 Petersburg and in Moscow, and of the Majority’s young forces, while we here, two months after the issuance of the call for collaboration (the announce-ment of Vperyod and a letter in connection with it), have seen or heard nothing from them.

 (Caucasus, Nizhni-Novgorod, not to speak of the Volga region or the South) consider the Bureau a “myth”, and with perfect justification. 
 We did “hear” from strangers about some sort of alliance between the St. 
 Petersburg Committeeof the Majority and a group of Mensheviks, but from ourown people not a word. 
 We refuse to believe that Bolshevikscould have taken such an imbecilic, suicidal step. 
 We did“hear” from strangers about a conference of Social-Democrats and the formation of a “bloc”, but from our own people not a word , although there are rumours that this is a fait accompli . 
 Evidently, the members of the Majority are anxious to be imposed upon again. 
 Our only strength lies in utter frankness, in solidarity, and in determined assault. 
 But people, it seems, have gone soft now that we have a “revolution”! At a time when or-ganisation is needed a hundred times more than ever beforethey sell out to the disrupters. 
 It is evident from the pro-posed changes in the draft of the declaration and Con-gress call (set forth in the letter so vaguely as to be almostunintelligible) that “loyalty” has been put on a pedestal. 
 Papasha * actually uses that word, adding that if the centres are not mentioned, no one will come to the Congress! Well,gentlemen, I can wager that if t h i s is the way you are going to act, you will never have a congress and never escape fromunder the thumb of the Bonapartists of the Central Organ andthe Central Committee. 
 To call a congress against the cen-tral bodies, in which lack of confidence has been expressed, to call this Congress in the name of a revolutionary bureau (which, if we are to pay slavish obeisance to the loyal PartyRules, is non-existent and fictitious), and to recognise theunqualified right of the nine Bonapartists, the League (ha! ha!), and the Bonapartist creatures (the freshly hatched committees) to attend that Congress, means to make our-selves ridiculous and to lose all right to respect. 
 The centresmay and should be invited, but to accord them voting statusis, I repeat, madness. 
 The centres, of course, will not come toour Congress anyway; but why give them another chance to spit in our faces? Why this hypocrisy, this game of hide-and-seek? It is a positive shame! We bring the split into the open, *See Note 22. 
— Ed. 
 we call the Vperyod -ists to a congress, we want to organise a Vperyod -ist party, and we break immediately any and all connections with the disorganisers—and yet we are having loyalty dinned into our ears, we are asked to act as thougha joint congress of Iskra and Vperyod were possible. 
 What a farce! The very first day, the very first hour of the Congress(if it does take place) will beyond doubt ring down the cur-tain on this farce; but until the Congress meets such deceit can do us untold harm. 
 Really, I sometimes think that nine-tenths of the Bol-sheviks are actually formalists. 
 Either we shall rally all whoare out to fight into a really iron-strong organisation andwith this small but strong party quash that sprawling mon-ster, the new-Iskra motley elements, or we shall prove by our conduct that we deserve to go under for being contempt-ible formalists. 
 How is it that people do not understand thatprior to the Bureau and prior to “Vperyod ” we did all we could to save loyalty, to save unity, to save the formal,i. 
e. 
, higher methods of settling the conflict?! But now,after the Bureau, after “Vperyod ”, the split is a fact. 
 And when the split had become a fact it became evident that materially we were very much weaker . 
 We have yet to convert our moral strength into material strength. 
 The Menshevikshave more money, more literature, more transportationfacilities, more agents, more “names”, and a larger staff ofcontributors. 
 It would be unpardonable childishness not to see that. 
 And if we do not wish to present to the world the repulsive spectacle of a dried-up and anaemic old maid,proud of her barren moral purity, then we must understandthat we need war and a battle organisation. 
 Only after along battle, and only with the aid of an excellent organisa-tion can we turn our moral strength into material strength. 
 We need funds. 
 The plan to hold the Congress i n L o n -d o n is sublimely ridiculous, for it would cost twice as much. 
 We cannot suspend publication of Vperyod , which is what a long absence would mean. 
 The Congress must be a simpleaffair, brief, and small in attendance. 
 This is a congress forthe organisation of the battle. 
 Clearly, you are cherishing illusions in this respect. 
 We need people to work on Vperyod . 
 There are not enough of us. 
 If we do not get two or three extra people from Russia as permanent contributors, there is no sense in continuing to prate about a struggle against Iskra . 
 Pamphlets and leaflets are needed, and needed desperately. 
 We need young forces. 
 I am for shooting on the spot any-one who presumes to say that there are no people to be had. 
The people in Russia are legion; all we have to do is torecruit young people more widely and boldly, more boldlyand widely, and again more widely and again more boldly, without fearing them . 
 This is a time of war. 
 The youth—the students, and still more so the young workers—will decide theissue of the whole struggle. 
 Get rid of all the old habits ofimmobility, of respect for rank, and so on. 
 Form h u n d r e d s of circles of Vperyod -ists from among the youth and encour-age them to work at full blast. 
 Enlarge the Committee threefold by accepting young people into it, set up half a dozen or a dozen subcommittees, “co-opt” any and everyhonest and energetic person. 
 Allow every subcommittee towrite and publish leaflets without any red tape (there is noharm if they do make a mistake; we on Vperyod will “gently” correct them). 
 We must, with desperate speed, unite all people with revolutionary initiative and set them to work. 
 Do not fear their lack of training, do not tremble at theirinexperience and lack of development. 
 In the first place,if you fail to organise them and spur them on to action,they will follow the Mensheviks and the Gapons, and thisvery inexperience of theirs will cause five times more harm. 
 In the second place, events themselves will teach them in our spirit . 
 Events are already teaching everyone precisely in the Vperyod spirit. 
 Only you must be sure to organise, organise, and organ-ise hundreds of circles, completely pushing into the back-ground the customary, well-meant committee (hierarchic) stupidities. 
 This is a time of war. 
 Either you create n e w , young, fresh, energetic battle organisations everywhere forrevolutionary Social-Democratic work of all varieties amongall strata, or you will go under, wearing the aureole of “com-mittee” bureaucrats. 
 I shall write of this in Vperyod * and speak of it at the Congress. 
 I am writing to you in one more endeavour to evoke *See pp. 
 211-20 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 an exchange of ideas, to call upon you to bring a dozen y o u n g , f r e s h workers’ (and other) circles into direct con-tact with the Editorial Board, although ... although between ourselves be it said, I do not cherish the slightest hope thatthese daring ideas will be fulfilled, unless, perhaps, twomonths from now you will ask me to wire whether I agreeto such-and-such changes in the “plan”.... 
 I reply in advancethat I agree to everything.

 You must make it your aim to revolutionise the delivery of Vperyod into Russia. 
 Carry on widespread propa-ganda for subscriptions from St. 
 Petersburg. 
 Let students and especially workers subscribe for scores and hundreds of copies to be sent to their own addresses. 
 It is absurd to have fearson this score in times like these. 
 The police can never inter-cept all the copies. 
 Half the number or a third will arrive,and that amounts to very much. 
 Suggest this idea to any youth circle, and it will find hundreds of ways of its own to make connections abroad. 
 Distribute addresses more widely, as widely as possible, for the transmission of letters toVperyod .

 4 (39) TWO TACTICS From the very beginning of the mass working-class move-ment in Russia, i. 
e. 
, approximately for the past ten years,profound differences have existed among Social-Democrats on questions of tactics. 
 As we know, it was differences of this kind that gave rise, in the late nineties, to the trend of Econ-omism, which led to the split into an opportunist ( Rabo-cheye Dyelo ) wing and into a revolutionary (old-Iskra ) wing of the Party. 
 Russian Social-Democratic opportunism,however, differed from that of Western Europe in certain peculiar features. 
 It strikingly reflected the point of view, or rather the absence of any independent point of view, ofthe intellectualist wing of the Party, which was carried awayboth by the current catchwords of Bernsteinism and by theforms and immediate results of the pure-and-simple labourmovement. 
 This infatuation led to wholesale treachery on the part of the legal Marxists, who went over to liberalism, and to the creation by Social-Democrats of the famous “tac-tics-as-process” theory, which firmly attached to our oppor-tunists the label of “tail-enders”. 
 They trailed helplessly be-hind events, plunged from one extreme to another, and in allcases reduced the scope of activity of the revolutionary pro-letariat and its faith in its own strength, all of which was usually done on the pretext of raising the independent activ-ity of the proletariat. 
 Strange, but true. 
 No one talked somuch about the independent activity of the workers, and noone did so much by his propaganda to narrow, curtail, anddiminish that activity as did the Rabocheye Dyelo -ists. 
 “Talk less about ‘raising the activity of the working masses’,” the class-conscious, advanced workers said to theirzealous but misguided advisers. 
 “We are far more active than you think, and we are quite able to support, by open street fighting, even demands that do not promise any ‘tangible results ’ whatever. 
 It is not for you to ‘raise’ our activity, because activity is precisely the thing you yourselves lack. 
Bow less in subservience to spontaneity, and think moreabout raising your own activity, gentlemen!” This is howthe attitude of the revolutionary workers towards the oppor-tunist intellectuals had to be characterised. 
 ( What Is To Be Done? , p. 
 55. 
 *) The two steps back which the new Iskra took towards Rabocheye Dyelo revived this attitude. 
 Once again the col-umns of Iskra pour forth the preachings of tail-ism under cover of the same nauseating vows: Verily, O Lord, I doprofess and believe in the independent activity of the pro-letariat. 
 It was in the name of the independent activity of the proletariat that Axelrod, Martynov, Martov, and Lieber(the Bundist) defended at the Congress the right of professorsand students to become members of the Party without join-ing any Party organisation. 
 It was in the name of the in-dependent activity of the proletariat that the “organisation-as-process” theory was invented, a theory that justified disorganisation and glorified the anarchism of the intellec-tuals. 
 It was in the name of the independent activity of theproletariat that the no less famous “higher-type-of-demonstra-tion” theory was invented, in the form of an agreement be-tween a workers’ delegation, which had been passed through the sieve of a three-stage system of elections, and the Zem-stvo men for a peaceful demonstration that was to create no panic fear. 
 It was in the name of the independent activityof the proletariat that the idea of the armed uprising wasperverted and vulgarised, debased and confused. 
 In view of its vast practical importance, we should like to draw the reader’s attention to this question. 
 The develop-ment of the working-class movement played a cruel joke onthe wise men of the new Iskra . 
 They circulated a letter in Russia, which, in the name of “the process of the systematicdevelopment of the class-consciousness and independentactivity of the proletariat”, recommended, as a higher type of demonstration, “that the workers’ petitions be posted to the *See present edition, Vol. 
 5, p. 
 417. 
— Ed. 
 homes of the municipal councillors and a considerable num-ber of copies scattered in the Zemstvo Assembly Hall”; they sent a second letter to Russia, conveying the most sensational discovery that at the present “historical moment the politicalstage is fully occupied [!] by the conflict between theorganised bourgeoisie and the bureaucracy” and that “every[mark well!] revolutionary movement of the lower stratahas only one [!] objective meaning, to support the slogans of that one of the two [!!] forces which is interested in break-ing down the present regime” (the democratic intelligentsiawas declared to be “a force”); hardly had the first letter beencirculated and the second letter reached Russia, hardly hadthe class-conscious workers had time to read these marvel-lous missives and to have a good laugh at them, when the events of the real struggle of the proletariat promptly swept all this political rubbish of the new-Iskra publicists on to the waste heap. 
 The proletariat showed that there is a thirdforce (actually, of course, not third, but, in sequence, second and in fighting ability first), which is not merely inter-ested in breaking down the autocratic regime, but is ready to start on the actual job of breaking it down . 
 Since the Ninth of January, the working-class movement has been developing before our very eyes into the popular uprising. 
 Let us see how this transition to the uprising was evaluat-ed by the Social-Democrats, who had discussed it in advanceas a question of tactics, and how the workers themselves began to settle this question in practice. 
 Three-years ago the following was said on insurrection as a slogan that defines our immediate, practical tasks:“Picture to yourselves a popular uprising. 
 Probably every-one will now agree that we must think of this uprising andprepare for it. 
 But how? Surely the Central Committee can-not appoint agents to all localities for the purpose of prepar-ing the uprising! Even if we had a Central Committee,it could achieve absolutely nothing by such appointmentsunder present-day Russian conditions. 
 But a network ofagents that would form in the course of establishing anddistributing the common newspaper would not have to ‘sit about and wait’ for the call to insurrection, but could carry on such regular activity as would guarantee the highest pro-bability of success in the event of an insurrection. 
 Such activ-ity would strengthen our connections with the broadest masses of the workers and with all strata that are discontent-ed with the autocracy, which is of such importance for an uprising. 
 Precisely such activity would serve to cultivatethe ability to estimate correctly the general political situa-tion and, consequently, the ability to select the propermoment for the uprising. 
 Precisely such activity would trainall local organisations to respond simultaneously to the same political questions, incidents, and events that agitate the whole of Russia and to react to these ‘incidents’ in the mostvigorous, uniform, and expedient manner possible; for the up-rising is in essence the most vigorous, most uniform, and mostexpedient ‘answer’ of the entire people to the government. 
And lastly, it is precisely such activity that would train all revolutionary organisations throughout Russia to maintain the most continuous, and at the same time the most secret,contacts with one another, thus creating real Party unity; for without such contacts it will be impossible collectivelyto discuss the plan for the uprising and to take the necessarypreparatory measures on the eve, measures that must be kept in the strictest secrecy. 
 “In a word, the ‘plan for an all-Russian political news-paper’, far from representing the fruits of the labour of arm-chair workers, infected with dogmatism and bookishness(as it seemed to those who gave but little thought to it),is the most practical plan for immediate and all-round prep-aration of the uprising , with , at the same time , no loss of sight for a moment of the pressing day-to-day work . 
” (What Is To Be Done? *) The concluding words, which we have underlined, give a clear answer to the question how the revolutionary Social-Democrats envisaged the work of preparing the uprising. 
 But clear as this answer is, the old tail-ist tactics could not fail to assert themselves on this point also. 
 Quite recentlyMartynov published a pamphlet entitled Two Dictatorships , which has been strongly recommended by the new Iskra (No. 
 84). 
 The author is stirred to the depths of his Rabo-cheye Dyelo soul with indignation at the fact that Lenin could bring himself to speak of “preparing, timing , and *See present edition, Vol. 
 5, p. 
 516. 
— Ed. 
 carrying out the general armed uprising of the people”. 
 The stern Martynov smites the enemy with the statement: “On the basis of historical experience and a scientific analy-sis of the dynamics of social forces, international Social-Democracy has always recognised that only palace revo-lutions and pronunciamentos can be timed in advance and carried out successfully according to a previously preparedplan, for the very reason that they are not popular revolu-tions, i. 
e. 
, revolutions in social relations, but only reshuf-flings among the ruling cliques. 
 Social-Democracy has alwaysand everywhere recognised that a people’s revolution cannotbe timed in advance, that it is not prepared artificially, but that it comes about of itself. 
” Perhaps, having read this tirade, the reader will say that obviously Martynov is “anything but” a serious opponent and that it would be absurd to take him seriously. 
 We wouldquite agree with the reader. 
 We would even say to such a read-er that no greater evil on earth could befall us than to haveto take all the theories and all the arguments of our new-Iskra people seriously. 
 The only trouble is that this nonsense appears also in the editorials of Iskra (No. 
 62). 
 Worse still, there are people in the Party, by no means few, who stufftheir heads with this nonsense. 
 And so we have to discussnon-serious matters, just as we have to discuss the “theory”of Rosa Luxemburg, who discovered the “organisation-as-process”. 
 We are obliged to explain to Martynov that uprising must not be confused with people’s revolution. 
 We have to keep explaining that profound allusions to a revo-lution in social relations when what is at issue is the practi-cal question of the ways of overthrowing Russian autocracyare worthy only of a Kifa Mokiyevich. 
 58 This revolution began in Russia with the abolition of serfdom, and it is the backwardness of our political superstructure as compared with the accomplished revolution in social relations thatmakes the collapse of the superstructure inevitable; an imme-diate collapse as the result of a single blow is quite possible, since “the people’s revolution” in Russia has already dealttsarism a hundred blows, and whether the hundred and first or the hundred and tenth will finish it off is really a matter of conjecture. 
 Only opportunist intellectuals, who try toimpute their own philistine ways to the proletarians, can flaunt their high school knowledge of a “revolution in social relations” at a time when practical ways are being discussed for delivering one of the blows in the second hundred. 
 Only the opportunists of the new Iskra can raise hysterical clam-ours about a sinister “Jacobin” plan, the keynote of which,as we have seen, is all-round mass agitation by means of apolitical newspaper. 
 A people’s revolution, true, cannot be timed. 
 We cannot but praise Martynov and the writer of the leader in Iskra , No. 
 62, for knowing this truth (“what thought of preparingthe uprising can there possibly be in our Party?” askedMartynov’s loyal associate, or disciple, in that article,warring on the “utopians”). 
 But if we have really prepared anuprising, and if a popular uprising is realisable by virtue of the revolutions in social relations that have already taken place , then it is quite possible to time the uprising. 
 We shall attempt to clarify the point for the new-Iskra followers by a simple example. 
 Can the working-class move-ment be timed? No, it cannot; for that movement is madeup of thousands of separate acts arising from a revolution in social relations. 
 Can a strike be timed? It can, despite the fact—just imagine, Comrade Martynov— despite the fact that every strike is the result of a revolution in socialrelations. 
 When can a strike be timed? When the organisa-tion or group calling it has influence among the masses of the workers involved and is able correctly to gauge the moment when discontent and resentment among them are mounting. 
 Do you see the point now, Comrade Martynovand Comrade “leader-ist” of Iskra , No. 
 62? If you do, then please take the trouble to compare an uprising with a people’srevolution. 
 “A people’s revolution cannot be timed in ad-vance. 
” An uprising can be, if those preparing it have influence among the masses and can correctly estimate the situation. 
 Fortunately, the initiative of the advanced workers happens to be far ahead of the tail-ist philosophy of the newIskra . 
 While the latter is squeezing itself dry for theories to prove that an uprising cannot be timed by those who haveprepared for it and have organised the vanguard of the rev-olutionary class, events show that those who have not pre-pared may time, indeed, are sometimes compelled to time,an uprising. 
 Here is a leaflet sent to us by a St. 
 Petersburg comrade. 
 It was set up, printed, and distributed in more that 10,000 copies by the workers themselves, who had seized a legal printing-press in St. 
 Petersburg on January 10. 
 “Workers of All Countries, Unite!“Citizens ! Yesterday you witnessed the brutality of the autocratic government. 
 You saw blood flowing in the streets. 
You saw hundreds of fighters for the working-class cause lying dead; you saw death, you heard the groans of wounded women and defenceless children. 
 The blood and brains ofworkers bespattered the roadways that workers’ hands hadlaid. 
 Who directed the troops, the rifles, and the bulletsagainst the workers’ breasts? “The tsar, the grand dukes, the Ministers, the generals, and the scoundrels at Court. 
 “They are the murderers! Death to them! To arms , com-rades , seize the arsenals, the munitions depots, and ar-mourers’ shops. 
 Break down the prison walls, comrades, andrelease the fighters for freedom. 
 Smash up the gendarmeand police stations and all government institutions. 
 Let us overthrow the tsarist government and establish our own. 
 Long live the revolution! Long live the Constituent Assembly of People’s Representatives! “Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party . 
” The call to insurrection issued by this handful of ad-vanced enterprising workers did not meet with success. 
 Several unsuccessful calls to insurrection, or several unsuc-cessful “timings” of insurrection would not surprise or discour-age us. 
 We leave it to the new Iskra to hold forth in this con-nection on the necessity of a “revolution in social relations”and grandiloquently to condemn the “utopianism” of the workers who exclaimed, “Let us establish our own govern-ment!” Only hopeless pedants or muddle-heads would re-gard this watchword as the central point of such an appeal. 
What is important for us to note and emphasise is the remark-ably bold and practical manner in which the problem nowsquarely confronting us was posed. 
 The call of the St. 
 Petersburg workers was not answered and could not have been answered as quickly as they wished. 
This call will be repeated time and again, and the attemptsat an uprising may result in more failures. 
 But the very fact that the workers themselves have raised this issue is of tre-mendous significance. 
 The gain which the working-class move-ment has made in bringing home the practical urgency of this problem and in moving it closer to the forefront of anypopular unrest is a gain that nothing can take away from theproletariat. 
 As much as three years ago the Social-Democrats had on general grounds advanced the slogan of preparing the uprising. 
 The independent activity of the proletariat arrived at the same slogan as a result of the direct lessons taught bythe civil war. 
 There are two kinds of independent activity. 
There is the independent activity of a proletariat possessedof revolutionary initiative, and there is the independentactivity of a proletariat that is undeveloped and is held in leading-strings; there is a consciously Social-Democratic independent activity, and there is a Zubatovist independentactivity. 
 And there are Social-Democrats who to this daycontemplate with reverence the second kind of independentactivity, who believe that they can evade a direct replyto the pressing questions of the day by repeating the word “class” over and over again. 
 We need but take No. 
 84 of Iskra . 
 “Why,” asks its “leader-ist”, bearing down on us with a trium-phant air, “why was it not the narrow organisation of pro-fessional revolutionaries, but the Workers’ Assembly thatset this avalanche in motion [January 9]? Because this Assembly was a really [mark this!] broad organisation based on the independent activity of the working-class masses . 
” If the author of this classical phrase were not an admirer ofMartynov, he might have understood that the Assemblyrendered a service to the movement of the revolutionary pro-letariat only when and to the extent that it passed fromZubatovist independent activity to Social-Democratic in-dependent activity (after which it immediately ceased to exist as a legally functioning organisation). 
 Had the new-Iskrists, or the new-Rabocheye Dyelo -ists not been tail-enders, they would have realised that it wasthe Ninth of January that justified those who had said that“...in the long run the legalisation of the working-class move-ment will be to our advantage, and not to that of the Zu-batovs” ( What Is To Be Done? *). 
 It was the Ninth of January *See present edition, Vol. 
 5, p. 
 455. 
— Ed. 
 that proved again and again the importance of the task for-mulated in that pamphlet: “...we must prepare reapers, both to cut down the tares of today [paralyse today’s corrupting influence of the Zubatov movement] and to reap the wheat of tomorrow ” (give a revolutionary lead to the movement that has advanced a step with the aid of legalisation). 
The Simple Simons of the new Iskra , however, use the boun-tiful wheat harvest as a pretext for minimising the impor-tance of a strong organisation of revolutionary reapers. 
 Like the Bundists, they fuss over the catchphrase “independentactivity of the workers” as a child with a new toy. 
 It would be criminal, the new-Iskra leader-writer contin-ues, “to attack the revolution in the rear”. 
 What this sen-tence means, God only knows. 
 As to its bearing on the general opportunist complexion of Iskra , we shall probably deal with the point on another occasion. 
 Here it will suffice toindicate that this sentence can have but one true politicalmeaning, namely, that the author grovels in the dust be-fore the rear of the revolution and disdainfully turns up hisnose at the “narrow” and “Jacobin” van of the revolution. 
 The more the new Iskra displays its Martynovist zeal, the clearer becomes the contrast between the tactics of tail-ism and the tactics of revolutionary Social-Democracy. 
We pointed out in the first issue of Vperyod * that an up-rising must connect itself with one of the spontaneous move-ments. 
 Consequently, we do not in the least forget the im-portance of “guarding the rear”, to employ a military term. 
 In Vperyod , No. 
 4, ** we referred to the correct tactics of the St. 
 Petersburg Committee members, who from the outsetdirected all their efforts towards supporting and developingthe revolutionary elements in the spontaneous movement,while at the same time maintaining an attitude of reserve and distrust towards the shady, Zubatov rear of that move-ment. 
 We shall conclude now with a piece of advice, whichno doubt we shall have to repeat more than once to thenew-Iskrists: Do not minimise the tasks of the revolution’svanguard, do not forget our obligation to support this van-guard by our organised independent activity.

 Vperyod , No. 
 6, Published according to February 14 (1), 1905 the text in Vperyod A MILITANT AGREEMENT FOR THE UPRISING Revolutsionnaya Rossiya , No. 
 58, says: “May the spirit of fighting unity now at long last pervade the ranks of therevolutionary socialist groups, which are torn by fratricidal animosity, and may it revive the consciousness of socialist solidarity which has been so criminally sapped.... 
 Let usspare the revolutionary forces as much as we can and increasetheir effectiveness by means of a concerted attack!” We have often had occasion to protest against the tyr-anny of the phrase among the Socialists-Revolutionaries, and we must do so again. 
 Why these frightful words, gentle-men, about “fratricidal animosity” and so forth? Are theyworthy of a revolutionary? Now of all times, when the realfight is on, when blood is flowing—the blood of whichRevolutsionnaya Rossiya speaks in such flamboyant terms, these grotesque exaggerations about “fratricidal animosity” ring falser than ever. 
 Spare the forces, say you? But surely this is done by a united, welded organisation which is atone on questions of principle, and not by lumping togetherheterogeneous elements. 
 Strength is not spared but wastedby such barren attempts at lumping. 
 To achieve a “fightingunity in deed and not merely in word, we must know clear-ly, definitely, and from experience exactly wherein and to what extent we can be united. 
 Without this, all talk of fighting unity will be mere words, words, words; this knowl-edge, incidentally, comes from the very controversy, strug-gle, and animosity of which you speak in such “frightful”terms. 
 Would it really be better if we hushed up the differ-ences that divide vast sections of Russian public opinion and Russian socialist thought? Was it only the “cult of dis-cord” that provoked the bitter struggle between Narodism, that nebulous ideology of the democratic bourgeoisie woven of socialistic dreams, and Marxism, the ideology of the proletariat? Nonsense, gentlemen; you only make your-selves ridiculous by saying such things, by continuing toregard as an “insult” the Marxist view that Narodism andyour “social-revolutionism” are essentially bourgeois-dem-ocratic. 
 We shall inevitably argue, differ, and quarrel alsoin the future revolutionary committees in Russia, but surely we must learn from history. 
 We must not have unex-pected, unintelligible, and muddled disputes at a time whenaction is called for; we must be prepared to argue on funda-mental issues, to know the points of departure of eachtrend, to anticipate possible unity or possible antagonism. 
The history of revolutionary epochs provides many, all too many, instances of tremendous harm caused by hasty and half-baked experiments in “fighting unity” that sought tolump together the most heterogeneous elements in thecommittees of the revolutionary people, but managed therebyto achieve mutual friction and bitter disappointment . 
 We want to profit by this lesson of history. 
 Marxism, which to you seems a narrow dogma, is to us the quintessence of this historical lesson and guidance. 
 We see in the inde-pendent , uncompromisingly Marxist party of the revolution-ary proletariat the sole pledge of socialism’s victory andthe road to victory that is most free from vacillations. 
 Weshall never, therefore, not even at the most revolutionary moments, forego the complete independence of the Social-Democratic Party or the complete intransigence of ourideology. 
 You believe this rules out fighting unity? You are mis-taken. 
 You can see from the resolution of our Second Con-gress that we do not renounce agreements for the struggle and in the struggle. 
 In Vperyod , No. 
 4, we stressed the fact that the beginning of the revolution in Russia undoubtedlybrings closer the moment when such agreements can be prac-tically implemented. 
 * A joint struggle of the revolutionary Social-Democrats and the revolutionary elements of the dem-ocratic movement is inevitable and indispensable in the era of the fall of the autocracy. 
 We think that we should serve *See pp. 
 99-100 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 the cause of future militant agreements better if, instead of indulging in bitter recriminations, we sanely and coolly weighed the conditions under which they would become possible and the likely limits of their “jurisdiction”, if one may use the term. 
 We began this work in Vperyod , No. 
 3, in which we undertook a study of the progress of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party from Narodism to Marxism. 
 * “The masses took to arms themselves,” Revolutsionnaya Rossiya wrote in connection with the Ninth of January. 
 “Sooner or later, without doubt, the question of arming themasses will be decided. 
” “That is when the fusion between terrorism and the mass movement, to which we are striving by word and deed in accordance with the entire spirit of our Party tactics, will be manifested and realised in the most striking manner. 
” (We would remark parenthetically that we would gladly put a question mark after the word “deed”; but let us proceed with the quotation. 
) “Not so long ago, before our own eyes, these two factors of the movement were separate, and this separateness deprived them of their full force. 
” What is true is true! Exactly! Intelligentsia terrorism and the mass movement of the working class were separate , and this separateness deprived them of their full force . 
 That is precisely what the revolutionary Social-Democrats havebeen saying all along. 
 For this very reason they have always been opposed to terrorism and to all the vacillations towards terrorism which members of the intellectualist wing of our Party have often displayed. 
 ** For this reason precisely the old Iskra took a position against terrorism when it wrote in issue No. 
 48: “The terrorist struggle of the old type was the riskiest form of revolutionary struggle, and those whoengaged in it had the reputation of being resolute, self-sacri-ficing people.... 
 Now, however, when demonstrations develop into acts of open resistance to the government, ... the old terrorism ceases to be an exceptionally daring method of struggle....

 The new-Iskrists generally in a leaflet in connection with the assassination of Plehve. 
 59 true heroes of our time are now the revolutionaries who lead the popular masses, which are rising against their oppressors.... 
 The terrorism of the great French Revolu-tion ... began on July 14, 1789, with the storming of the Bastille. 
 Its strength was the strength of the revolutionary movement of the people.... 
 That terrorism was due, not to disappointment in the strength of the mass movement, but, on the contrary, to unshakable faith in its strength.... 
 The history of that terrorism is exceedingly instructive for the Russian revolutionary. 
” * Yes, a thousand times yes! The history of that terror-ism is instructive in the extreme. 
 Instructive, too, are the quoted passages from Iskra , which refer to an epoch of eighteen months ago. 
 These quotations show us, in their full stature, the ideas which even the Socialists-Revolution-aries, under the influence of the revolutionary lessons, would like to arrive at. 
 They remind us of the importance of faith in the mass movement; they remind us of revolutionary tenacity, which comes only from high principles and which alone can safeguard us against the “disappointments” induced by a prolonged apparent standstill of the movement. 
 Now, after the Ninth of January, there can be no question, on the face of it, of any “disappointments” in the mass move-ment. 
 But only on the face of it. 
 We should distinguish be-tween the momentary “attraction” evoked by a striking dis-play of mass heroism and the steadfast, reasoned convic-tions that link inseparably the entire activity of the Party with the movement of the masses, owing to the paramount importance which is attached to the principle of the class struggle. 
 We should bear in mind that the revolutionary movement, however high its level since the Ninth of January, still has many stages to pass through before our socialist and democratic parties will be reconstructed on a new basis in a free Russia. 
 And through all these stages, through all the vicissitudes of the struggle, we must maintain the ties be-tween Social-Democracy and the class struggle of the prole-*This article in Iskra , written by Plekhanov, dates back to the time when Iskra (Nos. 
 46-51) was edited by Plekhanov and Lenin. 
 Plekhanov had at that time not begun to contemplate the new line ofnotorious compliance to opportunism. 
 tariat unbroken, and we must see to it that they are contin-uously strengthened and made more secure. 
 It seems to us, therefore, a gross exaggeration for Revo-lutsionnaya Rossiya to assert that “the pioneers of the armed struggle were swallowed up in the ranks of the rousedmasses”.... 
 “This is the desirable future rather than the reali-ty of the moment. 
 The assassination of Sergei in Moscow onFebruary 17 (4), 60 which has been reported by telegraph this very day, is obviously an act of terrorism of the old type. 
 The pioneers of the armed struggle have not yet been swallowed up in the ranks of the roused masses. 
 Pioneerswith bombs evidently lay in wait for Sergei in Moscow whilethe masses (in St. 
 Petersburg), without pioneers, withoutarms, without revolutionary officers, and without a revolu-tionary staff “flung themselves in implacable fury upon bris-tling bayonets”, as this same Revolutsionnaya Rossiya expresses it. 
 The separateness of which we spoke abovestill exists , and the individual intellectualist terror shows all the more strikingly its inadequacy in face of the growingrealisation that “the masses have risen to the stature of individual heroes, that mass heroism has been awakened in them” ( Revolutsionnaya Rossiya , No. 
 58). 
 The pioneers should submerge among the masses in actual fact , that is, exert their selfless energies in real inseparable connectionwith the insurgent masses, and proceed with them in the lit-eral, not figurative, symbolical, sense of the word. 
 That this is essential can hardly be open to doubt now. 
 That it is pos-sible has been proved by the Ninth of January and by thedeep unrest which is still smouldering among the working-class masses. 
 The fact that this is a new, higher, and moredifficult task in comparison with the preceding ones cannotand should not stop us from meeting it at once in a practi-cal way. 
 Fighting unity between the Social-Democratic Party and the revolutionary-democratic party—the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, might be one way of facilitating thesolution of this problem. 
 Such unity will be all the morepracticable, the sooner the pioneers of the armed struggle are “swallowed up” in the ranks of the insurgent masses, the more firmly the Socialists-Revolutionaries follow the pathwhich they themselves have charted in the words, “May these beginnings of fusion between revolutionary terrorism and the mass movement grow and strengthen, may the masses act as quickly as possible, armed cap-à-pie with terror-ist methods of struggle!” With a view to bringing aboutspeedily such a fighting unity, we take pleasure in publishingthe following letter which we have received from GeorgiGapon: “An Open Letter to the Socialist Parties of Russia. 
 “The bloody January days in St. 
 Petersburg and the rest of Russia have brought the oppressed working class face to face with the auto-cratic regime, headed by the blood-thirsty tsar. 
 The great Russian re-volution has begun. 
 All to whom the people’s freedom is really dearmust either win or die. 
 Realising the importance of the present historicmoment, considering the present state of affairs, and being above all a revolutionary and a man of action, I call upon all the socialist parties of Russia to enter immediately into an agreement among them-selves and to proceed to the armed uprising against tsarism. 
 All theforces of every party should be mobilised. 
 All should have a single tech-nical plan of action. 
 Bombs and dynamite, individual and mass terror—everything that can help the popular uprising. 
 The immediate aim is the overthrow of the autocracy, a provisional revolutionary govern-ment which will at once amnesty all fighters for political and religiousliberties, at once arm the people and at once convoke a ConstituentAssembly on the basis of universal, equal, and direct suffrage by secretballot. 
 To the task, comrades! Onward to the fight! Let us retreat theslogan of the St. 
 Petersburg workers on the Ninth of January—Freedom or Death! Delay and disorder now are a crime against the people, whose interests you are defending. 
 Having given all of myself to the serviceof the people, from whom I myself am sprung (the son of a peasant),and having thrown in my lot irrevocably with the struggle against theoppressors and exploiters of the working class, I shall naturally be heartand soul with those who will undertake the real business of actually liberating the proletariat and all the toiling masses from the capitalist yoke and political slavery. 
 “Georgi Gapon. 
” On our part, we consider it necessary to state our view of this letter as clearly and as definitely as possible. 
 We consider that the “agreement” it proposes is possible, useful,and essential. 
 We welcome the fact that Gapon speaksexplicitly of an “agreement”, since only through the preser-vation of complete independence by each separate partyon points of principle and organisation can the efforts at a fighting unity of these parties rest on hope. 
 We must be very careful, in making these endeavours, not to spoil thingsby vainly trying to lump together heterogeneous elements. 
 We shall inevitably have to getrennt marschieren (march separately), but we can veretnt schlagen (strike together) more than once and particularly now. 
 It would be desirable, from our point of view, to have this agreement embrace therevolutionary as well as the socialist parties, for there is nothing socialistic in the immediate aim of the struggle,and we must not confound or allow anyone ever to confoundthe immediate democratic aims with our ultimate aims of socialist revolution. 
 It would be desirable, and from our point of view essential , for the agreement that, instead of a general call for “ individual and mass terror”, it should be stated openly and definitely that this joint action pursuesthe aim of a direct and actual fusion between terrorism and the uprising of the masses. 
 True, by adding the words “ev-erything that can help the popular uprising”, Gapon clearly indicates his desire to make even individual terror subser-vient to this aim; but this desire, which suggests the ideathat we noted in Revolutsionnaya Rossiya , No. 
 58, should be expressed more definitely and embodied in absolutelyunequivocal practical decisions. 
 We should like, finally, to point out, regardless of the realisability of the proposed agreement, that Gapon’s extra-party stand seems to us tobe another negative factor. 
 Obviously, with so rapid aconversion from faith in the tsar and petitioning of the tsarto revolutionary aims, Gapon was not able to evolve forhimself immediately a clear revolutionary outlook. 
 This is inevitable, and the faster and broader the revolution develops, the more often will this kind of thing occur. 
 Never-theless, complete clarity and definiteness in the relationsbetween parties, trends, and shades are absolutely neces-sary if a temporary agreement among them is to be in anyway successful. 
 Clarity and definiteness will be needed at every practical step; they will be the pre-condition for definiteness and the absence of vacillation in the real, prac-tical work. 
 The beginning of the revolution in Russia will probably lead to the emergence upon the political arena ofmany people and perhaps trends representing the view thatthe slogan “revolution” is, for “men of action”, a quite ade-quate definition of their aims and their methods of opera-tion. 
 Nothing could be more fallacious than this opinion. 
The extra-party position, which seems higher, or more con-venient, or more “diplomatic”, is in actual fact more vague , more obscure, and inevitably fraught with inconsistencies and vacillations in practical activity. 
 In the interests of the revolution our ideal should by no means be that allparties, all trends and shades of opinion fuse in a revolu-tionary chaos. 
 On the contrary, the growth and spread ofthe revolutionary movement, its constantly deeper pene-tration among the various classes and strata of the people, will inevitably give rise (all to the good) to constantly newer trends and shades. 
 Only full clarity and definiteness in theirmutual relations and in their attitude towards the positionof the revolutionary proletariat can guarantee maximumsuccess for the revolutionary movement. 
 Only full clarityin mutual relations can guarantee the success of an agree-ment to achieve a common immediate aim. 
 This immediate aim is outlined quite correctly, in our opinion, in Gapon’s letter, namely: (1) the overthrow ofthe autocracy; (2) a provisional revolutionary government;(3) the immediate amnesty to all fighters for political andreligious liberties, including, of course, the right to strike, etc. 
; (4) the immediate arming of the people; and (5) the immediate convocation of an All-Russian Constituent As-sembly on the basis of universal, equal, and direct suffrageby secret ballot. 
 The immediate translation into life by therevolutionary government of complete equality for all cit-izens and complete political freedom during elections is, of course, taken for granted by Gapon; but this might have been stated explicitly. 
 It would be advisable also to includein the general policy of the provisional government theestablishment everywhere of revolutionary peasant com-mittees for the purpose of supporting the democratic rev-olution and putting into effect its various measures. 
 The success of the revolution depends largely on the revolu-tionary activity of the peasantry itself, and the varioussocialist and revolutionary-democratic parties would prob-ably agree on a slogan such as we have suggested. 
 It is to be hoped that Gapon, whose evolution from views shared by a politically unconscious people to revolu-tionary views proceeds from such profound personal exper-iences, will achieve the clear revolutionary outlook thatis essential for a man of politics. 
 It is to be hoped that his appeal for a militant agreement for the uprising will meet with success, and that the revolutionary proletariat, side by side with the revolutionary democrats, will strike at the autocracy and overthrow it all the more quicklyand surely, and with the least sacrifices. 
 Vperyod , No. 
 7, Published according to February 21 (8), 1905 the text in Vperyod SHOULD WE ORGANISE THE REVOLUTION? It happened a long, long time ago, more than a year ago. 
 According to the testimony of the not unknown German Social-Democrat, Parvus, “fundamental differences” hadarisen in the Russian Party. 
 It had become the primary political task of the party of the proletariat to combat the extremes of centralism, the idea of “giving orders” to theworkers from some obscure Geneva and the over-estimationof the idea of an organisation of agitators, of an organisa-tion of leaders. 
 Such was the deep, firm, and unshakableconviction of the Menshevik Parvus, expressed in his weekly German news-sheet Aus der Weltpolitik for November 30, 1903. 
 It was pointed out at the time to the estimable Parvus (see Lenin’s letter to the editors of Iskra , December 1903 *) that he was the victim of a piece of scandal-mongering, that what he took for fundamental differences were at bottom mere squabbles, and that the shift in the new Iskra ’s ideas, which was becoming noticeable, was a shift towards oppor-tunism. 
 Parvus fell silent, but his “ideas” on over-estimatingthe importance of an organisation of leaders were taken upand worked to death by the new-Iskrists. 
 Fourteen months went by. 
 The disruptive work of the Mensheviks within the Party and the opportunist nature oftheir propaganda became perfectly clear. 
 January 9, 1905,fully revealed the vast reserve of revolutionary energypossessed by the proletariat, as well as the utter inade-quacy of Social-Democratic organisation. 
 Parvus came tohis senses. 
 He wrote an article in Iskra , No. 
 85, which, in fact, was a volte-face from the new ideas of the opportunist *See present edition, Vol. 
 7, pp. 
 121-22. 
— Ed. 
 new Iskra to the ideas of the revolutionary old Iskra . 
 “There was a hero,” Parvus exclaims, referring to Gapon, “but no political leader, no programme of action, no organisation.... 
 The lack of organisation produced tragic results.... 
 Themasses are disunited, everything is without plan, there is nocoalescing centre, no guiding programme of action.... 
 Themovement has declined for lack of a coalescing and guidingorganisation. 
” And Parvus proposes the slogan which we sug-gested in issue No. 
 6 of Vperyod —“Organise the Revolution! ” * The lessons of the revolution have convinced Parvus that “under present political conditions we cannot organise thehundreds of thousands” (the reference is to the massesready for revolt). 
 “But,” he says, repeating with good rea-son an idea expressed long ago in What Is To Be Done? , “we can create an organisation that would serve as a combin-ing ferment, and, at the moment of revolution, rally thehundreds of thousands to its side. 
 We must organise workers’circles which shall have a clearly defined task, namely, toprepare the masses for the uprising, to rally them to our sideat the time of the uprising, and to launch the uprising when the slogan is issued. 
” At last! we exclaimed with relief, when we came across these old truths buried amid the rubbish of the newIskra . 
 At last the revolutionary instinct of a functionary of the proletarian party has prevailed, if only temporarily,over Rabocheye Dyelo opportunism. 
 At last we hear the voice of a Social-Democrat who does not cringe before the revolution’s rearguard but fearlessly points to the need forsupporting the van of the revolution. 
 The new-Iskrists, of course, could not agree with Parvus. 
 “We do not share all the views expressed by ComradeParvus,” says the editors’ note. 
 We should say not! Catch them “sharing” views which hit out at all the opportunist nonsense they have beenspewing for the last eighteen months! “Organise the Revolution!” But have we not our wise Comrade Martynov, who knows that a revolution is causedby a complete change in social relations, that a revolu-tion cannot be timed? Martynov will point out to Parvus *See pp. 
 148-57 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 his mistake and prove that even if the latter had in mind the organisation of the vanguard of the revolution, it is nevertheless a “narrow” and noxious “Jacobin” idea. 
 Besides, our wise Martynov has a Tryapichkin61 on a string in the shape of Martov, who is capable of rendering his teacher moreprofound and who can well substitute the slogan “ Unleash the Revolution!” for the slogan “Organise the Revolution!”(see No. 
 85; the author’s italics). 
 Yes, dear reader, this is the slogan we are given in Iskra ’s leading article. 
 These days, apparently, it is enough to “unleash” one’s tongue for a free chatter-process, or forthe process of chatter, in order to be able to write leadingarticles. 
 The opportunist invariably requires slogans that,on closer scrutiny, are found to be nothing but high-sounding phrases, nothing but decadent word-jugglery. 
 “Organise, and again organise!” Parvus urges, for all the world as if he had turned Bolshevik. 
 He does not under-stand, poor fellow, that organisation is a process (Iskra , No. 
 85, as well as all the previous numbers of the new Iskra , particularly the magnificent feuilletons of the magnificent Rosa). 
 He does not know, poor devil, that according to the whole spirit of dialectical materialism, tactics are as much aprocess as organisation is. 
 Like a “conspirator” he runs aboutwith his organisation-as-plan. 
 Like a “utopian”, he imaginesthat one can simply up and organise the thing offhand atsome, God forbid, Second or Third Congress. 
 The “Jacobin” Pillars of Hercules this Parvus talks him-self up to! “To launch the uprising when the slogan is is-sued”—imagine that! It is even worse than the idea of “timing”the uprising, which has been exploded by our redoubtableMartynov. 
 Really, Parvus ought to take a lesson or two fromMartynov. 
 He should read Iskra , No. 
 62; the leading article will tell him of the harmful “ utopian ” ideas about preparing the insurrection, which were spread so prematurely in ourParty in 1902 and 1904. 
 He should read Axelrod’s forewordto “A Worker’s” pamphlet to learn what “a deep-seated,harmful canker [ sic!], downright destructive to the Party”, Social-Democracy is threatened with on the part of people who “pin all their hopes on spontaneous revolts of the most backward, least class-conscious, and positively uncivilised[!] elements of the masses”. 
 Parvus admits that it is impossible at present to or-ganise the hundreds of thousands, and he considers it our primary task “to create an organisation that would serve as a combining ferment”. 
 How can the new-Iskrists helpsquirming when such things appear in the columns of theirpaper? Obviously, an organisation that will serve as a com-bining ferment is simply an organisation of professionalrevolutionaries, at the mere mention of which our new-Iskrists go off into a swoon. 
 We are grateful indeed to Iskra for its leading article, which it has printed alongside Parvus’s. 
 How marked isthe contrast between this empty, muddled phrase-mongeringof the tail-ender and the clear, distinct, forthright, andbold revolutionary slogans of the old Iskra . 
 Is it not sheer bombast to say that “the policy of confidence is quitting the stage never again to fool Russia or Europe”? As a matter of fact, any issue of a European bourgeois newspaper showsthat this fooling is still being carried on with success. 
 “Mod-erate Russian liberalism has been dealt its death-blow. 
”It is childish political naïveté to believe liberalism dead when it is merely trying to be “politic” and to lie low. 
 Lib-eralism is very much alive, it has taken on a new lease oflife. 
 Indeed, it is now on the threshold of power. 
 The reasonit is lying low is that it wants to make its bid for power atthe right moment with the greatest certainty of successand the least risk. 
 For this reason it is so assiduously making up to the working class. 
 One must be hopelessly short-sighted to take this flirtation (a hundred times more dan-gerous for being practised at the moment) seriously and todeclare boastfully that “the proletariat—the liberator of thecountry, the proletariat—the vanguard of the whole nation,has now had its heroic role recognised by the public opinion of the progressive elements of the liberal-democratic bour-geoisie. 
” Gentlemen of the new Iskra , when will you under-stand that the liberal bourgeoisie acknowledges the prole-tariat as hero for the very reason that this proletariat, though dealing a blow at tsarism, is not yet strong enough,not yet Social-Democratic enough, to win for itself the kind of freedom it wants. 
 When will you understand that what we must do is not to boast about the present bowing andscraping of the liberals, but to warn the proletariat against it and show up what lies behind it. 
 You do not see that? Then look at what the industrialists , merchants , and stockbrokers are saying about the necessity of a con-stitution. 
 How plainly these declarations speak of the deathof moderate liberalism! The liberal windbags prate aboutthe heroism of the proletarians, while the industrialistsweightily and imperiously demand a skimpy constitution—that is how matters stand, dear “leaders ”! * But nothing can compare with Iskra ’s arguments on the question of arming. 
 “The work of arming the proletariatand systematically building up the organisation which shallguarantee that the people’s attack upon the governmentshall take place simultaneously everywhere” is declared tobe a “technical” (?!) job. 
 And we, of course, are above such trivialities as technique, we go to the root of things. 
 “Impor-tant though they are (the ‘technical’ jobs), it is not upon them that our efforts should be concentrated in preparing the masses for revolt.... 
 All the efforts of the underground organ-isations will count for nothing if they fail to arm the peoplewith the one indispensable weapon— a sense of the burning necessity to attack the autocracy and to arm for the purpose. 
 It is on propaganda among the masses to arm themselvesfor the purpose of revolt that we should concentrate our efforts. 
” (The italics in the last two passages are theauthor’s. 
) This is indeed a profound way of stating the issue, noth-ing like the narrow-minded Parvus, who almost reached the point of “Jacobinism”. 
 The crux of the matter is notin the work of arming or in the systematic building up ofthe organisation, but in arming the people with a sense ofthe burning necessity to arm. 
 What a painful feeling of *The above lines had been written when we received from the liberal camp the following information, which is not without interest. 
 The St. 
 Petersburg special correspondent of the German bourgeois-democratic newspaper Frankfurter Zeitung (February 17, 1905) quotes a liberal St. 
 Petersburg journalist on the political situation: “The libe-rals would be fools to let a moment like the present slip by. 
 The libe-rals now hold all the trumps, for they have succeeded in hitching the workers to their cart , whereas the government has no one, since the bureaucracy does not give anyone a chance to get ahead. 
” What sublimesimplicity must be reigning in the new Iskra for them to be writing about the death of liberalism at such a moment! shame for Social-Democracy comes upon one at the sight of these philistine platitudes, which seek to drag our movement back! To arm the people with a sense of the burning necessity to arm is the constant, common duty of the Social-Democrats always and everywhere, and it can be appliedequally to Japan as it can to England, to Germany as itcan to Italy. 
 Wherever there are oppressed classes strugglingagainst exploitation, the doctrine of the socialists, from the very start, and in the first place, arms them with a sense of the burning necessity to arm, and this “ necessity ” is present when the labour movement begins . 
 Social-Democracy has only to make this burning necessity a conscious one, to bringhome to those who are conscious of it the need for organisa-tion and planned action, the need for considering the whole political situation. 
 Dear Editor of Iskra ! Please drop in at any meeting of German workers and see the hatred towards,let us say, the police, that burns in the faces there; what bit-ter sarcasms and clenched fists you will hear and see there!What is the force that holds in check this burning necessityto mete out summary justice to the bourgeoisie and its ser-vitors who ill-use the people? It is the force of organisation and discipline, the force of consciousness, the consciousnessthat individual acts of assassination are absurd, that thehour for the serious revolutionary struggle of the people hasnot yet struck, that the political situation is not ripe for it. 
That is why, under such circumstances, no socialist will ever bid the people arm, but he will always make it his duty (otherwise he is no socialist, but a mere windbag) to armthem with a sense of the burning necessity to arm and attackthe enemy. 
 However, the conditions in Russia todaydiffer from these everyday conditions of work; therefore, therevolutionary Social-Democrats, who until now have never issued a call to arms but have always equipped the workers with a sense of the burning necessity to arm—therefore,the revolutionary Social-Democrats, following the initia-tive of the revolutionary workers, have now issued the slo-gan, To arms ! At such a time, when this slogan has at last been issued, Iskra delivers itself of the statement that the main thing is not arming, but the burning necessity to arm. 
 What is this but sterile intellectualist logic-chopping andhopeless Tryapichkin-ism? Are not these people dragging the Party back, away from the pressing tasks of the revo-lutionary vanguard to the contemplation of the proletariat’s “posterior”? This unbelievable vulgarisation of our tasks is due not to the individual qualities of one or other Trya-pichkin, but to their entire position, which has been so inim-itably formulated in the catchwords organisation-as-proc-ess and tactics-as-process. 
 Such a position in itself neces-sarily condemns a man to fear all definite slogans, to shy at all “plans”, to back away from bold revolutionary initia-tive, to philosophise and chew the cud, to be in fear ofrunning too far ahead—and this at a time when we Social-Democrats are obviously lagging behind the proletariat inrevolutionary activity. 
 Truly the dead are clutching at theliving; the dead theories of Rabocheye Dyelo lie like a dead hand upon the new Iskra too. 
 Let us consider Iskra ’s arguments regarding “the polit-ically leading role of Social-Democracy as the vanguardof the class destined to emancipate the nation. 
” “We canneither attain that role,” we are told, “nor firmly estab-lish our title to it even if we take over full control of the technical organisation and conduct of the uprising. 
” Think of it! We cannot attain the role of vanguard even if wesucceed in taking full control of the conduct of the upris-ing! And these people presume to speak of vanguard! Theyfear history will impose upon them the leading role in the democratic revolution, and they are terrified at the thought of having “to conduct the uprising”. 
 The thought lurks at the back of their minds—only they do not yet dare to voice itoutright in the columns of Iskra —that the Social-Democratic organisation must not “conduct the uprising”, that it must not strive to take full control over the revolutionary transi-tion to the democratic republic. 
 They scent in this, these incorrigible Girondists of socialism, monstrous Jacobinism. 
 62 They do not understand that the harder we strive to take full control of the conduct of the uprising, the greater willour share in the undertaking be, and that the greater thisshare is, the less will the influence of the anti-proletarianor non-proletarian democrats be. 
 They are determined to be at the tail-end; they have even invented a philosophy of their own to prove that the tail-end is the right place forthem. 
 Martynov has actually begun to expound this philosophy, and tomorrow, no doubt, he will dot the i’s in the columns of Iskra . 
 Let us try to follow the argument step by step: “The class-conscious proletariat, governed by the logic of the spontaneous process of historical development, willutilise for its own purposes all the elements of organisation,all the elements of ferment which the eve of the revolutioncreates.... 
” Fine! But to utilise all elements means to assume full leadership. 
 Iskra defeats its own purpose and, realising this, hastens to add: “... wholly undismayed by the fact that all these ele-ments rob it of a share in the technical leadership of therevolution itself and thus involuntarily help to carry our demands to the most backward sections of the masses. 
” Can you make anything of this, dear reader? To utilise all elements, undismayed by the fact that they rob us of a share in the leadership ?! But, hold on, gentlemen, if we really utilise all elements, if it is really our demands that are adopted by those we utilise, then they do not rob u s of the leadership, but accept our leadership. 
 If, on the other hand, all these elements really rob us of the leadership (and of course not only “technical” leadership, because toseparate the “technical” side of a revolution from its politi-cal side is sheer nonsense), then it is not we who utilise them, but they us. 
 “We should be only too glad if, following the priest who popularised among the masses our demand for the separationof the Church from the State, if, following the monarchistworkers’ society which arranged the popular processionto the Winter Palace, the Russian revolution would find itself the richer by a general, who would be the first to lead the masses in the last fight against the tsar’s troops, orby a government official who would be the first to proclaimthe formal overthrow of the rule of the tsars. 
” Yes, we too should be glad of it, but we should not want a feeling of joy over pleasant prospects to overshadow our sense of logic. 
 What is meant by the Russian revolution finding itself the richer by a priest or a general? What ismeant is that the priest or the general will become an adher-ent or leader of the revolution. 
 These “tyros” may be fully or not quite fully conscious adherents of the revolution. 
 In the latter event (which is the more probable with tyros) we must deplore, not welcome, their lack of consciousnessand do our utmost to cure and fill this lack . 
 As long as we leave this undone, as long as the masses follow a leader whois lacking in consciousness, we have to admit that it is notthe Social-Democrats who utilise these elements, but vice versa. 
 Yesterday’s priest, general, or government official who becomes an adherent of the revolution, may be a prej-udice-ridden bourgeois democrat, and insofar as the work-ers will follow him the bourgeois democrats will be “utllis-ing” the workers. 
 Is this clear to you, gentlemen of the newIskra ? If it is, then why do you fear the assumption of lead-ership by the fully conscious ( that is , Social-Democratic) adherents of the revolution? Why do you fear lest a Social-Democratic officer (I purposely select an analogous example)and member of the Social-Democratic organisation assume,“completely take over”, the functions and tasks of yourhypothetical general at the initiative and on the instructions of that organisation? To return to Parvus. 
 He concludes his excellent article with the excellent advice to get rid of the disorganisers by“throwing them overboard”. 
 To get rid of the disorganisersis, as the items in our Party News column show, 63 the most impassioned and emphatic slogan of the majority of the Russian Social-Democrats. 
 Precisely, Comrade Parvus, they must be “thrown overboard” in the mostruthless fashion, and the throwing must start with thoseheroes of the Social-Democratic press who have been sanc-tioning disruption by their organisation-as-process and organ-isation-as-tendency “theories”. 
 The thing is not merely to talk of it, but to do it. 
 We must convene immediately a congress of all Party workers who wish to organise the Par-ty. 
 We must not confine ourselves to persuasion and toappeals, but must put a direct and inexorable ultimatumto all who hesitate, to all who waver, vacillate, and doubt:“Make your choice!” From the first issue of our newspaper we have sounded that ultimatum on behalf of the Editorial Board of Vperyod , on behalf of the mass of Russian Party workers who have been driven to intense exasperation by the disorganisers. 
 Make haste, then, and throw them overboard, comrades, and let us settle down to the work of organisation with a hearty good will. 
 Better a hundred revolutionary Social-Democrats who have accepted organisation-as-planthan a thousand intellectuals of the Tryapichkin tribe whoprattle about organisation-as-process. 
 Vperyod , No. 
 7, Published according to February 21 (8), 1905 the text in Vperyod THE CONVENING OF THE THIRD PARTY CONGRESS THE EDITORS The Editorial Board of Vperyod can only state that it is completely in sympathy with the initiative of the Russian Bureau. 
 At last an energetic step has been made towardsa way out of the situation created by the Bonapartistsabroad, 64 and a way out along Party lines! In our Party News column we publish reports showing the alacrity withwhich the committees are responding to the call issued by the Bureau. 
 May their example be followed by each and every group and organisation, as well as by individuals who consider themselves members of the R.

 or who atleast stand close to it in their views and sympathies. 
 TheThird Congress is the first to be convened under conditions whereby its composition (as set forth in the Party Rules), its proceedings, and the basis of participation are known beforehand. 
 Let all comrades then make the most of theseconditions! Let them not forget that our Party Rules guar-antee to everybody an opportunity to appeal to the Congress. 
(See Clause 10: “Every Party member, as well as any person having any dealings with the Party , has the right to demand that any statement he may submit to the Central Committee, to the Editorial Board of the Central Organ, or to a Party Congress be delivered in the original. 
”) Let everyone take advantage of this opportunity immediately . 
 The Editorial Board of Vperyod undertakes to deliver such statements to the Russian Bureau, which has now been constituted as the Organising Committee of the Congress. 
 The right to vote at the Congress is restricted to representatives of committees andof other qualified Party organisations as defined by the Rules. 
 But the Congress itself may extend to everyone the right of participation with consultative voice, while the Organising Committee may grant this right to delegates from Party organisations not possessing full-rights status. 
 (Clause 3,Note 2, of the Party Rules: “The Central Committee is auth-orised to invite to a congress, with consultative voice,delegates from organisations which do not fulfil the condi-tions stipulated in Note 1,” viz. 
, organisations whose quali-fication has not been confirmed a year prior to the Congress. 
 It goes without saying that when the Organising Com-mittee is instructed by the majority of the committees toconvene a congress against the will of the Bonapartist Cen-tral Committee and Council, it takes over all the rights ofthe C. 
C. 
 with regard to such convocation. 
) The Editorial Board of Vperyod proposes to the Congress the following tentative agenda : (1) Constitution of the Con-gress (standing orders, report of the Organising Committee,examination of credentials). 
 (2) Delegates’ reports. 
 (3) TheParty crisis. 
 * (4) Organisational question. 
 (5) Attitude towards insurrection. 
 (6) Agreement with the revolutionary democrats for purposes of the insurrection. 
 (7) Attitude towards the liberals. 
 (8) Work among the peasantry andsupport of the revolutionary peasant movement. 
 (9) Workamong the troops. 
 (10) Improvement of propaganda andagitation. 
 (11) election of officers. 
 The active participation of all Party members in draft-ing and preparing reports and resolutions on these and other major questions (as well as in the collection of material forreports) is absolutely essential for the success of the Congress. 
We call upon all adherents of the Party principle to starton this work at once. 
 Everyone who has been involved in one way or other in the trials and tribulations of the Party crisis can help the Congress by a brief statement of his experiences and his view of the way out. 
 Everyone who has *Bebel wrote to Lenin offering his services as arbitrator between the supporters of Iskra and the supporters of Vperyod . 
 Lenin replied that neither he nor any other Vperyod supporters within his knowledge had the right to take any action binding upon the whole Party, and that Bebel’s proposal would, therefore, have to be submitted to the Party Congress that was being called by the Russian Bureau. 
 We thinkthe Congress could include this proposal in the item “Party crisis”. 
 worked in any Party or Party-connected organisation can give invaluable information, based on personal experience, for solving various aspects of the organisational question. 
 (The contributions might cover such points as time and placeof the activity; membership of the particular organisation—number of workers and number of intellectuals; the relationsbetween them; whether written rules are needed, and which;whether there should be any fixed rules—and if so, to what extent—governing the limits of autonomy and of the division of labour of the groups belonging to the Party orconnected with it, co-optation and expulsion of members;the elective principle; the attitude of the committees to thegroups of propagandists, agitators, and organisers, to thedistrict circles and factory circles, to the publicists’ com-mittees, technical committees, etc. 
, etc. 
) The Vperyod Editorial Board has already received some material on work among the peasants and the soldiers. 
 Weknow of one group which is working systematically on a sum-mary of the experience acquired by its members in the fieldof propaganda, agitation, and organisation, and is prepar-ing a report for the Congress. 
 We have been promised the report of a comrade who helped to organise hundreds o f workers for armed resistance in the event of an anti-Jewishpogrom in a certain large city, and a report on the questionof street fighting from another comrade who has made astudy of military science. 
 It is of the highest importance that the greatest possible number of comrades undertake such and similar work at once . 
 The Party crisis has been clarified in our literature down to the minutest detail. 
 The discussion of this questioncannot and should not take up much time. 
 The keynoteof the Congress should be the new questions of organisation and tactics, which are being brought to the fore by the new gigantic upswing in our revolutionary movement. 
 In thesolution of these questions the collective experience of all Social-Democrats who have been in any way active in themovement will be of inestimable value. 
 But we must gatherthis experience as soon as possible and make it available for discussion at the Congress. 
 To work, then, comrades! Let everyone who has the interests of the Social-Democratic working-class movement at /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR heart bestir himself at once to give the Congress his active aid. 
 Then the Party will quickly emerge from this period of temporary abasement and enfeeblement on to the path of most active participation in the great Russian revolution,the path leading to victory over the accursed enemy of theRussian people! Vperyod , No.

 A LETTER TO THE ORGANISATIONS IN RUSSIA February 28, 1905 Dear Comrades, We have just received the news that St. 
 Petersburg, Tula, Moscow, the North, Nizhni-Novgorod, the Caucasus, andOdessa have declared for the Congress, and other placeswill, of course, follow suit. 
 The Central Committee is saidto have gone on record for the Congress. 
 Naturally, no onewill believe the C. 
C. 
 now. 
 Everyone says it may as well come to the Congress, since everyone has been invited, but it is the Bureau and the Bureau alone that is conveningthe Congress. 
 There is hardly any need to ask why there isnot a grain of confidence left in the C. 
C, (even the few com-pletely isolated voices raised in its favour were immediatelyretracted). 
 Everybody understands that the C. 
C. 
 is only deceiving people and playing the diplomat. 
 It is extremely important that preparations for the Con-gress be started immediately and that zealous efforts be madeto enlist the co-operation of all circles, including district,propaganda, and factory circles, in short, all, especiallyworkers’, circles. 
 We speak of this also in Vperyod , No. 
 8, * (out today). 
 It would be very useful to have workers attend the Congress. 
 (In our opinion admittance on a consultativevoice basis should be accorded as liberally as possible. 
 Thus,it is only a question of funds. 
 Spread your agitation wider. 
We are convinced that it is possible to find workers whowill collect from 150 to 200 rubles to cover the expenses of a delegate; special donors for the same purpose can also be *See pp.

 found among the intellectuals. 
) Important questions will be discussed at the Congress: organisation, the attitude towards the periphery organisations, the insurrection, arming of the workers (installation of dynamite workshops), agree-ment with the Socialists-Revolutionaries for an uprising,support of the revolutionary peasant movement, and manyother issues. 
 Reports on work among the troops and the peas-antry are of the utmost importance. 
 Make the widest pos-sible use of contacts with officers, students, and so on for the Congress. 
 The Congress will be asked to substituteLenin’s formulation of Clause 1 of the Rules for Martov’s,and to extend the rights of Party and Party-connected organisations. 
 This will cover many elements of revolution-ary democracy. 
 Let each and every one prepare most actively for the Congress. 
 Hearty greetings, Lenin St. 
 Petersburg has begun to send us copies of the minutes of workers’ meetings held in various districts. 
 An example worth imitating. 
 It is our earnest request that the workers themselves write, and keep on writing, to Vperyod . 
 First published in 1926 Published according to in Lenin Miscellany V the manuscript GENERAL PLAN OF THE THIRD CONGRESS DECISIONS R e s o l u t i o n s : 1. 
 (a) Read object of the Minority: composition of the centres. 
 (b) Non-compliance with Congress decisions. 
 (c) Split before the League Congress: formation of a secret organisation. 
 (d) Dishonesty of this act and all resultant disorganisation. 
 (e) The shame of trying to justify disruptive activities by theories concerning organisation-as-process, organisa-tion-as-tendency, by hypocritical cries about bureaucratism,formalism, etc. 
 (f) Enormous harm done to the constructive work in Rus-sia by their disorganisation. 
 (g) Necessity of complete dissociation from the disor-ganisers. 
 (h) Authorisation to the centres to issue a pamphlet briefly setting forth the causes and the history of the split, and notification to international Social-Democracy. 
 2. 
 (a) It is necessary to have expressions of opinion on the so-called conciliationist tendency. 
 (b) Its only honest non-hypocritical representative was Plekhanov, when he wrote No. 
 52 of Iskra . 
 (c) Congress acknowledges the correctness of Plekhanov’s stand at the Second Congress of the Party and at the Con-gress of the League, and the sincerity of his desire for peacethrough co-optation. 
 (d) Unfortunately, Plekhanov failed to maintain his position on concessions towards the revisionists and individ-ualist anarchists; the attempts on his part at justification in principle are obviously wrong and are only likely to create confusion in people's minds and introduce an elementof artfulness in inner-Party relations. 
 (e) The so-called conciliators are nothing but hypocritical Mensheviks. 
 No independent platform of conciliation exists other than Plekhanov’s, and that, too, he has now rejected (personal concessions, but disputes on points of principle with the revisionists and anarcho-individualists). 
 3. 
 (a) The Congress recognises differences on points of prin-ciple between our position and that of the new-Iskrists. 
 (b) The new-Iskrists’ utter instability on points of prin-ciple goes back to the Second Congress, where they first wholly opposed the opportunist wing and ended up (albeitagainst their own will and consciousness) by turningtowards it. 
 (c) After the Second Congress the opportunist tendency became still more pronounced; in the organisation itself systematic petty betrayals were justified. 
 The blunting of such a weapon of the proletarian class struggle as organisa-tion. 
 Distortion of Marxism to the extent of justifying andextolling disorganisation and intellectualist anarchism. 
 (d) In regard to questions of the general line of its policy, Iskra should have admitted the “gulf between the new Iskra and the old Iskra ”. 
 A shift towards tail-ism. 
 (e) In tactics this was expressed in the attitude towards the liberals. 
The Zemstvocampaign. 
 (f) ”” ” ” ” ” ” towards the insurrection. 
 Attempts todrag backand confuse. 
 (g) ”” ” ” ” ” ” towards arm-ing. 
 (h) ”” ” ” ” ” ” towards de-moralisationof the back-ward work-ers with theslogan “inde-pendent ac-tivity of theworkers”, etc. 
 (i) On the whole, the new-Iskrists =an opportunist wing of the Party. 
 Basically ill-assorted elements in their camp Organisation-as-process Instability on questions ofParty and class principle (Second Congress). 
 Liberals and Zemstvo Shift towards opportunist campaign Rabocheye Dyelo (a gulf). 
 Insurrection Their approval by party-fringe Arming intellectuals and open Revolutionary dicta-opportunists à la Struve. 
 torship N ecessity of struggle for the line of the old Iskra . 
 4. 
 (a) Insincere nature of the cries about a party of the intelligentsia. 
 Utilised by the liberals. 
 New-Iskrists them-selves have disavowed it. 
 (b) Demagogic nature of propaganda among the workers.

 DRAFT RESOLUTIONS FOR THE THIRD CONGRESS OF THE R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 Written in February 1905 First published in 1926 Published according to in Lenin Miscellany V the manuscript 1 RESOLUTION ON THE DISRUPTIVE BEHAVIOUR OF THE MENSHEVIKS, OR NEW-ISKRISTS The Congress deems it necessary to place definitely on record the conclusively proved facts concerning the behaviour of the Mensheviks, or new-Iskrists, after the Second Party Congress. 
 Without even attempting to question the valid-ity of the decisions adopted by, and the elections heldat, this Congress, they have shamelessly flouted its decisions. 
Immediately after the Congress they boycotted the centralbodies it set up, and formed within the Party, and behind its back, a separate organisation. 
 The aim of this organisa-tion was to foist on the Editorial Board of the CentralOrgan and on the Central Committee of the Party the sixcandidates who had been turned down by the Congress. 
 Toattain this end, in opposition to the will and the interests ofthe Party, the Mensheviks everywhere disorganised the Par-ty’s constructive work. 
 Everywhere they secretly split the Party and demoralised the comradely relations among theSocial-Democrats; they turned the Central Organ of theParty into an organ of gossip and squabbles, heaping vul-gar abuse on the Party committees that had elected the cen-tral bodies and demanded from them an accounting; they reduced the Party Council to a mere instrument of factional feuds and had no scruples about falsifying the voice of theParty which demanded the Third Congress. 
 The Congress most emphatically condemns this disrup-tive conduct and warns all Party-conscious Social-Democratsagainst the notorious organisation-as-process theory which has been used to justify disorganisation and which has debased the theory of revolutionary Marxism in an unheard-ofmanner. 
 The Congress affirms that the adherents of the Party Majority, in drawing up resolutions against the disorganisers and in demanding the Third Congress, have exhausted all the resources of honest, comradely struggle against fellow-mem-bers of the Party. 
 Now that the centres set up by the Partyhave definitely cast off all responsibility to the Party, theCongress is compelled to consider them beyond the pale ofthe Party. 
 The Congress declares that adherents of the Party principle have no alternative but to work separately from, and independently of, these disorganisers. 
 The Congresstherefore resolves that followers of the Minority, or new-Iskrists, may not be admitted to membership in any organi-sation of our Party. 
 The Congress instructs the Central Committee of the Par-ty to issue a small pamphlet in explanation of this resolu-tion, for the information of Russian and internationalSocial-Democracy. 
 2 RESOLUTION ON PLEKHANOV’S CONDUCT DURING THE PARTY CRISIS The Congress admits the correctness of Plekhanov’s position at the Second Party Congress and at the Congress of the League Abroad on the questions of programme, tac-tics, and organisation. 
 The Congress acknowledges that afterthe League Congress Plekhanov, in order to restore peacewithin the Party and heal the split caused by the Menshe-viks, proposed a policy of concessions to people whom hehad aptly characterised before the whole Party as revision-ists and anarcho-individualists ( Iskra , No. 
 52, November 7, 1903). 
 The Congress expresses deep regret that Plekhanov didnot maintain this position; that, against the will of theParty, he began to apply the most shameless methods tosecure satisfaction of all the demands of the Mensheviks;that, to justify the Mensheviks, he lowered himself to the point of defending their stand, which he himself had declared to be incorrect in principle, and of inventing themost fantastic differences with the Party Majority. 
 The Congress emphatically condemns such crafty practices in dealing with fellow-members of the Party; for such a policy, no matter by what humane motives in respect to cer-tain individuals it may be prompted, cannot but have a demoralising effect on the Party. 
 3 RESOLUTION ON THE THEORETICAL POSITION OF THE NEW-ISKRISTS The Congress considers it of imperative necessity to com-bat the theoretical position of the Mensheviks, or new-Iskrists, who have deviated from revolutionary Social-Democracy towards opportunism. 
 This had become evidentat the Second Congress of the Party, from certain lines of argument, as well as from the very membership of the Minor-ity, composed as it was of the opponents of the old Iskra and the elements least stable in point of principle. 
 After theSecond Congress this shift of the Mensheviks towards Ra-bocheye Dyelo opportunism became so obvious that they them-selves admitted the existence of a gulf between the old Iskra and the new Iskra . 
 Indeed, on several questions the new Iskra has put forward slogans and theories which are definitelyfalse and which obscure the class-consciousness of the prole-tariat. 
 One such is the organisation-as-process theory, whichreduces Marxism to an apologia for disorganisation andintellectualist anarchism. 
 Another is the reversion to the false ideas concerning the relation of Party to class, which lower the tasks of the Party as vanguard, leader, and organiserof the class. 
 Equally erroneous and reactionary were the pointsadvanced by the new Iskra , in disagreement with the old Iskra , on such questions as the attitude towards the liberals and the plans for a Zemstvo campaign, on the preparation of the uprising and the alleged utopianism of the ideas of tim-ing and carrying through the uprising, on the arming of themasses and their technical and organisational leadership intime of revolution, on the impossibility and undesirabilityof the revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of the prole-tariat and the petty bourgeoisie in the period of the over-throw of the autocracy, etc. 
 The views expressed on these ques-tions tend to set the Party back, not only in the field of the-ory, but in actual practice, and they are particularly harmfuland disastrous to the Party of the revolutionary prole-tariat in the present revolutionary situation prevailing in Russia. 
 The Congress therefore instructs all Party members to explain the falseness of these views in their agitation and propaganda. 
 4 RESOLUTION ON THE RELATIONS BETWEEN WORKERS AND INTELLECTUALS IN THE SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC PARTY The Congress strongly condemns the policy pursued by the new-Iskrists of sowing distrust and animosity betweenworkers and intellectuals within the Social-Democratic or-ganisations. 
 The Congress reminds all class-conscious work-ers that a few years ago similar methods of struggle were used by the Rabocheye Dyelo wing of the Party and that at that time they repudiated such methods. 
 The empty phrasesthrown about by the new-Iskrists concerning the independentactivity of the workers and the elective principle are notaccompanied by any real improvement in the work of our organisations and they demagogically promise the unattain-able. 
 Under conditions of political freedom, our Party canand will be built entirely on the elective principle. 
 Underthe autocracy this is impracticable for the collective thou-sands of workers that make up the Party. 
 The Congress once more calls attention to the task of the consistent adherents of the Social-Democratic Labour Party, namely, to strengthen with all their might the tiesbetween this Party and the masses of the working class, byraising ever broader masses of proletarians and semi-proletar-ians to full Social-Democratic consciousness, by stimulatingtheir revolutionary and Social-Democratic initiative, and by taking care that the working-class masses advance from their own midst the maximum number of workers fully capableof leading the movement and all the Party organisations. 
 The Congress, on behalf of the Party, repeats the advice of the revolutionary Social-Democrats: to form as manyworkers’ organisations belonging to our Party as possible; to strive to bring those workers’ organisations that do not wish to enter the Party, or have no opportunity for so doing,at least into association with the Party; and to make effortsto get the greatest possible member of class-conscious Social-Democratic workers on the Party committees. 
 MODIFICATION OF THE CLAUSE IN THE RULES CONCERNING THE CENTRES A good many of the comrades working in Russia, includ-ing the Bureau of Committees of the Majority, are going onrecord for a single centre in Russia . 
 What would such a reform actually mean? The idea an-mistakably implied in this tendency is that comrades active in Russia should predominate in the one centre. 
 Its realisa-tion depends entirely upon the will of the Congress, whichwill elect the members of the centre. 
 Consequently, thereis nothing to discuss or to talk about on this point. 
 But, to go further, what will be the relation of the Central Organ to the Central Committee? The Central Organ, we are told, is to be a commission appointed by the C. 
C. 
 One (ortwo) members of the Editorial Board of the Central Organmay (say these comrades) sit on the C. 
C. 
 as part of it, aminor part. 
 There arises the question in what way this for-eign section of the C. 
C. 
 will participate in its work. 
 The idea that real participation in the work of the C. 
C. 
 can be achieved “by correspondence” is obviously utopian and couldnot be suggested seriously. 
 It is only with great difficulty,at the cost of tremendous effort, trouble, quarrelling, andvexation, that those working abroad can obtain the scantiestinformation post factum , so that one can only speak of “tak-ing part in deciding things” from abroad through sheer hypocrisy or in order to “sound important”. 
 And so, the choice must be made: either the C. 
C. 
 members (or, correspondingly, member) residing abroad secure provi-sion in the Party Rules (other “agreements” being invalid) for the entire C. 
C. 
 to meet abroad periodically, in which case this supreme centre will, in actual fact , be identical with the present Party Council, i . 
e. 
, it will become a body that meets three, four, or five times a year and gives only general direction to the work; or else for the C. 
C. 
 to meet in Russia and settle all business there , without its component from abroad. 
 In this case the latter is but nominally listed,avowedly fictitiously , as a member of the C. 
C. 
 Actually , he can have no say in deciding general questions. 
 Under such circumstances it is open to doubt whether any people will be found to fill this “post” (or shall we say sinecure?) of “mem-bers from abroad” on the C. 
C. 
! Another (and the last possible) assumption: the C. 
C. 
 to consist entirely of comrades who work in Russia and to con-stitute a single centre. 
 Only such a central body will really be a single Russian centre. 
 For work abroad it establishes an agency. 
 In actual practice , however, this agency will exist as an independent centre. 
 To take the case of the edi-tors of the Central Organ. 
 Clearly we shall need a full Board here, that will only by a long drawn-out process take shape, form a team, and pull together. 
 (It took the people in Russiaeighteen months of hard effort to build up a new Central Organ after the Second Congress, and that notwithstanding the in-tense concern shown throughout Russia for solving the gravegeneral Party crisis. 
) In practice this Board will issue the weekly organ independently. 
 At best the C. 
C. 
 in Russia will show its interest in the way the publication is managed bycalling a “conference” once in six months (or once in eighteen months)—in what way will such a “conference” differ from the “Council”?—or by a “letter” from an individual member of the C. 
C. 
 In practice this foreign Board will conduct agita-tion and train functionaries abroad (lectures, meetings)among hundreds of Party members. 
 The C. 
C. 
 will be physi-cally unable actually to direct this work, actually to manage this work of the foreign Board. 
 It will be physically unable to participate in this work, except through rare conferences with the persons conducting it. 
 Here again—in what waywill these conferences differ from the Council? To sum up: in actual fact, in practice, a “single” Centre will either be a myth , or it will merely boil down, positively and inevitably, to the present system of what is scornfully called “the Triple Centre”. 
 In actual fact, in practice, differ-ences in geographic and political conditions, as well as differences in the character of the work, inevitably and una-voidably necessitate, and will continue to necessitate (until the fall of the autocracy), two centres in our Party, united only from time to time by “ c o n f e r e n c e s ”, which actually will always play the role of supreme or highest “Council”of the Party. 
 It is quite understandable that the reaction against the people abroad should have evoked from those in Russia the general outcry: Down with the people abroad! Down with two centres! This reaction is legitimate and laudable ; for it indicates the tremendous growth of the Party’s strengthand of Party consciousness since the Second Congress. 
 Thisreaction is undeniably a step forward by our Party. 
 But wemust not be misled by the fascination of words; we must not elevate to a “system” the mood of the moment, the passing “resentment” against the “fellows abroad”. 
 No Party systemcan be built on anger. 
 Nothing is easier than to lay down theshort and simple rule of “one centre”. 
 But such a decisionwould bring us no nearer to the solution of the intricate prob-lem of finding methods for uniting actually (not merely on paper) the diverse functions of the work in Russia and abroad. 
 Written in February 1905 First published in 1926 Published according to in Lenin Miscellany V the manuscript QUESTIONNAIRE FOR THE THIRD CONGRESS OF THE PARTY In view of the convocation of the Third Congress of the Party some comrades, practical workers, have asked us to publish the following statement. 
 It would be most desirable at the forthcoming debate on the organisationalquestion at the Congress if the counsels and opinions of thegreatest possible number of comrades who have been workingin Russia were most carefully considered and discussed. 
Therefore, let every such person express his opinion and submit his answers to the following questions. 
 The Editorial Board of Vperyod will collect them and refer them to the Congress, so that every delegate will be able to benefit fromthe collective experience of the mass of his comrades. 
 Themain questions requiring to be clarified with a view to theredrafting of the Rules and the formulation of the resolutions of the Congress are approximately as follows: (1) Place, time and duration of work? (2) Worked as member of a com-mittee, or committee body, if so, of which? Of factory circle,etc. 
? (3) What was the membership of each of the committeesor committee branches, organising groups, etc. 
, as far asyou know it? How many workers and how many intellec-tuals were there in each? (4) What was the normal practice of co-optation to the committee from the periphery? Couldyou give the average duration of work in the periphery?Are there any instances of dissatisfaction arising from co-optation, etc. 
? In your answers a clear line should be drawnbetween the periods before and after the Second Congress. 
 Detailed information on the period before the Second Con-gress is particularly desirable. 
 (5) How many Party organi-sations, groups, circles, etc. 
, were there altogether in the area where you worked? List each group, the number of members, functions, etc. 
 (6) Were there any groups (organi-sations, circles, etc. 
) that were not considered Party groups, but were close to the Party? (7) How did the periphery (andthe various kinds of periphery circles) and the committeemaintain contact? Did these forms of contact satisfy the mem-bers? (8) Do you consider it possible and desirable to intro-duce the elective principle? If not, why not? If you do, then in what manner? Please state explicitly to what groups the right of election ought to be applied. 
 (9) Do you consider theseparation of the committees (groups, circles, organisations,etc. 
) into committees of intellectuals and committees ofworkers to be advisable? If not, why not? If you do, pleaseindicate what form of separation is desirable. 
 (10) Did the committee elect a central, directing group? If it did, how? How often was it controlled? Were you satisfied with itsinauguration? (11) Do you consider it useful and possiblefor the local organisations to have written Rules? (12) Doyou consider it useful to include any regulation concerningthe local organisations (committees and others) in the Party Rules? If you do, please mention what regulations. 
 (13) Do you consider it desirable for the Party Rules to define theexact rights of the Central Committee in the matter ofincluding (and excluding) members from the committees andother organisations? What should be the precise rights ofthe Central Committee? (14) Is it desirable to protect the autonomy of the local committees by introducing special regulations, and if so, what regulations? (15) How often didthe committee, or the group, circle, etc. 
, of which you werea member meet? If possible, list all the meetings held duringthe period of your work. 
 If not, give a rough estimate. 
 Werethere any inconveniences in the holding of frequent meetings? What, in your experience, is the average number of possible and necessary meetings per month and how large should thenumber of participants be? Written prior to February 20 (March 5), 1905 First published in 1926 Published according to in Lenin Miscellany V the manuscript PREFACE TO THE PAMPHLET MEMORANDUM OF POLICE DEPARTMENT SUPERINTENDENT LOPUKHIN There can be too much of a good thing, or so Mr. 
 Lopukhin seems to say in his memorandum. 
 A good thing from thepoint of view of the police is the “temporary” Security Reg-ulations, which, since 1881, have been one of the most stablefundamental laws of the Russian Empire. 
 The police are given all kinds of rights and powers to “keep the populace in hand”, according to the apt expression of the memorandum,which is all the more striking the more often one stumblesover the incredibly ponderous and clumsy official turns ofspeech in which the memorandum is written. 
 Yes, the policehave lived in clover under these “Regulations”, but their “good” features have spoiled them. 
 That is one aspect of the matter. 
 Another is the fact that the emergency measures ofsuppression, which may have seemed extraordinary twenty-five years ago, have since become so ordinary that the popu-lation has adjusted itself to them, so to speak. 
 The repressivesignificance of these emergency measures has weakened, just as a new spring weakens from long and excessive use. 
 The game is not worth the candle, Mr. 
 Lopukhin, Superintendentof the Police Department, implies in his memorandum, whichis written in a curiously melancholy and dismal tone. 
 How gratifying to a Social-Democrat is this dismal tone, this dry, business-like, yet nonetheless devastating criticism by a police official of Russia’s fundamental police law. 
 Gone are the palmy days of policedom! Gone are the sixties, whenthe very existence of a revolutionary party was unthought of. 
Gone are the seventies, when the strength of such a party, whose existence was an undoubted and terrifying fact, was “only equal to individual acts of violence, but not to a political revolution”. 
 In those days, when “underground agitation found support only among individual persons orcircles”, the newly invented spring could still produce someeffect. 
 But how slack this spring has now become, “in thepresent state of society, when dissatisfaction with the exist-ing order of things and a strong opposition movement are be-coming so widespread in Russia”! How absurd and meaning-less these emergency security measures proved to be whenthey had to be, actually had to be, applied in thousands of cases “against workers for engaging in strikes of a peacefulnature and purely economic in motive”, when even cobble-stones had to be classed as dangerous political weapons! In his despair, poor Lopukhin resorts to a double excla-mation mark, which invites Messieurs the Ministers to joinhim in laughing at the absurd consequences to which theSecurity Regulations have led. 
 Everything in these Regula-tions has proved useless ever since the revolutionary move-ment really penetrated among the people and became insepa-rably bound up with the class movement of the working masses—everything, from the rules requiring the registra-tion of passports to the military tribunals. 
 Even the “insti-tution of house janitors,” that blessed godsend to the police,is scathingly criticised by the Polizei -Minister, who accuses it of having an enervating effect on the preventive activities of the police. 
 In truth, the complete bankruptcy of the police regime!This bankruptcy is confirmed, apart from the assertions of such a highly competent person as the most honourableMr. 
 Lopukhin, by the entire course of development of thetsarist policy. 
 When there was no really popular revolution-ary movement, when the political struggle was not yet con-nected and integrated with the class struggle, simple policemeasures against individuals and study circles had theiruse. 
 Against classes these measures proved ludicrously in-effective; by their very profusion they became a hindranceto the work of the police. 
 The once awesome clauses of the Security Regulations have proved to be just miserable, petty, quibbling chicaneries, which tend to stir up discontent amongthe “plain people” who do not belong to the revolutionaries rather than seriously to affect the revolutionaries them-selves. 
 Against the people’s revolution, against the class struggle the police cannot be depended on; one must have the backing of the people, too, the support of classes. 
 Suchis the moral of Mr. 
 Lopukhin’s memorandum. 
 And such isthe moral which the autocratic government is drawing frompractical experience. 
 The springs of the police machineryhave lost their snap; military force alone is now insufficient. 
 One must stir up national hatred, race hatred; one must re-cruit “Black Hundreds” 66 from among the politically least developed sections of the urban ( and, following that , natu-rally , of the rural ) petty bourgeoisie; one must attempt to rally to the defence of the throne all reactionary elementsamong the population at large; one must turn the struggle of the police against study circles into a struggle of one part of the people against the other. 
 That is precisely what the government is now doing when it sets the Tatars against the Armenians in Baku; when itseeks to provoke new pogroms against the Jews; when itorganises Black-Hundred gangs against the Zemstvo people, students, and rebellious Gymnasium youths; and when it appeals to the loyal nobles and to the conservative elementsamong the peasants. 
 Ah, well! We Social-Democrats are notsurprised at these tactics of the autocracy; nor shall webe frightened by them. 
 We know that it will no longer helpthe government to stir up racial animosity since the workers have begun to organise armed resistance to the pogrom-ban-dits; and by relying on the exploiting sections of the pettybourgeoisie the government will only antagonise still broadermasses of real proletarians. 
 We have never expected any polit-ical or social revolutions to come from “convincing” thepowers that be, or from educated persons turning to the paths of “virtue”. 
 We have always taught that it is the class strug-gle, the struggle of the exploited part of the people againstthe exploiters, that lies at the bottom of political transfor-mations and in the final analysis determines the fate of all such transformations. 
 By admitting the complete failure ofthe pettifogging police methods and passing over to the di-rect organisation of civil war, the government shows that the final reckoning is approaching. 
 So much the better. 
 It is launching the civil war. 
 So much the better. 
 We, too, are for the civil war. 
 If there is any sphere in which we feel par-ticularly confident, it is here, in the war of the vast masses of the oppressed and the downtrodden, of the toiling millions who keep the whole of society going, against a handful ofprivileged parasites. 
 Of course, by fanning racial antagonismand tribal hatred, the government may for a time arrest thedevelopment of the class struggle, but only for a short timeand at the cost of a still greater expansion of the field of the new struggle, at the cost of a more bitter feeling among the people against the autocracy. 
 This is proved by theconsequences of the Baku pogrom, which deepened tenfoldthe revolutionary mood of all sections against tsarism. 
 Thegovernment thought to frighten the people by the sight ofbloodshed and the vast toll of street battles; but actually it is dispelling the people ’s fear of bloodshed, of a direct armed encounter. 
 Actually, the government is furthering our cause,with agitation of a scope wider and more impressive than wecould ever have dreamed of. 
 Vive le son du canon! say we in the words of the French revolutionary song: “Hail the thunderof the cannon!” Hail the revolution! Hail the open war of the people against the tsarist government and its adherents!

 Independent organisation of the proletariat—class strug-gle—civil war. 
 In the present movement we all stand on the shoulders of the Commune. 
 Written in February-March 1905 First published in 1931 Published according to in Lenin Miscellany XVI the manuscript First page of Lenin’s manuscript “New Tasks and New Forces”, 1905 Reduced NEW TASKS AND NEW FORCES The development of a mass working-class movement in Russia in connection with the development of Social-Democ-racy is marked by three notable transitions. 
 The first was the transition from narrow propagandist circles to wideeconomic agitation among the masses; the second was thetransition to political agitation on a large scale and to openstreet demonstrations; the third was the transition to actualcivil war, to direct revolutionary struggle, to the armed pop-ular uprising. 
 Each of these transitions was prepared, on the one hand, by socialist thought working mainly in onedirection, and on the other, by the profound changes that hadtaken place in the conditions of life and in the whole mental-ity of the working class, as well as by the fact that increas-ingly wider strata of the working class were roused to more conscious and active struggle. 
 Sometimes these changes took place imperceptibly, the proletariat rallying its forces behindthe scenes in an unsensational way, so that the intellectualsoften doubted the lasting quality and the vital power of themass movement. 
 There would then be a turning-point, andthe whole revolutionary movement would, suddenly, as it were, rise to a new and higher stage. 
 The proletariat and its vanguard, Social-Democracy, would be confronted with newpractical tasks, to deal with which, new forces would spring up, seemingly out of the ground, forces whose existence noone had suspected shortly before the turning-point. 
 But allthis did not take place at once, without vacillations, with-out a struggle of currents within the Social-Democratic movement, without relapses to outworn views long sincethought dead and buried. 
 Social-Democracy in Russia is once again passing through such a period of vacillation. 
 There was a time when politi-cal agitation had to break its way through opportunist theo-ries, when it was feared that we would not be equal to thenew tasks, when excessive repetition of the adjective “class”,or a tail-ender’s interpretation of the Party’s attitude tothe class, was used to justify the fact that the Social-Demo-crats lagged behind the demands of the proletariat. 
 The course of the movement has swept aside all these short-sighted fears and backward views. 
 The new upsurge now is attended oncemore, although in a somewhat different form, by a struggleagainst obsolete circles and tendencies. 
 The Rabocheye Dye-lo-ists have come to life again in the new-Iskrists. 
 To adapt our tactics and our organisation to the new tasks, we have to overcome the resistance of opportunist theories of “a higher type of demonstration” (the plan of the Zemstvo cam-paign), or of the “organisation-as-process”; we have to combatthe reactionary fear of “timing” the uprising, or the fear ofthe revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of the proletariatand the peasantry. 
 Once again, excessive (and very often foolish) repetition of the word “class” and belittlement of the Party’s tasks in regard to the class are used to justifythe fact that Social-Democracy is lagging behind the urgentneeds of the proletariat. 
 The slogan “workers’ independentactivity” is again being misused by people who worshipthe lower forms of activity and ignore the higher forms of really Social-Democratic independent activity, the really revolutionary initiative of the proletariat itself. 
 There is not the slightest doubt that the movement, in its course, will once again sweep aside these survivals ofobsolete and lifeless views. 
 Such sweeping aside, however,should not be reduced to mere rejection of the old errors, but, what is incomparably more important, it should take the form of constructive revolutionary work towards fulfill-ing the new tasks, towards attracting into our Party andutilising the new forces that are now coming into the rev-olutionary field in such vast masses. 
 It is these questionsof constructive revolutionary work that should be the main subject in the deliberations of the forthcoming Third Con-gress; upon these questions all our Party members shouldconcentrate in their local and general work. 
 As to the new tasks that confront us, of this we have spoken in general terms on more than one occasion. 
 They are: to extend our agitation to new strata of the urban and rural poor; to build up a broader, more flexible, and stronger organisation; toprepare the uprising and to arm the people; and, to theseends, to conclude agreements with the revolutionary demo-crats. 
 That new forces have arisen for the fulfilment of thesetasks is eloquently borne out by the reports of general strikes all over Russia, of the strikes and the revolutionary mood among the youth, among the democratic intelligentsia gener-ally, and even among many sections of the bourgeoisie. 
 Theexistence of these tremendous fresh forces and the positiveassurance that only a small portion of the whole vast stockof inflammable material among the working class and the peasantry has so far been affected by the present unprece-dented revolutionary ferment in Russia are a reliable pledgethat the new tasks can and will be unfailingly fulfilled. 
 Thepractical question confronting us now is, first, how to uti-lise, direct, unite, and organise these new forces; how to focus Social-Democratic work on the new, higher tasks of the day without for a moment forgetting the old, ordinary run of tasks that confront us, and will continue to confront us, solong as the world of capitalist exploitation continues toexist. 
 To indicate several methods for dealing with this prac-tical question we shall begin with an individual, but to our mind very characteristic, instance. 
 A short time ago, on the very eve of the outbreak of the revolution, the liberal-bourgeois Osvobozhdeniye (No. 
 63) touched on the question of the organisational work of the Social-Democrats. 
 Closelyfollowing the struggle between the two trends in Social-De-mocracy, Osvobozhdeniye lost no opportunity again and again to take advantage of the new Iskra’s reversion to Economism, in order to emphasise (in connection with the demagogicpamphlet by “A Worker”) its own profound sympathy with theprinciples of Economism. 
 This liberal publication correctlypointed out that the pamphlet (see Vperyod , No. 
 2, on the subject *) implies inevitable negation, or belittlement, of the role of revolutionary Social-Democracy. 
 Referring to *See pp. 
 56-62 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 “A Worker’s” absolutely incorrect assertions that since the victory of the orthodox Marxists the economic struggle has been ignored, Osvobozhdeniye says: “The illusion of present-day Russian Social-Democracy lies in its fear of educational work, of legal ways, of Econ-omism, of so-called non-political forms of the labour move-ment, and in its failure to understand that only educationalwork, legal and non-political forms, can create a sufficiently strong and broad foundation for a working-class movement that will really be worthy of the name revolutionary. 
”Osvobozhdeniye urges its adherents “to take upon themselves the initiative in building a trade union movement”, not inopposition to Social-Democracy, but hand in hand with it;and it draws a parallel between this situation and that which prevailed in the German labour movement during the operation of the Exceptional Law Against the Socialists. 
 73 This is not the place to deal with this analogy, a totally erroneous one. 
 In the first place, it is necessary to reassertthe truth about the attitude of the Social-Democrats towardsthe legal forms of the working-class movement. 
 “The legali-sation of non-socialist and non-political labour unions in Russia has begun,” we wrote in 1902 in What Is To Be Done? * “Henceforth, we cannot but reckon with this tend-ency. 
” How shall we reckon with it?—the question is raisedthere and answered by a reference to the need of exposing,not only the Zubatov theories, but also all liberal harmony speeches about “class collaboration”. 
 (In inviting the collab-oration of the Social-Democrats, Osvobozhdeniye fully ac-knowledges the first task, but ignores the second. 
) “Doingthis,” the pamphlet goes on to say, “does not at all meanforgetting that in the long run the legalisation of the work-ing-class movement will be to our advantage, and not to that of the Zubatovs. 
” In exposing Zubatovism and liberal-ism at legal meetings we are separating the tares from thewheat. 
 “By the wheat we mean attracting the attention ofever larger numbers, including the most backward sections,of the workers to social and political questions, and freeingourselves, the revolutionaries, from functions that are essen-tially legal (the distribution of legal books, mutual aid, *See present edition, Vol. 
 5, p. 
 455. 
— Ed. 
 etc. 
), the development of which will inevitably provide us with an increasing quantity of material for agitation. 
” It follows clearly from this that if anyone is suffering from an “ illusion ” with regard to the question of “ fearing ” the legal forms of the movement, it is Osvobozhdeniye . 
 Far from fearing these forms, the revolutionary Social-Democratsclearly point to the existence within them of tares as well as wheat . 
 Osvobozhdeniye ’s arguments, consequently, only cover up the liberals’ real (and founded) fear that revolu-tionary Social-Democracy will expose the class essence of liberalism . 
 But what interests us most, from the point of view of present-day tasks, is the question of relieving the revolu-tionaries of some of their functions. 
 The very fact that we are now experiencing the beginning of the revolution makes this a particularly topical and widely significant ques-tion. 
 “The more energetically we carry on our revolutionarystruggle, the more the government will be compelled tolegalise part of the trade union work, thereby relieving us ofpart of our burden,” we said in What Is To Be Done? * But the energetic revolutionary struggle relieves us of “part of our burden” in many other ways besides this. 
 The presentsituation has done more than merely “legalise” much of whatwas formerly banned. 
 It has widened the movement to suchan extent that, regardless of government legalisation, manythings that were considered and actually were within reach only of revolutionaries have now entered the sphere of practice, have become customary and accessible to the masses. 
 Thewhole course of Social-Democracy’s historical developmentis characterised by the fact that in face of all obstacles ithas been winning for itself increased freedom of action, de-spite tsarist laws and police measures. 
 The revolutionary pro-letariat surrounds itself, as it were, with a certain atmos-phere, unthinkable for the government, of sympathy and sup-port both within the working class and within other classes(which, of course, agree with only a small part of the demandsof the working-class democrats). 
 In the initial stages of themovement a Social-Democrat had to carry on a great deal of what almost amounted to cultural work, or to concentrate *See present edition, Vol. 
 5, p. 
 491. 
— Ed. 
 almost exclusively on economic agitation. 
 Now these func-tions, one after another, are passing into the hands of new forces, of wider sections that are being enlisted in the move-ment. 
 The revolutionary organisations have concentratedmore and more on carrying out the function of real political leadership, the function of drawing Social-Democratic con-clusions from the workers’ protest and the popular discontent. 
In the beginning we had to teach the workers the ABC, both in the literal and in the figurative senses. 
 Now the standard of political literacy has risen so gigantically that we canand should concentrate all our efforts on the more directSocial-Democratic objectives aimed at giving an organiseddirection to the revolutionary stream. 
 Now the liberals andthe legal press are doing a great deal of the “preparatory” work upon which we have hitherto had to expend so much effort. 
 Now the open propaganda of democratic ideas and de-mands, no longer persecuted by the weakened government,has spread so widely that we must learn to adjust ourselves tothis entirely new scope of the movement. 
 Naturally, in thispreparatory work there are both tares and wheat. 
 Naturally, Social-Democrats will now have to pay greater attention to combating the influence of the bourgeois democrats on theworkers. 
 But this very work will have much more real So-cial-Democratic content than our former activity, whichaimed mainly at rousing the politically unconsciousmasses. 
 The more the popular movement spreads, the more clearly will the true nature of the different classes stand revealedand the more pressing will the Party ’s task be in leading the class, in becoming its organiser, instead of dragging atthe tail-end of events. 
 The more the revolutionary independ-ent activity of all kinds develops everywhere, the more ob-vious will be the hollowness and inanity of the Rabocheye Dyelo catchwords, so eagerly taken up by the new-Iskrists, about independent activity in general, the more significantwill become the meaning of Social-Democratic independent activity, and the greater will be the demands which eventsmake on our revolutionary initiative . 
 The wider the new streams of the social movement become, the greater becomes the importance of a strong Social-Democratic organisationcapable of creating new channels for these streams. 
 The more the democratic propaganda and agitation conducted in-dependently of us works to our advantage, the greater be-comes the importance of an organised Social-Democratic lead-ership to safeguard the independence of the working classfrom the bourgeois democrats. 
 A revolutionary epoch is to the Social-Democrats what wartime is to an army. 
 We must broaden the cadres of ourarmy, we must advance them from peace strength to war strength, we must mobilise the reservists, recall the fur-loughed, and form new auxiliary corps, units, and services. 
We must not forget that in war we necessarily and inevitablyhave to put up with less trained replacements, very often toreplace officers with rank-and-file soldiers, and to speed upand simplify the promotion of soldiers to officers’ rank. 
 To drop metaphor, we must considerably increase the membership of all Party and Party-connected organisationsin order to be able to keep up to some extent with the streamof popular revolutionary energy which has been a hundred-fold strengthened. 
 This, it goes without saying, does notmean that consistent training and systematic instruction in the Marxist truths are to be left in the shade. 
 We must, how-ever, remember that at the present time far greater signif-icance in the matter of training and education attaches tothe military operations, which teach the untrained precisely and entirely in our sense. 
 We must remember that our “doc-trinaire” faithfulness to Marxism is now being reinforced by the march of revolutionary events, which is everywhere furnishing object lessons to the masses and that all these les-sons confirm precisely our dogma. 
 Hence, we do not speakabout abandoning the dogma, or relaxing our distrustfuland suspicious attitude towards the woolly intellectuals andthe arid-minded revolutionaries. 
 Quite the contrary. 
 We speak about new methods of teaching dogma, which it would be unpardonable for a Social-Democrat to forget. 
 We speak ofthe importance for our day of using the object lessons ofthe great revolutionary events in order to convey—not tostudy circles, as in the past, but to the masses—our old,“dogmatic” lessons that, for example, it is necessary in practice to combine terror with the uprising of the masses, or that behind the liberalism of the educated Russian soci-ety one must be able to discern the class interests of our bourgeoisie (cf. 
 our polemics with the Socialists-Revolution-aries on this question in Vperyod , No. 
 3 *). 
 Thus, it is not a question of relaxing our Social-Democrat-ic exactingness and our orthodox intransigence, but ofstrengthening both in new ways, by new methods of training. 
 In war-time, recruits should get their training lessons di-rectly from military operations. 
 So tackle the new methods oftraining more boldly, comrades! Forward, and organise more and more squads, send them into battle, recruit more young workers, extend the normal framework of all Partyorganisations, from committees to factory groups, craftunions, and student circles! Remember that every momentof delay in this task will play into the hands of the enemiesof Social-Democracy; for the new streams are seeking an immediate outlet, and if they do not find a Social-Democratic channel they will rush into a non-Social-Democratic channel. 
Remember that every practical step in the revolutionarymovement will decidedly, inevitably give the young re-cruits a lesson in Social-Democratic science; for this science isbased on an objectively correct estimation of the forces and tendencies of the various classes, while the revolution itself is nothing but the break-up of old superstructures andthe independent action of the various classes, each strivingto erect the new superstructure in its own way. 
 But do notdebase our revolutionary science to the level of mere bookdogma, do not vulgarise it with wretched phrases about tactics-as-process and organisation-as-process, with phrases that seek to justify confusion, vacillation, and lack of ini-tiative. 
 Give more scope to all the diverse kinds of enter-prise on the part of the most varied groups and circles, bearingin mind that, apart from our counsel and regardless of it,the relentless exigencies of the march of revolutionary events will keep them upon the correct course. 
 It is an old maxim that in politics one often has to learn from the enemy. 
 Andat revolutionary moments the enemy always forces correctconclusions upon us in a particularly instructive and speedymanner. 
 To sum up, we must reckon with the growing movement, which has increased a hundredfold, with the new tempo of *See pp. 
 83-89 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 the work, with the freer atmosphere and the wider field of activity. 
 The work must be given an entirely different scope. 
 Methods of training should be refocussed from peaceful in-struction to military operations. 
 Young fighters should berecruited more boldly, widely, and rapidly into the ranksof all and every kind of our organisations. 
 Hundreds of new organisations should be set up for the purpose without amoment’s delay. 
 Yes, hundreds; this is no hyperbole, and let no one tell me that it is “too late” now to tackle such a broad organisational job. 
 No, it is never too late to organise. 
We must use the freedom we are getting by law and the free-dom we are taking despite the law to strengthen and mul-tiply the number of Party organisations of all varieties. 
Whatever the course or the outcome of the revolution may be, however early it may be checked by one or other cir-cumstance, all its real gains will be rendered secure andreliable only insofar as the proletariat is organised. 
 The slogan “Organise!” which the adherents of the majority wanted to issue, fully formulated, at the Second Congressmust now be put into effect immediately. 
 If we fail to show bold initiative in setting up new organisations, we shall have to give up as groundless all pretensions to the role ofvanguard. 
 If we stop helplessly at the achieved boundaries,forms, and confines of the committees, groups, meetings,and circles, we shall merely prove our own incapacity. 
 Thou-sands of circles are now springing up everywhere without our aid, without any definite programme or aim, simply under the impact of events. 
 The Social-Democrats must make ittheir task to establish and strengthen direct contacts with thegreatest possible number of these circles, to assist them,to give them the benefit of their own knowledge and experi-ence, to stimulate them with their own revolutionary ini-tiative. 
 Let all such circles, except those that are avowedly non-Social-Democratic, either directly join the Party oralign themselves with the Party . 
 In the latter event we must not demand that they accept our programme or that theynecessarily enter into organisational relations with us. 
Their mood of protest and their sympathy for the cause of international revolutionary Social-Democracy in themselves suffice, provided the Social-Democrats work effectivelyamong them, for these circles of sympathisers under the impact of events to be transformed at first into democratic assistants and then into convinced members of the Social-Democratic working-class party. 
 There are masses of people, and we are short of people; this contradictory formula has long expressed the contradic-tions between the organisational life and the organisation-al needs of the Social-Democratic Party. 
 Today this con-tradiction is more salient than ever before; we often hear from all sides passionate appeals for new forces, complaints about the shortage of forces in the organisations, while at the sametime we have everywhere countless offers of service, a growthof young forces, especially among the working class. 
 Thepractical organiser who complains of a shortage of peopleunder such circumstances becomes the victim of the illusion from which Madame Roland suffered, when she wrote in 1793, at the peak of the Great French Revolution, that Francehad no men, that there were only dwarfs. 
 People who talkin this manner do not see the wood for the trees; they admitthat they are blinded by events, that it is not they, the rev-olutionaries, who control events in mind and deed, but events that control them and have overwhelmed them. 
 Such organisers had better retire and leave the field clear for young-er forces who often make up with verve what they lack inexperience. 
 There is no dearth of people; never has revolutionary Russia had such a multitude of people as now. 
 Never has a revolutionary class been so well off for temporary allies, conscious friends, and unconscious supporters as the Russianproletariat is today. 
 There are masses of people; all we needdo is get rid of tail-ist ideas and precepts, give full scope toinitiative and enterprise, to “plans” and “undertakings”,and thus show ourselves to be worthy representatives of the great revolutionary class. 
 Then the proletariat of Russia will carry through the whole great Russian revolution a s heroically as it has begun it.

 66, published a review of Marty-nov’s pamphlet Two Dictatorships (approved and recom-mended by the editors of Iskra ; see issue No. 
 84). 
 As was to be expected, the liberal bourgeois does not conceal his sympathies with the opportunist wing of the Social-Demo-cratic movement. 
 Osvobozhdeniye regards Martynov’s pam-phlet, “ like the work of Mr. 
 Akimov ”, as “ one of the most inter-esting contributions to Social-Democratic literature of thepresent day ”. 
 Could a liberal have reacted in any other way to the preaching of tail-ism, which seeks to frightenthe revolutionary class with the dire perspective of partic-ipation in the provisional government and the “revolution-ary dictatorship” in a democratic revolution (which Marty-nov, in his fear of “Jacobinism” confounds with the socialistrevolution!)? Is it merely a coincidence that Osvobozhdeniye , in the article “A Significant Turn”, welcomed Plekhanov’sideas of making concessions to the revisionists? How is oneto account for Osvobozhdeniye ’s assertion (No. 
 57) that “in fact the Menshevists are now defending something morevital and essential than the Bolshevists”? Is it not because“the only hope for the ideological vitality of Russian lib-eralism lies in the vitality of Social-Democratic opportunism” (see our publication An Obliging Liberal *)? Was Mr. 
 Struve right or wrong in contending that Trotsky’s pamphlet Our Political Tasks , published under the editorship of “Iskra ” (see issue No. 
 72) “is perfectly right in defending certain *First published as a leaflet, Geneva, November 6, 1904.

— Ed. 
 ideas with which readers of Social-Democratic literature have been familiar from the writings of Messrs. 
 Akimov, Martynov, Krichevsky, and other so-called Economists” (Osvobozhdeniye , No. 
 57)? Had Martynov and Co. 
 stopped to think of these questions, they might perhaps have beenable to grasp the puzzling (how very, very puzzling!) ideasof the old Iskra about the similarity of the relations be-tween the Jacobins and the Girondists, on the one hand, and between the revolutionary Social-Democrats and the oppor-tunists, on the other. 
 (This idea was first advanced, if weare not mistaken, in the leading article of Iskra , No. 
 2, written by Plekhanov. 
) Were the Girondists traitors to thecause of the Great French Revolution? They were not. 
 Butthey were inconsistent, wavering, opportunist champions of that cause. 
 That is why they were opposed by the Jacobins, who upheld the interests of the advanced class of the eight-eenth century as consistently as the revolutionary Social-Democrats uphold the interests of the advanced class ofthe twentieth. 
 That is why the downright betrayers ofthe cause of the great revolution, the monarchists, the clerical constitutionalists, etc. 
, supported the Girondists and shielded them from the attacks of the Jacobins. 
 Areyou beginning to see light now, most honourable GirondistMartynov? Not yet? Well, we shall try to clarify the pointfurther. 
 Are the new-Iskrists traitors to the proletariancause? No. 
 But they are inconsistent, wavering, opportunist champions of the cause (and of the organisational and tac-tical principles illumining the cause). 
 That is why theirposition is opposed by the revolutionary Social-Democrats(by some directly and overtly, by others covertly, behindthe closed doors of their editorial offices, with devices andruses). 
 That is why the new-Iskrists are ideologically sup-ported and shielded by the Osvobozhdeniye crowd—the down-right betrayers of the proletarian cause. 
 Are you beginning to see light now, most honourable Girondist Martynov? Vperyod , No. 
 9, Published according to March 8 (February 23), 1905 the manuscript EVASIONS WITHOUT END Iskra and the so-called Council are continuing their tac-tics of delay, of pretexts, and of evasion in the matterof convening the Congress. 
 Plekhanov tries to take a formal stand by reiterating with an insistence worthy of a better cause that the Congress is convened by the Council and thattherefore any congress not so convened is illegal. 
 Thisargument is so one-sided and naïvely self-interested thatone is strongly tempted “to give the hare a bit of the bear’sear” *—to give Plekhanov a medal for his meticulous observance of the Party Rules and Party laws! We would most humbly ask the very honourable advocate of the dialec-tic, that is, of the all-round approach: does the Councilexist for the Party or the Party for the Council? Is the Coun-cil accountable to, and controllable by, the Party or is theParty accountable to the Council? Does discipline for the higher body eliminate discipline for the lower body? Will our vigilant limb of the law try to remember the argumentshe used in this connection at the Second Congress of theParty? The Council, according to our Rules, is duty bound to convene a congress when half the votes are cast for it. 
 What is the Party to do when the Council shirks its duties? The Rules of the German Social-Democratic Party give a directanswer to this question, namely, the Congress in such anevent is convened not by the supreme governing body of theParty, but by a special control committee independentof that body. 
 Our Rules give no answer at all to that question. 
 *The allusion is to I. 
 A. 
 Krylov’s fable “The Hare at the Hunt”. 
— Ed. 
 Does this mean, we ask our friends of the new Iskra , that the problem is insoluble? Does it mean that should the Council shirk its Party responsibilities the Party would have to dis-solve and be superseded by the Council? The Party for theCouncil—is that it? We make bold to say that this is not so, that the Party itself is obliged to see to it that its Rules are observed by its functionaries, that “to see to it” does not only mean to criticise by word but to rectify by deed. 
 He who is unable to demand successfully of his agents the discharge of their duties towards those who entrusted them is unworthy of thename of a politically free citizen. 
 He who cannot demandsuccessfully of his agents the discharge of their Party duties towards those who entrusted them is unworthy of the name of Party member. 
 The Council is the agent of the committees. 
 The committees are in duty bound to demand of this agent the discharge of its duties towards those who have entrustedit. 
 This the committees can do only by electing their bureau for convening the Congress. 
 And that is what the committeeshave done. 
 That is what they were obliged to do, if they were conscious of their elementary Party obligations. 
 Will the honourable Comrade Plekhanov, perhaps, try to deny the correctness of this statement? Will he try to nameany Social-Democratic party in the world whose members would have refrained from acting as our committees acted,when faced with the refusal of a given Party body to convene the Party Congress? We challenge you to try, Comrade Plekhanov. 
 Now let us proceed to the second factual question, whether our Council actually did shirk its Party duties in the matterof convening the Congress. 
 This is no mere formal question,since apart from duty under the Rules there is still the duty....

 WHOM ARE THEY TRYING TO FOOL? In issue No. 
 89 of Iskra , just arrived, we find a decision of the “Party Council” dated March 8, 1905. 
 As was to beexpected, the “Council” abroad frets and fumes against the Party Congress which is being convened by the Party commit-tees in Russia, declaring that “in acting the way they do,its participants place themselves outside the Party”. 
 Wequite understand the resentment of the group abroad, fromwhom the Party working in Russia has long since movedaway in actual fact and is now moving away also formally. 
 We also understand that only under the spur of resentment and despair can people argue so illogically and “deviatefrom the truth” as maladroitly as does the Council. 
 “Accord-ing to the Party Rules,” we are told, “the Congress can beconvened only by the Council. 
” Yes, except in those caseswhen the Council breaks these Rules and, instead of conven-ing the Congress, as it is in duty bound to do, fraudulently evades the issue. 
 Precisely such a “case” was proved longago by the Party against the Council (see Orlovsky’s The Council Against the Party , where he shows, among other things, that according to the “Council’s” arithmetic, 16 94 = 61!). 
 We are told further that on January 1, 1905, according to the unanimous decision of the Council (including Lenin’s vote) there were 33 qualified organisations besides the cen-tres. 
 That is not true. 
 The Party has long known, from thatpamphlet, that on January 1, 1905, the number of such or-ganisations was only 29. 
 The Kuban and Kazan committeesmentioned by Iskra were never approved by the Council, while the Polesye and North-Western committees were ap-proved only as of April 1, 1905. 
 This leaves 29 organisations(the committees of St. 
 Petersburg, Moscow, Tver, the North, Tula, Nizhni-Novgorod, Saratov, Ural-Ufa, Siberia, Don, Kharkov, Kiev, Odessa, Ekaterinoslav, Riga, Orel-Bryansk, Smolensk, Samara, Voronezh, the Caucasian Federation= 4 committees, Kursk, Astrakhan, Nikolayev, Crimea, theMining and Metal District, and the League). 
 The “Bureauof Committees of the Majority” maintains that it has beenauthorised by ten organisations, the Council further states. 
That is a lie. 
 The Bureau was elected, as everyone knows, before January 1, 1905, at three conferences, by 13 committees (6 Northern, 3 Southern, and 4 Caucasian). 
 After the Bureauannounced the convening of the Congress, the Voronezh andTula committees aligned themselves with it. 
 So that up toJanuary 1, 1905, out of the 28 qualified organisations inRussia, 15 declared for the Congress, in defiance of the Bonapartist centres. 
 This does not include the qualified organisations (the Saratov, Siberian, and other committees)which long ago declared themselves generally in favour ofthe Congress (see Shakhov’s pamphlet The Struggle for the Congress ). 
 How ludicrous and clumsy are the Council’s attempts to deceive the uninformed public, which learns of what is happening, not from documents, but from gossip abroad, is strikingly illustrated in the following two reports. 
In the very interesting pamphlet Report of the Geneva Meet-ing on September 2, 1904 , issued by the Minority, Dan ad-mits that the majority of the Party committees broke offall comradely relations with Iskra , while Plekhanov, a bit-ter opponent of the Majority, was compelled to declare thatthe forces of the warring camps were approximately equal!(This is the opinion of a resident abroad, mark you. 
) In Le-nin’s Statement *—which, far from being refuted by the Mi-nority, was openly acknowledged by Popov—no less a personthan an agent of the Central Committee admits that the Mi-nority has only four committees in Russia, and that at a real Party congress the Editorial Board and the Council are cer-tain to be removed from office. 
 Once more: whom are youtrying to fool, you heroes of co-optation? You are mortallyafraid of the only real Party solution—the Congress—whileat the same time you claim that your opponents are backed by a negligible fraction of the total number of organisations, *See present edition, Vol. 
 7, p.

— Ed. 
 only about a quarter at the most! In your fury you fail to see that you are castigating no one but yourselves. 
 Is Nicholas II, then, afraid of a Constituent Assembly because the ene-mies of tsarism constitute only a negligible fraction of thepeople? Vperyod , No. 
 10, Published according to March 15 (2), 1905 the text in Vperyod THE PROLETARIAT AND THE BOURGEOIS DEMOCRATS We have pointed out the unpardonable short-sightedness of the new-Iskrists’ view that moderate Russian liberalism has been dealt its death-blow * and that the vanguard role of the proletariat has been recognised by our democrats. 
On the contrary, the bourgeois democrats are striving morethan ever now to gain control of the working-class movement;more harmful now than ever, therefore, is Rabocheye Dyelo -ism, which the new-Iskrists are attempting to revive. 
 Here is an interesting leaflet which is being circulated in Russia and which offers valuable material on this question: “The bourgeoisie has lately shown a tendency towards organisation; but what is still more significant is that thebourgeois democrats are turning to the workers. 
 The demo-crats want to act as leaders of the proletariat’s economic and political struggle. 
 ‘By conviction,’ they say, ‘we are, strict-ly speaking, Social-Democrats; but Social-Democracy,owing to Party dissensions, does not grasp the importanceof the present moment and has failed to lead the working-class movement; this is where we want to step in. 
’ We learnfrom what they have to say further that these new ‘Social-Democrats at heart’ have not worked out any programme of their own but merely intend to explain things to the workersand answer their inquiries. 
 The literature is to meet the sameneeds and is by no means to bear a Party character. 
 And sothese ‘clean Social-Democrats’, dissatisfied with the tac-tics and the present behaviour of the Committee, have turned to the methods of ‘lending ear to the masses’, which history *See p. 
 170 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 has long ago rejected, to the methods of Economism of blessed memory. 
 Considering themselves to be Social-Democrats and the true spokesmen of working-class aspirations, these gentlemen do not understand or do not want to understandthat the working-class movement will achieve substantialresults only if it is led by a united working-class party,if the proletariat is conscious of its class distinctness and re-alises that its real emancipation lies in its own hands and not in the hands of the bourgeois democrats, who are discrediting the actions of the workers’ party. 
 These ‘strictly-speaking’Social-Democrats, alleged Marxists, ought to realise the de-moralisation they are bringing among the working-classmasses by seeking to prove that certain ‘democrats’ (but notSocial-Democrats) consisting exclusively of bourgeois intellectuals are called upon to show the workers the way to freedom and socialism. 
 “The last point, though, they seem to have entirely for-gotten in their absorption with politics of the day. 
 Littleby little they are carrying elements of opportunism into theworking-class movement. 
 The workers are not so keen now on founding a party of their own, relying as they do on the in-telligentsia. 
 Why, then, do these new friends of the workingclass allow and even encourage such things to happen?The ‘democrats’ themselves give a frank reply to this ques-tion. 
 ‘Our group used to work only among the intellectuals,’they say, ‘but recent events have compelled us to turn to the workers. 
’ “The democratic milk-skimmers, who call themselves Social-Democrats in ‘principle’, began to give their gra-cious attention to the proletarian movement only after themasses had come out into the streets and the blood of thou-sands of workers had stained the pavements. 
 Posing as the true friends of the working class, they pass by with a hypo-critical mien the work of decades, work which has createdand directed the revolutionary mood of the Russian prole-tariat and, at the cost of great sacrifices, brought into beingthe united Social-Democratic working-class party. 
 Ap-parently, these modernistic Social-Democrats have learned only one thing from the whole of Marxist doctrine (and that only recently), namely, that only the power of the organisedproletariat is capable of overthrowing autocratic tyranny and winning political freedom, the benefit of which will be derived mainly by the bourgeoisie. 
 The new friends of the pro-letariat are trying to saddle themselves upon the working-class movement and urge it on with the whip of immediateresults, to the shout, ‘Onward, to our freedom!’ How aptthe Russian proverb, God save us from our friends, fromour enemies we shall save ourselves.

 10, Published according to March 15 (2), 1905 the text in Vperyod THE PROLETARIAT AND THE PEASANTRY The peasant uprisings have begun. 
 Reports of peasants raiding landed estates and confiscating the landlords’ grainand cattle are coming in from various provinces. 
 The tsaristarmies, routed by the Japanese in Manchuria, are taking theirrevenge on the defenceless people, making expeditions against the enemy at home, against the rural poor. 
 The urban work-ing-class movement is acquiring a new ally in the revolu-tionary peasantry. 
 The attitude of the class-conscious van-guard of the proletariat, the Social-Democrats, towards thepeasant movement is becoming a question of immediate prac-tical significance and must be placed on the order of the day in all our Party organisations, in all speeches by propa-gandists and agitators. 
 The Social-Democrats have pointed out repeatedly that the peasant movement sets before them a twofold task. 
 Un-questionably we must support this movement and spur it on,inasmuch as it is a revolutionary-democratic movement. 
 At the same time we must unswervingly maintain our class pro-letarian point of view; we must organise the rural prole-tariat, like the urban proletariat and together with it, intoan independent class party; we must explain to it that itsinterests are antagonistic to those of the bourgeois peas-antry; we must call upon it to fight for the socialist revolu-tion, and point out to it that liberation from oppression and poverty lies, not in turning several sections of the peas-antry into petty bourgeois, but only in replacing the entirebourgeois system by the socialist system. 
 This twofold task of the Social-Democrats was often stressed in the old Iskra , beginning with issue No.

 before the first peasant movement of 1902; it found expres-sion in our Party programme; it was also repeated in our newspaper (issue No. 
 3 *). 
 Now, when it is particularly important to throw light on the practical aspects of thisproblem, it would be of interest to quote the remarks of KarlKautsky, who published an article entitled “The Peasantsand the Revolution in Russia” in the German Social-Demo-cratic journal, Die Neue Zeit . 
 As a Social-Democrat, Kautsky stoutly upholds the truth that the task facing our revolu-tion now is not that of effecting the socialist revolution but that of removing the political obstacles to the developmentof the existing, capitalist, mode of production. 
 He goes onto say: “On the question of the relations between peasantand landlord, the revolutionary urban movement should remain neutral. 
 It has no reason to step in between the peas-ants and the landlord, to champion the latter against theformer; its sympathies are wholly with the peasantry. 
 Butneither is it the task of the revolutionary urban movementto incite the peasants against the landlords, who in present-day Russia play an entirely different role from that, let us say, of the French feudal nobility in the days of the ancien régime . 
 Besides, even if they wished to, the urban revolu-tionaries could have very little influence on the relationsbetween the landlords and the peasants. 
 That is a matterthe landlords and the peasants must settle between them-selves. 
” For a correct understanding of Kautsky’s remarks, which, taken out of context, might create no little misun-derstanding, one must bear in mind also the following re-mark at the end of the article: “A victorious revolutionwould not have too much difficulty in using the large lati-fundia of the worst enemies of the revolution ... to improvethe conditions of the proletarians and the peasants. 
” The reader who carefully compares these statements of Kautsky will easily recognise in them the Social-Democraticpresentation of the question we have just outlined. 
 Certaininaccuracies and unclarities in Kautsky’s expressions canbe accounted for by the cursory nature of his remarks andhis insufficient acquaintance with the agrarian programme of Russian Social-Democracy. 
 The crux of the matter is that *See pp. 
 83-89 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 antagonism between the peasants and the landlords cannot, in all the exigencies of the Russian revolution, remain the same in all cases and under all circumstances. 
 Under certaincircumstances, in certain situations, this attitude must beone not only of sympathy, but of direct support, and not mere-ly support, but actual “incitement”. 
 Under other circum-stances, the attitude can and should be neutral. 
 Judging from what we have quoted, Kautsky has correctly grasped this double aspect of our task, in contrast, not only to our “Social-ists-Revolutionaries”, who are sunk completely in the vul-gar illusions of revolutionary democracy, but also to manySocial-Democrats, who, like Ryazanov or X, 74 have been seeking a “simple” solution of the problem, valid for all combinations. 
 The fundamental error of such Social-Demo-crats (and of all Socialists-Revolutionaries) is that they donot adhere to the class viewpoint, and that, in seeking auniversal solution of the problem in all its combinations,they forget the dual nature of the well-to-do and the middlepeasant. 
 They take into account, virtually, only two classes— either landlords and “peasant and working class”, or pro-prietors and proletarians. 
 Actually, however, there are threeclasses, all of which differ in their immediate and ultimateaims: the landlords, the well-to-do peasantry and partly themiddle peasantry, and, finally, the proletariat. 
 Actually,the task of the proletariat under these circumstances is nec-essarily twofold. 
 The entire difficulty of a Social-Democratic agrarian programme and agrarian policy in Russia lies indefining, as clearly and precisely as possible, the conditionsunder which the proletariat must observe neutrality andthe conditions under which support and “incitement” arenecessary. 
 There can be only one solution to this problem: with the peasant bourgeoisie against all manner of serfdom andagainst the serf-owning landlords; with the urban pro-letariat against the peasant bourgeoisie and every otherbourgeoisie—such is the “line” of the rural proletariatand of its ideologists, the Social-Democrats. 
 In other words: to support the peasantry and urge it on even to the point of seizing any seigniorial “property”, no matter how “sacred”,insofar as this peasantry acts in a revolutionary-democraticthe attitude of the revolutionary proletariat towards the manner; to be wary of the peasantry, to organise separately from it, to be ready to combat it, insofar as this peasantry acts in a reactionary or anti-proletarian manner. 
 Or, to put it still differently: aid to the peasant when his strugglewith the landlord contributes to the development and strength-ening of the democratic forces; neutrality towards thepeasant when his struggle with the landlord is merely a mat-ter of squaring accounts between two factions of the landown-ing class, a matter to which the proletariat and the demo-crats are indifferent. 
 Such an answer, of course, will not satisfy people who ap-proach the peasant question without well thought-out theo-retical views, who are intent on popular “revolutionary”slogans calculated for effect, and who do not understand the great and serious danger of revolutionary adventurism, par-ticularly in the sphere of the peasant question. 
 In regard tosuch people—of whom there are now a considerable numberamong us, such as the Socialists-Revolutionaries, with thedevelopment of the revolution and of the peasant movementpromising an increase in their ranks—the Social-Democrat must firmly uphold the standpoint of the class struggle against every kind of revolutionary vagueness; they mustcontrapose to revolutionary phrase-mongering the sober esti-mate of the heterogeneous elements in the peasantry. 
 Speak-ing practically and concretely, the following statementwill bring us nearest the truth: All opponents of Social-Democ-racy on the agrarian question fail to take into consideration the fact that in European Russia proper there is an entirestratum of well-to-do peasants (one and a half to two millionhouseholds out of a total of about ten million). 
 This stratumcontrols no less than half of all the implements of productionand all the property owned by the peasants. 
 It cannot exist without employing seasonal and day labourers. 
 It is certainly hostile to serfdom, to the landlords, and to the bureaucracy,and is capable of becoming democratic, but still more cer-tain is its hostility to the rural proletariat. 
 Any attempt inan agrarian programme or in an agrarian policy to tone downor ignore this class antagonism is a conscious or unconscious departure from the socialist point of view. 
 Between the rural proletariat and the peasant bourgeoisie lies the stratum of the middle peasantry, whose position contains features to be found in both of these antipodes. 
 The common features in the position of all these strata, of the peasantry as a whole, undoubtedly tend to make the entire peasant movement democratic, great as may be the evi-dences of non-class-consciousness and of reactionary sentimentin particular instances. 
 It is our task never to depart from theclass standpoint and to organise the closest possible unionbetween the urban and the rural proletariat. 
 It is our task to clarify for ourselves and for the people the real democratic and revolutionary content that lies in the general, albeit vague, striving towards “land and freedom”. 
 It is, therefore,our task to lend the most energetic support and impetus tothis striving, while at the same time preparing the elementsof socialist struggle in the countryside as well. 
 To determine clearly the practical attitude of the Social-Democratic working-class party towards the peasant move-ment, the Third Congress of our Party must adopt a resolu-tion calling for support to that movement. 
 The followingis the draft of such a resolution formulating the above views,which have repeatedly been amplified in Social-Democratic literature; it must now be discussed in the widest possible circle of Party functionaries: “The Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, as the party of the class-conscious proletariat, strives to bringabout the complete emancipation of all working people fromevery kind of exploitation, and supports every revolutionary movement against the present social and political system.

 11, Published according to March 23 (10), 1905 the text in Vperyod STREET FIGHTING75 (THE ADVICE OF A GENERAL OF THE COMMUNE) Editors ’ foreword : The article presented below is a trans-lation from the memoirs of Cluseret, a famous leader of the Paris Commune. 
 As is evident from the short biographical sketch here given, Cluseret based his considerations chiefly,though not exclusively, on the experience of the Parisstreet uprisings. 
 Moreover, he had in mind specifically a rev-olution of the proletariat against all propertied classes,whereas we in Russia are now experiencing a revolution which is largely a movement of the whole people against the government clique. 
 It goes without saying, therefore,that Cluseret’s original ideas should serve the Russian pro-letariat only as material for an independent analysis of theexperience of the West-European comrades with a view toits adaptation to our own conditions. 
 We believe it would be useful to acquaint the reader briefly with the author’s life, which is not devoid of interest. 
 Gustave-Paul Cluseret was born in Paris on June 13, 1823. 
 He studied at the Military School of Saint-Cyr, from whichhe graduated in 1843 as a second lieutenant. 
 In 1848, withthe rank of lieutenant, he took a very active part in suppress-ing the workers’ revolt in Paris (the June Days). 
 Within six hours he took eleven barricades and captured three banners. 
For this “heroic deed” he was awarded the Order of the Le-gion of Honour. 
 In 1855, now a captain, he fought in the Cri-mean campaign, and then retired. 
 He served under Garibaldiin Italy’s war of liberation. 
 In 1861 he went to America, where he fought in the Civil War against the slave states. 
 He was raised to the rank of general and (after the victory atCross Keys) was granted American citizenship. 
 He then returned to France. 
 In 1868 he received a prison term for his articles in the newspaper L’Art . 
 In Sainte-Pélagie prison he became connected with leaders of the International. 
 His sharp military criticisms in the newspapers resulted inhis deportation as an American citizen. 
 Upon the procla-mation of the Republic (September 4, 1870), he returnedto Paris and took part in the attempts at a revolt in Lyonsand in Marseilles. 
 On April 3, 1871, he was appointed Minis-ter of War of the Commune. 
 On April 16, he was elected a member of the Commune. 
 For surrendering Fort Issy he wasdismissed by the Commune and arrested, but he was acquittedby a court of honour. 
 After the fall of the Commune he escapedfrom France. 
 He was sentenced to death on August 30,1872, by the Court of Versailles. 
 After the amnesty of 1881 he returned to France and contributed to the newspapers La Commune and La Marseillaise . 
 He was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment for inciting the army to insubordina-tion and fled from France. 
 In the 1888 elections to the Cham-ber of Deputies he was a candidate of the RevolutionaryParty. 
 He waged a zealous campaign against parliamenta-rism and the “Clemencist” Radical Party. 
 In 1889 he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies by the second arrondis-sement of Toulon. 
 Belonged to the Socialist Labour group. 
 Wrote a book The Army and Democracy (1869) and two volumes of Memoirs (1887) dealing with the Commune.

 11, Published according to March 23 (10), 1905 the text in Vperyod THE FIRST STEP Knock, and it shall be opened unto you, we said after reading the Party Council’s resolution of March 10, 1905, in Iskra , No. 
 91. 
 No sooner had the news of the Council’s resolution of March 8, 1905, and our answer in issue No. 
 10 ofVperyod * reached Russia, than we find ourselves confronted with a remarkable new change of front on the part of theCouncil, a change for which we can only congratulate ourcomrades of the new Iskra with all our heart and wish them to take a further step in the same direction. 
 The Council’s resolution of March 10 addresses itself to the participants at the Third Party Congress that is being con-vened by the Russian Bureau, proposing that the Congressaccept the mediation of the German Party and of Bebeltowards restoring Party unity, and expresses the Council’s consent to send two representatives to the Congress for talks on implementing the idea of arbitration. 
 In taking this first step “ on the new path ”, the Council, of course, could not help employing some of its old methods;it could not help repeating an untruth, the inherent absurd-ity of which we exposed in Vperyod , No. 
 10, namely, that the Congress, which is being called by a majority of the Rus-sian committees, is not a Party Congress, but that “an insig-nificant group of Party members” wants “to force its deci-sions on the real majority of the Party”. 
 These ruses wouldbe pathetic were they not so ridiculous, and we should notcare to dwell on them again, all the more so since our at-tention now is naturally drawn to the new step taken by the *See pp.

— Ed. 
 Council, which at last (at long last!) has realised the impor-tance of the Party Congress as a means of resolving the Party crisis and has finally made the first, albeit feeble, timid, and inconsistent attempt—but still an attempt—to look atthings simply, to call a spade a spade, and to essay a path,a “new path”, for restoring Party unity by means of directtalks between the two sections of the Party that arose afterthe Second Congress. 
 Excellent! It should have been done long ago. 
 The party of the proletariat would have been spared many months ofexcruciating, senseless, drawn-out crisis and clandestinesplitting. 
 A slightly more serious and sincere desire to reck-on openly and frankly with the will of the Party function-aries working in Russia would have helped Russian Social-Democracy out of its temporary state of disintegration a full year ago. 
 Yes, a year ago, even sooner. 
 It was at the end of January 1904. 
 The Party Council met for the first time to discuss the new situation in the Partyand the Party crisis, with Plekhanov, Axelrod, Martov,Vasilyev, 76 and Lenin attending. 
 The last two, members of the Central Committee and adherents of the Majority, saw clearly that the Party had in fact already been split by the Minority and that the clandestine character of the split brought an unspeakable corruption into the Party and demor-alised it completely, in that it left one side free to employthe most reckless “brawling” methods, while the other side was in duty bound to abide by the general decisions. 
 The clandestine split of the Party (in its moral and political sig-nificance and in its moral and political consequences) standsto an open split approximately in the same relation as clan-destine adultery to open free love. 
 Thus, the above-mentioned Council members proposed a resolution (January 28, 1904), which was published in full by Shakhov ( The Struggle for the Congress , p. 
 81), in which the Bolsheviks , although outnumbered by their opponents both on the Editorial Board and in the Council, the highestParty body, were the first to raise their voice for peace inthe Party, in view of the crucial problems of the historic moment. 
 The Bolsheviks drew there a clear line between the necessary and inevitable ideological struggle, on theone hand, and the “mean brawling”, disorganisation, petty rivalry, boycott, etc. 
, on the other. 
 They asked the Party Council to call on all Party members to “sink their petty differences as quickly as possible and keep the ideological struggle once and for all within such limits as would notlead to breaches of the Rules and not hamper practical activ-ities and constructive work”. 
 We have so many Partymembers with short memories who like to speak of the Party’sindependent activity, but prefer idle gossip to a study of the documents bearing on our Party split, that we urgently recommend to all comrades desiring to have an understand-ing of Party affairs that they take a look at page 81 of thepamphlet The Struggle for the Congress . 
 The Mensheviks, of course, rejected the resolution pro-posed by Lenin and Vasilyev and adopted (Plekhanov, Mar-tov, and Axelrod) a resolution asking the Central Committee to “co-opt” the Mensheviks. 
 Since the Central Committee hadon November 26, 1903, agreed to co-opt two Mensheviks of its own choice, this resolution of the Council could onlymean that three definite individuals were being forced upon the C. 
C. 
 Now the entire Party knows from published docu-ments (Lenin’s Statement *) that it was because of these “three” that differences on points of principle were invented and a “mean brawling” was engaged in up to November 1904 . 
 In reply to the resolution on co-optation, Lenin and Vasilyev submitted a dissenting report (Shakhov, p. 
 84),which likewise we recommend to the uninformed and the forgetful to read for their own edification. 
 This report stated that these members of the C. 
C. 
 “positively and emphaticallyfail to see any honest and right way out of the present Partydissensions, any way of stopping this impermissible struggleover the composition of the centres other than the immediateconvocation of a Party congress”. 
 The Mensheviks, of course, are sabotaging the Congress. 
 No reminders that at the Congress compromises of all kindsare permissible, that otherwise the struggle will assume thesame revolting form as clandestine and mercenary love, pro-duce any effect on them. 
 Incidentally, while such tacticsmay be natural and understandable in the case of the Men-sheviks, seeing that they have decided not to be embarrassed *See present edition, Vol. 
 7, pp. 
 527-37. 
— Ed. 
 by “mercenary love”, in the case of the conciliator Plekhanov this is an enormous mistake, which has become obvious dur-ing the further progress of the crisis. 
 Now anybody and everybody sees, and knows from the facts (namely, from thefacts of Glebov 77 and Company’s subsequent behaviour) that had Plekhanov voted in January 1904 for a Congress,the Congress would have been convened very quickly andsuch an imposing conciliatory party would have been formed at the Congress that it would have given no preponderance whatever to either the Majority or the Minority. 
 At that time the Congress was not only likely to have been but wasbound to be a conciliatory congress. 
 We repeat, this is no mere conjecture, but a reflection that has been definitely confirmed by the subsequent course of events. 
 But Plekha-nov, too, preferred “mercenary love”, viz. 
, a clandestine split, to an attempt to talk things over directly and open-ly until a definite agreement would be achieved. 
 What do we see now? The Mensheviks have to accept, albeit timidly, inconsistently, and belatedly, the solutionproposed by the Bolsheviks. 
 The Bolsheviks stuck to their guns and succeeded in having the Congress called, rightly maintaining that if the two “better halves” are not destinedto go on “cohabiting”, they must part openly, and not hidethemselves like contemptible cowards. 
 Better late than never, of course, and we heartily welcome even this timid step taken by the Council, its readiness to send two “representatives”. 
 But we absolutely object to the timidity and inconsistency of this move. 
 Why do you wantto send to the Congress only two representatives from the Council abroad , gentlemen? Why not representatives from all Party organisations? The members of the Russian Bureau of Committees of the Majority have, as you know, invited everybody to the Congress, and have specially sent regis-tered letters to the Editorial Board, to the Council, and to theLeague. 
 Why this strange and inexplicable contradiction?On the one hand, when it came to securing a hypocritical peace with the three knights-errant of the Central Committee(in deliberate violation of the will of the Committees of the Majority) you did not rest content with sending “two repre-sentatives” from the Council, but canvassed all the committees and organisations of the Minority , as was openly stated in issue No. 
 83 of Iskra . 
 On the other hand, when it comes to securing real peace with the entire Party, you send for “di-rect talks” only two representatives, and those from the Council abroad alone. 
 Where are the Russian Mensheviks,with whom it is a hundred times more important for us tocome to terms than with a coterie of littérateurs ? Where are the workers , the members and spokesmen of the organi-sations—those very workers whom you incited against the Second Congress, and about whose independent activity you shouted so much? Where are Comrades Akimov and Brou-ckère, Makhov and Yegorov (or their friends and comrades-in-idea), who, quite consistently from their point of view,supported the Mensheviks without, however, compromisingthemselves, i. 
e. 
, without taking part in the co-optation squab-bles? Where are Comrade Krichevsky and the other former “Economists”, with whom you are supposed to have madepeace, as Plekhanov and many others have asserted in the newIskra ? Where is Comrade Ryazanov, your solidarity with whom on many points we can also understand, but who nev-ertheless refused to join the League, because it was a Men-shevik organisation ? Perhaps you will say that all these comrades have no cre-dentials? But then you yourselves write a letter to the Con-gress “ waiving all formalities ”! No, gentlemen, you will not satisfy us with half-meas-ures, nor can you butter our parsnips with fine words. 
 If you really want, speaking frankly and without “formalities”, to work together, in the ranks of a single organisation, thencome to the Congress , all of you , and invite all the comrade~ who are divided from us only in matters of ideology and not of co-optation. 
 Then reckon with the “good will of revolution-aries”, to which you so fatuously referred when trying to hide from the Congress, and which alone can positively and conclusively decide the fate of the whole Party represented at the Congress. 
 Then look for mediators capable of influencingthe “good will” of all members of the Congress . 
 We shall heartily welcome every such mediator. 
 Knock, and it shall be opened unto you.... 
 What we Bol-sheviks have achieved by our open struggle is that we have come very close to a possibly direct and unequivocal wayout of the crisis. 
 We have succeeded in getting the Congress. 
 We have succeeded in getting the Mensheviks to change over from the drill-sergeant methods of the Party Council that has been left without a party to a straightforward, open offer of direct negotiations. 
 Whether or not the Council will besensible and honest enough to take the second step along the“new path”, we are convinced in any case that we shall winthe complete victory of the Party principle over circle nar-rowness.

 11, Published according to March 23 (10), 1905 the text in Vperyod ON THE HISTORY OF THE PARTY PROGRAMME78 By insisting that the draft programme was not written by me, Plekhanov is the first to carry our disputes overthe matter into the open in the form of insinuations, rebukes, and reproaches. 
 Unfortunately, he does not expound these disputes, but confines himself to gossip—to a statement,which though it may be piquant, is vague and unverifiable. 
Therefore, to my colleague’s article against Plekhanov Imust add that I have documentary evidence concerning ourdisputes during the discussion of the draft programme and that I shall publish this evidence when occasion offers. 
 The readers will then see: (1) that Plekhanov’s assertionthat our relations cooled on account of What Is To Be Done? is absolutely untrue; they cooled because the Board of six,in the dispute over the programme, split into two halves;(2) that I advocated the thesis of the displacement of small-scale industry by large-scale industry and had it included in the programme. 
 Plekhanov sought to confine himself toa nebulous expression in the nature of the famous “more orless”; (3) that I advocated and secured the substitution of theterm “proletariat” for that of “toiling and exploited masses”in the passage dealing with the class character of our Par-ty; and (4) that Plekhanov, when my adherents and I among the six on the Board criticised him for the fact that in hisdraft the proletarian character of our Party had not beenbrought out with sufficient clarity, parried with the counter-charge that I understood the proletarian character of theParty the way Martynov does.

 11, Published according to March 23 (10), 1905 the text in Vperyod ON OUR AGRARIAN PROGRAMME (A LETTER TO THE THIRD CONGRESS) The new peasant movement, which is daily growing and gathering strength, is again forcing the question of our agrar-ian programme to the fore. 
 The basic principle underlying this programme cannot, of course, give rise to differences ofopinion and discussions. 
 The party of the proletariat mustsupport the movement of the peasantry. 
 It will never defendthe present system of landlordism against the revolutionaryonset of the peasantry, but at the same time it will always strive to develop the class struggle in the countryside and to introduce political consciousness into this struggle. 
 Theseprinciples, I believe, are shared by all Social-Democrats. 
Opinion is divided only when it comes to putting the prin-ciples into practice, when it comes to formulating them ina programme to meet the tasks of the moment. 
 Reality is the best arbiter of all theoretical differences, and I am confident that the rapid march of revolutionaryevents will eliminate also these differences on the agrarianquestion in the Social-Democratic movement. 
 Hardly any-one will deny that it is not our business to indulge in project-mongering for all manner of land-reform schemes, or that we must strengthen the ties with the proletariat and support the peasant movement, without however losing sight of thepossessive tendencies of the peasant proprietor—tendencieswhose antagonism to the proletariat will be all the morerapidly and sharply revealed the more rapidly the revolu-tion advances. 
 On the other hand, the present revolutionary moment plainly calls for a thoroughly definite and concrete slogan. 
The formation of revolutionary peasant committees must become that slogan, and our Party’s agrarian programme has quite correctly advanced it. 
 There is a great amount of igno-rance and backwardness in the peasant movement, and it would be extremely dangerous to cherish any illusions onthat score. 
 The ignorance of the peasant is revealed, first ofall, in his failure to perceive the political aspect of the move-ment, to perceive, for instance, that without radical demo-cratic changes in the entire political structure of the entire state it is absolutely impossible to make any lasting prog-ress in the direction of extending the ownership of the land. 
The peasant needs land, and his revolutionary feeling, hisinstinctive, primitive sense of democracy cannot express itself otherwise than by laying hands on the landlords’ land. 
No one will attempt to dispute this, of course. 
 The Social-ists-Revolutionaries let it go at that instead of analysing these vague aspirations of the peasantry from the class pointof view. 
 The Social-Democrats maintain, on the basis of suchan analysis, that it is scarcely possible for the entire peasant-ry to go solid on any issue beyond the demand for the returnof the cut-off lands, for when the limits of such an agrarian reform are exceeded, the antagonism between the rural pro-letariat and the “enterprising muzhiks” will inevitably assertitself more sharply than ever. 
 The Social-Democrats, of course,can have no objection to the insurgent muzhik’s “dealingthe landlord the final blow” and to his taking all his land away from him, but they cannot embark on adventurism in a proletarian programme, they cannot let the class struggle against the property-owners be obscured by roseate prospectsof such changes in the landowning system (even though thesechanges may be democratic) as would merely reshuffle the classes or categories of property-owners. 
 Until now our programme contained the demand for the return of the cut-off lands, while the various commentaries on the programme pointed out that the cut-off lands are nota barrier, but “a door leading farther ” *, and that the proletariat would gladly support the peasantry in this fur-ther advance, while having to keep a watchful eye onits temporary ally, the peasant proprietor, lest he *To the Rural Poor , first published in pamphlet form, Geneva,79 May 1903. 
 See present edition, Vol. 
 6, p.

— Ed. 
 show his proprietary teeth. 
 Now, in face of the revolution-ary events, the question naturally arises whether it would not be more appropriate to transfer such a statement of our tactics from the commentaries to the programme proper. 
 Afterall, the programme is the official general Party expressionof the views of Social-Democracy, whereas a commentarynecessarily represents the more or less personal viewsof this or that Social-Democrat. 
 Would it not, therefore, be wiser to put into the programme a more general statement of our policy on this question, and leave it to the commen-taries to elaborate on specific measures and separate demands,as, for instance, the cut-off lands? To clarify my idea, I shall state here how the correspond-ing place in our programme ought to be formulated: (The R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 demands above all) ... “(4) the formation of rev-olutionary peasant committees for the purpose of elimi-nating all remnants of the serf-owning system, transformingall rural relations in general along democratic lines, takingrevolutionary measures to improve the lot of the peasantry,even to the extent of taking the land away from the landlords. 
 Social-Democracy will back the peasantry in all its revolu-tionary-democratic undertakings, while at the same timedefending the independent interests and the independentorganisation of the rural proletariat. 
” The proposed formulation introduces into the programme what has hitherto usually been elaborated in the commentar-ies and transfers the cut-off lands from the programme to them. 
 Such a change has the advantage of bringing out moreclearly in the programme the specific, independent characterof the proletarian position; and clarity on such an importantissue outweighs all editorial inconveniences (such as theinclusion in the programme of an explanation usually placed in the commentaries, instead of a definite demand; we might mention, incidentally, that our programme containssuch explanations: compare, for instance, the clause on com-bating reforms that tend to consolidate the tutelage of thepolice and the bureaucracy). 
 80 Another advantage is that the programme quashes once and for all the absurd idea alleg-ing that the Social-Democrats tell the peasants they cannot and must not go beyond the cut-off lands. 
 We must dispelthis idea by a clear formulation in the programme, and not confine ourselves to explaining it in the commentaries. 
 The tact that no concrete methods for expropriating the land are mentioned in the proposed formulation may appear to be a defect. 
 But is it, strictly speaking, a defect? Social-Democrats who have written on the agrarian ques-tion have pointed out repeatedly how inappropriate it isfor us to occupy ourselves with project-mongering in thisconnection, since the chief measure of an agrarian reform— nationalisation of the land—would, in a police-ridden state , necessarily be perverted and would serve only to ob-scure the class nature of the movement. 
 Yet all other meas-ures for transforming agrarian relations will, under the capi-talist system, be only an approach to nationalisation; theywill be only partial measures, only a few of the possible meas-ures, i. 
e. 
, measures to which Social-Democracy has no in-tention whatever of restricting itself . 
 At the present time the Social-Democrats are against nationalisation, and eventhe Socialists-Revolutionaries, under the influence of ourcriticism, have become much more cautious on the subject(compare their draft programme with their former “élan”). 
 But the point is that the revolutionary movement leads us towards the democratic republic, which, with the aboli-tion of the standing army, etc. 
, constitutes one of our imme-diate demands. 
 In a democratic republic, with the people armed and with other measures of a like republican character realised, Social-Democracy cannot renounce nationalisation of theland and thereby tie their own hands on this issue. 
 Thus, thedefect in the formulation I propose is only an apparent one. 
In point of fact, this formulation provides a consistentclass slogan for the present moment—indeed, an absolutely concrete slogan—while leaving ample scope for the “revo-lutionary-democratic” measures which may prove necessaryor desirable in the event of a favourable development of ourrevolution. 
 At the present time, as well as in the future, pend-ing the complete victory of the peasant uprising, a revo-lutionary slogan must necessarily take into account the antag-onism between peasant and landlord ; and the cut-off lands clause quite correctly emphasised this circumstance. 
 On theother hand, all and every “nationalisation”, “transfer of rents”, “socialisation”, etc. 
, ignore and obscure this characteristic antagonism, and therein lies their defect. 
 At the same time, the formulation I propose widens the aims of the revolutionary peasant committees to include“transforming all rural relations in general along democrat-ic lines”. 
 The peasant committees are presented as a sloganin our programme, which correctly characterises them aspeasant , i. 
e. 
, social-estate, in essence, since oppression of one social-estate by another can be destroyed only by the whole of the lower, oppressed estate. 
 But is there any reasonfor confining the aims of these committees to agrarian re-forms? Must other committees really be set up for other, e. 
g. 
, administrative, reforms? The trouble with the peasants,as I have previously pointed out, is their utter failure to perceive the political aspect of the movement. 
 If we could succeed, even in a few instances, in connecting the effectiverevolutionary measures taken by the peasantry to improvetheir position (confiscation of grain, of livestock, and of land ) with the formation and activity of peasant committees and with the full sanctioning of these committees by the revolu-tionary parties (and, under especially favourable condi-tions, by a provisional revolutionary government), we couldconsider the struggle to win the peasants for the demo-cratic republic as won. 
 Unless the peasantry is thus wonover, all its revolutionary steps will be very insecure, andall its gains will easily be wrested from it by the social classes in power. 
 Finally, in speaking of supporting “revolutionary-demo-cratic” measures, the proposed formulation draws a clearline between the deceptive, pseudo-socialist appearance o f such measures as the peasant seizure of land and their actualdemocratic content. 
 To realise how important it is for a Social-Democrat to draw such a line, it suffices to recall the attitude of Marx and Engels towards the agrarian movement,for instance, in America (Marx in 1848 on Kriege, 81 Engels in 1885 on Henry George82). 
 Today, of course, no one will attempt to deny the existence of a peasant war for land, of the land fever (in semi-feudal countries or in the colonies). 
 We fully recognise its legitimacy and its progressiveness, but at the same time we reveal its democratic, i. 
e. 
, in the final analysis , its bourgeois-democratic content. 
 Therefore, while endorsing this content, we, for our part, make special “reservations”; we point to the “independent” role of the pro-letarian democratic movement and to the specific aims of the Social-Democratic Party as a class party that is workingfor the socialist revolution. 
 These are the reasons that lead me to suggest that the com-rades discuss my proposal at the forthcoming Congress andbroaden the corresponding clause of the programme in the direction I propose.

 12, Published according to March 29 (16), 1905 the text in Vperyod [signed]— WHAT THE BONAPARTISTS ARE UP TO Geneva, March 29 (16) We have just received the following report from Tver: “A periphery meeting held jointly with the Committee on March 9, and attended by a representative of the CentralCommittee, discussed the question of the attitude to theThird Party Congress which is being convened by the C. 
C. 
(appeal to the Party dated March 4, 1905). 
 The resolution ofthe Tver Committee was read out: ‘The Tver Committee welcomes the call of the Central Committee of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 to prepare for the Third Party Congress (resolution of theC. 
C. 
 dated March 4, 1905) and it has resolved at its meetingto participate in the Congress by sending a delegate. 
 In view,however, of the statement made by the Tver Committee toa representative of the Organising Bureau about participat-ing in the Congress organised by that Bureau, the Tver Committee feels obligated to point out that this statementwas made in response to the Bureau representative’s * assur-ance of the C. 
C. 
 decision to make the Congress then in prep-aration a regular one. 
’” The periphery meeting did not support the resolution of the Tver Committee. 
 The following resolution was adopted *The representative of the Bureau of Committees of the Majori-ty, who made the report on the Third Congress at a meeting of the Tvercommittee and the periphery in February, informs us that this asser-tion of the Tver Committee is “inaccurate”. 
 “I told them, he declares“according to the direct statement of C. 
C. 
 member Nikitich, 83 that the C. 
C. 
 had intended to announce the Third Congress, thus making the Congress convened by the Bureau a regular congress by agreement,but that it had not had time for various reasons to enter into official negotiations with the Bureau on the question. 
” by a majority of seven votes to one with one abstention: “Having at last received the call of the Central Committee to prepare for the immediate convocation of the Third Con-gress, and welcoming this act of the C. 
C. 
, we declare that wehave already decided to take part in the Party Congress that is being convened by the Organising Bureau. 
 We consider itpossible to avail ourselves of the offer made by the C. 
C. 
 inits appeal ‘To the Party’ dated March 4 only on the condition that a formal agreement is reached between the C. 
C. 
 and the Organising Bureau” (6 for, 3 against). 
 To note the moodof the other three comrades, who voted in the negative, Icite the other resolution, offered by two of the comrades whothus voted: “The local organisation welcomes the decision ofthe Central Committee to convene a Third Party Congress and strongly urges it and the Organising Bureau to come to an agreement between themselves. 
 Should an agreement noteventuate, the local organisation leaves itself a free hand. 
” It follows from this report that: (1) the Tver Committee, together with the periphery, had declared, according to theCommittee’s own admission, its consent to participate in the Congress organised by the Bureau of Committees of the Majority; (2) subsequently, the Tver Committee, under theinfluence of the C. 
C. 
’s new promises to convene the ThirdCongress, withdrew its consent. 
 The periphery, however,did not support the Committee and did not decline to partic-ipate in the Congress which the Bureau had called; (3) the C. 
C. 
’s new promises to convene the Third Congress were given in the appeal “To the Party, dated March 4, 1905”, whichhas so far remained unpublished and is unknown to us. 
 To appraise the behaviour of our famous C. 
C. 
 at its true worth, we would remind our comrades, first, of the PartyRules, and secondly, of certain facts. 
 According to the Rules a congress is convened by the Council , and not by the Central Committee. 
 Consequently, the C. 
C. 
 is giving promises itcannot live up to. 
 It promises to do what, under the Rules,it cannot do. 
 The C. 
C. 
 promises or proposes, but the Coun-cil disposes. 
 As for those members of the Party who arenaïve enough to lend an ear to the C. 
C. 
’s promises and are unfamiliar with the Rules, they find themselves in the posi-tion of dupes. 
 How the Council “disposes” the facts reveal. 
In its resolution of March 8 (new style) the Council declares (Iskra , No. 
 89) that “ with the assent of the majority of the Party workers ” (perhaps including the Tver Committee?) “ it considers it inexpedient to convene the Party Congress at such a moment ”. 
 Can anything be clearer? Does this not show that the Council, time and again, is shamelessly deceivingthe Party, since it never did have the “assent” of the “majorityof Party workers”? Further, on March 10 (N. 
S. 
), that is, two days later, the Council adopted another resolution ( Iskra , No. 
 91) agreeing to send two representatives to the Congress convened by theRussian Bureau of Committees of the Majority, but saying not a word about agreeing to the convening of the Congress . 
 We would add that the Council not only takes a position officially against the “expediency” of convening the Congress but rigs the votes to the Congress by increasing the number of allegedly qualified committees and refusing to inform theParty which new committees it considers to be accreditedand when they were accredited. 
 In the resolution of the Coun-cil of March 8 (discussed in Vperyod , No. 
 10 *), the commit-tees considered qualified as of January 1, 1905, were those of Polesye, the North-West, Kuban, and Kazan, whereas the last two committees were not accredited at all by the C. 
C. 
and the former will not be qualified until April 1, 1905. 
 We ask the Party members who wish to be real and not just registered members whether they are going to stand forthis game. 
 The Council rigs the votes and declares against the Congress, while the C. 
C. 
 gives “promises” as regards the Congress, taking advantage of the naïveté of people whodo not know that according to the Rules these promises can have no formal weight. 
 Do not the facts wholly confirm what we wrote on February 28 (15) in Vperyod , No. 
 8, at the first reports of the C. 
C. 
’s “assent” to the Congress? We would remark that a month has passed since then, that Iskra has since issued Nos. 
 88, 89, 90, 91, and 92 (dated March 10, O. 
S. 
)without saying a word on this “ticklish” question of the C. 
C. 
’s “assent” to the Congress. 
 We can only repeat what wesaid in Vperyod , No. 
 8: “We have just received a report that can be interpreted to mean that the Central Committee agrees to an immediate congress. 
 We can in no *See pp. 
 225-27 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 way vouch for the authenticity of the report at the present moment, but we consider it probable. 
 The C. 
C. 
 has campaigned against the Con-gress for many months; it has cashiered the organisations and boycottedand disorganised the committees that have declared for the Congress. 
 These tactics have failed. 
 Now, following the rule ‘expediency is everything, formality is nothing’, the C. 
C. 
, for the sake of ‘expediency’(that is , for the sake of preventing the Congress ) is prepared formally to declare a hundred times if need be that it is for the immediate convo-cation of the Congress. 
 We hope that neither the Bureau nor the localcommittees will let themselves be deceived by the subterfuges of the Party’s ‘Shidlovsky Commission’.

 We are obliged to keep a regular diary of the C.

 “Since the success of an all-Party congress and its speedy convocation depend on the unanimous collaboration of the utmost possible number of all comrades and organisationsthat are declaring n o w for the Congress, the C.

” Infinite indeed is the long-suffering patience of the Rus-sian committees and their credulity! Why does not theC.

 publish its appeal of March 4? Why does it mouth menda-cious phrases about an “agreement” with the Bureau? The Bureau invited everyone to the Congress without exception, the entire Party ; it did so over a month ago openly and pub-licly. 
 The Bureau answered the C. 
C. 
 long since that no delays were now possible . 
 Everyone who wants an all-Party congress not merely in words is invited; it’s as clear as that. 
 Besides,what sense would there be in an agreement between the Bu-reau and the C.

 Published at the end of March 1905 Published according to as a reprint from No. 
 13 of Vperyod the text of the reprint A REVOLUTION OF THE 1789 OR THE 1848 TYPE? An important question in connection with the Russian revolution is the following: I. 
 Will it go on to the complete overthrow of the tsarist government and the establishment of a republic? II. 
 Or will it limit itself to a curtailment of tsarist power, to a monarchist constitution? In other words, are we to have a revolution of the 1789 type or of the 1848 type? * (We say type in order to dispose of the preposterous idea that there can be any repetition of the irrevocably vanished social, political, and international situations of 1789 and 1848. 
) That a Social-Democrat must want and w o r k f o r the former, of this there can hardly be any doubt. 
 Yet Martynov’s way of stating the issue reduces itself wholly to a tail-ender’s desire for a more modest revolution. 
 In type II the “danger”, so frightening to the Martynovs, of the proletariat and the peasantry seizing power is entirelyeliminated. 
 In this case Social-Democracy will unavoidablyremain “in opposition”— even to the revolution ; this indeed is what Martynov wants—to remain in opposition even tothe revolution. 
 The question is, which type is the more probable? In favour of type I we have: (1) An immeasurably greater store of resentment and revolutionary feeling among thelower classes in Russia than there was in the Germany of1848. 
 With us the change is sharper ; with us there have been *N. 
 B. 
 Some might add here “or of the 1871 type”? This question must be considered as a probable objection raised against us by many non-Social-Democrats. 
 no intermediate stages between autocracy and political free-dom (the Zemstvo does not count); with us despotism is Asi-atically virginal. 
 (2) With us a disastrous war increases the likelihood of a severe collapse, for it has involved the tsarist government completely. 
 (3) With us the international sit-uation is more favourable, for proletarian Europe will makeit impossible for the crowned heads of Europe to help theRussian monarchy. 
 (4) With us the development of class-conscious revolutionary parties, their literature and organi-sation, is on a much higher level than it was in 1789, 1848,or 1871. 
 (5) With us the various nationalities oppressed bytsarism, such as the Poles and Finns, provide a powerful im-pulse to the attack on the autocracy. 
 (6) With us the peasant-ry is in particularly sorry plight; it is incredibly impover-ished and has absolutely nothing to lose. 
 Of course, all these considerations are by far not absolute. 
 Others may be contraposed to them: (1) We have very fewsurvivals of feudalism. 
 (2) The government is more experi-enced and has greater facilities for detecting the danger of rev-olution. 
 (3) The spontaneity of a revolutionary outburst is complicated by the war, which creates problems that have no bearing on the revolution. 
 The war demonstrates the weak-ness of the Russian revolutionary classes, which would nothave had the strength to rise without it (cf. 
 Karl Kautskyin The Social Revolution ). 
 (4) Other countries provide no stimulus to a revolution in ours. 
 (5) The national movements towards the dismemberment of Russia are likely to tear the bulk of the Russian big and petty bourgeoisie away from ourrevolution. 
 (6) The antagonism between the proletariat andthe bourgeoisie with us is much deeper than it was in 1789,1848, or 1871; hence, the bourgeoisie will be more fearful ofthe proletarian revolution and will throw itself more readily into the arms of reaction. 
 Only history, of course, can weigh these pros and cons in the balances. 
 Our task as Social-Democrats is to drive the bourgeois revolution onward as far as it will go, withoutever losing sight of our main task—the independent organisation of the proletariat. 
 This is where Martynov gets muddled. 
 The complete rev-olution means seizure of power by the proletariat and thepoor peasantry. 
 These classes , once in power, cannot but /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR strive for the socialist revolution. 
 Ergo , seizure of power, from being at first a step in the democratic revolution, will, by force of circumstances, and against the will (and sometimes without the awareness) of its participants, p a s s i n t o the socialist revolution. 
 And here failure is inevitable . 
 If attempts at the socialist revolution are bound to end in failure, wemust (like Marx in 1871, when he foresaw the inevitablefailure of the insurrection in Paris) advise the proletariat not to rise , but to wait and organise, reculer pour mieux sauter . 
 * Such, in substance, is Martynov’s idea (and that of the new Iskra , too), had he been able to reason it out to its logical end.

 TO THE PARTY Comrades, you all know what a distressing crisis our Par-ty has been passing through these past eighteen months andmore. 
 Ever since the Second Party Congress, owing to a se-ries of deplorable circumstances, the central bodies of our Party abroad—the Editorial Board of the Central Organand the Council—have come under the control of the adher-ents of the Party Congress Minority. 
 The dissatisfactionamong our Party workers continued to grow and developedinto a concealed, intense struggle, which seriously hampered the entire activity of Social-Democracy and impaired the prestige of the proletarian party. 
 Seeing the harm this secretsplit was causing, the Party committees began to demand theconvening of the Third Congress as the only party way outof the crisis. 
 The struggle for the Congress has been the vi-talising breath of the Party activities since the spring of 1904. 
 The Party Council abroad opposed the idea of the Con-gress in every way it could. 
 The Central Committee soughtto meet the demands of the Minority in the matter of co-op-tation in the hope thereby to restore peace within the Party. 
But this hope was dashed. 
 Instead of peace being restored,the struggle was intensified. 
 The ensuing great events in the development of the work-ing-class movement and the revolution in Russia, theevents of January 9 and its aftereffects, created a new situa-tion which taxed the Party’s powers and energies still more. 
For the overwhelming majority of the Party workers inRussia the Congress became a pressing need. 
 The resistance of the Council abroad resulted in the election by a number of committees in Russia of a special Bureau for conveningthe Party Congress. 
 Under the circumstances the C. 
C. 
 deemed it its party duty to join the Bureau of Committees of the Majority for the immediate convening of the Party Congress. 
 The need for the Congress, even from a narrow formal point of view, is borne out by the following. 
 The membersof the Party learned from issue No. 
 89 of Iskra that, apart from the central bodies, the Party Council considered 33 or-ganisations qualified. 
 Consequently, even on this count (disputed by a large number of Party workers, who set the number of Party organisations at 31) 38 votes were re-quired to make the convocation of the Congress obligatory(3392 =66; 66 &9=75; 75 : 2 =372). 
 The thirteen committees that elected the Bureau of Com-mittees of the Majority have long since declared for the Congress. 
 The 13 have been joined by the committees of the Urals, Tula, Voronezh, Samara, the North-West, Smolensk,Kharkov, and Kazan, i. 
e. 
, by 8 committees. 
 These 21 com-mittees, together with the four votes of the C. 
C. 
 (two votesof the C. 
C. 
 itself and two of its delegates on the Council),give 42 &4 =46 votes. 
 Written at the end of March-beginning of April 1905 First published in 1931 Published according to in Lenin Miscellany XVI the manuscript THE SECOND STEP In issue No. 
 11 of Vperyod we hailed the first step of the Party Council which was left without a party. 
 * We asked ourselves whether the Council would have the sense and hon-esty to make the second step along its new path. 
 Now we have just received news from Russia that the Central Commit-tee has made the second step . 
 We are able to publish immedi-ately the following documents in the case. 
 1) Appeal of the Central Committee to the Party of March 4, 1905. 
 T o t h e P a r t y Comrades, the revolution in Russia has begun! Its prelude has proved in the most incontrovertible manner that the principal force deciding its outcome is the urban proletariat. 
 However, in the matter ofspeeding the issue of the revolution, of bringing system into the revo-lutionary struggle of the masses, and, especially, of turning the results of the revolution to the fullest account in favour of the proletariat, agreat deal depends on the actual state of our Party’s forces and its or-ganisation. 
 History has imposed upon our Party the political and moral responsibility towards the Russian proletariat, towards ourwhole nation, and, lastly, towards the proletariat the world over. 
 In its present state our Party is not capable of fulfilling its obligations to the extent necessary and possible, considering the potential strengthof Russian Social-Democracy. 
 The C. 
C. 
 deems it untimely and useless at the present juncture to prove, chapter and verse, whether and to what extent certain prominent Party members, influential groups, andentire Party bodies were guided in their inner-Party activities by pro-found political motives or by intellectualist politicking, in short, without trying to apportion the blame for the deep-going disorganisa-tion of the Party, the C. 
C. 
, fully realising the weight of the responsibil-ity that rests upon it, declares before the whole Party that it has firm-ly decided to do everything in its power to ensure necessary unity inthe Party and prevent a final split. 
 The development of the revolution Ed confronts Russian Social-Democracy almost daily with new problems. 
 Many of these issues have barely been touched upon by our tactics, which were evolved chiefly for “peace-time” use. 
 Others have no prec-edent whatever in former Party practice, since they have arisen fromnew causes which never existed before. 
 Party literature, of course, is a help, but its answers do not always satisfy local workers as regards adequacy, unity, and generally recognised competence. 
 Quite recentlya considerable number of committees, which united after private meet-ings, have adopted a policy of distrust towards the central bodies of the Party, existing by virtue of the Party Rules adopted at the SecondCongress of the Party, and have carried this policy to the extent of form-ing their own organ and their own centre, and are at present engaged in convening their own congress. 
 Finally, the time set by the Party Rulesfor convening the Third regular Congress falls due this summer. 
 Under the circumstances the C. 
C considers that the only and final means of avoiding a split is the convening of the all-Party Congress in the very near future . 
 Convinced that the useful results of the Congress, in the sense both of dealing with the vital tasks that the present political situation hasput before our Party and of achieving real, lasting unity in the Party, will depend entirely on the broad and full representation of all the important and influential currents at the Congress, the C. 
C. 
, in pur-suance of the Rules, has decided, in the interests of fuller representa-tion, to make wide use of its right to invite to the Congress comrades with consultative voice. 
 In view of the fact that the dissensions whichhave been rending the Party have led in some places to a complete break-away of major groups from the committees, and in others to sharp antagonism between committees and peripheries, the C. 
C. 
 invites thefollowing bodies to send their own delegates to the Congress with con-sultative voice: (1) all groups that broke away from the committees prior to March 1, 1905; (2) all peripheries of large industrial centres inwhich there are 20,000 workers or over in the area of the committee’s activity and where over half the periphery members vote no confidence in the local committee on the question of the election of a delegateto the Congress. 
 Note . 
 The C. 
C. 
 proposes that for this purpose only those comrades shall be considered members of the periphery who belong to a committeeorganisation and engage in active revolutionary work under the direc-tion and control of the committee, such as propaganda, agitation, or-ganisation, and the writing, printing, and distribution of literature. 
Moreover, since the all-Party Congress, according to the Rules, is con-vened by the Party Council, the C. 
C. 
, while calling upon the local com-mittees to declare for the Third Congress as the only means now ofensuring Party unity, will, for its part, support its decision for the im-mediate convocation of the Congress through its representatives on the Party Council, and will straight away take a number of practical pre-paratory steps. 
 In addition, the C. 
C. 
 declares that it will do everything in its power to enlist to the business of convening the Congress the “Organising Bureau” set up for that purpose on the initiative of severalof the committees; the preparatory work of this Bureau may help to Note . 
 The details of enlisting the services of the “Organising Bureau” of committees of the so-called “Majority” for the work of convening theCongress should be worked out by mutual agreement. 
 Viewing theimmediate convocation of the all-Party Congress as the last means of avoiding a split and creating real unity of the Party, which alone can give us the necessary strength to tackle the great tasks confrontingRussian Social-Democracy, the Central Committee calls upon allmembers of the Party to make the most energetic preparations for theCongress which must urgently be held.

 On March 4 the Central Committee decided to call upon the commit-tees of the Party to prepare for the Third Congress, and for its part it decided to take steps for convening the Congress at the earliest possibledate. 
 Since the success of the all-Party Congress and its convocation at the earliest possible date depend on the co-operation of all the comradesand organisations now declaring for the Congress, the C.

 proposes to the Organising Bureau of Committees of the so-called “Majority” to enter into an agreement on this matter and work together for conven-ing the Congress at the earliest and for ensuring the fullest possiblerepresentation at the Congress of the whole Party.

 March 6, 1905 3) Joint appeal to the Party by the C. 
C. 
 and the Bureau of Committees of the Majority, dated March 12, 1905. 
 T o t h e P a r t y The Central Committee and the Bureau of Committees of the Major-ity have taken upon themselves the initiative for convening the ThirdCongress of the Party and notify all Party organisations that, proceed-ing from the urgent need for immediately holding the Third PartyCongress to establish the general line of Party tactics and the Party’sorganisational unity, they have come to an agreement for the joint or-ganisation of the Congress on the following basis: 1) The Congress is to be convened on the basis of the programmes set forth in the declarations of the Central Committee and the Bureau ofCommittees of the Majority; these programmes provide for the follow-ing agenda: (a) Constitution of the Congress; (b) questions of Party tactics; (c) questions of Party organisation: (1) organisation of the centres, (2) organisation of the committees, (3) relations between the variousParty bodies and their divisions; (d) reports; (e) elections. 
 2) All Party organisations having the right to participate with a vote under the Rules of the Second Congress are invited to the Congress(viz. 
, the four Caucasian committees, the Moscow, St. 
 PetersburgTver, Tula, Nizhni-Novgorod, Northern, Kiev, Odessa, Ekaterinoslav, Kharkov, Don Region, Voronezh, Nikolayev, Saratov, Samara, North-Western, Polesye, and the Astrakhan committees, and the League;the Donets, Crimean, Urals, and Siberian leagues) *; all the rest are invited to participate with consultative voice. 
 3) The organising work in connection with the convening of the Third Party Congress so far carried out by the Bureau of Committees of the Majority is herewith endorsed. 
 4) All further work in connection with convening the Congress is to be carried out jointly by the Bureau of Committees of the Majorityand the Central Committee, which form an Organising Committee. 
 5) The resolution of the Party Council against convening the Third Party Congress published in Iskra , No. 
 89, is not accepted by the Cent-ral Committee and the Bureau of Committees of the Majority as grounds for suspending work on organising the Congress. 
 March 12, 1905 The agreement between the Central Committee and the Bureau of Committees of the Majority of March 12, 1905,is for the time being not to be made public. 
 * * * We can thus celebrate a complete moral victory. 
 Russia has gained the upper hand over the “foreigners”. 
 The Partyspirit has triumphed over circle parochialism. 
 At the lastminute the Central Committee saw that the Congress whichwas being convened by the Bureau of Committees of the Ma-jority was a real Party congress and joined it. 
 The Central Committee at the eleventh hour had courage enough to aban-don its anti-Party policy and to defy the Council abroad. 
According to the Rules of our Party the Congress is con-vened by the Council and not by the Central Committee. 
 Con-sequently, legally speaking, no statements or agreementson this question by the Central Committee are valid. 
 But when the Council violated the Rules and avoided rendering an account to a congress, it was the duty and not only theright of the committees to take the initiative in convening *With reference to the Riga, Smolensk, Kursk Orel-Bryansk Kazan, Kremenchug, Elisavetgrad, and Kuban committees, see Point3 of the agreement between the Central Committee and the Bureau ofCommittees of the Majority. 
 the Congress; and the Central Committee, by recognising the Bureau elected by the committees, refused to follow the unfortunate example of the Party Council which was left without a party. 
 We cannot at the moment express any opinion on the con-crete questions of the agreement between the Central Commit-tee and the Bureau of Committees of the Majority. 
 All thesequestions, as well as the question of the agenda, the consti-tution of the Congress, etc. 
, will, of course, be decided by the Congress itself. 
 We shall therefore confine ourselvesmerely to wishing the Congress success and appealing to allcomrades to apply themselves immediately and with the ut-most energy to all the necessary preparations for the Congress. 
It is left for us in conclusion to repeat what we said in Vpe-ryod , No. 
 11, namely, that “...we have come very close to a possibly direct and unequivocal way out of the crisis.

 EUROPEAN CAPITAL AND THE AUTOCRACY The Social-Democratic press has repeatedly pointed out that European capital is the saviour of Russian autocracy. 
 Without foreign loans Russian autocracy would not be able to survive. 
 It was advantageous to the French bourgeoisie tosupport its military ally, so long, especially, as paymentson the loans were punctually forthcoming. 
 And the Frenchbourgeoisie lent the autocratic government the round littlesum of ten milliard francs (about 4,000 million rubles). 
 However ... there is nothing eternal under the moon. 
 The war with Japan revealed the utter rottenness of the autoc-racy and ultimately undermined Russia’s credit even withthe French bourgeoisie, its “friend and ally”. 
 In the firstplace, the war showed up Russia’s military weakness;secondly, a continuous chain of reverses, one more crushing than the other, has shown the hopelessness of the war and the inevitability of the complete downfall of the whole abso-lutist system of government; thirdly, the formidable growthof the revolutionary movement in Russia has inspired theEuropean bourgeoisie with a mortal dread of an explosionthat might set all Europe ablaze. 
 Mountains of inflammable material have piled up within the last few decades. 
 And now all these factors, taken together, have led ultimately to therefusal of further loans. 
 The recent attempt of the autocraticgovernment to borrow from France, as it had done in thepast, ended in failure. 
 On the one hand, capital no longerhas confidence in the autocracy; on the other, fearing a rev-olution, capital wants to put pressure on the autocracy to have it conclude peace with Japan and to come to terms withthe Russian liberal bourgeoisie. 
 European capital is speculating on peace. 
 The bourgeoi-sie in Europe as well as in Russia has begun to see the connection between war and revolution, to fear a really popular and victorious movement against tsarism. 
 The bourgeoisiewants to preserve the “social order” of a society based onexploitation against excessive shocks; it wants to preservethe Russian monarchy as a constitutional, or pseudo-consti-tutional, monarchy, and is therefore speculating on peace in pursuance of anti-proletarian and anti-revolutionary interests. 
 This indubitable fact clearly shows us that even so“simple” and plain an issue as that of war and peace cannotproperly be posed if the class antagonisms of modern societyare lost sight of, if the fact is overlooked that the bourgeoi-sie in everything it does, howsoever democratic or humani-tarian it may appear, defends first and foremost the interests of its own class, the interests of “social peace”, viz. 
, thesuppression and disarming of all oppressed classes. 
 Theproletarians’ way of presenting the question of peace, there-fore, differs and must inevitably differ from that of the bour-geois democrats, as it does on the questions of free trade, anti-clericalism, etc. 
 The proletariat struggles against war and will always struggle against it unremittingly, without, how-ever, forgetting for a moment that war can be abolishedonly with the complete abolition of society’s division intoclasses; that while class rule continues to exist war cannotbe regarded only from the sentimentally democratic stand-point; that in a war between exploiting nations one must distinguish between the roles of the progressive and of thereactionary bourgeoisie of each nation. 
 Russian Social-De-mocracy has had to apply these general principles of Marxismconcretely to the war with Japan. 
 In dealing with the sig-nificance of this war (see Vperyod , No. 
 2, the article “The Fall of Port Arthur” *), we pointed out that not only our Socialists-Revolutionaries (who blamed Guesde and Hyndmanfor sympathising with Japan), but also the new-Iskrists,had adopted a false, bourgeois-democratic standpoint. 
With the latter this found expression, first, in consid-erations of “peace at any price ”, and, secondly, in the conten-tion that it is impermissible “to speculate on a victory of the *See p. 
 52 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 Japanese bourgeoisie”. 
 Both these considerations were worthy only of a bourgeois democrat, who deals with political ques-tions on sentimental grounds. 
 Reality has now shown that “peace at any price ” has become the slogan of the European financiers and Russian reactionaries (Prince Meshchersky inGrazhdanin 85 now speaks clearly of the need for peace for the salvation of the autocracy). 
 It is now perfectly clear thatspeculation on peace for the purpose of suppressing the revo-lution is a speculation of reactionaries, in contrast to the speculation of the progressive bourgeoisie on a victory of the Japanese bourgeoisie. 
 The new Iskra ’s phrase-mongering against “speculation” in general is actually mere sentimen-tal balderdash, far from the class standpoint and from anyconsideration of the various social forces. 
 The events that have exposed the new visage of the reac-tionary bourgeoisie were so glaring that now even Iskra has begun to see its error. 
 Whereas in issue No. 
 83 it “snappedback” at our article in Vperyod , No. 
 2, we now read with pleasure in issue No. 
 90 (leader): “We should not demandonly peace; for if the autocracy continues to exist, peace will spell ruin to the country. 
” Exactly: we should not de-mand only peace; for a tsarist peace is no better (and is some-times worse) than a tsarist war. 
 We should not put for-ward the slogan of “peace at any price”, but only of peacewith the fall of the autocracy, of peace concluded by a lib-erated nation, by a free Constituent Assembly, i. 
e. 
, peace not at any price, but solely at the price of overthrowing abso-lutism. 
 Let us hope that Iskra , having realised this, will also realise the inappropriateness of its highly moral tiradesagainst speculation on a victory of the Japanese bourgeoisie. 
 Let us return, however, to European capital and its po-litical “speculations”. 
 How much tsarist Russia quails before this capital may be seen, for instance, from the following highly instructive incident. 
 The Times , organ of the conserv-ative English bourgeoisie, published an article entitled“Is Russia Solvent?” The article described in detail the “sub-tle mechanism” of the financial manipulations of Messrs. 
Witte, Kokovtsev & Co. 
 They are always running their busi-ness at a loss. 
 They muddle through only by getting deeper and deeper into debt. 
 In between loans the proceeds of thepreceding loan are placed in the Treasury, and the “gold reserve” is then triumphantly proclaimed a “free cash bal-ance”. 
 The gold obtained as a loan is shown to everybody as proof of Russia’s wealth and solvency! Small wonder that the English merchant compared this hanky-panky to thetricks of the Humberts, the famous impostors, who used todisplay borrowed or swindled money (or even a safe pur-porting to contain money) in order to obtain new loans. 
 The Times writes: “The frequent appearances of the Russian Gov-ernment as a borrower in the Continental money market are due, not to capital requirements—that is to say, to repro-ductive enterprises or exceptional and transitory expenses—but almost exclusively to the normal deficiency of nationalincome. 
 This means that, as she is situated today, Russiais marching direct to insolvency. 
 Her national balance-sheet leaves her every year deeper in debt. 
 Her liabilities to the foreigner are more than her people can bear, and she haspractically nothing to show for them. 
 Her gold reserve is acolossal Humbert safe, the vaunted millions of which areunconsciously lent by her dupes for their own further decep-tion. 
” How artful! To pick a dupe, borrow money from him, then show him this very money as evidence of your wealth, inorder to wheedle further loans from him! The comparison with those notorious swindlers, the Hum-bert family, was so apt and the “gist” and purpose of the fa-mous “free cash balance” were so neatly nailed that that arti-cle in such a respectable conservative newspaper created a sensation. 
 Kokovtsev, the Minister of Finance, personallysent a telegram to The Times , which it printed forthwith (March 23 [10]). 
 In his telegram the insulted Kokovtsevinvited the editors of The Times to come to St. 
 Petersburg and verify the gold reserve in person. 
 The editors thanked him for the kind invitation, but declined it, on the simple grounds that the article which had hurt the feelings of thetsar’s servant did not in the least deny the existence of agold reserve. 
 The comparison with the Humberts implied,not that Russia did not have the gold reserve to which itreferred, but that this reserve was actually made up of other people’s money, of wholly unsecured borrowings which did not in the least testify to Russia’s wealth, and to whichit would be ridiculous to refer as security for fresh loans! Mr. 
 Kokovtsev missed the point of this witty but mali-cious comparison, and set the whole world laughing by his telegram. 
 Investigating gold reserves in banks was not in the range of duties of journalists, The Times said in its reply to the Minister of Finance. 
 Indeed, it was the dutyof the press to expose the trick played with the aid of thesereally existing “gold reserves” fictitiously displayed asevidence of the country’s wealth. 
 The question is not whether you have this gold reserve or not, the newspaper lectured the Russian Minister of Finance in an article dealing withthis comic telegram. 
 We believe that you have it. 
 The ques-tion is, what are your assets and your liabilities? What isthe amount of your debts and what security have you? Or,more plainly put, is your stored reserve your property, or is it borrowed and liable to be refunded, which you cannot do in full because you do not possess so much? The Englishbourgeois, making fun of the simple Minister, tried to ex-plain to him this none-too-subtle thing in a variety of ways,adding for his edification: If you are looking for someone toinvestigate your assets and liabilities, why not call on the representatives of the Russian people? As it happens, the people’s representatives are keen to get together in a repre-sentative assembly, be it called Zemsky Sobor or by someother name. 
 Surely they will not refuse to investigate prop-erly , not only the famous “gold reserve”, but all the fi-nances of the autocracy. 
 And they will certainly be able to make a thorough job of it. 
 “Possibly”, The Times sarcastically concludes, “the knowl-edge that the representative assembly would claim thisoffice as a right” makes the tsarist government fear the con-vocation of such an assembly, “at least in any shape inwhich it could exercise real power. 
” An insidious assertion. 
 It is all the more insidious, all the more significant, for being made, in reality, not by The Times , but by the entire European bourgeoisie —made, not as a polemical manoeuvre, but as an open expression ofits distrust of the autocracy, of its unwillingness to lend itmoney, of its desire to deal with the lawful representatives of the Russian bourgeoisie. 
 It is not an assertion, but a warn-ing. 
 It is not a sneer, but an ultimatum , the ultimatum of European capital to the Russian autocracy. 
 While Japan’s allies, the English, word this ultimatum in the form of sarcasm, Russia’s allies, the French, in their most con-servative, most bourgeois paper, Le Temps , say the same thing, only a little more mildly—sugar-coating the pill,but virtually nonetheless refusing to lend any more, and ad-vising the autocracy to make peace with Japan and with theRussian bourgeois liberals. 
 Here is another voice, that ofa no less respectable English magazine, The Economist : “The truth about Russian finance is at length coming to be appreciated in France. 
 We have pointed out again and againthat Russia has long been living on borrowed money, that,despite glowing statements issued by succeeding Ministersof Finance, the budgets have shown a large deficit yearfter year, though these have been cunningly concealed by a book-keeping device, and that the much-vaunted ‘free cash balances’ of the Treasury consist principally of the pro-ceeds of loans and partly of the deposits of the State Bank. 
”After telling the Russian autocracy these home truths, thisfinancial magazine finds it necessary, however, to addsome bourgeois consolations to the effect that if you can man-age to make peace immediately and to make some paltry concessions to the liberals, Europe will doubtlessly beginagain to lend you millions upon millions. 
 We are witnessing what is virtually a speculative gamble of the international bourgeoisie to save Russia from revolu-tion and tsarism from utter ruin. 
 The speculators are put-ting pressure on the tsar by refusing to grant loans. 
 They are making use of their power, the power of the money-bag. 
They want a moderate and tidy bourgeois-constitutional(or pseudo-constitutional) regime in Russia. 
 The rapid marchof events unites them ever more closely into a single counter-revolutionary bourgeois alliance, regardless of differences of nationality—French financiers and English business mag-nates, German capitalists, and Russian merchants. 
 Osvobozh-deniye has acted in the spirit of this mildly moderate bourgeois party. 
 In issue No. 
 67, where he sets forth the “programmeof the Democratic Party” and even recognises (for how long?)universal, direct, and equal suffrage by secret ballot (passing over in modest silence the arming of the people!), Mr. 
 Struve ends his new profession de foi with the following character-istic statement, printed in bold type “for the sake of impor-tance”: “At the present moment the demand for the immediate cessation of the war should stand outside and above the pro-gramme of every progressive party in Russia. 
 In practice this means that the government now existing in Russia should, through the medium of France, begin peace negotiationswith the Japanese Government. 
” The distinction betweenthe bourgeois-democratic and the Social-Democratic demandsto end the war could hardly be stated more trenchantly. 
 The revolutionary proletariat does not put this demand “above the programme”; it addresses it, not to “the governmentnow existing”, but to the free, truly sovereign popular Con-stituent Assembly. 
 The revolutionary proletariat does not“speculate” on the mediation of the French bourgeoisie, whichis seeking peace for avowedly anti-revolutionary and anti-proletarian purposes. 
 Finally, it is essentially with this same international party of the moderate bourgeoisie that Mr. 
 Bulygin is nowbargaining—skilfully playing for time, wearing his opponentdown, feeding him with promises, but giving absolutelynothing definite, and leaving everything, absolutely every-thing, in Russia as it was before, beginning with the use of troops against strikers, continuing with the arrest of politicalsuspects and repressive measures against the press, andending with a dastardly incitement of the peasants against theintellectuals and the brutal flogging of rebel peasants. 
 Andthe liberals rise to the bait; some are already beginning to believe Bulygin, while in the Lawyers’ Association Mr. 
 Kuzmin-Karavayev tries to persuade the liberals to sacrificeuniversal suffrage for the sake of ... Mr. 
 Bulygin’s blue eyes! 86 There is only one force that can stand up to the inter-national alliance of the moderate conservative bourgeoisie,and that is the international alliance of the revolutionary proletariat. 
 With respect to political solidarity, this alliance is already fully formed. 
 As for the practical side and therevolutionary initiative, everything depends on Russia’sworking class and the success of its joint democratic actionfor the decisive struggle in conjunction with the millions ofthe urban and rural poor.

 13 and 14 I Only five years ago many representatives of Social-Democra-cy thought the slogan “Down with the Autocracy!” prematureand unintelligible to the mass of the workers. 
 These repre-sentatives were rightly classed as opportunists. 
 It was explained to them again and again and finally made clear thatthey were lagging behind the movement, that they did notunderstand the tasks of the Party as vanguard of the class, asits leader and organiser, as the representative of the movementas a whole and of its fundamental and principal aims. 
 These aims might be overshadowed for a time by the day-to-day routine, but they should never lose their significance as theguiding star of the fighting proletariat. 
 Now the time has come when the flames of revolution have spread throughout the land, and when even the most scepti-cal have come to believe in the inevitable overthrow of the autocracy in the near future. 
 But Social-Democracy, as if by some irony of history, has to deal once more with preciselythe same reactionary and opportunist attempts to dragthe movement back, to play down its tasks, and to obscureits slogans. 
 Polemics with the proponents of such attemptsbecome the task of the day, and (contrary to the opinion of the very many who dislike intra-Party polemics) acquire tremendous practical importance. 
 For the nearer we get to realising our immediate political tasks, the greater is the needto have an absolutely clear understanding of those tasksand the more harmful is all ambiguity, all reticence andmental inconclusiveness on this question. 
 And yet mental inconclusiveness is by no means a rare thing among the Social-Democrats of the new Iskra or (what is practically the same) the Rabocheye Dyelo camp. 
 Down with the Autocracy!—everyone agrees with this, not only all Social-Democrats, but all democrats, even all liberals, if one is to believe their current declarations. 
 But what does it mean? How is this overthrow of the present government totake place? Who is to convene the Constituent Assembly,which even the Osvobozhdeniye people (see issue No. 
 67 of Osvobozhdeniye ) are now prepared to advance as their slogan, including the demand for universal, direct, and equal suf-frage? Precisely what should constitute the real guarantee that the elections to such an assembly will be free and willexpress the interests of the whole people? He who fails to give a clear and definite answer to these questions does not grasp the meaning of the slogan “Downwith the Autocracy”. 
 And these questions inevitably bring us to the question of the provisional revolutionary govern-ment; it is not difficult to understand that really free, popularelections to a Constituent Assembly, fully guaranteeingtruly universal, equal, and direct suffrage by secret ballot,are not only improbable, but actually impossible underthe autocracy. 
 And if we are in earnest in putting forward a practical demand for the immediate overthrow of the autocratic government, we must be clear in our minds as toprecisely what other government we want to replace the one that is to be overthrown. 
 In other words, what do we thinkshould be the attitude of the Social-Democrats towards aprovisional revolutionary government? On this question the opportunists of present-day Social-Democracy, viz. 
, the new-Iskrists, are dragging the Partyback just as strenuously as the Rabocheye Dyelo -ists did five years ago on the question of political struggle in general. 
Their reactionary views on this point are fully elabo-rated in Martynov’s pamphlet Two Dictatorships , which Iskra , No. 
 84, approved and recommended in a special review, and to which we have repeatedly called our readers’attention. 
 At the outset of his pamphlet Martynov tries to frighten us with the following grim prospect: If a strong, revolution-ary Social-Democratic organisation could “time and carry out the general armed uprising of the people” against the autocracy, as Lenin dreamed, “is it not obvious that thegeneral will of the people would on the morrow after the revolution designate precisely this party as the provisional government? Is it not obvious that the people would entrust the immediate fate of the revolution precisely to this party, and to no other?” This is incredible, but true. 
 The future historian of Rus-sian Social-Democracy will have to record with surprisethat at the very outset of the Russian revolution the Giron-dists of Social-Democracy tried to frighten the revolutionary proletariat with such a prospect! Martynov’s pamphlet (aswell as a host of articles and passages in the new Iskra ) is nothing but an attempt to daub the “horrors” of such a pros-pect. 
 The ideological leader of the new-Iskrists is hauntedby fear of “a seizure of power”, by the bogy of “Jacobinism”,of Bakuninism, of Tkachovism, 87 and of all the other dread-ful isms with which old wives on the fringe of the revolutionare so eager to scare political infants. 
 Naturally, this is donenot without “quoting” Marx and Engels. 
 Poor Marx and poorEngels, what abuses their works have suffered throughquotations! You remember how the maxim “Every classstruggle is a political struggle” 88 was invoked to justify the narrowness and backwardness of our political tasks and methods of political agitation and struggle? Now it is Engelswho is made to give false evidence in favour of tail-ism. 
 In The Peasant War in Germany , he wrote: “The worst thing that can befall a leader of an extreme party is to be compelledto take over a government in an epoch when the movement is not yet ripe for the domination of the class which he rep-resents, and for the realisation of the measures which thatdomination requires. 
” One has only to read carefully thisopening of the lengthy passage which Martynov quotes to Engels speaks of a government that is required for the domina-tion of a class . 
 Is this not obvious? Applied to the proletar-iat, it consequently means a government that is required for the domination of the proletariat , i. 
e. 
, the dictatorship of the proletariat for the effectuation of the socialist revolu-tion. 
 Martynov fails to understand this, and confounds theprovisional revolutionary government in the period of the overthrow of the autocracy with the requisite domination of the proletariat in the period of the overthrow of the bourgeoi-sie; he confounds the democratic dictatorship of thesee plainl y how our tail-ender distorts the author’s meaning. 
 proletariat and the peasantry with the socialist dictatorship of the working class. 
 Yet if we continue reading the quoted passage, Engels’ idea becomes still clearer. 
 The leader of the extreme party, he says, will have to “advance the interestsof an alien class, and to feed his own class with phrases and promises, and with the assurances that the interests of thatalien class are its own interests . 
 Whoever finds himself in this false position is irrevocably lost. 
” 89 The underlined passages clearly show that Engels expressly warns against the false position that results from a leader’sfailure to understand the real interests of “his own”class and the real class content of the revolution. 
 To makethis clearer to the subtle mind of our Martynov we shallessay a simple illustration. 
 When the adherents of the Narod-naya Volya, in the belief that they represented the interests of “Labour”, assured themselves and others that 90 per centof the peasants in the future Russian Constituent Assemblywould be socialists, they put themselves in a false positionwhich was bound to spell their irrevocable political doom,since these “promises and assurances” were at variance with objective reality. 
 Actually they would have advanced the interests of the bourgeois democrats, “the interests of an alienclass”. 
 Are you not beginning to perceive a ray of light, mostworthy Martynov? When the Socialists-Revolutionariesdescribe the agrarian reforms that must inevitably come aboutin Russia as “socialisation”, as “the transfer of the land to the people”, as the beginning of “equality in land tenure”, they place themselves in a false position which is bound tolead to their irrevocable political doom, because, in practice,the very reforms for which they strive will bring aboutthe domination of an alien class , of the peasant bourgeoisie, so that the more rapidly the revolution develops, the more rapidly will their phrases, promises, and assurances be refuted by reality. 
 Do you still fail to see the point, mostworthy Martynov? Do you still fail to comprehend that theessence of Engels’ thought is that it is fatal not to under-stand the real historical tasks of the revolution and that Engels’ words are applicable, therefore, to the Narodnaya Volya adherents and the “Socialists-Revolutionaries”? II Engels points to the danger of failure on the part of the leaders of the proletariat to understand the non-proletarian character of the revolution, but our sage Martynov infersfrom this the danger that the leaders of the proletariat, who,by their programme, their tactics (i. 
e. 
, their entire prop-aganda and agitation), and their organisation, have sepa-rated themselves from the revolutionary democrats, will play a leading part in establishing the democratic republic. 
Engels sees the danger in the leader’s confounding of thepseudo-socialist with the really democratic character of therevolution, while our sage Martynov infers from this thedanger that the proletariat, together with the peasantry, may consciously assume the dictatorship in the establishment of the democratic republic, the last form of bourgeois domina-tion and the best form for the class struggle of the proletar-iat against the bourgeoisie. 
 Engels sees the danger in thefalse, deceptive position of saying one thing and doinganother, of promising the domination of one class and actual-ly ensuring that of another. 
 Engels sees the irrevocable political doom consequent upon such a false position, whileour sage Martynov deduces the danger that the bourgeoisadherents of democracy will not permit the proletariat andthe peasantry to secure a really democratic republic. 
 Oursage Martynov cannot for the life of him understand that such a doom, the doom of the leader of the proletariat, the doom of thousands of proletarians in the struggle for a trulydemocratic republic, would well be a physical doom, but not,however, a political doom; on the contrary, it would be amomentous political victory of the proletariat, a momentousachievement of its hegemony in the struggle for liberty. 
 Engels speaks of the political doom of one who unconsciously strays from the path of his own class to that of an alienclass, while our sage Martynov, reverently (quoting Engels,speaks of the doom of one who goes further and further alongthe sure road of his own class. 
 The difference between the point of view of revolution-ary Social-Democracy and that of tail-ism is glaringly obvious. 
 Martynov and the new Iskra shrink from the task which the proletariat, together with the peasantry, is called upon to shoulder—the task of the most radical democratic revolu-tion; they shrink from the Social-Democratic leadership and of this revolution and thus surrender, albeit unwittingly, the interests of the proletariat into the hands of thebourgeois democrats. 
 From Marx’s correct idea that we mustprepare, not a government party, but an opposition partyof the future , Martynov draws the conclusion that we must form a tail-ist opposition to the present revolution. 
 This is what his political wisdom adds up to. 
 His line of reason-ing, which we strongly advise the reader to ponder, is asfollows: “The proletariat cannot win political power in the state, either wholly or in part, until it has made the socialistrevolution. 
 This is the indisputable proposition which sepa-rates us from opportunist Jaurèsism...” (Martynov, op. 
 cit. 
 , p. 
 58)—and which, we would add, conclusively proves thatthe worthy Martynov is incapable of grasping what the wholething is about. 
 To confound the participation of the prole-tariat in a government that is resisting the socialist revolu-tion with its participation in the democratic revolution is to miss the point hopelessly. 
 It is like confounding Millerand’s participation in the Cabinet of the murdererGalliffet with Varlin’s 90 participation in the Commune, which defended and safeguarded the republic. 
 But listen further, and see what a tangle our author gets himself into: “But that being the case, it is evident that the coming revolution cannot realise any political forms against the will of the whole bourgeoisie, for the latter will be the master tomorrow...” (Martynov’s italics). 
 In the first place, whyare only political forms mentioned here, when the previoussentence referred to the power of the proletariat in general,even to the extent of the socialist revolution? Why does not the author speak of realising economic forms? Because, without noticing it, he has already leaped from the socialist tothe democratic revolution. 
 Secondly, that being the case, theauthor is absolutely wrong in speaking tout court (bluntly) of “the will of the whole bourgeoisie”, because the very thingthat distinguishes the epoch of democratic revolution is the diversity of wills of the various strata of the bourgeoisie which is just emancipating itself from absolutism. 
 To speakof the democratic revolution and confine oneself to a bald contrast of “proletariat” and “bourgeoisie” is sheer nonsense, for that revolution marks the period in the development of society in which the mass of society virtually stands between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie and constitutes animmense petty-bourgeois, peasant stratum. 
 For the veryreason that the democratic revolution has not yet beenconsummated, this immense stratum has far more interests incommon with the proletariat in the matter of realising political forms than has the “bourgeoisie” in the real and strict sense of the word. 
 Failure to understand thissimple thing is one of the main sources of Martynov’smuddle. 
 Further: “That being the case, the revolutionary struggle of the proletariat, by simply frightening the majority of the bourgeois elements, can have but one result—the restoration of absolutism in its original form ... and, of course, the pro-letariat will not halt before this possible result; at the worst,if things tend decidedly towards a revival and strengtheningof the decaying autocratic regime by means of a pseudo-constitutional concession, it will not hold back from frightening the bourgeoisie. 
 In entering the struggle, however, the proletariat obviously does not have this ‘worst’ inview. 
” Can you make anything of this, dear reader? The proletar-iat will not hold back from frightening the bourgeoisie,which course will lead to the restoration of absolutism, if there should be a threat of a pseudo-constitutional conces-sion! This is as much as to say: I am threatened with anEgyptian plague in the form of a one-day conversationwith Martynov alone; therefore, if the worst comes to theworst, I shall fall back on the method of intimidation, whichcan lead only to a two-day conversation with Martynov and Martov. 
 This is the sheerest gibberish, sir! The idea that haunted Martynov when he wrote the non-sense here quoted was the following: if in the period of thedemocratic revolution the proletariat uses the threat of thesocialist revolution to frighten the bourgeoisie, this can leadonly to reaction, which will also weaken the democratic gains already won. 
 That and nothing more. 
 There can be no ques-tion, of course, either of restoring absolutism in its originalform or of the proletariat’s readiness, if the worst comes to /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR the worst, to resort to the worst kind of stupidity. 
 The whole thing takes us back to the difference between the democratic and the socialist revolution, overlooked by Martynov, to the existence of that immense peasant and petty-bourgeoispopulation which is capable of supporting the democraticrevolution, but is at present incapable of supporting thesocialist revolution. 
 Let us listen further to our sage Martynov: “Evidently, the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie on the eve of the bourgeois revolution must differ in somerespects from the same struggle at its concluding stage, on theeve of the socialist revolution.... 
” Yes, this is evident; andif Martynov had paused to think what this difference actual-ly is, he would hardly have written the above-given drivel, or, indeed, his whole pamphlet. 
 “The struggle to influence the course and outcome of the bourgeois revolution can find expression only in the exer-tion of revolutionary pressure by the proletariat on the willof the liberal and radical bourgeoisie, and in the compulsionon the part of the more democratic ‘lower strata’ of society to bring the ‘upper strata’ into agreement to carry through the bourgeois revolution to its logical conclusion. 
 The strug-gle will find expression in the fact that the proletariat willat every opportunity confront the bourgeoisie with thedilemma—either backward, into the strangling grip ofabsolutism, or forward, with the people. 
” This tirade is the central point of Martynov’s pamphlet. 
 We have here its sum and substance, all its fundamental“ideas”. 
 And what do all these clever ideas turn out to be?Who are these “lower strata” of society, the “people” of whomour sage has at last bethought himself? They are preciselythat multitudinous petty-bourgeois stratum of town and vil-lage which is quite capable of functioning in a revolutionary-democratic capacity. 
 And what is this pressure that the proletariat and the peasantry can exert on the upper socialstrata, what is meant by the proletariat advancing togetherwith the people in despite of the upper social strata? It isthat same revolutionary democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry against which our tail-ender is declaiming! Only he is afraid to think to the end, to calla spade a spade. 
 And so he utters words whose meaning he does not understand. 
 In ludicrous, florid language, * he tim-idly repeats slogans, the true significance of which escapes him. 
 None but a tail-ender could deliver himself of such a curio in the most “interesting” part of his summary as: revo-lutionary pressure of the proletariat and the “people” on theupper strata of society, but without a revolutionary-demo-cratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry. 
 Onlya Martynov could show himself so adept! Martynov wants the proletariat to threaten the upper strata of society that it will go forward with the people, while at the same timefirmly deciding with its new-Iskra leaders not to go for-ward along the democratic path, because that is the path of the revolutionary-democratic dictatorship. 
 Martynovwants the proletariat to exert pressure on the will of the upper strata by displaying its own lack of will. 
 Martynov wants the proletariat to bring the upper strata “into agree-ment” to carry the bourgeois revolution through to itslogical, democratic-republican conclusion, but to do so byexpressing its own fear of assuming , jointly with the people, the task of carrying the revolution through, its fear of taking power and forming the democratic dictatorship. 
 Martynov wants the proletariat to be the vanguard in the democraticrevolution and therefore our sage Martynov frightens the proletariat with the perspective of participation in theprovisional revolutionary government in the event of thesuccess of the insurrection! Reactionary tail-ism could go no further. 
 We should all prostrate ourselves before Martynov, as we would beforea saint, for having developed the tail-ist tendencies of thenew Iskra to their logical conclusion and for having given them emphatic and systematic expression with regard to themost pressing and basic political questions. 
 ** *We have already pointed out the absurdity of the idea that, if the worst comes to the worst, the proletariat might push the bourgeoi-sie back. 
 **This article was already set up when we received issue No. 
 93 of Iskra , with which we shall deal on another occasion. 
91 III What is Martynov’s muddle-headedness due to? To the fact that he confounds democratic revolution with socialistrevolution; that he overlooks the role of the intermediatestratum of the people lying between the “bourgeoisie” andthe “proletariat” (the petty-bourgeois masses of the urbanand rural poor, the “semi-proletarians”, the semi-proprie-tors); and that he fails to understand the true meaning of our minimum programme. 
 Martynov has heard that it iswrong for a socialist to participate in a bourgeois Cabinet(when the proletariat is struggling for the socialist revo-lution), and he hastens to “understand” this as meaning thatwe should not participate with the revolutionary bourgeois democrats in the democratic revolution and in the dicta-torship that is essential for the full accomplishment of sucha revolution. 
 Martynov read our minimum programme, buthe missed the fact that the strict distinction it draws be-tween transformations that can be carried out in a bourgeoissociety and socialist transformations is not merely booklore but is of the most vital, practical significance; he missed the fact that in a revolutionary period this programme mustbe immediately tested and applied in practice. 
 It did notoccur to him that rejecting the idea of the revolutionary-democratic dictatorship in the period of the autocracy’sdownfall is tantamount to renouncing the fulfilment of our minimum programme. 
 Indeed, let us but consider all the economic and political transformations formulated in thatprogramme—the demand for the republic, for arming thepeople, for the separation of the Church from the State, forfull democratic liberties, and for decisive economic reforms. 
Is it not clear that these transformations cannot possibly be brought about in a bourgeois society without the revolution-ary-democratic dictatorship of the lower classes? Is it notclear that it is not the proletariat alone, as distinct from the“bourgeoisie”, that is referred to here, but the “lower classes”,which are the active motive force of every democratic revo-lution? These classes are the proletariat plus the scores of millions of urban and rural poor whose conditions of exist-ence are petty-bourgeois. 
 Without a doubt, very many repre-sentatives of these masses belong to the bourgeoisie. 
 But there is still less doubt that the complete establishment of democracy is in the interests of these masses, and that the more enlightened these masses are, the more inevitable will be their struggle for the complete establishment of democracy. 
Of course, a Social-Democrat will never forget the dualpolitical and economic nature of the petty-bourgeois urban andrural masses; he will never forget the need for a separateand independent class organisation of the proletariat, which struggles for socialism. 
 But neither will he forget that these masses have “a future as well as a past, judgement as well asprejudices”, 92 a judgement that urges them onward towards the revolutionary-democratic dictatorship; he will not for-get that enlightenment is not obtained from books alone,and not so much from books even as from the very progress of the revolution, which opens the eyes of the people and gives them a political schooling. 
 Under such circumstances,a theory that rejects the idea of the revolutionary-democraticdictatorship cannot be otherwise designated than as a philo-sophical justification of political backwardness. 
 The revolutionary Social-Democrat will reject such a theory with contempt. 
 He will not confine himself on the eve of the revolution to pointing out what will happen “ifthe worst comes to the worst”. 
 Rather, he will also show thepossibility of a better outcome. 
 He will dream—he is obligedto dream if he is not a hopeless philistine—that, after thevast experience of Europe, after the unparalleled upsurge of energy among the working class in Russia, we shall suc-ceed in lighting a revolutionary beacon that will illuminemore brightly than ever before the path of the unenlightenedand downtrodden masses; that we shall succeed, standing as wedo on the shoulders of a number of revolutionary generationsof Europe, in realising all the democratic transformations, the whole of our minimum programme, with a thorough-ness never equalled before. 
 We shall succeed in ensuringthat the Russian revolution is not a movement of a fewmonths, but a movement of many years; that it leads, notmerely to a few paltry concessions from the powers that be,but to the complete overthrow of those powers. 
 And if we succeed in achieving this, then ... the revolutionary con-flagration will spread to Europe; the European worker,languishing under bourgeois reaction, will rise in his turn and show us “how it is done”; then the revolutionary upsurge in Europe will have a repercussive effect upon Russia and will convert an epoch of a few revolutionary years into an era of several revolutionary decades; then—but we shall haveample time to say what we shall do “then”, not from thecursed remoteness of Geneva, but at meetings of thousands ofworkers in the streets of Moscow and St. 
 Petersburg, at thefree village meetings of the Russian “muzhiks”. 
 IV Such dreams, of course, are strange and alien to the philistines of the new Iskra and to that “master of men’s minds”, our good dogmatist Martynov. 
 They fear the full achievement of our minimum programme through the revo-lutionary dictatorship of the simple, common people. 
 Theyare afraid for their own political consciousness, afraid oflosing the book knowledge they have learned by rote (butnot assimilated), afraid that they may not be able to distin-guish the correct and bold steps of the democratic transfor-mations from the adventurous leaps of non-class, Narodniksocialism or of anarchism. 
 Their philistine souls warn themwith good reason that in a rapid onward march it is moredifficult to distinguish the right path and quickly to solvethe new and complex problems than in the routine of small-scale, everyday work; therefore, they mutter instinctively: Away, away! Let this cup of revolutionary-democratic dicta-torship pass from me! It’s as much as our life is worth! Gentlemen, better “go slow, with timid zigzags”. 
 Small wonder that Parvus, who had so generously supported the new-Iskrists as long as it was a question chiefly of co-opting the most venerable and the most deserving,finally began to feel very uncomfortable in this stagnant com-pany. 
 Small wonder, too, that he began more and more to feel the taedium vitae , life weariness, in this company. 
 In the end he rebelled. 
 He did not stop at defending the slogan “Organise the revolution”, which had frightened the new Iskra to death; he did not limit himself to writing mani-festos, which Iskra published as separate leaflets, carefully avoiding all mention of the name of the Social-Democratic Labour Party in view of the “Jacobin” horrors. 
 * No, having freed himself from the nightmare of the profound organisation-as-process theory advanced by Axelrod (or was it Luxemburg?), Parvus managed at last to go forward,instead of moving backward like a crab. 
 He refused to performthe Sisyphean labour 93 of endlessly correcting Martynov’s and Martov’s follies. 
 He openly advocated (unfortunately,together with the windbag Trotsky in a foreword to the lat-ter’s bombastic pamphlet Before the Ninth of January ) the idea of the revolutionary-democratic dictatorship, the ideathat it was the duty of Social-Democrats to take part in theprovisional revolutionary government after the overthrow ofthe autocracy. 
 Parvus is profoundly right in saying that theSocial-Democrats must not fear to take bold strides forward, to deal joint “blows” at the enemy, shoulder to shoulder with the revolutionary bourgeois democrats, on the definiteunderstanding, however (very appropriately brought to mind),that the organisations are not to be merged, that we marchseparately but strike together, that we do not conceal thediversity of interests, that we watch our ally as we would our enemy, etc. 
 But for all our warm sympathy for these slogans of a revo-lutionary Social-Democrat * * who has turned away from the tail-enders, we could not help feeling jarred by certain falsenotes that Parvus struck. 
 We mention these slight errors,not out of captiousness, but because from him to whom much *I do not know whether our readers have noticed the following characteristic fact: among all the trash issued by the new Iskra in the form of leaflets, there were some good writings bearing Parvus’ signat-ure. 
 The editors of the new Iskra turned their back on these leaflets, which they printed without the name of our Party or of the publishers. 
 **On the issue raised in Trotsky’s pamphlet with Parvus’ fore-word published at the Party’s printing house, Iskra maintains a judi-cious silence. 
 Obviously, it would not be to its advantage to unravel the mess: while Martynov is pulling one way and Parvus the other way,we shall hold our tongue until Plekhanov has pulled Martov out by the ears! And that, with us, is called “ideological leadership of the party”! Incidentally, a curious piece of “formalism”. 
 Our Solomons on theCouncil have decided that the Party’s cachet is permissible only on pamphlets commissioned by Party organisations. 
 It would be interest-ing to learn from these Solomons what organisation commissioned thepamphlets of Nadezhdin, Trotsky and others. 
 Or were those people right who declared the above-mentioned “decision” to be a mean trick in the parochial spirit against Lenin’s publishing house? is given, much is demanded. 
 It would be most dangerous at present for Parvus to compromise his correct position by his own imprudence. 
 Among the least imprudent is the following sentence in his preface to Trotsky’s pamphlet: “If we wishto keep the revolutionary proletariat apart from the otherpolitical currents, we must learn to stand ideologically atthe head of the revolutionary movement [this is correct],to be more revolutionary than anyone else. 
” This is incor-rect. 
 That is to say, it is incorrect, if the statement is taken in the general sense in which it is expressed by Parvus;it is incorrect from the point of view of the reader to whomthis preface is something standing by itself, apart from Mar-tynov and the new-Iskrists, whom Parvus does not mention. 
If we examine this statement dialectically, i. 
e. 
, relatively, concretely, in all its aspects, and not after the manner of those literary jockeys, who, even many years after, snatchseparate sentences from some single work and distort theirmeaning, it will become clear that Parvus directs the asser-tion expressly against tail-ism, to which extent he is right (compare particularly his subsequent words: “If we lag behind revolutionary development”, etc. 
). 
 But the reader cannot have in mind only tail-enders, since there are othersbesides tail-enders among the dangerous friends of the revo-lution in the camp of the revolutionaries—there are the“Socialists-Revolutionaries”; there are people like theNadezhdins, who are swept along by the tide of events and are helpless in the face of revolutionary phrases; or those who are guided by instinct rather than by a revolutionary outlook(like Gapon). 
 These Parvus forgot; he forgot them becausehis presentation, the development of his thoughts, was notfree, but was hampered by the pleasant memory of the veryMartynovism against which he seeks to warn the reader. 
 Par-vus’ exposition is not sufficiently concrete because he does not consider the totality of the various revolutionarycurrents in Russia, which are inevitable in the epoch of demo-cratic revolution and which naturally reflect the stillunstratified classes of society in such an epoch. 
 At such a time,revolutionary-democratic programmes are quite naturally veiled in vague, even reactionary, socialist ideas concealed behind revolutionary phrases (to wit, the Socialists-Revo-lutionaries and Nadezhdin, who, it seems, changed only his label when he went over from the “revolutionary socialists” to the new Iskra ). 
 Under such circumstances we, the Social-Democrats, never can and never will advance the slogan “Be more revolutionary than anyone else”. 
 We shall not even tryto keep up with the revolutionariness of a democrat who isdetached from his class basis, who has a weakness for finephrases and flaunts catchwords and cheap slogans (especial-ly in agrarian matters). 
 On the contrary, we will always be critical of such revolutionariness; we will expose the real meaning of words, the real content of idealised great events;and we will teach the need for a sober evaluation of theclasses and shadings within the classes, even in the hottestsituations of the revolution. 
 Equally incorrect, for the same reason, are Parvus’ state-ments that “the revolutionary provisional government in Russia will be a government of working-class democracy”,that “if the Social-Democrats are at the head of the revolu-tionary movement of the Russian proletariat, thisgovernment will be a Social-Democratic government”, that theSocial-Democratic provisional government “will be an integral government with a Social-Democratic majority”. 
 This is impossible, unless we speak of fortuitous, transient episodes,and not of a revolutionary dictatorship that will be at alldurable and capable of leaving its mark in history. 
 This isimpossible, because only a revolutionary dictatorship sup-ported by the vast majority of the people can be at all dura-ble (not absolutely, of course, but relatively). 
 The Russian proletariat, however, is at present a minority of the popula-tion in Russia. 
 It can become the great, overwhelming major-ity only if it combines with the mass of semi-proletarians,semi-proprietors, i. 
e. 
, with the mass of the petty-bourgeoisurban and rural poor. 
 Such a composition of the social basis of the possible and desirable revolutionary-democratic dictatorship will, of course, affect the composition of therevolutionary government and inevitably lead to the partic-ipation, or even predominance, within it of the most heter-ogeneous representatives of revolutionary democracy. 
 Itwould be extremely harmful to entertain any illusions on this score. 
 If that windbag Trotsky now writes (unfortunate-ly, side by side with Parvus) that “a Father Gapon couldappear only once”, that “there is no room for a second Gapon”, he does so simply because he is a windbag. 
 If there were no room in Russia for a second Gapon, there would be no room for a truly “great”, consummated democratic revolu-tion. 
 To become great, to evoke 1789-93, not 1848-50,and to surpass those years, it must rouse the vast masses toactive life, to heroic efforts, to “fundamental historiccreativeness”; it must raise them out of frightful ignorance,unparalleled oppression, incredible backwardness, and abysmal dullness. 
 The revolution is already raising them and will raise them completely; the government itself is facilitatingthe process by its desperate resistance. 
 But, of course,there can be no question of a mature political consciousness,of a Social-Democratic consciousness of these masses or theirnumerous “native” popular leaders or even “muzhik” leaders. 
 They cannot become Social-Democrats at once without first passing a number of revolutionary tests, not only becauseof their ignorance (revolution, we repeat, enlightens withmarvellous speed), but because their class position is notproletarian, because the objective logic of historical develop-ment confronts them at the present time with the tasks, not of a socialist, but of a democratic revolution. 
 In this revolution, the revolutionary proletariat will participate with the utmost energy, sweeping aside the miser-able tail-ism of some and the revolutionary phrases of others. 
It will bring class definiteness and consciousness into thedizzying whirlwind of events, and march on intrepidly and unswervingly, not fearing, but fervently desiring, the revolutionary-democratic dictatorship, fighting for therepublic and for complete republican liberties, fighting forsubstantial economic reforms, in order to create for itself atruly large arena, an arena worthy of the twentieth century,in which to carry on the struggle for socialism. 
 THE REVOLUTIONARY-DEMOCRATIC DICTATORSHIP OF THE PROLETARIAT AND THE PEASANTRY 94 The question of the participation of Social-Democracy in the provisional revolutionary government has been high-lighted less by the course of events than by the theoreti-cal reasonings of Social-Democrats of a certain trend. 
 Wedealt in two articles (issues Nos. 
 13 and 14) with the arguments of Martynov, who was the first to bring up this question. 
 It appears, however, that the interest in the questionis so keen and the misconceptions to which the afore-men-tioned arguments have given rise (see in particular Iskra , No. 
 93) are so great that it is necessary to go into this matteronce more. 
 However Social-Democrats may assess the probability of our having to give more than a theoretical answer to this question in the near future, the Party at anyrate must be clear as to its immediate aims. 
 Unless there isclarity in this matter there can no longer be any consistentpropaganda and agitation free from vacillations andmental reservations. 
 Let us try to reconstruct the essence of the controver-sial question. 
 If what we want is not only concessions from theautocracy but its actual overthrow, we must work to replacethe tsarist government by a provisional revolutionarygovernment, which would, on the one hand, convene a Con-stituent Assembly on the basis of really universal, direct, and equal suffrage by secret ballot, and, on the other, be in a position to ensure real and complete freedom duringthe elections. 
 Thus, the question arises whether it is rightfor the Social-Democratic Labour Party to participate insuch a provisional revolutionary government. 
 This questionwas first raised by spokesmen of the opportunist wing of our Party, specifically by Martynov, prior to the Ninth of January, when he, and with him Iskra , answered it in the negative. 
 Martynov sought to carry the conceptions of the revolutionary Social-Democrats to an absurdity; he fright-ened them by saying that in the event of a successful outcome to our work of organising the revolution, with ourParty’s assumption of leadership of the popular armed uprising,we would have to participate in the provisional revolutionary government. 
 This participation would mean inadmissible “seizure of power”, it would be “crass Jaurèsism”, which noclass-conscious Social-Democratic Party could tolerate. 
 Let us dwell on the contentions of those who hold to such a point of view. 
 By participating in the provisional govern-ment, we are told, Social-Democracy would have the power in its hands; but as the party of the proletariat, Social-Democracy cannot hold the power without attempting to putour maximum programme into effect, i. 
e. 
, without attempt-ing to bring about the socialist revolution. 
 In such anundertaking it would, at the present time, inevitably cometo grief, discredit itself, and play into the hands of the reactionaries. 
 Hence, participation by Social-Democrats in a provisional revolutionary government is inadmissible. 
 This argument is based on a misconception; it confounds the democratic revolution with the socialist revolution, thestruggle for the republic (including our entire minimumprogramme) with the struggle for socialism. 
 If Social-Democ-racy sought to make the socialist revolution its immediate aim, it would assuredly discredit itself. 
 It is precisely suchvague and hazy ideas of our “Socialists-Revolutionaries”that Social-Democracy has always combated. 
 For this rea-son Social-Democracy has constantly stressed the bourgeoisnature of the impending revolution in Russia and insisted on a clear line of demarcation between the democratic minimum programme and the socialist maximum programme. 
 SomeSocial-Democrats, who are inclined to yield to spontaneity,might forget all this in time of revolution, but not the Partyas a whole. 
 The adherents of this erroneous view make an idolof spontaneity in their belief that the march of events will compel the Social-Democratic Party in such a position to set about achieving the socialist revolution, despite itself. 
Were this so, our programme would be incorrect, it would Cover of Lenin’s The Revolutionary-Democratic Dictatorship of the Proletariat and the Peasantry . 
 Published by the Caucasian League of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
, 1905 Facsimile not be in keeping with the “march of events”, which is exactly what the spontaneity worshippers fear; they fear for the correctness of our programme. 
 But this fear (a psychological explanation of which we attempted to give in our articles) isentirely baseless. 
 Our programme is correct. 
 And the marchof events will assuredly confirm this more and more fully astime goes on. 
 It is the march of events that will “impose”upon us the imperative necessity of waging a furious strug-gle for the republic and, in practice, guide our forces, the forces of the politically active proletariat, in this direction. 
It is the march of events that will, in the democratic revolu-tion, inevitably impose upon us such a host of allies fromamong the petty bourgeoisie and the peasantry, whose realneeds will demand the implementation of our minimum pro-gramme, that any concern over too rapid a transition to the maximum programme is simply absurd. 
 On the other hand, however, these very allies from among the petty-bourgeois democrats create in the minds of Social-Democrats of a certain trend new misgivings, namely, fearof “crass Jaurèsism”. 
 Participation in a government with the bourgeois democrats has been banned by a resolution of the Amsterdam Congress 95; it is Jaurèsism, i. 
e. 
, unconscious betrayal of the interests of the proletariat, the reduction ofthe proletariat to a hanger-on of the bourgeoisie, its corrup-tion with the illusion of power, which in reality is completelyunattainable in bourgeois society. 
 That reasoning is no less fallacious. 
 It shows that those who resort to it have memorised good resolutions withoutunderstanding their meaning; they have learned a fewanti-Jaurèsist catchwords by rote, but have not duly weighedthem and thus misapply them; they have learned theletter but not the spirit of the recent lessons of international revolutionary Social-Democracy. 
 To judge Jaurèsism from the point of view of dialectical materialism one mustdraw a clear line between subjective motives and objectivehistorical conditions. 
 Subjectively, Jaurès wanted to savethe republic by entering into an alliance with the bourgeoisdemocrats. 
 The objective conditions of this “experiment” were that the republic in France had become an established fact and was in no grave danger; that the working class hadevery opportunity of developing an independent class political organisation but did not take full advantage of this opportunity, partly because it was influenced by the parlia-mentary humbug of its leaders; that in actual practice, his-tory was already objectively posing before the working classthe tasks of the socialist revolution, from which the Millerands were luring the proletariat with promises of paltry social reforms. 
 Now to take Russia. 
 Subjectively, revolutionary Social-Democrats like the Vperyod -ists or Parvus want to secure the republic by entering into an alliance with the revolutionarybourgeois democrats. 
 The objective conditions differ fromthose in France as night differs from day. 
 Objectively, thehistorical course of events has now posed before the Russianproletariat precisely the task of carrying through the demo-cratic bourgeois revolution (the whole content of which, for brevity’s sake, we sum up in the word Republic); this taskconfronts the people as a whole, viz. 
, the entire mass of thepetty bourgeoisie and the peasantry; without such arevolution the more or less extensive development of anindependent class organisation for the socialist revolution is unthinkable. 
 Try to visualise concretely this complete difference in the objective conditions and then tell us: what is one to thinkof people who, carried away by the similitude of certainwords, by the resemblance between certain letters, and by thesameness of subjective motives, forget this difference? Because in France Jaurès paid homage to bourgeois social reform on the mistaken subjective plea of defending therepublic, we Russian Social-Democrats are to abandon allserious struggle to win the republic! This exactly is what theprofound wisdom of the new-Iskrists amounts to. 
 Indeed, is it not clear that as far as the proletariat is con-cerned the struggle for the republic is inconceivable without an alliance with the petty-bourgeois masses? Is it not clearthat without the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletar-iat and the peasantry there is not a shadow of hope for thesuccess of this struggle? One of the chief flaws in the argumentunder discussion is its deadness, its stereotyped character, its failure to make allowance for the revolutionary situation. 
 Struggling for the republic while at the same time renouncingthe revolutionary-democratic dictatorship is as though Oyama had decided to fight Kuropatkin at Mukden, but disavowed beforehand any intention of taking the city. 
 If we, the revolutionary people, viz. 
, the proletariat and the peasantry, want to “fight together” against the autocracy, wemust fight against it together to the last, finish it off together,and stand together in repelling the inevitable attempts torestore it! (It should be said again, to avoid possible misun-derstanding, that by the republic we understand not only and not so much a form of government as the sum-total of demo-cratic changes envisaged in our minimum programme. 
) Onemust have a schoolboy’s conception of history to imaginethe thing without “leaps”, to see it as something in the shapeof a straight line moving slowly and steadily upwards; firstit will be the turn of the liberal big bourgeoisie—minor concessions from the autocracy; then of the revolutionary petty bourgeoisie—the democratic republic; and finally ofthe proletariat—the socialist revolution. 
 That picture, byand large, is correct, correct à la longue , as the French say— spread over a century or so (in France, for instance, from1789 to 1905); but one must be a virtuoso of philistinism to take this as a pattern for one’s plan of action in a revolu-tionary epoch. 
 If the Russian autocracy, even at thisstage, fails to find a way out by buying itself off with ameagre constitution, if it is not only shaken but actuallyoverthrown , then, obviously, a tremendous exertion of revolu-tionary energy on the part of all progressive classes will be called for to defend this gain. 
 This “defence”, however, is nothing else than the revolutionary dictatorship of the prole-tariat and the peasantry! The more we gain now and the morevigorously we defend the gains, the less will the inevitablefuture reaction be able to reappropriate afterwards, the shorterwill the intervals of reaction be, and the easier will the task be for the proletarian fighters who will come after us. 
 But here come those who, yardstick in hand, à la Ilo-vaisky, * would measure off in advance, before the struggle has begun, a modest little bit of our future conquests—people who, before the downfall of the autocracy, even beforethe events of the Ninth of January, took it into their heads to intimidate the working class of Russia with the bogy of *D. 
 I. 
 Ilovaisky (1832-1920)—a Russian historian, apologist of monarchism. 
— Ed. 
 a terrible revolutionary-democratic dictatorship! And these knights of the yardstick lay claim to the name of revolution-ary Social-Democrats.... 
 Participation in the provisional government with the bourgeois revolutionary democrats, they weep, meanssanctioning the bourgeois order; it means sanctioning theperpetuation of prisons and the police, of unemployment andpoverty, of private property and prostitution. 
 This is an argument worthy either of anarchists or of Narodniks. 
 Social-Democrats do not hold back from struggle for politicalfreedom on the grounds that it is bourgeois political freedom. 
Social-Democrats regard this “sanctioning” of the bourgeoisorder from the historical point of view. 
 When Feuerbach wasasked whether he sanctioned the materialism of Büchner, Vogt, and Moleschott, he said: Backwards I fully agree with the materialists; but not forwards. 
 That is precisely howSocial-Democrats sanction the bourgeois system. 
 They havenever been afraid of saying, and never will be, that theysanction the republican-democratic bourgeois order in prefer-ence to an autocratic serf-owning bourgeois order. 
 But they “sanction” the bourgeois republic only because it is the last form of class rule, because it offers a most convenient arenafor the struggle of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie;they sanction it, not for its prisons and police, its privateproperty and prostitution, but for the scope and freedom itallows to combat these charming institutions. 
 Far be it from us to contend that our participation in the revolutionary provisional government entails no dangersfor Social-Democracy. 
 There is not, nor can there be, anyform of struggle, any political situation that does not in-volve dangers. 
 If there is no revolutionary class instinct,if there is no integral world outlook on a scientific level, if (with due apologies to our friends of the new Iskra ) there are no brains in the head, then it is dangerous even to take partin strikes—it may lead to Economism; to engage in parlia-mentary struggle—it may end in parliamentary cretinism 96; to support the Zemstvo liberal democrats—it may lead toa “plan for a Zemstvo campaign”. 
 It would then be danger-ous even to read the extremely useful writings of Jaurès and Aulard on the French Revolution—it may lead to Martynov’spamphlet on two dictatorships. 
 It goes without saying that if the Social-Democrats were to forget, even for a moment, the class distinctiveness of the proletariat vis-à-vis the petty bourgeoisie, if they were to form an ill-timed and unprofitable alliance with one or anotheruntrustworthy petty-bourgeois party of the intelligentsia,if the Social-Democrats were to lose sight, even for amoment, of their own independent aims and the need (in allpolitical situations and exigencies, in all political crises and upheavals) for attaching paramount importance to devel-oping the class-consciousness of the proletariat and itsindependent political organisation, then participation in theprovisional revolutionary government would be extremelydangerous. 
 But under such circumstances, any politicalstep, we repeat, would be equally dangerous. 
 The groundless-ness of these possible apprehensions as applied to the present formulation of the immediate tasks of the revolutionary So-cial-Democrats is borne out by a few simple statements offact. 
 We shall not speak about ourselves or quote the numer-ous declarations, warnings, and counsels on this questiongiven in Vperyod ; we shall, instead, cite Parvus. 
 He subscribes to the opinion that the Social-Democrats should participate in the provisional revolutionary government, andhe is emphatic on the conditions, which we must never forget,namely, to strike together, but to march separately, notto merge organisations, to watch our ally as we would ourenemy, etc. 
 We shall not dwell in detail on this aspect of the question, having dealt with it in our previous article. 
 No, the real political danger to Social-Democracy today does not lie where the new-Iskrists are looking for it. 
 Itis not the thought of the revolutionary-democratic dicta-torship of the proletariat and the peasantry that should fright-en us, but rather the spirit of tail-ism and torpidity which has such a demoralising effect on the party of the proletariat and finds expression in all kinds of organisation-as-process,arming-as-process theories, and what not. 
 To take, for in-stance, Iskra ’s latest attempt to set up a distinction between the provisional revolutionary government and the revolu-tionary-democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry. 
 Is this not an example of lifeless scholasticism? People who invent such distinctions are capable of stringingtogether fine words but are absolutely incapable of thinking. 
 Actually, these concepts stand to each other roughly in the relation of legal form to class content. 
 To speak of the “pro-visional revolutionary government” is to stress the consti-tutional aspect of the case, the fact that the governmentoriginates, not from the law, but from the revolution, thatit is a temporary government committed to the futureConstituent Assembly. 
 But whatever the form, whatever theorigin, whatever the conditions, one thing at any rate is clear— that the provisional revolutionary government must have the support of definite classes. 
 One has only to rememberthis simple truth to realise that the provisional revolutionarygovernment can be nothing else but the revolutionary dicta-torship of the proletariat and the peasantry. 
 Therefore,Iskra ’s distinction only drags the Party back to fruitless disputes, away from the task of making a concrete analysis of the class interests in the Russian revolution. 
 Or, to take another Iskra argument. 
 The slogan “Long Live the Revolutionary Provisional Government!” drawsfrom that paper the didactic remark: “The combination ofthe words ‘long live’ and ‘government’ sullies the lips. 
” What is this, if not sheer bombast? They talk about over-throwing the autocracy and yet fear to sully themselves byacclaiming the revolutionary government! Surprisingly,they are not afraid of sullying themselves by acclaiminga republic, for a republic necessarily implies a government,and—no Social-Democrat ever doubted it—a bourgeois government at that. 
 In what way, then, does acclaiming the provisional revolutionary government differ from acclaimingthe democratic republic? Must Social-Democracy, the politicalleader of the most revolutionary class, take after an anaemicand hysterical old maid who finically insists on a figleaf?Is it right to acclaim what the bourgeois-democratic government stands for, but wrong directly to acclaim the provisional revolutionary-democratic government? Picture it: the uprising of the workers in St. 
 Petersburg has been victorious; the autocracy is overthrown; the provi-sional revolutionary government has been proclaimed;the armed workers jubilate, with outcries of “Long Live the Provisional Revolutionary Government!” The new-Iskrists stand on the side lines, their innocent eyes raised heaven-ward, solemnly uttering as they beat their chaste breasts: “We thank Thee, O Lord, that we are not like these wretches and have not sullied our lips with such word combinations.... 
” No, comrades, a thousand times no! Have no fear of sullying yourselves by most energetic halting-at-nothingparticipation in a republican revolution together with therevolutionary bourgeois democrats. 
 Do not exaggerate thedangers of such participation; our organised proletariat is quite capable of coping with them. 
 More will be accom-plished in months of the revolutionary dictatorship of theproletariat and the peasantry than in decades of the peaceful,stupefying atmosphere of political stagnation. 
 If, after theNinth of January, the Russian working class, under condi-tions of political slavery, was able to mobilise over a million proletarians for staunch, disciplined, collective action, then, given the revolutionary-democratic dictatorship, we willmobilise scores of millions of the urban and rural poor, andwe will make the Russian political revolution the preludeto the socialist revolution in Europe. 
 Vperyod , No. 
 14, Published according to April 12 (March 30), 1905 the text in Vperyod GRAFT: A FRANCO-RUSSIAN CUSTOM Under this headline the German Social-Democratic news-paper Vorwärts recently published an extremely valuable document—the original text of a letter written by M. 
 Jules Gouin, the manager of a large machine works in Batignol-les (a suburb of Paris), to a ministry official in St. 
 Peters-burg. 
 Through the medium of this gentleman the Frenchworks received an order for 114 locomotives. 
 The totalvalue of the order (at 27,700 francs per locomotive) is some3,000,000 francs, or about 1,200,000 rubles. 
 For his good offices in this transaction the honourable ministerial official (who, we may add, probably occupies a fairly highpost) receives for a start, as we see from the letter, two percent of the purchase price. 
 This amounts to about 25,000rubles. 
 It further appears from the letter (which we do notquote in full for lack of space) that of this sum 13,000 francs have already been received by the go-between; the rest is payable in instalments. 
 Moreover, alterations in the standardtype of locomotives to the specifications of the Russianrailways are to be paid for separately. 
 The St. 
 Petersburgrepresentative of the Paris firm undertakes to inform thisofficial in advance what this extra charge demanded by the works will amount to. 
 If the official can “get” from the Rus-sian Government a higher price than that fixed by the works,the difference too will be placed to his credit as the “go-between”. 
 In the German translation of the letter (writtenin French) this is called Vermittlungsgebühr , “broker’s com-mission”. 
 Actually, of course, this expression is merely a veil to cover a most brazen swindle, an embezzlement of public funds, committed by a French capitalist and a Russianministry official working under a collusive contract. 
 /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR Vorwärts rightly says that the letter casts a lurid light on Russian venality and the advantage that foreign capital takes of it. 
 The letter is documentary proof of the usual “business” practices prevailing in civilised, capitalist coun-tries. 
 These things are done everywhere in Europe, too, butnowhere in such a shameless manner as in Russia; and nowhereis there such “political safety” (safety from exposure) forcorruption as in autocratic Russia. 
 No wonder, conclude the German Social-Democrats, that European industry is inter-ested in preserving the Russian autocracy with its irrespon-sible officials and their shady practices. 
 No wonder Russianofficials fight tooth and nail against a constitution thatthreatens to establish public control over the administra-tion. 
 One can gather from this exposure what the Russian officialdom is “making” on the war with Japan, what sums have found their way into the pockets of officials employedin the St. 
 Petersburg ministries from, say, the sale ofGerman marine shipping to Russia! The national calamity isa gold mine for the war contractors and venal officials. 
 Vperyod , No. 
 14, Published according to April 12 (March 30), 1905 the text in Vperyod THE GUILTY BLAMING THE INNOCENT * Iskra , No. 
 92, contains an article “The Zigzags of a Firm Course”, purporting to show that, in reality, Vperyod is not at all maintaining the principles and the line of the old Iskra firmly and consistently, but, on the contrary, is zigzagging in the wake of the new Iskra . 
 Strictly speak-ing, this allegation is too ludicrous to merit serious consider-ation. 
 What strikes us here is not the content of thenew-Iskra polemic, for it has no content, but its methods. 
 These methods are worth considering; upon examination they reveal that there are polemics and polemics. 
 The old Iskra was disliked for its polemics, but no one ever thought ofcalling them unprincipled. 
 The new Iskra is despised for its polemics, because their unprincipled nature is evidentto the mass of the Party members engaged in practical workand the consistent Rabocheye Dyelo -ists, as well as to the “conciliators” headed by Plekhanov. 
 It is our intention to show the reader with what methods these polemics operate. 
 Let us follow Iskra step by step. 
 Vperyod is leading the Party towards a split, it says. 
 This is not true. 
 All who havestudied the Party crisis, not from old wives’ tales, but from documents, know that it was the Minority that split the Party immediately after the Second Congress, and that itdid so clandestinely by setting up a secret organisation. 
Iskra is engaging in hypocrisy now and is misrepresenting the facts. 
 An open split may evoke hatred, but a secretsplit can evoke only contempt. 
 Vperyod wants no secret split; that is all there is to it. 
 *Delayed for lack of space. 
 Further, they want to charge us with contradicting our-selves on the question of autonomy and centralism. 
 Lenin, they allege, asserted in Steps * that autonomy is a principle of opportunism, whereas now the Bureau of Committees of the Majority itself is in favour of the broadest possibleautonomy for the local committees. 
 Lenin maintained thatbureaucracy stands in the same relation to democracy as theorganisational principle of revolutionary Social-Democracy to the organisational principle of the opportunists, whereas now the Bureau of Committees of the Majority itself com-plains of bureaucracy. 
 This is the substance of their accusa-tion against us. 
 This charge too is built on downright false-hood. 
 In Steps (and, before Steps , in his “Letter to Iskra ” ** Lenin cautioned, declared, reiterated, and emphasised countless times that the phrases used against bureaucracy, for autonomy, etc. 
, were extremely vague, that they wereopen to any number of different constructions and couldbe made to mean almost anything. 
 Lenin declared hundredsof times that, in substance, these phrases were used exclu-sively to veil the desire for co-optation. 
 These words of Lenin have now been fully borne out by the most authentic documentary evidence. 
 If, however, we take these words inthe sense of principle, said Lenin ( if we take!), we shall find the following: Bureaucracy, taken in general, maydenote officialism, red tape, formalism, paper answers. 
This sort of bureaucracy is evil, said Lenin, illustrating his remarks with Martov’s well-known draft of the Rules. 
 It is clear to every reader who is at all conscientious thatthis is the kind of bureaucracy meant by the Bureau of Com-mittees of the Majority, so that to accuse Vperyod of contra-dicting itself is utter childishness. 
 Bureaucracy may meaninfringement of the legitimate and, if we may say so, of the “natural” rights of every opposition, a fight waged against a minority by unfair means. 
 Such bureaucracy ispossible, said Lenin, but there is no principle involved init. 
 It must be combated by the establishment of constitu-tional guarantees of the rights of minorities. 
 Such guarantees *One Step Forward , Two Steps Back , Geneva, May 1904.

 were proposed clearly, frankly, and openly for the first time by the Stone-Hards, or Vperyod -ists, as they are now called, in the well-known Declaration of the Twenty-Two, * which was issued in August, seven months ago, withouthaving since evoked the slightest attempt on the part ofthe new-Iskrists unequivocally to define their attitudetowards it. 
 But apart from these interpretations of bureaucracy, anti-autonomy, etc. 
, it is possible to have interpretationsbased on real principles—not in the form of any irregulari-ties, extremes, etc. 
, but as general principles governingthe entire organisation. 
 This was the interpretation theMensheviks tried to force upon us against our will, despiteour resistance. 
 Lenin, both in his “Letter to Iskra ” and in Steps , sounded innumerable warnings against such an interpretation, which obscures the actual concrete coursethat the crisis and the split have been taking. 
 Lenin made astraightforward appeal in his “Letter to Iskra ”: Drop this nonsense, gentlemen; nine-tenths of it is squabbling! Leninwas attacked for this, and the Central Organ tried to prove that principles were involved. 
 Well, if that is so, Lenin replied and the Vperyod -ists always will reply, then the principle of autonomy is really an opportunist principle for a Social-Democratic organisation. 
 If that is so, thenyour outcries against bureaucracy are, in principle, of apiece with those of the Jaurèsists in France, the Bernstein-ians in Germany, and the reformists in Italy. 
 That is how the matter stands; and to prove it, one has only to study theParty crisis from documents and not from the assurances offriends. 
 Lenin had told the Bundist Lieber at the SecondCongress (see proceedings) that he would defend the autonomyof “any”, even a Tula, Committee, ** against petty cen-tralism; Lenin did not utter a word against the guarantee ofsuch autonomy in Clause 8 of our Party Rules. 
 The prin-ciple of autonomy, however, was never defended either by Lenin or by the Bureau of Committees of the Majority;it was defended by Akimov, by Lieber, by the new-Iskrists. 
It is not difficult, of course, to confuse the issue in the ***See present edition, Vol.

— Ed. 
 mind of the unenlightened reader by tearing words from their context regardless of the circumstances under which they were used and of their original meaning; but newspapers that employ such methods in polemics can only expect to betreated like Novoye Vremya 97. 
 Let us take the pamphlet by “A Worker”. 
 What essential-ly is the point that Iskra confuses? It is that certain unprincipled people have only let themselves in for it with their shouting about the principle of autonomy and the like, since the only reply could be a demand for the electiveprinciple. 
 Thereupon these people began to beat a retreat. 
The Vperyod -ists, on the other hand, have always held that talking big and flaunting the “principles” of autonomy anddemocracy is indecent; but if the Rules require serious, practical amendments along the line of democracy, as far as it is feasible under Russian conditions, let us discuss themopenly and above-board. 
 Vperyod challenged “A Worker” to produce, if he could, any passage in Social-Democraticliterature where the necessity of drawing workers into theParty committees is put as clearly as Lenin put it. 
 * “ A Worker”, led astray by the new-Iskrists, replied in print that he accepted the challenge; it turned out, however, thathe did not understand what accepting the challenge implied,for he did not point out any such passage, but only threat-ened to “give it” to Lenin, to “get even” with him. 
 Naturally,Vperyod left these terrible threats unanswered. 
 Now let us take again the question of a single centre. 
 Lenin, it is alleged, said in Steps that it was the opportun-ists who stood for a single centre, whereas now this is theposition of the Bureau of Committees of the Majority. 
Again the same gross distortion of facts, with an eye to theuninformed or inattentive reader. 
 Whoever wishes to read Steps will find (on page 28, mention of which is so studious-ly avoided by the Iskra columnist) that long before the first article written by a Bolshevik against two centres (Rya-dovoi’s articles in Our Misunderstandings ), Lenin had written that the idea of two centres “took into account thetemporary [mark this!] and special requirements of the Russian Social-Democratic working-class movement in the *See pp. 
 58-59 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 existing conditions of political slavery, with the initial base of operations for the revolutionary assault being set up abroad”. 
 “The first idea,” the author of Steps goes on to say at once in regard to the idea of centralism in general, “as the one [!] matter of principle, had [accordingto the plan of the old Iskra ] to pervade the entire Rules; the second, being a particular idea necessitated by temporarycircumstances of place and mode of action, took the form of a seeming departure from centralism in the proposal to set up two centres” (p. 
 28). 
 * Now, we leave it to the reader to judge the methods of controversy employed by ourParty’s Novoye Vremya ! Iskra simply tries to mislead the reader by keeping back from him the fact (1) that Leninpointed out long ago the temporary, particular significance of the idea of two centres; and (2) that, therefore, Lenin neverexplained the opportunists’ defence of a single centre bygeneral principles, but only by “temporary circumstancesof place and mode of action”, by circumstances under whichthe opportunist wing of the Party actually stood for and had to stand for a single centre. 
 That the old Iskra was a bulwark in the struggle against opportunism is a fact. 
 That it was theopportunist wing which constituted the minority at the Con-gress is also a fact. 
 Why, then, should it be a matter ofsurprise that now, when the new Iskra has turned out to be opportunist and when those in Russia have shown greaterfirmness in principle and Party consistency than those abroad, the “temporary circumstances” have changed? We should not be at all surprised now if the Rabocheye Dyelo -ists, Martynov, the “Marsh”, and the new-Iskrists all tookup a stand (say, at the Third Congress) for two centres,while all the Bolsheviks (or nearly all) stood for one centre. 
It would only be a change, in keeping with the “temporary circumstances”, in the methods of struggle for the same prin-ciples of revolutionary Social-Democracy, the principles ofthe old Iskra for which Lenin and the Bolsheviks fought and continue to fight steadfastly. 
 It is only people of theNovoye Vremya type who can see anything “miraculous” in such a change. 
 (We said that nearly all Bolsheviks were likely to stand for one centre. 
 We have yet to see how things *See present edition, Vol. 
 7, p. 
 240. 
—Ed. 
 will turn out at the Third Congress. 
 There are differences of opinion among us as to the significance of “temporary cir-cumstances of place and mode of action”. 
 We shall compare these different opinions at the Congress and “strike a bal-ance”. 
) The new-Iskra methods of polemising would seem to have been made sufficiently clear in the foregoing, so that wecan now be more brief. 
 Iskra contends that the Bureau of Committees of the Majority violated Party discipline bycalling the Congress, in contravention of the Rules, over thehead of the Council. 
 This is untrue, for the Council hadbroken the Rules long before by its evasion of the Congress. 
We openly declared this in the press quite some time ago asunder by a secret split and dodged the Congress on all kinds of false pretexts, we had no practical way out of the prepos-terous situation other than to convene the Congress againstthe will of the centres. 
 Iskra says that the editorial in issue No. 
 9 of Vperyod , “New Tasks and New Forces”, by insisting on the necessity of considerably increasing the number of Party organisations of every description, contradicts the spirit of Clause 1 of the Rules as formulated by Lenin, who,in defending his idea at the Congress, had urged the neces-sity of narrowing the concept of Party. 
 The objection raisedby Iskra can be recommended as a high-school problem in logic to train young people in debating. 
 The Bolsheviks have always held that the Party should be limited to the sum-total of Party organisations and that the number of theseorganisations should then be increased (see Proceedings of theCongress and Steps , p. 
 40 et al . 
, particularly pp. 
 40-41 and 46). 
 * The new Iskra confounds extension of the Party’s framework with extension of the concept of Party, it con-founds extension of the number of Party organisations with extension of the Party beyond the limits of the Party organ-isations ! To explain this perplexing riddle, we shall give a plain, easy illustration: let us assume for the sake ofsimplicity an army consisting exclusively of men of a singlearm of the service; the manpower of the army must be narrowed down to a total of men who have actually proved * 98(Orlovsky). 
 After the Mensheviks had torn the Party See present edition, Vol.

— Ed. 
 themselves able to shoot, with none allowed to get past with general phrases or verbal assurances of military fitness; after that every effort must be made to increase the number of men who can pass the rifleman’s test. 
 Aren’t youbeginning to see a glimmer of light, gentlemen of the newIskra ? Iskra writes, accusing Vperyod : “Previously only consist-ent Social-Democrats, who had to be recognised as such, were wanted; now all sorts of elements are admitted to the holy of holies, except those that are avowedly non-Social-Democratic. 
” Take Vperyod , No. 
 9. 
 There you will read: “Let all... circles, except those that are avowedly non-Social-Democratic, either directly join the Party or align themselves with the Party [author’s italics]. 
 In the latter event we must not demand that they accept our programme or that they necessarily enter into organisational relationswith us.... 
” * Is it not clear that Iskra is simply juggling, confounding what was “previously needed” for joining theParty with what “is now permitted” for aligned groups? TheBolsheviks have constantly said, and say now in Vperyod , that self-enrolment in the Party is intellectualist anarch-ism, that Party members must accept “obligatory organisa-tional relations” not in words alone. 
 Only people set oncreating confusion can fail to understand this. 
 Vperyod ’s slogan was: Organise new forces for the new tasks into Partyorganisations or, at least, into organisations aligned with the Party. 
 Iskra ’s slogan is: “Open the doors wider!” The ones say: “Take new marksmen into your regiments, organisethose who are learning to shoot into auxiliary units. 
” Theothers say: “Open the doors wider! Let all comers enrolthemselves in the army, any way they please!” As to the question of organising the revolution and or-ganising the arming, Iskra now seeks to assure us that it has no differences with Vperyod . 
 We would ask first of all: what about Parvus? If the differences have merely been invented bythe perfidious Vperyod , why don’t you have it out with the new-Iskrist Parvus, who cannot be suspected of picking onIskra ? You yourselves had to admit your disagreement with Parvus and were the first to do so. 
 Why then this game of *See p. 
 219 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 hide-and-seek? Essentially, the new Iskra argues here against Vperyod in the very manner in which Rabocheye Dyelo used to argue against the old Iskra . 
 We cannot too strongly advise comrades interested in the history of their own Party tore-read Rabocheye Dyelo , particularly issue No. 
 10. 
 It had been pointed out to Rabocheye Dyelo that it minimised the tasks of the political struggle. 
 Its retort was that Iskra under-estimated the economic struggle. 
 It is pointed out to the new Iskra that it minimises the tasks of organising the revolution, the conduct of the uprising and the arming of the workers,and the participation of Social-Democracy in the pro-visional revolutionary government. 
 The new Iskra retorts that Vperyod underestimates the spontaneity of revolution and insurrection, the primacy of politics over “technique” (arming). 
 Like tail-ender views lead to like tail-ender con-clusions. 
 These people seek to cover up their inability toprovide a guiding slogan for the new tasks by moralising onthe importance of the old tasks. 
 Words are torn out ofcontext to show that the opponent himself appreciates theimportance of the old tasks, the significance of the ABC of Social-Democracy. 
 Of course, comrades of the new Iskra , we prize the ABC of Social-Democracy very highly, butwe do not want to remain at the abecedarian stage for ever . 
 Let this be plain. 
 Neither Parvus nor the Bureau of Commit-tees of the Majority nor Vperyod would ever think of disput-ing the elementary truth that the workers themselves can, will, and must arm, even without the organisations and the Party. 
 But if Iskra makes its famous “self-arming” a slogan —then, of course, everyone smiles at the sight of such a worshipful attitude towards spontaneity. 
 When Iskra , correcting Parvus, discovers a new task—worthy of the lucubrations of Krichevsky and Akimov—the task of “arming the workers with a sense of the burning necessity to arm”, it is only natural that it should meet with nothing but rid-icule. 
 If at a time when the new tasks of arming the masses,organising street fighting, etc. 
, have been added to the oldtasks of Social-Democracy, Iskra hastens to belittle these tasks (which we have scarcely begun to tackle) with its dis-paraging sophisms about “technique” and its secondary role; if instead of supplementing the old, customary, constant political tasks of the Party with the new tasks of “technique”, Iskra argues about the separation of the former from the latter, then, of course, everyone regards such arguments as a new variety of tail-ism. 
 In conclusion, as a curiosity, we would mention Iskra ’s attempt to discard its sterling reputation as the author ofthe famous no-panic-mongering theory. 
 Iskra itself now calls this a “famous” question and tries to prove that the Bureauof Committees of the Majority, too, advocates “no panic-mongering” when in its leaflet on the insurrection it recom-mends caution in destroying property belonging to pettybourgeois (except in cases of absolute necessity), so as not tofrighten them needlessly. 
 99 “Ah,” Iskra exults, “so you, too, do not want to frighten people!” Isn’t this just too precious? An agreement with the Zemstvo men not to cause a panic during a peaceful demon-stration is compared to a warning against the unwarranteddestruction of property during the uprising! In the firstcase, moreover, it is “demonstrations of a higher type”;in the second, the base, contemptible “technique” of armedstreet fighting.... 
 Just one slight question, friends: why is it that every Social-Democrat * agrees and will agree with the advice not to frighten the petty bourgeoisie need-lessly during an uprising? And why, on the other hand, didyour plan for a Zemstvo campaign become “famous” amongSocial-Democrats, by your own admission? Why didParvus and many others from your own ranks protest against it? Why are you yourselves to this very day ashamed to pub-lish this famous plan? Is it not because the advice containedin your notorious letter was as irrelevant and ridiculous asthe advice of the Bureau is indisputably correct and generallyaccepted by Social-Democrats? Vperyod , No. 
 15, Published according to April 20 (7), 1905 the text in Vperyod *So far only the anarchists have expressed their disagreement on this point. 
 They attacked Vperyod in their paper, revealing an absolute lack of understanding of the difference between a democratic and asocialist revolution. 
 THE AGRARIAN PROGRAMME OF THE LIBERALS The legal press reported some time ago that a conference of Zemstvo leaders from various parts of Russia had beenheld in Moscow. 
 Moskovskiye Vedomosti 100 even sought to give the alarm, shouting that the government was allowing revolutionary assemblies to be held in Russia, and that itwas necessary to call a congress of the monarchist party,etc. 
; but no one paid serious attention to these outcries,since the police these days have their hands full with affairsof a much more disturbing nature. 
 By all accounts, however, the Zemstvo men kept within the bounds of their usual constitutional aspirations. 
 Still, their conference proceedingswere of considerable interest, inasmuch as they compre-hended the agrarian question. 
 We quote in full the theseswhich, by the reports, were adopted by a majority of theconference: “1) State interference in the economic life should be extended to ag-rarian relations as well. 
 2) Proper agrarian legislation presumes a radi-cal change [??]. 
 3) The impending agrarian reform should be framed onthe following principles: I. 
 Improvement of the economic conditions ofthe farming class by the compulsory redemption of the necessary sup-plementary plots from private holdings for the benefit of the land-poorof various categories [the elaboration of this question has been entrusted to several persons]. 
 II. 
 Crown lands and some of the royal demesnes to be declared state lands; these state lands to be increased by the pur-chase and redemption of privately owned land and to be utilised forthe benefit of the labouring population. 
 III. 
 The conditions of lease tobe regulated through governmental intervention in the relationsbetween owners and tenants. 
 IV. 
 The establishment of public and state mediation commissions to enforce agrarian measures in accordance with the above-mentioned principles. 
 V.

 VI. 
 The radical revision of land-surveying legislation with a view to simplifying, facilitating, and cheapening demarcationabolishing the open-field system on privately owned lands and peasantallotments, making possible the exchange of lots, etc. 
” Before dealing with this most instructive programme point by point, let us dwell on its significance as a whole. 
Undoubtedly, the very fact that spokesmen of the landlordclass present such a programme proves more conclusivelythan lengthy arguments that Russia differs substantiallyin some respect from all the fully formed capitalist nations of Western Europe. 
 In what does this difference consist? Is it in the semi-socialist village communal system that pre-vails in our country with the corresponding absence of abourgeois intelligentsia and of bourgeois democracy, as theold Narodnik socialists used to think and as the “Socialists-Revolutionaries” still think to some extent? Or is it in the multitude of feudal survivals that enmesh our countryside, making it impossible for capitalism to develop widely andfreely and creating Narodnik moods precisely in bourgeois-democratic circles? This is a question no thinking socialistwill dismiss with evasive excuses, or on the grounds thatit is too abstract and theoretical, supposedly out of place in an epoch of revolution, or by reference to the fact of peasant uprisings as a sufficient explanation of the landlords’ com-plaisance. 
 Now, in the epoch of revolution, evasiveness orlack of principle in theoretical questions is tantamount toutter ideological bankruptcy; for now of all times a socialistrequires a well-thought-out and consistent world outlook, so that he may control the events and not the events him. 
 Reference to the peasant uprisings contributes nothingeither, for the programme now adopted by the landed pro-prietors, who are politically organised in Zemstvo unions,embodies the wishes which have been expressed for many adecade by the whole liberal press and by all liberal leaders. 
 The Narodnik programme has become the programme of the landlords—a fact that gives a clear political answer to thequestion we have raised. 
 In a revolutionary epoch theoreti-cal disputes over social issues are settled by the directaction of the diverse classes. 
 Let us now examine the agrarian programme of the liberals more closely. 
 Our legal press is inclined to sing its praises. 
 Economicheskaya Gazeta , for instance, “records the fact that the Zemstvo people have come forward with an agrarian programme that is incomparably more extreme [really!] than could have been expected, judging from theprevailing impression of the composition of the Zemstvo atthe present time” (extreme, that is, from the point of viewof the landlords?). 
 “This is evidence of the fact,” continuesthe article, “that the Zemstvo political group possesses both political tact and a deep understanding of what is taking place about us.... 
” The tact and the understanding of the landlords consist in the fact that when the peasants themselves began tointervene actively and definitely in agrarian relations,these landlords began to speak of the necessity of state interference. 
 The same old story! State intervention in agrarian relations has always been a fact in Russia. 
 Whenit was intervention in the interests of the upper classes,it was called in police parlance “order”; when the inter-vention comes from below, it is called “disorder”. 
 Yes, butwhat kind of intervention do the landlords want? Their programme shows that they want intervention exclusively to regulate the relations between owners and tenants. 
 Allthe measures which they propose, from redemption of sup-plementary plots to credit facilities and the exchange oflots, etc. 
, apply exclusively to those persons who use theland, i. 
e. 
, the various categories of farmers. 
 And what of the rural labourers who have no farms of their own? As far back as the nineties of the past century, in Russia’s fifty“interior” gubernias alone there were estimated to be nofewer than three and a half million farm-hands and day-labourers for whom farm employment was the principalmeans of earning a livelihood. 
 Today, the number of agri-cultural wage-labourers is undoubtedly still greater, and the overwhelming majority of them are entirely or almostentirely farmless. 
 Apart from those who possessed neitherhome nor farm, it was estimated that more than three mil-lion of the approximately ten million peasant farms in the stated gubernias possessed no horses; and that was ten years ago. 
 All these are farmers in name alone. 
 Their most vital interests lie in higher wages, shorter hours, andimproved working conditions. 
 The landlords are discreetly silent on the subject of intervention in the relations between employers and workers. 
 And we may rest assured that no one will give this kind of intervention serious thought until the rural workers themselves intervene. 
 We Social-Democrats must pay most serious attention to this kind of intervention. 
 Both the immediate practical interests of the movement and our general principles demandit. 
 The bourgeois-democratic nature of Russian liberalism and of Russian Narodism has always manifested itself, among other things, in the fact that the interests of smallfarming completely overshadow the interests of rural hiredlabour. 
 Of course, convinced Narodniks, and sometimes“Socialists-Revolutionaries”, are prone to regard this asquite natural in view of the “secondary” role (in their imagination, but not in actual peasant life) of hired labour, in view of the fact that with the further development of“village communal traditions”, “labour views”, and “equal-ised tenure”, this role might even be reduced to nought. 
 But this tendency, however earnest, sincere, and socialisticthe justifying speeches may be, is in fact a sign of nothing but petty-bourgeois narrow-mindedness. 
 This sort of day-dreaming, a quality possessed by both the Russian peasantand the Russian intellectual, is petty-bourgeois day-dream-ing. 
 The flowers of this Narodnik day-dreaming are the samefictitious flowers that decorate one of the chains of labouringmankind, and Social-Democratic criticism must ruthlessly pluck out such flowers, “not that man should continue to wear his chain bereft of all joy and pleasure, but that heshould throw off the chain and reach for the living flower. 
” 101 We are in full sympathy with the peasant movement. 
 We would consider it a tremendous gain both for the generalsocial development of Russia and for the Russian proletariat if the peasantry, with our help, succeeded in wresting from the landlords all their lands by revolutionary means. 
 But even assuming this most favourable outcome— even then , the mass of agricultural hired labourers would only tempo-rarily diminish in number but could in no event disappearaltogether. 
 Even then , the independent interests of the rural hired labourers would remain independent interests. 
 The transfer of the land to the peasants would not at all do away with the predominance of the capitalist mode of production in Russia; it would, on the contrary, provide a broader base for its development; it would bring this development from the type approximating the Italian closer to the American. 
 The property distinctions among the peas-ants, which are already tremendous, but relatively not verynoticeable chiefly on account of the general oppressionunder the absolutist serf-owning system, would not in anyway cease to exist. 
 The expansion of the home market, the development of exchange and commodity production on a new scale, the rapid growth of industry and of cities—all these inevitable effects of a substantial improvementin the condition of the peasants would unavoidablyincrease property distinctions. 
 The more illusions on that score arewidespread among us, the more energetically must the Social-Democrats combat them, if they really want to represent the interests of the working-class movement as awhole, and not merely of one of its stages. 
 * Until there has been a complete socialist revolution, not even the most radical and most revolutionary measuresfor agrarian reform will eliminate the class of agricultural wage-workers. 
 The dream of making all people petty-bour-geois is a reactionary platitude. 
 For this reason we shouldstart working now to develop the class-consciousness of therural wage-workers and to rally them into an independentclass organisation. 
 The strike wave in the towns can andshould spread to the villages, not only in the form of peasant uprisings, but in the form of real labour strikes, especially at mowing and harvesting time. 
 The demands contained inthe working-class section of our programme, which are sooften presented by the urban workers to their employers,must, with the corresponding changes necessitated by thedifferent living conditions, be put forward by the rural work-ers, too. 
 We must take advantage of the fact that so far there are no special laws in Russia degrading the position ofthe rural workers below that of the urban workers (exceptfor the law forbidding them to leave their work withoutpermission). 
 We must see to it that the rising tide of theproletarian movement creates a specifically proletarian mood *Cf. 
 Marx’s article of 1846 printed below. 
 (See pp. 
 323-29 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
) and proletarian methods of struggle among the farm-hands and day-labourers. 
 The petty-bourgeois stratum of the rural population, the peasantry in the strict and narrow sense of the word, cannothelp being revolutionary at certain periods in history. 
 Itspresent revolutionary attitude is an inevitable product ofthe conditions of the “old order”, and we must vigorouslysupport and develop it. 
 But it will follow just as inevitably from the conditions of the new order, of the new, free, capi-talist Russia, that part of the rural petty bourgeoisie willside with “order”; and the more land the peasants take awayfrom the landlords now, the sooner this will come about. 
 Inthe countryside, too, only the rural proletariat can be atruly revolutionary class, a class that, under all circum-stances, is revolutionary to the end. 
 The conversion of the wretched, downtrodden muzhik into a free, energetic Euro-pean farmer will be a tremendous democratic gain; but wesocialists shall not forget for a moment that this gain will beof no real use to the cause of mankind’s complete emancipa-tion from all oppression unless and insofar as the farmer is confronted by a class-conscious, free, and organised rural proletariat. 
 The liberal landlords keep quiet about the rural worker. 
 As far as the future farmer is concerned, their sole concernis to get him converted as quickly as possible, with theminimum loss to their pockets (it would, perhaps, be more correct to say with the maximum gain to their pockets), into their ally, into a man of property, a pillar of order. 
 Whatmiserable sops they hope to get off with! Their only revolu-tionary measure, the confiscation of the royal demesnes, isrestricted to a part of these lands; they are afraid to call confiscation confiscation, and say nothing about the church lands. 
 While promising supplementary plots to the land-poor, they firmly insist on redemption, with not a wordabout who should make the redemption payment. 
 Theyobviously take it for granted that the peasant will pay, as inthe case of the famed redemption of 1861. 
 The landlordswill give up their worst lands at exorbitant prices, which is what their supplementary endowments promise. 
 All the meas-ures they propose in regard to credits, co-operation, exchangeof lots, etc. 
, are restricted entirely to narrow proprietary interests. 
 With regard to leases—one of the most acute problems of peasant farming—they offer nothing but the vaguest of catchwords—“regulation”. 
 This may mean any-thing at all, even an increase in rents, on the pretext of stand-ardisation; we indicated above what the representativesof the ruling classes have always understood by “order”. 
 However, the most important and politically most dangerous feature of the liberal programme is, in our view, the clause concerning the “public and state mediation commis-sions”. 
 The method of realising the agrarian reform is amatter of great importance; for on the method of realisation,concretely and actually, will depend the earnest characterof the reform. 
 In regard to this question too (as in regard tomany others), we have the Narodniks to thank when we pay the main attention to the economic advantage, ignoring or underestimating the political aspect of the matter. 
 Thispoint of view, natural in a petty bourgeois, understandablein a farmer, is absolutely inadmissible in a Social-Demo-crat. 
 To the Social-Democrat shifts within the classes andcategories of farmers and proprietors are of no consequence unless accompanied by a political gain that facilitates the class struggle of the proletariat. 
 From the point of view ofpetty-bourgeois day-dreaming, all schemes for “equalisedtenure”, etc. 
, are important. 
 From the point of view of theSocial-Democrat, all such projects are idle and harmfulday-dreams that divert the public mind from the realities of real democratic gains. 
 The Social-Democrats will never forget that the ruling classes always and everywhere try todivide and corrupt the working people with economic sops. 
In the sphere of agrarian reform they find this policyparticularly easy and pursue it with particular skill. 
 All the more definitely and emphatically must we insist on the basic demand of our agrarian programme, namely, the establishment of revolutionary peasant committees thatwill themselves enforce really radical (not in the landlords’sense “radical”) agrarian reforms. 
 Short of this, everyagrarian reform will inevitably and inescapably be a new fraud,a new trap, like the famed “Reform” of 1861. 
 This is precisely what the “public [?] and state mediation commissions” are—the laying of a trap! By “public” we understand thelandlords; by “state”—the bureaucrats. 
 “Public and state commissions” means landlord s’ and bureaucrats ’ com-missions pure and simple. 
 That is the point on which we must immediately focus our agitation in the countryside. 
 Peasants, do you hear?They want once again to load you with benefits in truebureaucratic manner, to “regulate” your life by landlordintervention, to “redeem” land for you on the pattern ofthat old-time land redemption of dismal memory! The land-lords are so kind, so very kind: seeing that their lands are in danger of being taken away for nothing, they magnani-mously consent to sell them—at a suitable price, of course.... 
 Do you agree to such intervention on the part of land-lords and bureaucrats? Or do you want to intervene your-selves and build up a life of freedom for yourselves? Then unite with the urban proletariat, fight for the republic, arise for the insurrection which will bring you a revolution-ary government and revolutionary peasant committees! Vperyod , No. 
 15, Published according to April 20 (7), 1905 the text in Vperyod ON THE AMERICAN “GENERAL RE ” In Vperyod , No. 
 12, * there was a reference to Marx’s polemic against Kriege on the agrarian question. 
 The year was not 1848, as erroneously stated in the article by Comrade—, but 1846. 
 Hermann Kriege, a co-worker of Marxand at the time a very young man, had gone to America in1845 and there started a journal, the Volks-Tribun , for the propaganda of communism. 
 But he conducted this propa-ganda in such a manner that Marx was obliged to protest very strongly in the name of the German Communists against Hermann Kriege’s discrediting of the Communist Party. 
The criticism of Kriege’s trend, published in 1846 in West-phälische Dampfboot 102 and reprinted in Volume II of Mehring’s edition of Marx’s works, is of tremendous interestto present-day Russian Social-Democrats. 
 The point is that the agrarian question at that time had been brought to the fore by the course of the American socialmovement, as is the case now in Russia; it was not a questionof a developed capitalist society, but, on the contrary, ofthe creation of the primary and fundamental conditions for areal development of capitalism. 
 This circumstance is of particular importance for drawing a parallel between Marx’s attitude towards the American ideas of “general redistri-bution” and the attitude of Russian Social-Democratstowards the present-day peasant movement. 
 Kriege gave no data in his journal for a concrete study of the distinctive features of the American social system and for defining the true character of the movement of the *See p. 
 250 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 contemporary agrarian reformers who campaigned for the abolition of rent. 
 What Kriege did do, though (quite in the style of our “Socialists-Revolutionaries”), was to clothe the question of the agrarian revolution in bombastic andhigh-sounding phrases: “Every poor man,” wrote Kriege,“will become a useful member of human society as soon as heis given an opportunity to engage in productive work. 
 Hewill be assured such an opportunity for all time if society gives him a piece of land on which he can keep himself and his family.... 
 If this immense area (the 1,400,000,000 acres ofNorth American public domain) is withdrawn from commerceand is secured in restricted amounts for labour, * an end will be put to poverty in America at one stroke.... 
” To this Marx replies: “One would have expected him to understand that legislators have no power to decree that the evolution of the patriarchal system, which Kriege desires,into an industrial system be checked, or that the industrialand commercial states of the East coast be thrown back topatriarchal barbarism. 
” Thus, we have before us a real plan for an American gen-eral redistribution: the withdrawal of a vast land expanse from commerce, the securing of title to the land, limitationof the extent of landownership or land tenure. 
 And from thevery outset Marx subjects this utopianism to sober crit-icism, he points out that the patriarchal system evolvesinevitably into the industrial system, i. 
e. 
, to use present-day idiom, he points out the inevitability of the develop-ment of capitalism. 
 But it would be a great mistake to thinkthat the utopian dreams of the participants in the movementcaused Marx to adopt a negative attitude to the movementin general. 
 Nothing of the kind. 
 Already then, at the verybeginning of his literary activity, Marx was able to extract the real and progressive content of a movement from its tawdry ideological trappings. 
 In the second part of hiscriticism, entitled “The Economics [i. 
e. 
, the political economy] *Recall what Revolutsionnaya Rossiya , beginning with issue No. 
 8, wrote on the passing of the land from capital to labour, on theimportance of state lands in Russia, on equalised land tenure, on the bourgeois idea of drawing land into commercial transactions, etc. 
 Precisely like Kriege! of the Volks-Tribun and Its Attitude to Young America”, Marx wrote: “We fully recognise the historical justification of the move-ment of the American National Reformers. 
 We know thatthis movement strives for a result which, true, would givea temporary impetus to the industrialisation of modernbourgeois society, but which, as a product of the proletarianmovement, and as an attack on landed property in general, especially under prevailing American conditions, must inevitably lead, by its own consequences, to communism. 
Kriege, who with the German Communists in New York joinedthe Anti-Rent Bewegung [movement], clothes this simple fact in bombastic phrases, without entering into the contentof the movement, thereby proving that he is quite at sea as regards the connection between young America and Ameri-can social conditions. 
 We will cite another example of hisoutpouring of enthusiasm for humanity over the agrarians’plan for parcelling the land on an American scale. 
 “In issue No. 
 10 of the Volks-Tribun , in an article entitled ‘What We Want’, we read: ‘The American National Reform-ers call the land the common heritage of all men ... and demand that the national legislature pass measures topreserve the 1,400,000,000 acres of land not yet fallen intothe hands of the grabbing speculators, as the inalienablecommon property of the whole of mankind. 
’ In order topreserve for all mankind this ‘inalienable common property’, he accepts the plan of the National Reformers: ‘to provide every peasant, whatever country he may come from,with 160 acres of American land for his subsistence’; or, asit is expressed in issue No. 
 14, in ‘An Answer to Conze’: ‘Ofthese unappropriated public lands no one is to have a hold-ing in excess of 160 acres, and this only provided he tills it himself. 
’ Thus, in order to preserve the land as ‘inalienable common property’, and for ‘the whole of mankind’ besides, itis necessary immediately to begin parcelling it out. 
 Kriege,moreover, imagines that he can rule out the necessaryconsequences of this allotment—concentration, industrialprogress, and the like, by legislation. 
 He regards 160 acres of land as an invariable quantity, as though the value of such an area did not vary according to its quality. 
 The‘peasants’ will have to exchange the produce of the land, if not the land itself, among themselves and with others, and, having gone thus far, they will soon find that one ‘peasant’, even without capital, thanks to his labour and the greater original fertility of his 160 acres, has reduced another tothe position of his farm-hand. 
 Besides, what matters itwhether it is ‘the land’ or the produce of the land that‘falls into the hands of grabbing speculators’? Let us serious-ly examine Kriege’s gift to mankind. 
 One thousand four hundred million acres are to be preserved as the ‘inalienable common property of the whole of mankind’, with every‘peasant’ getting 160 acres. 
 We can therefore compute themagnitude of Kriege’s ‘mankind’: exactly 8,750,000 ‘peas-ants’, who, counting five to a family, represent 43,750,000people. 
 We can also compute the duration of the ‘for all time’ during which ‘the proletariat, as the representative of the whole of mankind’, at least in the U. 
S. 
A. 
, can layclaim to all the land. 
 If the population of the U. 
S. 
A. 
continues to increase at its present rate, i. 
e. 
, if it doublesin 25 years, then this ‘for all time’ will last something under40 years; by then these 1,400,000,000 acres will have been occupied, and future generations will have nothing to ‘lay claim to’. 
 But as the free grant of land would greatlyincrease immigration, Kriege’s ‘for all time’ might come to anend even sooner, particularly if it is borne in mind thatland for 44,000,000 people would not be an adequate outleteven for the pauperism existing in Europe today; for in Europe one out of every 10 persons is a pauper, and the British Isles alone account for 7,000,000 paupers. 
 A similarexample of naïveté in political economy is to be found inissue No. 
 13, in the article ‘To the Women’, in which Kriegesays that if the city of New York gave up its 52,000 acresof land on Long Island, this would suffice to rid New York of all pauperism, misery, and crime ‘at one stroke’ and for ever. 
 “Had Kriege regarded the movement for freeing the land as an early form of the proletarian movement, necessaryunder certain conditions, as a movement which, by reason ofthe position in social life of the class from which it emanates, must necessarily develop into a communist movement; had he shown why the communist aspirations in Americahad to manifest themselves initially in this agrarian form, which seems to contradict all communism, there would have been nothing to object to. 
 But he declares what is merely a subordinate form of a movement of definite, real people to be a cause of mankind in general. 
 He representsthis cause ... as the ultimate and highest aim of every move-ment in general, thus turning the definite aims of the move-ment into sheer bombastic nonsense. 
 In the same article(issue No. 
 10) he continues to chant his paean: ‘And so the old dreams of the Europeans would at last come true. 
 A place would be prepared for them on this side of the oceanwhich they would only have to take and to fructify with thelabour of their hands, so as to be able proudly to declare toall the tyrants of the world, ‘This is my cabin, which you have not built; this is my hearth whose glow fills your hearts with envy. 
’ “He might have added, This is my dunghill, which I, my wife, my children, my manservant, and my cattle have pro-duced. 
 And who are the Europeans whose ‘dreams’ wouldthus come true? Not the communist workers, but bankruptshopkeepers and handicraftsmen, or ruined cottars, who yearn for the good fortune of once again becoming petty bourgeois and peasants in America. 
 And what is the ‘dream’that is to be fulfilled by means of these 1,400,000,000 acres?No other than that all men be converted into private owners,a dream which is as unrealisable and as communistic as thedream to convert all men into emperors, kings, and popes. 
” Marx’s criticism is full of caustic sarcasm. 
 He scourges Kriege for those very aspects of his views which we nowobserve among our “Socialists-Revolutionaries”, namely,phrase-mongering, petty-bourgeois utopias represented asthe highest revolutionary utopianism, incomprehension ofthe real foundations of the modern economic system and its development. 
 With remarkable penetration, Marx, who was then only the future economist, points to the role of ex-change and commodity production. 
 The peasants, he says,will exchange the produce of the land, if not the land itself,and that says everything! The question is dealt with in a waythat is largely applicable to the Russian peasant movement and its petty-bourgeois “socialist” ideologists. 
 Marx, however, does not simply “repudiate” this petty-bourgeois movement, he does not dogmatically ignore it, he does not fear to soil his hands by contact with the movement of the revolutionary petty-bourgeois democrats—a fear that is characteristic of many doctrinaires. 
 While mercilessly ridiculing the absurd ideological trappings of the movement,Marx strives in a sober, materialist manner to determineits real historical content, the consequences that must inevitably follow from it because of objective conditions,regardless of the will and the consciousness, the dreams and the theories, of the various individuals. 
 Marx, therefore, does not condemn, but fully approves communist support ofthe movement. 
 Adopting the dialectical standpoint, i. 
e. 
,examining the movement from every aspect, taking intoaccount both the past and the future, Marx notes the revolu-tionary aspect of the attack on private property in land. 
 He recognises the petty-bourgeois movement as a peculiar initial form of the proletarian, communist movement. 
 Youwill not achieve what you dream of by means of this move-ment, says Marx to Kriege: instead of fraternity, you willget petty-bourgeois exclusiveness; instead of inalienablepeasant allotments, you will have the drawing of the land into commerce; instead of a blow at the grabbing speculators, you will witness the expansion of the basis for capitalistdevelopment. 
 But the capitalist evil you are vainly hoping toavoid is a historical benefit, for it will accelerate socialdevelopment tremendously and bring ever so much nearer newand higher forms of the communist movement. 
 A blow struck at landed property will facilitate the inevitable further blows at property in general. 
 The revolutionary action ofthe lower class for a change that will temporarily provide arestricted prosperity, and by no means for all, will facili-tate the inevitable further revolutionary action of the verylowest class for a change that will really ensure complete human happiness for all toilers. 
 Marx’s presentation of the case against Kriege should serve as a model for us Russian Social-Democrats. 
 That thepeasant movement in Russia today is of a really petty-bour-geois nature there can be no doubt. 
 We must explain this factby every means in our power, and we must ruthlessly and irreconcilably combat all the illusions of all the “Socialists-Revolutionaries” or primitive socialists on this score. 
 Theorganisation of an independent party of the proletariat which, through all democratic upheavals, will strive for the complete socialist revolution, must be our constant aim, not to be lost sight of for a moment. 
 But to turn away from the peasant movement for this reason would be sheer philistinismand pedantry. 
 No, there is no doubt as to the revolutionaryand democratic nature of this movement, and we must withall our might support it, develop it, make it a politicallyconscious and definitely class movement, advance it, and go hand in hand with it to the end—for we go much further than the end of any peasant movement; we go to the veryend of the division of society into classes. 
 There is hardlyanother country in the world where the peasantry is experi-encing such suffering, such oppression and degradation asin Russia. 
 The worse this oppression has been, the more powerful will now be the peasantry’s awakening, the more irresistible its revolutionary onset. 
 The class-consciousrevolutionary proletariat should support this onset with allits might, so that it may leave stand no stone of this old,accursed, feudal, autocratic, and slavish Russia; so that itmay create a new generation of free and courageous people, a new republican country in which our proletarian struggle for socialism will be able freely to expand. 
 Vperyod , No. 
 15, Published according to April 20 (7), 1905 the text in Vperyod THE COUNCIL IS CAUGHT OUT A reprint of the decision of the “Party Council” from Iskra , No. 
 95, dated Geneva, April 7, 1905, has just appeared. 
 This decision is a veritable maze of “deviations from the truth”. 
 Let us consider the major ones. 
 We are told that the Council has taken care not to let the inner struggle in the Party undermine its unity. 
 This is untrue. 
 All Party members should know from unrefutedand irrefutable documents that over a year ago, in January1904, Lenin and Vasilyev, members of the Central Commit-tee, proposed in the Council that a call be issued to the entire Party to stop the boycott and the secret appropriation ofParty funds by the circles. 
 * The Council rejected their proposal . 
 Instead, it participated directly in the secret split of the Party, thus sanctioning the struggle of the secretorganisation of the Minority for “co-optation”. 
 This struggle, as is now proved by documentary evidence, had been going on since the Second Congress, viz. 
, from August 1903 toNovember or December 1904. 
 Thus, from January 1904 on, the Council was no longer the supreme Party body, but a tool of the secret organisa-tion of the Minority. 
 The existence of this organisation was admitted publicly and in print, not only by the concilia-tory C. 
C. 
, but even by Iskra , at the time when the C. 
C. 
 sided with the Minority. 
 As a tool of the Minority’s secret organisation, the Council has exerted all efforts to evade the demand of the committeesfor an all-Party congress. 
 For eighteen months Social Democratic activities in Russia were hampered by the dis-*See present edition, Vol. 
 7, pp. 
 145-47. 
— Ed. 
 ruptive tactics of the Minority abroad. 
 For eighteen months the committees in Russia waged an intense unremitting struggle for a congress against the Geneva Council, which either pigeonholed the committees’ resolutions or returnedthem with insulting remarks (“blackguards, sheer humbug,fabrication of documents” are the-expressions contained in aletter by Martov; see Orlovsky’s pamphlet The Council Against the Party ). 
 Every important step in this painful struggle against the machinations of the promoters of the secret split is now documented in Party literature. 
 As farback as October 1904, i. 
e. 
, six months ago , it was proved— e. 
g. 
, in Orlovsky’s The Council Against the Party — that the Council, without offering reasons, had refrainedfrom convening the Congress, although called upon to do 90 by the Party Rules. 
 After that, one Party committee in Russia after another formally voiced no confidence i n t he Council and in all the central bodies. 
 The Council, how-ever, ignored these actions and with no sense of shameflouted the Party. 
 The Council was a tool of the Minority. 
Now the Council, in its decision of April 7, 1905, has open-ly declared itself a party to the dispute , but at the same time it has had no scruples about using the title, the rights, andthe powers of an all-Party body, and it has refused to return to the Party the mandate it has received from it. 
 The thinghas been a flagrant breach of confidence from beginning toend. 
 When, finally, the Party committees in Russia, seeing that the Council was evading the Congress, themselves called the Congress through the “Bureau” which they had elected at three conferences, even the C. 
C. 
 , which had gone over to the Minority , hastened to rectify its mistake. 
 The C. 
C. 
 in Russia , which not only did not sympathise with the Committees of the Majority but actually combated them, upon seeing how matters stood in Russia and knowing the Majority to be really preponderant there, had to admit thatthe Bureau of Committees of the Majority had been abso-lutely impartial in convening the Congress and had had torebel against the Council . 
 In its appeal of March 12, 1905, to the, general membership of the Party, the C. 
C. 
 in Rus-sia, as we noted in the press and as all Party workers inRussia know from the declaration, openly rebelled against /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR the Council ; it declared in Point 5 of the declaration that “the March 8 resolution of the Council ( Iskra , No. 
 89) against the Congress is not considered grounds for halting organisation work for the Congress”. 
 What is the significance of this announcement, which our Council so studiously passes over? The significance is thatthe C. 
C. 
 in Russia, knowing Russian affairs and, evidently,having investigated the assertions of the Council abroad, designates the assertions as untrue and the pretexts for not convening the Congress as pure invention; it considers as aproved fact that the demand for the Congress has the support of the overwhelming majority of the Russian committeesthat had a chance to study the facts of the case. 
 Hence, the silence of our Council regarding the declara-tion made by the C. 
C. 
 in Point 5! For it is in effect a direct admission to the whole Party membership that the Councilhas made false allegations, that it has misrepresented thegeneral opinion of the Party! In vain, therefore, does the Council attempt to mislead the Party once more by proposing conferences and agreements between the disputants. 
 In Russia such an agreement has already been reached . 
 The centre of the Mensheviks in Russia was the Central Committee; Iskra itself admitted as much in its announcement that the July declaration of theC. 
C. 
 had been accepted by the Menshevik organisations. 
 Thecentre of the Majority in Russia was the Bureau of Com-mittees of the Majority. 
 The Russian centres of both sides to the dispute have agreed to hold a joint congress . 
 It is evident from this that there are Mensheviks in Russia whoset a slightly higher value on the Party spirit and Partyunity than do the Mensheviks abroad. 
 It is evident that theRussian Mensheviks themselves, as represented by their centre, the C. 
C. 
, expose the Council abroad and turn their backs on it. 
 It is evident that after an agreement has beenreached between the Russian centres of the disputants, anyagreement with the Council abroad, i. 
e. 
, with the gentlemensitting in Geneva, is entirely out of the question. 
 In vain, therefore, does our Council speak of its deposition by the C. 
C. 
 in the future tense. 
 It is not a matter of the future but of the past. 
 Point 5 of the C. 
C. 
’s appeal tothe Party, dated March 12, 1905, proves to all who can under-stand what they read that this deposition has actually taken place. 
 Russia, represented by the united centres of the two sides, has overthrown the group abroad. 
 The Party Council now represents merely the Geneva group and notthe Party. 
 How accurately this describes the state of affairs in the Party may be seen very clearly from the following. 
 TheCouncil declares that its decision of April 7, 1905, was adopted unanimously. 
 Party members who read this are, of course, supposed to believe that the two members of the C. 
C. 
 on the Council also had a hand in this decision. 
 How-ever, any such idea, which the Council tries to inspire in thereaders, is very much open to question. 
 The proof: As we stated in Vperyod , No. 
 13, we are not yet authorised to publish the agreement between the Bureau of Committees of the Majority and the C. 
C. 
 Still, we wereinformed that at least one point of the agreement might bemade public, should the Party Council decide againstconvening the Third Party Congress. 
 This eventuality has now arisen. 
 We, therefore, now publish this point—Point 1 of the unpublished agreement. 
 “Agreement between the Bureau of Committees of the Majority and the Central Committee , signed March 12, 1905 . 
 “Point 1 . 
 The Organising Committee composed of represent-atives of the Central Committee and of the Bureau of Committees of the Majority shall organise the Third Party Congress immediately, regardless of any resolution theCouncil may adopt on the convocation of the Congress. 
” Clear enough, it would seem. 
The C. 
C. 
 expressly stipulated that it would refuse to abide by any future resolutions of the Council, without making this public for the time being, in the hope that the Council might for once act honestly. 
 This means that theRussian Mensheviks still believed it possible for the Coun-cil to do the right thing, even if by way of exception. 
 The Russian Mensheviks, represented by their Russian centre, have now been disillusioned. 
 Hence, it is now proved conclusively that even the C. 
C. 
 whose sympathies were entirely on the side of the Council,was compelled to expose its colleague abroad to the full. 
 It now remains for us in conclusion to put one small ques-tion to the reader: In view of all this, what is one to think of the members of the Council sitting in Geneva, who have declared publicly, in print, that the Council decision datedGeneva, April 7, 1905, had been adopted unanimously? Vperyod , No.

S.

L. 
P. 
103 Dear Comrade, On April 4 (17), the Central Committee notified the Party Council that it had appointed Comrades Johansen104 and Valerian105 to represent it on the Council and requested that a meeting of the Council as constituted in conformitywith the Party Rules be called in the immediate future. 
 Having received no reply to this request, we took the lib-erty of approaching you a second time, and on April 22 (9) we received an answer in which you refused to call ameeting of the Council as long as we “go on acting asviolators of the Party Rules and usurpers of the Council’sfunctions”. 
 The situation arising from your refusal to call an official meeting of the Council prevents us from presenting a number of communications to the Party Council; and since, in ouropinion, it is impossible to withhold them any longer, weare obliged to address ourselves to you before the wholeParty membership with a written recital of the main state-ments that we intended to submit to the next meeting of the Council. 
 1. 
 The Central Committee informs the Party Council that up to April 4 (17) the following qualified Party organisationswent on record for the Third Party Congress: the St. 
 Peters-burg, Moscow, Northern League, Nizhni-Novgorod, Tver,Tula, Riga, Siberian League, Voronezh, Saratov, Odessa, Caucasian League (8 votes), Nikolayev, Ural, Orel-Bryansk, Kursk, Smolensk, Polesye, North-Western, Kharkov, andSamara committees—a total of 21 organisations, entitled to 48 votes. 
 The C. 
C. 
 also declared itself in favour of calling the Congress and decided to send a delegate, as well as its representatives on the Party Council, to the Congress. 
 From the Astrakhan, Kazan, Kuban, and Don commit-tees, from the League of the Mining and Metal District, fromthe Ekaterinoslav Committee, from the Crimean League,from the League, from the Editorial Board of the CentralOrgan, and from the three members of the Council residing abroad either no resolutions were received or the resolutions received declared the convening of the Congress to be undesir-able. 
 Finally, the Kiev Committee, although it had adopted a resolution against the Congress on March 25, subsequentlyelected a delegate to the Congress and sent him abroad. 
 Thus, out of the 75 votes * that would represent the whole Party at the Congress, 52 (not counting the Kiev Commit-tee) were in favour of convening the Third Party Congress. 
 Under these circumstances the C. 
C. 
 deems it necessary to insist, through its representatives on the Party Council,that the Council immediately fulfil its formal obligation, in accordance with Clause 2 of the Party Rules, to convene the Congress when this is demanded by Party organisationscommanding aggregately half the total voting strength ofthe Congress. 
 Since, according to the information of the C. 
C. 
, many more votes have now been cast for the Congress than are required by the Rules (52 out of 75), the Council must immediately and unconditionally give notice of the convening of theCongress, without stipulating any prior conditions ordemands not provided for in the Party Rules. 
 2. 
 The Central Committee is profoundly convinced that, even granting the fullest sincerity of all Council members, a question of such extraordinary importance as the conven-ing of the Party Congress, at a time such as the Party andall Russia are now living through, cannot be decided onpurely formal grounds. 
 Our Party Rules are not explicitenough for that. 
 Thus, they give no answer to the questionof the time limit within which the Party Council is obliged to convene the Congress after the required number of *See the list of qualified organisations published in Iskra , No. 
 89. 
 votes in favour has been cast. 
 Respecting this and other ques-tions, the central bodies of the Party are obliged to resort to an interpretation of the Rules and act not only in keeping with the formally expressed will of the Party, which, as isevident from Clause 1, has declared in favour of the Congress,but in conformity with the actual state of affairs in the Partyas well as in Russia generally. 
 The C. 
C. 
 considers it its duty to inform the Party Council that the Party crisis in Russia has grown to such dimensions that Party work has been brought to an almost completestandstill. 
 The situation in the committees has reached theheight of confusion. 
 There is hardly a single question oftactics or organisation that does not provoke the most vio-lent dissension locally between the groups, more often than not because the disputants belong to different camps in the Party rather than on essential matters. 
 Neither the PartyCouncil, nor the Central Organ, nor the C. 
C. 
 has sufficientprestige with the majority of the Party workers; dual organi-sations are springing up everywhere, hampering each other’swork and discrediting the Party in the eyes of the proletar-iat. 
 To comrades active chiefly as publicists, whose work can go on uninterrupted even in an atmosphere of mistruston the part of a large portion of the Party membership, thepresent unbearable, blind-alley situation in which generalParty matters stand is perhaps not so apparent as to theParty workers of the practical centre, who come daily up against increasing difficulties in their work in Russia. 
 The time has come when the growth of the internal contradic-tions in our Party life begins to tax the narrow and, as wecan all see now, far from perfect framework of the Ruleswhich the Second Party Congress has given us. 
 New forms areneeded, or at least a modification of the old; and this can only be done by the sole lawgiver of the Social-Democratic Party—the Party Congress, since it and it alone has theright to establish rules binding on all , rules that cannot be imposed by any conference, or any local agreement. 
 Realis-ing the importance of resolving the Party crisis by means ofan immediate congress, the majority of the committees in Russia have taken all the necessary steps for the convening of the Congress as soon as possible, including the electionand the sending of delegates; this applies not only to the committees of the Majority, which had previously declared for the Congress, but also to the greater part of the Minor-ity committees, of the groups and the periphery organisa-tions. 
 The Party has declared for the Congress and hasexpended considerable means and efforts in preparation forit. 
 The central bodies of the Party have no formal right topostpone notice of the Congress now that the obligation toconvene it is incontestable, and they are morally bound to do their utmost to ensure that the Party’s expenditure of energy shall not have been wasted. 
 To keep scores of dele-gates, our most active comrades, abroad indefinitely, whenthey are so badly needed in Russia, or still worse, to havethem go back to Russia from a congress not held because thecomrades of the Central Organ refused to forego the letter of the Party Rules for the spirit, for the higher interest of preserving Party unity, would be an unpardonable waste ofParty forces and would mean that the leaders of the Partyfell short of the tasks which Party life has put before them. 
When forms have outlived themselves, when a growing anddeveloping Party feels cramped in these forms, we cannot remedy things by harping for the hundredth time on the sanctity of the letter of the law. 
 That is no way out of thecrisis; the only possible solution is to call the PartyCongress. 
 3. 
 On the strength of Clause 6 of the Party Rules which empowers it to organise and conduct all activities of general Party importance, the C. 
C. 
 insists upon its right, inalienable and not subject to restriction, to take all the preparatorymeasures and to perform all the practical work involved inthe organisation of Party congresses. 
 The C. 
C. 
, as the onlypractical centre of the Party, considers all attempts of otherParty bodies to interfere in this work a breach of the Party Rules, and it protests against them as an encroachment upon its rights. 
 As for the rights granted to the Party Councilin Clause 2 of the Rules with regard to the convocation ofParty congresses, the C. 
C. 
 interprets them to mean that theCouncil shall give notice of such convocation and controlthe work actually done by the C. 
C. 
 In view of the foregoing, the C. 
C. 
 admits that its agree-ment with the Bureau of Committees of the Majority to callthe Third Party Congress contravenes the Party Rules only insofar as it expresses (see Point 1 of the agreement) the intention of convening the Congress even without prior official notice by the Party Council. 
 4. 
 Having received word that eighteen qualified Party organisations, apart from the C. 
C. 
 itself, had passed resolu-tions in favour of convening the Third Congress, the C. 
C. 
,on March 12, decided to bring this to the attention of theCouncil, to whom it sent the following statement: “The Central Committee notifies the Party Council that to date (March 12) eighteen qualified Party committees (besidesthe C. 
C. 
), or more than half the total voting strength at theThird Congress under the Party Rules, have declared infavour of convening the Third Party Congress. 
 Similarresolutions from several other committees are expected in the very near future. 
 Under the circumstances the C. 
C. 
 deems it necessary to convene the Congress immediately and asks theParty Council to give due notice of its convocation byadopting a corresponding resolution. 
 All documents in thepossession of the C. 
C. 
 relating to this question will be submit-ted to the Party Council in the near future. 
” Besides this, the C. 
C. 
, as early as March 10, instructed its agent, Comrade Vadim, 106 to go abroad immediately in order to report the situation to the Party Council, to which he had beenaccredited by the C. 
C. 
 Owing to an unfortunate coincidence,Comrade Vadim was arrested before he reached the frontier. 
As for the document cited above, in which the C. 
C. 
 records the receipt of resolutions that oblige the Council to give immediate notice of the Congress, we find that, accordingto private information received on April 4 (17) fromComrade Deutsch by the members of the C. 
C. 
, ComradesJohansen and Valerian, it was not received at all. 
 AfterwardsComrade Deutsch corrected this information, stating that the document had been received at Locarno, but only after the Council’s meeting of April 7. 
 Since we, the representa-tives of the C. 
C. 
, were barred from the session of the Coun-cil, we are not in a position to determine why there was sucha delay in delivering the C. 
C. 
’s statement to the Councilmembers. 
 However, even if it was received after the meeting of the three Council members at Locarno, the document, which established a clear case for the convocation of theCongress, was of such importance that the comrades from the Central Organ and the fifth member of the Council should have met immediately and taken the decision prescribed by the Party Rules, or, at least, in view of the failure of the C. 
C. 
 representative to arrive because of his arrest beforereaching the frontier, they should have held up publicationof the resolution of April 7. 
 5. 
 The C. 
C. 
 questions the validity of the decisions which the Party Council has adopted since February 1905, because after the return of Comrades B. 
 and Vtorov 107 from abroad at the end of January, the C. 
C. 
 did not accredit anyone tothe Party Council. 
 Long before the present conflict betweenthe C. 
C. 
 and the Council members abroad, specifically, onFebruary 14, 1904, a plenary meeting of the C. 
C. 
 adopteda decision construing Clause 4 of the Party Rules relating to the representation of the C. 
C. 
 on the Council to mean that the members of the C. 
C. 
 who are delegated to theCouncil must be accredited by the C. 
C. 
 as a body, and thateven members of the C. 
C. 
 who for one reason or another areabroad have no right to attend meetings of the Councilunless a resolution to that effect has been adopted by a plenary meeting of the C. 
C. 
 This explanatory decision of the C. 
C. 
 has served as the basis for representation of the C. 
C. 
 abroad. 
 Since February1904 all representatives of the C. 
C. 
 without exception havesat in the Party Council only after having previously beenendorsed by a plenary meeting of the C. 
C. 
 Comrades Gle-bov and Lenin, Comrade Glebov in the course of his second stay abroad, Comrade Bem, who was the C. 
C. 
 representativeon the Council until his departure for Russia, ComradeVtorov, who went abroad in January with authority tonegotiate certain questions with the Editorial Board of theCentral Organ and to attend the meetings of the Council, all received their credentials, not from any member of the C. 
C. 
 or from his predecessor on the Party Council, but from aplenary meeting of the C. 
C. 
 The reason that prompted theC. 
C. 
 to reach the mentioned decision of February 14, 1904,and to adhere to it so rigidly in its entire subsequent practicewas that such a method of organising the representation of the C. 
C. 
 on the Council was the only way to prevent com-rades who are not in close enough touch with the C. 
C. 
 and notfamiliar in detail with its policy on all questions of Party life from speaking at the Party Council in the name of the C. 
C. 
 We go further: the provision that only a plenary meet-ing of the C. 
C. 
 could appoint the two Council members was the sole means whereby the centre working in Russia couldhave anything like parity of influence in the Party Councilwith the comrades from the Central Organ, who preponder-ate in the Council not only numerically, but also in point ofauthority, which some of them have won through long years of honourable service in the front ranks of Social-Democracy, both Russian and international. 
 With all due respect tothese comrades on the Council, the C. 
C. 
 would, however,fail in its duty to the entire Party if it permitted, even for ashort time, a change in the composition of the Party Councilwhereby all questions would be decided by a body consisting exclusively of comrades, who, worthy and respected though they be, cannot by dint of circumstances be in directcontact with the real practical work carried on in Russia. 
Since our request for a meeting of the Council was denied,we could not determine on what grounds Comrade Deutsch,whom Comrade Vtorov had appointed C. 
C. 
 representative pro tem . 
 on the “Technical Committee” abroad, considered himself entitled to speak at the Party Council in the nameof the C. 
C. 
, with whose activities in Russia he never hadany contact. 
 The C. 
C. 
 declares Comrade Deutsch’s actionto be invalid, since it was not authorised by the C. 
C. 
;even assuming that Comrade Vtorov (at that time only an agent of the C. 
C. 
) or any member of the C. 
C. 
 had asked Comrade Deutsch to represent it on the Party Council, thiswill not cure the illegality of Comrade Deutsch’s position,since such authorisation can be granted only by a plenarymeeting of the C. 
C. 
, which was not done in the case ofComrade Deutsch. 
 On the grounds aforesaid, the C. 
C. 
 considers all decisions of the Party Council subsequent to the depar-ture from abroad of Comrades Bem and Vtorov to have beentaken wholly without the participation of the C. 
C. 
 anddemands a reconsideration of all questions at a new meetingto which the rightful representatives of the C. 
C. 
 shall beinvited. 
 6. 
 The C. 
C. 
 denies the right of the Party Council to pass judgement on any of the centres and to demand from themabsolute submission to all its decisions. 
 According to the Rules, the function of the Council is to co-ordinate and unify the activities of the C. 
C. 
 and of the Editorial Board of the Central Organ. 
 However, in the event of a conflict between one of the centres and the Council, obviously only aspecial Party congress can settle the dispute. 
 The word ofthe Party Council cannot be final in case of a disagreementbetween itself and one of the centres, since then the Councilwould simultaneously be both judge and a party to the dis-pute. 
 However, as a result of the refusal to call a meeting of the Party Council with the participation of C. 
C. 
 repre-sentatives, the C. 
C. 
 is not only condemned by the threemembers of the Council (editors of the Central Organ) buteven penalised by being deprived of its inalienable right,guaranteed by the Party Rules, to be represented in the Party Council. 
 Still other measures are being taken to force the C. 
C. 
 to submit under all circumstances to the decisions of the threemembers of the Council (editors of the Central Organ). 
 Thus,in reply to the C. 
C. 
’s legitimate demand to its own agentabroad, Comrade Deutsch, that all its technical and financial affairs be handed over to Comrade Valerian, the member of the C. 
C. 
 entrusted by it with assum-ing charge of them, Comrade Deutsch, refused, givingas his reason the conflict between the C. 
C. 
 and theCouncil. 
 Thus, while the C. 
C. 
 in Point 1 of its agreement with the Bureau of Committees of the Majority expressed its willingness to convene the Congress even in the event of arefusal on the part of the Council and thus came into con-flict with the Rules, the three Council members in their turnbroke the Rules twice by depriving the C. 
C. 
 of its right toparticipate in the Council and to manage and control its own technical and financial undertakings abroad (a breach of Clauses 2 and 6 of the Party Rules). 
 In placing before the Party this conflict (for which the Party Rules provide no solution) between the Party Coun-cil (represented only by two members from the Central Organand the fifth member of the Council), on the one side, and the C. 
C. 
 on the other, the C. 
C. 
, in view of the refusal of Comrade Plekhanov Chairman of the Party Council, tocall a meeting of that body, declares that by this action, which is a flagrant breach of the Rules, the Chairman of the Council makes it impossible for the Council to function and, in effect, wilfully annuls the Party Council. 
 Absolute submission of the C. 
C. 
 to the Party Council, on which you, comrade, insist, as the sine qua non for call-ing a meeting of the Council, actually amounts to postpon-ing the Congress indefinitely and flouting the clearlyexpressed will of the Party. 
 Placing its loyalty to the Party above loyalty to three foreign-resident members of the Council, the C. 
C. 
 submitsthe entire conflict to the judgement of the Party itself.

 94, a retort of abuse and hysteria, further personal suspi-cions, fairy-tales about the strength of the Minority groups,and so on. 
 Naturally, we ignore all these tricks, which areworthy of the famous League Congress. 
 Strictly speaking,only two points are worth taking up. 
 If the Congress does take place, says Iskra , it will be only as a conference of separated trends . 
 In other words, the new-Iskrists admit their break-away from the Party, they admit the splitas an accomplished fact. 
 We would always prefer this frankadmission to a sneaking secret split. 
 But how do you makethis out, gentlemen? You admit yourselves to be one part of the Party that has broken away from the other and yet modestly retain the titles and ranks that belong to the wholeParty (“Central Organ”, “Council”) and at the same timeyou keep the money which comrades abroad have collectedfor the whole Party, you keep the printing-house, whichbelongs to the whole Party! * Is this honourable? Secondly, Iskra usually considers the Party to be split when it is a question of the centres reporting to the Party,while considering the Party to be united when the issue isthe power of the centres over the Party. 
 The very thing isnow happening again.

 Written prior to April 12 (25), 1905 First published in 1931 Published according to in Lenin Miscellany XVI the manuscript RUSSIAN SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC LABOUR PARTY Workers of All Countries, Unite! THE FIRST OF MAY 108 Comrades workers! The great holiday of the workers of all the world is coming. 
 On the First of May they celebratetheir awakening to light and knowledge, their associationin one fraternal union for the struggle against all oppression, against all tyranny, against all exploitation, for a socialist system of society. 
 All who work, who feed the rich and thenobility by their labour, who spend their lives in back-breaking toil for scanty wages, who never enjoy the fruits oftheir own labour, who live like beasts of burden amidst theluxury and splendour of our civilisation—all stretch out their hands to fight for the emancipation and happiness of the workers. 
 Down with enmity between workers of differ-ent nationalities or different creeds! This enmity can onlybenefit the plunderers and tyrants, who live by the igno-rance and disunion of the proletariat. 
 Jews and ChristiansArmenians and Tatars, Poles and Russians, Finns and Swedes, Letts and Germans—all, all of them march to-gether under the one common banner of socialism. 
 All work-ers are brothers, and their solid union is the only guaranteeof the well-being and happiness of all working and oppressedmankind. 
 On the First of May this union of the workers of allcountries, international Social-Democracy, reviews its forces and gathers its strength for a further unremitting and unswerving struggle for freedom, equality, and fraternity. 
 Comrades! We stand now in Russia on the eve of great events. 
 We are engaged in the last desperate fight withthe autocratic tsarist government, we must carry this fighton to its victorious end. 
 See what calamities this govern-ment of brutes and tyrants, of venal courtiers and hangers-on of capital, has brought upon the entire Russian people!The tsarist government has plunged the Russian people into an insane war against Japan. 
 Hundreds of thousands of young lives have been torn away from the people to perish in the Far East. 
 Words cannot describe all the calamities that this war brings upon us. 
 And what is the warfor? For Manchuria, which our predatory tsarist governmenthas seized from China! Russian blood is being shed and ourcountry ruined for the sake of foreign territory. 
 Life isbecoming harder and harder for the workers and peasants; the capitalists and officials keep tightening the noose round their necks, while the tsarist government is sending thepeople out to plunder foreign territory. 
 Bungling tsaristgenerals and venal officials have led to the destruction of theRussian fleet, squandered hundreds and thousands of millionsof the nation’s wealth, and lost entire armies, but the war still goes on, claiming further sacrifices. 
 The people are being ruined, industry and trade are coming to a standstill, andfamine and cholera are imminent; but the autocratic govern-ment in its blind madness follows the old path; it is readyto ruin Russia if only it can save a handful of brutes andtyrants; it is launching another war besides the one with Japan—war against the entire Russian people. 
 Never before has Russia experienced such an awakening from her slumber, from her oppression and enslavement, asshe is experiencing today. 
 All classes of society are stirring,from the workers and peasants to the landlords and capital-ists, and voices of protest have been raised everywhere, in St. 
 Petersburg and the Caucasus, in Poland and Siberia. 
 Everywhere the people demand an end to the war; theydemand the establishment of a free people’s rule, the convoca-tion of deputies of all citizens without exception in a Con-stituent Assembly to institute a people’s government and savethe nation from the abyss into which the tsarist government is pushing it. 
 Workers of St. 
 Petersburg, about two hundred thousand strong, went to the tsar on Sunday, the Ninth ofJanuary, with the priest Georgi Gapon in order to submitthese demands of the people. 
 The tsar received the workersas enemies. 
 He shot down thousands of unarmed workers inthe streets of St. 
 Petersburg. 
 The struggle is now on all over Russia. 
 Workers are on strike, demanding freedom and a better life. 
 Blood is being spilt in Riga and in Poland, onthe Volga and in the South. 
 Everywhere the peasants are rising. 
 The struggle for freedom is becoming the struggle of the entire people. 
 The tsarist government has gone mad. 
 It wants to bor-row money to carry on the war, but no one will trust itwith a loan any longer. 
 It promises to convene representativesof the people, but actually everything remains unchanged;the persecutions do not cease, the lawlessness of theofficials proceeds as before; there are no free public meetings, no freely circulated people’s newspapers; the prisons in which fighters for the working-class cause are languishinghave not been thrown open. 
 The tsarist government is tryingto set one people against another. 
 It has brought about amassacre in Baku by maligning the Armenians among theTatars; now it is preparing a fresh massacre aimed at the Jews by fanning hatred against them among the ignorant people. 
 Comrades workers! We will tolerate no longer such out-rageous treatment of the Russian people. 
 We will rise todefend freedom, we will strike back at all who try to deflectthe wrath of the people from the real enemy. 
 We will riseup in arms to overthrow the tsarist government and win free-dom for the entire people. 
 To arms, workers and peasants! HoId secret meetings, form fighting squads, get whateverweapons you can, send trusted men to consult with the Rus-sian Social-Democratic Labour Party! Let this year’s Firstof May be for us the celebration of the people’s uprising, letus prepare for it and await the signal for the decisive attack on the tyrant. 
 Down with the tsarist government! We will overthrow it and set up a provisional revolutionary govern-ment to convene a Constituent Assembly of the people. 
Let people’s deputies be elected by universal, direct, andequal vote, through secret ballot. 
 Let all fighters for freedombe released from prison or brought back from exile. 
 Let pub-lic meetings be held openly and people’s newspapers be print-ed without surveillance by the accursed officials. 
 Let all thepeople arm, let a rifle be given to every worker, so that thepeople themselves, not a handful of plunderers, may decidetheir own destiny. 
 Let free peasants’ committees be set up inthe countryside to overthrow the serf-owning landlord power, to free the people from the hateful oppression of the offi-cials, to restore to the peasants the land that has been takenaway from them. 
 This is what the Social-Democrats want, this is what they call upon you to fight for, arms in hand: for complete free-dom, for the democratic republic, for the eight-hour day, for peasants’ committees. 
 Prepare then for the great battle,comrades workers, stop work in the factories and mills onthe First of May, or take up arms according to the advice ofthe committees of the Social-Democratic Labour Party. 
 Thehour of the insurrection has not yet struck, but it is not far off now. 
 The workers of the world are now looking with bated breath to the heroic Russian proletariat which has offeredincalculable sacrifices to the cause of freedom. 
 The St. 
Petersburg workers proclaimed on the famed Ninth of Jan-uary: Freedom or death! Workers of all Russia, we willrepeat that great battle-cry, we will not shrink from any sac-rifices: through the uprising we will win freedom; through freedom, socialism! Long live the First of May, long live international revolu-tionary Social-Democracy! Long live the freedom of the workers and peasants, long live the democratic republic! Down with the tsarist autocracy! 1905 Bureau of Committees of the MajorityEditorial Board of “Vperyod ” Written prior to April 12 (25), 1905 Published in 1905 Published according to as a separate leaflet the text of the leaflet THE CONSTITUTIONAL MARKET-PLACE Bulygin, as the St. 
 Petersburg aristocratic circles justly remark, is now playing for time. 
 He is trying to postponethe reforms promised by the tsar as long as possible, and to reduce them to trifles that will in no way diminish the power of the autocratic tsar and of autocratic officialdom. 
 In placeof a constitution, he is preparing, as we pointed out oncebefore in Vperyod , * a consultative body enjoying no rights whatever. 
 Now we have confirmation of what we said, name-ly, the text of Bulygin’s project published in the German liberal newspaper Vossische Zeitung . 
 According to that news-paper, Bulygin, Yermolov, Shcherbatov, Meshchersky,Count Sheremetyev, and Prince Urusov have been mentionedas authors of the project, which in substance is as follows: For the discussion (no more than that!) and the drafting of all bills, two bodies shall be set up: (1) a State Council, and (2) a State Assembly. 
 Bills may be introduced by any member of the State Council or by no fewer than twentymembers of the Assembly. 
 Bills are discussed and passed bythe Assembly, after which they go to the Council and final-ly to the tsar for his approval . 
 The tsar decides the form in which bills shall become law, or he vetoes them altogether. 
 Thus, the Bulygin “constitution” does not limit the auto-cratic regime at all but merely introduces two exclusivelyconsultative bodies: an Upper House and a Lower House!The Upper House, or State Council, is to consist of 60members elected by the Assemblies of the Nobles of 60gubernias (including the Polish gubernias), as well as of members appointed by the tsar from among the officials and *See p. 
 273 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 officers. 
 The total number of members is not to exceed 120. 
 The term of office of the elected members is three years. 
 The sessions of the Council may be open to the public or closed, at the discretion of the Council. 
 The Lower House, or State Assembly, is to consist of elective members only (Ministers and heads of departmentsmay sit ex officio in both Houses), namely: 10 representatives from each of the 34 Zemstvo gubernias (a total of 340); 8 representatives from each of the three gubernias having Zemstvo institutions but no institutions of the nobility(a total of 24); 8 from each of the nine North-Westerngubernias (72); 5 from each of the 10 Polish gubernias (50);5 from each of the three Baltic gubernias (15); 30 fromSiberia; 30 from the Caucasus; 15 from Central Asia and the Transcaspian region; 32 from Finland; 20 from the big cities (St. 
 Petersburg, 6; Moscow, 5; Warsaw, 3; Odessa,2; Lodz, Kiev, Riga, and Kharkov, 1 each); 10 from theGreek Orthodox clergy; 1 each from the Catholics, Luther-ans, Armenians, Mohammedans, and Jews. 
 That makes atotal of 643 members. 
 This Assembly is to elect an Executive Committee consisting of a chairman, two vice-chairmen, and 15 members. 
 Their term of office will be three years. 
 TheExecutive Committee is to be a permanent institution; theAssembly is to meet only twice a year: February-March andOctober-November. 
 The sessions may be open or closed atthe discretion of the Assembly. 
 During their term of office the members of the Assembly will enjoy personal immunity. 
 Only Russian subjects not under 25 years of age, with theability to read and write Russian, will be eligible. 
 They willreceive a salary of 3,000 rubles a year. 
 Elections shall be held as follows: in each of the 34 Zem-stvo gubernias, two members will be elected by the Assem-bly of the Nobles, three by the gubernia Zemstvo Assembly, one from the towns through special electors, three from thepeasants through special electors, and one from the merchants,also through electors. 
 The deputies from the non-Zemstvogubernias are to be elected on a similar basis; we shall notenumerate all these absurd bureaucratic and police insti-tutions. 
 To illustrate the proposed method of indirect elec-tion, we shall instance the procedure for the election ofpeasant representatives in the Zemstvo gubernias. 
 Every volost elects three electors. 
 These meet at the uyezd centre, the Marshal of the Nobility presiding (!), and choose three electors of the second degree. 
 These electors meet at the gubernia capital, the gubernia Marshal of the Nobilitypresiding, and elect the three representatives of the peasant-ry, who must themselves be peasants. 
 Thus the elections gothrough three stages! Mr. 
 Bulygin does not work at all badly. 
 He gets his salary from the tsar for services rendered. 
 His constitution, as the reader can see, is a downright travesty of popular repre-sentation. 
 The power of the autocracy, as we have shown,is not in the least restricted. 
 Both Houses are purely con-sultative, while the tsar alone has the power to decide. 
 Thewhole thing is simply a fine promise never meant to be kept. 
 In the first place, it is a “representation” specifically of the nobility , of the landlords . 
 The nobility has half the votes in the Upper House and close to half in the Lower (of theten representatives from each Zemstvo gubernia, two arefrom the nobility direct and three from the Zemstvo Assem-blies, which to all intents and purposes are assemblies of the nobility). 
 The participation of the peasants in the elections is ludicrously remote. 
 The three-stage system ofelections makes sure that the common people are thoroughlysifted out before they get to the Assembly. 
 In the second place, one is struck by the complete exclusion of the workers . 
 Representation in this sheep’s parliament is based entirely on the social-estate principle. 
 There is no workers’ “estate”, and there cannot be. 
 In thecase of the townsfolk and the merchants, the elections areso manipulated that only the industrial and commercial bour-geoisie filter through the various gradations of electors,and it is extremely illuminating to see how this bourgeoisie is pushed well into the background as compared with the nobility. 
 The tsar’s servants, it seems, do not much fearlandlord liberalism; they are shrewd enough to perceiveunder this veneer of liberalism the profoundly conservativesocial nature of “The Wild Gentleman”. 
 109 It would be serving a very useful purpose to make Bu-lygin’s constitution widely known among the workers and the peasants. 
 One could hardly show up more plainly thereal aspirations and the class basis of the tsarist power which /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR is supposed to stand above the classes. 
 One could hardly conceive of better material for object lessons in universal, direct, and equal suffrage by secret ballot. 
 It is interesting also to view this skimpy “constitution” of landlords and bureaucrats in the light of the latestreports on the Russian political parties. 
 Except for theextreme parties, the terrorists and the reactionaries, a certainEnglish correspondent (who evidently mixes in “society” and therefore does not see common people such as the workers) counts three parties: (1) the conservative, or pan-Slavic, party (the “Slavophil” system: to the tsar, the powerof authority; to his subjects, the power of opinion, viz. 
,a representative assembly with consultative powers only);(2) the liberal, or “opportunist”, party (its leader, Shipov; its programme—like that of all opportunists—“between two stools”); and (3) the radical, or (a very characteristic “or”!) constitutional party, which includes most of theZemstvo people, professors “and students” (?). 
 Its programme:universal suffrage by secret ballot. 
 The conservatives are said to be meeting now in St. 
 Pe-tersburg, the liberals will meet at the beginning of May in Moscow, and the radicals at the same time in St. 
 Petersburg. 
Government circles are said to regard universal suffrage bysecret ballot as equivalent to “ the proclamation of the republic ”. 
 The “radicals” are the most numerous of all the parties. 
 Bulygin’s project is, to all appearances, the project of the conservative party. 
 The project of the Osvobozhdeniye camp is very similar to the programme of the “radical orconstitutional” party (in reality, not at all radical and butpoorly constitutional). 
 Finally, the “liberal”, or Shipov,party probably wants a little more than is offered by Bulygin and a little less than is demanded by the constitutionalists. 
 The market-place is having a great day. 
 The bargaining is brisk. 
 The fine gentlemen of society are standing out fora high price and so are the cunning gentlemen of the Court. 
Everything points to the two of them knocking a bit offand then—striking a bargain, before the workers and peas-ants step in . 
 The government is playing a deep game. 
 It threatens the conservatives with the liberals; it threatens the liberals with the Osvobozhdeniye “radicals”; it threatens the last-named with the spectre of a republic. 
 Translated into the language of class interests, particularly of the chief inter-est—exploitation of the workers by the bourgeoisie—thisgame means: Let us come to terms, my dear landlordsand merchants; let us divide the power peaceably, in bondsof harmony, before it is too late, before the real popularrevolution sets in, before we have the rising of the whole proletariat and the whole peasantry, who will not swallow skimpy constitutions, indirect elections, or any otherbureaucratic rubbish. 
 The class-conscious proletariat must have no illusions. 
 The only pledge of Russia’s real emancipation from the entireserf-holding, absolutist system lies in it alone, in the prole-tariat supported by the peasantry, in the armed uprising of the two, in their desperate struggle under the slogan of“Death or freedom”. 
 Vperyod , No. 
 16, Published according to April 30 (17), 1905 the text in Vperyod Signed: K—v FORTNIGHTLY REPORTS OF THE PARTY ORGANISATIONS Fortnightly reports by all the Party organisations, es-pecially all the workers ’ Party organisations, would contrib-ute greatly towards consolidating the membership and theorganisational unity of the Party, particularly towards read-justing the Party’s representation (at congresses) in con-formity with the number of the organised workers. 
 The Central Organ of the Party could publish extracts from these reports which would serve as valuable material on theactual and genuine state of affairs in the Party. 
 The number of members in the study circles, groups, etc. 
, could also be published by using one or two lettersof the alphabet to denote this or that group or organisa-tion. 
 Such reports concerning the membership of our Party organisations would serve as useful material for control. 
(The objection that they would occupy too much spaceis groundless. 
 With two letters and two figures to showthe number of members—e. 
g. 
, ab 13, cd 41, ef 17, etc. 
—we would have eleven such reports to each line of column space. 
) The Congress should break up the interval between the Third and Fourth Congresses (one year) into two parts. 
 Dur-ing the first half, every Party organisation down to the lowest workers’ unit of our Party should constitute itselfand arrange without fail regular contact with the centre and the regular submission of fortnightly reports. 
 I say “arrange”, because it is not enough to take the address andwrite; it is necessary to check the addresses, to make sure that the reports are delivered, etc. 
, etc. 
 Four to five months * is quite sufficient for organising this new practice of fort-nightly reports with full regularity. 
 Without a doubt, given the will , this could be done in a third of the time. 
 After that, in the second half-year, the fortnightly reports of the Party organisations could be placed on a constitution-al basis, so to speak, i. 
e. 
, they would be used directly toreadjust the Party’s representation at the Fourth Congress. 
 Thus, let us say, the Third Congress decides in April 1905 that only Party organisations submitting the regular fort-nightly reports to the centre as of September 1, 1905, shallbe entitled to consideration in the readjusted Party repre-sentation for the Fourth Congress. 
 The Party’s representationat congresses pro rata to the number of workers organised in Social-Democratic leagues in each area will be deter-mined at the Fourth Congress only on the basis of thesereports for a period of not less than three months (a minimumof six reports). 
 The number of members, therefore, must begiven in each report. 
 Written at the end of April 1905 First published in 1926 Published according to in Lenin Miscellany V the manuscript *During this period every organisation should submit its cipher (two or three letters =name of the organisation) to the centre and achieve the publication of at least one of its reports in the Central Organ, sothat all the members of that organisation may conceive themselves of its connection with the centre.

, Geneva, 1905 Reduced 1 SPEECH ON THE VALIDITY OF THE CONGRESS APRIL 13 (26) I wish to reply to the remarks made here concerning the validity of the convocation of this Congress. 
 The Central Committee considered the Congress to be unauthorised. 
 TheC. 
C. 
 has characterised its own message to the Party Councilas “repentant”. 
 But was there anything for the C. 
C. 
 torepent? The Congress is perfectly valid. 
 It could, admitted-ly, be held invalid according to the letter of the Rules, but it would be grotesque formalism on our part to give the Rules such an interpretation. 
 According to the spirit of the Rules,the validity of the Congress is beyond question. 
 The PartyCouncil exists for the Party, and not the Party for the Coun-cil. 
 At the Second Congress, in connection with the Or-ganising Committee incident, it was pointed out, by none other than Comrade Plekhanov, that discipline with regard to a lower body yields precedence to discipline with regardto a higher body. 
 The C. 
C. 
 declared its readiness to submitto the Party Council, if the latter would submit to the Party,viz. 
, to the Congress. 
 This was a perfectly legitimate demand,yet the Party Council rejected it. 
 But the C. 
C. 
, we are told, began to doubt the loyalty of the Party Council and expressed its lack of confidence in it. 
 However, as we know,in all constitutionally governed countries the citizens have aright to express their lack of confidence in any public ser-vant or institution. 
 This is their inalienable right. 
 Finally,even if the C. 
C. 
 acted unwarrantedly, did that give the Party Council the right also to act unwarrantedly? What guaran-tee is there that the clause in the Rules which puts the PartyCouncil under obligation to call a congress upon its endorse-ment by half the qualified votes will actually be enforced? The Rules of the German Social-Democratic Party contain a clause authorising the Control Commission to convene a congress, if the Vorstand * refuses to do so. 
 We have no such provision, and it rests entirely with the Party to ensurethat the Congress is convened. 
 From the spirit of the Rules,and even from their letter, if taken as a whole, it is clearthat the Party Council is the agent of the Party committees. 
 The agent of the committees refuses to do the bidding of its principals. 
 If the agent does not carry out the will of theParty, the only thing left for the Party is to execute itswill itself. 
 The Party committees not only had the rightto call the Congress themselves, but were in duty boundto do so. 
 I maintain that the Congress was convened in a perfectly legitimate way. 
 Who is the judge in this dis-pute between the Party Council and the committees? Why,these very committees, the Party. 
 The will of the Party wasexpressed long ago. 
 All the delay and procrastination onthe part of the centres abroad could not alter it. 
 The commit-tees were obligated to convene the Congress themselves, and the Congress has been convened lawfully. 
 Now, to meet Comrade Tigrov’s point. 
 Comrade Tigrov says we ought not to judge the Party Council. 
 But the wholereport of the Organising Committee is a judgement of theParty Council. 
 I think Comrade Tigrov errs in holding thatwe must not judge the accused in absentia . 
 In politics one is constantly compelled to judge in absentia . 
 Do we not con-stantly judge the Socialists-Revolutionaries, the Bundists,and others in our writings, at our meetings, and everywhere?What else can we do but judge in absentia , if the Party Council refuses to appear at the Congress? In that case wecould never judge anyone. 
 Even the official court judges in absentia if the accused refuses to appear before it.

 2 SPEECH ON THE QUALIFIEDNESS OF THE KAZAN AND KUBAN COMMITTEES APRIL 14 (27) The findings of the Credentials Committee show that the Party is represented by a total number of 75 votes, so that our Congress, as now constituted, must beyond a doubtbe recognised as valid. 
 Considering the present attitude ofsuspicion towards the Congress, we must recognise as com-mendable the “liberal” tendency of the Credentials Commit-tee to confirm the largest possible number of committees in order to increase the lawful majority necessary for the Congress. 
 From this angle I am even ready to express mysympathy with such “liberality”. 
 But, on the other hand,one must be equally careful and impartial towards all, andfor that reason I feel constrained to oppose the CredentialsCommittee’s confirmation of the Kazan and Kuban commit-tees. 
 They are included in the list of qualified committees published in issue No. 
 89 of Iskra , but not in the list recorded in the minutes of the Party Council. 
 At the Council sessionComrade Martov read the list of qualified committees validuntil September 1, 1904. 
 (An excerpt from the minutes of the Party Council fol-lows ): “Martov reads his resolution: According to Clause 2 of the Rules the Party Council is obligated to convene a congress when this is de-manded by Party organisations commanding aggregately at least half the total voting strength of the congress. 
 According to Note 1 to Clause 3, only organisations duly confirmed after the adoption of the PartyRules shall be entitled to representation at a congress. 
 “Organisations not represented at the Second Congress are to be con-sidered confirmed, if their confirmation by the C. 
C. 
 was accorded not later than one year prior to the Congress. 
 (I) The Party Council resolves that any organisation which shall have been confirmed within thespecified period of time shall be entitled to have its vote counted at thecomputation of the number of organisations that have gone on record in favour of convening the Congress. 
 The organisations represented at the Second Congress and elected by it shall be considered qualifiedorganisations. 
 (II) In view of this, only the following organisationsshall hereafter and until September 1904 be entitled to vote on thequestion of convening a congress: (1) the C. 
C. 
; (2) the Central Organ;(3) the League Abroad; (4-20) the committees of St. 
 Petersburg, Mos-cow, Kharkov, Kiev, Odessa, Nikolayev, of the Don region, of Ekate-rinoslav Saratov, Ufa (now the Ural region), of the North, of Tula,Tver, Nizhni-Novgorod, Baku, Batum, and Tiflis (until the expirationof one year from the time of the confirmation of the CaucasianLeague); (21-23) the League of the Mining and Metal District (Donets),and the Siberian and the Crimean leagues. 
 “The qualifiedness of these organisations assumed, the number of votes they are entitled to cast at the Congress is 46. 
 With the 5 votes ofthe Party Council members, the total voting strength of the Congressis 51; therefore, to convene a congress 26 votes are required, viz. 
, thevotes of 13 of the above-named qualified organisations. 
 The C. 
C. 
 isrequested to furnish the Party Council with the dates of its confirmation of the new committees since the Congress. 
” The first part of the resolution was adopted unanimously. 
 Later in his speech at that meeting, Comrade Glebov read out a list of the newly-formed committees. 
 Comrade Glebov ’s speech (from the minutes of the Party Council ): “I agree with Comrade Martov and would like to state that the fol-lowing new committees have been organised: Smolensk and Astrakhan, confirmed in September 1903; Voronezh (the Fund for the Struggle), in January 1904; Riga, in January, Polesye, in April, North-Western,in April; Kursk, in January; Orel-Bryansk, in September 1903;Samara, in September 1903; Ural (Ufa), in April. 
” These facts were made public in Comrade Orlovsky’s pamphlet The Council Against the Party , and so far the Council has neither refuted them nor published the dates of the confirmation of the committees under dispute, whichwould seem to indicate that there is no evidence of suchconfirmation. 
 At the stated meeting of the Party Council,Comrade Martov declared in one of his speeches that in hisopinion two more committees were to be confirmed in August, namely, the Kremenchug and Poltava committees—but again not a word about the Kazan and Kuban committees. 
 After the July declaration, Comrade Glebov sent me the full minutes of the C. 
C. 
 meetings, in which no reference is made to the confirmation of either the Kazan or the Kuban Committee; at subsequent C. 
C. 
 meetings, as Comrade Let-nev, 111 a member of the C. 
C. 
, has testified, there was like-wise no mention of their confirmation. 
 True, ComradeZimin, 112 a member of the C. 
C. 
, has a hazy recollection of the Kazan and Kuban committees having been confirmed, but he can state nothing definite. 
 The Credentials Committee’s decision to recognise these committees as qualified on the evidence of their having func-tioned for over a year, is not correct, and I move, therefore,that these committees be declared non-qualified. 
 3 DRAFT RESOLUTION ON THE ATTITUDE OF THE R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 TOWARDS THE ARMED UPRISING 1. 
 Whereas the proletariat, being, by virtue of its posi-tion, the foremost and most consistent revolutionary class,is therefore called upon to play the role of leader and guideof the general democratic revolutionary movement in Russia; 2. 
 Whereas only the performance of this role during the revolution will ensure the proletariat the most advantageousposition in the ensuing struggle for socialism against thepropertied classes of the bourgeois-democratic Russia aboutto be born; and 3. 
 Whereas the proletariat can perform this role only if it is organised under the banner of Social-Democracy into an independent political force and if it acts in strikesand demonstrations with the fullest possible unity;— Therefore, the Third Congress of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 resolves that the task of organising the forces of the proletariat fordirect struggle against the autocracy by means of mass po-litical strikes and the armed uprising, and of setting up for this purpose an apparatus for information and leadership,is one of the chief tasks of the Party at the present revolu-tionary moment; for which reason the Congress instructsboth the C. 
C. 
 and the local committees and leagues to startpreparing the political mass strike as well as the organi-sation of special groups for the obtainment and distribu-tion of arms, for the elaboration of a plan of the armed up-rising and the direct leadership of the rising. 
 The fulfilmentof this task can and should proceed in such a way as will notonly not in the least prejudice the general work of awaken-ing the class-consciousness of the proletariat, but, on the contrary, will render that work more effective and successful. 
 Written on April 14 (27), 1905 4 DRAFT RESOLUTION ON THE ARMED UPRISING The Congress holds, on the basis of the practical experi-ences of the functionaries and on the basis of the mood of theworking-class masses, that preparations for the uprisingimply, not only the preparation of weapons, the formation of groups, etc. 
, but also the accumulation of experience by means of practical attempts at separate armed actions,such as attacks by armed squads on the police and on troopsduring public meetings, or on prisons, government offices,etc. 
 While fully relying on the local Party centres and onthe C. 
C. 
 to determine the limits of such actions and the most convenient occasions for them, while fully relying on the comrades’ discretion in avoiding a useless expenditure ofeffort on petty acts of terror, the Congress draws the atten-tion of all Party organisations to the need for taking intoconsideration the above-mentioned facts of experience. 
 Written at the end of April 1905 First published in 1931 Published according to in Lenin Miscellany XVI the manuscript 5 SPEECH ON THE QUESTION OF THE ARMED UPRISING APRIL 15 (28) It has been said here that the question is clear enough in principle. 
 Nevertheless, statements have been made in Social-Democratic literature (see Iskra , No. 
 62, and Com-rade Axelrod’s foreword to the pamphlet by “A Worker”)which go to show that the question is not so clear after all. 
Iskra and Axelrod talked about conspiracy and expressed the fear that too much thought would be given to the up-rising. 
 The facts show, however, that there has been too little thought on the subject.... 
 In his foreword to the pamphletby “A Worker”, Comrade Axelrod maintains that it can onlybe a question of an uprising of the “uncivilised masses”. 
Events have shown that we are dealing, not with anuprising of the “uncivilised masses”, but with an uprising of politically conscious masses capable of carrying on an organ-ised struggle. 
 The entire history of the past year proved thatwe underestimated the significance and the inevitability ofthe uprising. 
 Attention must be paid to the practical aspectof the matter. 
 In this respect the experience of those engagedin practical work and of the workers of St. 
 Petersburg, Riga, and the Caucasus is of exceptional importance. 
 I would suggest, therefore, that the comrades tell us of their experi-ence; that will make our discussion practical instead of aca-demic. 
 We must ascertain the mood of the proletariat—whether the workers consider themselves fit to struggle andto lead the struggle. 
 We must sum up this collective exper-ience, from which no generalised conclusions have as yet been drawn. 
 6 SPEECH ON THE QUESTION OF THE ARMED UPRISING APRIL 16 (29) During the debate the question was put on a practical plane: what is the mood of the masses? Comrade Leskov113 was right in saying that it was chequered. 
 But Comrade Zharkov is right, too, in saying that we must reckon withthe fact that the uprising, whatever we may think of it, isbound to take place. 
 The question arises whether there areany differences in principle between the resolutions sub-mitted. 
 I fail totally to see any. 
 Although I am viewed as an arch-intransigent, I will, nevertheless, try to reconcileand bring these two resolutions into line—I will undertaketheir reconciliation. 
 I have nothing against the amendmentto Comrade Voinov’s resolution. 
 Nor do I see any differencein principle in the addendum. 
 Very energetic participation does not necessarily imply hegemony. 
 I think Comrade Mikhailov expressed himself in a more positive manner; heemphasises hegemony, and in a concrete form, too. 
 TheEnglish proletariat is destined to bring about a socialistrevolution—that is beyond doubt; but its inability tobring it about at the present moment, owing to its lack of socialist organisation and its corruption by the bourgeoisie, is equally beyond dispute. 
 Comrade Voinov expresses thesame thought: the most energetic participation is undoubted-ly the most decisive participation. 
 Whether the proletariatwill decide the outcome of the revolution—no one can assertabsolutely. 
 This is likewise true of the role of leader. 
 Com-rade Voinov’s resolution is worded more carefully. 
 Social-Democracy may organise the uprising, it may even be thedeciding factor in it. 
 But whether Social-Democracy will have the leading role in it cannot be predetermined; that will depend on the strength and organisation of the prole-tariat. 
 The petty bourgeoisie may be better organised and its diplomats may prove to be superior and better trained. 
Comrade Voinov is the more cautious; he says, “You maybe able to do it. 
” “You will do it,” says Comrade Mikhailov. 
The proletariat may possibly decide the outcome of the rev-olution, but this cannot be asserted positively. 
 Comrades Mikhailov and Sosnovsky are guilty of the very error they charge Comrade Voinov with: “Count not your trophiesbefore the battle. 
” “For guarantee, it is necessary,” says Voinov; “necessary and sufficient,” say Mikhailov and Sosnovsky. 
 As to organ-ising special fighting groups, I might say that I consider them necessary. 
 We need not fear to form them. 
 7 RESOLUTION ON THE ARMED UPRISING114 1. 
 Whereas the proletariat being, by virtue of its posi-tion, the foremost and only consistently revolutionary class, is therefore called upon to play the leading role in the general democratic revolutionary movement in Russia; 2. 
 Whereas this movement at the present time has already led to the necessity of an armed uprising; 3. 
 Whereas the proletariat will inevitably take the most energetic part in this uprising, which participation will decide the destiny of the revolution in Russia; 4. 
 Whereas the proletariat can play the leading role in this revolution only if it is united in a single and inde-pendent political force under the banner of the Social-Democratic Labour Party, which directs its struggle bothideologically and practically; and 5. 
 Whereas only the performance of this role will ensure to the proletariat the most advantageous conditions for thestruggle for socialism against the propertied classes ofbourgeois-democratic Russia;— Therefore, the Third Congress of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 holds that the task of organising the proletariat for direct struggle against the autocracy by means of the armed uprising is one of the major and most urgent tasks of the Party at the presentrevolutionary moment. 
 Accordingly, the Congress instructs all Party organisa-tions: a) to explain to the proletariat by means of propaganda and agitation, not only the political significance, but the practical organisational aspect of the impending armed up-rising, b) to explain in that propaganda and agitation the role of mass political strikes, which may be of great importance at the beginning and during the progress of the uprising, and c) to take the most energetic steps towards arming the proletariat, as well as drawing up a plan of the armed up-rising and of direct leadership thereof, for which purposespecial groups of Party workers should be formed as and whennecessary. 
 Written on April 1 6 (29), 1905 Published according to the manuscript 8 SPEECH ON THE ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE GOVERNMENT’S TACTICS ON THE EVE OF THE REVOLUTION APRIL 18 (MAY 1) We are in a quandary. 
 We have three resolutions and three amendments. 
 The resolutions are growing in number andscope, and this process is not being regulated in any way. 
The subject has proved to be broader than the speaker whomade the report anticipated. 
 We shall have to refer theresolution back to the committee, although Comrade Serge-yev 115 evidently ridicules this proposal. 
 The question of open action was touched upon by all the speakers. 
 Thereport was appropriate to the subject, but needs amplifying. 
On the question of participation in the societies opinion isdivided. 
 The Congress cannot lay down a hard and fast ruleon this point. 
 All methods should be used for agitation. 
 The experience of the Shidlovsky Commission gives no grounds whatever for a downright negative attitude. 
 Some say thatthere is nothing new in the resolution. 
 A good thing bearsrepeating again and again. 
 Comrade Zimin’s view is toorigid. 
 It is impossible to reply categorically whether it isadvisable to participate in the Zemsky Sobor. 
 Everything will depend on the political situation, on the electoral sys-tem, and on other specific factors which cannot be estimatedin advance. 
 Some say that the Zemsky Sobor is a fraud. 
That is true. 
 But there are times when we must take partin elections to expose a fraud. 
 We can give nothing morethan a general directive. 
 I repeat, in my opinion all the resolutions should he referred back to the committee, the membership of which should be enlarged. 
 9 ADDENDUM TO THE RESOLUTION ON THE ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE GOVERNMENT’S POLICY ON THE EVE AND AT THE MOMENT OF THE REVOLUTION Could we not satisfy Comrade Alexandrov116 with the following amendments to Schmidt’s117 resolution (roughly): 1) instead of (the Congress) “resolves”: the Congress confirms the old tactics of the Social-Democrats as laid down at the Second Congress, with a detailed explanation appli-cable to the present moment (or something of the kind); 2) to add another clause to the resolution approximately as follows: As regards the actual and sham concessions which the weak-ened autocracy is now making to the democrats in generaland to the working class in particular, the Social-Democrat-ic party of the working class should take advantage of them in order, on the one hand, to consolidate for the people every improvement in the economic conditions and every exten-sion of liberties with a view to intensifying the struggle, andon the other, steadily to expose before the proletariat thereactionary aims of the government, which is trying to dis-unite and corrupt the working class and draw its atten-tion away from its urgent class needs at the moment of the revolution.

 calls the attention of all Party organisations to the fact that itis necessary a) to make use of each and every case of open political action on the part of the educated spheres and the people,whether in the press, in associations, or at meetings, forthe purpose of contraposing the independent class demandsof the proletariat to the general democratic demands, so asto develop its class-consciousness and to organise it in the course of such actions into an independent socialist force; b) to make use of all legal and semi-legal channels for creating workers’ societies, associations, and organisations, and to put forward every effort towards securing (in what-ever way) the predominance of Social-Democratic influence in such associations and to convert them into bases for the future openly functioning Social-Democratic working-classparty in Russia; c) to take the necessary steps to ensure that our Party organisations, while maintaining and developing their un-derground machinery, will proceed at once to the preparation of expedient forms of transition, wherever and whenever possible, to open Social-Democratic activity, even to thepoint of clashes with the armed forces of the government. 
 Written on April 19 (May 2), 1905 First published in 1926 Published according to in Lenin Miscellany V the manuscript 11 DRAFT RESOLUTION ON THE PARTICIPATION OF THE SOCIAL-DEMOCRATS IN A PROVISIONAL REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENT 1. 
 Whereas a really free and open mass struggle of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie requires the widest pos-sible political liberty and, consequently, the fullest possiblerealisation of republican forms of government; 2. 
 Whereas various bourgeois and petty-bourgeois sec-tions of the population, the peasantry, etc. 
, are now coming out in increasing numbers with revolutionary-democratic slogans, which are the natural and inevitable expression ofthe basic needs of the masses, the satisfaction of which—impossible under the autocracy—has been made imperativeby the objective development of the entire socio-economiclife of Russia; 3. 
 Whereas international revolutionary Social-Democracy has always recognised that the proletariat must rendermost energetic support to the revolutionary bourgeoisie inits struggle against all reactionary classes and institutions,provided that the party of the proletariat maintain abso-lute independence and a strictly critical attitude towards its temporary allies; 4. 
 Whereas the overthrow of the autocratic government in Russia is inconceivable without its replacement by aprovisional revolutionary government, and whereas onlysuch a change can ensure real freedom and a true expressionof the will of the whole people during the inauguration of the new political system in Russia and guarantee the reali-sation of our programme of immediate and direct politicaland economic changes; 5. 
 Whereas without the replacement of the autocratic government by a provisional revolutionary government sup-ported by all revolutionary-democratic classes and class elements in Russia, it will be impossible to achieve a repub-lican form of government and win over to the revolutionthe backward and undeveloped sections of the proletariatand particularly of the peasantry—those sections whoseinterests are completely opposed to the absolutist, serf-holding order and which cling to the autocracy or stand apart from the struggle against it largely on account of the oppres-sive stupefying atmosphere; and 6. 
 Whereas with the existence in Russia of a Social-Demo-cratic party of the working class, which, though only in theinitial stage of its development, is nevertheless already organised and capable, particularly under conditions of political freedom, of controlling and directing the actions ofits delegates in a provisional revolutionary government,the danger that these delegates may deviate from the correctclass line is not insurmountable;— Therefore, the Third Congress of the R.

 holds that representatives of the Party may participate in the provisional revolutionary government for the purpose ofrelentlessly combating, together with the revolutionarybourgeois democrats, all attempts at counter-revolution, and ofdefending the independent class interests of the proletariat,provided that the Party maintain strict control over its representatives and firmly safeguard the independence of the Social-Democratic Labour Party, which aims at thecomplete socialist revolution and is in this respect hostileto all bourgeois-democratic parties and classes.

 It may seem strange, at first glance, that such aquestion should have arisen. 
 One might think the cause ofSocial-Democracy to be thriving and the probability ofits participation in a provisional revolutionary government to be very great. 
 Actually it is not so. 
 To debate this ques-tion as an immediately realisable prospect would be quixotic. 
But the question has been forced upon us not so much by theactual state of affairs as by literary polemics. 
 It must alwaysbe borne in mind that the question was first raised by Mar-tynov, and that he raised it before January 9 . 
 He wrote in his pamphlet Two Dictatorships (pp. 
 10-11): “Imagine, dear reader, for a moment, that Lenin’s utopia has been realised; imagine that the Party, whose membership has been narroweddown to only professional revolutionaries, has succeeded in ‘preparing,timing , and carrying out the general armed uprising of the people’. 
 Is it not obvious that it would be this Party which would be designated as the provisional government by the will of the whole people immedia-tely after the revolution? Is it not obvious that the people would placethe immediate fate of the revolution in the hands of this Party, and noother? Is it not obvious that this Party, not wishing to betray the con-fidence previously placed in it by the people, would be forced, be in duty bound , to assume power and maintain it until it had consolidated the victory of the revolution by revolutionary measures?” Incredible as it may seem, this is actually how the ques-tion is presented: Martynov believes that if we were thor-oughly to prepare and launch the uprising, we should find ourselves in a desperate predicament. 
 If we were to submit our dispute to a foreigner, he would never believe it possible for the question to be formulated in that manner and hewould not understand us. 
 Our dispute cannot be understoodwithout a knowledge of the history of Russian Social-Demo-cratic views and the nature of the tail-endist views ofRabocheye Dyelo . 
 This question has become an urgent question of theory and must be clarified. 
 It is a question of clarity in our aims. 
 I urge the comrades when reporting on our discus-sion to the members engaged in practical Party work in Russiato emphasise strongly Martynov’s formulation of the question. 
 Iskra , No. 
 96, contains an article by Plekhanov. 
 We have always held Plekhanov in great esteem for the “of-fence” he has repeatedly given to the opportunists, which, to his honour, has earned him a mass of enemies. 
 But we cannotesteem him for defending Martynov. 
 This is not the Plekhanovwe knew. 
 He entitles his article “On the Question of theSeizure of Power”. 
 This artificially narrows the issue. 
 Wehave never thus presented the question. 
 Plekhanov presents things as though Vperyod called Marx and Engels “virtuosi of philistinism”. 
 But that is not so; it is a slight substitu-tion. 
 Vperyod expressly stressed the correctness of Marx’s general conception of this question. 
 The charge of philistin-ism referred to Martynov or to L. 
 Martov. 
 Well disposedthough we are to hold in high esteem all who collaborate with Plekhanov, it must be said, however, that Martynov is not Marx. 
 Plekhanov errs in seeking to hush up Martynovism. 
 Martynov asserts that if we take a decisive part in the uprising, we shall be in great danger of being forced bythe proletariat to take power. 
 This argument has a certainoriginal logic of its own, although a logic of retreat. 
 It is in reference to this peculiar warning against the danger of vic-tory in the struggle against the autocracy that Vperyod asks Martynov and L. 
 Martov what they are talking about: asocialist or a democratic dictatorship? We are referredto Engels’ famous words about the danger involved in theposition of a leader who has been given power in behalf of a class that is not yet mature for the exercise of complete domination. 
 We explained in Vperyod that Engels points out the danger to the position of a leader when he establishes post factum a divergence between principle and reality, between words and facts. 
 Such a divergence leads to disaster in the sense of political failure, not in the sense of physical defeat *; you must affirm (this is Engels’ thought) that the revolution is socialistic, when it is really only democratic. 
If we promised the Russian proletariat now that we couldsecure its complete domination immediately, we would fallinto the error of the Socialists-Revolutionaries. 
 It is this mistake of the Socialists-Revolutionaries that we Social-Democrats have always ridiculed—their claim that therevolution will be “democratic and not bourgeois”. 
 Wehave constantly said that the revolution would strengthen thebourgeoisie, not weaken it, but that it would create for theproletariat the necessary conditions for waging a success-ful struggle for socialism. 
 But since it is a question of a democratic revolution, we are faced with two forces: the autocracy and the revolu-tionary people, viz. 
, the proletariat as the chief combatant,and the peasantry and all the different petty-bourgeoiselements. 
 The interests of the proletariat do not coincide with those of the peasantry and the petty bourgeoisie. 
 So-cial-Democracy has always stressed the fact that these classdifferences in the midst of a revolutionary people are unavoid-able. 
 In a hard-fought struggle, the object of the strugglemay change from hand to hand. 
 A revolutionary peoplestrives for the sovereignty of the people; all the reactionary elements defend the sovereignty of the tsar. 
 A successful revolution, therefore, cannot be anything but the democraticdictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry, whoseinterests, equally opposed to the sovereignty of the tsar , coincide. 
 Both Iskra and Vperyod are agreed on the slogan “To march separately but strike together”, but Vperyod adds that striking jointly means jointly striking the final blow and jointly beating off the enemy’s attempts to recoverthe ground he has lost. 
 After the overthrow of the autocracy,the struggle will not cease, but become more intense. 
That is precisely the time when the reactionary forces willorganise for the struggle in real earnest. 
 If we are going to employ the slogan of the uprising, we must not frighten the *See pp. 
 279-80 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 Social-Democrats with the possibility of victory in the up-rising. 
 When we have won the sovereignty of the people, we shall have to consolidate it—this is what is meant by the revolutionary-democratic dictatorship. 
 We have no reasonwhatever to fear it. 
 The establishment of the republic wouldbe a tremendous victory for the proletariat, although, unlikethe bourgeois revolutionary, the Social-Democrat does notregard the republic as the “absolute ideal” but merely as something that will guarantee him freedom to wage the struggle for socialism on a broad basis. 
 Parvus says that inno other country has the struggle for freedom entailed suchtremendous sacrifices. 
 This is true. 
 It is confirmed by the Euro-pean bourgeois press, which is following events in Russiavery closely from the outside. 
 The autocracy’s resistance to the most elementary reforms is incredibly strong, and the greater the action the greater the counter-action. 
 Hence theautocracy’s utter collapse is highly probable. 
 The entirequestion of the revolutionary-democratic dictatorshiphinges on the complete overthrow of the autocracy. 
 Possiblythe history of 1848-50 will repeat itself with us, that is, the autocracy will not be overthrown but only limited in power and converted into a constitutional monarchy. 
 In thatcase a democratic dictatorship will be out of the question. 
If, however, the autocratic government is really over-thrown, it will have to be replaced by another. 
 This other canbe only a provisional revolutionary government. 
 It can base itself for support only on the revolutionary people—on the proletariat and the peasantry. 
 It can be only a dictatorship,that is, not an organisation of “order”, but an organisationof war. 
 If you are storming a fortress, you cannot discontinuethe war even after you have taken the fortress. 
 Either the oneor the other: either we take the fortress to hold it, or we do not storm the fortress and explain that all we want is a little place next to it. 
 Let me pass on to Plekhanov. 
 His method is totally incorrect. 
 He evades important questions of principle toindulge in quibbling, with an element of misstatement. 
(Exclamation by Comrade Barsov : “Hear, hear!”) Vperyod maintains that Marx’s general scheme is correct (that of replacing the autocracy first by a bourgeois monarchy and thenby a petty-bourgeois democratic republic); but if we set out /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR beforehand to restrict the limits to which we shall go in ac-cordance with this scheme, we shall prove ourselves philistines. 
 Thus, Plekhanov’s defence of Marx is verlorene Liebesmühe (love’s labour’s lost). 
 In defending Martynov, Plekhanovrefers to the Address 118 of the Central Committee of the Communist League119 to the League membership. 
 Plekhanov misstates this Address too. 
 He draws a veil over the fact thatit was written at a time when the people had failed to score a complete victory, notwithstanding the victorious uprising of the Berlin proletariat in 1848. 
 Absolutism had beensuperseded by a bourgeois constitutional monarchy, and,consequently, a provisional government backed by the entirerevolutionary people was out of the question. 
 The wholepoint of the Address is that after the failure of the popular uprising Marx advises the working class to organise and prepare. 
 Can these counsels serve to clarify the situation inRussia before the uprising has begun? Can they resolvethe moot question which presupposes the victorious uprisingof the proletariat? The Address begins thus: “In the tworevolutionary years 1848-49 the League proved itself in double fashion: first, in that its members energetically took part in the movement in all places.... 
 The League furtherproved itself in that its conception of the movement [as setforth, by the way, in the Communist Manifesto ] turned out to be the only correct one.... 
 At the same time, the formerfirm organisation of the League was considerably slackened. 
 A large part of the members who directly participated in the revolutionary movement believed the time for secret soci-eties to have gone by and public activities alone sufficient. 
The individual circles and communities allowed theirconnections with the Central Committee ( Zentralbehörde ) to become loose and gradually dormant. 
 Consequently , while the democratic party , the party of the petty bourgeoisie , organised itself more and more in Germany , the workers ’ party lost its only firm hold , remained organised at the most in sep-arate localities for local purposes and in the general move-ment (in der allgemeinen Bewegung ) thus came completely under the domination and leadership of the petty-bourgeois democrats ” (Ansprache , p. 
 75). 
 Thus, Marx found in 1850 that the petty-bourgeois demo-crats had gained in organisation during the Revolution of 1848, which had run its course, while the workers’ party had lost. 
 Naturally, Marx’s chief concern was that the work-ers’ party should not lag behind the bourgeoisie a second time. 
 It is “extremely important that ... precisely at thismoment, when a new revolution is impending, the workers’party must act in the most organised, most unanimous andmost independent fashion possible, if it is not to be exploitedand taken in tow again by the bourgeoisie as in 1848” ( An-sprache , p. 
 76). 
 It is because the bourgeois democrats were better organ-ised that Marx did not doubt that they would definitely pre-dominate, should a second revolution take place at once. 
“That, during the further development of the revolution,the petty-bourgeois democracy will for a moment ( für einen Augenblick ) obtain predominating influence in Germany is not open to doubt” ( Ansprache , p. 
 78). 
 Taking all this into consideration, we can understand why Marx does notmention a word in Ansprache about the participation of the proletariat in a provisional revolutionary government. 
Plekhanov, therefore, is entirely incorrect in asserting that Marx “considered inadmissible the thought that the political representatives of the proletariat could work together withthe representatives of the petty bourgeoisie for the creationof a new social order” ( Iskra , No. 
 96). 
 This is not correct. 
 Marx does not raise the question of participation in a provi-sional revolutionary government, whereas Plekhanov makes it appear as though Marx decided this question in the nega-tive. 
 Marx says: We Social-Democrats have all been lagging behind, we are worse organised, we must organise independ-ently for the eventuality that the petty bourgeoisie willcome to power after a new revolution. 
 From these premisesof Marx, Martynov draws the following conclusion: We Social-Democrats, now better organised than the petty-bourgeois democrats and constituting undoubtedly anindependent party, ought to shrink from having to participate in a provisional revolutionary government in the event of asuccessful uprising. 
 Yes! Comrade Plekhanov, Marxism isone thing and Martynovism another. 
 To bring out more clearly the great difference between the situation in Russia in 1905 and that in Germany in 1850, let us deal with somefurther interesting passages in the Address. 
 Marx did not even mention the democratic dictatorship of the proletariat, for he believed in the direct socialist dictatorship of the proletariat immediately after the petty-bourgeois revolu-tion. 
 On the agrarian question, for instance, he says thatthe democrats want to create a petty-bourgeois peasant class,but that the workers must oppose this plan in the interestsof the rural proletariat and in their own interests; they mustdemand that the confiscated feudal landed property remain state property, and that it be used for labour colonies in which the associated rural proletariat should employ allthe means of large-scale agriculture. 
 Obviously, with suchplans in mind, Marx could not speak of a democratic dicta-torship. 
 He wrote, not on the eve of the revolution, as therepresentative of the organised proletariat, but after the revolution, as the representative of the workers in the process of organising. 
 Marx emphasises the first task asfollows: “After the overthrow of the existing governments,the Central Committee will, as soon as it is at all possible,betake itself to Germany, immediately convene a congress,and put before the latter the necessary proposals for the centralisation of the workers’ clubs.... 
” Thus, the idea of an independent workers’ party, which has become with us boneof our bone and flesh of our flesh, was then something new. 
We must not forget that in 1848, when Marx was editing thefree and extremely revolutionary newspaper ( Die Neue Rheinische Zeitung 120), he had no working-class organi-sation behind him. 
 His paper was supported by bourgeois radicals, who nearly wrecked it when Marx made his scath-ing attack on the Paris bourgeoisie after the June Days. 
That is why the Address has so much to say about the inde-pendent organisation of the workers. 
 It deals with the for-mation of revolutionary workers’ governments parallel with the new official government, whether in the form of workers’ clubs and committees or of local communal councils andmunicipalities. 
 The point made therein is that the workersshould be armed and that they should form an independentworkers’ guard. 
 The second clause in the programme statesthat working-class candidates, preferably members of the League, should be nominated for these bodies alongside the bourgeois candidates. 
 How weak the League was is shownby the fact that Marx had to argue the need for nominating independent candidates. 
 The inference to be drawn from all this is that Marx did not mention and had no intention of deciding the question of participation in a provisional rev-olutionary government, since that question could have nopractical significance at the time; the entire attention wasconcentrated exclusively on the organisation of an independ-ent workers’ party. 
 Plekhanov says further in Iskra that Vperyod produces no relevant evidence, but confines itself to repeating a few favourite catchwords, and he alleges that Vperyod seeks to criticise Marx. 
 With what truth? Do we not see, on thecontrary, that Vperyod puts the question on a concrete basis, taking into account the real social forces engaged in Russiain the struggle for the democratic revolution? Plekhanov, on the other hand, does not say a word about the concrete conditions in Russia. 
 His stock-in-trade consists of a coupleof inapposite quotations. 
 Monstrous, but true. 
 The situationin Russia differs so greatly from that in Western Europethat even Parvus was prompted to ask: Where is our revolu-tionary democracy? Unable to prove that Vperyod wants to “criticise” Marx, Plekhanov drags in Mach and Avena-rius by the ears. 
 I cannot for the life of me understand whatthese writers, for whom I have not the slightest sympathy,have to do with the question of social revolution. 
 They wroteon individual and social organisation of experience, or somesuch theme, but they never really gave any thought to the democratic dictatorship. 
 Does Plekhanov mean to say that Parvus, perhaps, has become a disciple of Mach and Avena-rius? ( Laughter . 
) Or perhaps things have come to such a pass with Plekhanov that he has to make a butt of Mach andAvenarius without rhyme or reason. 
 Plekhanov goes on tosay that Marx and Engels soon lost faith in an imminent social revolution. 
 The Communist League broke up. 
 Petty squabbles arose among the political emigrants abroad,which Marx and Engels put down to the fact that while therewere revolutionaries there was no revolution. 
 Plekhanovwrites in Iskra : “They [Marx and Engels, who had lost faith in an imminent social revolution] would have formulated the political tasks of the proletariat on the assumption that the democratic system would be predominant for a fairlylong time. 
 But for this very reason they would have been more emphatic than ever in condemning the socialists’ par-ticipation in a petty-bourgeois government” ( Iskra , No. 
 96). 
 Why? No answer. 
 Once more Plekhanov uses democratic dictatorship interchangeably with socialist dictatorship,i. 
e. 
, he falls into Martynov’s error, against which Vperyod has time and again strongly warned. 
 Without the democraticdictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry norepublic is possible in Russia. 
 This assertion was made by Vperyod on the basis of an analysis of the actual situation. 
 Unfortunately, Marx did not know this situation and he didnot write of it. 
 Therefore the analysis of this situation canneither be confirmed nor refuted with simple quotationsfrom Marx. 
 As to the concrete conditions, Plekhanov saysnot a word. 
 Even less felicitous is the adducing of the second quotation from Engels. 
 For one thing, it is rather odd of Plekhanovto refer to a private letter without mention of the time andplace of its publication. 
 121 We could only be grateful for the publication of Engels’ letters, but we should like to seetheir full text. 
 We have, however, some information which permits us to judge of the true meaning of Engels’ letter. 
 We know definitely, in the second place, that the situa-tion in Italy in the nineties was nothing like the presentsituation in Russia. 
 Italy had been enjoying freedom forforty years. 
 In Russia the working class cannot even dreamof such freedom without a bourgeois revolution. 
 In Italy, consequently, the working class had long been in a position to develop an independent organisation for the socialistrevolution. 
 Turati is the Italian Millerand. 
 It is quite pos-sible, therefore, that even at that time Turati advocatedMillerandian ideas. 
 This assumption is borne out by thefact that, according to Plekhanov himself, Engels had to explain to Turati the difference between a bourgeois-demo-cratic and a socialist revolution. 
 Thus, Engels feared thatTurati would find himself in the false position of a leaderwho did not understand the social significance of the revolu-tion in which he was taking part. 
 Accordingly, we mustsay again of Plekhanov that he confounds democratic with socialist revolution. 
 But perhaps we might find in Marx and Engels an answer which, though not applying to the concrete situation in Russia, would apply to the general principles of the revolu-tionary struggle of the proletariat? Iskra at any rate raises one such general question. 
 It states in issue No. 
 93: “The best way to organise the proletariat into a party in opposition to the bourgeois-dem-ocratic state is to develop the bourgeois revolution from below through the pressure of the proletariat on the democrats in power. 
” Iskra goes on: “ Vperyod wants the pressure of the proletariat on the revolution [?] to be exerted not only from below, not only from the street, but also from above, fromthe marble halls of the provisional government. 
” This for-mulation is correct; Vperyod does want this. 
 We have here a really general question of principle: is revolutionary actionpermissible only from below, or also from above? To this general question we can find an answer in Marx and Engels. 
 I have in mind Engels’ interesting article “The Bakunin-ists at Work” 122 (1873). 
 Engels describes briefly the Span-ish Revolution of 1873, when the country was swept by arevolution of the Intransigentes, i. 
e. 
, the extreme republicans. 
Engels stresses the fact that the immediate emancipation of the working class was out of the question at that time. 
 The task was to accelerate for the proletariat the tran-sition through the preliminary stages that prepare the socialrevolution and to clear the obstacles in its way. 
 The workingclass of Spain could utilise this opportunity only by takingan active part in the revolution. 
 In this it was hindered by the influence of the Bakuninists and, among other things, by their idea of the general strike, which Engels criticised soeffectively. 
 Engels describes, in passing, the events in Alcoy,a city with 30,000 factory workers, where the proletariatfound itself master of the situation. 
 How did the proletariatact? Despite the principles of Bakuninism, they were obligated to participate in the provisional revolutionary government. 
 “The Bakuninists,” says Engels, “had for yearsbeen propagating the idea that all revolutionary actionfrom above downward was pernicious, and that every-thing must be organised and carried out from below upward. 
” This, then, is Engels’ answer to the general question of “from above or from below” raised by Iskra . 
 The “Iskra ” prin-ciple of “only from below and never from above ” is an anarchist principle . 
 Drawing his conclusion from the events of the Spanish revolution, Engels says: “The Bakuninists repudiat-ed the credo which they had just proclaimed: that the estab-lishment of a revolutionary government was only a new deception and a new betrayal of the working class [asPlekhanov is trying to persuade us now], by figuring quitecomplacently on the government committees of the variouscities, and at that almost everywhere as an impotent minor-ity outvoted and exploited politically by the bourgeoisie. 
” Thus , what displeases Engels is the fact that the Bakunin-ists were in the minority , and not the fact that they sat there on these committees . 
 At the conclusion of his pamphlet, Engels declares that the example of the Bakuninists is“an example of how not to make a revolution. 
” If Martov confined his revolutionary work exclusively to action from below, he would be repeating the mistake of the Bakuninists. 
 Iskra , however, after inventing differences on points of principle with Vperyod , comes round to our own point of view. 
 Martynov, for instance, says that the proletariat, incommon with the people, must force the bourgeoisie to con-summate the revolution. 
 This, however, is nothing but the revolutionary dictatorship of “the people”, viz. 
, of the pro-letariat and the peasantry. 
 The bourgeoisie has no wish what-ever to consummate the revolution. 
 But the people cannothelp wanting this because of the social conditions of theirexistence. 
 The revolutionary dictatorship will educate them and draw them into political life. 
 Iskra writes in issue No. 
 95: “If, however, we should finally be swept into power against our will by the inner dialectics of the revolution at a time when the national conditions for the establishment of socialism are not yet mature, we would not back out. 
 We would make it our aim to break down the nar-row national framework of the revolution and impel the Western worldtowards revolution, as France impelled the East a century ago. 
” Thus, Iskra itself admits that, were it our misfortune to be victorious, we should have to act in keeping with theVperyod position. 
 Hence , in the practical aspect of the ques-tion, “Iskra ” follows “Vperyod ” and undermines its own posi-tion. 
 The only thing I fail to understand is how Martov and Martynov can be dragged to power against their own will. 
If ever there was idiocy! Iskra cites France as an example. 
 But that was Jacobin France. 
 To make a bogy of Jacobinism in time of revolu-tion is a cheap trick. 
 A democratic dictatorship, as I have pointed out, is not an organisation of “order”, but an organ-isation of war. 
 Even if we did seize St. 
 Petersburg and guil-lotined Nicholas, we would still have several Vendées 123 t o deal with. 
 Marx understood this perfectly when in 1848,in the Neue Rheinische Zeitung , he recalled the Jacobins. 
 He said that “the Reign of Terror of 1793 was nothing but a plebeian manner of settling accounts with absolutism andcounter-revolution. 
” 124 We, too, prefer to settle accounts with the Russian autocracy by “plebeian” methods and leaveGirondist methods to Iskra The situation confronting the Russian revolution is singularly auspicious (an anti-popular war, the Asiatic conservatism of the autocracy, etc. 
), and it justifies the hope that the uprising may prove successful. 
The revolutionary temper of the proletariat is mountingalmost hourly. 
 At such a moment Martynovism is not merefolly, but a downright crime, for it saps the revolutionaryenergy of the proletariat, clips the wings of its revolutionary enthusiasm. 
 ( Lyadov : “Hear, hear!”) It is the mistake Bern-stein made in the German Party, under different circum-stances, on the question, not of the democratic, but of thesocialist dictatorship. 
 To give you a definite idea of what these celebrated “marble halls” of the provisional revolutionary government are really like, I shall quote still another source. 
 In his article “Die Reichsverfassungskampagne ” * Engels recounts how he took part in a revolution in the precincts of these “mar-ble halls”. 
 He describes, for instance, the uprising in RhenishPrussia, which was one of the most industrialised centresin Germany. 
 The chances for the victory of the democratic party, he says, were particularly strong there. 
 The thing to do was to rush all available forces to the right bank ofthe Rhine, spread the insurrection over a wider area and tryto set up the nucleus of a revolutionary army with theaid of the Landwehr (militia). 
 This was precisely what Engels proposed when he went to Elberfeld to do everything possible to put his plan into operation. 
 He attacks the *“The Campaign for an Imperial Constitution”. 
— Ed. 
 petty-bourgeois leaders for their inability to organise the insurrection, for their failure to furnish funds, for instance, for the maintenance of the workers fighting on the barri-cades, etc. 
 They should have acted more energetically, hesays. 
 Their first step should have been to disarm the Elber-feld Citizens’ Army and distribute its arms among the work-ers, and then to levy a compulsory tax for the maintenanceof the workers thus armed. 
 But this suggestion, says Engels, came only and exclusively from me. 
 The highly respectable Committee of Public Safety was not in the leastinclined to take such “terrorist measures”. 
 Thus, while our Marx and Engels—that is, Martynov and Martov ( Homeric laughter )—try to frighten us with the bogy of Jacobinism, Engels castigated the revolutionary petty bourgeoisie for its disdain of the “Jacobin” mode of opera-tion. 
 He understood that going to war and—in the courseof the war—renouncing the State Treasury and governmentpower meant engaging in an unworthy game of words. 
 Where,then, will you get money for the uprising, if it becomes anall-people’s uprising, gentlemen of the new Iskra ? Not from the State Treasury, surely? That is bourgeois! That is Jaco-binism! Concerning the uprising in Baden Engels writes that “the insurgent government had every chance of success, in thatit found ... a ready army, well-stocked arsenals ... a full StateTreasury, and what was practically solid support of the pop-ulation”. 
 After the event everyone understood what had to be done under the circumstances. 
 What had to be done wasto organise an army for the protection of the NationalAssembly, to drive the Austrians and Prussians back, tospread the revolt to the neighbouring states, and “bring thetrembling German so-called National Assembly under the terroristic influence of an insurgent population and insur-gent army.... 
 It was necessary, furthermore, to centralisethe power of the insurrection, put the necessary funds atits disposal and win for the insurrection the sympathy of thevast farming majority of the population by immediatelyabolishing all feudal burdens.... 
 All this should have been done at once, however, if it was to be carried out promptly. 
 A week after the appointment of the Committee of Safetyit was too late”. 
 We are convinced that when the uprising starts in Russia the revolutionary Social-Democrats, following the example of Engels, will enlist as soldiers of the revolution and will give the same kind of “Jacobin” advice. 
 But our Iskra prefers to discuss the colour of the ballot envelopes, relegating to thebackground the question of the provisional revolutionarygovernment and of a revolutionary guard for the ConstituentAssembly. 
 Our Iskra will not act “from above” under any circumstances. 
 From Karlsruhe Engels went to Pfalz, where his friend D’Ester (who had once freed Engels from arrest) was on theprovisional government. 
 “Official participation in a move-ment that was utterly alien to our party was plainly out ofthe question in this case as well,” Engels says. 
 He had “to take the only position in this movement that anyone working on the Neue Rheinische Zeitung could take: that of a soldier”. 
 We have spoken of the break-up of the Communist League,which deprived Engels of practically all ties with the work-ers’ organisations. 
 This clarifies the passage we quoted:“I was offered many civilian and military posts,” writes Engels, “posts that I would not have hesitated for a moment to accept in a proletarian movement. 
 Under the circum-stances I declined them all. 
” As we see, Engels did not fear to act from above; he did not fear that the proletariat might become too organisedand too strong, which could lead to its participation in the provisional government. 
 On the contrary, he regretted that the movement was not successful enough, not proletarianenough, because the workers were completely unorganised. 
But even under these circumstances, Engels accepted a post;he served in the army as Willich’s adjutant, took over thedelivery of ammunition, transporting under the greatest difficulties powder, lead, cartridges, etc. 
 “To die for the republic was (thenceforward) my aim,” writes Engels. 
 I leave it to you, comrades, to judge whether this picture of a provisional government drawn according to the words ofEngels resembles the “marble halls” which the new Iskra is holding up as a bogy to frighten the workers away from us.

) 14 DRAFT RESOLUTION ON THE PROVISIONAL REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENT 1. 
 Whereas both the direct interests of the Russian prole-tariat and those of its struggle for the ultimate aims of socialism require the fullest possible measure of politicalfreedom, and, consequently, the replacement of the autocraticform of government by the democratic republic; 2. 
 Whereas the armed uprising of the people, if completely successful, i. 
e. 
, if the autocracy is overthrown, will neces-sarily bring about the establishment of a provisional revolu-tionary government, which alone is capable of securingcomplete freedom of agitation and of convening a Constitu-ent Assembly that will really express the will of the people,an Assembly elected on the basis of universal, direct, andequal suffrage by secret ballot; and 3. 
 Whereas this democratic revolution in Russia will not weaken, but, on the contrary, will strengthen the domi-nation of the bourgeoisie, which, at a certain juncture, willinevitably go to all lengths to take away from the Russianproletariat as many of the gains of the revolutionary periodas possible;— Therefore, the Third Congress of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 resolves: a) that we should spread among the working class the conviction that a provisional revolutionary government isabsolutely necessary, and discuss at workers’ meetings theconditions required for the full and prompt realisation ofall the immediate political and economic demands of our programme; b) that in the event of the victorious uprising of the people and the complete overthrow of the autocracy, representa-tives of our Party may participate in the provisional revolu-tionary government for the purpose of waging a relentless struggle against all counter-revolutionary attempts and of defending the independent interests of the working class; c) that essential conditions for such participation are strict control of its representatives by the Party, and theconstant safeguarding of the independence of the Social-Democratic Party, which strives for the complete socialist revolution, and, consequently, is irreconcilably opposed to all the bourgeois parties; d) that, irrespective of whether participation of Social-Democrats in the provisional revolutionary governmentis possible or not, we must propagate among the broadestsections of the proletariat the idea that the armed proletar-iat, led by the Social-Democratic Party, must bring to bear constant pressure on the provisional government for thepurpose of defending, consolidating, and extending thegains of the revolution. 
 Written prior to April 18 (May 1), 1905 15 SPEECH ON THE AMENDMENTS TO THE RESOLUTION ON THE PROVISIONAL REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENT APRIL 19 (MAY 2) On the whole I share the opinion of Comrade Zimin. 
 It is only natural that, as publicist, I should have given myattention to the literary formulation of the question. 
 Com-rade Zimin has very properly stressed the importance of theaim which our struggle pursues, and I subscribe to all hehas said. 
 You cannot fight if you do not expect to capture the point you are fighting for.... 
 Comrade Zimin’s amendment to Point 2: “that the estab-lishment, etc. 
 ... a provisional government, which alone”,etc. 
, is quite to the purpose, and I readily accept it. 
 This is likewise true of the amendment to Point 3; it is very appropriate to show here that under the present social and economic conditions the bourgeoisie will of necessity grow stronger. 
 In point (a) of the resolution, the wording “the proletar-iat will demand” is better than my formulation, since itshifts the emphasis to the proletariat. 
 In point (b) the refer-ence to the dependence on the relation of forces is also quite appropriate. 
 This formulation, in my opinion, renders Comrade Andreyev’s amendment unnecessary. 
 125 Inciden-tally, I should like to know the opinion of the comrades fromRussia as to whether the expression “immediate demands”is clear enough or whether we should not add “the minimumprogramme” in parenthesis. 
 In point (c) I use the word “are”, while Comrade Zimin proposes “should be”; evidently a sty-listic correction is needed here. 
 Where Party control is dealtwith, I think my old formulation “the safeguarding of the independence of the Social-Democratic Party” is better than “preserving”, which Comrade Zimin proposes. 
 Our task is not only to “preserve” the independence of the Social-Democratic Party, but constantly to “safeguard” it. 
 ComradeSosnovsky’s amendment to this point only mars the formula-tion by making it vaguer. 
 Comrade Andreyev’s proposalsfor changes are covered in part in the points of my resolu-tion and of Comrade Zimin’s. 
 Incidentally, it is hardly appro-priate to put “provisional government” in the plural in the formulation, as Comrade Andreyev proposes. 
 Of course, wemay have many provisional governments; but we shouldnot make a point of it, for we do not in any sense strive forsuch partitioning. 
 We shall always stand for a singleprovisional government of all-Russia and strive to create “a single centre, and a Russian one at that”. 
 ( Laughter . 
) 16 REPORT ON THE RESOLUTION ON THE SUPPORT OF THE PEASANT MOVEMENT APRIL 19 (MAY 2) In view of the statement of seventeen comrades calling attention to the urgent need for speeding up the work of theCongress, I shall try to be as brief as possible. 
 Strictly speak-ing, there are no moot points of principle in the questionunder discussion; none arose even during the Party crisis,which was rich in differences on points of “principle”. 
 Moreover, the draft resolution was published in Vperyod quite some time ago; I shall therefore confine myself merelyto supporting the resolution. 
 The question of supporting the peasant movement divides itself into two aspects: (1) fundamentals, and (2) the prac-tical experience of the Party. 
 The latter will be dealt with by our second reporter, Comrade Barsov, 126 who is thor-oughly familiar with our most advanced peasant move-ment—that in Guria. 
 As regards the fundamentals involved,it is now a matter of reaffirming the slogans elaborated bySocial-Democracy and adapting them to the peasant move-ment of today. 
 This movement is growing and spreading before our eyes. 
 The government is up to its old game of trying to fool the peasantry with sham concessions. 
 Thispolicy of corruption must be countered with the slogans ofour Party. 
 These slogans, in my opinion, are set forth in the following Draft Resolution: “The Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, as the party of the class-conscious proletariat, strives to bringabout the complete emancipation of all working people from every kind of exploitation, and supports every revolu-tionary movement against the present social and political system. 
 Therefore, the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 strongly supports the present-day peasant movement, among others, and stands forall revolutionary measures capable of improving the conditionof the peasantry, not halting at the expropriation of the landedestates to this end. 
 At the same time, as the class party ofthe proletariat, the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 works undeviatingly towards an independent class organisation of the rural proletarians, ever mindful of its obligation to make clear to them theantagonism of their interests to those of the peasant bourgeoi-sie, to bring them to understand that only the common strug-gle of the rural and the urban proletariat against the whole ofbourgeois society can lead to the socialist revolution, which alone is capable of really freeing the mass of the rural poor from poverty and exploitation. 
 “As a practical slogan for agitation among the peasantry, and as a means of instilling the utmost political conscious-ness into this movement, the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 proposes theimmediate formation of revolutionary peasant committees for all-round support of all democratic reforms and for their implementation in detail. 
 In these committees as well theR. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 will strive for an independent organisation ofthe rural proletarians for the purpose of supporting theentire peasantry in all its revolutionary-democratic actions,on the one hand, and, on the other, of safeguarding the true interests of the rural proletariat in its struggle against the peasant bourgeoisie” ( Vperyod , No. 
 11 *). 
 This Draft was discussed by the Agrarian Committee, which the delegates had appointed in advance of the Congressfor its preparation. 
 Although opinion was considerablydivided, certain major trends were clearly in evidence, and it is with these that I intend to deal. 
 The nature of the pos-sible and necessary revolutionary measures in the sphere ofthe agrarian question is according to the Draft Resolution“the improvement in the condition of the peasantry”. 
 Thus,the Resolution clearly expresses thereby the general convic-tion of all Social-Democrats that no fundamental change in the present social and economic system can be achieved by *See pp. 
 235-36 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 these measures. 
 In this we differ from the Socialists-Revo-lutionaries. 
 The revolutionary movement of the peasants may lead to a considerable improvement in their condition, but not to the supplanting of capitalism by another mode ofproduction. 
 The Resolution speaks of measures that will not halt at the expropriation of the landed estates. 
 It has been saidthat this formulation modifies our agrarian programme. 
 I consider this opinion wrong. 
 The wording could be im-proved, of course, to read that it is the peasantry and not ourParty that will not halt at expropriation; our Party supportsthe peasantry and will support it also when it does not haltat such measures. 
 The narrower concept “confiscation”should be used instead of expropriation, since we are emphati-cally opposed to compensation in any shape or form. 
 We will never hesitate to employ such measures as confiscation ofthe land. 
 But apart from these partial emendations, we seenothing in our Resolution that modifies our agrarian pro-gramme. 
 All Social-Democratic publicists have constantlyexpressed the view that the point concerning the cut-off lands does not by any means set limits to the peasant movement, either to curtail or to restrict it. 
 Both Plekhanov and I havestated in the press that the Social-Democratic Party willnever hold the peasantry back from revolutionary measuresof agrarian reform, including the “general redistribution” 127 of the land. 
 Thus, we are not modifying our agrarian pro-gramme. 
 We must now take a definite stand on the practical question of consistent support to the peasants, to avoidany possible misunderstandings or misinterpretations. 
 Thepeasant movement is now on the order of the day, and theparty of the proletariat should declare officially that it givesthis movement full support and does not in any way limit its scope. 
 The Resolution goes on to speak of the need to bring the interests of the rural proletariat into focus and to organisethis proletariat separately. 
 There is hardly any need to defendthis simple axiom before a gathering of Social-Democrats. 
It was stated in the Agrarian Committee that it would be a good thing to add a point on the support of strikes of the farm labourers and peasants, especially during the har-vesting, haymaking, etc. 
 In principle, of course, there can be nothing against this. 
 Let our practical workers say what they think of the possible significance of such a point for the immediate future. 
 The Resolution further speaks of the formation of revo-lutionary peasant committees. 
 The idea that the demand for the immediate formation of revolutionary peasant committees should be made the pivotof our agitation was developed in Vperyod , No. 
 15. 
 * Even the reactionaries now talk of “improving the living condi-tions”, but they stand for an official, bureaucratic way ofpseudo-improvement, whereas the Social-Democrats, ofcourse, must stand for the revolutionary way of effecting theimprovement. 
 The main task is to instil political conscious-ness into the peasant movement. 
 The peasants know what they want in a vague sort of way, but they are unable to see their wishes and demands in relation to the entire politicalsystem. 
 That is why they are such easy game for politicaltricksters, who reduce the question of political changes toeconomic “improvements”, which cannot really be effectedwithout political changes. 
 Therefore, the slogan calling for revolutionary peasant committees is the only correct one. 
 Unless these committees are able to enforce the revolutionarylaw, the peasants will never be able to hold what they maynow win. 
 It is objected that here, too, we are modifying theagrarian programme, which says nothing about revolution-ary peasant committees or their functions in the field of democratic reforms. 
 This objection does not hold water. 
 We are not modifying our programme but applying it toa concrete case. 
 Since no doubt exists that the peasantcommittees cannot be anything but revolutionary underthe given conditions, by noting this fact we are merely ap-plying the programme to the revolutionary moment, not changing it. 
 Our programme, for instance, declares that we recognise the right of nations to self-determination; if con-crete conditions brought us to express ourselves in favour ofself-determination of a definite nation, of its complete inde-pendence, that would be, not a change of the programme,but its application. 
 The peasant committees are an elastic institution, suitable both under present conditions and *See pp. 
 321-22 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 under, let us say, a provisional revolutionary government, when they would become organs of the government. 
 Some hold that these committees may become reactionary instead of revolutionary. 
 But we Social-Democrats have never for-gotten the dual nature of the peasant or the possibility of areactionary peasant movement against the proletariat. 
 Notthis is the point at issue, but rather that at the present timepeasant committees formed to sanction land reforms cannot be anything but revolutionary. 
 At the present time the peas-ant movement is unquestionably revolutionary. 
 Some saythat the peasants will quieten down after they have seizedthe land. 
 Possibly. 
 But the autocratic government will notquieten down if the peasants seize the land, and this is thecrux of the matter. 
 Only a revolutionary government or revolutionary peasant committees can sanction this seizure. 
 Lastly, the concluding part of the Resolution defines once more the position of the Social-Democrats in the peasantcommittees, namely, the necessity of marching togetherwith the rural proletariat and organising it separately andindependently. 
 In the countryside, too, there can be only one consistently revolutionary class—the proletariat. 
 17 DRAFT RESOLUTION ON THE SUPPORT OF THE PEASANT MOVEMENT 1. 
 Whereas the growing peasant movement, though spon-taneous and politically unconscious, is nonetheless inevi-tably directed against the existing political order andagainst the privileged classes ; 2. 
 Whereas it is one of the tasks of Social-Democracy to support every revolutionary movement against the existingsocial and political order; 3. 
 Whereas, in view of the aforesaid, the Social-Democrats must strive to bring out the revolutionary-democraticfeatures (characteristics) of the peasant movement, touphold them and develop them to their logical conclusion;and 4. 
 Whereas the Social-Democratic Party, as the party of the proletariat, must in all cases and under all circumstances work steadfastly for the independent organisation of therural proletariat and to clarify for this class the irreconcilableantagonism between its interests and those of the peasantbourgeoisie;— Therefore, the Third Party Congress of the R.

 instructs all Party organisations: a) to carry on propaganda among the proletariat at large, explaining that the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 makes it its aim to supportwith the utmost vigour the present-day peasant movement,without opposing its revolutionary manifestations, including the confiscation of the landed estates; b) as a practical slogan for agitation among the peasantry and as a means of instilling the utmost political conscious-ness into the peasant movement, a plan should be launched for the immediate organisation of revolutionary peasant committees that shall have as their aim the carrying out of all revolutionary-democratic reforms in the interests of the peasantry and the liberation of the peasantry from thetyranny of the police, the officials, and the landlords; c) to recommend to the peasantry non-performance of mil-itary service, flat refusal to pay taxes, and refusal to recog-nise the authorities, in order to disorganise the autocratic regime and support the revolutionary onset directed against it; d) to work within the peasant committees for the independ-ent organisation of the rural proletariat and for its closestpossible association with the urban proletariat in a singleSocial-Democratic party of the working class. 
 Written on April 20 (May 3), 1905 18 SPEECH ON THE QUESTION OF THE RELATIONS BETWEEN WORKERS AND INTELLECTUALS WITHIN THE SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC ORGANISATIONS APRIL 20 (MAY 3) I cannot agree with the comrades who said it was inap-propriate to broaden the scope of this question. 
 It is quite appropriate. 
 It has been said here that the exponents of Social-Demo-cratic ideas have been mainly intellectuals. 
 That is not so. 
During the period of Economism the exponents of revolution-ary ideas were workers, not intellectuals. 
 This is confirmedby “A Worker”, the author of the pamphlet published witha foreword by Comrade Axelrod. 
 Comrade Sergeyev asserted here that the elective principle will not make for better information. 
 That is not so. 
 Ifthe elective principle were applied in practice , we should unquestionably be much better informed than we now are. 
 It has also been pointed out that splits have usually been the work of intellectuals. 
 This is an important point, but itdoes not settle the question. 
 In my writings for the press I have long urged that as many workers as possible should be placed on the committees. 
 * The period since the Second Congress has been marked by inadequate attention to thisduty—such is the impression I have received from talkswith comrades engaged in practical Party work. 
 If in Sa-ratov only one worker was placed on the committee, this means that they did not know how to choose suitable people *A Letter to a Comrade on Our Organisational Tasks , September 1902. 
 See present edition, Vol. 
 6, p. 
 235. 
— Ed. 
 from among the workers. 
 No doubt, this was due also to the split within the Party; the struggle for the committees has had a damaging effect on practical work. 
 For this very reason we endeavoured in every way possible to speed theconvening of the Congress. 
 It will be the task of the future centre to reorganise a considerable number of our committees; the inertness of thecommittee-men has to be overcome. 
 ( Applause and booing . 
) I can hear Comrade Sergeyev booing while the non-com-mittee-men applaud. 
 I think we should look at the mattermore broadly. 
 To place workers on the committees is a politi-cal, not only a pedagogical, task. 
 Workers have the classinstinct, and, given some political experience, they prettysoon become staunch Social-Democrats. 
 I should be strongly in favour of having eight workers to every two intellectuals on our committees. 
 Should the advice given in our Partyliterature—to place as many workers as possible on the com-mittees—be insufficient, it would be advisable for thisrecommendation to be given in the name of the Congress. 
A clear and definite directive from the Congress will give you a radical means of fighting demagogy; this is the express will of the Congress. 
 19 DRAFT RESOLUTION ON THE RELATIONS BETWEEN WORKERS AND INTELLECTUALS WITHIN THE SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC ORGANISATIONS 1. 
 Whereas the Right Wing of our Party still continues the systematic attempts, begun in the days of Economism,to spread hostility and distrust among the Party members—the workers and the intellectuals—attempts to represent ourParty organisations as consisting solely of intellectuals (an allegation of which the enemies of Social-Democracy make clever use); attempts to accuse the Social-Democraticorganisations of striving to fetter the initiative of the work-ing class through the instrumentality of Party discipline;attempts to flaunt the elective-principle slogan for the mostpart without any design to apply it in practice; and 2. 
 Whereas the full assertion of the elective principle, possible and necessary under conditions of political freedom,is unfeasible under the autocracy, though even under theautocracy this principle could be applied to a much largerextent than it is today, were it not for the obstacle presentedby the Party organisation’s diffuse form and actual disor-ganisation, for which the Party is indebted to the selfsame Right Wing of Social-Democracy;— Therefore, the Third Congress of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
, recog-nising its duty to prepare for the coming congresses, by aseries of organisational reforms, the pre-conditions for areal application of the elective principle in Party life, to the extent possible, calls attention once more to the task confronting the class-conscious adherents of the Social-Democratic workers’ party: that they make every effort to strengthen the ties between the Party and the masses of the working class by raising still wider sections of proletarians and semi-proletarians to full Social-Democratic conscious-ness, by developing their revolutionary Social-Democraticactivity, by seeing to it that the greatest possible numberof workers capable of leading the movement and the Partyorganisations be advanced from among the mass of theworking class to membership on the local centres and on the all-Party centre through the creation of a maximum number of working-class organisations adhering to our Party, byseeing to it that working-class organisations unwilling orunable to enter the Party should at least be associated with it. 
 Written on April 22 (May 5), 1905 20 A REMARK DURING THE DISCUSSION OF THE RESOLUTION ON THE RELATIONS BETWEEN WORKERS AND INTELLECTUALS WITHIN THE SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC ORGANISATIONS APRIL 22 (MAY 5) I could hardly keep my seat when it was said here that there are no workers fit to sit on the committees. 
 Thequestion is being dragged out; obviously there is somethingthe matter with the Party. 
 Workers must be given places on the committees. 
 Oddly enough, there are only three publicists at the Congress, the others being committee-men;it appears however that the publicists are for placing theworkers, whereas the committee-men for some reason arequite wrought up over it. 
 The statements by Comrades Golubin 128 and Mikhailov are highly valuable. 
 21 SPEECH ON THE PROCEDURE OF THE DISCUSSION OF THE RESOLUTIONS ON THE RELATIONS BETWEEN WORKERS AND INTELLECTUALS WITHIN THE SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC ORGANISATIONS APRIL 22 (MAY 5)129 I am not of accord with Comrade Sergeyev in this; it is precisely such congress resolutions that do not exist. 
 Thewishes of the publicists are not enough. 
 Besides, the resolu-tions were not rejected, but merely shifted to another item of the agenda. 
 Some point to the fact that the workers have the right, with the consent of the Central Committee, tocashier the committees. 
 That is not enough; we want adirective, not demagogy. 
 Comrade Sergeyev misinterpretsVperyod when he talks about “fine words buttering no parsnips”. 
 It is the brevity of the Rules clause that makes us adopt a resolution containing a certain directive. 
 I am against Comrade Andreyev’s proposal. 
 It is not true that it wasneither the “Economists” nor the “Mensheviks” who startedthe demagogy. 
 On the contrary, it was they who were thedemagogues. 
 Precisely this is what the resolution is—awarning against demagogy. 
 For this reason I insist upon the resolution. 
 22 SPEECH DURING THE DISCUSSION OF THE PARTY RULES APRIL 21 (MAY 4) I must confess that the arguments employed by Comrade Ivanov in defence of his idea of a single centre seem to me untenable. 
 ( The speaker reads the argumentation of Comrade Ivanov ): “On Clauses 4 and 5. 
 The system of two centres with a balancer, the Council, has been condemned by past experience. 
 The history of the Party crisis plainly shows that this system provides too favourable asoil for the growth of differences, squabbles and Court intrigues. 
 Itmeans the subordination of the people in Russia to those abroad:owing to arrests, the Central Committee personnel is unstable, whereasthe Editorial Board of the Central Organ is constant; and the Council resides abroad. 
 On the one hand, all the most important objections against a single centre, based on the actual severance of Russia from thepeople abroad, only confirm the idea that a split between the two cen-tres is possible and even probable. 
 On the other hand, these objectionslargely fall away if the Congress makes periodic conferences obligatorybetween the Russian members of the C. 
C. 
 and the members abroad. 
” It has been found, however, that the fine qualities here alluded to are possessed in equal measure both by the CentralOrgan abroad and by the “genuinely Russian” Central Com-mittee. 
 In Comrade Ivanov’s entire reasoning I discern the fallacy envisaged by logic as post hoc , ergo propter hoc . 
 * Because the three centres have, pardon the expression, played us dirty, let us have a single centre. 
 I fail to see the prop-ter here. 
 Our troubles were not due to the mechanism but to persons; what happened was that certain persons, usinga formal interpretation of the Rules as a subterfuge, *After this, therefore on account of this. 
— Ed. 
 ignored the will of the Congress. 
 Has not the “genuinely Russian” C. 
C. 
 “dialectically” turned into its exact opposite? Comrade Ivanov’s reasoning is—the group abroad has acted shabbily; we must therefore put it under a “state of siege”and keep a “tight hold” on it. 
 As you know, I have alwaysbeen an advocate of a “state of siege” and of a “tight hold”, sothat I shall raise no objection to such measures. 
 But does notthe C. 
C. 
 deserve the same treatment? Besides, who will deny that the Central Organ can be constant, while the C. 
C. 
 cannot? This, after all, is a fact. 
 But in practice I shallabstain from all polemic. 
 Formerly we had the Council,and now we shall have a conference (of the C. 
C. 
 sectionworking abroad and of the section working in Russia). 
 Adifference of only a couple of letters. 
 Our cart has been lurching all the time to the right, towards the Central Organ—Com-rade Ivanov has been laying the straw on the right side,to cushion the fall. 
 But I think it ought to be laid on the leftside as well, on the side of the C. 
C. 
 I would subscribe toComrade Mikhailov’s proposal to cashier the committees,but I really don’t know what the periphery exactly is. 
 “Chair-warmers and keepers of the seal” should all be smoked out; but how is one to define precisely the concept “periph-ery”? “Two-thirds of the votes of the periphery!”—but whocan keep a strict record of the periphery? I must, besides,warn the Congress against cramming the Rules with toomany clauses. 
 It is easy enough to pen nice clauses, but in practice they usually prove superfluous. 
 The Rules should not be made a collection of pious wishes.... 
 23 SPEECH ON THE WORDING OF CLAUSE 9 OF THE PARTY RULES APRIL 21 (MAY 4) I was for cashiering the committees, but in the Party Council, at the time when our factional strife was raging,I spoke against it, since there would have been a certainimpropriety in the exercise of that right. 
 If this clauseconstitutes a threat to the committees consisting of intel-lectuals, then I am all for it. 
 A tight hold must always be kept on the intelligentsia. 
 It is always the instigator of all sorts of squabbles, and therefore I move that we substi-tute the words “organised workers” for the word “periph-ery” ( the speaker submits his amendment in writing ): “Clause 9. 
 A local committee must be dissolved by the C. 
C. 
if two-thirds of the local workers belonging to the Party organisations declare for such dissolution. 
” One cannot rely on a small periphery of intellectuals, but one can and should rely on hundreds of organised work-ers. 
 I would like to connect this clause closely with thequestion of submitting reports. 
 In this respect we shouldtake an example from the Bund, which always knows the exact number of organised workers it has. 
 And when our C. 
C. 
 is constantly posted on the number of organised workersin any particular organisation, it will have to reckon withtheir opinion and will be bound to cashier the local commit-tee on the demand of the organised workers. 
 24 SPEECH ON AN AGREEMENT WITH THE SOCIALISTS-REVOLUTIONARIES APRIL 23 (MAY 6) I have to inform the Congress of an unsuccessful attempt to come to an agreement with the Socialists-Revolution-aries. 
 Comrade Gapon arrived abroad. 
 He met with theSocialists-Revolutionaries, then with the Iskra people, and finally with me. 
 He told me that he shared the point of viewof the Social-Democrats, but for various reasons did not deem it possible to say so openly. 
 I told him that diplomacy was a good thing, but not between revolutionaries. 
 I shall notrepeat our conversation; it was reported in Vperyod . 
 * H e impressed me as being an enterprising and clever man,unquestionably devoted to the revolution, though unfortu-nately without a consistent revolutionary outlook. 
 Some time later I received a written invitation from Com-rade Gapon to attend a conference of socialist organisations,convened, according to his idea, for the purpose of co-ordinating their activities. 
 Here is a list of the eighteenorganisations which, according to that letter, were invitedto Comrade Gapon’s conference: (1) The Socialist-Revolutionary Party, (2) the Vperyod R.

 I pointed out both to Comrade Gapon and to a prominent Socialist-Revolutionary that the dubious make-up of the conference might create difficulties. 
 The Socialists-Revolu-tionaries were building up an overwhelming conferencemajority. 
 The convocation of the conference was greatlydelayed. 
 Iskra replied, as documents submitted to me by Comrade Gapon show, that it preferred direct agreementswith organised parties. 
 A “gentle” hint at Vperyod ’s being an alleged disrupter, etc. 
 In the end Iskra did not attend the conference. 
 We, the representatives of both the Vperyod Editorial Board and the Bureau of Committees of theMajority, did attend. 
 Arriving on the scene, we saw that theconference was a Socialist-Revolutionary affair. 
 As itbecame clear, either the working-class parties had not been invited at all, or there was no record of their having been invited. 
 Thus, the Active Resistance Party of Finland wasrepresented, but not the Workers’ Party of Finland. 
 When we asked for the reason, we were told that the invitation to the Workers’ Party of Finland had been sentvia the Active Resistance Party, since, in the words of the Socialist-Revolutionary who offered the explanation, they did not know how to send it directly. 
 Yet anyone who is atall familiar with things abroad knows that connections withthe Workers’ Party of Finland can be established, if onlythrough Branting, the leader of the Swedish Social-Demo-cratic Labour Party. 
 There were representatives from the Polish Socialist Party in attendance, but no representative from the Social-Democracy of Poland and Lithuania. 
 Norwas it possible to ascertain whether an invitation had beenextended. 
 No reply had been received from the LithuanianSocial-Democracy or from the Ukrainian RevolutionaryParty, we were told by the same Socialist-Revolutionary. 
 From the outset the national question was made an issue. 
 The Polish Socialist Party raised the question of havingseveral constituent assemblies. 
 This gives me reason to say that in the future it will be necessary for us either to refuse outright to take any part in such conferences, or to convene a conference of representatives of the working-class parties of one nationality, or to invite to the conference represent-atives of local party committees from the regions with anon-Russian population. 
 But I certainly do not infer fromthis that conferences are impossible because of differenceson points of principle. 
 All that is necessary is that only practical questions be taken up. 
 We cannot control the composition of conferences, etc. 
, from abroad. 
 The Russian centre must be represented, andrepresentatives of the local committees must take part with-out fail. 
 The question that led to our withdrawal concernedthe Letts. 
 On leaving the conference we submitted the following declaration: “The important historical period through which Russia is passing confronts the Social-Democratic and revolutionary-democratic parties and organisations working within the country with the task of reaching a practical agreement for a more effective attack on the autocraticregime. 
 “While, therefore, attaching very great importance to the conference called for that purpose, we must naturally subject thecomposition of the conference to the closest scrutiny. 
 “In the conference called by Comrade Gapon this condition, so essential to its success, has unfortunately not been properly observed,and we were therefore obliged, at its very initiation, to take measurescalculated to ensure the genuine success of the gathering. 
 “The fact that the conference was to deal solely with practical mat-ters made it necessary, in the first place, that only organisations truly constituting a real force in Russia should be afforded participation. 
 “Actually, the composition of the conference, as far as the reality of some of the organisations is concerned, is most unsatisfactory. 
 Evenan organisation of whose fictitious nature there is not the slightestdoubt, found representation. 
 We refer to the Lettish Social-DemocraticLeague. 
 “The representative of the Lettish Social-Democratic Labour Party objected to the seating of this League and couched his objection in theform of an ultimatum. 
 “The utter fictitiousness of the ‘League’, as subsequently established at a special meeting of the representatives of the four Social-Democratic organisations and the delegates of the ‘League’, naturally compelled us, the remaining Social-Democratic organisations and parties attending the conference, to endorse the ultimatum. 
 “At the outset, however, we came up against the strong resistance of all the revolutionary-democratic parties, which, in refusing to meetour peremptory demand, showed that they preferred one fictitious “Finally, the practical significance of the conference was still further lowered by the absence of a number of other Social-Democraticorganisations, whose participation, as far as we could ascertain, noproper measures had been taken to ensure. 
 “Though compelled, in view of all this, to leave the conference, we express our conviction that the failure of this one attempt will notstand in the way of earnest efforts to renew the endeavour in the verynear future, and that the task that confronts all revolutionary partiesof reaching a practical agreement will be accomplished by the comingconference, to be composed of organisations actually working in Rus-sia, and not of fictitious organisations.

” A week and a half or two weeks later Comrade Gapon sent me the following statement: “Dear Comrade, “I am forwarding to you two declarations issued by the conference of which you know, and I request that you communicate their contentsto the forthcoming Third Congress of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 I deem it myduty to state that for my own part I accept these declarations with certain reservations on the questions of the socialist programme and the principle of federalism. 
 “Georgi Gapon. 
” This statement was accompanied by two interesting documents, containing the following striking passages: “The application of the federative principle to the relations between nationalities remaining under one state roof.... 
 “Socialisation, i. 
e. 
, the transfer under public administration to the use by the labouring agricultural population of all lands whose culti-vation is based on the exploitation of the labour of others; the determi-nation of the concrete forms this measure is to take, of the order inwhich it is to be instituted, and of its scope, is to remain within the jurisdiction of the parties of the different nationalities, in keeping with the specific local conditions of each country; the development of public,municipal, and communal economy.... 
 “... Bread for the starving! “The land and its bounties for all the toilers!“... A Constituent Assembly of representatives of all parts of the Russian Empire, exclusive of Poland and Finland! “... Convocation of a Constituent Assembly for the Caucasus, as The result of the conference, as appears from these quotations has fully confirmed the fears which induced us to leave the conference. 
 We have here a copy of the Socialist-Revolutionary programme with all sorts of concessions tothe nationalist non-proletarian parties. 
 It was strange takingpart in deciding the questions raised at the conferencewithout the participation of the national proletarianparties. 
 For instance, the conference presented the demand for a separate Constituent Assembly for Poland. 
 We can be neither for nor against the demand. 
 Our programme recog-nises the principle of the self-determination of nationalities. 
But to decide this question without the Social-Democracyof Poland and Lithuania is impermissible. 
 The conferencedivided up the Constituent Assembly, and this in the absence of the working-class parties! We cannot allow any practical solution of such questions to be reached without the partyof the proletariat. 
 At the same time, I find that differences on points of principle do not exclude the possibility of practicalconferences, provided, first, that they be held in Russia; secondly, that the reality of the forces be verified; and, thirdly, that questions concerning the various nationalities be dealtwith separately, or at least, that representatives of the localcommittees of the regions where there are Social-Democraticand non-Social-Democratic national parties be invited to theconference. 
 I now pass to the proposed resolution on practical agree-ments with the Socialists-Revolutionaries. 
 ( The speaker reads the draft as worded by Comrade Voinov ): “Confirming the attitude of the R.

 We might perhaps tone down the end. 
 For instance, instead of “under the direct supervisionof the Central Committee”, we might have only “under thesupervision of the Central Committee”. 
 25 SPEECH ON THE REPORT ON THE WORK OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE APRIL 25 (MAY 8) Actually, the report on the work of the Central Committee dealt more with its technical than its political activities. 
I have been following the work of the central apparatusof the Party since 1900 and I must say that gigantic progresshas been made. 
 If it does not quite satisfy us, well, completesatisfaction can be expected only under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and even then, hardly! Let us not forget that “co-optation” is still working harm! The C. 
C. 
 had little tosay about its policies, for it cannot say anything good aboutthem. 
 Its major mistake was its opposition to the calling ofthe Congress. 
 Had the Congress been called a year earlier,it would have proved more conciliatory. 
 I am myself in favour of cashiering; but I am definitely against it in one case—if it is done because of agitation for the Congress. 
However, I shall not dwell on this. 
 There is more joy over onesinner that repenteth than over ninety and nine just per-sons. 
 As to the reproaches levelled at me, let me say onlythat a publicist is not in a position to do anything without the Party. 
 /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR 26 RESOLUTION ON THE PUBLICATION OF THE CONGRESS PROCEEDINGS130 The Congress instructs the Central Committee to proceed immediately to the publication of a brief report on the Third Congress with the full text of the Programme, the Rules,and the Resolutions. 
 The Congress instructs the Central Committee to speed the publication of this report in every possible way. 
 The Congress instructs the Congress Proceedings Publi-cation Committee: (1) to determine definitely what materials, for reasons of secrecy, are not to be published under anycircumstances; (2) to determine in what manner and to whatextent the Party membership should be made acquaintedwith the unpublished proceedings of the Third Congress;(3) to make the necessary cuts for publication, exclusively in regard to the discussion of points of order or of rejected minor amendments to the resolutions. 
 Written on April 25 (May 8), 1905 27 DRAFT RESOLUTION ON THE EVENTS IN THE CAUCASUS131 1. 
 Whereas the specific social and political conditions in the Caucasus have favoured the creation there of the most militant organisations of our Party; 2. 
 Whereas the revolutionary mood of the majority of the population in the Caucasus, both in the towns and inthe villages, has reached the stage of a people’s uprisingagainst the autocracy; 3. 
 Whereas the autocratic government has begun to send troops and artillery to Guria for the ruthless destruction of all the important seats of rebellion; and 4. 
 Whereas a victory of the autocracy over the popular uprising in the Caucasus, which would be rendered easierby the non-Russian composition of the population, wouldmost grievously affect the success of the uprising throughout Russia;— Therefore, the Third Congress of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, on behalf of the class-consciousproletariat of Russia, sends ardent greetings to the heroicproletariat and peasantry of the Caucasus and instructsthe Central Committee and the local Party committees to take the most energetic measures towards promulgating information on the state of affairs in the Caucasus as widelyas possible by means of pamphlets, meetings, workers’rallies, study circle talks, etc. 
, as well as measures towardsrendering timely support to the Caucasus by armed force. 
 Written on April 26 (May 9), 1905 POLITICAL SOPHISMS The Russian revolution has only just begun, but already all the features peculiar to political revolutions of thebourgeoisie stand clearly revealed. 
 The lower classes fight, the upper reap the benefit of it. 
 All the incredible hardships of the revolutionary struggle have fallen upon theproletariat, as a class, and on a few young intellectuals fromamong the bourgeoisie. 
 Nine-tenths of all the liberties thathave been partially won (rather, scant strips of liberty)go to the upper classes of society, to those who do not work. 
 Despite the law, there is now incomparably greater freedom of speech, assembly, and the press in Russia than there wasten years, one year, ago; but only the bourgeois newspapersand the “liberal” meetings benefit thereby to any extentworth mentioning. 
 In their powerful urge towards freedomthe workers keep forcing their way into new realms hitherto thought inaccessible to them; but this infiltration of the proletarian element proves, rather than refutes, our point. 
Active participation in the political struggle is in inverseratio to the active appropriation of its fruits. 
 The moreadvantageous the status of a given class in the socio-economic structure is, the more “advantageous” is the relation between the legal and the illegal movement (i. 
e. 
, between what is permitted by law and what is contrary to the law). 
 Themovement of the liberal bourgeoisie, especially sinceJanuary 9, has spread so widely in forms tolerated by the law that the illegal liberal movement has begun to dwindlebefore our very eyes with amazing rapidity. 
 The movement of the working class, despite its assumptions, in one of its crucial phases, of an ultra-“legal” form (the presentation of apetition to the tsar by the working people of St. 
 Petersburg), finds itself completely outlawed and subject to harsh military reprisals. 
 The movement of the working class has grown incomparably wider, but the relation between the legal and the illegal elements has hardly changed in favour of the former. 
 Whence this difference? Because the whole social and eco-nomic structure of Russia yields most fruit to those whowork the least. 
 Under capitalism that cannot be otherwise. 
It is the law of capital, which rules the political as well as the economic life. 
 The movement of the lower classes raises a revolutionary force; it raises a mass of people, who, for onething, are capable of tearing down the whole rotten structure,and, for another, are not attached to that structure by anyspecial features of their position and would gladly tear itdown. 
 What is more, even though they are not fully conscious of their aims, these masses are nonetheless able and prone to tear the structure down, because their position isdesperate, since constant oppression drives them to take therevolutionary way, and they have nothing to lose but theirchains. 
 This popular force, the proletariat, looms formidablebefore the lords of the rotten structure because there is some-thing in the very position of the proletariat that is a menace to all exploiters. 
 For that reason, any movement of theproletariat, however small, however modest it may be at thestart, however slight its occasion, inevitably threatens tooutgrow its immediate aims and to develop into a forceirreconcilable to the entire old order and destructive of it. 
 The movement of the proletariat, by reason of the essential peculiarities of the position of this class undercapitalism, has a marked tendency to develop into a desperateall-out struggle, a struggle for complete victory over all the dark forces of exploitation and oppression. 
 The move-ment of the liberal bourgeoisie, on the contrary, and for the same reasons (i. 
e. 
, by virtue of the essential peculiarities of the bourgeoisie’s position), has a tendency towards com-promise instead of struggle, towards opportunism instead ofradicalism, towards modest calculation of the likeliest andmost possible immediate gains instead of a “tactless”, bold,and determined bid for complete victory. 
 He who puts up a real fight will naturally go all out ; he who prefers compro-mise to struggle will naturally point out beforehand what“morsels” he would be inclined, at best, to content himself with (at worst, he would be content even with no struggle at all, i. 
e. 
, he would make a lasting peace with the masters of the old world). 
 It is therefore quite natural for Social-Democracy, as the party of the revolutionary proletariat, to be so concernedfor its programme , to take such pains to establish well in advance its ultimate aim, the complete emancipation of theworking people, and jealously to guard this aim against any attempts to whittle it down. 
 For the same reasons Social-Democracy is so dogmatically strict and firmly doctrinairein keeping its ultimate goal clear of all minor, immediateeconomic and political aims. 
 He who goes all out , who fights for complete victory, must alert himself to thedanger of having his hands tied by minor gains, of being led astray and made to forget that which is still comparatively remote, but without which all minor gains are hollow vanities. 
Such concern for the programme and the ever critical attitudetowards small and gradual improvements are incompre-hensible and foreign to a party of the bourgeoisie, howevergreat its love for freedom and the people may be. 
 We were launched upon these reflections by the “Draft of a Russian Constitution”, recently published by Osvo-bozhdeniye under the title “The Fundamental State Law of the Russian Empire”. 
 This draft, known in Russia for sometime, has now been issued with annotations and an explan-atory comment as “the only complete, definitive edition revised by the authors themselves”. 
 It appears that this draft originates, not with the Osvobozhdeniye League, but rather with a private group belonging to the League. 
 Thus, we seehere once again the dread of a clear, definite, and straight-forward programme, which is typical of liberalism. 
 The libe-ral party in Russia possesses immeasurably greater funds and publication capacities, and immeasurably greater freedom of movement on legal ground than does Social-Democracy;yet, with regard to programmatic definiteness, it fallsstrikingly behind Social-Democracy. 
 The liberals fight shy ofprogrammes; they prefer various contradictory statementsin their newspaper (e. 
g. 
, on the question of universal suf-frage), or the “drafts” of private groups, which do not in any way commit the party as a whole (or the whole Osvobozh-deniye League). 
 This is no accident, of course. 
 It is the inevitable result of the bourgeoisie’s social position, as a class, in modern society—a class caught between the autocracy and the proletariat and rent into factions over petty differ-ences in interests. 
 Political sophisms follow naturallyfrom such a situation. 
 We should like to draw the reader’s attention to one such sophism. 
 The main features of Osvobozhdeniye ’s draft constitution are well known: the monarchy is retained— the question of the republic is not even discussed (appar-ently the “ Realpolitiker ” of the bourgeoisie do not consider this question important enough!); a bicameral parliamentary system is to be set up with universal, direct , and equal suffrage by secret ballot for the Lower House, and withtwo-stage elections for the Upper. 
 The members of the Upper House are to be elected by the Zemstvo Assemblies and the municipal councils. 
 There is no need to dwell on thedetails of this draft. 
 The interest lies in its general conceptionand its advocacy on grounds of principle. 
 Our generous-spirited liberals want to share the state power as evenly and “fairly” as possible among three forces: the monarch, the Upper House (the Zemstvo House), and the Lower House (the House of People’s Representatives), thatis, the autocratic bureaucracy, the bourgeoisie, and the“people” (the proletariat, the peasantry, and the petty bour-geoisie at large). 
 The liberal publicists, in their heart ofhearts, want the strife between these contending forces and the various combinations of these forces to be superseded by a “fair” concord of unity ... on paper! The thing is tohave a gradual, balanced development, to justify universalsuffrage from the point of view of the conservatives (Mr. 
Struve’s preface to this draft); a real guarantee for theinterests of the ruling classes (i. 
e. 
, real conservatism) is to be created in the form of the monarchy and the Upper House; and this supposedly cunning, but actually very naïve,construction is to be clothed in highflown sophisms. 
 TheRussian proletariat will have to deal with liberal sophismsfor a long time to come. 
 It is time we examined them moreclosely. 
 The liberals begin their defence of the bicameral system by analysing anticipated objections to it. 
 Characteristic-ally, these objections are borrowed entirely from the usual font of liberal-Narodnik ideas, which are being widely promulgated by our legal press. 
 The nature of Russian society, it is claimed, is “profoundly democratic” and there is nothing in Russia like an upper class that owes its strengthto its political services, to wealth, etc. 
, for our nobility hasbeen a class of servants of the government without “politicalambitions”, besides which its material power has been“sapped”. 
 From the point of view of a Social-Democrat it is absurd to take this Narodnik phrase-mongering seriously; there is not a word of truth in it. 
 The political privilegesenjoyed by the nobility in Russia are only too well known;the nobility’s strength is plainly evident in the tendenciesof the conservative and moderate, or Shipov, party; itsmaterial power is “sapped” only by the bourgeoisie, with which the nobility is merging, and which does not in the least prevent it from amassing immense wealth thatenables it to rob tens of millions of toilers. 
 The class-consciousworkers should have no illusions on this score. 
 Narodnikphrase-mongering on the insignificance of the Russiannobility merely serves the liberals as a means of sugaring the pill of future constitutional privileges of the nobility. 
 This liberal logic is psychologically inevitable; our nobility mustbe depicted as negligible in order that its privileges may seemonly a negligible departure from democracy. 
 With the bourgeoisie occupying a position between the hammer and the anvil, idealistic phrases, too, are psycho-logically inevitable, phrases which our liberals in general and their pet philosophers in particular are now mouthingwith such bad taste. 
 “As far as the Russian liberation move-ment is concerned,” we read in the explanatory comment,“democracy is not only a fact but a moral and political pos-tulate. 
 It places moral justification for any social form above its historical justification.... 
” Not a bad example of the turgid meaningless phraseology with which our liberals“justify” their approach towards betrayal of democracy!They complain of the “ obloquy [?l that is heaped upon the Russian liberal party by representatives of the more extremeelements, who allege that this party seeks to put a bour-geois-aristocratic autocracy in the place of the bureaucratic autocracy”—yet our liberals would have the only trulydemocratic institution in their scheme, the House of People’s Representatives, share power with both the monarchy and the Upper, Zemstvo, House! Their “ethical” and “moral-political” arguments for an Upper House are these. 
 In the first place, “a bicameral sys-tem exists everywhere in Europe, except in Greece, Serbia,Bulgaria, and Luxemburg.... 
” Not everywhere, then, ifthere are exceptions? Besides, what sort of argument isthis: there are a great many anti-democratic bodies in Europe, therefore ... therefore they should be copied by our “pro-foundly democratic” liberals? The second argument: “It isdangerous to concentrate the legislative power in a singlebody”; another body should be set up to rectify mistakesand “too hasty” decisions...; “should Russia be bolder thanEurope?” Thus, Russian liberalism does not want to be bolder than European liberalism, which has knowingly lost its progressive character through fear of the proletar-iat! Fine leaders of the “liberation” movement, indeed!Not a single serious step towards freedom has been made inRussia; yet the liberals already fear “hastiness”. 
 Cannotthe same arguments be used, gentlemen, to justify the renun-ciation of universal suffrage as well? A third argument: “One of the principal dangers to any political system in Russia is that it may be converted intoa regime of Jacobin centralisation. 
” How dreadful! Theliberal opportunists evidently do not mind borrowingammunition against lower-class democracy from the Social-Democratic opportunists, the new-Iskrists. 
 The ridiculous bogy of “Jacobinism” dragged out by Axelrod, Martynov &Co. 
 is doing the Osvobozhdeniye camp a good turn. 
 But, gentle-men, if you really feared the excesses of centralism (andnot the “excesses” of consistent democracy), why should youlimit universal suffrage in elections of the local —Zemstvo and municipal—bodies, as you are doing? Article 68 of your draft stipulates that “every person having the rightto vote in the elections to the House of People’s Represent-atives has equally the right to vote in the local elections,if he has been domiciled in the given uyezd or town for a def-inite period of time , such restricted period not to exceed one year ”. 
 This article introduces a qualification , thereby virtually making the franchise non-universal ; for everyone understands that it is the workers, farm-hands, and day-labourers who are mostly obliged to move from town to town and from district to district without a permanent place of residence. 
 Capital drives masses of workers from one end of the country to the other, giving them no chance to claimpermanent residence; and because of that the working class is to forfeit a part of its political rights! This limitation of universal suffrage is to apply to the very bodies, rural and municipal, that elect the Upper, Zemstvo, House. 
 To combat alleged excesses of Jacobin cen-tralism, a double departure is made from democracy: first, universal suffrage is to be limited by the residence quali-fication; secondly, the principle of direct suffrage is to be annulled by the introduction of two-stage elections! Cananything be clearer than that the bogy of Jacobinism only serves the purpose of every type of opportunists? Small wonder, indeed, that Mr. 
 Struve expressed his sympathy in principle with the Social-DemocraticGirondists—the new-Iskrists, that he sang the praises ofMartynov, the famous champion of anti-”Jacobinism”. 
The Social-Democratic enemies of Jacobinism have paved the way for the liberal bourgeois. 
 The contention of the Osvobozhdeniye crowd that the Upper House, elected by the Zemstvo bodies, can best ex-press “the principle of decentralisation”, the “multiformityof the different parts of Russia”, is sheer nonsense. 
 Decen-tralisation cannot be expressed by limitation of the universal basis of the elections; multiformity cannot be expressed by limitation of the principle of direct elections. 
 This is notthe crux of the matter, which the Osvobozhdeniye people are trying to obscure. 
 The real point is that by their system theUpper House is bound to become pre-eminently and chiefly an organ of the nobility and the bourgeoisie, since it is the proletariat that is largely affected by the residence quali-fication and the two-stage system of elections. 
 The point isso plain to anyone at all familiar with political questionsthat the authors of the draft anticipate this inevitableobjection. 
 “Some people will say,” we read in the explanatory comment, “that no matter how the elections are organised, the big landowners and employer class stand a chance of keeping control in the local community. 
 We think [what a profoundly democratic thought!] that this is just another case of exaggerated fear of the ‘bourgeois element’. 
 There is nothing unfair [!] in the landowning and manufacturing classes obtaining an adequate [!] chance of representingtheir interests [universal suffrage is not enough for thebourgeois element!], so long as other social groups are grant-ed wide opportunities for representation. 
 Only privilegesare morally objectionable and politically dangerous.... 
” Let the workers make a careful note of this “liberal” morality. 
 It presumes to boast of democracy, to condemn“privileges”, while at the same time justifying residence qualification, two-stage elections, and the monarchy.... 
 Themonarchy, evidently, is not a “privilege”, or perhaps it isa morally unobjectionable and politically non-dangerous privilege! Our society leaders of the “liberation” movement have started off well! Even in their most ambitious projects,which do not in the least commit their party as a whole,they devise advance apologies for reaction, defending theprivileges of the bourgeoisie with sophistic attempts to prove that privileges are not privileges. 
 Even in their publishing activities that least depend on material calcula-tions and are least affected by immediate political aims,they contrive to prostitute the idea of democracy andslander the most consistent of all bourgeois democrats—theJacobins of the Great French Revolution. 
 And what are we to expect further? What are the practical politicians of the liberal bourgeoisie, responsible to their party, going to say,if the most idealistic of the liberals are already now pre-paring the theoretical ground for betrayal? If the boldestambitions of the extreme Left Wing of the Osvobozhdeniye camp do not go beyond a monarchy with a bicameral parlia-ment, if that is the only price the ideologues of liberalism demand , then on what terms will liberalism’s businessmen strike a bargain ? The political sophisms of liberalism offer the revolution-ary proletariat slight, yet valuable, documentation as tothe real class nature of even the most advanced elements of the bourgeoisie.

S.

P. 
 was recently held. 
 This Congress should mark a new phase in the history of our Social-Democratic working-class move-ment. 
 Russia is passing through a great historical period. 
Revolution has broken out and its flames are spreading widerand wider, embracing new regions and new sections of thepopulation. 
 The proletariat stands at the head of the fight-ing forces of the revolution. 
 It has already borne the great-est sacrifices in the cause of freedom and is now preparing for the decisive battle with the tsarist autocracy. 
 The class-conscious representatives of the proletariat know thatfreedom will not rid the working people of poverty, oppres-sion, and exploitation. 
 The bourgeoisie, which now standsfor the cause of freedom, will, on the morrow of the revolu-tion, try to deprive the workers of as large a part of its conquests as possible and will show itself to be the impla-cable enemy of the socialist demands of the proletariat. 
But we do not fear a free, united, and strengthened bour-geoisie. 
 We know that freedom will enable us to wage abroad and open mass struggle for socialism. 
 We know that economic development will inexorably sap the power of capital and prepare the victory of socialism, and that itwill do this the more rapidly, the more freely it proceeds. 
 Comrades Workers! To achieve this great aim we must unite all class-conscious proletarians in a single RussianSocial-Democratic Labour Party. 
 Our Party began to con-stitute itself quite some time ago, immediately follow-ing the broad working-class movement of 1895 and 1896. 
The year 1898 saw the convocation of its First Congress, which founded the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party and outlined its aims. 
 The Second Congress was held in 1903. 
 It gave the Party a programme, adopted a series of resolutions on tactics, and endeavoured, for the first time,to build an integral Party organisation. 
 True, the Party didnot at once succeed in this effort. 
 The minority at the Sec-ond Congress refused to submit to the majority and starteda split that has caused great harm to the Social-Democratic working-class movement. 
 The first step towards this split was the refusal to carry out the decisions of the SecondCongress and to accept the leadership of the central bodiesit had set up. 
 The last step was the refusal to participatein the Third Congress. 
 The Third Congress was convened bya Bureau elected by the majority of the committees working in Russia, and by the Central Committee of the Party. 
 All the committees, breakaway groups, and the peripheryorganisations dissatisfied with the committees were invitedto the Congress. 
 The vast majority of these organisations,including nearly all the committees and organisations ofthe Minority, elected delegates and sent them abroad to attend the Congress. 
 Thus everything possible under our police regime was done to convene an all-Party congress;it was only the refusal of three members of the former PartyCouncil resident abroad that resulted in the boycott ofthe Congress by the entire Party Minority. 
 The Third Con-gress, as will be seen from its resolution 132 printed below, lays the entire responsibility for the split in the Party on these three members. 
 Nevertheless, despite the absence ofthe Minority, the Third Congress took every measure toenable the Minority to work with the Majority in one party. 
The Congress held the reversion to the antiquated andsuperseded views of Economism discernible in our Party to be incorrect; at the same time, it provided precise and def-inite guarantees of the rights of every minority, guaranteesembodied in the Rules of the Party and binding on all itsmembers. 
 The Minority now has the unconditional right,guaranteed by the Party Rules, to advocate its views andto carry on an ideological struggle, so long as the disputes and differences do not lead to disorganisation, so long as they do not impede constructive work, split our forces, orhinder the concerted struggle against the autocracy and the Front page of the Bolshevik newspaper Proletary , No.

 The right to publish Party literature is now grant-ed by the Rules to every qualified Party organisation. 
 It has now been made incumbent on the C. 
C. 
 of the Party to transport all kinds of Party literature upon the demand offive qualified committees, or one-sixth of all such commit-tees in the Party. 
 The autonomy of the committees has beendefined more precisely and their membership declared in-violable, which means that the C. 
C. 
 no longer has the right to remove members from local committees or to appoint new members without the consent of the committees themselves. 
This rule admits of only one exception, namely, in caseswhere two-thirds of the organised workers demand the remov-al of a committee; under the Rules adopted by the ThirdCongress such removal is incumbent on the C. 
C. 
 if two-thirds of its members agree with the decision of the workers. 
 Every local committee has been accorded the right to con-firm periphery organisations as Party organisations. 
 Theperiphery organisations have been accorded the right tonominate candidates for committee membership. 
 The bound-aries of the Party have been defined more precisely, in accordance with the wishes of the Party majority. 
 A single centre has been set up instead of two or three. 
 The comradesworking in Russia have been guaranteed a decided prepon-derance over the Party’s section abroad. 
 In a word, theThird Congress has done everything to remove all possibil-ity of charging the Majority with abuse of numerical superiority, with mechanical suppression, with despot-ism of the central bodies of the Party, and so on andso forth. 
 Full opportunity has been provided for allSocial-Democrats to work in co-operation, to join confidentlythe ranks of a single party, broad and virile enough, strongand welded enough to cut loose from the old traditions of the study circle days and to wipe out all traces of past fric-tion and petty conflicts. 
 Let all members of the Social-Democratic Party who really cherish the Party spirit nowrespond to the call of the Third Congress; let its decisionsserve as the starting-point for restoring the unity of the Party,for eliminating all disorganisation, and for consolidating the ranks of the proletariat. 
 We are convinced that the class-conscious workers, who are best able to appreciate the im-portance of united and concerted work, and who have most keenly felt all the harmful effects of discord, vacillation, and strife, will now insist with the utmost vigour on uni-versal and unreserved recognition of Party discipline by all Party members, whether rank and file or leaders. 
 While striving, in all its decisions on organisation and tactics, to maintain continuity with the work of the SecondCongress, the Third Congress sought to take into considera-tion the new tasks of the moment in its resolutions on the Party’s preparation for open action; on the necessity for the Party to participate practically and most energetically inthe armed uprising and to give it leadership; and, finally,on the Party’s attitude towards a provisional revolutionarygovernment. 
 The Congress drew the attention of all Partymembers to the need for taking advantage of all waverings on the part of the government and of every legal or actual extension of freedom for our activities in order to strengthenthe class organisation of the proletariat and to prepare forits open action. 
 But apart from these general and basic tasksof the Social-Democratic working-class party, the presentrevolutionary moment demands of the Party that it assume the role of foremost champion of freedom, of vanguard in the armed uprising against the autocracy. 
 The more stub-bornly the tsarist government resists the people’s strivingstowards freedom, the more powerful will be the force ofthe revolutionary onset and the more likely the completevictory of democracy, headed by the working class. 
 The conduct of a victorious revolution and the defence of its conquests lay tremendous tasks on the shoulders of theproletariat. 
 But the proletariat will not flinch at these greattasks. 
 It will contemptuously brush aside all who predictthat its victory will bring it misfortune. 
 The Russian pro-letariat will be able to do its duty to the very end. 
 It will be capable of taking the lead of the people’s insurrection. 
 It will not be daunted by the difficult task of participating ina provisional revolutionary government, if it has to tacklethis task. 
 It will be able to repel all attempts at counter-revolution, to crush ruthlessly all enemies of freedom, todefend staunchly the democratic republic, and to realise, in a revolutionary way, the whole of our minimum programme. 
 The Russian proletarians should not fear such an outcome,but should passionately desire it. 
 Our victory in the coming democratic revolution will be a giant stride forward towards our socialist goal; we shall deliver all Europe from the oppressive yoke of a reactionary military power and help our brothers, the class-conscious workers of the whole worldwho have suffered so much under the bourgeois reaction andwho are taking heart now at the sight of the successes of therevolution in Russia, to advance to socialism more quickly,boldly, and decisively. 
 With the help of the socialist prole-tariat of Europe, we shall be able, not only to defend the democratic republic, but to advance with giant stridestowards socialism. 
 Forward, then, comrades workers, to the organised, con-certed, and staunch struggle for freedom! Long live the revolution! Long live international revolutionary Social-Democracy! Central Committee, R.

 1, Published according to May 27 (14), 1905 the text in the newspaper Proletary HOW THE CONGRESS WAS CONSTITUTED 133 In supplementation of the resolution adopted at the beginning of the Congress, the Central Committee deems itnecessary, on the basis of subsequent information, to add the following. 
 The Congress set the total number of votes in our Party at 71, namely: 62 from the 31 qualified organisa-tions and 9 from the central bodies. 
 The Congress did notrecognise the Kremenchug, Kazan, and Kuban committeesas qualified Party organisations. 
 The following committeeshad voting delegates at the Congress: St. 
 Petersburg, Mos-cow, Tver (at the conclusion of the Congress), Riga, North-ern, Tula, Nizhni-Novgorod, Ural, Samara, Saratov, theCaucasian League (8 votes, the equivalent of four commit-tees), Voronezh, Nikolayev, Odessa, Polesye, North-West-ern, Kursk, and Orel-Bryansk. 
 Altogether 21 organisationswith 42 votes. 
 In addition there were the C. 
C. 
 delegates and the representatives of the C. 
C. 
 on the Council command-ing four votes. 
 All in all, 46 votes out of 71. 
 Present withconsultative voice were: the delegates from the ArchangelCommittee, the League of the Urals (a second delegate, whoarrived towards the end of the Congress), the Kazan Com-mittee, the Odessa Committee, the Ekaterinoslav, Kharkov, and Minsk groups, the Editorial Board of Vperyod , and the Committee of the Organisation Abroad. 
 The delegate ofthe Kremenchug Committee had expressed a desire to takepart in the Congress proceedings, but he arrived too late. 
Furthermore, the delegates to the Third Congress receiveda document during the proceedings from which it appears that, owing to the efforts of the Organising Committee to convene the all-Party Congress, representatives of the fol-lowing organisations had arrived abroad: the St. 
 Petersburg group of the C. 
C. 
, the Odessa group of the C. 
C. 
, the Niko-layev Committee, the Kharkov Committee, the Kiev Com-mittee, the Ekaterinoslav Committee, the Kuban Commit-tee, the Don Committee, the Donets League, the SiberianLeague, the periphery of the Moscow Committee, the Sor-movo periphery, the Smolensk Committee, the CrimeanLeague, and the Ukrainian Social-Democratic League. 
 Thedocument is a letter to “The comrades assembled in Con-gress at the invitation of the Organising Committee”, signed by the representatives of all the above-mentioned organ-isations. 
 From this it will be seen that the Organising Com-mittee actually succeeded in making possible an all-Partycongress in the full sense of the word. 
 Altogether the Congress held 26 sessions. 
 The following questions of tactics were on the agenda: (1) the armed upris-ing; (2) the attitude towards the government’s policy on theeve of and during the revolution; (3) the position on thepeasant movement. 
 Then questions of organisation: (4) therelations between the workers and the intellectuals withinthe Party organisations; (5) the Party Rules. 
 Further, the questions dealing with our relationship towards other par-ties and organisations, namely: (6) the relationship to thebreakaway section of the Russian Social-Democratic LabourParty, (7) to the non-Russian Social-Democratic parties,(8) to the “Socialists-Revolutionaries”, and (9) to the lib-erals. 
 Further, (10) improvement of propaganda and agi-tation; (11) report of the C. 
C. 
; (12) reports of delegates from the local committees; (13) elections; (14) standing order forpublication of the proceedings and decisions of the Congress,and for the assumption of office by newly elected function-aries. 
 The publication of the proceedings of the Congress has been entrusted to a committee specially elected by the Con-gress. 
 This committee has already commenced its work.

 for the Congress is over at last. 
 The Third Congress has beenheld. 
 A detailed appraisal of all its work will be possible only after the proceedings of the Congress have been pub-lished. 
 At present we propose, on the basis of the published“Report” * and the impressions of the Congress delegates, to touch on the principal landmarks of Party development asreflected in the decisions of the Third Congress. 
 Three major questions confronted the Party of the class-conscious proletariat in Russia on the eve of the Third Con-gress. 
 First, the question of the Party crisis. 
 Second, the moreimportant question of the form of organisation of the Partyin general. 
 Third, the main question, namely, our tacticsin the present revolutionary situation. 
 Let us see how thesequestions were dealt with, in the order of lesser to major. 
 The Party crisis solved itself by the mere fact that the Congress was convened. 
 The root cause of the crisis, as every-one knows, was the stubborn refusal of the minority atthe Second Congress to submit to the majority. 
 The agonis-ing and protracted nature of the crisis was conditioned bythe delay in convening the Third Congress, by the fact that there was virtually a split in the Party, a split that was kept hidden and secret beneath a hypocritical show of uni-ty, while the Majority was making desperate efforts to finda quick and direct way out of the impossible situation. 
 TheCongress provided this way out by bluntly asking theMinority whether it accepted the decisions of the Majority, i. 
e. 
, whether Party unity was to be restored in actual fact *See pp. 
 433-39 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 or to be formally and completely broken. 
 The Minority chose the latter course. 
 It preferred a split. 
 The Council’s refusal to take part in the Congress in face of the clearly expressed will of the majority of qualified Party organisations and therefusal of the entire Minority to attend the Congress repre-sented, as the “Report” states, the final step towards thesplit. 
 We shall not dwell here on the formal validity of theCongress, which has been conclusively evidenced in the “Report”. 
 The argument that the Congress was invalid, that is, not in accordance with the Party Rules, because it hadnot been convened by the Council, can hardly be treatedseriously after all that happened as a result of the Partyconflict. 
 It is clear to anyone who has any idea of the generalprinciples of Party organisation that discipline in regard to a lower body is conditional upon discipline in regard to the higher body; the discipline which the Council may commandis conditional upon the Council’s subordination to its prin-cipals, that is, the committees and their totality, the PartyCongress. 
 To disagree with this elementary principle is tocome to the absurd conclusion that it is not the agents who are responsible and accountable to their principals, but vice versa. 
 But this question, we repeat, is not worth dwell-ing upon, not only because those do not see the point whodo not wish to see it, but because, from the outset of thesplit, the dispute on formalities between the breakawaygroups becomes barren, pointless, and scholastic. 
 The Minority has split away from the Party; that is an accomplished fact. 
 Some of them will probably be broughtto see by the decisions of the Congress, and still more byits proceedings, how naïve the sundry tales about mechanicalsuppression, etc. 
, are; they will come to see that the rightsof the Minority in general are fully guaranteed by the new Rules, that the split is harmful; and this section of the Minor-ity will re-enter the Party. 
 The other section may persistfor a while in refusing to recognise the Party Congress. 
 Asto this section, we can but hope that it will lose no time inorganising itself internally into a separate organisation withits own tactics and its own Rules. 
 The sooner it does this, the easier it will be for all, for the broad mass of the Party workers, to understand the causes of the split and its impli-cations; the more practicable it will be for our Party to come to a working agreement with the breakaway organisation, depending on the needs of local work; and the sooner will a way be found for the inevitable future restoration of the Party’s unity. 
 Let us now pass to the second question, to the general organisational standards of the Party. 
 The Third Congressmade changes of a substantial character in these standards inthe course of revising the Party Rules. 
 The revision affected three main points: (a) the amendment of Clause 1 of the Rules; (b) the precise definition of the rights of the C. 
C. 
and the autonomy of the committees, with the extension ofthe scope of this autonomy; and (c) the creation of a singlecentre. 
 As to the famous Clause 1 of the Rules, this has beensufficiently clarified in Party literature. 
 The erroneousness of defending in principle Martov’s vague formula has been demonstrated conclusively. 
 Kautsky’s attempt to defend thisformula from considerations, not of principle, but of expe-diency, namely, the conditions of secrecy prevailing in Rus-sia, was not successful, as indeed it could not be. 
 Anyonewho has worked in Russia knows well that such considerations of expediency do not exist. 
 The only thing now is to wait for the first results of the Party’s collective work in implementing the new Clause 1 of the Rules. 
 We emphasise the fact thata great deal of work has still to be done for this implementa-tion. 
 No work at all is needed to enrol oneself as a memberof the Party “under the control of a Party organisation”, since this formula is a mere name and remained such from the Second Congress to the Third. 
 A wide network of variedParty organisations, from narrow and secret organisationsto the broadest possible and least secret, can only be builtup by dint of long, hard, and efficient organising work; thisis the work that has now devolved upon our C. 
C. 
 and to a still greater extent upon our local committees. 
 It is the committees that will have to confirm the largest number oforganisations in the capacity of Party branches and in thecourse avoid all unnecessary red tape and faultfinding;it is the committees that will have to propagate among theworkers constantly and unremittingly the idea of the neces-sity to create the greatest possible number of diverse work-ers organisations affiliated to our Party. 
 We cannot dealhere with this interesting question at greater length. 
 We should like to point out, however, that the revolutionary epoch makes it particularly essential to draw a line of de-marcation between Social-Democracy and all the other dem-ocratic parties. 
 But this demarcation is unthinkable un-less sustained efforts are made to increase the number ofParty organisations and strengthen the ties among them. 
The fortnightly reports decided upon by the Congress will,among other things, serve to strengthen these ties. 
 Let us hope that the reports will not remain an unrealised wish; that they will not cause the practical workers to draw forthemselves a horrible picture of red tape and bureaucracy;that these comrades will start off in a small way till they de-velop the habit, by perhaps just reporting the number ofmembers of every Party organisation, even the smallest and the farthest from the centre. 
 “The first step is the hard-est”, runs the proverb. 
 After that they will realise how tre-mendously important it is to acquire the habit of maintain-ing regular organisational connections. 
 We shall not dwell at length on the question of the single centre. 
 The Third Congress rejected “bicentrism” by as huge a majority as the Second Congress had adopted it. 
 The reasons will easily be understood by anyone who has care-fully followed the history of the Party. 
 Congresses do notso much create something new as consolidate results alreadyachieved. 
 At the time of the Second Congress the Iskra Editorial Board was the recognised pillar of stability, and it enjoyed dominant influence. 
 The preponderant position of the comrades in Russia in relation to those resident abroadstill seemed problematical at that stage of the Party’s devel-opment. 
 After the Second Congress it was the EditorialBoard abroad that proved to be unstable. 
 The Party, on theother hand, had developed considerably and unquestionably in Russia. 
 Under these circumstances the appointment of an Editorial Board of the Central Organ by the Party C. 
C. 
could not but meet with the approval of the mass of theParty workers. 
 Finally, the attempts to delimit more precisely the rights of the C. 
C. 
 and of the local committees, to draw a line be-tween ideological struggle and disruptive squabbles, fol-lowed inevitably also from the whole course of events afterthe Second Congress. 
 We have here a consistent and system-atic “accumulation of Party experience”. 
 Plekhanov’s and Lenin’s letter of October 6, 1903, * to the disgruntled editors was an attempt to distinguish between irritation and dis-agreement. 
 The C. 
C. 
’s ultimatum of November 25, 1903, was a similar attempt in the form of a proposal formulat-ed by a group of publicists. 
 The statement issued by the C. 
C. 
 representatives on the Council at the end of January 1903 ** was an attempt to call upon the whole Party to dif-ferentiate the ideological forms of struggle from boycott,etc. 
 Lenin’s letter of May 26, 1904, *** to the members of the C. 
C. 
 in Russia was an admission of the necessity of for-mally guaranteeing the rights of the Minority. 
 The well-known Declaration of the Twenty-Two (autumn 1904) was a similar admission in a more distinct, detailed, and categorical form. 
 Quite naturally, the Third Congress took the same path when it “finally dispelled, dispelled by for-mal decisions, the mirage of a state of siege”. 
 What these formal decisions were, viz. 
, the changes in the Party Rules, can be seen from the Rules and the “Report”; therefore we shall not repeat them here. 
 We shall mention only two things. 
 First, it is to be hoped that the guarantee of the right topublish literature and the safeguarding of the committees against “cashiering” will help the seceded non-Russian Social-Democratic organisations to return to the Party. 
 Sec-ondly, in view of the inviolability of committee membership, some provision had to be made against the possible abuse of this guarantee, viz. 
, against being saddled with a perfectly useless committee that was “undeposable”. 
 That accounts for Clause 9 of the new Party Rules, which sets forth the con-ditions under which a committee may be dissolved upon the demand of two-thirds of the local workers belonging to the Party organisations. 
 Let us wait for the guidance of experi-ence before deciding to what extent this rule is practical. 
 Finally, in passing to the last and most important item of the Congress proceedings, the determination of the Party’s tactics, we must state that this is not the place to list and analyse the various resolutions. 
 Possibly we shall have to do ******See present edition, Vol.

 this in special articles devoted to the major resolutions. 
 Here we need only outline the general political situation which the Congress had to analyse. 
 Two alternative courses and outcomes are open to the Russian revolution, which has begun. 
 The tsarist government may yet succeed by means of trivial concessions and a “Shipov” constitution in extri-cating itself from the vice in which it is now caught. 
 There is little likelihood of such an outcome; but should the inter-national position of the autocracy improve as the result, let us say, of a relatively favourable peace, should the betrayal by the bourgeoisie of the cause of freedom be brought quickly to a head by a compromise with the powers that be, should the inevitable revolutionary outbreak or out-breaks end in the defeat of the people, then such an outcome is likely. 
 We Social-Democrats and the entire class-conscious proletariat must then face a long dreary period of harsh, ostensibly constitutional class rule of the bourgeoisie, with all manner of suppression of the political activity of the workers and slow economic progress under the new conditions. 
 We shall not lose heart, of course, whatever the outcome of the revolution; we will take advantage of everychange in conditions to widen and strengthen the independ-ent organisation of the working-class party, to train the proletariat politically for renewed struggle. 
 The Congress took this task, among others, into account in its resolu-tion on open action by the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 The other possible and more probable outcome of the rev-olution is the “complete victory of democracy, headed by the working class”, of which the “Report” speaks. 
 * W e need hardly say that we will do all in our power to achieve this result, to eliminate the possibility of the other alter-native. 
 The objective historical conditions, too, are shaping themselves favourably for the Russian revolution. 
 The sense-less and shameful war is tightening the noose round the neck of the tsarist government and creating an exceptionally favourable situation for the revolutionary destruction of militarism, for the widespread propaganda of the idea of arming the people in lieu of standing armies and for the speedy *See p. 
 438 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 effectuation of this measure, in view of its support by the masses of the population. 
 The long and undivided rule of the autocracy has stored up revolutionary energy among the people to a degree perhaps never before known in history. 
Simultaneously with the vast movement of the working class,the peasant revolt is spreading and growing, and the petty-bourgeois democratic forces, consisting mostly of the profes-sional classes, are coming into alliance. 
 The irony of history has punished the autocracy in that even friendly social forces, such as clericalism, must organise against it to some extent,thereby breaking down or widening the framework of thebureaucratic police regime. 
 Discontent among the clergy, thestriving among them after new forms of life, the emergence ofclericals as a separate group, the appearance of Christian Socialists and Christian Democrats, the resentment of the “heterodox”, sectarians, etc. 
—this all serves the purpose ofthe revolution and creates exceedingly favourable conditionsfor agitation for the complete separation of the Church fromthe State. 
 The allies of the revolution, voluntary and invol-untary, conscious and unconscious, are growing and multip-lying hour by hour. 
 The outlook brightens for the victory of the people over the autocracy. 
 This victory is possible only through a heroic effort of all the forces of the proletariat. 
 It makes demands ofSocial-Democracy such as history has never before and no-where made of a working-class party in an epoch of democratic revolution. 
 We have before us now, not the well-trodden paths of slow preparatory work, but the colossal, grandiose tasks oforganising the insurrection, mustering the revolutionaryforces of the proletariat, uniting them with the forces of thewhole revolutionary people, launching the armed attack, andestablishing a provisional revolutionary government. 
 In the resolutions which have now been published for general information, the Third Congress has sought to take intoaccount these new tasks and give all possible directives tothe organisations of the class-conscious proletariat. 
 Russia is nearing the denouement of the age-long struggle of all the progressive popular forces against the autocracy. 
 No one doubts any longer that the proletariat will take the most energetic part in this struggle and that its participationin the struggle will decide the outcome of the revolution in Russia. 
 We Social-Democrats will now have to prove ourselves worthy representatives and leaders of the most revolutionary class, to help it win the fullest freedom, which is, the pledge of our victorious march towards socialism. 
 Proletary , No. 
 1, Published according to May 27 (14), 1905 the text in Proletary VICTORIOUS REVOLUTION We often hear and read these words nowadays. 
 What do they actually mean? We should not idolise the conceptof “revolution” (the bourgeois revolutionaries will assuredly do that and are indeed doing that). 
 We must not create illusions or myths for ourselves; this would be entirelyincompatible with the materialist conception of historyand the class point of view. 
 Yet there is no question that a struggle of two forces is taking place before our eyes, a life-and-death struggle of precisely two forces; for the issue at stake now is the sover-eignty of the tsar versus the sovereignty of the people. 
 Thesetwo forces are: revolution and counter-revolution. 
 Our task, therefore, is to be quite clear in our minds as to (1) the class content of these social forces, and (2) the realeconomic content of their struggle now, at the present time. 
 The following may be taken as a brief answer to these questions (an answer that requires to be thoroughly elabo-rated): Revolutionary forces =proletariat and peasantry (the peasantry as the chief representative of the revolutionary petty bourgeoisie; the intelligentsia negligible as a rev-olutionary factor). 
 Victorious revolution =democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry. 
 Content of the revolution =the creation of a democratic political system, economically equivalent to (1) free de-velopment of capitalism; (2) abolition of the survivals of serfdom; (3) the raising of the living and cultural standards of the masses, especially of the lower strata.

 ON CONFOUNDING POLITICS WITH PEDAGOGICS We have quite a few Social-Democrats who give way to pessimism every time the workers suffer a reverse in singlebattles with the capitalists or with the government, and who scornfully dismiss all mention of the great and lofty aims of the working-class movement by pointing to the in-adequate degree of our influence on the masses. 
 Who and whatare we, they say, to strive towards such things? It is pur-poseless to speak of the role of Social-Democracy as van-guard of the revolution when we do not even really know the mood of the masses, when we are unable to merge with them and to rouse the working masses! The reverses sufferedby the Social-Democrats last May Day have considerablyintensified this mood. 
 Naturally, the Mensheviks, or new-Iskrists, have seized this opening to raise anew the specialslogan “To the masses!”—as if in spite, as if in answer to those who have thought and spoken of the provisional revo-lutionary government, of the revolutionary-democraticdictatorship, etc. 
 It must be admitted that in this pessimism, and in the conclusions which the hasty publicists of the new Iskra draw from it, there is one very dangerous feature that may cause great harm to the Social-Democratic movement. 
 To be sure, self-criticism is vitally essential to every live and virileparty. 
 There is nothing more disgusting than smug optimism. 
There is nothing more warranted than the urging of attentionto the constant, imperative necessity of deepening andbroadening, broadening and deepening, our influence on the masses, our strictly Marxist propaganda and agitation, our ever-closer connection with the economic struggle of theworking class, etc. 
 Yet, because such urging is at all times warranted, under all conditions and in all situations, it must not be turned into special slogans, nor should it justify attempts to build upon it a special trend in Social-Democracy. 
 A border-line exists here; to exceed the boundsis to turn this indisputably legitimate urging into a narrow-ing of the aims and the scope of the movement, into a doctri-naire blindness to the vital and cardinal political tasks ofthe moment. 
 It is our duty always to intensify and broaden our work and influence among the masses. 
 A Social-Democrat who doesnot do this is no Social-Democrat. 
 No branch, group, orcircle can be considered a Social-Democratic organisationif it does not work to this end steadily and regularly. 
 Toa great extent, the purpose of our strict separation as a distinct and independent party of the proletariat consists in the fact that we always and undeviatingly conduct thisMarxist work of raising the whole working class, as far aspossible, to the level of Social-Democratic consciousness,allowing no political gales, still less political changesof scenery, to turn us away from this urgent task. 
 Without this work, political activity would inevitably degenerate into a game, because this activity acquires real importancefor the proletariat only when and insofar as it arouses the massof a definite class, wins its interest, and mobilises it totake an active, foremost part in events. 
 This work, as we havesaid, is always necessary. 
 After every reverse we should bring this to mind again, and emphasise it, for weakness in this work is always one of the causes of the proletariat’s defeat. 
 Similarly, we should always call attention to it andemphasise its importance after every victory, otherwisethe victory will be only a seeming one, its fruits will not beassured, its real significance in the great struggle for our ultimate goal will be negligible and may even prove adverse (particularly if a partial victory should slacken our vigi-lance, lull our distrust of unreliable allies, and cause us toforgo the right moment for a renewed and more vigorousattack on the enemy). 
 But for the very reason that the work of intensifying and broadening our influence on the masses is always necessary, after each victory as after each defeat, in times of politicalquiescence as in the stormiest periods of revolution, we should /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR not turn the emphasis upon this work into a special slogan or build upon it any special trend if we do not wish to court the risk of descending to demagogy and degrading the aims of the advanced and only truly revolutionary class. 
 Thereis and always will be an element of pedagogics in the polit-ical activity of the Social-Democratic Party. 
 We must edu-cate the whole class of wage-workers to the role of fightersfor the emancipation of mankind from all oppression. 
 We must constantly teach more and more sections of this class; we must learn to approach the most backward, the mostundeveloped members of this class, those who are leastinfluenced by our science and the science of life, so as to beable to speak to them, to draw closer to them, to raise themsteadily and patiently to the level of Social-Democratic consciousness, without making a dry dogma out of our doctrine—to teach them not only from books, but throughparticipation in the daily struggle for existence of thesebackward and undeveloped strata of the proletariat. 
 Thereis, we repeat, a certain element of pedagogics in this everydayactivity. 
 The Social-Democrat who lost sight of this activity would cease to be a Social-Democrat. 
 That is true. 
 But some of us often forget, these days, that a Social-Democrat whowould reduce the tasks of politics to pedagogics would also,though for a different reason, cease to be a Social-Democrat. 
Whosoever might think of turning this “pedagogics” intoa special slogan, of contraposing it to “politics”, of building a special trend upon it, and of appealing to the masses under this slogan against the “politicians” of Social-Democracy,would instantly and unavoidably descend to demagogy. 
 That comparisons are odious is an old axiom. 
 In every comparison a likeness is drawn in regard to only one aspector several aspects of the objects or notions compared, while the other aspects are tentatively and with reservation abstracted. 
 Let us remind the reader of this commonlyknown but frequently ignored axiom and proceed to comparethe Social-Democratic Party to a large school which is atonce elementary, secondary, and collegiate. 
 The teachingof the ABC, instruction in the rudiments of knowledge and in independent thinking, will never, under any circumstances, be neglected in this big school. 
 But if anyone soughtto invoke the need for teaching the ABC as a pretext for dis-missing questions of higher learning, if anyone attempted to offset the impermanent, dubious, and “narrow” results of this higher learning (accessible to a much smaller circle of people than those learning the ABC) to the durable, pro-found, extensive, and solid results of the elementary school,he would betray incredible short-sightedness. 
 He might evenhelp to pervert the whole purpose of the big school, sinceby ignoring higher education he would simply be making it easier for charlatans, demagogues, and reactionaries to mis-lead the people who had only learned the ABC. 
 Or again, letus compare the Party to an army. 
 Neither in peace-time norin war-time dare we neglect the training of recruits, darewe neglect rifle drill, or the dissemination of the rudimentsof military science as intensively and extensively as possible among the masses. 
 But if those directing the manoeuvres or actual battles....

 A LETTER TO THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIALIST BUREAU Geneva, June 2, 1905 To the International Socialist Bureau Dear Comrades, A few weeks ago the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party held its Third Congress. 
 French and German transla-tions of the Congress resolutions will appear shortly in a special pamphlet, 136 which will be forwarded to the Bureau. 
 By decision of the Congress, Iskra has ceased to be the Central Organ of the Party. 
 Henceforth, the weekly,Proletary 137 published in Geneva, will be the Central Organ. 
 The Central Committee, which is, according to the new Rules, the sole central body of our Party, will appoint the Party’s representative on the International Bureau. 
 Please address all future communications to Comrade Ulyanov,Representative of the Central Committee, 3, Rue de laColline, Genève. 
 Accept, dear comrades, our fraternal greetings.

 Lenin (V. 
 Ulyanov ) Published in 1905 Published according to as a hectographed leaflet the text of the hectographed leaflet THE ADVICE OF THE CONSERVATIVE BOURGEOISIE The Second Congress of the Zemstvo representatives was held in Moscow a few weeks ago. 
 Russian newspapers arenot allowed to print a word about it. 
 The English newspa-pers report numerous details received from eyewitnesses who attended the Congress and who telegraphed, not onlyits decisions, but the substance of the speeches made by therepresentatives of the various shadings. 
 The decisions of the132 Zemstvo representatives amount in their essence to anacceptance of the constitutional programme published by Mr. 
 Struve and analysed by us in Vperyod , No. 
 18 (“Political Sophisms”). 
 * This programme provides for a bicameral popular legislature and the retention of the monarchy. 
 TheUpper House is to consist of deputies from the Zemstvos andthe municipal councils, the Lower is to be elected on the basisof universal, direct, and equal suffrage by secret ballot. 
 Our legal newspapers, forced to keep silent about the Con-gress, have begun to publish details of the programme,which makes it all the more important now to analyse it. 
 As regards the Congress, we shall probably have occasion more than once to return to it. 
 For the time being we shallrecount, on the authority of the English newspapers, a par-ticularly interesting event at this Congress, namely, the disagreement, or split, between the “liberal”, or opportunistor Shipov, party and the “radical” party. 
 The disagreementarose over the question of universal suffrage, to which theformer party is opposed. 
 On Sunday, May 7 (April 24), ittranspired that 52 members of the Congress backed Shipov and were ready to walk out if the Congress declared for *See pp. 
 425-32 of this volume.

 universal suffrage. 
 On Monday a score among them voted with the majority for universal suffrage. 
 Thereupon a reso-lution on the convocation of a Constituent Assembly on the basis of universal suffrage was adopted unanimously, aconsiderable majority declaring for direct elections and forthe non-admission (to the Constituent Assembly) of repre-sentatives of the municipal councils and Zemstvos. 
 Thus,for the time being , the followers of Shipov have been defeated at the Congress of the Zemstvo representatives. 
 The majority has come to the conclusion that the only way to preservethe monarchy and prevent revolution is to grant universal,direct, and equal suffrage by secret ballot, renderedinnocuous through indirect and unequal elections to oneof the two houses. 
 The opinion of the English conservative bourgeoisie on this Congress and on this decision is most instructive. 
 “Itis quite impossible,” writes The Times , “for foreigners to gauge the political importance of this remarkable meetinguntil we learn from trustworthy authority what measure ofsupport it commands amongst the huge mass of the Russian people. 
 It may mark the beginning of a real constitutional reform; it may be the first stage on the road to revolution;it may be a mere fire of straw which the bureaucracy havetolerated because they know it will burn harmlessly out. 
” A remarkably true characterisation! Indeed, the further course of the Russian revolution is far from being determined by an event like this Congress. 
 “The support of the huge mass of the people” is still a moot question, not as regards theactual fact of the people’s support (which is assured), butrather as regards the strength of this support. 
 If the govern-ment puts down the uprising, then the liberal Congress willindeed have been a fire of straw. 
 And the moderate Euro-pean liberals, of course, advise the golden mean: a moderate constitution which would stave off the revolution. 
 Thegovernment’s confusion, however, fills them with dismayand discontent. 
 The ban on publishing the decisions of theCongress puzzles The Times , since the delegates, now dis-persed to their home districts, have every means of informing the entire Russian public of their decisions. 
 “To have re-fused to allow the Congress to meet, to have arrested its mem-bers when they did meet, or to have used them as a screen for a sham reform would all have been intelligible courses. 
 But to let them meet and disperse, and then to try and silence them is merely inept. 
” The stupidity of the tsarist government, as proved by its confusion and impotence (for confusion at a revolutionarymoment is a sure sign of impotence), fills European capitalwith grave concern ( The Times is a mouthpiece of “the City”, the high financiers of the world’s richest city). 
 This confusion increases the probability of a real, victorious rev-olution sweeping everything in its path, a revolution thatstrikes terror into the hearts of the European bourgeoisie. 
The latter blames the autocracy for losing its head and theliberals for making “immoderate” demands! Upon the ques-tion (universal suffrage) “which the ... most experienced Legislatures in Europe would hesitate to decide in the course of a prolonged session [fumes The Times ]—they seem to have practically reversed their attitude in five short days”and adopted extremist decisions. 
 European capital advisesRussian capital to follow its example. 
 We do not doubt thatthis advice will be taken—but hardly before the autocracy has had its power curtailed . 
 The European bourgeoisie in its day fought against absolutism still more “immoderately”,by still more revolutionary methods than the Russian bour-geoisie does in its day. 
 The “obduracy” of the-Russian autoc-racy and the immoderacy of Russian liberalism are due, notto their inexperience, as The Times seems to imply, but to factors beyond their control—the international situation, foreign policy, and most of all to that heritage of Russianhistory which has driven the autocracy to the wall and piledup under its dominance contradictions and conflicts neverknown in Western Europe. 
 The proverbial stability andstrength of Russian tsarism in the past necessarily condition the force of the revolutionary assault upon it. 
 This is most unpleasant to all gradualists and opportunists; it terrifieseven many Social-Democrats from the tail-ender camp, butsuch is the fact. 
 The Times deplores the defeat of Shipov. 
 Why, only last November he was the undisputed chief of the reform party and now ... “so rapidly does revolution devour its children”. 
 Poor Shipov! To suffer defeat and be branded as the evilgenius of the revolution—could fate be more unjust? The “radicals” who voted Shipov down at the Congress of the Zemstvo representatives shock The Times , which cries in horror that they adhere to the theoretical principles of the French Convention. 
 The doctrine of equality, of equalrights for all citizens, of the sovereignty of the people, etc. 
,“has been proved by many ... experiments to be, perhaps, themost prolific of evil amongst all the brood of disastroussophistries which Jean Jacques Rousseau bequeathed to mankind. 
 It is the tap-root of Jacobinism, fatal by its mere presence to the growth of just and wholesome reforms. 
” The opportunists of liberalism touchingly embrace with the opportunists of Social-Democracy in their partialityfor employing the bogy of “Jacobinism”. 
 In an epoch ofdemocratic revolution only hopeless reactionaries or hope-less philistines can raise the bogy of Jacobinism.

 2 and 3 A R T I C L E O N E PLEKHANOV’S REFERENCE TO HISTORY The Third Congress of the Party adopted a resolution on the question of the provisional revolutionary government. 
 The resolution expresses the position we have taken inVperyod . 
 We now propose to examine in detail all objections to our position and to clarify from all points of considerationthe true doctrinal significance and the practical implicationsof the Congress resolution. 
 We shall begin with Plekhanov’s attempt to deal with the question strictly as a point of prin-ciple. 
 Plekhanov entitled his article “On the Question of theSeizure of Power”. 
 He criticises the “tactics aimed [evidentlyby Vperyod ] at the seizure of political power by the proletar-iat”. 
 As everyone who knows Vperyod is perfectly well aware, it has never raised the question of the seizure of power nor ever aimed at any “tactics of seizure”. 
 Plekhanov seeks to substitute a fictitious issue for the real issue. 
 We have onlyto recollect the course of the controversy to see this. 
 The question was first raised by Martynov in his famous Two Dictatorships . 
 He stated that if our Party took the lead in the uprising and the uprising were successful, this would inevitably bring about our participation in the provisional revolutionary government, which participation was inad-missible in principle and could only lead to disaster anddiscredit. 
 Iskra defended this view. 
 Vperyod contended that, on the contrary, such an outcome was highly desirable,that Social-Democratic participation in a provisional revolutionary government, which would be tantamount to the democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peas-antry, was permissible, and that without such a dictatorshipthe republic could not be maintained. 
 Thus, in answering the question posed by Martynov , both camps to the dispute proceeded from two like premises but reached different con-clusions. 
 Both assumed: 1) that the party of the proletariat would take the lead in the uprising, and 2) that the uprisingwould be victorious and the autocracy completelyoverthrown; they differed in the evaluation of the tacticalconclusions to be drawn from these premises. 
 Does this bearany resemblance to “tactics aimed [!] at the seizure [?] of power”? Is it not obvious that Plekhanov seeks to evade Martynov’s presentation of the question discussed by Iskra and Vperyod ? At issue was the question whether a victorious uprising would be dangerous or disastrous, since it mightnecessitate participation in a provisional revolutionarygovernment. 
 The point that Plekhanov wants to argue is whether the tactics should be aimed at seizure of power. 
 We are afraid that Plekhanov’s wish (which can only beunderstood as a desire to obscure Martynov’s presentation ofthe question) will remain a pious wish, since this is a subjectthat no one has discussed or is arguing. 
 What this substitution of the question signifies for the whole of Plekhanov’s argumentation is clearly revealed in the “virtuosi-of-philistinism” incident. 
 Plekhanov cannotget over this expression, which was used by Vperyod . 
 He reverts to it time and again, sternly and angrily assuring hisreaders that Vperyod has dared to apply this none too flat-tering epithet to Marx and Engels, that Vperyod was begin-ning to “ criticise ” Marx, etc. 
, etc. 
 Seeing that Plekhanov’s aim was to rehabilitate Martynov and to give Vperyod a “dressing down”, we quite understand how pleased he wouldhave been had Vperyod said anything like the nonsense he attributes to it. 
 The point is that “ Vperyod ” did not say anything of the kind , and any attentive reader could easily challenge Plekhanov, who has confused an interesting question of principle by meaningless and paltry cavil. 
 Tedious though it is to answer cavils, the notorious “vir-tuosi-of-philistinism” incident will have to be explained atlength. 
 Vperyod reasoned as follows. 
 We all talk of achieving the republic. 
 To achieve it in reality, we must “strike togeth-er” at the autocracy—“we” being the revolutionary people, the proletariat and the peasantry. 
 But that is not all. 
 Itis not enough even to “strike the finishing blow together” at the autocracy, that is, completely to overthrow the au-tocratic government. 
 We shall also have to “repulse together” the inevitable desperate attempts to restore the deposed au-tocracy. 
 In a revolutionary epoch this “repulsing together” is,in effect, the revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of theproletariat and the peasantry, the participation of the pro-letariat in the revolutionary government. 
 Therefore, theywho seek to frighten the working class with the perspective of such a dictatorship, as people like Martynov and L. 
 Martov have done in the new Iskra , contradict their own slogan of struggling for the republic and consummating the revolu-tion. 
 At bottom, these people reason as if they wanted torestrict, to prune down their struggle for freedom—in aword, to measure off in advance the tiniest of modest gains, some sort of skimpy constitution in place of the republic. 
 Such people, said Vperyod , vulgarise, philistine fashion, the well-known Marxist thesis concerning the three major forcesof the revolution in the nineteenth (and the twentieth)century and its three main stages. 
 The gist of this thesis isthat the first stage of revolution is the restriction of absolut-ism, which satisfies the bourgeoisie; the second is the attain-ment of the republic, which satisfies the “people”—thepeasantry and the petty bourgeoisie at large; the third is thesocialist revolution, which alone can satisfy the proletariat. 
“That picture , by and large , is correct ”, Vperyod said. 
 We actually have here an ascent by three different schematic stages, varying according to the classes, which, at best, will accompany us in this ascent. 
 But if we interpret this correctMarxist scheme of three stages to mean that we must measureoff in advance, before any ascent begins , a very modest part, let us say, not more than one step, if, in keeping with thisscheme and before any ascent begins, we sought to “ draw up a plan of action in the revolutionary epoch ”, we should be virtuosi of philistinism. 
 This was Vperyod ’s line of thought in issue No. 
 14. 
 * And it was on the concluding italicised words that Plekhanovdecided to pick. 
 Vperyod , he triumphantly declared, thereby dubs Marx a philistine, because it was in keeping with *See p. 
 299 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 this scheme that Marx drew up his plan of activity in the revolutionary epoch itself! The evidence? The evidence is that in 1850, when the rev-olutionary people of Germany was defeated in the struggleof 1848-49 because it failed to deal the autocracy the fin-ishing blow, when the liberal bourgeoisie had secured askimpy constitution and passed over to the side of reaction—in a word, when the German democratic-revolutionary move-ment had only ascended the first step and halted for want of strength to mount higher, ... then Marx said that thenext revolutionary ascent would be an ascent to the secondstep. 
 You smile, dear reader? Plekhanov’s syllogism is in fact somewhat—shall we say, to put it mildly—“dialectic”. 
 Because Marx, in the corresponding concrete situation of a concrete democratic revolution, said that the ascent tothe first step would be followed by the ascent to the second,therefore only “critics” of Marx could apply the word philistines to people who, before the first step is ascended, tryto scare us with the awful perspective (in the event of an exceptionally well organised and accomplished uprising) of having to leap two steps at once. 
 No, indeed, it is not a nice thing to “criticise” Marx ... but neither is it nice to cite Marx maladroitly. 
 Martynovwas unfortunate in interpreting Marx; Plekhanov was unfor-tunate in defending Martynov. 
 Let no hypercritical reader infer from what we have said that we advocate “tactics aimed” at unconditionallyleaping over one step, regardless of the correlation of thesocial forces. 
 No, we advocate no such tactics. 
 We only seekto prevent the proletariat from coming under the influenceof people capable of talking of the republic and of carrying through the revolution while at the same time frightening themselves and others with the possibility of having toparticipate in a democratic dictatorship. 
 We pointed outin Vperyod , No. 
 14, that after the present revolutionary upsurge, reaction would inevitably set in, but that the morefreedom we win now and the more ruthlessly we suppress and destroy the counter-revolutionary forces in the epoch of the possible (and desirable) democratic dictatorship, the lesswill reaction be able to take away from us. 
 We also pointed out in the same issue that the very question of this dictatorship makes no sense unless one assumes a course of events in which the democratic revolution goes to the length of completely overthrowing absolutism and establishingthe republic without stopping midway. 
 Let us now pass from the “virtuosi-of-philistinism” inci-dent to the substance of the famous Address (of the CentralCommittee of the Communist League to the League members, March 1850) which Plekhanov cites. 
 In this extremely inter-esting and informative Address (deserving to be translatedfully into Russian) Marx deals with the concrete politicalsituation in Germany in 1850. 
 He indicates the likelihoodof another political outbreak, establishes the inevitabilityof the transition of power to the republican, petty-bourgeois democratic party in the event of a revolution, and analyses the tactics of the proletariat. 
 Dealing with the tactics beforeand during the revolution, and following the victory of thepetty-bourgeois democrats, Marx urges the necessity of creat-ing “an independent secret and open organisation of theworkers’ party”; he struggles with might and main against “its reduction to the role of appendage of the official bour-geois-democratic party”; and he stresses the importance ofarming the workers, of forming an independent proletarianguard, and of having the proletarians keep a close watchon the treacherous petty-bourgeois democracy, etc. 
 There is not a word in the Address on the participation of the workers’ party in a provisional revolutionary govern-ment, or on the revolutionary-democratic dictatorship ofthe proletariat and the peasantry. 
 From that Plekhanovinfers that Marx “apparently regarded as inconceivable theidea that the political representatives of the revolutionaryproletariat could work together with those of the petty bour-geoisie to create a new social order”. 
 The logic of this deduc-tion limps. 
 Marx does not raise the question of the partic-ipation of the workers’ party in a provisional revolutionarygovernment, but Plekhanov concludes that Marx decidesthis question generally and in principle in a definitelynegative sense. 
 Marx speaks only of the concrete situation; Plekhanov draws a general conclusion without at all considering the question in its concreteness. 
 Yet one hasonly to scan some passages in the Address which Plekhanov has omitted to see that his conclusions are entirely false. 
 The Address was written from the experience of two years in a revolutionary epoch, 1848 and 1849. 
 Marx formulatesthe results of this experience as follows: “At the same time[i. 
e. 
, in 1848-49] the former firm organisation of theLeague was considerably slackened. 
 A large part of the mem-bers who directly participated in the revolutionary move-ment believed the time for secret societies to have gone by and public activities alone sufficient. 
 The individual dis-tricts and communities [ Gemeinden ] allowed their connections with the Central Committee to become loose and graduallydormant. 
 Consequently , while the democratic party , the party of the petty bourgeoisie , organised itself more and more in Germany , the workers ’ party lost its only firm hold , remained organised at the most in separate localities forlocal purposes, and in the general movement thus came complete-ly under the domination and leadership of the petty-bour-geois democrats . 
” * On the following page of the Address Marx declares: “At this moment, when a new revolution is imminent ... it is extremely important that the workers’ party ... act in the most organised, most unanimous, andmost independent fashion possible, if it is not to be exploit-ed and taken in tow again by the bourgeoisie as it was in1848. 
” Consider the meaning of these categorical statements! After two years of open revolution, after the victory of the popular uprising in Berlin, after the convocation of a revo-lutionary parliament, after part of the country had been inopen revolt and the power had passed temporarily into thehands of the revolutionary governments, Marx records thedefeat of the revolutionary people, and as regards party organisation, a gain for the petty-bourgeois democrats and a loss for the workers’ party. 
 Is it not as plain as plain canbe that this implies a political situation in which it would *Ansprache der Zentralbehörde an den Bund , von März 1850 , K.

 have been pointless to raise the question of the participation of the workers’ party in the government? After two years of a revolutionary epoch, when Marx, for nine months, had openly published the most revolutionary newspaper of theworkers’ party, it had to be recorded that the party wascompletely disorganised, that there was no clearly markedproletarian current in the mainstream (Stephan Born’s 138 Workers’ Brotherhoods were too negligible), and that the pro-letariat had fallen completely, not only under the domination of the bourgeoisie, but under its leadership! Obviously,economic relations were still extremely undeveloped,there was practically no large-scale industry, nor was therean independent workers’ movement of any appreciable size,and the petty bourgeoisie was in complete control. 
 Naturally, under such circumstances, the idea of participation by the workers’ party in a provisional government could never beentertained by a writer who was dealing with the concretesituation. 
 Naturally, in his Address, Marx had to knock(pardon the expression) into the heads of the CommunistLeague members axioms, which today seem elementary to us. 
 He had to demonstrate the need for workers to nomi-nate their own candidates in elections independently of thebourgeois democrats. 
 He had to refute the democratic phrase-mongering to the effect that the workers’ separationwould “split” the democratic party (mark well!—you canonly split what was yesterday united and what in the ideological sense is still united). 
 Marx had to warn the members of the Communist League not to be carried awayby such phrases. 
 On behalf of the Central Committee of theLeague, he had to promise to convene a congress of theworkers’ party at the first opportunity with the object ofcentralising the workers’ clubs; in the revolutionary years of 1848-49 the conditions were still lacking for anyone to entertain the idea of convening a separate congress of theworkers’ party. 
 The conclusion is obvious: Marx, in the famous Address, does not even mention the question whether it is admissiblein principle for the proletariat to participate in a provisional revolutionary government. 
 He deals exclusively with the concrete situation that prevailed in Germany in 1850. 
 He doesnot say a word about the participation of the Communist League in a revolutionary government, because, under the conditions then prevailing, the idea of such participa-tion in the name of the workers’ party for the purpose of the democratic dictatorship could not have arisen. 
 Marx’s idea consists in the following: We, the German Social-Democrats of 1850, are unorganised, we were defeatedin the first period of the revolution and were takencompletely in tow by the bourgeoisie; we must organise independently—absolutely and under all circumstances independently—if we do not-wish to be caught lagging againin an eventual victory of the organisationally strengthenedand powerful petty-bourgeois party. 
 Martynov’s idea consists in the following: We, the Rus-sian Social-Democrats of 1905, are organised in an independ-ent party and we want to march at the head of the petty-bourgeois people for the first assault on the fortress oftsarism. 
 But if we organise the assault too efficiently andcarry it through successfully—which heaven forfend!—wemay have to participate in a provisional revolutionarygovernment, or even in the democratic dictatorship. 
 Such participation is inadmissible in principle. 
 Does Plekhanov seriously want to convince us that Mar-tynov can be defended according to Marx? Plekhanov musttake the readers of Iskra for children. 
 All we can say is: Marxism is one thing; Martynovism, another. 
 Before concluding with the Address we must clarify an-other incorrect view of Plekhanov. 
 He rightly points out thatin March 1850, when the Address was written, Marx believedthat capitalism was in a state of senile decay and thesocialist revolution seemed to him “quite near”. 
 Shortly after-wards Marx corrected this mistake; as early as September 15, 1850, he broke with Schapper (Schapper found himselfwith Willich in a minority in the League and resigned fromit), who had succumbed to bourgeois-democratic revolu-tionism or utopianism to the extent of saying, “We mustachieve power at once, otherwise we may as well go to sleep. 
” Marx answered that it was incorrect to regard solely one’s own will, instead of the actual conditions, as the motiveforce of the revolution. 
 The proletariat might still have to face fifteen, twenty, or fifty years of civil wars and international conflicts “not only to change the conditions, but to change yourselves [the proletarians] and to render yourselves fit for political rule”. 
139 Plekhanov briefly mentions this change in Marx’s views and concludes: “They [Marx and Engels after this “change”] would have formulated the political tasks of the proletariat on theassumption that the democratic system had come to stay for a fairly long time. 
 But for that very reason they would have all the more emphatically condemned the participation of social-ists in a petty-bourgeois government . 
” (Iskra , No. 
 96. 
) Plekhanov’s inference is entirely false. 
 It brings us back to the confusion of socialist dictatorship and democraticdictatorship for which we have so often had occasion to criticise L. 
 Martov and Martynov. 
 Marx and Engels in 1850 did not differentiate between democratic dictatorship andsocialist dictatorship, or, rather, they did not mention theformer at all, since they considered capitalism to be in astate of senile decay and socialism near. 
 Nor did they, forthe same reason, differentiate at the time between a minimum and a maximum programme. 
 If this distinction is to be made (as it is being made now by all of us, Marxists, who arecombating the bourgeois-democratic revolutionariness ofthe “Socialists-Revolutionaries”, because they do not under-stand the distinction), then the question of the socialistand the democratic dictatorship must be dealt with separate-ly. 
 In not so doing, Plekhanov is guilty of inconsistency. 
 By choosing an evasive formulation and speaking in generalterms of “the participation of socialists in a petty-bour-geois government”, he substitutes the question of the social-ist dictatorship for the clearly, definitely and preciselypresented question of the democratic dictatorship. 
 He con-founds (to cite the comparison of Vperyod *) the participation of Millerand in a Cabinet together with Galliffet in the epochimmediately preceding the socialist revolution with that ofVarlin in a revolutionary government together with petty-bourgeois democrats who defended and safeguarded therepublic. 
 *See p. 
 282 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 Marx and Engels considered socialism near in 1850; hence, they underestimated the democratic gains, which seemed to them to be well established in view of the unquestionable victory of the petty-bourgeois democratic party. 
140 Twenty-five years later, in 1875, Marx drew attention to theundemocratic system in Germany—“military despotism,embellished with parliamentary forms”. 
 141 Thirty-five years later, in 1885, Engels predicted that in the coming European upheaval the power in Germany would pass to the petty-bourgeois democrats. 
142 What follows from this is the very reverse of what Plekhanov seeks to prove. 
 If Marx andEngels had realised that the democratic system was bound tolast for a fairly long time, they would have attached all the more importance to the democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry with the object of consolidat-ing the republic, of completely eradicating all survivalsof absolutism, and of clearing the arena for the battle forsocialism. 
 They would all the more strongly have condemned the tail-enders, who, on the eve of the democratic revolu-tion, were capable of frightening the proletariat with the possibility of a revolutionary-democratic dictatorship. 
 Plekhanov is aware of the weakness of his position, which is based on a misinterpretation of the Address. 
 He thereforemakes the discreet reservation that his reference to historydoes not claim to exhaust the subject, although he draws“exhaustively” categorical conclusions based on nothing beyond a reference which has no bearing on the matter, with no attempt even to examine the question posed con-cretely by Vperyod . 
 Plekhanov seeks to impute to Vperyod both the desire to “criticise” Marx and the point of view ofMach and Avenarius. 
 The attempt but makes us smile. 
 Ple-khanov’s position must be weak indeed if he can find no target for his darts among Vperyod ’s actual assertions but needs must contrive a target from subjects as foreign toVperyod as to the point in question. 
 Finally, Plekhanov produces another piece of evidence, which he thinks “incon-trovertible”. 
 Actually, this evidence (a letter of Engels toTurati written in 1894) is worse than useless. 
 From Plekhanov’s version of this letter (unfortunately he does not quote it in full and does not say whether it waspublished and where), it appears that Engels had to demon-strate to Turati the difference between a socialist and a petty-bourgeois revolution. 
 No more need be said, Comrade Ple-khanov! Turati is an Italian Millerand, a Bernsteinian, whom Giolitti had offered a portfolio in his Cabinet. 
 Turatievidently confounded two revolutions of an entirely different class content. 
 He imagined he would be furthering the inter-ests of proletarian rule; but Engels explained to him thatin the given situation in Italy in 1894 (i. 
e. 
, several decades after Italy’s ascent to the “first step”, after the conquest of political freedom, which enabled the proletariat to organiseopenly, widely, and independently!), he, Turati, in a Cabinetof the victorious petty-bourgeois party, would actuallybe defending and promoting the interests of an alien class , the petty bourgeoisie. 
 What we have here, consequently, is a case of Millerandism. 
 It was against this confounding of Millerandism with the democratic dictatorship that Vperyod spoke out; but Plekhanov made no mention whatever ofVperyod ’s arguments. 
 This is a characteristic instance of the false position against which Engels had long warned the lead-ers of the extreme parties, that is, a position in which they fail to grasp the true nature of the revolution and unconscious-ly further the interests of an “alien” class. 
 In the name ofall that is sacred, Comrade Plekhanov, what on earth hasthis to do with the question raised by Martynov and ana-lysed by Vperyod ? If there is the danger that people who have risen to the first step may confound the second step with the third, can this danger serve as justification for frightening us, as we are about to mount the first step, with the perspec-tive of possibly having to take two at once? No, Plekhanov’s “brief reference to history” proves pre-cisely nothing. 
 His basic conclusion that “to participate ina revolutionary government together with representatives of the petty bourgeoisie would be a betrayal of the prole-tariat” is not in the least corroborated by references to thesituation in Germany in 1850 or in Italy in 1894, which wereradically different from the situation in Russia in Januaryand May 1905. 
 These references add nothing to the questionof the democratic dictatorship and of the provisional revo-lutionary government. 
 And if Plekhanov should want to apply his conclusion to this question, if he considers every participation of the proletariat in a revolutionary government in the course of the struggle for the republic, in the course of the democratic revolution, inadmissible in principle , we undertake to prove to him that this is an anarchistic “principle” unequivocally condemned by Engels. 
 We shalldemonstrate this point in our next article. 
 A R T I C L E T W O ONLY BELOW, OR ABOVE AS WELL AS BELOW? In our previous article analysing Plekhanov’s reference to history we showed that he draws unwarranted general con-clusions on points of principle from statements by Marx, which apply wholly and exclusively to the concrete situation in Germany in 1850. 
 That concrete situation fully explainswhy Marx did not raise, and at that time could not haveraised, the question of the Communist League’s participa-tion in a provisional revolutionary government. 
 We shallnow proceed to examine the general, fundamental question of the admissibility of such participation. 
 In the first place, the question at issue must be accu-rately presented. 
 In this respect, fortunately, we are ableto use a formulation given by our opponents and thus avoidarguments on the essence of the dispute. 
 Iskra , No. 
 93, says: “The best way towards achieving such organisation [the organisation of the proletariat into a party in opposi-tion to the bourgeois-democratic state] is to develop thebourgeois revolution from below [Iskra ’s italics] through the pressure of the proletariat on the democrats in power. 
”Iskra goes on to say that Vperyod “wants this pressure of the proletariat on the revolution to proceed not only ‘from below’, not only from the street, but also from above, from the marble halls of the provisional government”. 
 The issue is thus clearly stated. 
 Iskra wants pressure from below, Vperyod wants it “from above as well as from below”. 
 Pressure from below is pressure by the citizens onthe revolutionary government. 
 Pressure from above is pres-sure by the revolutionary government on the citizens. 
 Some limit their activity to pressure from below; others do not agree with such a limitation and demand that pressure from below be supplemented by pressure from above. 
 The issue, consequently, reduces itself to the question contained in our subtitle: only from below, or from above as well as from below? Some consider it wrong in principle for theproletariat, in the epoch of the democratic revolution, toexert pressure from above, “from the marble halls of theprovisional government”. 
 Others consider it wrong in prin-ciple for the proletariat, in the epoch of the democratic revolution, to reject entirely pressure from above, to renounce participation in the provisional revolutionarygovernment. 
 Thus, the question is not whether pressure fromabove is probable in a given situation, or whether it ispracticable under a given alignment of forces. 
 We are forthe moment not considering any concrete situation, and in view of the numerous attempts to substitute one question at issue for another, we urgently ask the readers to bear thisin mind. 
 We are dealing with the general question of prin-ciple, whether in the epoch of the democratic revolutionit is admissible to pass from pressure from below to pres-sure from above. 
 To elucidate this question, let us first refer to the history of the tactical views of the founders of scientific socialism. 
Were there no disputes in this history over the generalquestion of the admissibility of pressure from above? Therewas such a dispute. 
 It was caused by the Spanish insurrec-tion of the summer of 1873. 
 Engels assessed the lessons which the socialist proletariat should learn from that insurrection in an article entitled “The Bakuninists at Work”, printedin the German Social-Democratic newspaper Volksstaat 143 in 1873 and reprinted in the pamphlet Internationales aus dem Volksstaat in 1894. 
 Let us see what general conclusions Engels drew. 
 On February 9, 1873, King Amadeo of Spain abdicated the throne—“the first king to go on strike”, as Engels face-tiously remarks. 
 On February 12 the republic was proclaimed,soon to be followed by a Carlist revolt in the Basqueprovinces. 
 April 10 saw the election of a Constituent Assemblywhich, on June 8, proclaimed the federal republic. 
 On June 11 a new Cabinet was formed by Pi y Margall. 
 In the commis-sion charged with drafting the constitution the extreme repub-licans, known as the “Intransigentes”, were not represented. 
 And when, on July 3, the new constitution was proclaimed the Intransigentes rose in revolt. 
 Between July 5 and 11 they gained the upper hand in the Seville, Granada, Alcoy, Valencia, and several other provinces. 
 The government ofSalmeron, who succeeded Pi y Margall when the latterresigned, sent troops against the rebel provinces. 
 The revoltwas suppressed after a more or less stiff resistance. 
 Cádiz fellon July 26, 1873, and Cartagena on January 11, 1874. 
 Such are the brief chronological facts with which Engels intro-duces his subject. 
 In evaluating the lessons to be drawn from these events, Engels stresses, first, that the struggle for the republicin Spain was not and could not have been a struggle for thesocialist revolution. 
 “Spain,” he says, “is such an indus-trially backward country that there can be no thought of an immediate complete emancipation there of the working class of that country. 
 Before it comes to that, Spain will haveto pass through various preliminary stages of developmentand remove a considerable number of obstacles from its path. 
The republic offered that country the chance of going through those preliminary stages in the shortest possible time and of quickly surmounting the obstacles. 
 But that chance couldbe utilised only through the active political intervention of the Spanish working class. 
 The mass of the workers feltthis. 
 They strove everywhere to have a part in the events,to take advantage of the opportunity for action, instead of leaving the owning classes, as heretofore, a clear field for action and intrigues. 
” It was thus a question of struggle for the republic, a question of the democratic, not of the socialist, revolution. 
The question of the workers’ taking a hand in the eventspresented itself in a twofold aspect at the time. 
 On the one hand, the Bakuninists (or “Alliancists”—the founders of the “Alliance” for struggle against the Marxist “Inter-national”) negated political activity, participation inelections, etc. 
 On the other hand, they were against partic-ipation in a revolution which did not aim at the immediateand complete emancipation of the working class; they were against participation of whatever kind in a revolutionary government. 
 It is this second aspect of the question thatholds special interest for us in the light of our dispute. 
 It was this aspect, incidentally, which gave rise to the for-mulation of the difference in principle between the two tactical slogans. 
 “The Bakuninists,” says Engels, “had for years been prop-agating the idea that all revolutionary action from above was pernicious , and that everything must be organised and carried out from below upward . 
” Hence, the principle, “only from below” is an anarchist principle. 
 Engels demonstrates the utter absurdity of this principle in the epoch of the democratic revolution. 
 Itnaturally and inevitably leads to the practical conclusion thatthe establishment of revolutionary governments is a betrayalof the working class. 
 The Bakuninists drew this very conclusion, which they elevated into a principle, namely, that “ the establishment of a revolutionary government is but a new deception and a new betrayal of the workingclass . 
” We have here, as the reader will see, the same two “prin-ciples” which the new Iskra has arrived at, namely: (1) that only revolutionary action from below is admissible, as opposed to the tactics of “from above as well as frombelow”; (2) that participation in a provisional revolutionarygovernment is a betrayal of the working class. 
 Both thesenew-Iskra principles are anarchist principles. 
 The actual course of the struggle for the republic in Spain revealed the utter preposterousness and the utterly reactionary essence of both these principles. 
 Engels brings this truth home with several episodes from the Spanish revolution. 
 The revolution, for example,breaks out in Alcoy, a manufacturing town of comparativelyrecent origin with a population of 30,000. 
 The workers’ insurrection is victorious despite its leadership by the Bakuninists, who will, in principle, have nothing to do withthe idea of organising the revolution. 
 After the event theBakuninists began to boast that they had become “mastersof the situation”. 
 And how did these “masters” deal withtheir “situation”, asks Engels. 
 First of all, they established in Alcoy a “Welfare Committee”, that is, a revolutionary gov-ernment. 
 Mind you, it was these selfsame Alliancists (Baku-ninists), who, only ten months before the revolution, had resolved at their Congress, on September 15, 1872, that “every organisation of a political, so-called provisional or revolutionary power can only be a new fraud and would be as dangerous to the proletariat as all existing governments”. 
Rather than refute this anarchist phrase-mongering, Engelsconfines himself to the sarcastic remark that it was the sup-porters of this resolution who found themselves “membersof this provisional and revolutionary governmental power” in Alcoy. 
 Engels treats these gentlemen with the scorn they deserve for the “utter helplessness, confusion, and passivity”which they revealed when in power. 
 With equal contemptEngels would have answered the charges of “Jacobinism”, sodear to the Girondists of Social-Democracy. 
 He shows thatin a number of other towns, e. 
g. 
, in Sanlúcar de Barrameda (a port of 26,000 inhabitants near Cádiz) “the Alliancists ... here too, in opposition to their anarchist principles,formed a revolutionary government”. 
 He reproves them for“not having known what to do with their power”. 
 Knowingwell that the Bakuninist labour leaders participated in pro-visional governments together with the Intransigentes , i. 
e. 
, together with the republicans, the representatives of the petty bourgeoisie, Engels reproves the Bakuninists, not fortheir participation in the government (as he should havedone according to the “principles” of the new Iskra ), but for their poor organisation , the feebleness of their partici-pation , their subordination to the leadership of the bour-geois republican gentry. 
 With what withering sarcasm Engels would have flayed those people who, in the epoch of therevolution, try to minimise the importance of “technical”and military leadership, may incidentally be seen from thefact that he reproved the Bakuninist labour leaders forhaving, as members of the revolutionary government, left the “political and military leadership” to the bourgeois republican gentry, while they fed the workers with bombasticphrases and paper schemes of “social” reforms. 
 A true Jacobin of Social-Democracy, Engels not only appreciated the importance of action from above, he not onlyviewed participation in a revolutionary government together with the republican bourgeoisie as perfectly legitimate, but he demanded such participation, as well as energetic military initiative on the part of the revolutionary power, considering it his duty to give practical and guiding military advice. 
 ‘Nevertheless,” he says, “the uprising, even if begun in a brainless way, would have had a good chance to succeed,had it been conducted with some intelligence , * if only in the manner of the Spanish military revolts, in which thegarrison of one town rises, marches on to the next, sweepingalong with it the town’s garrison previously worked on by propaganda, and, growing into an avalanche, the insurgents press on to the capital, until a fortunate engagement, orthe crossing over to their side of the troops sent againstthem, decides the victory. 
 This method was especially appli-cable in the given situation. 
 The insurgents had long beenorganised everywhere into volunteer battalions, whose dis-cipline, true, was pitiable, yet assuredly not more pitiable than that of the remnants of the old, largely demoralisedSpanish army. 
 The government’s only dependable troopswere the gendarmes, and these were scattered all over thecountry. 
 The thing was, above all, to prevent these gendarmesfrom being drawn together, which could be done only by a bold assumption of the offensive in the open field. 
 Such a course of action would not have involved much danger, sincethe government could only put up against the volunteersequally undisciplined troops. 
 For anyone bent on winningthere was no other way. 
 ” That is how a founder of scientific socialism reasoned when faced with the problems of an uprising and direct action in the epoch of a revolutionary upheaval! Althoughthe uprising was begun by the petty-bourgeois republicansand although confronting the proletariat was neither thequestion of the socialist revolution nor that of elementarypolitical freedom, Engels set very great store on the highly active participation of the workers in the struggle for the republic; he demanded of the proletariat’s leaders that theyshould subordinate their entire activity to the need for *Wäre er nur mit einigem Verstand geleitet worden . 
 Poor Engels! A pity he was not acquainted with the new Iskra ! He would have known then how disastrous, noxious, utopian, bourgeois, technically one-sided, and conspiratorially narrow is the “Jacobin” idea that an insurrec-tion can be conducted (geleitet werden )! achieving victory in the struggle, which had begun. 
 Engels himself, as a leader of the proletariat, even went into the details of military organisation; he was not averse to using the old-fashioned methods of struggle by military revoltswhen victory demanded it; he attached paramount impor-tance to offensive action and the centralisation of the rev-olutionary forces. 
 He bitterly reproved the Bakuninistsfor having made a principle of “what in the German Peasant War and in the German uprisings of May 1849 was an una-voidable evil, namely, the state of disunion and isolation of the revolutionary forces , which enabled the same govern-ment troops to put down one uprising after another. 
” Engels’views on the conduct of the uprising, on the organisationof the revolution, and on the utilisation of the revolutionary governmental power are as far removed from the tail-ist views of the new Iskra as heaven is from earth. 
 Summarising the lessons of the Spanish revolution, Engels established in the first place that “the Bakuninists, as soonas they were confronted with a serious revolutionary situa-tion, were compelled to give up their whole former pro-gramme”. 
 To begin with, they had to scrap the principle of abstention from political activity and from elections,the principle of the “abolition of the state”. 
 Secondly, “theygave up the principle that the workers must not partic-ipate in any revolution that did not aim at the immediateand complete emancipation of the proletariat, and they them-selves participated in an avowedly purely bourgeois move-ment”. 
 Thirdly, and this conclusion answers precisely thepoint in dispute, “they trampled underfoot the article offaith they had only just proclaimed—that the establishmentof a revolutionary government is but a new deception and anew betrayal of the working class; they did this, sitting cool-ly in the government committees of the various towns, almost everywhere as an impotent minority outvoted andpolitically exploited by the bourgeois”. 
 By their inabilityto lead the uprising, by splitting the revolutionary forcesinstead of centralising them, by leaving the leadership ofthe revolution to the bourgeois, and by dissolving the solid and strong organisation of the International, “the Bakunin-ists in Spain gave us an unsurpassable example of how not to make a revolution”. 
 /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR Summing up the foregoing, we arrive at the following conclusions: 1) Limitation, in principle, of revolutionary action to pressure from below and renunciation of pressure also fromabove is anarchism . 
 2) He who does not understand the new tasks in the epoch of revolution, the tasks of action from above, he who isunable to determine the conditions and the programme for such action, has no idea whatever of the tasks of the proletariat in every democratic revolution. 
 3) The principle that for Social-Democracy participa-tion in a provisional revolutionary government with thebourgeoisie is inadmissible, that every such participation isa betrayal of the working class, is a principle of anarchism . 
 4) Every “serious revolutionary situation” confronts the party of the proletariat with the task of giving purposiveleadership to the uprising, of organising the revolution, ofcentralising all the revolutionary forces, of boldly launch-ing a military offensive, and of making the most energeticuse of the revolutionary governmental power. 
 5) Marx and Engels could not have approved, and never would have approved, the tactics of the new Iskra at the present revolutionary moment; for these tactics are nothingshort of a repetition of all the errors enumerated above. 
Marx and Engels would have called the new Iskra ’s doctri-nal position a contemplation of the “posterior” of the prole-tariat, a rehash of anarchist errors. 
 In the next article we shall discuss the tasks of the provi-sional revolutionary government. 
 144 DEBACLE The naval battle in the Korea Strait has captured the attention of the political press the world over. 
 At firstthe tsarist government tried to conceal the bitter truth from its loyal subjects, but it soon realised the hopeless-ness of such an attempt. 
 In any case it would have been im-possible to conceal the utter rout of the entire Russian navy. 
 In appraising the political significance of the last naval battle, we can only repeat what we said in Vperyod , No. 
 2, * on the fall of Port Arthur. 
 The complete military debacle of tsarist Russia had become evident by then, but the Bal-tic squadron still gave the Russian patriots a ray of hope. 
All realised that the outcome of the war depended on victoryat sea. 
 The autocracy understood that an adverse outcomeof the war would be tantamount to a victory of the “inter-nal enemy”, viz. 
, of the revolution. 
 It, therefore, staked its all. 
 Hundreds of millions of rubles were spent on hastily dispatching the Baltic fleet, motley crews were scraped togeth-er, final preparations to get the warships into sea trim wererushed through, and old tubs were added to the new andpowerful battle-ships to increase the total number of craft. 
The great armada—as huge and unwieldy, as absurd, helpless, and monstrous as the whole Russian Empire—put to sea, expending a fortune in coal and maintenance, makingitself the laughing-stock of Europe, especially after itsbrilliant victory over the fishing smacks, and grossly violatingall the usages and principles of neutrality. 
 According tothe most conservative estimates this armada cost nearly 300,000,000 rubles, besides 100,000,000 rubles on the expedi-*See pp.

 tion. 
 Altogether 400,000,000 rubles were thrown away on this last war gamble of the tsarist autocracy. 
 Now this last gamble, too, has failed. 
 Everyone had expected the defeat of the Russian fleet, but no one hadthought it would be so crushing. 
 Like a horde of savages, theRussian ships flung themselves headlong upon the Japanesefleet, which was magnificently armed and equipped with themost up-to-date means of defence. 
 After a two-day battle, thirteen of Russia’s twenty warships manned by from twelve to fifteen thousand, were sunk or destroyed, four were cap-tured, and only one (the Almaz ) escaped and reached Vladi-vostok. 
 More than half the crews were killed or drowned,and Rozhdestvensky “himself” and his right-hand man,Nebogatov, were taken prisoner, while the Japanese fleet came out of the engagement unscathed, except for the loss of three destroyers. 
 Russia’s naval strength has been completely destroyed. 
 The war has been lost irretrievably. 
 The complete expulsionof the Russian troops from Manchuria and the seizure ofSakhalin and Vladivostok by the Japanese are now only a matter of time. 
 We are witnessing, not just a military defeat, but the complete military collapse of the autocracy; With every new blow struck by the Japanese, the significance of this collapse, as the collapse of the entirepolitical system of tsarism, grows clearer both to Europe andto the whole Russian people. 
 Everything is up in arms against the autocracy: the wounded national pride of the big and petty bourgeoisie, the outraged pride of the army,the bitter feeling over the loss of hundreds of thousands ofyoung lives in a senseless military adventure, the resentmentagainst the embezzlement of hundreds of millions from thepublic funds, the fears of an inevitable financial collapse and a protracted economic crisis as a result of the war, and the dread of a formidable people’s revolution which (in the opin-ion of the bourgeoisie) the tsar could and should have avoid-ed by means of timely and “reasonable” concessions. 
 Thedemand for peace is spreading far and wide. 
 The liberal pressis indignant. 
 Even the most moderate elements, like the landowners of the “Shipov” trend, are beginning to utter threats, and even the sycophantic Novoye Vremya is demand-ing the immediate convening of representatives of the people. 
 The European bourgeoisie, that most faithful prop of the tsarist government, is also beginning to lose patience. 
 It is alarmed at the inevitable realignment in international relations, at the growing power of the young and fresh Japan,and the loss of a military ally in Europe. 
 It is disturbedover the fate of the thousands of millions which it has sogenerously lent to the autocracy. 
 It is seriously perturbedby the revolution in Russia, which is unduly exciting the European proletariat and may lead to a revolutionary conflagration on a world scale. 
 In the name of “friendship”with tsarism it appeals to its common sense, insists on thenecessity of peace—peace with Japan, and peace with theliberal Russian bourgeoisie. 
 Europe does not for a momentshut its eyes to the fact that peace with Japan can now be bought only at a very high price; but it figures out in sober and business-like fashion that every extra month of warabroad and of revolution at home is bound to raise the pricestill higher and increase the danger of a revolutionary explo-sion that would blow the entire policy of “concessions” awaylike whiffs of smoke. 
 Europe understands that it is terribly difficult, almost impossible, for the autocracy to call a halt now—it has gone too far for that; and so this bourgeoisEurope tries to reassure itself and its ally with roseate dreams. 
 The following, for example, is from a short article by Cornély entitled “The End of an Epic”, which appeared inLe Siècle , a newspaper of the patriotic French bourgeoisie: “Now with the Russians beaten at sea after having been defeated on land, it is incumbent upon their government toconclude peace and reorganise its armed forces. 
 Adventur-ist governments are sometimes compelled, on the strengthof their pretensions or by considerations of security, toinvolve the peoples over which they rule in war. 
 Since they have staked their very existence on a victorious outcome, they demand sacrifice upon sacrifice from their peoples, thusleading them to ultimate disaster. 
 Such was the history ofour two empires in France. 
 Such would have been the his-tory of the third empire, if its establishment in our countryhad met with success. 
 “Such, on the contrary, is not the position of the Russian Government; this government is deeply rooted among theRussian people, so that common misfortunes do not divide the government and the people but only cement the bonds between them. 
 A Caesar vanquished is no longer Caesar. 
 An unfortunate tsar may yet remain august and popular. 
” Alack and alas! The braggadocio of this chauvinistic French shopkeeper is “all too obvious”. 
 His assurancesthat the war has caused no rift between the Russian Govern-ment and the people are at such variance with the generallyknown facts that one can only smile, as at some naïve and innocent ruse. 
 To warn his friend and ally, the Russian autocrat, of the inevitable ruin towards which he, like atrue “Caesar”, is heading blindly and doggedly, the Frenchbourgeois kindly assures this Caesar that he need not re-semble other Caesars, that he has a different, a better wayout. 
 We soon believe what we desire. 
 The French bourgeoi-sie is so desirous of having a powerful ally in the person of the tsar that it comforts itself with the romantic fablethat misfortune unites the Russian people with its tsar. 
M. 
 Cornély does not take this fable seriously himself, andstill less should we. 
 Not only the Caesarian governments were given to adventurism, but also the governments of the most legitimate monarchs of a most ancient dynasty. 
 There has been moreadventurism in the Russian autocracy, which is a wholecentury behind the times, than in any of the French empires. 
It was sheer adventurism that made the autocracy plungethe people into this senseless and shameful war. 
 Now the autocracy is facing the end it deserves. 
 The war has laid bare all its sores, revealed its rottenness to the core, provedits complete alienation from the people, and destroyedthe sole pillars of its Caesarian rule. 
 The war has proveda stern trial. 
 The people have already passed sentence on thisgovernment of brigands. 
 The revolution will execute the sentence. 
 Proletary , No. 
 3, Published according to June 9 (May 27), 1905 the text in Proletary REVOLUTIONARY STRUGGLE AND LIBERAL BROKERAGE The rise of political parties is one of the most interesting and characteristic features of our interesting epoch. 
 The old order, the autocracy, is falling to pieces. 
 Increasingsections, not only of so-called “society”, i. 
e. 
, the bour-geoisie, but also of the “people”, i. 
e. 
, the working classand the peasantry, have begun to reflect on the kind of neworder that has to be built and on the way to build it. 
 For the class-conscious proletariat these attempts of the various classes to frame a programme and organise the politicalstruggle are of momentous importance. 
 Although these at-tempts largely originate from individual “figures” responsibleto no one and leading no one, and are therefore often for-tuitous, arbitrary, and at times bombastic, the basic interests and tendencies of the big social classes, broadly speaking, assert themselves with irresistible force. 
 Out of the seemingchaos of declarations, demands, and platforms there clearlyemerge the political physiognomy of our bourgeoisie andits real (not only specious) political programme. 
 Theproletariat is obtaining increasingly more material by which to judge how the Russian bourgeoisie, which now talks of political action, is really going to act—what stand itwill take in the decisive revolutionary struggle towardswhich Russia is so rapidly heading. 
 Valuable material for studying the policy of the bourgeoi-sie is sometimes offered by Osvobozhdeniye , published abroad, which is able to review the numerous public utterances of the Russian liberals without censorship restrictions. 
The Programme of the Osvobozhdeniye League, which this journal has just published (or reprinted from Novosti * o f April 5) with instructive commentaries by Mr. 
 P. 
 S. 
, is an excellent addendum to the resolutions of the Zemstvo con-gresses and to the Osvobozhdeniye liberals’ draft constitution, of which we wrote in Vperyod , No. 
 18. 
** “The drafting and voting of this programme,” as Mr. 
 P. 
 S. 
 justly remarks, “is abig step towards the creation of a Russian Constitutional-Democratic Party. 
” For the Russian liberals this is unquestionably a big step, which stands out in the long list of liberal activities. 
Nevertheless, how little this big “step” of the liberals is,as compared with what is needed for building a real party,as compared even with what Social-Democracy has alreadydone to this end. 
 The bourgeoisie has far greater freedom of legal expression than the proletariat, incomparably more intellectual forces and financial means, and far greaterfacilities for party organisation; yet we still have before usa “party” without an official name, without a common,distinct, and lucid programme, without worked-out tactics,without a party organisation, a “party” which, according to the competent testimony of Mr. 
 P. 
 S. 
, consists of the “Zemstvo group” and the Osvobozhdeniye League, i. 
e. 
, of an unor-ganised conglomeration of individuals plus an organisation. 
But perhaps the members of the Zemstvo group are “partymembers” in the now famous sense that they accept the pro-gramme and work “under the control of a party organisation”, of a group of the Osvobozhdeniye League? Such a concep-tion of party membership is as convenient and suitable to theliberals and as natural a part of the liberal political patternas it is alien to the whole spirit of Social-Democracy. 
 Such aconception of party (expressed not in written Rules, but inthe actual structure of that “party”) implies, among other things, that the organised members, i. 
e. 
, the members of the Osvobozhdeniye League, stand, in their majority, for a unicameral system , while at the same time rejecting it in their programme, passing the whole question over in silencein deference to the unorganised membership, to the “Zemstvogroup”, which favours a bicameral system. 
 The balance of *News .

 427 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 “forces”, one might say, is providential for the politically active bourgeoisie. 
 The organised intellectuals propose, and the unorganised businessmen, money-bags, and capital-ists dispose. 
 While heartily welcoming the Programme of the Osvobo-zhdeniye League, Mr. 
 P. 
 S. 
, in principle , defends both the vagueness, inadequacy, and incompleteness of the programmeand its organisational haziness and silence on tactics— all for reasons of “ Realpolitik ”! We shall revert to this in-comparable conception, so singularly characteristic of theessence of bourgeois liberalism, and shall now proceed toexamine the basic principles of the liberal programme. 
 The party, as we have said, has no official designation Mr. 
 P. 
 S. 
 calls it by the name under which, I believe, it goes in the columns of our legal newspapers of the liberal trend, namely, “Constitutional-Democratic Party”. 
 Unim-portant though the question of name may appear at firstglance, here too we immediately find material that explainswhy the bourgeoisie, unlike the proletariat, must content itself with political vagueness and even defend it “in prin-ciple”; it “must” do this, not only on account of the subjective moods or qualities of its leaders, but by reason of the objectiveconditions governing the existence of the bourgeois classas a whole. 
 The name “Constitutional-Democratic Party”immediately calls to mind the well-known adage that speechwas given to man in order that he might conceal his thoughts. 
 The name “C. 
D. 
P. 
” was invented to conceal the monarchist nature of the party. 
 Indeed, who does not know that thisentire party, in the person both of its master section, theZemstvo group, and of the Osvobozhdeniye League, stands for the monarchy? Neither section so much as mentionsthe question of the republic, which they consider “idle talk”, while their draft constitution bluntly and unequiv-ocally accepts the monarchy as the form of government. 
We have therefore to do with a party that advocates a con-stitutional monarchy, a party of constitutional monarchists. 
This is a fact of which there is not the slightest doubt andwhich cannot be dismissed by any arguments about ac-ceptance “in principle” of the idea of a republic (though we have heard no such arguments yet from the “Constitution-al-Democrats”!), since the issue is not acceptance of the republic purely “in principle”, but acceptance in practical politics, acceptance of the will to achieve the republic and of the necessity to struggle for it. 
 The fact is that the bourgeois gentlemen cannot call them-selves by their real name yet, any more than they can goout into the street naked. 
 They cannot tell the truth openly;they cannot aussprechen was ist (speak out the truth), for that would mean admitting one of the most outrageous and pernicious of political privileges, it would mean admit-ting their anti -democratism. 
 No bourgeoisie in struggle for political liberty can admit this, and not only because itwould be disgraceful, scandalous, and indecent. 
 Nothing is tooindecent for bourgeois politicians where their interests areconcerned. 
 But their interests at the moment demand liberty, and liberty cannot be won without the people , and the backing of the people cannot be secured unless one callsoneself a “democrat” ( =an adherent of the rule of the people), unless one conceals one ’s monarchism . 
 And so the class position of the bourgeoisie inevitably gives rise to an inherent instability and falsity in the very formulation of its basic political tasks. 
 The struggle for free-dom, for the abolition of the ancient privileges of the autoc-racy, is incompatible with the defence of the privileges ofprivate property, since these privileges entail “gentle handling”of the monarchy. 
 The real programme of the monarchistconstitution, therefore, is draped in the fine, airy raiment of a democratic constitution. 
 And this embellishment of the programme’s real content with a display of tawdry tinselis called “ Realpolitik ”.... 
 Thus, the ideologist of the liberal bourgeoisie speaks with inimitable contempt and sublimeself-complacency about the “theoretical self-indulgence”which the “representatives of the extreme parties” are prac-tising ( Osvobozhdeniye , No. 
 69-70, p. 
 308). 
 The Realpoliti-ker of the bourgeoisie do not want to indulge in talk or even in day-dreams of the republic because they do not want tostruggle for the republic. 
 For this reason, however, they feelthe irresistible urge to edify the people with the enticement of “democracy”. 
 They do not want to deceive themselves with regard to their inability to renounce the monarchy, and so they must needs deceive the people by keeping silent abouttheir monarchism. 
 The name of a party, as can be seen, is not such an inciden-tal and unimportant affair as one might think at first glance. 
 Sometimes the very showiness and pretentiousness of the name betray the inherent flaw in a party’ s entireprogramme and tactical line. 
 The deeper an ideologist ofthe big bourgeoisie feels himself devoted to the monarchy,the louder he calls upon heaven to witness that he is a dem-ocrat. 
 The more an ideologist of the petty bourgeoisie reflects its instability and its incapacity to wage a con-sistent, steadfast struggle for the democratic revolutionand for socialism, the more ardently he holds forth on theparty of the “Socialists-Revolutionaries”, of which it hasbeen aptly said that its socialism is anything but revolution-ary, and its revolutionariness anything but socialist. 
 All we need now is for the adherents of the autocracy to call themselves (as they have on more than one occasion attemptedto do) “people’s party”, and we shall have a completepicture of the metamorphosis which class interests undergo onpolitical signboards. 
 The signboard of the liberal bourgeoisie (or the programme of the Osvobozhdeniye League) starts, as befits a signboard, with a striking preamble: “The Osvobozhdeniye League finds that the grave external and internal crisis through whichRussia is passing has become so acute at the present timethat the people must take its solution into their own handsin conjunction with the other social groups opposed to the existing regime. 
” And so, let the power pass into the hands of the people, long live the autocracy of the people in place of the autoc-racy of the tsar. 
 Isn’t that it, gentlemen? Isn’t that whatdemocratism demands? No, this is theoretical self-indulgence and a failure to understand practical politics. 
 All power is now in the hands of the absolute monarchy. 
 Ranged against it is the people,namely, the proletariat and the peasantry, who havelaunched the struggle, are waging it furiously, and ... verylikely will maintain their zeal until they have completelyoverthrown the enemy. 
 But ranged alongside the “people” are “the other social groups”, viz. 
, “society”, i. 
e. 
, the bourgeoisie, the landowners, the capitalists, and theprofessional intelligentsia. 
 Thus, the power is to be divided into three equal parts. 
 One-third is to be left to the monarchy, another goes to the bourgeoisie (an Upper House based on indirect, and as far as possible actually unequal and non-universal, suffrage), while the remaining thirdgoes to the people (a Lower House on the basis of suffragethat is universal, etc. 
). 
 This will be a “square deal” pro-viding adequate protection for private property and makingit possible to use the organised power of the monarchy (the army, bureaucracy, and police) against the people, should they show “zeal” for any of the “unreasonable” demands putforward by the “representatives of the extreme parties outof sheer theoretical self-indulgence”. 
 This square deal,which reduces the revolutionary people to a harmlessminority of one-third, is presented as “a radical reform on democratic principles”, and not at all on the principles of monarchism or of bourgeois privilege. 
 How is this deal to be put through? By means of honest brokerage. 
 Mr. 
 Struve predicted this long ago in his prefaceto the Witte Memorandum when he said that it is alwaysthe moderate parties that gain from the intensification of the struggle between the extreme parties. 
 The struggle between the autocracy and the revolutionary people is gain-ing in intensity. 
 One has to manoeuvre between the one andthe other, enlisting the support of the revolutionary peopleagainst the autocracy (with the enticement of “democracy”)and the support of the monarchy against the “excesses” of the revolutionary people. 
 By skilful manoeuvring a deal like that should come off, with the bourgeoisie getting atleast a “third” share in any case, while the shares allottedto the people and the autocracy would depend on the outcomeof the decisive struggle between them. 
 Whose backing shouldbe sought most will depend on the exigencies of the moment— such is the essence of the huckstering tactics, that is to say, “practical” politics. 
 At present all power is still in the hands of the autoc-racy. 
 The thing to do, therefore, is to say that the peoplemust take power into their hands. 
 The thing to do, therefore,is to call yourself a democrat, to put forward a demand for “the immediate convocation of a Constituent Assembly on the basis of suffrage that is universal, etc. 
, for the pur-pose of drawing up a Russian constitution”. 
 The people now are unarmed, disunited, unorganised, and helpless in the face of the absolute monarchy. 
 A popular Constituent Assembly will rally them and become a great force which will oppose the power of the tsar. 
 Only then, when the power of the tsarand the united force of the revolutionary people confronteach other, will the bourgeoisie have its day; then only willit be possible to “co-ordinate” these two forces with positivechances of success and ensure the most advantageous result for the propertied classes. 
 Such is the plan of the practical politicians of liberalism. 
 Not a foolish plan at all. 
 It deliberately provides for thepreservation of the monarchy and the admission of a Con-stituent Assembly of the whole people only alongside of themonarchy. 
 The bourgeoisie does not want to have the existing government overthrown or the monarchy replaced by a republic. 
 Therefore, the Russian bourgeoisie (on the patternof the German bourgeoisie of 1848) stands for a “deal” betweenthe people and the throne. 
 Such a policy can be successfulonly if neither of these parties engaged in the struggle,neither the people nor the throne, is able to win the day, only if their strength is balanced. 
 Then and only then will the bourgeoisie be able to join with the monarchy and keepa tight hold on the people, compel them to put up with one-“third”—or perhaps one-hundredth part, of the power. 
 TheConstituent Assembly of the whole people will be just strongenough to make the tsar grant a constitution, but it will not and must not (from the point of view of the bourgeoisie’s interests) be any stronger. 
 It must only counterbalance themonarchy, but not overthrow it; it must leave the materialinstruments of power (the army, etc. 
) in the hands of themonarchy. 
 The Osvobozhdeniye Leaguers laugh at the Shipovists for wanting to give the tsar the power of authority and the people the power of opinion. 
 But is not their positionessentially identical with that of the Shipovists? They donot want to give the people all the power either; they, too, stand for a compromise between the power of the tsar and the opinion of the people! We thus see that the interests of the bourgeoisie as a class quite naturally and inevitably lead it at the presentrevolutionary moment to advance the slogan of a Constituent Assembly of the people, but in no case the slogan of a provi-sional revolutionary government . 
 The first slogan is or has become the slogan of the policy of compromise, huckstering, and brokerage; the second is the slogan of revolutionarystruggle. 
 The first is the slogan of the monarchist bour-geoisie, the second, the slogan of the revolutionary people. 
The first slogan makes it possible chiefly to preserve themonarchy, despite the revolutionary onset of the people; the second offers the straight road to the republic. 
 The first leaves the power with the tsar, restricted only by publicopinion; the second is the only slogan which consistentlyand unreservedly leads to the sovereignty of the people inthe full sense of the word. 
 Only this radical difference in the political aims of the liberal bourgeoisie and the revolutionary proletariat can explain a number of secondary features in the Osvobozhdeniye programme besides those mentioned above. 
 Only in the lightof this difference is it possible to understand, for example,why the Osvobozhdeniye adherents require the reservation that the decisions of their League are to be “regarded as binding only insofar as political conditions remain un-changed”, and that the programme allows for “a provisionaland conditional element”. 
 This reservation (developedat length and with keen “relish” in the commentariesof Mr. 
 P. 
 S. 
) is absolutely essential for a party of “compro-mise” between the people and tsarism. 
 It is a reservation that makes it as clear as daylight that in pursuance of their line of huckstering (“practical”) politics the Osvobozhdeniye Leaguers will throw over a good many of their democraticdemands. 
 Their programme is not an expression of steadfastconvictions (a quality alien to the bourgeoisie), not some-thing designated to be fought for. 
 Rather, their programme is simply a haggling price , fixed beforehand with a definite view to “reduction”, depending on which of the warringparties can “hold out” longer. 
 The Constitutional -“Democrat-ic” (read : constitutional-monarchist) bourgeoisie will strike a bargain with tsarism at a cheaper price than its presentprogramme —there is no doubt of that, and the class-conscious proletariat should have no illusions on that score. 
 Hence Mr. 
 P. 
 S. 
’s hostility towards the division into a minimumprogramme and a maximum programme, and towards “firm decisions of programme in general”. 
 Hence, his assurances that the programme of the Osvobozhdeniye League (purposely couched, not in terms of definite demands precisely formulated, but in the form of a literary, approximativedescription of the demands) “ is more than adequate for a party engaged in practical politics”. 
 Hence, the omissionof any mention of the arming of the people in the programmeof the monarchist “democrats”, the avoidance of any defi-nitely formulated demand for the disestablishment of the Church, the insistence on the impracticability of abolishingindirect taxes, the substitution of cultural self-determinationof the oppressed nationalities for their political self-deter-mination. 
 Hence, the naïvely frank admission that democ-racy and the interests of capital are linked together; that instead of “protection for enterprises and businessmen, there must be greater protection for the development of the produc-tive forces of the people”; that “industrial prosperity”, etc. 
,must be promoted. 
 Hence, the reduction of the agrarianreform to the level of a purely bureaucratic “granting” of landto the peasants with an absolute guarantee that the landown-ers will be “ compensated ” for the lands assigned to the peasants. 
 In other words, the sanctity of “property” derivedfrom bondage and serfdom is to be upheld at all costs. 
 Allthis, we repeat, is the natural and inevitable result of theposition of the bourgeoisie as a class in modern society. 
 Allthis confirms the radical difference between the proletarian policy of revolutionary struggle and the bourgeois policy of liberal brokerage.

 in Yiddish, the Editorial Board of the PartyCentral Organ considers it necessary to say a few words in connection with this publication. 
 The conditions under which the class-conscious proletar-iat of the whole world lives tend to create the closest bondsand increasing unity in the systematic Social-Democraticstruggle of the workers of the various nationalities. 
 Thegreat slogan “Workers of all countries, unite!”, which was proclaimed for the first time more than half a century ago, has now become more than the slogan of just the Social-Democratic parties of the different countries. 
 This sloganis being increasingly embodied both in the unification ofthe tactics of international Social-Democracy and in thebuilding of organisational unity among the proletarians of the various nationalities who are struggling under the yoke of one and the same despotic state for freedom and socialism. 
 In Russia the workers of all nationalities, especially those of non-Russian nationality, endure an economic and polit-ical oppression such as obtains in no other country. 
 TheJewish workers, as a disfranchised nationality, not only suffer general economic and political oppression, but they also suffer under the yoke which deprives them of elementarycivic rights. 
 The heavier this yoke, the greater the needfor the closest possible unity among the proletarians of thedifferent nationalities; for without such unity a victoriousstruggle against the general oppression is impossible. 
 The more the predatory tsarist autocracy strives to sow the seeds of discord, distrust and enmity among the nationalitiesit oppresses, the more abominable its policy of inciting the ignorant masses to savage pogroms becomes, the more does the duty devolve upon us, the Social-Democrats, to rally the isolated Social-Democratic parties of the different nationalities into a single Russian Social-Democratic LabourParty. 
 The First Congress of our Party, held in the spring of 1898, set itself the aim of establishing such unity. 
 To dis-pel any idea of its being national in character, the Party called itself “ Rossiiskaya ” and not “ Russkaya ”. 
 * The organisation of Jewish workers—the Bund—affiliated withthe Party as an autonomous section. 
 Unfortunately, fromthat moment the unity of the Jewish and non-Jewish Social-Democrats within the single party was destroyed. 
 National-ist ideas began to spread among the leading members of the Bund, ideas which are in sharp contradiction to the entire world view of Social-Democracy. 
 Instead of trying to drawthe Jewish and the non-Jewish workers closer together, theBund embarked upon a policy of weaning the former awayfrom the latter; at its congresses it claimed a separate exist-ence for the Jews as a nation. 
 Instead of carrying on the work begun by the First Congress of the Russian Social-Democratic Party towards still closer unity between theBund and the Party, the Bund moved a step away from theParty. 
 First, it withdrew from the united organisation of theR.

 abroad and set up an independent organisationabroad; later, it withdrew from the R. 
S.

L. 
P as well, when the Second Congress of our Party in 1903 refused by a considerable majority to recognise the Bund as sole repre-sentative of the Jewish proletariat. 
 The Bund held to itsposition, claiming not only that it was the sole represent-ative of the Jewish proletariat, but that no territorial limitswere set to its activities. 
 Naturally, the Second Congress of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 could not accept such conditions, since in a number of regions, as, for instance, in South Russia,the organised Jewish proletariat constitutes part of the gen-eral Party organisation. 
 Ignoring that stand, the Bund with-drew from the Party and thereby broke the unity of theSocial-Democratic proletariat, despite the work that had *The adjective Russkaya (Russian) pertains to nationality, Ros-siiskaya (Russian) pertains to Russia as a country. 
— Ed. 
 been carried out in common at the Second Congress, and despite the Party Programme and Rules. 
 At its Second and Third Congresses the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party expressed its firm conviction thatthe Bund’s withdrawal from the Party was a grave and de-plorable mistake on its part. 
 The Bund’s mistake is a resultof its basically untenable nationalist views; the result ofits groundless claim to be the sole, monopolistic representa-tive of the Jewish proletariat, from which the federalist principle of organisation necessarily derives; the resultof its long-standing policy of keeping aloof and separatefrom the Party. 
 We are convinced that this mistake must berectified and that it will be rectified as the movement contin-ues to grow. 
 We consider ourselves ideologically at one with the Jewish Social-Democratic proletariat. 
 After the Second Congress our Central Committee pursued a non-nationalistpolicy; it took pains that such committees should be setup (Polesye, North-Western) as would unite all the localworkers, Jewish as well as non-Jewish, into a single whole.

 The Report will show the Jewish workers that our Party is already emerg-ing from the internal crisis from which it has been sufferingsince the Second Congress. 
 It will show them what the actualaspirations of our Party are and what its attitude is towardsthe Social-Democratic parties and organisations of the other nationalities, as well as the attitude of the entire Party and its central body to its component parts.

 with regard to the policy of the entire class-conscious proletariat in the present revolutionary situation. 
 Comrades! The hour of political struggle against the tsarist autocracy is drawing near—the struggle of the prole-tariat for the freedom of all classes and peoples in Russia, for the freedom of the proletarian drive towards socialism. 
 Terrible trials are in store for us. 
 The outcome of the revolution in Russia depends on our class-consciousness and preparedness, on our unity and determination. 
 Let us set towork then with greater boldness and greater unity, let usdo all in our power for the proletarians of the differentnationalities to march to freedom under the leadership of areally united Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party.

 (issued in Yiddish) A NEW REVOLUTIONARY WORKERS ’ ASSOCIATION We have received the following leaflets of the Central Committee of the Russian Liberation Union (R. 
L. 
U. 
),printed and distributed in Russia: (1) an unaddressed appeal setting forth the aims and the nature of the R. 
L. 
U. 
; (2) an appeal to the workers concerning the establishment of theR. 
L. 
U. 
 Workers’ Union, and (3) the Rules of this Workers’Union. 
 From these documents it is evident that “the R. 
L. 
U. 
is not a party with a definite and specific programme, butrather an association of all who desire the transfer of power from the autocracy to the people by means of the armed uprising and through the convocation of a ConstituentAssembly” based on universal suffrage with all its democraticaspects. 
 “The urgent necessity,” we read in the firstappeal, “of achieving the universal immediate objective,i. 
e. 
, a Constituent Assembly, has given rise to the R. 
L. 
U. 
, which has made it its aim to unite all who strive for the po-litical freedom of Russia and to take practical steps to achievethe revolution. 
 With the achievement of this objectivethe R. 
L. 
U. 
 will discontinue its activities and entrust theprotection of the people’s representatives and of publicsafety to a civil militia to be organised for the purpose. 
” The Rules of the Workers’ Union consist of 43 clauses, and their aim is set forth as follows: “(1) to organise combatgroups for the armed uprising; (2) to raise the necessary fundsfor arms and for literature of a strictly proletarian nature. 
”The organisation of the Workers’ Union consists of four-stage bodies: (1) groups of workers (mainly from one and the same workshop); (2) factory councils; (3) district meetings; and (4) committees of the Workers’ Union. 
 All higher bodiesconsist of elected representatives of the lower bodies, with two exceptions: first, each committee of the Workers’ Union contains a member of the C. 
C. 
 of the Russian Liberation Union; second, it is not specified whether this C. 
C. 
 is elected or whether it is subject to any control. 
 All that is said onthe relations between the Workers’ Union and the R. 
L. 
U. 
is: “Through us (the C. 
C. 
 of the R. 
L. 
U. 
) the Workers’ Unionwill be connected with all the other workers’ and non-work-ing-class associations. 
” Not a word is mentioned about the organisation of the R. 
L. 
U. 
 itself and the relation of its C. 
C. 
 to the R. 
L. 
U. 
 as a whole. 
 In its appeal to the workers theC. 
C. 
 of the R. 
L. 
U. 
 sets forth its immediate task as follows:“We shall work out a detailed plan of the uprising, tellyou how to form combat squads, teach you how to arm, andsupply fire-arms. 
 Lastly, we shall unite the activities of all people scattered in all towns and places, who want to free Russia from the yoke of the autocracy, and, when that unityhas been achieved, we will give the signal for the generaluprising. 
” Finally, we would point out that the Rules of theWorkers’ Union (§ 4) say: “The appeal to form the Workers’ Union will be distributed at all the factories of St. 
 Petersburg and its environs. 
” From all this it is apparent that we have to do here with an attempt at an “independent” non-party organisation ofthe armed popular uprising in general and the uprising ofthe St. 
 Petersburg workers in particular. 
 We shall not dwellhere on the question to what extent this attempt is serious; that can be judged conclusively only from its results and tentatively from private and secret information about theR. 
L. 
U. 
, but we have no such information. 
 We wish to touch therefore on the significance of this attempt in terms ofprinciple and the tactical and organisational tasks whichit poses for Social-Democracy. 
 Without doubt, we are dealing here with weighty evi-dence pointing to the fact that the question of the armedpopular uprising is now looming large. 
 It is a questionwhich practical workers as well as theoreticians have nowraised. 
 It is posed, not as a conclusion drawn from adefinite programme (as it was, for instance, in Social-Demo-cratic literature abroad in 1902), * but as a vital issue *See present edition, Vol. 
 5, p. 
 515. 
— Ed. 
 of the practical movement today. 
 It is not a question now of discussing the problem, or even of preparing for the uprising in general, but of actually carrying out the uprising. 
 Manifestly, the whole course of events brings to the fore the question of the uprising; the whole struggle for freedom has made necessary such a decisive outcome. 
From this it is clear, by the way, how deeply mistakenthose Social-Democrats are who seek to prevent the Party from putting this task on the order of the day. 
 Furthermore, the attempt we have considered proves that the revolutionary-democratic movement in Russia has made a great stride forward. 
 A long time back, in issue No. 
 7 ofVperyod , * we pointed out the emergence of this new group among the forces, parties, and organisations hostile to the autocracy. 
 We pointed out that the very nature of the revolu-tion taking place in Russia, namely, the bourgeois-democraticrevolution, inevitably increased and multiplied, andwould continue to increase and multiply, the most diversemilitant elements who expressed the interests of the mostdiverse sections of the people, who were prepared for decisive struggle and were passionately devoted to the cause of free-dom and prepared to sacrifice their all for that cause, butwho did not and could not grasp either the historic signifi-cance or the class content of the revolution that was takingplace. 
 The rapid growth of these social elements is highlycharacteristic of an epoch in which the whole people is oppressed by the autocracy and in which the direct political struggle has not yet succeeded in clearly demarcating theclasses and creating clearly defined parties understandableto the broad masses. 
 All these undissociated and undefinedelements form the cadres of the revolutionary democrats. 
Their militant significance for the democratic revolution is very great. 
 Their non-party, indefinite position is, on the one hand, symptomatic of the fact that the intermediatesections of the population are rising to desperate struggleand revolt—the sections that have least of all merged witheither of the two hostile classes in capitalist society, the sec-tions of the peasantry, the petty bourgeoisie, etc. 
 On the other hand, the fact that these non-party revolutionaries *See pp. 
 164-65 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 have set out upon the revolutionary path is a pledge that the utterly backward sections of the people, those farthest removed from class definiteness, will now be more easily, quickly, and broadly aroused and drawn into the struggle. 
Formerly only the intelligentsia in Russia was revolutionary. 
Later the urban proletariat turned revolutionary. 
 Todaya considerable number of other social elements, deeply rooted“in the people” and closely linked with the masses, are turn-ing revolutionary against the autocracy. 
 The active partic-ipation of these elements is essential to the cause of thepopular uprising. 
 Their militant significance, we repeat, is very great. 
 But their political significance for the pro-letarian movement may sometimes be small, if not actually negative. 
 These elements are simply revolutionary and simply democratic because association with the one definite class which has cut loose from the ruling bourgeoisie, viz. 
, theproletariat, is alien to them. 
 By fighting for freedom withoutclose connection with the proletarian struggle for socialism,they play a role that objectively amounts to promotingthe interests of the bourgeoisie. 
 They who serve the cause of freedom in general without serving the specific cause of proletarian utilisation of this freedom, the cause of turn-ing the freedom to account in the proletarian struggle forsocialism, are, in the final analysis, plainly and simply,fighters for the interests of the bourgeoisie. 
 We do not inthe least belittle the heroism of these people. 
 We certainly do not belittle their tremendous role in the struggle for freedom. 
 But we do not cease to maintain with the utmostemphasis that their activity does not yet in the leastguarantee that the fruits of victory, the fruits of freedom, willbe utilised in the interest of the proletariat, of socialism. 
They who stand outside the parties thereby serve the inter-ests of the ruling party, albeit unwittingly and against their will. 
 They who struggle for freedom outside the partiesthereby serve the interests of the force that will inevitablyrule when freedom is won, viz. 
, the interests of the bourgeoi-sie. 
 For this reason we called the non-party organisationof the uprising “independent” in inverted commas. 
 Actually, non-partyism, with its appearance of independence, implies utter lack of independence and utter dependence on the rul-ing party. 
 Actually, the just plain revolutionaries, the just plain democrats are no more than the vanguard of the bourgeois-democratic movement, and sometimes merely its auxiliary force, even its cannon-fodder. 
 We pass now from these general theses to a more detailed examination of the documents in hand. 
 “Let usabandon for a time party disputes and differences on points ofprinciple,” exclaims the C. 
C. 
 of the R. 
L. 
U. 
 in its first call,“let us rally into a mighty whole, into the Russian Liberation Union, and give our strength, our funds, and our knowledge to the people in its great struggle with the commonenemy, the autocracy. 
 Until the Constituent Assembly isheld, we must all go along together. 
 Only the ConstituentAssembly can bring political freedom, without which aproper struggle of the parties is inconceivable. 
” Any worker who is at all class-conscious knows full well that the people struggling against the autocracy consists of the bourgeoisieand the proletariat. 
 The bourgeoisie is very keen on freedom,it is making a great stir about it, writing in the press andaddressing meetings against the autocracy. 
 Yet is there aperson so naïve who does not understand that the bourgeoisie will never give up private ownership of the land and of capi-tal, but, on the contrary, will fight to the last ditch to retainit against the encroachment of the workers? For the workerto abandon differences on questions of principle with thebourgeoisie, alongside which he is fighting the autocracy,is tantamount to abandoning socialism , to abandoning the idea of socialism, and the preparatory work for socialism. 
 For the worker, in short, it means abandoning the idea ofhis economic emancipation, the emancipation of the workingpeople from poverty and oppression. 
 All over the world thebourgeoisie struggled for freedom, which it won largely withthe hands of the workers, only thereafter to launch a furious struggle against socialism. 
 Therefore, the appeal to sink differences is a bourgeois appeal. 
 Under the guise of non-partyism the C. 
C. 
 of the R. 
L. 
U. 
 is feeding the workers withbourgeois phrases, instilling into them bourgeois ideas,demoralising their socialist consciousness with bourgeoisexhalations. 
 Only the enemies of socialism, the liberal bourgeois, the Osvobozhdeniye gentry, can be consciously in sympathy with the idea of the workers and the bourgeoissinking their differences for a time, and only revolutionary /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR democrats like the Socialists-Revolutionaries, who care little about socialism, can unconsciously be in sympathy with it. 
 The workers should fight for freedom, without even for a minute abandoning the idea of socialism, without ceasing to work for its realisation, to prepare the forces and theorganisation for the achievement of socialism. 
 The C. 
C. 
 of the R. 
L. 
U. 
 says: “As far as our attitude towards the existing parties and organisations is concerned, we, the Central Committee of the R. 
L. 
U. 
, declare that we foresee no possibility of the appearance of fundamentaldifferences with the Social-Democratic parties, since the prin-ciple of the Union does not contradict their programmes”.... 
These words show the extent to which the C. 
C. 
 of the R. 
L. 
U. 
misunderstands socialism. 
 The C. 
C. 
 does not even foresee the possibility of the appearance of differences with Social-Democracy, whereas we have shown that a fundamentaldifference exists! The C. 
C. 
 sees no contradiction between theprinciple of the Union and the programme of Social-Democ-racy, whereas we have shown that this contradiction is asprofound as the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. 
 Our radical disagreement with the R. 
L. 
U. 
 arises precisely from the fact that it passes socialism over in silence. 
 Any political trend that passes socialism over in silenceis radically opposed to the Social-Democratic programme. 
 The quoted passage shows that the R. 
L. 
U. 
 is in sympathy with Social-Democracy. 
 Knowing nothing about the R. 
L. 
U. 
 beyond the leaflet it has issued, we are not yet in a position to judge the sincerity of that sympathy. 
 At any rate, merePlatonic sympathy cannot satisfy us, mere Platonic loveis not enough. 
 We want more than sympathy, we wantto be understood and we want our programme to be sharedby those who would not like their ideas to contradict this programme. 
 The Russian Liberation Union speaks of its task of “widely distributing among the workers literatureadvocating a strictly proletarian ideology” (our italics). 
 These are very good words, but words are not enough. 
 Andif these fine words contradict the deeds, no amount of sin-cerity will save their authors in actual deeds from becoming carriers of bourgeois ideas into the working class. 
 Let us consider the matter: what does this “strictly proletarianideology” actually mean? Who is going to judge whether it is strictly proletarian? Can the problem conceivably be solved by “abandoning for a time party disputes and differences on points of principle”? Would it not then first be necessary to “abandon for a time” the distribution of literature among theworkers? The C. 
C. 
 of the R. 
L. 
U. 
 once more launches the slogan of the “independent activity” of the workers. 
 Our Party hasoften witnessed attempts to call into life a special trend in Social-Democracy under the banner of this notorious slogan. 
 Thus it was with the “Economists” in the past, thus it is nowwith the Mensheviks or the new-Iskrists. 
 Ever andalways it turned out that this slogan (whether those whoreleased it were conscious of it or not) only suited the purposeof elements who least appreciated the consistency of princi-ple and the idea-content of the movement. 
 We need only see the new use to which this old slogan has been put: we seebefore our eyes a fusion of the appeal to “independent activ-ity” in assessing a “strictly proletarian ideology” with the“independently active” repetition of anti-proletarian, bour-geois phrases, with the advocacy of the bourgeois idea of non-partyism. 
 We would answer the C. 
C. 
 of the R. 
L. 
U. 
: there is only one strictly proletarian ideology, and that is,Marxism . 
 A strictly proletarian programme and strictly proletarian tactics are the programme and the tactics ofinternational revolutionary Social-Democracy. 
 This is borneout, among other things, by proletarian experience, by the experience of the proletarian movement throughout the world, from Germany to America, from England to Italy. 
 It is overhalf a century since this movement first emerged upon thebroad political scene in 1848; the parties of the proletariatformed and grew into vast armies; they experienceda number of revolutions, underwent all kinds of trials, passed through deviations to both the Right and the Left, and waged a struggle with opportunism and with anarchism. 
This entire gigantic experience serves to confirm the Marxistideology and the Social-Democratic programme. 
 It is a pledge that even those workers who are now following the lead ofthe R. 
L. 
U. 
 will, in the mass, inevitably and unavoidably come to Social-Democracy! To quote further from the Appeal: “Being largely a practical organisation, the R. 
L. 
U. 
 is at one in its activity also with the Party of the Socialists-Revolutionaries, in-asmuch as we are united with it by a common method—armed struggle against the autocracy, and a common aim—the con-vocation of a Constituent Assembly on democratic lines.... 
”After what has been said we are not surprised, of course, atthis rapprochement of the revolutionary democrats with theSocialists-Revolutionaries. 
 While stressing the practicalnature of its organisation in the cited passage of the Appeal and limiting its solidarity with the Socialists-Revolutiona-ries (“inasmuch as”) to common grounds of method andimmediate aim, the R. 
L. 
U. 
 obviously abstains for the presentfrom determining the relationship between the “principles”of the Socialists-Revolutionaries and those of a “strictlyproletarian ideology”. 
 Such an abstention would be a very bad recommendation for a Social-Democrat, but a very good one for a revolutionary democrat. 
 Unfortunately,however, the ensuing sentence in the Appeal shows what a“non-party” stand may lead to.... 
 “We have nothing againsteven the Osvobozhdeniye League,” says the C. 
C. 
 of the R. 
L. 
U. 
, “notwithstanding the radical difference in our political convictions, provided, of course, that it brings itself to realise the inevitability of the armed uprising if a ConstituentAssembly is to be convened. 
” In the first place, we would remark in this connection that if the R. 
L. 
U. 
 differs radically only with the politi-cal views of the Osvobozhdeniye League, we can infer that it does not differ with its economic programme, in which case it explicitly renounces socialism and fully subscribes tothe views of the revolutionary bourgeois democrats! This deduction, of course, is at variance with the R. 
L. 
U. 
’s sym-pathies for a “strictly proletarian ideology”, but the essenceof a “non-party” stand consists precisely in the fact that it engenders endless and hopeless contradictions. 
 Secondly, what exactly is the radical difference between the political views of the R. 
L. 
U. 
 and the Osvobozhdeniye League? The R. 
L. 
U. 
 has just rapped its own knuckles; it hasspoken of “going along together to a Constituent Assembly”and “abandoning for a time party disputes and differences on points of principle” (obviously, until the Constituent Assembly is convened), and now, before the ConstituentAssembly, it precipitates a dispute and expresses its dis-agreement with the Osvobozhdeniye League, which adopted in its programme the convocation of a popular Constituent Assembly on democratic lines! How does it happen that the R. 
L. 
U. 
, while expressing a desire to “propagandise itspolitical convictions”, manages to say nothing on the contentof those convictions? Is the R. 
L. 
U. 
 a republican organisation,as distinct from the Osvobozhdeniye League, which is mon-archist? Do the political convictions of the R. 
L. 
U. 
 include, say, the abolition of the standing army and its replacement by the arming of the people? the demand for thecomplete disestablishment of the Church? the complete abo-lition of indirect taxes, etc. 
 ? In its desire to simplify and easethings by abandoning party disputes and fundamental differ-ences, the R. 
L. 
U. 
 has actually complicated and made things more difficult by the utter vagueness of its position. 
 Thirdly, how are we to know whether the Osvobozhdeniye League will fulfil the condition which the R. 
L. 
U. 
 has setit, whether it will “bring itself to realise the inevitabil-ity of the armed uprising”? Are we to wait for its officialannouncement on that score? But the Osvobozhdeniye League refuses to say anything about the methods by which its programme is to be carried out. 
 It gives its members fullscope both in the choice of those methods and in the matterof modifying the programme itself. 
 It considers itselfto be a part of the “Constitutional-Democratic” (readconstitutional-monarchist) party, whose other part forms the Zemstvo grouping which refuses to commit itself to any programme or to any tactics whatever. 
 This being the case,what does the condition set to the Osvobozhdeniye League by the R. 
L. 
U. 
 amount to? Further, who does not know that theOsvobozhdeniye adherents do not commit themselves to any definite programme or tactical line, in order to be completely free in certain cases to declare themselves (especially unofficially) both for terrorism and for theuprising? Hence, we arrive at the indubitable conclusionthat influential members and even influential groups ofthe League will experience no difficulty in joining, shouldthey wish to do so, the R. 
L. 
U. 
 and in occupying key posi-tions therein. 
 Given the R. 
L. 
U. 
’s non-party position, quite a number of circumstances beyond its control (large finan-cial resources, social connections, etc. 
) will favour such an outcome. 
 This outcome would mean the conversion of the armed fighting squads of the people into an instrument of the liberal bourgeoisie, the subjection of the workers’ up-rising to its interests. 
 It would mean the political exploita-tion of the proletariat by the bourgeoisie in the Russiandemocratic revolution. 
 In the event of such an outcome thebourgeoisie would furnish the money to arm the proletariat,taking care to divert the proletariat from socialism by preach-ing non-partisanship interests, to weaken its ties with So-cial-Democracy, and thus to render its own chances mostfavourable for using the workers as its tool and for deprivingthem of the possibilities to advance their own, “party”,proletarian interests in the revolution. 
 * * * The tactical tasks, which the appearance of this new union sets before the Social-Democrats, follow naturally from whathas been said above. 
 Whether this particular union, theR. 
L. 
U. 
, especially its C. 
C. 
, subject to no control and answerable to no one, merits confidence, we cannot say. 
 We shall not dwell on the C. 
C. 
 of the R. 
L. 
U. 
, but on the R. 
L. 
U. 
Workers’ Union, and not so much on this particular workers’union as on workers’ unions of this type in general. 
 Similar“unions”, organisations, groups, and circles in varying forms,under varying names, and of varying sizes, are today spring-ing up all over Russia. 
 The whole policy of the autocracy, which compels the people to resort to arms and prepare forthe uprising, inevitably stimulates the organisation of suchgroups. 
 The motley, often accidental, nature of their socialcomposition, with its indeterminate class character, inconjunction with an extremely limited scope of effective Social-Democratic work, inevitably lends these groups the character of non-party revolutionary-democratic groups. 
 Thepractical attitude of the Social-Democrats towards them isone of our Party’s most pressing problems. 
 We must, in the first place, decidedly use all means to make the Social-Democratic standpoint clear to the members of these groups, especially to the workers, without vagueness or reservation in the slightest, that the proletariat mustorganise definitely on a party basis and definitely in the Social-Democratic Party, if it does not wish to be politi-cally exploited by the bourgeoisie. 
 It would be sheer pedantry for us simply to dismiss these groups, or to “over-look” their formation and their tremendous importance forthe struggle for freedom. 
 It would be unpardonable doc-trinairism for the Social-Democrats to adopt a snobbish orcontemptuous attitude towards the “non-party” workersbelonging to such groups. 
 We should like in particular to warn all members of the Party against such mistakes, which are possible as a result of the revival of Economism ofrueful memory and a narrow, tail-ist interpretation of ourtasks in the ranks of Social-Democracy. 
 Every effort shouldbe made to effect a mutual exchange of assistance betweenthese groups and the organisations of our Party for the purpose of arming the greatest possible number of workers. 
 There should be an extremely discreet, tactful, and comradelyattitude towards the workers, who are ready to die forfreedom, who are organising and arming for the fight, whoare in complete sympathy with the proletarian struggle, andwho are yet divided from us by the lack of a Social-Democrat-ic world outlook, by anti-Marxist prejudices, and by sur-vivals of superannuated revolutionary views. 
 Nothing iseasier than the method of immediately breaking with suchotherwise-minded workers or of simply keeping aloof fromthem; nor is there anything more stupid than such a method. 
We should remember that Social-Democracy’s strength lies in the unity of the broad masses of the proletariat, and that such unity, owing to the splitting, disuniting, and dullingconditions of capitalism, is not achieved with immediacy,but only at the cost of persistent effort and tremendouspatience. 
 We should remember the experiences of our Euro-pean comrades, who consider it their duty to show an attitude of comradely concern even towards the workers who are mem-bers of the Catholic unions and try not to antagonise themby treating their religious and political prejudices withcontempt, but persistently, tactfully, and patiently makeuse of every act of the political and economic struggle inorder to enlighten them and bring them closer to the class-conscious proletariat on the ground of common struggle. 
 How much more careful should our attitude be towards theworker-revolutionaries, who are prepared to fight for freedom but are still strangers to Social-Democracy! We repeat: no concealment of Social-Democratic views, but no slighting of the revolutionary workers’ groups that do not share these views. 
 So long as these groups have not officially joined anynon-Social-Democratic party, we are entitled, nay, obligatedto regard them as associated with the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 Thus, too,we should regard the Workers’ Union of the Russian Libera-tion Union. 
 We should make every effort to introduce the members of this union to socialist literature and conduct propaganda of our views by word of mouth at all meetingsof all the branches of this union. 
 Even in the free coun-tries of Europe the idea that all proletarians can be madeclass-conscious Social-Democrats under capitalism is consid-ered utopian. 
 But neither in Europe nor in Russia is the idea of the Social-Democrats’ leading influence upon the mass of the proletariat considered utopian. 
 The thing isto learn how to exercise this influence, to remember thatour best ally in educating the unenlightened workers will beour enemies, the government and the bourgeoisie; then weshall be sure that, at the decisive moment, the whole work-ing-class mass will respond to the call of Social-Democracy! Proletary , No. 
 4, Published according to June 17 (4), 1905 the text in Proletary THE DEMOCRATIC TASKS OF THE REVOLUTIONARY PROLETARIAT 146 The Social-Democratic Party, as the conscious exponent of the working-class movement, aims at the complete libera-tion of the toiling masses from every form of oppression and exploitation. 
 The achievement of this objective—theabolition of private property in the means of productionand the creation of the socialist society—calls for a veryhigh development of the productive forces of capitalism anda high degree of organisation of the working class. 
 The full development of the productive forces in modern bourgeois society, a broad, free, and open class struggle, and thepolitical education, training, and rallying of the masses ofthe proletariat are inconceivable without political freedom. 
Therefore it has always been the aim of the class-consciousproletariat to wage a determined struggle for complete political freedom and the democratic revolution. 
 The proletariat is not alone in setting this task before itself. 
 The bourgeoisie, too, needs political freedom. 
 Theenlightened members of the propertied classes hung outthe banner of liberty long ago; the revolutionary intel-ligentsia, which comes mainly from these classes, has fought heroically for freedom. 
 But the bourgeoisie as a whole is incapable of waging a determined struggle against the autoc-racy; it fears to lose in this struggle its property whichbinds it to the existing order; it fears an all-too revolutionaryaction of the workers, who will not stop at the democraticrevolution but will aspire to the socialist revolution; it fears a complete break with officialdom, with the bureauc-racy, whose interests are bound up by a thousand ties withthe interests of the propertied classes. 
 For this reason the bourgeois struggle for liberty is notoriously timorous, inconsistent, and half-hearted. 
 One of the tasks of the proletariat is to prod the bourgeoisie on, to raise before the whole people slogans calling for a complete democraticrevolution, to start working boldly and independently for therealisation of these slogans—in a word, to be the vanguard,to take the lead in the struggle for the liberty of the wholepeople. 
 In the pursuit of this aim the Russian Social-Democrats have had to fight many a battle against the inconsistencyof bourgeois liberalism. 
 Let us recall, for instance, howMr. 
 Struve began his career, unhampered by the censor, asa political champion of the “liberation” of Russia. 
 Hemade his début with his preface to the Witte “Memorandum”, in which he advanced the markedly “Shipovian” (to use the current political nomenclature) slogan, “Rights, and anAuthoritative Zemstvo”. 
 The Social-Democratic Partyexposed the retrogressive, absurd, and reactionary nature ofthat slogan; it demanded a definite and uncompromisingdemocratic platform, and itself put forward such a platform as an integral part of its Party programme. 
 Social-Democ-racy had to combat the narrow conception of the aims ofdemocracy which obtained in its own ranks when the so-calledEconomists did their best to play down these aims, whenthey advocated the “economic struggle against the employersand the government”, and insisted that we must start by winning rights, continue with political agitation, and only then gradually (the theory of stages) pass on to politicalstruggle. 
 Now the political struggle has become vastly extended, the revolution has spread throughout the land, the mildestliberals have become “extremists”; it may therefore seem that historical references to the recent past such as we have just made are out of place, with no bearing on the actualturbulent present. 
 But this may seem so only at first glance. 
To be sure, such slogans as the demand for a ConstituentAssembly and for universal, direct, and equal suffrage bysecret ballot (which the Social-Democrats long since and in advance of all presented in their Party programme) have become common property; they have been adopted bythe illegal Osvobozhdeniye , incorporated in the programme of the Osvobozhdeniye League, turned into Zemstvo slogans, and are now being repeated in every shape and form by the legal press. 
 That Russian bourgeois democracy has made progress in recent years and months cannot be doubted. 
 Bourgeoisdemocracy is learning by experience, is discarding primitiveslogans (like the Shipovian “Rights, and an AuthoritativeZemstvo”) and is hobbling along behind the revolution. 
 Butit is only hobbling along behind; new contradictions between its words and its deeds, between democracy in principle and democracy in “ Realpolitik ”, are arising in place of the old; for revolutionary developments are making steadily growingdemands on democracy. 
 But bourgeois democracy alwaysdrags at the tail of events; while adopting more advanced slo-gans, it always lags behind; it always formulates the slogans several degrees below the level really required in the real revolutionary struggle for real liberty. 
 Indeed, let us take that now current and generally ac-cepted slogan, “For a Constituent Assembly on the basisof universal, direct, and equal suffrage by secret ballot”. 
Is that slogan adequate from the standpoint of consistent democracy? Is it adequate in the light of the urgent revo-lutionary tasks of the present moment? The answer to boththese questions can be only in the negative. 
 To be convincedthat this is so one has only to examine carefully ourParty programme, to which our organisations, unfortunately,do not often refer and which they quote and disseminate all too little. 
 (As a happy exception, worthy of the widest emulation, we note the recent reprint of our Party programmein leaflet form by the Riga, Voronezh, and Moscow commit-tees. 
) The keynote of our programme, too, is the demand fora popular Constituent Assembly (let us agree, for brevity’ssake, to use the word “popular” as denoting suffrage that is universal, etc. 
). 
 But this slogan does not stand isolated in our programme. 
 The context and the addenda and notesprevent any misconstruction on the part of those who areleast consistent in the struggle for liberty or who even strug-gle against it. 
 It occurs in our programme in conjunction withthe following other slogans: (1) the overthrow of the tsarist autocracy; (2) its replacement by the democratic republic ; (3) the sovereignty of the people , safeguarded by a demo-cratic constitution, i. 
e. 
, the concentration of supreme governmental authority entirely in the hands of a legislative assembly composed of representatives of the people and forming a single chamber. 
 Can there be any doubt that every consistent democrat is obligated to accept all these slogans? Why, the very word“democrat”, both by its etymology and by virtue of the polit-ical significance it has acquired throughout the history ofEurope, denotes an adherent of the sovereignty of the people. 
 It is absurd, therefore, to talk of democracy and in the same breath to reject even a single one of these slogans. 
But the main contradiction, the contradiction between thedesire of the bourgeoisie to preserve private property at allcosts and its desire for liberty, is so profound that spokes-men or followers of the liberal bourgeoisie inevitably find themselves in this ridiculous position. 
 As everyone knows, a very broad liberal party is forming itself in Russia withenormous rapidity, a party which has the adherence of theOsvobozhdeniye League, of the mass of the Zemstvo people, and of newspapers like Nasha Zhizn , Nashi Dni , Syn Otechestva , Russkiye Vedomosti , * etc. 
, etc. 
 This liberal-bourgeois party likes to be called the “Constitutional-Democratic” Party. 
 In actual fact, however, as can be seen from the declarationsand the programme of the illegal Osvobozhdeniye , it is a monarchist party. 
 It does not want a republic at all. 
 It does not want a unicameral assembly, and it proposes forthe Upper House indirect and virtually non-universal suffrage (residence qualification). 
 It is anything but anxious for the supreme governmental authority to pass entirely into the hands of the people (although for window-dressing pur-poses it is very fond of talking about the transfer of powerto the people). 
 It does not want the autocracy to be over-thrown . 
 It wants only a division of power among (1) the monarchy; (2) the Upper House (where landowners and capi-talists will predominate); and (3) the Lower House, whichalone is to be built on democratic principles. 
 Thus, we have before us the indisputable fact that our “democratic” bourgeoisie, even as represented by its mostadvanced, most educated elements, those least subject to *Our Life , Our Days , Son of the Fatherland , Russian Recorder . 
— Ed. 
 the direct influence of capital, is trailing behind the revo-lution. 
 This “democratic” party fears the sovereignty of the people. 
 While repeating our slogan of a popular Constituent Assembly, it in fact completely distorts itssense and significance and misleads the people by its use, or,rather, abuse. 
 What is a “popular Constituent” Assembly? It is an assembly which, in the first place, really expresses the will of the people. 
 To this end we must have universal suffrage in all of its democratic aspects, and a full guar-antee of freedom to conduct the election campaign. 
 It is anassembly which, in the second place, really has the power and authority to “inaugurate” a political order which will ensure the sovereignty of the people. 
 It is clear as day-light that without these two conditions the assembly can be neither truly popular nor truly constituent. 
 Yet our liberalbourgeois, our constitutional monarchists (whose claimto be democrats is a mockery of the people) do not wantreal safeguards to ensure either of these conditions! Not only do they fail to ensure in any way complete freedom of election propaganda or the actual transfer of power and authority to the Constituent Assembly, but, on the contrary,they seek to make both impossible since they aim at main-taining the monarchy. 
 The real power and authority is toremain in the hands of Nicholas the Bloody. 
 This meansthat the dire enemy of the people is to convene the assembly and “ensure” that the elections will be free and universal. 
 How very democratic! It means that the Constituent Assem-bly will never have and (according to the idea of the liberalbourgeois) must never have all power and all authority; itis to be utterly devoid of power, devoid of authority; itis merely to come to terms , to reach an agreement , to arrive at an understanding , to strike a bargain with Nicholas II for the assembly to be granted a modicum of his royal power!The Constituent Assembly elected by universal suffrage is todiffer in no way from a Lower House. 
 That is to say, theConstituent Assembly, convened for expressing and executingthe will of the people, is designed by the liberal bourgeoisie to “constitute”, over the will of the people , the will of an Upper House and on top of that the will of the monarchy,the will of Nicholas. 
 Is it not obvious that in talking, speechifying, and shouting about a popular Constituent Assembly, the liberal bourgeois, the Osvobozhdeniye gentry, are actually planning an anti-popular consultative assembly? Instead of emanci-pating the people, they want to subject the people, byconstitutional means, first, to the power of the tsar(monarchism), and, secondly, to the power of the organisedbig bourgeoisie (the Upper House). 
 If anyone wishes to dispute this conclusion, let him assert: (1) that there can be a true expression of the popularwill in elections without complete freedom of propagandaand without the actual abolition of all the propagandaprivileges of the tsarist government; or (2) that anassembly of delegates devoid of real power and authority, in that these are left in the hands of the tsar, is not, in effect, a mere consultative body. 
 To make either of theseassertions one must be either a brazen charlatan or ahopeless fool. 
 History proves conclusively that a representa-tive assembly coexisting with a monarchical form of gov-ernment is in actual fact, so long as governmental power remains in the hands of the monarchy, a consultative body which does not bend the will of the monarch to the will ofthe people, but only conforms the will of the people to the will of the monarch, i. 
e. 
, divides the power between monarchand people, bargains for a new order, but does not consti-tute it. 
 History proves conclusively that there can be no such thing as really free elections, that the significance and character of these elections can hardly be brought home tothe whole people unless the government that is combating the revolution is replaced by a provisional revolutionarygovernment. 
 Granting for a moment the improbable and theimpossible, namely, that the tsarist government, having de-cided to convene a “Constituent” (read: consultative) As-sembly, will give formal guarantees of freedom of propaganda, all the vast advantages and superior facilities for campaign-ing which accrue from the organised power of the statewill nevertheless remain in its hands. 
 These advantagesand facilities for propaganda during the elections to the first people’s assembly will be enjoyed by the very ones who have oppressed the people by all the means in their power, andfrom whom the people have begun to wrest liberty by force. 
 In a word, we arrive at the very conclusion we reached on the previous occasion ( Proletary , No. 
 3), * when we exam-ined this question from another angle. 
 The slogan of a popu-lar Constituent Assembly, taken by itself, separately, isat the present time a slogan of the monarchist bourgeoisie, aslogan calling for a deal between the bourgeoisie and thetsarist government. 
 Only the overthrow of the tsarist gov-ernment and its replacement by a provisional revolutionary government, whose duty it will be to convene the popular Con-stituent Assembly, can be the slogan of the revolutionarystruggle. 
 Let the proletariat of Russia have no illusionson this score; in the din of the general excitation it is beingdeceived by the use of its own slogans. 
 If we fail to matchthe armed force of the government with the force of an armed people, if the tsarist government is not utterly defeated and replaced by a provisional revolutionary government,every representative assembly, whatever title—“popular”,“constituent”, etc. 
—may be conferred upon it, will infact be an assembly of representatives of the big bourgeoisieconvened for the purpose of bargaining with the tsar for a division of power. 
 The more the people’s struggle against the tsar comes to a head and the greater likelihood there is of a speedy realisa-tion of the demand for an assembly of people’s representa-tives, the more closely must the revolutionary proletariatwatch the “democratic” bourgeoisie. 
 The sooner we gain free-dom, the sooner will this ally of the proletariat become its enemy. 
 Two circumstances will serve to cloak this change:(1) the vagueness, incompleteness, and non-committal charac-ter of the would-be democratic slogans of the bourgeoisie;and (2) the endeavour to turn the slogans of the proletariatinto mere phrases, to substitute empty promises for real safeguards of liberty and revolution. 
 The workers must now watch the “democrats” with intensified vigilance. 
 The words“popular Constituent Assembly” will be nothing more thanwords if, owing to the actual conditions under which theelection campaign and the elections themselves are conduct-ed, this assembly fails to express the will of the people, if it lacks the strength independently to establish the new order.

 The cardinal issue is now shifting from the question of summoning the popular Constituent Assembly to the ques-tion of the method by which it is to be summoned. 
 We are on the eve of decisive events. 
 The proletariat must not pinits faith in general democratic slogans but must contraposeto them its own proletarian-democratic slogans in their fullscope. 
 Only a force guided by these slogans can really ensurethe complete victory of the revolution. 
 Proletary , No. 
 4, Published according to June 17 (4), 1905 the text in Proletary THE FIRST STEPS OF BOURGEOIS BETRAYAL Geneva, Wednesday, June 21 (8) Yesterday the telegraph brought the news that Nicholas II had received a Zemstvo deputation last Monday. 
 Respond-ing to speeches by Prince Sergei Trubetskoi and Mr. 
 Fyodo-rov, the tsar emphatically confirmed his promise to convenean assembly of people’s representatives. 
 To appreciate fully the significance of this “event” we must first of all reconstruct certain facts that were reported in the foreign press. 
 On May 24 and 25, old style, about 300 Zemstvo and municipal representatives held three meetings in Moscow. 
 Inthe lithographed copies we have received from Russia oftheir petition to the tsar and of a resolution adopted by them the number of attending delegates is not indicated; mention is made only of City Mayors and Marshals of theNobility, as well as Zemstvo and municipal councillors,having attended the Conference. 
 The representatives oflandlordism and urban capital discussed the political fortunesof Russia. 
 According to the foreign correspondents, the debate was very heated. 
 The Shipov party, with its moderate policy and its extensive Court connections, enjoyed greatinfluence. 
 The most radical were the provincial delegates,the most moderate those from St. 
 Petersburg, while the“Centre” was formed by the Moscow delegates. 
 Every word ofthe petition was debated, St. 
 Petersburg finally joining in the vote for it. 
 The resulting document was a patriotic and loyal petition. 
 “Actuated solely by ardent love of country”,the respectable bourgeois gentlemen sink “all discord and all differences that divide them” and appeal to the tsar. 
 They point to “the grave danger to Russia and to the Throne itself”, which emanates not so much from abroad as from “internal strife”. 
 (True, “Russia” comes before the“Throne”, but our patriots appealed to the Throne first andonly threatened—privately and à la sourdine —to appeal to the people. 
) As usual, the petition is full of official eyewash:everything is blamed on the tsar’s councillors, on the dis-tortion of his designs and prescriptions which has led to a tightening of the police regime and prevented the “voiceof truth” from ascending to the Throne, etc. 
 They concludewith the request, “before it is too late”, that “representa-tives of the people elected for this purpose by all subjects onan equal basis, without any distinction, be convoked without delay”. 
 The representatives of the people are to decide the question of war or peace “in concert” with the tsar and to“establish [also in concert with the tsar] an improved system of government”. 
 Thus, the petition contains noexplicit demand for universal, direct, and equal suffrage bysecret ballot, which was alleged to have been adopted by the “Constitutional-Democratic” Party (all reference to direct suffrage and secret ballot is omitted and, of course, not byaccident); and no guarantees whatever are demanded toensure that the elections will be free. 
 The authors of thepetition state pathetically: “Oppression of the individual andof society, denial of free speech, and all manner of tyranny are multiplying and growing”; but no measures against them are suggested. 
 Tyranny is growing “in concert” withthe tsar; so let the political system be “improved” in concertwith the tsar.... 
 The representatives of the bourgeoisie areholding fast to the theory of an “agreement”, not, of course,on the part of the people, but on the part of the bourgeoisie, and the people’s oppressors. 
 The Conference elected a delegation to present the petition to the tsar. 
 It consisted of Messrs. 
 Heyden,Golovin, Petrunkevich, G. 
 and N. 
 Lvov, Pyotr and PavelDolgorukov, Kovalevsky, Novosiltsev, Rodichev, Shakhov-skoi, and Segrei Trubetskoi. 
 Later, at the audience given by Nicholas II, they were joined by Messrs. 
 Korf, Nikitin, and Fyodorov, from St. 
 Petersburg. 
 The Conference then adopted the following resolution , which was not reported in the foreign press but is reproduced in the Russian leaflet: “This Conference of united groups of Zemstvo and municipal repre-sentatives, imbued, notwithstanding differences of opinion on certain political questions, with the common conviction that the root cause of the present difficult position of Russia, domestic and foreign, is thestill existing system of government by decree, which denies individualand public freedom, represses the self-realisation and independent acti-vity of the people, debars the population from participation in the lifeof the state, and breeds unrestrained and constantly increasing lawless-ness on the part of an irresponsible administration; that this system of government, which for many years has been a source of violence, false-hood, and corruption in our internal life, has now led to the direthreat of grave external danger, by having involved the nation in adisastrous war, in the course of which it has engendered and sustainedinternecine strife, and brought the country to a series of defeats culmi-nating in a disaster to its naval forces unprecedented in Russian histo-ry;—and, firm in the conviction that the further existence of this re-gime menaces, not only the internal peace, the order, and the welfareof the people, but also the stability of the Throne and the territorialintegrity and external security of Russia, this Conference declares thatthe salvation of the country makes it imperatively necessary: “1. 
 That freely elected popular representatives be immediately convoked to decide, jointly with the Sovereign, the question of warand peace and of establishing a constitutional state system; “2. 
 That all laws, institutions, decisions, and orders which contra-vene the principles of personal liberty, freedom of speech, of the press,and of association and assembly, be immediately nullified, and that a political amnesty be proclaimed; “3. 
 That the administrative personnel be immediately renewed through the placement of the central administration in the charge ofpersons who are sincerely devoted to the cause of reforming the stateand who enjoy the confidence of the community. 
” We do not know in what relation this resolution stands to the petition and to the mandates of the delegation, whetherthe delegation undertook to set forth the substance of the resolution or to present it together with the petition. 
 Perhaps the petition is the official document for the“Throne”, and the resolution the unofficial document for the“people”? As regards the character of the debates at the Confer-ence, the correspondent of the French paper Le Matin , 147 M. 
 Gaston Leroux, reports that the most “progressive-mind-ed” of the delegates, those from the provincial Zemstvos,stood for a two-stage electoral system, fearing that under direct elections they would be overwhelmed by the “towns” (evidently they feared that under direct elections the privileges of the landlords over the peasants would not be fully guaranteed). 
 The correspondent of the Frankfurter Zeitung wrote: “The Russian Zemstvo as a political party consists of three groupings: the liberal Zemstvo majority (with Count Heyden as its leader), the moderately liberal nationalist-Slavophil Zemstvo minority headed by Mr. 
 Shipov, and the group of radical Zemstvo constitutionalists. 
 It is charac-teristic that at the election of delegates ... it was the ‘feu-dal’ candidates that got through. 
 The moderates wanted tobe worthily represented before the tsar by members ofrespected old families. 
 And the radicals, who entertained no illusions as to the outcome of the petition, wanted the representatives of the old families to see with their owneyes that the government would not yield an inch voluntar-ily. 
” The conveniences of that nebulous organisation of the “Constitutional-Democratic” (read: monarchist) party eulo-gised by Mr. 
 Struve were not long in revealing themselves in practice. 
 A strong, firmly knit party organisation willnot lend itself to dickering and bargaining, to dodges andsubterfuges. 
 Let the “party” include both the Osvobozhdeniye League (perhaps this is the “group of radicals” mentionedby the correspondent of the Frankfurter Zeitung ) and the “Zemstvo group” (i. 
e. 
, the followers of Heyden and of Shipov, from whom Mr. 
 Struve is now officially seeking to dissociate himself). 
 But the Zemstvo group includes theHeydenists, the Shipovists, and ... the “radicals”. 
 Work thisout if you can! But they are all agreed, moved as they wereby ardent love for their country and for the privileges of the bourgeois, on the theory of agreement , with which we have often dealt in Proletary , and which is clearly in evidence both in the “petition” and in the “resolution”. 
 The resolution was probably designed to satisfy the “ideal” demands of the radicals, while the petition, asinterpreted by the “moderate” delegates, was to serve the purpose of a material deal with tsarism. 
 Such things as the numerical representation of the groupings at the Con-ference, the powers of the delegates, the terms of the deal, and the further intentions of the Zemstvo men were very care-fully concealed from the uninitiated plebs. 
 The “people”, in whose name the bourgeois gentlemen are bargaining with tsarism, have no need to know the high politics of the “Con-stitutional-Democratic Party”! The bourgeois gentlemen will converse with the tsar about the suppression of free speechand the voice of truth, about people ’s representatives, about a Russia that has “rallied round the one standard of the people ”, etc. 
; but for this people to know the whole truth about the policy pursued by the liberal and Osvobozhdeniye hagglers is quite superfluous.... 
 Indeed, not without reason did Mr. 
 Struve,in Osvobozhdeniye , recently reproach the “extreme parties” (the Social-Democrats in particular) for their immoderateleaning to narrow, conspiratorial, Jacobin “secrecy”. 
 We Social-Democrats resort to secrecy from the tsar and his blood-hounds, while taking pains that the people should know every-thing about our Party, about the shades of opinion withinit, about the development of its programme and policy, thatthey should even know what this or that Party congress del-egate said at the congress in question. 
 The enlightened bourgeois of the Osvobozhdeniye fraternity surround them-selves with secrecy ... from the people, who know nothingdefinite about the much-talked-of “Constitutional-Democrat-ic” Party; but they make up for this by taking the tsar andhis sleuths into their confidence. 
 Who can say they arenot democrats? What secrets the Zemstvo delegates unbosomed to the Court cabal, who refused to admit them to the tsar, we donot know. 
 But the confidences and talks continued for quitea while. 
 The foreign press was agog for news about thedelegates’ every step in the game of “high politics”. 
 St. 
 Peters-burg, June 9 (May 27): The Zemstvo deputation will in the first place see Mr. 
 Bulygin, Minister of the Interior, in order to lodge a complaint against Trepov. 
 June 10 (May 28):Bulygin told the deputation that it would not bereceived by the tsar and advised it to leave St. 
 Petersburg. 
-June 12 (May 30): It is thought probable that the tsar willreceive the deputation. 
 June 15 (2): A special telegram from M. 
 Gaston Leroux to Le Matin : “The Zemstvo delegates have accepted the conditions set by the Minister of the Courtfor an audience with the Emperor . 
 There upon Baron Fred-ericks went this evening to Tsarskoye Selo to inquire of the tsar whether he had decided to receive the deputation. 
” Do you hear this, Russian workers and peasants? This is how they behave, these “liberationists” and “democrats”,these foes of conspiracy, these abhorrers of secrecy! Theyconspire with the Minister of the Court of His PolicemanicMajesty, hugger-mugger with the spies against the people. 
They pose as the representatives of the “people”, while accepting conditions framed by spies on how to speak with a tsar on the needs of the “people”! This is how they act, the rich, independent, enlightened, and liberal-minded patriots who are “actuated by ardentlove of country”. 
 How unlike the rough unschooled working-class rabble, dependent on every clerk, which tries to push its way straight to the tsar without any concealment, led by an audacious priest, without having even talked with theinfluential spies about the conditions of an interview withthe tsar. 
 How can one think of a republic, or even of directelections or of a unicameral system with such politicallyuneducated masses? The politically educated know the ropes and understand that one should first make a backstairs call on the spies—perhaps even consult them as to thesubstance and style of the petition to the tsar—after whichthe “voice of truth” will surely “ascend to the Throne”. 
 What sort of bargain the “representatives [save the mark!] of the people” struck with the tsar’s spies we do not know. 
 We know from the telegrams that at the reception of the delegation Prince Trubetskoi delivered “a lengthyspeech” in which, for half an hour, he described to the tsarthe plight of Russia and the conditions that had compelledthe Zemstvo men to appeal directly to the tsar (and notthrough his spies?). 
 The speech made a profound impression upon the tsar. 
 Mr. 
 Fyodorov spoke on behalf of the repre-sentatives of St. 
 Petersburg. 
 The tsar responded with along speech. 
 He expressed regret at the enormous sacrificescaused by the war, lamented the latest defeat at sea, andconcluded with the words: “I thank you, gentlemen, for the sentiments you have expressed [fine sentiments they must have been, considering that the “democrat” Trubets-koi had consulted the spies on how to express them!]I believe in your desire to work with me [the tsar believes the liberal bourgeoisie; the liberal bourgeoisie believes the tsar; claw me—claw thee] in setting up a new system of government built on new principles. 
 My desire to convene a popular assembly [When? Are the representatives to beelected? If so, in what manner and by whom? This is notknown. 
 Evidently Mr. 
 Trubetskoi concealed from hisbeloved sovereign the “resolution” of the conference; thespies must have advised him not to broach this subject to the tsar!] is unshakable. 
 It is daily in my thoughts. 
 My will shall be carried out. 
 You may announce this to thepopulation of town and countryside this very day. 
 Youwill help me in this new work. 
 The popular assembly willrestore unity between Russia and its emperor [between theTrubetskois and Fyodorovs and the emperor?]. 
 It will lay the foundation of the system which will repose on Russian national principles. 
” The delegates—says the officialtelegram—came away from the audience tremendouslyimpressed. 
 The tsar seemed pleased, too.... 
 This does look like the real truth! The tsar is pleased, the liberal bourgeois are pleased. 
 They are ready to conclude a lasting peace with one another. 
 The autocracy and the police (the true Russian national principles) are pleased. 
The money-bags as well are pleased (from now on theiradvice will be sought constantly and regularly). 
 But will the workers and peasants be pleased—they whose interests the bourgeois traitors are bartering away? Proletary , No. 
 5, Published according to June 26 (13), 1905 the text in Proletary “REVOLUTIONARIES ” IN KID GLOVES Friday, June 23 (10) The press abroad has begun to comment on the audience granted to the Zemstvo deputation by the tsar. 
 As usual, the bourgeois press fawns, waxing sentimental over the tsar’s amenability and the reasonableness of the Zemstvorepresentatives, though certain doubts creep in as to thevalue of promises given in so vague a form. 
 The socialistpapers bluntly and definitely declare that the audience wasa farce. 
 The autocracy is playing for time and leading the liberal bourgeoisie by the nose. 
 On the one hand, dictatorialpowers for Trepov; on the other, meaningless and worthlesspromises to the liberals in order to cause further vacillationin their all-too vacillating ranks. 
 The tactics of the autocraticgovernment are not so stupid. 
 The liberals are playing at loyalty, moderation, and modesty. 
 Why should not the government take advantage of their stupidity and cowar-dice? “ A la guerre comme à la guerre . 
” There are no wars without military stratagems. 
 And when the “enemy” (the lib-eral bourgeoisie) is something between a foe and a gulliblefriend, why not lead him by the nose? M. 
 Gaston Leroux, referred to in our leading article, reports the following details concerning the audience,details which, though not very authentic, are at any ratecharacteristic and significant. 
 “Baron Fredericks, Minister ofthe Court, told the delegates that, with the best of inten-tions, it was difficult for him to obtain an imperial audience for Mr. 
 Petrunkevich, who was said to have revolutionary connections. 
 It was pointed out to the Minister that theAustrian Emperor had had among his Ministers M. 
 Andrássy, who had at one time been sentenced. 
 This argument removed the last difficulty and the delegates ... were conducted to the Court. 
” The argument is a good one. 
 The West-European bour-geoisie did fight in earnest at first; at times it was evenrepublican, its leaders were “sentenced”—sentenced for trea-son, i. 
e. 
, not only for revolutionary connections, but for actual revolutionary deeds . 
 Then, many years, sometimes decades, later these bourgeois accommodated themselves to the most wretched of skimpy constitutions without a republic andwithout even universal suffrage or real political freedom. 
The liberal bourgeois became fully reconciled to “the Throne”and the police; they rose to power themselves andbrutally suppressed, as they do to this day, every aspiration of the workers towards freedom and social reforms. 
 Russia’s liberal bourgeoisie wants to combine pleasure with profit. 
 To be regarded as a man with “revolutionary connections” is pleasant; to be capable of occupying aministerial seat under the Emperor Nicholas the Bloodyis profitable. 
 The bourgeois liberals of Russia have no desire whatever to risk “being sentenced” for treason. 
 They prefer the direct leap into the stage in which ex-revolutionaries like Andrássy became Ministers onthe side of law and order. 
 In 1848 Count Andrássy hadtaken such an energetic part in the revolutionary move-ment that, after the suppression of the revolution, he was sentenced to death and hanged in effigy . 
 He lived as an émigré in France and in England, and he did not returnto Hungary until after the amnesty of 1857. 
 That is whenhis “ministerial” career began. 
 The Russian liberals do notwant a revolution; they dread it; they want to be acceptedas ex-revolutionaries straight away, without ever having been revolutionaries! They want to leap from 1847 into 1857 at a single bound! They want to make a deal with thetsar straight away for a constitution like those operatingin Europe during the violent reaction which followed thedefeat of the Revolution of 1848. 
 Indeed, the example of Andrássy was an ideal choice. 
 As the sun is reflected in a tiny drop of water, so the parallel be-tween the bourgeois democracy of Europe, once revolutionaryand republican, and the monarchist constitutionalist (even after January 9, 1905) bourgeois “democracy” of Rus-sia is reflected in the comparison between Andrássy and Petrunkevich. 
 First the European bourgeois fought on the barricades for the republic, then they lived in exile, andthey ended up by turning traitors to the cause of liberty,betraying the revolution, and taking service with the con-stitutional monarchs. 
 The Russian bourgeois want to “learnfrom history” and “reduce the stages of development”: they want to betray the revolution straight away, to turn traitor to liberty straight away. 
 In private conversation they repeatthe words of Christ to Judas: “That thou doest, do quickly. 
” “They were ushered into another hall, ... where the tsar was to receive them,” continues M. 
 Gaston Leroux, “whenit was suddenly discovered that the revolutionary Petrunke-vich had no kid gloves. 
 Colonel of the Life Guards Putyatin instantly took off his own and hastily handed them to therevolutionary. 
” The audience began. 
 Prince Trubetskoi delivered his speech. 
 As reported by M. 
 Gaston Leroux, he began by stat-ing how grateful they were to the tsar for having “deigned to receive us, thereby proving your confidence in us.... 
 We are simply people of peace and order,” declared Prince Tru-betskoi (on behalf of the whole “Constitutional-Democrat-ic”, or Osvobozhdeniye , Party), adding that “the tsar had been deceived” by his councillors. 
 The most “daring” passagein his speech was the one in which he declared that an assembly of representatives based on social-estates, as proposed by Bulygin, was “ inadmissible ” ... why, you think? ... because “You, Your Majesty, are not the Tsar of thenobles, of the merchants and the peasants; you are the Tsar ofAll the Russias, and the representation must be of the entirepeople without exception”. 
 As to the resolution of the Zemstvo Conference, which we publish in our leading article, * o f that not a whisper , as was only to be expected. 
 Mr. 
 Fyodorov dealt in his speech with the financial side ... of the “revolution in kid gloves”. 
 The national budget wouldincrease after the war by an amount ranging from threehundred to four hundred millions; “an enormous exertion for progress and civilisation” will be necessary, and this, *See pp. 
 520-21 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR requires the “independence of society” and the “call to life of all men of talent among the people” (chosen under the con-trol of Trepov?). 
 The tsar’s answer we know. 
 “His speech over,” telegraphs M. 
 Gaston Leroux, “the tsar conversed amiably with eachmember of the deputation. 
 He went so far as to ask thefamous revolutionary [Petrunkevich] if he was a Marshalof the Nobility. 
 The latter replying in the negative, the tsar expressed the hope that the day would come when he would attain that rank and passed on to another delegate. 
 Whenhe had taken leave of the company, the delegates wereushered into a back room in the palace, where they wereserved a lunch, which, they estimated, might cost 75 kopeks. 
In any case, the delegates were pleased with the outcome. 
 [If not at once a ministerial portfolio, at least the post of Marshal of the Nobility had been promised! Even András-sy must have started as a Marshal of the Nobility, orsomething of the sort!] They had begun dispatching innu-merable telegrams [to the effect that confidence between thetsar and the “people” had now been restored?] ... when they received the official text of the tsar’s reply. 
 Great was their stupefaction when they failed to find in it the only impor-tant sentence that seemed to promise at least something. 
 Thewords: ‘Our imperial will to convene representatives of thepeople is unshakable’ was changed to the simple affirmation:‘Our imperial will is unshakable. 
’ The delegates immediately returned this official text as unacceptable. 
 Today, not without impatience, they looked forward to receiving atext that would contain the words they all had heard. 
 Oneof the deputies told me tonight [the telegram of M. 
 Lerouxis dated June 20 (7)] with reference to this fantastic manipu-lation of sentences: This is no longer an autocracy, it’s hocus-pocus. 
” Well put, or well invented, if M. 
 Leroux invented it all. 
 There is hocus-pocus in it even if the promise to convenethe popular representatives had been included in the officialtext of the speech. 
 Kid gloves, and a flunkey’s at that, arethe true emblem of the political act performed by the Petrun-keviches and the Rodichevs. 
 They started with hocus-pocus themselves, not only by accepting the terms of the audience,but by hiding their resolution in their pockets, by concealing their real wishes, and by most improperly misrepresent-ing the tsar as a victim of deception, etc. 
, etc. 
 They have no right to complain now that their trickery was answered with trickery. 
 For a general promise to convene representa-tives of the people means absolutely nothing and yieldsabsolutely nothing while leaving a clear field for a Bulyginand Trepov “constitution”, and ample opportunity forprocrastination of every description. 
 Everything remains as it was, except that the liberals, fooled like schoolboys, and disgraced by the promise of a Marshal’s rank, have done aservice to the autocracy by dispatching telegrams hailing thereturn of “confidence” and making reports about the audiencelike Mr. 
 Nikitin’s in the St. 
 Petersburg municipal council. 
 We should not like to assume the role of Cassandra. 
 148 We should not like to prophesy a ludicrous and ignoble endfor the Russian revolution. 
 But it is our duty to tell theworker, bluntly and openly, to tell the whole people thatthings are heading that way. 
 The Constitutional would-beDemocratic Party and all these gentlemen of Osvobozhdeniye are bringing matters to such an end and to no other. 
 Do not be deceived by the claptrap of the radical-Osvobozhdeniye speeches and the Zemstvo resolutions. 
 This is the gaudilypainted stage set for the “people”, while a brisk trade isgoing on behind the scenes. 
 The liberal bourgeoisie knowshow to cast parts: the radical spellbinders are sent to speech-ify at banquets and meetings, while the hard-boiled businessmen are sent to “prepare the ground” among the Court clique. 
 And since the power remains perfectly intactand unlimited in the hands of the autocracy, the inevitableresult of such a course of development will be a “constitu-tion” a hundred times more like the Bulygin scheme thanthat of Osvobozhdeniye . 
 The destiny of the Russian revolution now rests with the proletariat. 
 Only the proletariat can put a stop to thishaggling. 
 Only the proletariat can, by a new heroic effort,rouse the masses, split the wavering army, win over the peas-antry, and, arms in hand, gain freedom for the whole people byruthlessly crushing the enemies of liberty and hurling aside its self-seeking and wavering bourgeois bell-ringers.

 5, Published according to June 26 (13), 1905 the text in Proletary OPEN LETTER TO THE EDITORIAL BOARD OF THE LEIPZIGER VOLKSZEITUNG149 Dear Comrades, In issue No. 
 135 of the Leipziger Volkszeitung Comrade Karl Kautsky writes on the split in the Russian Social-Democracy. 
 We feel compelled to ask that you publish our replyto Kautsky’s attacks and to allow us to refute the factualinaccuracies which his article contains. 
 We shall be brief. 
 Kautsky says that “the German edition of the resolutions adopted at the recent Russian Congress could not haveappeared at a more inopportune moment”, that the resolutions“will give most readers a totally false picture of the rela-tions that exist in the Russian Social-Democracy”. 
 Kautsky goes so far as to propose to the German comrades that they should not make these resolutions public. 
 We take the liberty of pointing out that nothing could give our German comrades a better idea of the relationswithin the Russian Social-Democracy than the originalresolutions of the Third Congress of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, as well as the resolutions of the “conference” held by the new-Iskrists. 
 We declare that Kautsky is making a great mistake in writing on matters of which, at best, he knows only by hear-say, and that his picture of the relations that exist in theRussian Social-Democracy is a highly distorted one. 
 It is utterly ridiculous, for instance, to hear Kautsky suggest that “the resolutions [of the Third Congress of theR. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
] may have lost their significance at the present moment even for those who drafted * them”. 
 Many unity negotiations between us and the new-Iskrists have been held in the course of the past two or three months, but the outcome of these negotiations so far has amounted tonothing. 
 We strongly protest against the attempt to silence us in the German Social-Democratic press by means of such acrude, mechanical, and unheard-of method as boycotting a pamphlet which contains only a translation of the resolu-tions of the Third Congress of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 and whichwas issued by the Munich Party publishing house of theSocial-Democratic Labour Party of Germany (G. 
 Birk & Co. 
). 
Kautsky has no right to speak about his impartiality. 
 Hehas always been partial as regards the present struggle within the Russian Social-Democracy. 
 This is his right, of course. 
 But one who is partial would do better not to speaktoo much of impartiality, if he does not want to be accusedof hypocrisy. 
 Kautsky tries to make out that all the resolutions of the Third Congress of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 are “attacks by Lenin and his friends against Plekhanov and his friends”. 
 We have three brief remarks to make on this score. 
 In the first place,only four of the seventeen resolutions directly or indirectlytouch on our opponents within the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 Secondly,Plekhanov has now retired from the Editorial Board ofIskra (see Iskra , No. 
 101). 
 This shows how little Kautsky understands our relations. 
 Thirdly, we would ask the German comrades to consider the impression that is likely to becreated on the Russian Social-Democrats when a man withKautsky’s authority tries to discredit the work of an entireParty Congress by “representing” it as “attacks by Leninand his friends”. 
 What would people in Germany think of men who (without having read the record of the proceedings) presumed to represent the deliberations, say, of the DresdenParty Congress as an attack by Kautsky and his friends...? A word of warning to all the German Social-Democrats: Comrades! If you really consider the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 to bea fraternal party, do not believe a word of what the so-called impartial Germans tell you about our split. 
 Insist on seeing *Misprinted “hated” in the Leipziger Volkszeitung .

 And do not forget that prejudice is further from the truth than ignorance.

 THE STRUGGLE OF THE PROLETARIAT AND THE SERVILITY OF THE BOURGEOISIE An uprising and armed barricade fighting in Lodz, a bloody affray in Ivanovo-Voznesensk, general strikes and shooting at workers in Warsaw and Odessa, the ignominiousend of the Zemstvo deputation farce—such are the majorpolitical events of the past week. 
 If we add to this what theGeneva papers report today (June 28 [15]) concerning peas-ant disturbances in Lebedin Uyezd, Kharkov Gubernia, the pillaging of five estates, and the dispatch of troops to these places, we see, reflected in the events of a single week, thecharacter of all the main social forces, which is now soopenly and clearly revealing itself in the course of the revo-lution. 
 The proletariat has been in a constant state of unrest, especially since the Ninth of January, never giving the enemy a moment’s respite. 
 It is keeping up its offensivemainly in the form of strikes, while avoiding direct clasheswith the armed forces of tsarism and preparing its forcesfor the great and decisive battle. 
 In the industrially moredeveloped areas, where the workers are better trained politi-cally and where national oppression is added to the economic and general political yoke, the tsarist police and troopsare going out of their way to incense and provoke the workers. 
And the workers, even those who are unprepared for thestruggle, even those who at first confined themselves todefence, are now, through the proletariat of Lodz, setting a new example, not only of revolutionary enthusiasm and heroism, but of superior forms of struggle. 
 They arestill poorly, very poorly armed, and their uprising is still local, isolated from the general movement; nevertheless, they are making a step forward, they are covering the city streets with scores of barricades thrown up with amazing speed, they are inflicting serious losses on the tsarist troops,they are putting up a desperate resistance in some of thehouses. 
 The armed uprising is gaining in breadth and inten-sity. 
 The new victims of the tsar’s executioners—nearly2,000 people have been killed or wounded in Lodz—are kindling intense hatred towards the accursed autocracy in the hearts of hundreds of thousands of citizens. 
 The newarmed clashes demonstrate more and more strikingly thatthe decisive armed struggle of the people against the armedforces of tsarism is inevitable. 
 All these separate outbreaksform more and more distinctly the picture of a widespread all-Russian conflagration. 
 More and more districts, even the most backward, are being drawn into the proletarian strug-gle, and the zeal of the tsar’s myrmidons but serves the revo-lution by turning economic conflicts into political conflicts,by making the workers everywhere realise from their own hardlot that the autocracy must be overthrown at all costs, and by making of them future heroes and fighters of the popular uprising. 
 Armed uprising of the people! This is the slogan—advanced so resolutely by the party of the proletariat, as representedby the Third Congress of the Russian Social-DemocraticLabour Party—which the very course of events, the sponta-neous process of expansion and intensification of the revolu-tionary movement, powerfully impels. 
 Away, then, withall doubts and vacillations. 
 Let it be realised by one and all,now and without delay, how absurd and discreditable areall pretexts today for evading this urgent task of the mostenergetic preparation of the armed uprising—how perilous it is to delay, how vital it is to unite and co-ordinate the local uprisings which are breaking out all over thecountry. 
 Taken separately, these outbreaks are ineffectual. 
The organised force of the tsarist government can crush theinsurgents group by group, if the movement continues to spreadfrom town to town and from district to district as slowly and sporadically as it has been doing until now. 
 But united, these outbreaks can converge into a mighty torrent of revo-lutionary flame, which no power on earth will be able to withstand. 
 This unity is on the way, it is coming by a thou-sand paths we do not know of or even suspect. 
 These sporadic outbreaks and skirmishes are giving the people a lesson in revolution, and our job is never to lag behind the exigenciesof the moment, but to be able always to point to the next,higher stage of the struggle, deriving experience and instruc-tion from the past and from the present, and urging theworkers and peasants on and on more boldly and more broad-ly to the complete victory of the people, to the complete destruction of the autocratic gang that is now fighting withthe desperation of the doomed. 
 How often we would find people in the Social-Democratic movement, particularly in its intellectualist wing, whobelittled the aims of the movement, faint-hearts who have lost faith in the revolutionary energy of the working class. 
 Even now some think that because the democratic revolu-tion is bourgeois by its social and economic nature, theproletariat should not aspire to enact the leading role in therevolution, to take the most energetic part in it, or to putforward such advanced slogans as the overthrow of the tsar-ist regime and the establishment of a provisional revolu-tionary government. 
 Events are teaching even these politi-cally backward people. 
 Events are bearing out the militantconclusions that follow from the revolutionary theory ofMarxism. 
 The bourgeois nature of the democratic revolutiondoes not mean that this revolution can benefit only the bour-geoisie. 
 On the contrary, it is advantageous most of all, and necessary most of all, to the proletariat and the peas-antry. 
 Events are making it increasingly clear that onlythe proletariat is capable of waging a determined strugglefor complete liberty, for the republic, in contradistinc-tion to the unreliability and instability of the bourgeoisie. 
 The proletariat can become the leader of the entire people and win over the peasantry, which can expect nothing fromthe autocracy except oppression and violence, and nothingfrom the bourgeois friends of the people except betrayaland treachery. 
 Because of its class position in modern society,the proletariat can understand, sooner than any other class, that, in the final analysis, great historic issues are decided only by force, that freedom cannot be achievedwithout tremendous sacrifices, that the armed resistance of tsarism must be broken and crushed by force of arms. 
 Otherwise we shall never live to see liberty, otherwise Rus-sia will meet the fate of Turkey—a long painful decline and disintegration, particularly painful for all the toiling andexploited masses of the people. 
 Let the bourgeoisie abaseitself and cringe, let it bargain and beg for sops, for awretched travesty of liberty. 
 The proletariat will go intoaction and lead with it the peasantry, which suffers under the vilest and most intolerable conditions of serfdom and humiliation; it will march forward to complete liberty, whichcan be made secure only by an armed people basing itselfupon revolutionary power. 
 Social-Democracy has not advanced the slogan of insurrec-tion on the spur of the moment. 
 It has always fought, and will continue to fight, against revolutionary phrase-monger-ing, and it will always demand a sober estimation of forcesand an analysis of the given situation. 
 The Social-DemocraticParty has ever since 1902 spoken of preparing the uprising,without ever confounding this work of preparationwith the senseless artificial improvisation of rebellions which would merely dissipate our forces uselessly. 
 And only now, after the Ninth of January, has the workers’party placed the slogan of insurrection on the order of theday, only now has the necessity of the uprising and theurgency of mobilising for it been recognised. 
 The autocracyitself has made this slogan a practical slogan of the work-ing-class movement. 
 The autocracy has given the broad masses their first lessons in civil war. 
 This war has begun, andit is being fought on an increasingly wider front and withincreasing intensity. 
 We have only to generalise its lessons,to explain the great significance of the words “civil war”,to derive practical guidance from each encounter in this war, to organise our forces and prepare directly and imme-diately all that is necessary for a real war. 
 Social-Democracy does not fear to face the truth. 
 It knows the treacherous nature of the bourgeoisie. 
 It knows thatliberty will bring the workers, not tranquillity and peace,but the new and still greater struggle for socialism, a struggle against the present bourgeois friends of freedom. 
 But in spite of this—indeed, because of this—freedom is absolutelynecessary to the workers, more necessary to them than to anyone else. 
 Only the workers are capable of fighting at the head of the people for complete freedom, for a democratic republic. 
 And they will fight for it to the death. 
 Needless to say, ignorance and degradation are still wide-spread among the people; a good deal has yet to be doneto develop the class-consciousness of the workers, not tospeak of the peasantry. 
 But see how quickly the slave ofyesterday is straightening his back, how the spark of liberty is gleaming even in his half-dimmed eyes. 
 Look at the peasant movement. 
 It lacks unity and political consciousness,and we have only a faint inkling of its magnitude and itscharacter. 
 But one thing we know: the class-consciousworker and the peasant who is rising to the struggle willunderstand each other upon the first exchange of words, every ray of light will bring them closer together in the struggle for freedom; they will then not surrender their revolution to the contemptibly pusillanimous and selfish bourgeoisand landlords—their democratic revolution which can givethem land and freedom, which can give the working peopleevery alleviation of their living conditions conceivable in bourgeois society to enable them to continue the struggle for socialism. 
 We need but look at the central industrialregion. 
 How long is it since we thought it to be sunk in deepslumber? How long is it since only a sporadic, partial, pettytrade union movement was considered possible there? Andnow a general strike has broken out in that region. 
 In the hundreds of thousands they have risen there, and more are rising. 
 Political agitation is spreading as never before. 
 Tobe sure, the workers there are still far behind the heroicproletariat of heroic Poland, but the tsarist government isfast educating them; it is fast making them “catch up withPoland”. 
 No, the general armed uprising of the people is no dream. 
 The complete victory of the proletariat and the peasantryin this democratic revolution is no idle thought. 
 And whatgreat perspectives such a victory would open before theEuropean proletariat, which for so many years has beenartificially held back from the pursuit of happiness by the reactionary militarists and landlords! The victory of the democratic revolution in Russia will be the signal for thebeginning of the socialist revolution, for a new victory of our brothers, the class-conscious proletarians of all coun-tries. 
 How utterly contemptible, as compared with the mighty and heroic struggle of the proletariat, was the exhibition ofloyalty displayed by the Zemstvo men and the Osvobo-zhdeniye gentry at the famous audience granted by Nicholas II. 
 These mountebanks got their deserts. 
 Before the ink haddried on their grovelling and rapturous reports of the tsar’s gracious words, the true meaning of those words was revealed to all in new deeds. 
 The censorship is on therampage. 
 The newspaper Rus 151 has been suspended solely for publishing a more than moderate address. 
 The police dicta-torship headed by Trepov is in its hey day. 
 The tsar’s wordsare officially interpreted as a promise to call a consulta-tive assembly of representatives of the people, with the ancient autocracy “rooted in the native soil” remaininginviolate. 
 Prince Meshchersky’s opinion of the reception, published in Grazhdanin , proved to be right. 
 Nicholas knew how to donner le change to the Zemstvo men and the liberals, he wrote. 
 Nicholas knew how to lead them by the nose ! The gospel truth! The leaders of the Zemstvo people and of the Osvobozhdeniye crowd have been led by the nose. 
 It serves them right. 
 They got what they deserved for theirservile speeches, for their concealment of their true deci-sions and ideas on the constitution, and for their shameful silence after the tsar’s jesuitical speech. 
 They have haggled for a parody of freedom that will be “safe” for the bourgeoi-sie. 
 All have haggled—Shipov with Bulygin, Trubetskoiwith Shipov, Petrunkevich and Rodichev with Trubetskoi,and Struve with Petrunkevich and Rodichev. 
 They arehaggling while agreeing “provisionally” to the purely Shipo-vian programme of the Zemstvo delegation. 
 These hucksters got what they asked for—a kick from the military jackboot. 
 Surely, this humiliation of the leaders of the Russian bourgeois Osvobozhdeniye trend should mark the beginning of the end I Surely, those who have the making of sincere andhonest democrats will now at last turn their backs on that notorious Constitutional-Democratic Party. 
 Surely they ought to realise that they are hopelessly disgracing them-selves and betraying the cause of the revolution by support-ing a “party”, the “Zemstvo group” of which crawls on its belly before the autocracy, while the Osvobozhdeniye League repeats the like before the Zemstvo group. 
 We greet the finale of the Zemstvo deputation. 
 The mask has been torn off. 
 Choose, gentlemen of the landowningclasses and of the bourgeoisie! Choose, gentlemen of educa-tion and members of “leagues” of every description: forrevolution or for counter-revolution? for freedom or against freedom? He who would be a true democrat must fight, he must break with the grovellers and traitors, he must createan honest party that will have respect for itself and forits convictions, he must take his stand firmly and irrevo-cably on the side of the armed uprising. 
 As for those whowant to continue the game of diplomatising, of withholding their true opinions, who want to bargain and cringe, to make rhetorical threats believed by none and to go into rapturesat the promise of a post of Marshal of the Nobility from thedeified sovereign—as for such, let them be publicly brandedwith the unanimous contempt of all believers in freedom. 
 Down with the bourgeois betrayers of freedom! Long live the revolutionary proletariat! Long live the armed uprising for complete freedom, for the republic, forthe vital, urgent interests of the proletariat and the peas-antry! Proletary , No. 
 6, Published according to July 3 (June 20), 1905 the text in Proletary A THIRD STEP BACK All comrades know from the resolutions of the Third Con-gress of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party what our attitude should be, in point of principle and organisa-tion, towards the so-called Minority, or the new-Iskrists. 
While recognising the need for an ideological struggleagainst the survivals of “Economism”, the Third Congressruled that adherents of the Minority may be admitted tomembership in Party organisations, provided they recognise the congresses of the Party and submit to Party discipline. 
 Since this condition has not been met, all “Minority” groupsmust be regarded as being outside the Party. 
 Practicalagreements may, of course, be concluded with them at the discretion of the Central Committee and the local commit-tees, along the same lines as the agreements with the Bund, etc. 
 At present all we can give the comrades is some informa-tion regarding the section abroad of the seceded Minority. 
Immediately after the Congress the C. 
C. 
 wrote to the“League”, as well as to the heads of the technical and financialdepartments of the Party, asking the former to state its attitude to the Third Congress, and the latter to turn over the Party property to the C. 
C. 
 No reply was received to eitherof the letters. 
 The new-Iskrists were not averse to usingthe Party printing-house and store, and to receiving moneyfrom the German Social-Democratic Party and from abroadin general, in the name of the entire Party; but they showed no desire to account to the Party for the use of Party property and the disbursement of Party funds. 
 We consider commenton such behaviour superfluous. 
 In the article on the Third Congress ( Proletary , No. 
 1 *) we expressed the wish that the breakaway group of the Party might at least organise itself into some cohesive form as quickly as possible, since this would make agreementseasier and the path towards future unity clearer. 
 Unfor-tunately, even this wish of ours has proved almost unrealis-able. 
 The resolutions of the Minority “Conference” havenow been published (see the highly interesting pamphlet, The First All-Russian Conference of Party Functionaries , a separate supplement to Iskra , No. 
 100; also Iskra , No. 
 100). 
 We earnestly recommend this pamphlet to all Party organi-sations, for we cannot imagine any better material than thisfor combating the ideas of the breakaway section of theParty. 
 These resolutions show the Minority’s total incapacity to organise even its own followers. 
 They could not even convene their own Conference; we did it for them, the Bureauof Committees of the Majority and the C. 
C. 
, when weconvened the Third Congress. 
 The delegates of the Menshevikorganisations went to the Congress on the instructions oftheir organisations, but arrived instead at the Conference! The Conference resolved not to recognise the decisions of the Third Congress—and to rescind the Party Rules adoptedat the Second Congress! The Conference was unable to con-stitute itself as a congress; its decisions were the decisions ofa consultative assembly, subject to the approval of each organisation. 
 There is no complete list of the participants at the Conference, nor are there any minutes. 
 The organisa-tions of the Minority can therefore only give their ayes andnoes to the question whether they will recognise any partic-ular resolution. 
 Thus, a vote will be taken on the resolu-tions with no opportunity for the voters to offer proposalsfor changes or to have before them a complete record of the discussion of the resolutions. 
 Heaven only knows how these votes are to be counted, since the polls in favour of confirm-ing or rejecting particular sections of the resolutions maydiffer. 
 We have here the principle of Bonapartist plebiscites,as opposed to the principle of democratic representationgenerally recognised by Social-Democrats the world over. 
 With us, democratically elected and responsible represent-*See p. 
 443 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 atives of qualified organisations consult with one another and reach a decision. 
 With them, representatives as well as guests confer and make proposals, and the qualified organisations vote aye or no post factum . 
 It is difficult to imagine a system better suited for disorganising theSocial-Democrats. 
 In practice this system of plebiscitesalways ends in a farce. 
 The Rules adopted by the Conference and consisting of thirteen clauses are a gem of their kind. 
 They erect a six-storey party structure rising in the following order: (1)Directing Board; (2) Committee; (3) Regional Congress;(4) Regional Committee; (5) Conference; and (6) ExecutiveCommittee. 
 Generally speaking, the lower body elects thehigher. 
 But the relations between the Directing Board and the Committee are not based on the principle of election but on the principle of “agreement”, as the new-Iskrists see it,or on the principle of “confusion”, as we see it. 
 On the onehand, the Committee is included en bloc in the membership of the Directing Board, together with all the members, notonly of the District Committees, but of “the groups working among the special sections of the population”. 
 On the other hand, “the District Committee includes also a representativeof the Committee”! On the one hand, all important deci-sions must come from the Directing Board; on the other, inemergency cases, the Committee may act on its own initia-tive “before inviting the opinion [!] of the District Commit-tees”. 
 What is more, “the Committee is obliged to report periodically on its activities to the district committees”. 
If a majority of the members of the District Committeesexpress no confidence in the Committee, the latter is reor-ganised “by mutual agreement between the Regional Commit-tee and the District Committees”. 
 Neither the powers nor the composition of the other Party organisations (including the District Committee) are defined in any way. 
 The conceptof Party membership, of which the Mensheviks made a majorissue at the Second Congress, has been jettisoned! Hereto-fore the principle of “agreement” among members of oneand the same organisation or party, who sing in unison on all essential questions of programme and tactics, was regard-ed as an anarchist principle. 
 Social-Democrats throughoutthe world have in such cases always followed the principle of the subordination of the minority to the majority. 
 The new-Iskrists want to show the world a shining example of the manner in which these two principles can be commingled in the most “poetic” disorder. 
 Recently we came across acopy of a German newspaper bearing the motto, “ Weder Autorität noch Majorität ” (“Neither Authority nor Major-ity”), a principle akin to the organisation-as-process theoryof the new-Iskrists. 
 The newspaper is the organ of the German anarchists: Der Anarchist . 
 In the election of the centre (“the body that unifies all Party work”) the new-Iskrists prefer indirect voting, throughelectors, to direct voting. 
 The Executive Committeeis not elected by the direct vote of the representatives ofthe Directing Boards, but in four stages ! Why this sudden dislike of direct elections God alone knows. 
 Some people wonder whether the new-Iskrists may not have been influencedby the example of Mr. 
 Struve, who wants the Upper Houseto be elected by universal suffrage, but not by direct vote. 
How this four-stage election is to be carried out, againGod alone knows, for there is not a word about it in the “Rules”. 
 Obviously it would be absurd to take the Rules seriously, though we have not exhausted their charms by far. 
They will never be put into practice. 
 The six-decker buswould not be able to budge an inch, even if it could bebuilt. 
 These Rules are of importance, not for their practi-cal value, but as a statement of principles. 
 They are a superb, peerless illustration of the famous “organisation-as-process” theory. 
 Now even the blind must see that organisa-tion-as-process means disorganisation. 
 Hitherto the Men-sheviks have acted as disorganisers of their opponents, ofthe Second Congress and the bodies created by it. 
 Now they act as disorganisers of their own followers. 
 This is truly disorganisation exalted to a principle. 
 That the Mensheviks have begun by breaking their own Rules does not surprise us. 
 They have mapped out no schemefor the division of Russia into regions. 
 They have electedno Executive Committee, not even pro tem . 
, pending the confirmation of the committees and organisations. 
 The Conference elected an Organisation Committee, which wasnot provided for in the Rules, and assigned to it special tasks! At present even temporary and partial agreements with the Mensheviks are made extremely difficult, for this Organisation Committee lacks official status, and no steps that it takes can have decisive significance. 
 Anyone desir-ing to have dealings with the Mensheviks must now takethe trouble of communicating with each of their organisa-tions separately, and even with each individual “Pan”who may say, “ Nie pozwalam !” * Finally, the most astonishing thing about the “Rules” of the Minority is the omission of all reference to Partyorgans and to Party literature in general. 
 Organs there are(Iskra , Sotsial-Demokrat 152) and will be, but the “Rules” adopted by the Conference establish no connection between them and the Party. 
 This is incredible, but it is a fact. 
 The publicists are outside the Party, above the Party. 
 No control, no reports, no material dependence. 
 Somethingreminiscent of the worst days of opportunism among theFrench socialists: the Party unto itself, and the publicistsunto themselves. 
 From this point of view the followingdecision of the Conference, viz. 
, the resolution on Party (?) literature, should perhaps not seem accidental: “The Conference deems it necessary: (1) that the OrganisationCommittee take measures to furnish the Party publicistsgreater possibilities to wage a struggle in the legal pressfor the theoretical principles of the Party. 
” A kind of proto-type of Menshevik organisation: a group of “Party publicists”, non-responsible and “independent”, indispensable and irre-placeable. 
 And attached to them—a committee to havecharge of the work of ... legal publication! It is difficult to discuss this type of organisation with the necessary seriousness. 
 The nearer the revolution and thenearer the opportunity for Social-Democrats to write openly in the “legal” press, the more strictly should the party of the proletariat adhere to the principle of the unconditionalresponsibility of “Party publicists” to the Party, of theirdependence on the Party. 
 As regards the tactical resolutions of the Conference, they admirably confirm the declaration of the Third Congress *“I do not permit!”—the expression of the “ Liberum veto ” possessed by every member of the Polish Sejm in the seventeenth andeighteenth centuries. 
— Ed. 
 on the shadings of Social-Democracy “akin to Economism”, and on “the constriction of the scope of Party work”. 
 We shall say nothing of the incredibly careless editing of the resolutions, which rather resemble jottings, aphorisms, reflec-tions, and scraps of rough copy. 
 In this respect the resolu-tions of the Conference can be rivalled only by the “Programmeof the Osvobozhdeniye League”. 
 Instead of precise, clear-cut directives issued by the highest body of the Party, we find here ... stylistic exercises of some Party literati . 
 To take the contents. 
 On the pressing question of the uprising, we are not told that it has become “essential”; that itis necessary to elucidate, not only its political significance,but its “practical and organisational aspect”; that we must“organise the proletariat” to this end and “form special groups as the need arises”. 
 (Resolution of the Third Congress. 
) Not at all. 
 First we are told that the possibility of timingthe uprising and preparing it by methods of secret organisa-tion is “excluded”; we then read that, with broader agita-tion and organisation, it is possible to convert spontaneousmovements into “planned insurrections”. 
 From this muddle the party of the proletariat is expected to derive ideological guidance! The Third Congress of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 repeats and confirms all the old truths about propaganda, agitation, the general democratic movement, etc. 
, but adds to this a new task: to organise the proletariat for the uprising, to elu-cidate the “practical and organisational aspect” of new meth-ods of struggle, of the determined struggle for freedom. 
 The Conference speaks only of “the preparation of the uprising”in general, with stale repetitions about agitation and organ-isation in general; it cannot bring itself to formulate asingle new task independently, it advances no guidingslogan on the necessity to take a step forward from the general preparation, of which we have spoken since 1902, to the treatment of the matter from the point of view of practicalorganisation. 
 Like the old Economists to a T. 
 When newtasks of the political struggle emerged upon the scene, theywere belittled, broken up into stages, and subordinated tothe tasks of the economic struggle. 
 Not only economic struggle, but political struggle, and in the broadest and boldest forms, said the revolutionarySocial-Democrats. 
 The best means of political agitation is economic struggle, answered the Economists. 
 Not only propaganda and agitation in general, the revolutionary Social-Democrats now say, not only clarification of the political significance of the uprising, but also the formationof special groups, the immediate commencement of prac-tical organisational work, “the most energetic measures forthe arming of the proletariat. 
” A planned uprising is exclud-ed, retort the new-Iskrists; we must expand agitation, strengthen organisation, prepare the conversion of the spontaneous into the planned; only in this way “can themoment of insurrection be brought nearer”, only in thisway “can the technical fighting preparations acquire moreor less serious importance”.... 
 For them the moment of insurrection has not yet “come near”! For them the practical preparations have still to “acquire more or less serious importance”! Is this not tail-ismpar excellence ? Is this not a degradation of the “urgent” task (urgent in the opinion of the Third Congress), towards whichwe have as yet done dreadfully little? Are not these peoplebacking away from uprising to agitation, as the Economists backed away from political struggle to economic struggle with the employers and the government? Read in Osvo-bozhdeniye , No. 
 71, how Mr. 
 Struve is backing away from the slogan of the “armed uprising”, how this leader of the liberalbourgeoisie is questioning the inevitability of the uprising(p. 
 340), how he lays himself out to minimise the importance of “the technical aspect of the revolution”, how he “ gives depth ” to the slogan of the uprising by pointing to the “so-cio-psychical conditions”, how he substitutes for this sloganthe slogan of “imbuing the masses with the ideas of demo-cratic reform”—and you will understand what a profoundlydemoralising influence the tail-ism of the new-Iskrists must exercise on the proletariat, and into whose hands it plays. 
 The second urgent political question is that of the pro-visional revolutionary government. 
 This question is clearlyand distinctly formulated in the resolution of the ThirdCongress. 
 The preamble speaks of the struggle for the repub-lic, which can be won only through a completely successful uprising; of the need for the convocation of the Constituent Assembly by a provisional revolutionary government inorder to guarantee truly free and fair elections; of the need to prepare for the struggle with the bourgeoisie to safeguard the gains of the revolution. 
 The conclusions and directives of the Congress: The proletariat must be made to realise the need for a provisional revolutionary government. 
 Theproletariat must put clearly defined demands before thisgovernment, namely, the realisation of the entire minimumprogramme. 
 Social-Democrats may participate in the govern-ment (action “from above”), the object of such participation being clearly specified (a ruthless struggle against counter-revolution and defence of the independent interests of theworking class). 
 The conditions of such participation aremade equally explicit. 
 The formal condition is strict controlby the Party; the material condition, i. 
e. 
, the conditiondetermining the expediency of such participation, is jealous preservation of the independence of the Social-Democratic position and the creation of the conditions for the socialistrevolution. 
 This enumeration of the conditions of partici-pation in the government, the conditions of pressure fromabove, as a new form of activity characteristic of the revo-lutionary epoch, is supplemented by an indication of the form and the purpose of pressure from below, which must be steadily maintained under all circumstances—pressureon the provisional revolutionary government by the armedproletariat led by the Social-Democratic Party. 
 Broadly, wehave here a complete answer to the new political question, a precise indication of the significance of the new forms of struggle and their purpose, of the programme of the struggle and the conditions under which these forms may be employed. 
 And in the Conference resolution? The resolution begins with the grossly erroneous assertion that “the decisive victory of the revolution over tsarism” may be signalisedeither by the establishment of a provisional government “or by the revolutionary initiative of a representative insti-tution, which, under the direct revolutionary pressure ofthe people, decides to organise a popular ConstituentAssembly”. 
 The Party may and should be given tactical directions both for the contingency of a victory of the uprising and for the contingency of its defeat, both for the contingency of the convocation of a true Constituent Assembly along revolu-tionary lines and for the contingency of the convocation of /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR a travesty of popular representation by the tsar. 
 But to apply the term decisive victory to something that lacks the essential element of victory is to confuse the revolutionary consciousness, not to lead it. 
 Any “decision” of any repre-sentative institution to organise a Constituent Assemblyis as far removed from decisive victory as word is from deed;for the tsarist government wields the power that can preventword from becoming deed. 
 There is nothing whatever to choose between the resolution of the new-Iskrists and the affirmation of the old Economists that the decisive victoryof the workers may consist either in their winning the eight-hour day or in the government’s granting them the ten-hourday, from which stage the workers will pass to the nine-hour day. 
 The Conference resolution repeats the incontestable theses of Marxism on the bourgeois nature of the democraticrevolution, but interprets them narrowly or incorrectly. 
Instead of the militant slogan of “Republic”, we are givena description of the process of “liquidation of the monar-chist regime”. 
 Instead of setting forth the conditions and tasks of the new method of struggle “from above”, which can and must be employed in a successful course of the prole-tarian uprising in the epoch of revolution, we are given theguiding rule “to remain the party of the extreme revolu-tionary opposition”. 
 This is a very useful thesis for theparliamentary struggle and action from below, but it would certainly be inadequate in the time of insurrection. 
 At such a time the task of the “opposition” consists in theviolent overthrow of the government; on this question theConference was unable to offer a guiding slogan. 
 While admitting the possibility of partial and sporadic “seizures of power” in separate cities and districts, the Conference resolution abandons the “principle” of the new Iskra that participation in a provisional revolutionary government with the bourgeoisie constitutes a betrayal ofthe proletariat, that it is Millerandism, etc. 
 Betrayal thatis partial and sporadic is betrayal none the less. 
 Limitingthe problem to separate cities and districts does not solve it, however, but merely divides our attention and splits up the question, thereby befogging the issue. 
 Lastly, theslogan of “revolutionary communes”, embodied in the Con-ference resolution, is more like an empty phrase on account of its unclarity, in contrast to the slogan of the revolution-ary-democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry. 
 The resolution of the new-Iskrists on the provisional revo-lutionary government suffers from the very fault thatglares from their resolution on insurrection, namely, aninability to determine the new tactical tasks of the moment; reiteration of the much reiterated instead of the summons to go forward; the lack of a guiding slogan for the advancedclass in the democratic revolution; a belittlement of thetasks and the scope of activity of this class, of its revolu-tionary enthusiasm and revolutionary energy. 
 The politicaltendency of this erroneous tactical line is to bring new-Iskrism closer to Osvobozhdeniye -ism, to yield the leadership in the democratic revolution to the liberal bourgeoisie, tomake the proletariat a mere satellite of the liberal bour-geoisie. 
 This basic error manifests itself also in the minor resolu-tions of the Conference. 
 Thus, instead of the slogan of winning the eight-hour day by revolutionary means (resolution of the Third Congress), the old, now inadequate slogan ofcampaigning for the legislative introduction of the eight-hourday is put forward. 
 Instead of the call for the immediateorganisation of revolutionary peasant committees, we havethe proposal solely to bring to the Constituent Assembly the demand for their formation. 
 Instead of the slogan of combating the inconsistency, narrowness, and inadequacy of theliberation movement of the bourgeoisie wherever thesetraits manifest themselves (resolution of the ThirdCongress), the Conference resolution, repeating Starover’serror, pursues the illusory aim of finding “the litmus paper”, of enumerating the “points” conformity with which, if he meets them, entitles the bourgeois democrat to be called atrue friend of the people. 
 Of course, the “points” in theresolution of the new-Iskrists have shown themselves to beincomplete. 
 The demand for the republic is missing. 
 Oneis left to conclude that a democratic group like the “Russian Liberation Union” ( Proletary , No. 
 4 *) conforms to these *See pp. 
 499-510 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 “points”, although in reality there is no guarantee whatever that the Osvobozhdeniye crowd will not predominate in this group. 
 It need hardly be said that in a newspaper article we could only give a very brief and general idea of the mainerror pervading the new Iskra ’s tactical line, as expressed in the Conference resolutions. 
 The erroneous tendencies ofthe new Iskra ’s tactical line are as serious and important to the Party as its “organisation-as-process” is not serious. 
 We therefore deal with these tendencies in detailin a special pamphlet which is now in the press and willappear very shortly.

 6, Published according to July 3 (June 20), 1905 the text in Proletary TO THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIALIST BUREAU Dear Citizens, The editors of Proletary received a telegram today from Berlin. 
 A comrade asks us to inform the InternationalSocialist Bureau that, according to a private telegram tothe Berliner Tageblatt , the Russian Government has request-ed the powers to dispatch their ships stationed at Constan-tinople to Odessa to help restore order in that city. 
 It is quite possible that the Russian Government, no longer trusting its own naval forces, will try to make the warshipsof European states fight against the Russian revolutionunder the pretext of defending the foreign residents of Odessa. 
 Thus, there is a great danger that the European peoples may be forced to play the part of executioners of Russian freedom. 
 Therefore we request you, dear citizens, to con-sider this question and seek the means of preventing suchan eventuality. 
 Perhaps it would be advisable to publishin the name of the International Socialist Bureau an appealto the workers of all countries. 
 The appeal should emphasisethat what is taking place in Russia is not mob rioting, but a revolution, a struggle for freedom, that this struggle has as its object the convocation of a Constituent Assembly,which is demanded by all progressive parties, in the firstplace by the Social-Democratic Labour Party of Russia. 
Perhaps such an appeal, translated into all languages,printed in the socialist press of the entire world and distributed by every means at our disposal, will be able to influence public opinion and frustrate the designs of the Russi-an Government—designs that would be fatal to freedom. 
 We hope that you will let us know your opinion on this matter. 
 Accept, dear citizens, our fraternal greetings.

ABSOLUTE MONARCHY That the courti-ers, the police, andthe officials maylive on the fat of the land; that the rich may rob the workersand peasants attheir own free will; that the people may remain for ever without rights andlive in darknessand ignorance. 
 THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMY AND THE REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENT The uprising in Odessa and the siding of the armoured cruiser Potemkin with the revolution marked a further big step forward in the development of the revolutionary move-ment against the autocracy. 
 Events have confirmed withamazing rapidity the timeliness of the calls to insurrectionand to the formation of a provisional revolutionary govern-ment, which were addressed to the people by the class-conscious spokesmen of the proletariat as represented by the Third Congress of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party. 
 The new outbreak of the revolutionary conflagrationthrows light on the practical significance of these calls andmakes us determine more precisely the tasks of the revolu-tionary fighters in the present situation in Russia. 
 The armed uprising of the people is maturing and is organising itself before our very eyes under the impact of the spontaneous course of events. 
 It was not so very longago that the only manifestation of the people’s struggleagainst the autocracy was revolts —unconscious, unorgan-ised, spontaneous, sometimes wild outbreaks. 
 But thelabour movement, as the movement of the most advanced class, the proletariat, rapidly outgrew this initial stage. 
 The goal-conscious propaganda and agitation carried onby the Social-Democrats had their effect. 
 Disturbances gaveway to organised strike struggles and political demonstra-tions against the autocracy. 
 The brutal military reprisals of the past few years have “educated” the proletariat and the common people of the towns, and have prepared them for higher forms of revolutionary struggle. 
 The criminal andignominious war into which the autocracy has plunged the people filled the cup of their endurance to overflowing. 
 The crowds began to offer armed resistance to the tsarist troops. 
 Real street fighting , barricade battles , started between the people and the troops. 
 Quite recently the Cauca-sus, Lodz, Odessa, and Libau have shown us examples ofproletarian heroism and popular enthusiasm. 
 The strugglegrew into an insurrection. 
 Even the tsar’s troops graduallybegan to see that they were being made to play the shame-ful role of executioners of freedom, of henchmen of the police. 
 And the army began to waver. 
 At first isolated casesof insubordination, outbreaks among reservists, protestsfrom officers, propaganda among the soldiers, refusal of somecompanies and regiments to shoot at their own brothers, theworkers. 
 Then— the siding of part of the army with the uprising . 
 The tremendous significance of the recent events in Odessa lies precisely in the fact that, for the first time, animportant unit of the armed force of tsarism—a battle-ship—has openly gone over to the side of the revolution. 
The government made frantic efforts and resorted to all possible tricks to conceal this event from the people, to stifle the mutiny of the sailors from the outset. 
 But tono avail. 
 The warships sent against the revolutionaryarmoured cruiser “ Potemkin ” refused to fight against their comrades. 
 By spreading throughout Europe the report thatthe Potemkin had surrendered and that the tsar had ordered the revolutionary armoured cruiser to be sunk, the auto-cratic government only completed its disgrace in the eyesof the entire world. 
 The squadron has returned to Sevastopol,and the government is hastening to disband the crews andto disarm the warships; reports are current of wholesale resig-nations of officers of the Black Sea Fleet; a fresh mutiny broke out on the armoured cruiser Georgi Pobedonosets , which had surrendered. 
 The sailors are also rising in Libauand in Kronstadt; clashes with the troops are becoming morefrequent; sailors and workers are fighting the troops on thebarricades (in Libau). 
 The foreign press reports mutinies ona number of other warships (the Minin , the Alexander II , and others). 
 The tsarist government finds itself without a navy . 
 The most that it has been able to achieve so far is to hold back the fleet from actively going over to the side of the revolution. 
 Meanwhile, the armoured cruiser Potemkin remains an unconquered territory of the revolution, and what-ever its fate may be, the undoubted fact and the point of highest significance is that here we have the attempt toform the nucleus of a revolutionary army . 
 No reprisals, no partial victories over the revolution can diminish the importance of this event. 
 The first step hasbeen taken. 
 The Rubicon has been crossed. 
 The siding of the army with the revolution has impressed itself as a fact upon the whole of Russia and the entire world. 
 The eventsin the Black Sea Fleet will inevitably be followed by furtherand still more energetic attempts to form a revolutionaryarmy. 
 It is our task now to give the utmost support to theseefforts, to explain to the broadest masses of the proletariat and the peasantry the nation-wide significance of a revolu-tionary army in the struggle for freedom, to assist variousunits of this army to unfurl the popular banner of freedom , the banner capable of attracting the masses and rallyingthe forces that will crush the tsarist autocracy. 
 Outbreaks—demonstrations—street fighting—units of a revolutionary army—such are the stages in the development of the popular uprising. 
 Now at last we have reached thefinal stage. 
 This does not mean, of course, that the move-ment in its entirety has advanced to this new and higherstage. 
 No, there is still a good deal of backwardness inthe movement; in the Odessa events there are unmistakable signs of old-time rioting. 
 But it does mean that the advance waves of the elemental flood have already reached the verythreshold of the absolutist “stronghold”. 
 It does mean that theadvanced representatives of the popular masses have them-selves arrived, not as a result of theoretical reasoning, butunder the impact of the growing movement, at new and higher tasks of the struggle, the final struggle against the enemy of the Russian people. 
 The autocracy has done everything t o prepare this struggle. 
 For years it has provoked the peopleto an armed struggle with its troops, and now it is reapingwhat it sowed. 
 The units of the revolutionary army arespringing up out of the army itself. 
 The task of these units is to proclaim the insurrection, to give the masses military leadership , as essential in civil war as in any other war; to create strong points for the open mass struggle; to spread the uprising to neighbouring dis-tricts; to establish complete political freedom, if only at first in a small part of the country; to embark on the revolution-ary transformation of the decayed absolutist system;and to give full scope to the revolutionary creative activityof the masses, who participate but little in this activity intime of peace, but who come to the forefront in revolution-ary epochs. 
 Only by clearly understanding these new tasks, only by posing them boldly and broadly, can the units of the revolutionary army win complete victory and become thestrong points of a revolutionary government . 
 And a revolu-tionary government is as vitally essential at the presentstage of the popular uprising as a revolutionary army. 
 Therevolutionary army is needed for military struggle and for military leadership of the masses against the remnants of the military forces of the autocracy. 
 The revolutionaryarmy is needed because great historical issues can beresolved only by force , and, in modern struggle, the organisa-tion of force means military organisation. 
 Besides the rem-nants of the autocracy’s military forces there are the mili-tary forces of the neighbouring states for whose support the tottering Russian Government is already begging, of whichlater. 
 * The revolutionary government is needed for the political leadership of the masses, at first in that part of the countrywhich has been wrested from tsarism by the revolutionary army, and later in the country at large. 
 The revolutionary government is needed for the immediate launching of thepolitical reforms, for the sake of which the revolution isbeing made—the establishment of a revolutionary self-government of the people, the convocation of a trulypopular and truly Constituent Assembly, and the introduction of “liberties” without which there can be no true expression of the people’s will. 
 The revolutionary government isnecessary for the political unification and the politicalorganisation of the insurgent section of the people, which hasactually and finally broken away from the autocracy. 
 Ofcourse, that political organisation can only be provisional, just as the revolutionary government, which has taken power in *See pp. 
 569-73 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 the name of the people in order to enforce the will of the people and to act through the instrumentality of the people, can only be provisional. 
 But this work of organisation must start immediately , and it must be indissolubly combined with every successful step of the uprising; for political con-solidation and political leadership cannot be delayed fora single moment. 
 Immediate political leadership of theinsurgent people is no less essential for the complete victory of the people over tsarism than the military leadership of its forces. 
 No one who is at all capable of forming a judgement can doubt the eventual outcome of the struggle between the sup-porters of the autocracy and the masses of the people. 
 Yetwe must not shut our eyes to the fact that the serious struggle is only beginning, that there are great trials in store for us. 
 Both the revolutionary army and the revolutionary govern-ment are “organisms” of so high a type, they demand institu-tions so complicated and a civic consciousness so developed,that it would be a mistake to expect a simple, immediate,and perfect fulfilment of these tasks from the outset. 
 No, we do not expect that; we are able to appreciate the importance of the slow, steady, and often imperceptiblework of political education which Social-Democrats havealways conducted and always will conduct. 
 But we mustnot allow what in the present circumstances would be stillmore dangerous—a lack of faith in the powers of the people. 
 We must remember what a tremendous educational and organ-ising power the revolution has, when mighty historicalevents force the man in the street out of his remote corner,garret, or basement and make a citizen out of him. 
 Months of revolution sometimes educate citizens more quickly andfully than decades of political stagnation. 
 The task of the class-conscious leaders of the revolutionary class is always to march ahead of it in the matter of education, to explainto it the meaning of the new tasks, and to urge it forwardtowards our great ultimate goal. 
 The failures inevitablyinvolved in our further attempts to form a revolutionaryarmy and a provisional revolutionary government will only teach us to meet these tasks in practice ; they will serve to draw the new and fresh forces of the people, now lyingdormant, to the work of solving them. 
 To take the military aspect. 
 No Social-Democrat at all familiar with history, who has studied Engels, the great expert on this subject, has ever doubted the tremendous importance of military knowledge, of military technique,and of military organisation as an instrument which themasses of the people, and classes of the people, use in resolv-ing great historical conflicts. 
 Social-Democracy neverstooped to playing at military conspiracies; it never gave prominence to military questions until the actual conditions of civil war had arisen. 
 * But now all Social-Democrats have advanced the military questions, if not to the firstplace, at least to one of the first places, and they are puttinggreat stress on studying these questions and bringing themto the knowledge of the masses. 
 The revolutionary army must apply the military knowledge and the military means on the practical plane for the determination of the furtherdestiny of the Russian people, for the determination ofthe most vital and pressing question—the question offreedom. 
 Social-Democracy has never taken a sentimental view of war. 
 It unreservedly condemns war as a bestial means of settling conflicts in human society. 
 But Social-Democracyknows that so long as society is divided into classes, solong as there is exploitation of man by man, wars areinevitable. 
 This exploitation cannot be destroyed withoutwar, and war is always and everywhere begun by the exploiters themselves, by the ruling and oppressing classes. 
 There are wars and wars. 
 There are adventuristwars, fought to further dynastic interests, to satisfy theappetite of a band of freebooters, or to attain the objectsof the knights of capitalist profit. 
 And there is anotherkind of war—the only war that is legitimat e in capitalist society—war against the people’s oppressors and enslavers. 
 Only utopians and philistines can condemn such a war onprinciple. 
 Only the bourgeois betrayers of freedom canstand aloof from such a war in Russia today, the war for *Cf.

) the people’s freedom. 
 The proletariat in Russia has started that great war of liberation, and it will go on with it, forming units of a revolutionary army, reinforcing the units of the soldiers or sailors that have come overto its side, enlisting the peasants, imbuing the newcitizens of Russia, formed and steeled in the fire of civil war, with the heroism and enthusiasm of fighters for thefreedom and happiness of all mankind. 
 The task of establishing a revolutionary government is as new, as difficult, and as complicated as the task of themilitary organisation of the revolutionary forces. 
 Butthis task, too, can and must be fulfilled by the people. 
 Inthis matter, too, every partial failure will lead to animprovement in methods and means, to the consolidation and extension of the results. 
 The Third Congress of the R. 
S.

L. 
P. 
 outlined in its resolution the general condi-tions for dealing with this new task; it is now time to con-sider and prepare the conditions for its practical realisa-tion. 
 Our Party has a minimum programme, a completeprogramme of the changes that are immediately achievable within the framework of the democratic (i. 
e. 
, bourgeois) revolution, and which the proletariat needs in its furtherstruggle for the triumph of the socialist revolution. 
 Butthis programme contains basic demands, as well as partialdemands that follow from the basic ones or are assumed. 
In every attempt to establish a provisional revolutionary government it is important to advance precisely the basic demands in order to show to the whole of the people, evento the most unenlightened masses, in brief formulation, insharp and clear outline, the aims of this government andits tasks that are of significance to the entire people. 
 There are, in our view, six such fundamental points that must become the political banner and the immediate programme of any revolutionary government. 
 They shouldenlist the sympathy of the people for that government andshould be regarded as the most urgent task, upon the accom-plishment of which the whole revolutionary energy of thepeople must be concentrated. 
 The six points are: (1) a Constituent Assembly of all the people, (2) arming of the people, (3) political freedom, (4)complete freedom for the oppressed and disfranchised nation-alities, (5) the eight-hour day, and (6) peasant revolutionary committees. 
 Of course, this is only a tentative list, rep-resenting the headings , the designations, of a series of changes that are required immediately for winning the demo-cratic republic. 
 We do not claim that the list is complete. 
We merely want to stress the importance of certain basictasks. 
 The revolutionary government must strive to securethe support of the masses, of the mass of the working class and of the peasantry; short of doing this, it will not be able to maintain itself; without the revolutionary activity ofthe people it will be a mere nothing, worse than nothing. 
It is our duty to warn the people against the adventurismof high-sounding but absurd promises (like immediate“socialisation”, which even its advocates do not under-stand), while at the same time we must propose changes that are really practicable at the present moment and reallynecessary for strengthening the cause of the revolution. 
The revolutionary government must rouse the “people” andorganise its revolutionary activity. 
 Complete freedom for the oppressed nationalities, i. 
e. 
, the recognition, not only of their cultural, but of their political, self-determination; the introduction of urgent measures for the protection ofthe working class (the eight-hour day as the first in a seriesof such measures), and lastly, the guarantee of serious meas-ures, without regard for the egotistic interests of the land-lords, in favour of the mass of the peasantry—such, in our opinion, are the chief points that every revolutionary gov-ernment must especially emphasise. 
 We shall not discussthe first three points, which are too obvious to requirecomment. 
 Nor shall we discuss the need for practicallyimplementing reforms even in a small territory, one, forinstance, that has been wrested from tsarism; practical imple-mentation is a thousand times more important than mani-festos, and, of course, a thousand times more difficult. 
 Wemerely wish to draw attention to the fact that it is neces-sary now, without delay, to spread by every possible meansa correct idea of our general and immediate tasks. 
 We mustknow how to appeal to the people—in the true sense of the word—not only with a general call to struggle (this suffices in the period preceding the formation of the revolutionarygovernment), but with a direct call for the immediate implementation of the most essential democratic reforms, for their independent realisation without delay. 
 The revolutionary army and the revolutionary govern-ment are two sides of the same medal. 
 They are two insti-tutions equally necessary for the success of the uprising andfor the consolidation of its results. 
 They are two sloganswhich must be advanced and explained as the only consis-tent revolutionary slogans. 
 There are many people today who call themselves democrats; however, many are called, but few are chosen. 
 There are many spokesmen of the “Con-stitutional-Democratic Party”; but in so-called “society”,in the would-be democratic Zemstvos, there are fewtrue democrats, men who are sincerely in favour of the com-plete sovereignty of the people and are capable of waging a life-and-death struggle against the enemies of that sov-ereignty, the defenders of the tsarist autocracy. 
 The working class is free of the cowardice, the hypo-critical half-heartedness that is characteristic of the bourgeoi-sie as a class. 
 The working class can and must be fully andconsistently democratic. 
 The working class has proved its right to the role of vanguard in the democratic revolution by the blood it has shed on the streets of St. 
 Petersburg,Riga, Libau, Warsaw, Lodz, Odessa, Baku, and many othercities. 
 It must prove equal to this great role at the presentdecisive moment too. 
 While never for a moment forgettingtheir socialist goal, their class and Party independence, the class-conscious representatives of the proletariat, the mem-bers of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
, must come forward before thewhole of the people with the advanced democratic slogans. 
For us, for the proletariat, the democratic revolution isonly the first step on the road to the complete emancipationof labour from all exploitation, to the great socialist goal. 
 All the more quickly, therefore, must we pass this first stage; all the more decisively must we settle accounts withthe enemies of the people’s freedom; all the louder must weproclaim the slogans of consistent democracy: a revolution-ary army and a revolutionary government. 
 Proletary , No. 
 7, Published according to July 10 (June 27), 1905 the text in Proletary Checked with the manuscript THE RUSSIAN TSAR SEEKS THE PROTECTION OF THE TURKISH SULTAN AGAINST HIS PEOPLE The foreign press of all countries and all parties is teeming with reports, telegrams, and articles concerning the siding of part of the Black Sea Fleet with the Russian revolution. 
 The newspapers are at a loss for words in which to expresstheir astonishment; they find no terms strong enough todescribe the disgrace which the autocratic government hasbrought upon itself. 
 The peak in this disgrace was the tsarist government ’s appeal to Rumania and Turkey for police assistance against the mutinous sailors. 
 Here is proof positive that the “Turkswithin” are a greater menace to the Russian people than allthe “Turks without”. 
 The Sultan of Turkey is to protect thetsarist autocracy from the Russian people; the tsar cannotrely on Russia’s armed forces, and so he begs other powers for help. 
 Better proof of the utter bankruptcy of the tsar-ist regime can hardly be imagined. 
 Better material to makethe soldiers of the Russian army see the role they are play-ing could hardly be found. 
 Observe what The Times of July 4 (new style) writes editorially. 
 It should be noted that this is one of the most affluent and best-informed newspapers in the world, and that this mouthpiece of the conservative English bourgeoi-sie finds even our Osvobozhdeniye liberals over-radical, sym-pathises with the “Shipovians”, etc. 
 In a word, no one canpossibly suspect it of exaggerating the strength and impor-tance of the Russian revolution. 
 “The impotence of the [Russian] Government at sea,” writes The Times , “receives a striking illustration from the Note it is stated to have sent to the Porte , [i. 
e. 
, to the Turkish Government] and to the Government of Rumania . 
 This document [of the Russian Government] calls upon the Governments in question to treat the mutinous sailors of the Russian fleet as common criminals, and warns themthat should they act otherwise international complicationsmay follow. 
 In other words, the Government of the Tsar isstooping to beg the Sultan of Turkey and the King of Ruma-nia to be good enough to do for him the police work which he is no longer able to do for himself. 
 Whether Abdul Hamid will condescend to give him the required assistance or notremains to be seen. 
 So far the only result of the mutiny uponthe Turkish authorities has been to induce them to exhibitunusual vigilance, and the first exhibition of it has beenthat they fired a blank shot across the bows of the Russian guardship on Saturday, when she was entering the Bospo-rus after dark with the Russian Ambassador on board. 
 They would hardly have asserted their watchfulness in that fash-ion twelve months ago. 
 The Government of Rumania right-ly ignored the demand that the mutineers should be treatedas criminals, as was to be expected from the rulers of a self-respecting nation. 
 They issued orders that the mutineers were not to be furnished with coals or provisions, but theyinformed the 700 sailors on board the Kniaz Potemkin t ha t if they choose to land they will be treated only as foreigndeserters. 
” And so the Rumanian Government does not in the least side with the revolution; far from it! Yet it has no desire to stoop to police service for the universally hated anddespised tsar of all the Russias. 
 It refuses the tsar’s request. 
It acts in the only way the “ government of a self-respecting nation ” can act. 
 That is how the Russian autocracy is now spoken of in Europe by those who only yesterday fawned on the “great and mighty monarch”! Now comes confirmation in the German press as well of this new, unheard-of disgrace of the autocracy. 
 A reporttelegraphed to the Frankfurter Zeitung from Constanti-nople under date of July 4 (N. 
S. 
) states: “The Russian Am-bassador Zinoviev handed a Note yesterday [to the Turkish Government] from the St. 
 Petersburg Cabinet stating thatabout 400 Russian seamen, after sinking a cruiser, had been picked up the day before yesterday by an English merchant vessel bound for Constantinople. 
 The [Russian] Ambassador demanded of Turkey the detention of the steamer during its passage through the Bosporus and the arrest andextradition of the mutinous Russian seamen. 
 That eveningthe Turkish Government called a special meeting ofthe Council of Ministers which considered the Russianrequest.... 
 Turkey replied to the Russian Embassy that she was unable to comply, since according to her international obligations Turkey had no right to exercise police power ona steamer sailing under the English flag, even when thesteamer puts into a Turkish harbour. 
 Besides, there existedno extradition treaty between Russia and Turkey. 
” Turkey replied “courageously”, the German newspaper comments on the incident. 
 The Turks refuse to do police duty for the tsar! It is also reported that when the destroyer Stremitelny * and several other warships came to Constanta (Rumania) in pursuit of the Potemkin , the Rumanian Government point-ed out to the Russian authorities that in Rumanian waters it was the Rumanian army and the Rumanian police that maintained order, even if the Potemkin was still in Rumanian waters. 
 Thus, instead of the Potemkin creating trouble for foreign ships (as the tsarist autocracy had predicted in order tofrighten Europe), these ships are plagued by a host of annoy-ing incidents caused by the Russian fleet. 
 The English are indignant at the detention and search of their ship Granley at Odessa. 
 The Germans are incensed by reports that, atthe request of the Russians, the Turks will stop and searchthe German ship Pera on her way to Constantinople from Odessa. 
 Perhaps, under these circumstances, it will not be so easy for Russia to secure European assistance against the Russian revolutionaries. 
 The question of rendering suchassistance is being discussed by a great many foreign papers,but in most cases they come to the conclusion that it is notEurope’s business to help the tsar fight the Potemkin . 
 The Berliner Tageblatt publishes a report that the Russian *It is said that there are no ratings on the Stremitelny . 
 Its crew consists almost entirely of officers. 
 The aristocracy against the people! Government has even requested the powers to send their war-ships from Constantinople to Odessa to help restore order! How much truth there is in this statement (denied by certain other papers) the near future will show. 
 But one thing iscertain: with the Potemkin joining the uprising the first step has been taken towards converting the Russian revolutioninto an international force by bringing it face to face withthe European states. 
 This fact should not be forgotten in appraising the tele-graphic report of M. 
 Leroux to the Paris newspaper Le Matin from St. 
 Petersburg on July 4 (N. 
S. 
): “Throughout this [ Potemkin ] affair,” he writes, “the lack of foresight on the part of the [Russian] authorities has been astonishing;one cannot overstate the lack of organisation of the revolu-tion . 
 The revolution gains possession of a battleship, an event unique in history, but it does not know what to dowith it. 
” There is, undeniably, a great deal of truth in this report. 
 Without a doubt we are to blame for not organising the rev-olution sufficiently. 
 We are to blame that certain Social-Democrats are but faintly conscious of the fact that revo-lution must be organised, that the uprising must be includedamong the urgent practical problems, and that the necessity ofa provisional revolutionary government must be stressed inour propaganda. 
 We revolutionaries deserve the criticism nowlevelled at us by bourgeois writers for our poor organisation of revolutionary functions. 
 But whether the armoured cruiser Potemkin deserves this reproach we do not venture to say. 
 Perhaps it was the delib-erate aim of the crew to show themselves in the harbour ofa European power? Did not the Russian Government keepall news of the events in the Black Sea Fleet from the people until the Potemkin had freely entered the waters of Ru-mania? In Rumania the revolutionary battleship delivereda proclamation to the consuls with a declaration of war onthe tsarist fleet and a statement to the effect that it wouldcommit no hostile acts against neutral ships. 
 The Russian revolution has declared to Europe that a state of open war exists between the Russian people and tsarism . 
 By doing so the Russian revolution has actually made an attempt tospeak in the name of a new, revolutionary government of /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR Russia. 
 Undoubtedly, this is merely a first, feeble attempt, but, as the saying goes, the first step is always the hardest. 
 According to the latest reports, the Potemkin has arrived at Feodosia, demanding provisions and coal. 
 The localpopulation is in a turmoil. 
 The workers demand that therequest of the revolutionary battleship be granted. 
 The Munic-ipal Council decided to refuse coal, but to supply provi-sions. 
 The whole of South Russia is agitated as never before. 
 The number of victims of the civil war in Odessa is estimated at 6,000. 
 Telegraphic reports speak of the shooting of 160 insurgents by court martial, and of an order from St. 
Petersburg “ to give no quarter !” But the troops are powerless; the troops themselves are unreliable. 
 In the factory suburbsof Odessa the turmoil has not subsided. 
 Last night (July 4-5, N. 
S. 
) thirty-five people were killed. 
 By order of the Governor-General, many of the troops have been withdrawnfrom the city following the discovery of a serious lack of discipline among them . 
 In Nikolayev and Sevastopol disturb-ances arose in the government arsenals. 
 Thirteen peoplehave been killed at Sevastopol. 
 Peasant uprisings have broken out in five uyezds of Kherson Gubernia. 
 Nearly 700 peasants were killed in the last four days . 
 “A life-and-death struggle between the people and the bureaucracy hasapparently begun,” says a telegram from Odessa to Londondated July 5, N. 
S. 
 Yes, the real struggle for freedom, the life-and-death struggle, is only beginning. 
 The revolutionary armoured cruiser has not said its last word yet. 
 Long live the revolu-tionary army! Long live the revolutionary government! Proletary , No. 
 7, Published according to July 10 (June 27), 1905 the text in Proletary THE BOURGEOISIE BARGAINS WITH THE AUTOCRACY, THE AUTOCRACY BARGAINS WITH THE BOURGEOISIE Almost every day brings fresh evidence of this “bargain-ing”, to which we have been directing the attention of the Russian proletarians for so long a time. 
 Here is an inter-esting telegram from M. 
 Leroux dated St. 
 Petersburg, July 2(new style): A meeting of municipal and Zemstvo repre-sentatives held on June 28 and 29 (15 and 16, old style) oncemore (for the hundredth time!) formulated constitutional demands and telegraphed them to the ministries. 
 The demands are higher than usual: popular representation ismade an absolute condition, and is to be incorporated in theconstitution ; the “Bulygin” Constitution is rejected outright; the demand is put forth for the immediate proclamation ofthe inviolability of the person, freedom of speech, etc. 
 The conference is said to have unanimously adopted ( but not to have included in the petition —in bargaining one must not show all one’s cards!) the demand for universal suffrage. 
 How does the correspondent of the bourgeois paper judge this significant increase in the demands of the landlordsand manufacturers? Oh, his judgement is a most sober one: “It is obvious ,” he writes, “ that the delegates demand more in order to get at least a little. 
 But it is certain alsothat this little , to be acceptable to them , must lie between that which they demand and that which Bulygin is offeringthem . 
” A veritable market, at which the bourgeoisie is bargain-ing away the rights and interests of the Russian workers and the Russian peasants. 
 As in a market, the buyer—thebourgeoisie, and the seller—the tsar shake hands on the bargain, shout for the hundredth time that this is their “last word”, swear that they are “losing money”, threaten to go away, but cannot bring themselves to break up their close friendship. 
 If the tsar does not meet our demands, “one of the most prominent members of the [Zemstvo] conference” said toM. 
 Leroux, “we will appeal to the people”. 
 What is one to understand by this oft-repeated “appeal to the people”? the French correspondent asks himself and his readers. 
 And he answers: here there is no Faubourg St. 
Antoine (the workers’ district in Paris; cf. 
 the article inVperyod , No. 
 2 154). 
 The people are inclined to keep off the street and to stay at home, to protest in the Tolstoian mannerby refusing to pay taxes!... Do not slander the people, you bourgeois betrayers of liberty! No slander will ever cleanse the stain of your shame-ful cowardice. 
 The people are shedding their bloodthroughout Russia. 
 Faubourgs St. 
 Antoine of our own arespringing up in a number of towns and in countless villages. 
The people are waging a desperate struggle. 
 If you had really wanted to “appeal to the people” (and not merely threaten your ally, the tsar, to do so) you should not have assignedhundreds and thousands of rubles for your talking-shops,but millions for the armed uprising. 
 You should have elect-ed a delegation, not to cool its heels in the antechambersof the tsar, but to make contact with the revolutionary par-ties, with the revolutionary people. 
 The tsar and his gang know only too well that you are incapable of doing so because you are afraid for your money-bags, because you are afraid of the people. 
 Therefore thetsar is entirely right in treating you as flunkeys; in feedingyou the same old promises, the same old Bulygin Constitu-tion; in assuming that you will not dare to make even a real, emphatic protest, not even against that Bulygin sop. 
 Smallwonder that the special correspondent of the Journal de Genève , a “respectable” liberal paper, wrote recently: “The liberals do not conceal from themselves the imperfections[!] of the Bulygin plan, but they think it should be accepted in the interests of order and progress.... 
 To reject the govern-ment ’s plan would mean deliberately to destroy the last hope for a peaceful outcome to the present conflict between the people and the bureaucratic regime . 
” (The last sentence is underscored by the correspondent himself. 
) The bourgeoisie wants peace with the tsar and fears the war of the people against the tsar . 
 The tsar wants peace with the bourgeoisie, but does not fear the war with the people,which he has started and is ruthlessly continuing. 
 Is it notobvious that if the people fail to achieve complete victory in spite of the treachery of the bourgeoisie , the inevitable outcome of this situation will be the Bulygin Constitution? Proletary , No. 
 7, Published according to July 10 (June 27), 1905 the text in Proletary N O T E S 1 2 3 4 5Lenin’s article “ The Autocracy and the Proletariat ” was published as an editorial in issue No. 
 1 of the newspaper Vperyod . 
 Vperyod (Forward ) was an underground Bolshevik weekly pub-lished in Geneva from December 22, 1904 (January 4, 1905), to May 5 (18), 1905. 
 Eighteen numbers were issued. 
 The newspaper’s organiser, manager, and guiding spirit was V. 
 I. 
 Lenin. 
 Other members of the Editorial Board were V. 
 V. 
 Vorovsky, M. 
 S. 
 Olmin-sky, and A. 
 V. 
 Lunacharsky. 
 The outstanding role which the newspaper played in combating Menshevism, re-establishing the Party principle, and formulating and elucidating the issues posed by the rising revolution was acknowledged in a special resolution of the Third Party Con-gress, which recorded a vote of thanks to the Editorial Board. 
 Over forty articles and minor items by Lenin were published in Vperyod . 
 Some issues of the newspaper, e. 
g. 
, Nos. 
 4 and 5, which dealt with the events of January 9 (22), 1905, were written almost entirely by Lenin. 
 Vperyod maintained regular contacts with the Party organisa-tions in Russia. 
 Especially close connections existed with the St. 
 Petersburg, Moscow, Odessa, Baku, Ekaterinoslav, and other Party committees, as well as with the Caucasian League Committee of the R. 
S. 
D.

 Lenin’s articles in Vperyod were often reprinted in the local Bol-shevik press and published in the form of leaflets and pamphlets. 
 p. 
 17 Zemstvo —the name given to the local government bodies formed in the central provinces of tsarist Russia in 1864. 
 They were domi-nated by the nobility and their powers were limited to purely local economic problems (hospital and road building, statistics, insur-ance, etc. 
). 
 Their activities were controlled by the Provincial Gover-nors and by the Ministry of the Interior, which could rescind any decisions of which the government disapproved. 
 p. 
 21 Municipal councillors —members of municipal councils in tsarist Russia. 
 p. 
 21 The reference is to the tsar’s ukase of December 12 (25), 1904, to the Senate.

 21 Zemstvo councillors —members of Zemstvo assemblies in tsarist Russia. 
 p. 
 22 6 7 8 9The reference is to the tsarist government’s brief flirtation with the liberals in 1904. 
 Svyatopolk-Mirsky, the Minister of the Interior, sanctioned the Zemstvo meetings, slightly relaxed the censorship, pardoned several banished liberal politicians, etc. 
 p. 
 22 Plehve , V. 
 K. 
 —a statesman in tsarist Russia; between 1902 and 1904 Minister of the Interior and Chief of the Gendarmes. 
 He waged a bitter fight against the revolutionary movement. 
 p. 
 22 Osvobozhdeniye liberals—bourgeois liberals grouped round the magazine Osvobozhdeniye (Emancipation ), which was published abroad in 1902-05 under the editorship of P. 
 B. 
 Struve. 
 The Osvobozh-deniye liberals organised the liberal-monarchist Osvobozhdeniye League in January 1904. 
 Later they formed the nucleus of the principal bourgeois party in Russia—the Constitutional-Dem-ocratic Party (Cadets). 
 p. 
 24 Socialists-Revolutionaries (S. 
R. 
’s)—a petty-bourgeois party in Russia, which arose at the end of 1901 and the beginning of 1902 as a result of the union of the Narodnik groups and circles. 
 The news-paper Revolutsionnaya Rossiya (Revolutionary Russia ) (1900-05) and the magazine Vestnik Russkoi Revolutsii (Herald of the Russian Revolution ) (1901-05) became its official organs. 
 The views of the S. 
R. 
’s were an eclectic mixture of the ideas of Narodism and revi-sionism; they tried, as Lenin put it, to patch up “the rents in the Narodnik ideas” with “bits of fashionable opportunist ‘criticism’ of Marxism”. 
 (See present edition, Vol. 
 9, “Socialism and the Peasantry”, p. 
 310. 
) The S. 
R. 
’s failed to see the class distinctions between proletariat and peasantry, glossed over the class differen-tiation and contradictions within the peasantry, and rejected the proletariat’s leading role in the revolution. 
 The tactics of individual terrorism which the S. 
R. 
’s advocated as a basic method of struggle against the autocracy caused great harm to the revolutionary movement and made it difficult to organise the masses for revo-lutionary struggle. 
 The agrarian programme of the S. 
R. 
’s envisaged the abolition of private ownership of the land and its transfer to the village com-munes on the basis of equalised tenure, as well as the development of all forms of co-operation. 
 There was nothing socialistic in this programme, which the S. 
R. 
’s sought to present as a programme for “socialising the land”, since abolition of private ownership of the land alone, as Lenin pointed out, cannot abolish the domination of capital and the poverty of the masses. 
 The real, historically pro-gressive content of the S. 
R. 
 agrarian programme was the struggle for the abolition of landlord ownership, for the “American” way of capitalist development in Russian agriculture. 
 This programme objectively expressed the interests and aspirations of the peasantry at the stage of the bourgeois-democratic revolution. 
 The Bolshevik Party fought hard against the attempts of the S. 
R. 
’s to camouflage themselves as socialists and to spread their influence to the working class, against their tactics of individual 10 11terrorism; the S. 
R. 
’s were the chief opponents of the Bolsheviks, who struggled to gain influence over the peasantry and to strengthen the alliance between the working class and the peasantry. 
 At the same time, on definite conditions, the Bolsheviks concluded tempo-rary agreements with the S. 
R. 
’s in the struggle against tsarism. 
 In the final analysis, the absence of class homogeneousness in the peasantry was responsible for the political and ideological insta-bility and the organisational confusion in the Socialist-Revolution-ary Party, and for its constant vacillation between the liberal bourgeoisie and the proletariat. 
 There had been a split in the Socialist-Revolutionary Party during the first Russian revolution, its Right Wing forming the legal Toilers’ Popular-Socialist Party, which held views close to those of the Constitutional-Democrats and the “Left” Wing taking shape as the semi-anarchist league of “Maximalists”. 
 During the Stolypin reaction, the Socialist-Revolu-tionary Party experienced a complete ideological and organisation-al break-down, and the First World War saw most S. 
R. 
’s adopt the standpoint of social-chauvinism. 
 After the victory of the February bourgeois-democratic revolution in 1917, the S. 
R. 
’s, together with the Mensheviks and Constitution-al-Democrats, were the mainstay of the counter-revolutionary bour-geois-landlord Provisional Government, in which leaders of the party (Kerensky, Avksentyev, Chernov) participated. 
 Influenced by the revolutionising of the peasantry, the “Left” Wing of the S. 
R. 
’s founded an independent party of Left S. 
R. 
’s at the end of Novem-ber 1917. 
 Striving to maintain their influence among the peasant masses, the Left S. 
R. 
’s formally recognised the Soviet power and entered into an agreement with the Bolsheviks, but with the devel-opment of the class struggle in the villages they turned against the Soviet power. 
 During the foreign military intervention and the Civil War, the S. 
R. 
’s carried on counter-revolutionary subversive activity, strongly supported the interventionists and whiteguard generals, took part in counter-revolutionary plots, and organised terrorist acts against leaders of the Soviet state. 
 After the Civil War, the S. 
R. 
’s continued their hostile activity against the Soviet state within the country and abroad among whiteguard émigrés.

 24 Lenin applies the word “secret” ironically to the congress of chair-men of Zemstvo Boards and other Zemstvo officials which was due to be held on November 6, 1904, in St. 
 Petersburg by permission of the tsar. 
 Five days before the opening when the delegates had begun to arrive, it was announced that the tsarist government had proposed the postponement of the congress for a year. 
 However, Minister of the Interior Svyatopolk-Mirsky, who was flirting with the liberals, allowed the Zemstvo delegates to have a chat “over a cup of tea in private apartments”.

 27 Iskra (The Spark ) was the first all-Russian underground Marxist newspaper; it was founded by Lenin in 1900. 
 Iskra became the centre for the unification of Party forces, for the rallying and training of Party workers. 
 It played a decisive role in the struggle for a Marxist party, in the defeat of the “Econo-mists”, and in the unification of the scattered Social-Democratic circles.

 The Editorial Board was the centre abroad of the “Economists” ( Rabocheye Dyelo -ists). 
 Rabo-cheye Dyelo supported the Bernsteinian slogan of “freedom to criti-cise” Marxism and took an opportunist stand on the questions of the tactics and organisational tasks of Russian Social-Democracy; itrejected the revolutionary potentialities of the peasantry, etc. 
 TheRabocheye Dyelo -ists propagated opportunist ideas of the subor-dination of the political struggle to the economic struggle; theybowed to the spontaneity of the labour movement and denied theleading role of the Party.

 68 Narodism (from the word narod —people)—a petty-bourgeois trend in the Russian revolutionary movement, which began to man-ifest itself in the sixties and seventies of the nineteenth century. 
 The Narodniks stood for the abolition of the autocracy and the trans-fer of the landlords’ lands to the peasantry. 
 At the same time, they believed capitalism in Russia to be a fortuitous phenomenon with no prospect of development, and they therefore considered the peas-antry, and not the proletariat, to be the main revolutionary force in Russia. 
 They regarded the village commune as the embryo of socialism. 
 With the object of rousing the peasantry to struggle against absolutism, the Narodniks “went among the people”, to the village, but they found no support there. 
 In the eighties and nineties the Narodniks adopted a policy of conciliatoriness to tsarism, expressed the interests of the kulak class, and waged a persistent fight against Marxism. 
 p. 
 72 Narodnaya Volya members —participants in the secret political organisation of the Narodnik terrorists called Narodnaya Volya (The People’s Will), which came into being in August 1879 as a result of the split in the Zemlya i Volya (Land and Freedom) secret society. 
 The immediate aim of the Narodnaya Volya was the over-throw of the autocracy. 
 Its programme called for the organisation of “a permanent representative assembly of the people” elected on the basis of universal suffrage, the proclamation of democratic liber-ties, transfer of the land to the people, and adoption of measures for transferring the factories and mills to the workers. 
 The Narodnaya Volya members, however failed to and a way to the broad masses and took the path of political conspiracies and individual terrorism. 
 Their terroristic struggle was not supported by the revolutionary movement of the masses, and this enabled the government to wreck the organisation by means of savage persecutions, death sentences, and provocations. 
 After 1881 the Narodnaya Volya broke up. 
 Abortive attempts to revive it were made repeatedly in the course of the eighties. 
 Thus, in 1886 a terrorist group was formed, headed by A. 
 I. 
 Ulyanov (Lenin’s brother) and P. 
 Y. 
 Shevyryov, which followed the tradi-34 35 36 37 38 39tions of the Narodnaya Volya. 
 After the failure of the attempt to assassinate Alexander III the group was discovered and its active members were executed. 
 While criticising their fallacious and utopian programme, Lenin thought highly of the noble struggle of the Narodnaya Volya members against tsarism. 
 In 1899, in “A Protest by Russian Social-Democrats”, he pointed out that “the members of the old Narodnaya Volya managed to play an enormous role in the history of Russia, despite the fact that only narrow social strata supported the few heroes, and despite the fact that it was by no means a revolutionary theory which served as the banner of the movement”.

 72 Legal Marxism —a bourgeois perversion of Marxism, which orig-inated in the nineties of the past century among the bourgeois intellectuals. 
 The “legal Marxists” tried to make the labour move-ment serve the interests of the bourgeoisie. 
 While criticising the Narodniks and acknowledging the capitalist path of development the “legal Marxists” denied the inevitability of capitalism’s down-fall. 
 They threw out of the Marxian doctrine its most important tenet, the doctrine of the proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat.

 It countered the Bol-sheviks’ programmatic demand for the right of nations to self-de-termination by a demand for cultural-national autonomy. 
 During the First World War (1914-18) it adopted the position of the social-chauvinists. 
 In 1917 it supported the counter-revolutionary Provi-sional Government and fought on the side of the enemies of the October Socialist Revolution. 
 During the Civil War leading Bund members joined forces with the counter-revolution. 
 At the same time, a change was taking place among the rank and file of the Bund in favour of collaboration with the Soviet power. 
 When the victory of the dictatorship of the proletariat over the internal counter-revolution and the foreign interventionists became clearly revealed, the Bund declared that it relinquished its struggle against the Soviet power. 
 In March 1921 the Bund decided to dissolve itself, and part of its membership entered the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on the basis of the rules of admission.

 126 The League of Russian Revolutionary Social-Democracy Abroad was founded in October 1901 on Lenin’s initiative. 
 Members of the League were the foreign section of the Iskra -Zarya organisation, and the Sotsial-Demokrat organisation, which included the Emancipa-tion of Labour group. 
 The aim of the League was to disseminate the ideas of revolutionary Social-Democracy and help to build up a militant Social-Democratic organisation. 
 Actually the League was Iskra ’s representative abroad. 
 It recruited Iskra adherents from among Russian Social-Democrats living abroad, gave financial support to Iskra , organised delivery of the paper to Russia, and published Marxist popular literature. 
 It also brought out several bulletins and pamphlets. 
 The Second Congress of the R.

 Unlike the Jacobins, the Girondists wavered between revolution and coun-ter-revolution, and entered into deals with the monarchy. 
 Lenin called the opportunist trend in Social-Democracy the “So-cialist Gironde”, and the revolutionary Social-Democrats—prole-tarian Jacobins, the “Mountain”.

 Speaking of the “subterfuges of the Party’s ‘Shidlovsky Commission’” Lenin had in mind the double-dealing of the Central Committee, where the Mensheviks had seized control and which formally went on record for a Third Congress while actually opposing the convocation of the Party Congress.

 Named after its founder Mikhail Bakunin (1814-76). 
 The basic postulate of Bakuninism was the negation of the state as such including the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
 The Bakuninists held that the revo-lution was to take the form of immediate popular revolts directed by a secret revolutionary society, made up of “outstanding” indi-viduals. 
 The theory and the tactics of the Bakuninists were severely condemned by Marx and Engels. 
 Lenin described Bakuninism as the world outlook “of the petty bourgeois who despairs of his salvation”. 
 Bakuninism was one of the ideological sources of Narodism. 
 Tkachovism —from Tkachov, one of the ideologists of Narodism. 
 He ignored the role of the popular masses and advocated the idea of a conspiratorial organisation and the tactics of individual terrorism.

 The Congress was 111 112113organised and convened by the Bolsheviks under the direction of Lenin. 
 It was the first Bolshevik congress. 
 The agenda, drawn up by Lenin and approved by the Congress, consisted of the following items: (I) Report of the Organising Com-mittee . 
 (II) Questions of Tactics : 1) the armed uprising; 2) attitude towards the government’s policy on the eve and at the moment of the revolution (this point was devoted to two questions: a. 
 atti-tude towards the government’s policy on the eve of the revolution; b. 
 the provisional revolutionary government); 3) attitude towards the peasant movement.

; 7) attitude towards the non-Russian Social-Democratic organisations; 8) attitude towards the liberals; 9) practical agreements with the Socialists-Revolutionaries. 
 (V) Internal Questions of Party Life : 10) propaganda and agitation. 
 (VI) Delegates ’ Reports : 11) report of the Central Committee; 12) reports of the delegates of the local committees. 
 (VII) Elections : 13) elections; 14) procedure for pub-lishing the resolutions and the proceedings of the Congress and for the assumption of office by the newly elected functionaries. 
 On all the basic issues dealt with by the Third Congress Lenin had written the draft resolutions, which he substantiated in arti-cles published in Vperyod prior to the Congress. 
 Lenin spoke at the Congress on the question of the armed uprising, on the participation of Social-Democrats in the provisional revolutionary government, on the attitude towards the peasant movement, on the Party Rules, and on a number of other questions. 
 The proceedings of the Congress record 138 speeches and motions made by Lenin. 
 The Congress amended the Party Rules: a) it adopted Lenin’s wording of Clause 1; b) it defined precisely the rights of the Central Committee and its relations with the local committees, c) it modi-fied the organisational structure of the Party’s central bodies: in place of the three centres (the Central Committee, the Central Organ, and the Council of the Party) the Congress established a single competent party centre—the Central Committee.
