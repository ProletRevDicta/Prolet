PLEKHANOV’S TEXT I. 
 The principal economic fea-ture of present day society is thedomination of capitalist produc-tion relations in it, i. 
e. 
, ownership of the means of production and of commoditycirculation by the numericallyvery small class of capitalists, while the majority of the popula-tion consists of proletarians, who have no other possession but their labour-power, and cannot subsist except by selling it. 
 In consequence of this, the major-jority of the population is reducedto the dependent position of wage-workers, whose labour creates the income of the capitalists. 
 II.

 III.

 IV. 
 The development of labour productivity does not raise theprice of labour-power, but, on the contrary, is very often the direct cause of its reduction. 
Thus, technical progress, which signifies an increase in social wealth causes greater social in-equality in capitalist society, wid-ens the distance between the propertied and the propertyless,and increases the workers’ eco-nomic dependence on the capi-talists. 
 V. 
 With such a state of affairs in capitalist society and with the constantly growing mutualrivalry among the capitalist countries on the world market, the sale of commodities necessar-ily lags behind their production, and this periodically causes more or less severe industrial crisesattended by more or less lengthy periods of industrial stagnation, leading to a further *Reduced.

 Is it necessary to indicate the causes of crises in the programme? If so, the shortcoming is that two causes are indicat-ed: 1) greater social inequal-ity (“with such a state of affairs”, p.

 IX. 
 But the development of international exchange and the world market has established such close ties among all nationsof the civilised world, that this great goal can be attained only through the united efforts ofthe proletarians of all countries. 
 Hence the present-day working-class movement had to become,and has long become, an inter-national movement.

 And since the tsarist autoc-racy, which is the most out-standing remnant of the old serf-owning system and the mostharmful in respect of further social development, is wholly incompatible with these juridicalinstitutions, and since by its very nature it cannot but be the bitterest and most dangerousenemy of the proletarian emanci-pation movement, the Russian Social-Democrats advance astheir immediate political task the overthrow of the monarchy.

 DRAFT PROGRAMME OF THE RUSSIAN SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC LABOUR PARTY * [A] I. 
 Commodity production is ever more rapidly develop-ing in Russia, the capitalist mode of production becoming increasingly dominant in it. 
 II. 
 As the result of continuous technical progress, small-scale production is being ousted to an ever greater degreeby large-scale production. 
 The most important part of themeans of production (of the land and factories, tools and machinery, railways and other means of communication) is becoming concentrated in the hands of a relatively in-significant number of capitalists and big landowners astheir private property. 
 The independent small producers(peasants, handicraftsmen, and artisans) are being ruinedin growing numbers, losing their means of production and thus turning into proletarians, or else becoming servants and tributaries of capital. 
 Increasing numbers of working peopleare compelled to sell their labour-power and become wage-workers, who are dependent on the property-owners and bytheir labour create the wealth of the latter. 
 III. 
 The greater the degree of technical progress, the more the growth of the demand for labour-power lags behind the growth of its supply, and the greater are the opportuni-ties for the capitalists to intensify exploitation of the workers. 
Insecurity of existence and unemployment, the yoke of *The theoretical part of this programme constitutes the draft proposed by one of the editors, Frey3 (and drawn up by him on the basis of G. 
 V. 
 Plekhanov’s original draft). 
 The practical part of theprogramme (from the point indicated below to the end) is proposedby the whole committee, i. 
e. 
, by the five editors. 
 exploitation, and humiliation of every kind are becoming the lot of ever wider sections of the working population. 
 IV. 
 This process is being still more aggravated by industrial crises, which are the inevitable outcome of thebasic contradictions of capitalism. 
 Poverty and destitutionamong the masses exist side by side with wastage of socialwealth in consequence of the impossibility of finding marketsfor commodities produced. 
 V. 
 Thus, the gigantic development of the productive forces of social labour, which is constantly becoming moresocialised labour, is attended by monopolisation of all theprincipal advantages of this development by a negligibleminority of the population. 
 The growth of social wealthproceeds side by side with the growth of social inequality; the gulf between the class of property-owners (the bour-geoisie) and the class of the proletariat is growing. 
 [B] VI. 
 But as all these inevitable contradictions of capital-ism increase and develop, the number and the solidarity of the proletarians, their discontent and indignation also grow, the struggle between the working class and the capitalistclass becomes sharper, and the urge to throw off the intol-erable yoke of capitalism mounts. 
 VII. 
 The emancipation of the workers must be the act of the working class itself. 
 All the other classes of present-day society stand for the preservation of the foundations of the existing economic system. 
 The real emancipation of theworking class requires a social revolution—which is beingprepared by the entire development of capitalism—i. 
e. 
,the abolition of private ownership of the means of production,their conversion into public property, and the replacement of capitalist production of commodities by the socialist organisation of the production of articles by society as a whole,with the object of ensuring full well-being and free, all-round development for all its members. 
 VIII. 
 This proletarian revolution will completely abol-ish the division of society into classes and, consequently, all social and political inequality arising from that division. 
 IX. 
 To effect this social revolution the proletariat must win political power, which will make it master of the situa-tion and enable it to remove all obstacles along the road to its great goal. 
 In this sense the dictatorship of the proletariat is an essential political condition of the social revolution. 
 X. 
 Russian Social-Democracy undertakes the task of disclosing to the workers the irreconcilable antagonism be-tween their interests and those of the capitalists, of explainingto the proletariat the historical significance, nature, andprerequisites of the social revolution it will have to carry out, and of organising a revolutionary class party capable of directing the struggle of the proletariat in all its forms. 
 XI. 
 But the development of international exchange and of production for the world market has establishedsuch close ties among all nations of the civilised world,that the present-day working-class movement had to become, and has long become, an international movement. 
 That is why Russian Social-Democracy regards itself as one of thedetachments of the world army of the proletariat, as partof international Social-Democracy. 
 XII. 
 The immediate aims of Russian Social-Democracy are, however, considerably modified by the fact that in our country numerous remnants of the pre-capitalist, serf-owning social system, retard the development of the pro-ductive forces in the highest degree, render impossible thecomplete and all-round development of the proletariat’sclass struggle, and lower the working population’s standardof living; they are responsible for the Asiatically barbarous way in which the many-million-strong peasantry is dying out, and keep the entire people in a state of ignorance andsubjection, denying them all rights. 
 XIII. 
 The tsarist autocracy is the most outstanding of these remnants of the serf-owning system and the most for-midable bulwark of all this barbarism. 
 It is the bitterest and most dangerous enemy of the proletarian emancipation movement and the cultural development of the entire people. 
 [C] For these reasons * the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party advances as its immediate political task the over-throw of the tsarist autocracy and its replacement by a *Here begins the text adopted by the committee as a whole. 
 republic based on a democratic constitution that would ensure: 1) the people’s sovereignty, i. 
e. 
, concentration of supreme state power in the hands of a legislative assembly consistingof representatives of the people; 2) universal, equal, and direct suffrage, both in elections to the legislative assembly and in elections to alllocal organs of self-government, for every citizen who has reached the age of twenty-one; the secret ballot at all elections; the right of every voter to be elected to any of therepresentative assemblies; remuneration for representativesof the people; 3) inviolability of the person and domicile of citizens;4) unrestricted freedom of conscience, speech, the press and of assembly, the right to strike and to organise unions; 5) freedom of movement and occupation;6) abolition of social-estates; full equality for all citizens, irrespective of sex, religion or race; 7) recognition of the right to self-determination for all nations forming part of the state; 8) the right of every citizen to prosecute any official, without previously complaining to the latter’s superiors; 9) general arming of the people instead of maintaining a standing army; 10) separation of the church from the state and of the school from the church; 11) universal, free, and compulsory education up to the age of sixteen; state provision of food, clothing, and schoolsupplies to needy children. 
 [D] To protect the working class and to raise its fighting capacity, * the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party demands: 1) that the working day be limited to eight hours for all wage-workers; *Frey moved that the beginning of this paragraph be altered to read as follows: “To safeguard the working class from physical and moral degener-ation, and also to raise its fighting capacity in the struggle for itsemancipation.... 
” 2) that a weekly rest period of not less than thirty-six con-secutive hours for wage-workers of both sexes employed in all branches of the national economy be established by law; 3) that all overtime be prohibited;4) that night-work (from 9 p. 
m. 
 to 5 a. 
m. 
) in all branches of the national economy be prohibited, with the exceptionof those branches in which it is essential for technicalreasons; 5) that employers be forbidden to employ children under the age of fifteen; 6) that female labour be forbidden in industries specif-ically injurious to the health of women; 7) that the law establish employers’ civil liability for workers’ complete or partial disability caused by accidents or by harmful working conditions; that the worker should not be required to prove his employer’s responsibility fordisability; 8) that payment of wages in kind be prohibited *; 9) that state pensions be paid to aged workers, who have become incapacitated; 10) that the number of factory inspectors be increased; that female inspectors be appointed in industries in whichfemale labour predominates; that observance of the factorylaws be supervised by representatives elected by the work-ers and paid by the state; piece rates and rejection of workdone should also be supervised by elected representatives of the workers; 11) that local self-government bodies, in co-operation with elected representatives of the workers, supervise sanitaryconditions in living quarters provided for workers by employ-ers, and also see to the observance of rules operating insuch living quarters and the terms on which they are leased, with the object of protecting the wage-workers from employ-ers’ interference in their lives and activities as privatepersons and citizens; 12) that a properly organised and comprehensive system of health inspection be instituted to supervise working con-ditions at all enterprises employing wage-labour; *Frey moved that the following be inserted here (in the same clause): “that the law should establish weekly payment for all workersemployed on a contract basis. 
” 13) that the Factory Inspectorate’s activities be extended to artisan, home, and handicraft industries, and to state-owned enterprises; 14) that any breach of the labour protection laws be pun-ishable by law; 15) that employers be forbidden to make any deductions from wages, on any grounds or for any purpose whatsoever(fines, rejections, etc. 
); 16) that factory courts be set up in all branches of the national economy, with equal representation of workersand employers. 
 [E] Besides, with the object of democratising Russia’s state economy, the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party demands that all indirect taxation be abolished and progres-sive income-tax be introduced. 
 With a view to eradicating the remnants of the old serf-owning system, the Party will work for *: 1) abolition of land redemption and quit-rent payments, as well as of all services now imposed on the peasantry as a taxable social-estate; 2) annulment of collective liability4 and of all laws restricting the peasant in the free disposal of his land; 3) restitution to the people of all sums taken from them in the form of land redemption and quit-rent payments; con-fiscation for this purpose of monasterial property and of the royal demesnes, and imposition of a special land-tax onmembers of the big landed nobility who received landredemption loans, the revenue thus obtained to be creditedto a special public fund for the cultural and charitable needsof the village communes; 4) establishment of peasant committees a) for the restitution to the village communes (by ex-propriation, or, when the land has changed hands, by *Frey moved that the following words be inserted here: “and for the purpose of facilitating the free development of the class strugglein the countryside,” so that the whole paragraph would read as follows:“With a view to eradicating the remnants of the old serf-owning systemand for the purpose of facilitating the free development of the class struggle in the countryside, the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party will work for.

 [F] Working for the achievement of its immediate political and economic aims, * the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party supports every oppositional and revolutionary move-ment directed against the existing social and political order in Russia, but emphatically rejects all those reformist plans which depict every extension of police tutelage over theworking masses as a step towards the solution of the socialproblem.

” THREE AMENDMENTS TO THE DRAFT PROGRAMME No. 
 1. 
 In Paragraph (A) II, instead of: “As the result of continuous technical progress, small-scale production is beingousted to an ever greater degree by large-scale production” insert the following: “Technical progress is making constant headway, large-scale production is developing to an ever-increasing ex-tent, small-scale production is being ousted more and moreor is declining. 
” No. 
 2. 
 In Paragraph (B) VII, after: “All the other classes of present-day society stand for the preservation of the foun-dations of the existing economic system” insert:“and the small producer, who is being ruined under the yoke of capitalism, becomes truly revolutionary only tothe extent that he realises the hopelessness of his position and places himself at the standpoint of the proletariat”— and further begin with a new paragraph. 
No. 
 3. 
 In Paragraph (B) XII, instead of: “are responsible for the Asiatically barbarous way in which the many-mil-lion-strong peasantry is dying out” insert: “are responsible for the Asiatically barbarous forms of exploitation and the agonising extinction of the many-mil-lion-strong peasantry ”. 
 Written in the second half of February 1902 First page of Lenin’s manuscript, “Notes on Plekhanov’s Second Draft Programme”, 1902 Reduced First page of Lenin’s manuscript, “Notes on Plekhanov’s Second Draft Programme”, 1902 Reduced NOTES ON PLEKHANOV’S SECOND DRAFT PROGRAMME The entire character of the programme is, in my opinion, the most general and basic defect of this draft, one that makesit unacceptable. 
 Specifically, it is not the programme ofa party engaged in a practical struggle, but a Prinzipiener-klärung *; it is rather a programme for students (especially its most important section, which is devoted to a definitionof capitalism), moreover for first-year students, who areacquainted with capitalism in general, but not yet withRussian capitalism. 
 This basic defect leads also to a greatdeal of repetition, and the programme tends to become a commentary . 
 I shall endeavour to prove this by analysing the draft point by point, and shall then draw the generalconclusions. 
 “The development of international exchange”, etc. 
, to the words “has long become an international movement”(§I—for convenience in quoting I shall number each para-graph in consecutive order). 
 In essence there is nothing to which objection can be taken here. 
 Only the words: “the great emancipation movement ofour times” are superfluous, for the emancipatory nature ofthe working-class movement is dealt with below at lengthand concretely. 
 Further, in my opinion, this paragraph is not in its proper place. 
 The programme of the Russian Social-DemocraticParty should begin with a definition (and indictment) ofRussian capitalism—and only then stress the internation-al character of the movement, which in form—to use thewords of the Communist Manifesto —is of necessity at first a national struggle. 
 5 *A declaration of principles. 
— Ed. 
 § II. 
 “ Like the Social-Democrats of all other countries, the Russian Social-Democrats take an international stand . 
 They regard their Party as one of the detachments of the world army of the proletariat, as part of internationalSocial-Democracy”. 
 The words I have underlined are superfluous, since they add absolutely nothing to what has been said prior to andafter this. 
 These superfluous words merely weaken the wholly adequate and graphic expression of thought contained in the words “detachment” and “part”. 
 §III. 
 “They pursue the same ultimate aim as the Social-Democrats of all other countries. 
” These too are superfluous words, repeated t w i c e below in §§ XIII (“the ultimate aim of all the efforts of internation-al Social-Democracy”, etc. 
) and XVII (“the identity of the common ultimate aim”). 
 A “detachment” of an army is adetachment for the very reason that it pursues the same aim. 
 § IV. 
 “This ultimate aim, which is common to the Social-Democrats of all countries” (again superfluous repeti-tion), “is determined by bourgeois society’s nature and course of development. 
 ” Also superfluous words, precisely because it is shown further how bourgeois society’s nature and course of develop-ment “determine” this ultimate aim. 
 This paragraph is some-thing in the nature of a heading or section title. 
 But headings,which are necessary in textbooks or articles, are quite unnec-essary in a programme. 
 Alles , was im Programm überflüssig , schwächt es * (Engels in his notes on the draft of the Erfurt Programme). 
6 §§ V and VI (as well as the beginning of VII) evoke, in addition to formal remarks, one general and fundamentalobjection to the whole character of the programme as out-lined in the draft. 
 I shall first state this general objection (for which pur-pose it will be necessary in part to defend the counterdraft),and then I shall proceed to the formal remarks. 
 §V gives an academic definition of “developed” capitalism in general; §VI speaks of the “expansion” of capitalist pro-duction relations together with technical progress and the *All that is superfluous in a programme weakens it. 
— Ed. 
 growth of big enterprises to the detriment of small enter-prises (or at the expense of the latter), i. 
e. 
, as small-scale production is being ousted by large-scale production. 
 This method of exposition is illogical and incorrect. 
It is incorrect because the fighting proletariat learns what capitalism is, not from academic definitions (as one learnsfrom textbooks), but from practical acquaintance with thecontradictions of capitalism, with the development of society and its consequences. 
 And in our programme we must define this development, and state—as briefly and graphically aspossible—that matters are proceeding in a certain way . 
 We should leave to commentaries all explanations of whythings are proceeding in just this way and no other, and alldetails of the forms in which the basic tendencies find expres-sion. 
 As to what capitalism is—that will of itself follow from our definition of exactly how matters stand ( resp . 
 * are pro-ceeding). 
 It is illogical because the process of the ousting of small-scale production by large-scale production (§ VI) and that ofthe division of society into property-owners and proletarians (§V) are one and the same process . 
 And this is not expressed by the formulation given in the draft. 
 According to the draftwe have the following: First proposition . 
 Developed capi-talism consists in a considerable section of independent small-scale production having been ousted by large-scale produc-tion employing wage-workers. 
 Second proposition . 
 The dom-ination of capitalism spreads in the degree that large-scale production ousts small-scale production.... 
 In my opinion, these two paragraphs should be combined in one, for the reason indicated, and the process shouldbe expressed as follows: technical progress—the oustingof small-scale production by large-scale production—the concentration of the means of production in the hands of the capitalists and the landowners—the ruin of the inde-pendent small producers: their conversion into proletariansor into dependents of capital. 
 The following objections are raised to this formulation (which the counterdraft has attempted to give): (1) It alleges that the ruin of the Russian peasantry ( resp. 
 *Respective (Lat. 
). 
— Ed. 
 the formation of large-scale landownership in Russia, etc. 
) depends solely on the growth of capitalism. 
 This objection is, I believe, groundless. 
 It is stated quite clearly in the appropriate place (viz. 
, at the end of theprogramme) that there exists in our country a host of remnantsof the serf-owning system, and that these remnants “barba-rise” the process of development. 
 But once we consider theprocess of the development of capitalism the basic process in Russia’s social and economic evolution, we must begin precisely by describing this process, as well as its contradic-tions and consequences. 
 Only in this way can we give graph-ic expression to our thought that the process of the develop-ment of capitalism, the ousting of small-scale production,the concentration of property, etc. 
, is proceeding and will continue, despite all the remnants of the serf-owning system, and through all these remnants. 
 (2) It is said that the proposition “small-scale production is being ousted to an ever greater degree by large-scale pro-duction” is “too categorical”, “stereotyped”, etc. 
 I must, therefore, explain the reasons which lead me to consider this formulation no less correct and far more apt than the formulation given in the draft under discussion:“an increase in the economic importance of the big enter-prises, a decrease in the relative number of the small enter-prises, reduction of their role in the social and economiclife of the country. 
” From the purely theoretical aspect, both these formulations are absolutely identical in meaning , and all attempts to estab-lish a difference in substance between them are wholly arbi-trary. 
 * “An increase in the importance of the big and the reduction of the role of the small”—is equivalent to ousting . 
 Ousting can consist in nothing else. 
 The complexity and confusion in the question of small-scale production being ousted by large-scale production do not at all depend on anyone being unable (in good faith) to understand thatousting means “an increase in the importance of the big and *We would challenge anyone who does not agree with this to cite or even imagine a single example of any “increase in the economic importance of the big enterprises and reduction of the role of thesmall enterprises” that would not make it obvious that the latter are being ousted by the former. 
 reduction of the role of the small”—but depend wholly and exclusively on the difficulty of agreement on a choice of the indices and symptoms of the ousting, resp. 
 of the increase in the importance of the one, resp. 
 the reduction of the role of the other. 
 In its most general form, the process of the development of capitalism in this respect may be expressed as follows: Initial period : Total production = 100. 
 Large-scale = a. 
 Small-scale = 100 — a. 
 Subsequent period. 
 Total production = 200. 
 Large-scale = 2a & b. 
 Small-scale = 200 — 2a — b. 
 It can be said with confidence that all and every kind of data on the proportional relation between large-scale and small-scale production will fit into this formula. 
 Nobodyout to understand the process can doubt that this is indeedousting . 
 Whether 200 — 2a — b will be greater in size than 100 — a (relative ousting) or smaller (absolute ousting)— this is ousting in any case . 
 Only a “critic” who does not wish to understand this will be “unable to understand”—and such people are very hard to please. 
 Moreover, the commen-tary will give the proper rebuff to such people. 
 The difficulty of the question does not at all lie in under-standing that the indicated modification is equivalent to“ousting”, but in the exact definition of the magnitudes 100, a, etc. 
 This is a concrete question, a question of fact, and the formulation: “an increase in the importance and the reduc-tion of the role” does not bring us a hair’s breadth closerto its solution. 
 For example, in the overwhelming majority of cases , all European industrial statistics determine this “importance” and this “role” by the number of workers (and agrarian sta-tistics do so by the amount of land ). 
 And no one has yet ventured to doubt that a decrease in the proportionate number of workers ( resp . 
 the amount of land) means precisely ousting . 
 The trouble, however, is that very often such indices as the number of workers ( resp . 
 the amount of land) are insufficient . 
 Small enterprises may be ousted , while the number of workers there (the amount of land) increases —if, for instance, these workers are handling outside materials, or if this land is cultivated by inferior draught animals, or by workers in inferior conditions, or is cultivated and fertilised in a worse way, and so on, and so forth. 
 It is common knowledge that the “critical” arguments against “Marxist dogma” teemwith just such “misunderstandings”, and these “misunder-standings ” are not eliminated one iota by saying “an increase in the importance and the reduction of the role” instead of“ousting”, since it is “generally accepted” that the “impor-tance” and “role” are expressed quite simply by the number of workers and the amount of land. 
 No one will doubt that such processes as the differentia-tion of the peasantry, increasing use of machinery especiallyby big proprietors, improvements in the stock of draughtanimals used by the big proprietors and deterioration of that used by smallholders (the substitution of cows for horses, etc. 
), growing “importunities” of the hired worker atthe big enterprises and the longer working hours there, resp . 
 the small peasant’s diminishing consumption, improved culti-vation and fertilisation of the big proprietor’s land, and poorercultivation and fertilisation of the smallholder’s land, the big proprietor’s advantage over the latter in the field of credits and association, and so on and so forth—all these are preciselyan ousting of small-scale production by large-scale production (in agriculture). 
 It is not at all difficult (or even necessary)to prove that all these processes amount to “ousting”—itis difficult to prove that it is precisely to these processes that attention should be paid, that these processes are actually taking place . 
 This difficulty is not made easier in the least by the words: “an increase in the importance and the reductionof the role”; it can be made easier only by a commentary, only by examples of how people are unable to define (do not want to define) the true expression of the process of ousting ( =an increase in the importance and the reduction of the role). 
 It is a sheer illusion to imagine that the words “an increase in the importance and the reduction of the role” are deeper,more meaningful, and broader than the “narrow” and“stereotyped” word “ousting”. 
 These words do not contributein the least towards a more profound understanding of the process—they merely express this process more hazily and more vaguely . 
 And the reason I am contesting these words so vigorously is not because they are theoretically incorrect, but just because they lend an appearance of profundity to sheer haziness . 
 A person who has “attended a seminary” and nothing more and is aware that a proportionate decrease (and not neces-sarily an absolute decrease) is tantamount to ousting willsee in this haziness a desire to cover up the nakedness of the“Marxist dogma”, which has been compromised by the crit-ics. 
 * A person who has not attended a seminary will only sigh over such masterly and “fathomless wisdom”—whereas the word “ousting” will remind every worker and every peas-ant of scores and hundreds of familiar instances. 
 It is noharm if he does not immediately grasp the full import ofthis expression: selbst wenn einmal ein Fremdwort oder ein nicht auf den ersten Blick in seiner ganzen Tragweite zu erfassender Satz vorkommt , schadet das nichts. 
 Der münd-liche Vortrag in den Versammlungen , die schriftliche Er-klärung in der Presse tut da alles Nötige , und der kurze , prägnante Satz befestigt sich dann , einmal verstanden , im Gedächtniss , wird Schlagwort , und das passiert der breiteren Auseinandersetzung nie . 
 ** (Engels in his criticism of the Erfurt Draft. 
) From the standpoint of style, too, the words “an increase in the importance and the reduction of the role” instead of“ousting” are undesirable. 
 This is not the language of a rev-olutionary party, but the language of Russkiye Vedomosti . 
 7 This is the terminology not of socialist propaganda, but of a statistical abstract. 
 These words seem, as it were, deliberately chosen with a view to giving the reader theimpression that the process described is a mild one, culmi-nating in nothing definite, a painless process. 
 Since in real-*Such an interpretation of haziness is all the more inevitable the more widely such a definite formulation as, for instance, in theErfurt Programme, becomes known: “... geht die Verdrängung der zersplitterten Kleinbetriebe durch kolossale Grossbetriebe .... 
” (“... the scattered small enterprises are being ousted by colossal large-scale enterprises...”— Ed. 
) **There is no harm in one’s occasionally coming across a foreign word or a sentence whose full import one cannot grasp at first glance. 
Oral reports at meetings and written statements in the press do allthat is necessary, and a brief but pithy sentence, once understood,will impress itself on the mind and become a slogan, which is never the case with a broader exposition. 
— Ed. 
 ity the reverse is true, these words are to that extent quite wrong. 
 We cannot and should not choose the most abstract formulations, for what we are writing is not an article direct-ed against the critics, but the programme of a militantparty, which makes its appeal to the masses of handi-craftsmen and peasants. 
 In this appeal, we must sayklipp und klar * that capital “makes servants and tributa-ries of them”, “ruins” them and “ousts” them, driving them into the ranks of the proletariat. 
 This is the only formulation that would be a true expression of what every handicrafts-man and every peasant knows from thousands of instances. 
And only this formulation will inevitably suggest the con-clusion: your only salvation lies in joining the party of theproletariat. 
 In passing to the formal remarks against § V and § VI, I shall note the following. 
 §V speaks of bourgeois society “in developed form”, and at the same time states that both a “section of the artisans”and “the small peasantry” have survived in this society. 
What follows is an inaccuracy. 
 If one is to understand the words “developed form” in a strictly theoretical sense, then there will be neither artisans nor small peasants in such asociety. 
 And even if these words are taken in their usual senseto mean the most developed countries—even then we will find that in Britain, for example, “the small peasantry” as aseparate section of society has in essence practically ceased to exist. 
 “The domination of commodity production on the basis of capitalist production relations. 
” That is rather incon-gruous. 
 Of course, fully developed commodity production is possible only in capitalist society, but “commodity produc-tion” in general is both logically and historically prius to capitalism. 
 The term “capitalist production relations” is not used con-sistently in the draft. 
 It is occasionally replaced by theterm “the capitalist mode of production” (§ XI). 
 To lessenthe difficulty of understanding the programme, one termshould, in my opinion, be used throughout, namely, the latter, since the former is more theoretical, and without the *Clearly and distinctly. 
— Ed. 
 addition of the word “system”, etc. 
 (of relations), does not indicate anything complete or integral. 
 “The feudal-handicraft period.... 
” Here, an expression seems to have been chosen, as though deliberately, which is leastapplicable to Russia, for it is questionable whether the term“feudalism” is applicable to our Middle Ages. 
 And yet, thedescription given of “developed” bourgeois society is in substance applicable to Russia as well (independent small producers and the small peasants “have survived”, they sell “their labour-power periodically or constantly”, etc. 
). 
 Hence,by its own formulation the draft refutes the opinion thatno definition of the development of capitalism can be writ-ten, which will clearly and directly have Russia in view. 
 “The small producers, artisan-producers, who work to order.... 
” To order from consumers or from the merchants who give out work? Probably the former. 
 But precisely inRussia most small producers in industry work for the marketand not to order. 
 “... The major part of the articles of consumption”... (why not also “of the means of production”?)... “is produced for sale on the home or world market .... 
” The words underlined are unnecessary repetition, since the increase in internationalexchange is dealt with in §1. 
 “... The means of production and of circulation ” of commodi-ties. 
 I believe that the words underlined should be trans-ferred from the programme to the commentary, since one can infer that the capitalists own the means of circulation from the fact that they own the means of production in a society witha commodity economy. 
 “... Of persons who possess no means of production and of circulation except their labour-power .... 
” That is not the way to put it. 
 The reference to “constant or periodical” sale of labour-power—“for a whole year or several months”—is a super-fluous detail, which should be transferred to the commentary. 
 (§ VI) “... An increase in the economic importance of the big industrial enterprises”—and below: the reduction of the role of independent small producers in general. 
 Is the omission of big agricultural enterprises accidental? Or was it intended to say that the economic importance ofbig enterprises increases only in industry, whereas the role of small enterprises is diminishing both in industry and in agriculture? If the latter is the case—then that would be absolutely wrong . 
 The “economic importance of the big enterprises” is increasing in agriculture too (it will sufficeto mention machinery as one example—and other examplesare given above). 
 Naturally, the process here is immeasur-ably more complex , but this will have to be said (and said with concrete explanations) in the commentary. 
 ... Dependent “more or less completely, more or less obvious-ly, more or less onerously...”—these are words which, inmy opinion, are redundant and weaken the meaning. 
 Thephrasing in the original draft—“servants and tributaries”—is stronger and more graphic. 
 § VII begins with superfluous reiteration, again refer-ring to the “conversion of the small producers into proletar-ians”, although this has already been noted in §§ V and VI. 
 §VII gives an elaborate explanation of the fact that the growth of the demand for labour-power lags behind thegrowth of its supply. 
 The exposition, in this case, can hardlybenefit from such “elaborateness”. 
 In any case, no full ex-planation of the process is, of course, given (e. 
g. 
, mention is made of the growing employment of female and child labour,but no mention is made of the growing intensification oflabour, etc. 
). 
 It would therefore be more correct to refer all explanations (with concrete examples) to the commentary,and to formulate in the programme only what the contradic-tion of capitalism consists in and what its tendency is. 
 The objection is raised that, by saying that “the greater the degree of technical progress, the more the growth ofthe demand for labour-power lags behind the growth of itssupply”, the question is presented in an incorrect light,since the “growth of supply” is far from being dependent on “technical progress” alone. 
 But this objection is not sound, for the words “the greater—the more” are by no means equiv-alent to the words “since—consequently”. 
 The precedingparagraph explains what causes the “growth of supply” (“ruin”, “ousting”, etc. 
), and this will be explained more con-cretely in the commentary. 
 “... The share of the working class in the sum-total of the material wealth created by its labour is constantly dimin-ishing.... 
” These words appear in the paragraph dealing with the intensification of exploitation (compare the quotation with the text directly preceding it). 
 One might think there-fore that what is meant by “share” is the relation of v t o v&m. 
 But in that event this is superfluous and does not correspond to the words “sum-total of wealth”. 
 If, however, the sum-total = c&v&m, then, first, it is not quite proper to term c&m (as against v) the “share”, for by “share” is meant what is shared, i. 
e. 
, articles of consump-tion. 
 Further, in that case this proposition belongs in substan-ce to the next paragraph, which deals with the increase insocial wealth (c &v&m) and social inequality. 
 In view of this, it would be better to omit the words quoted as super-fluous repetition. 
 Moreover, these words, as formulated, presuppose a society that is so developed as to consist only of wage-workers and cap-italists [for the share of the small producers also decreases],and this does not accord with § V, which keeps smallproducers in a “developed” society too. 
 §VIII should come after §§ IX and X: these latter deal with crises, i. 
e. 
, with one of the contradictions of capitalism, whereas § VIII sums up all the contradictions of capitalism and all tendencies in its development. 
 To the words “increase in the productivity of labour” should be added: “of social labour, which is constantly be-coming more socialised labour”. 
 The draft speaks in thewrong place of the process of the socialisation of labour (§XI) and in too narrow a form (“the process of technical progress combines the workers’ labour more and more”). 
Capitalism’s socialisation of labour does not consist solelyin the “combination of the labour of the workers”. 
 The words: “A widening of the distance between the prop-ertied and the propertyless” following the words “an increase in social inequality” are a superfluous repetition. 
 On the other hand, reference to the “growing gulf” between the proletariatand the bourgeoisie must of necessity be added so as to definethe chief social consequence of all the indicated contradic-tions of capitalism and pass over to the class struggle. 
 Incidentally, with regard to a definition of the social con-sequences of capitalism, it must be stated that here partic-ularly the draft suffers from abstractness , limiting itself as it does to the utterly inadequate proposition: “multiplication of the difficulties in the struggle for existence and of all the privations and sufferings attendant on this struggle”. 
 In my opinion it is absolutely essential to indicate more defi-nitely those social consequences which weigh most heavily both upon the working class and the small producers. 
 An objection raised against the formulation of these consequences in the counterdraft, is, for instance, that thewords “humiliation of every kind” are not true. 
 I believe they are true, embracing as they do such phenomena as prostitution , the conversion of the “intelligentsia” into mere hirelings, the conversion of the worker into a seller of hiswife and children, submission to the iron discipline of capi-tal, the use of economic power for political oppression, forpressure on the freedom of opinion, and so on and so forth. 
 In exactly the same way it seems to me absolutely essential to point to the “poverty and destitution of themasses” under capitalism. 
 I am not proposing to speak of theabsolute growth of poverty and destitution, but I fully shareKautsky’s opinion that “ ein ausführliches s. 
-d. 
 Programm , welches nicht erkennen lässt , dass der Kapitalismus naturnot-wendig Massenarmut und Massenelend erzeugt , das nicht als den Inhalt des Strebens der Sd-tie den Kampf gegen dieseArmut und dieses Elend bezeichnet , verschweigt die entschei-dende Seite unserer Bewegung und enthält also eine empfind-liche Lücke ” * (against the Austrian draft). 
 It is just as essential, as I see it, to point out that “all the principal” (hence, not absolutely all) “advantages of the pro-cess of development of the productive forces are monopolisedby a negligible minority of the population”. 
 §§IX and X deal with crises. 
 In view of the changed for-mulation, there is nothing in substance here to which excep-tion could be taken. 
 In form, however, these paragraphs suffer from repetitions (again “world market”, again “capital-ist production relations”). 
 It would be far better to complete-ly delete from the programme an attempt to explain crises, *“... a detailed Social-Democratic programme which does not make it clear that capitalism must naturally lead to mass povertyand mass destitution, and does not regard the struggle against thispoverty and this destitution as the content of Social-Democracy’s aspirations, ignores the decisive aspect of our movement and thus has a conspicuous deficiency”. 
— Ed. 
 limiting it to noting that they are inevitable, and leaving explanation and elaboration to the commentary. 
 As it is, reference is made, for example, to crises and to “periods of stagnation”, but on the whole the entire cycle of capitalistindustry is not encompassed in any way. 
 The social consequences of crises are indicated, but again with repetitions (it is enough to mention the “aggravation”of the process, etc. 
) and again too vaguely: crises not only render the position of the small producers difficult, not only lead to the relative and absolute deterioration of their con-ditions, but actually ruin them and drive them into theranks of the proletariat. 
 Against §§ XI and XII I have an extremely important objection in principle: these paragraphs present the rela-tion of the proletariat to the small producers in an alto-gether one-sided and incorrect way (for “the working and exploited masses” consist of precisely the proletariat and thesmall producers). 
 The two paragraphs are directly at vari-ance with the fundamental theses of the Communist Mani-festo , the General Rules of the International 8, and the majority of present-day Social-Democratic programmes; they leave the way open to Narodnik, “critical”, and all sorts ofpetty-bourgeois misapprehensions. 
 “... The discontent of the working and exploited masses is growing”—that is true, but it is absolutely incorrect toidentify the proletariat’s discontent with that of the small producer, and merge the two as has been done here. 
 The small producers’ discontent very often engenders (and inev-itably must engender in them or among a considerable sec-tion of them) an urge to defend their existence as small proprietors , i. 
e. 
, to defend the foundations of the present-day order, and even to turn it back. 
 “... Their struggle and, above all, the struggle of their fore-most representative, the proletariat, is becoming sharp-er.... 
” The struggle is growing sharper among the smallproducers too, of course. 
 But their “struggle” is very often directed against the proletariat, for in many respects the very position of the small producers sharply contraposes their interests to those of the proletariat. 
 Generally speaking, the proletariat is not at all the petty bourgeoisie’s “foremost rep-resentative”. 
 If that does occur, it is only when the small producers realise that their doom is inevitable, when they “d e s e r t their own standpoint to place themselves at that of the proletariat”. 
 It happens very often, on the other hand, that the anti-Semite and the big landowner, the nationalistand the Narodnik, the social-reformer and the “critic ofMarxism” are the foremost representatives of the present-day small producer who has not yet deserted “his own standpoint”. 
It is least of all appropriate to lump together each and every kind of sharpening, particularly at the present time, when the “sharpening of the struggle” of the small producers isaccompanied by “sharpening of the struggle” of the “socialistGironde” against the “Mountain”. 
 9 “... International Social-Democracy stands at the head of the emancipation movement of the working and exploited masses .... 
” Not at all. 
 It stands at the head of the working c l a s s alone , of the working-class movement alone, and if other elements join this class these are only elements and notclasses. 
 And they come over completely and absolutelyonly when they “desert their own standpoint”. 
 “... It organises t h e i r fighting forces.... 
” Wrong again. 
 Nowhere does Social-Democracy organise the “fighting forces” of the small producers. 
 It organises the fighting forcesof the working class alone. 
 The formulation chosen in thedraft is all the less appropriate the less it applies to Russia, the more restricted the exposition (cf. 
 §V) is to “ d e v e l -o p e d ” bourgeois society. 
 Summa summarum . 
 The draft speaks in positive form of the revolutionary spirit of the petty bourgeoisie (if it “sup-ports” the proletariat, does this not signify that it is revolu-tionary?) without a single word about its conservatism (andeven reactionary spirit). 
 This is entirely one-sided andincorrect. 
 We can (and must) point in positive form to the conser-vatism of the petty bourgeoisie. 
 And o n l y i n c o n d i -t i o n a l f o r m should we point to its revolutionary spirit . 
 Only such a formulation will coincide in full with the entire spirit of Marx’s teachings. 
 For example, the Commu-nist Manifesto declares outright that “of all the classes that stand face to face with the bourgeoisie ... the proletariat alone is a really revolutionary class.... 
 The small manufac-turer ... the artisan, the peasant ... are not revolutionary , but conservative . 
 Nay more, they are reactionary.... 
 If by chance they are revolutionary, [“if”] * they are so only in view of their impending transfer into the proletariat ... they d e s e r t their own standpoint to place themselves at that of the proletariat”. 
10 Let it not be said that matters have changed substan-tially in the half century since the Communist Man-ifesto . 
 It is precisely in this respect that nothing has changed: and theoreticians have always and constantly recog-nised this proposition (for instance, Engels in 1894 refutedthe French agrarian programme from this very standpoint. 
 11 He stated outright that until the small peasant deserts hi s standpoint, he is not with us; his place is with the anti-Semites; let them put him through the mill, and the more the bourgeois parties dupe him, the more surely he will come over to us)—moreover, history furnishes a wealth of factualconfirmation of this theory, right down to the most recenttimes, right down to nos chers amis , Messrs. 
 the “Critics”. 
 Besides, reference to the dictatorship of the proletariat contained in the original draft is missing here. 
 Even if this were done accidentally, through an oversight, it is still indubitable that the concept of “dictatorship” is incompatiblewith positive recognition of outside support for the proletar-iat. 
 If we really knew positively that the petty bourgeoi-sie will support the proletariat in the accomplishment of its,the proletariat’s, revolution it would be pointless to speak of a “dictatorship”, for we would then be fully guaran-teed so overwhelming a majority that we could get on verywell without a dictatorship (as the “critics” would have usbelieve). 
 The recognition of the necessity for the dictator-ship of the proletariat is most closely and inseparably bound up with the thesis of the Communist Manifesto that the pro-letariat alone is a really revolutionary class. 
 (Parenthetically—just how “jealous” Engels was about this part is evident from the following passus from his crit-icism of the Erfurt Draft. 
 “ Der Ruin welter Volksschich-ten,” ** Engels cites from the draft, and remarks; “ statt *Interpolations in square brackets (within passages quoted by Lenin) have been introduced by Lenin, unless otherwise indicated. 
— Ed. 
 **The ruin of the broad masses of the people. 
”— Ed. 
 dieser deklamatorischen Phrase , die aussieht als täte uns der Ruin von Bourgeois und Kleinbürgern noch leid [!!], würde ich die einfache Tatsache erzählen : die durch den Ruin der städtischen und ländlichen Mittelstände , der Kleinbürger und Kleinbauern , den Abgrund zwischen Besitzenden und Besitz-losen erweitern oder vertiefen . 
”*) I may be told that the counterdraft gives positive expres-sion to the small producer’s conservatism (“all the other classes of present-day society stand for the preservation of the foundations of the existing economic system”), whereasrevolutionariness is not expressed even conditionally . 
 This objection is entirely unfounded. 
 The small producer’s conditional revolutionariness is expressed in the counter-draft in the only way it can be expressed, i. 
e. 
, in the word-ing of the indictment against capitalism . 
 The conditional revolutionariness of the small producer is expressed: (1)—in the words about his ousting and ruin by capitalism. 
 We, the proletariat, accuse capitalism of bringing about *(“in place of this declamatory phrase, which sounds as if we were in fact distressed by the ruin of the bourgeois and the pettybourgeois [!!], I would state the simple fact: through the ruin of theurban and rural middle estates—the petty bourgeois and the small peasants—the gulf between the propertied and the propertyless grows. 
— Ed. 
) 12 The Erfurt draft programme contained the following passus : “In diesem Befreiungskampf verficht die Sozialdemokratie als die Ver-fechterin (or Vertreterin —Neue Zeit ,13 IX, 2, 789) nicht bloss der Lohnarbeiter , sondern der Ausgebeuteten und Unterdrückten insgesamt , alle Forderungen , Massregeln und Einrichtungen , welche die Lage des Volkes vm allgemetnen und der Arbeiterklasse im besondern zu verbesserngeeignet sind . 
” [“In this struggle for emancipation, Social-Democracy fights as the champion (or representative) not only of the wage-workers,but of all the exploited and oppressed, for all demands, measures, andinstitutions that could improve the position of the people in general, and of the working class in particular. 
”— Ed. 
] And Engels positively advised that this entire passus be deleted , asking sarcastically: “ des Volkes im allgemeinen (wer ist das ?)” [“The people in general (what does that mean?). 
”— Ed. 
] And, in accordance with Engels’ advice, this passus was completely scrapped ; the paragraph stating that “the emancipation of the workers must be the act of the working class itself, since a l l the o t h e r classes stand for private ownership of the means of production and have the common aim of preservingthe foundations of present-day society— under the direct influence of Engels this paragraph was adopted in a sharper form than in the ori-ginal draft. 
 large-scale production through the ruin of the peasant. 
 Hence, the direct conclusion that if the peasant grasps the inevitability of this process, he will “desert his own stand-point and place himself at ours”. 
 (2)—in the words: “Insecurity of existence and unem-ployment, the yoke of exploitation, and humiliation of everykind and becoming the lot” (not only of the proletariat, but)“of ever wider sections of the working population. 
” This very formulation expresses the fact that the proletariat pro-vides representation of the entire working population, and moreover a representation under which we urge (and compel ) all to desert their own standpoint and place themselves at ours, and not vice versa —we do not desert our own stand-point, and we do not merge our class struggle with the strug-gle of all sorts of weathercocks. 
 And the idea of representation is expressed in exactly the same way (3)—in the words about the poverty and destitution of the masses (the masses in general, and not the workers alone). 
 It is o n l y i n s u c h f o r m that the party of the revolutionary class can express the conditional revolution-ariness of the other classes, in order to lay before them i t s understanding of their destitution and the way to remedythat destitution, and, in i t s declaration of war on capital-ism, to speak not only in its own name, but in the name ofall the “poverty-stricken and destitute” masses. 
 Hence it follows that whoever accepts this doctrine must join us. 
 It would be simply ridiculous for us to make a special pointof this in the programme and declare that if certain unreli-able elements adopt our standpoint they too will be revolu-tionary! That would be the best way to destroy faith in usprecisely among those half-hearted and flabby allies who, as it is, lack faith in us. 
 * *The more “indulgence” we show, in the practical part of our programme, towards the small producer (e. 
g. 
, to the peasant), the“more strictly” must we treat these unreliable and double-faced socialelements in the theoretical part of the programme, without sacrificing one iota of o u r standpoint. 
 Now then, we say, if you adopt this, our, standpoint, you can count on “indulgence” of every kind, but if youdon’t, well then, don’t get angry with us! Under the “dictatorship”we shall say about you: there is no point in wasting words where theuse of power is required.... 
 /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR In addition to this objection to §§ XI and XII in principle, I also have a minor formal remark to make against § XI. 
 This is not the proper place to speak about the “ material possibility of doing away with capitalism”; what this para-graph deals with is not the material but the ideological prerequisites for capitalism to be done away with. 
 If thematerial prerequisites are mentioned, then reference shouldalso be made to the ideological (moral, etc. 
) prerequisites. 
 It would, however, be far more correct to transfer this “ma-terial possibility” to the paragraph that deals with capital-ism’s evolution and tendencies, and not with the classstruggle. 
 It is illogical to speak in § XII of the forthcoming social revolution—and only in § XV of this revolution itself and the necessity for it. 
 The order should be reversed. 
 In § XIII, the substitution of the expression “expropri-ation of the exploiters” for the words “abolition (or elimina-tion) of private ownership” is, in my opinion, not a happyone. 
 It is less clear and precise. 
 Nor is the end of the para-graph properly expressed: “the planned organisation of the social process of production so as to satisfy the needs of society as a whole, as well as its individual members”. 
 Thatis not enough. 
 Organisation of that kind will, perhaps, beprovided even by the trusts. 
 It would be more definite to say“by society as a whole ” (for this covers planning and indicates who is responsible for that planning), and not merely to satisfy the needs of its members, but with the object of ensuring full well-being and free, all-round development for a l l the members of society. 
 § XIV is, in my opinion, indefinite (I do not yet know whether we shall emancipate “all” oppressed “humanity”:as, for instance, the oppression of people of weak character by those of very strong character). 
 If would be better to use the formulation given by Marx in his criticism of the GothaProgramme: the abolition of division into classes and of theinequality arising therefrom. 
 14 Engels too, in his criticism of the Erfurt Programme, insisted that die Abschaflung der Klassen ist unsere Grundforderung ,* and that only by a precise and outright reference to this “fundamental demand” *The abolition of classes is our fundamental demand. 
15—Ed. 
 shall we impart an absolutely definite (and not exaggerated) meaning to our promises to emancipate all and to rid all of all evils. 
 § XV—I have already dealt above with “support of the proletariat by other sections of the population” and withthe omission of the “dictatorship of the proletariat”. 
 § XVI is altogether strange and out of place. 
 “The polit-ical education” of the proletariat consists in our enlighten-ing it, organising it and directing its struggle—and that has already been dealt with in §XII (to which only “leader-ship of its struggle” should be added). 
 § XVII also seems to me superfluous verbosity. 
 What is the point of speaking generally about the dependence of ourimmediate tasks on various social and political situations? Let this be dealt with in treatises, whereas we should say plainly that certain definite peculiarities (remnants of serf-ownership, the autocracy, etc. 
) modify our immediate taskin a certain definite way. 
 § XVIII: “In Russia capitalism is more and more becoming the predominant mode of production.... 
” That is unquestion-ably insufficient. 
 It has already become predominant (if I say that 60 has already become predominant over 40,it does not at all mean that 40 does not exist or that ithas been reduced to insignificance). 
 We still have so manyNarodniks, pro-Narodnik liberals, and “critics” rapidlyreverting to Narodnik ideas that it is impermissible to leave room for the slightest vagueness on this point. 
 And if capi-talism has not yet even become “predominant”, then it wouldbe better perhaps to wait awhile with Social-Democracy aswell. 
 “... advancing Social-Democracy to the very first place .... 
” Capitalism is only just becoming predominant, but we are already in the “very first” place.... 
 In my opinion, we should not talk at all about the very first place: that is self-evidentfrom the entire programme. 
 Let us leave it to history to saythis about us, rather than say it ourselves. 
 The draft evidently rejects the expression: the old, serf-owning social system, considering the expression “serf-owner-ship” applicable only to the legal structure. 
 I believe that this distinction is groundless: “serf-ownership” was, of course,a juridical institution, but it also corresponded to a specific system of landlord (and peasant) economy , and, besides, it manifested itself in numerous day-by-day relationships that were not provided for “by law”. 
 For this reason it is scarcely advisable to avoid the expression: “the pre-capital-ist, serf-owning social system”. 
 The “description” of serfdom (that the masses were, so to speak, baptised chattels) is utterly out of place and super-fluous in our programme. 
 On the other hand, it is insufficient to say about the influence of the remnants of the serf-owning system that theyweigh heavily upon the mass of working people. 
 We mustalso indicate the retardation in the development of the coun-try’s productive forces, and other social consequences ofserfdom. 
 * § XIX. 
 In my opinion, it is quite superfluous to state that to us democracy ( resp . 
 political liberty) is a “transitional stage” (transitional to what? After all, we openly say below thata republic is our immediate practical demand)—and that a constitution is “the natural legal complement [“property”of—obviously a mistake in copying] to capitalist production relations”. 
 This is absolutely out of place in the programme. 
 It would be wholly sufficient for us to say that the autocracyretards or restricts “ a l l social development”: hence, the development of capitalism is also incompatible with it. 
Details on this score should be relegated to the commentary,for in the programme they even weaken our declaration of war on the autocracy, imparting a bookish and abstract air to the programme. 
 Moreover, what is the point of these general passages about legal complements to capitalism and about a “legalstructure” (§ XX), when later we speak much more directlyand definitely about a republic? (Besides, § XX contains the expression “the old serf-owning system”, i. 
e. 
, here the draft itself attributes to the word “serf-ownership” a broadermeaning than the purely juridical. 
) Nor is there any point in speaking about the autocracy being incompatible with a legal structure, since thedemand for the former’s overthrow and replacement by a *Incidentally. 
 The expression in the counterdraft: “the Asiatically barbarous way in which the peasantry is dying out ” is a poor one. 
 Way of disappearance, or something like that, could be said. 
 republic follows immediately. 
 It would be better to express ourselves more definitely about the people’s “lack of rights” under the autocracy, etc. 
 “... The autocracy is the bitterest enemy of the aspirations of the working class towards emancipation.... 
” To this shouldbe added: “and of the cultural development of the wholepeople,” or words to that effect. 
 In this way (and not bytalking about “representation”) we shall indicate that Social-Democracy represents the interests not only of the working class, but of all social progress. 
 Summing up all the above notes, I find four basic short-comings in the draft, which, in my opinion, render it unac-ceptable: 1) extreme abstractness of many of the formulations, so that they might seem intended for a series of lectures ratherthan for a militant party; 2) evasion and obscuring of the question of specifically Russian capitalism are a particularly serious shortcoming, since the programme should provide a compendium and guide for agitation against Russian capitalism. 
 We must come outwith a direct appraisal of Russian capitalism and with anopen declaration of war against it specifically; 3) the altogether one-sided and incorrect presentation of the relation of the proletariat to the small producers , which cuts the ground from under our feet in the war against the “critics” and many others; 4) the constant endeavour in the programme to give explanations of the process. 
 The explanations fail in their purpose anyway, and the exposition becomes prolix,numerous repetitions occur, and the programme constantly lapses into a commentary. 
 Written in late February-early March 1902 OPINION ON PLEKHANOV ’S SECOND DRAFT Four basic shortcomings pervade the whole draft and, in my opinion, make it entirely unacceptable: 1) In the manner of formulation of the most important section, which contains a definition of capitalism, this draftis a programme of an economic textbook on capitalism in gen-eral rather than a programme for the proletariat, which isfighting against very real manifestations of a very definite capitalism. 
 2) The programme is particularly unsuitable for the party of the Russian proletariat, because the evolution of Russian capitalism and the antagonisms and social evilsengendered by Russian capitalism are almost entirely evad-ed and obscured by the selfsame system of defining capital-ism in general. 
 In its programme the party of the Russian proletariat should formulate in the most unambiguous manner its arraignment of Russian capitalism, its declaration ofwar on Russian capitalism. 
 This is all the more necessaryinasmuch as the Russian programme cannot be identical inthis respect with the European programmes: the latterspeak of capitalism and of bourgeois society without indi-cating that these concepts are equally applicable to Aus-tria, Germany, and so on, because that goes without saying. 
In relation to Russia this cannot be taken for granted. 
 To dispense with the question by saying that capitalism “in its developed form” is distinguished in general by such and such features—and in Russia capitalism “is becoming pre-dominant”—is to evade making the concrete arraignment and declaration of war that is most important for a partyengaged in a practical struggle. 
 That is why the draft fails to achieve one of the principal aims of a programme: to provide the Party with a directive for its day-by-day propaganda and agitation concerning all the various manifestations of Russian capitalism. 
 3) Some of the most important paragraphs are formulated in the draft with an inaccuracy which will inevitably engen-der most dangerous misinterpretations and hamper ourtheoretical struggle and propaganda. 
 Thus, for example, the growth of large-scale production is limited to “industrial” enterprises. 
 The evolution of agrarian capitalism is disre-garded or even evaded. 
 Further, instead of “the dic-tatorship of the proletariat” there is “the revolution whichthe proletariat will have to effect with the support of othersections of the population which are suffering from capital-ist exploitation”, and even the class struggle of the prole-tariat has been replaced by “the struggle of the working andexploited masses”. 
 This formulation contradicts the basicprinciple of the International: “The emancipation of the work-ers must be the act of the working class itself. 
” Besides theproletariat, the other part of the “working and exploited masses” (i. 
e. 
, mainly the small producers) is only partially revolutionary in its struggle against the bourgeoisie. 
 It is rev-olutionary only when, “with a view to joining the proletar-iat”, it “ places itself at the standpoint of the proletariat ” (The Communist Manifesto ). 
 As for the reactionary nature of the small producers, that is not brought out in the draft, so that on the whole the relation of the proletariat to the “working and exploited masses” is presented incorrectl y. 
 (For example, the draft reads: “their struggle [the struggleof the working and exploited masses] and, above all, thestruggle of their foremost representative, the proletariat, isbecoming sharper. 
” “The sharpening of the struggle” of the small producers is expressed in anti-Semitism, in Caesarism, in peasant unions against the farm labourers, and even inthe struggle of the socialist Gironde against the Mountain. 
Representation of all the working and exploited masses bythe proletariat should be expressed in the programme in ourarraignment of capitalism for the poverty of the m a s s e s (and not only for the poverty of the working class), for unem-ployment among “ever wider sections of the working popu-lation” [and not of the working class]. 
) 4) The draft constantly slips away from a programme in the strict sense of the word towards a commentary . 
 A pro-gramme should give concise statements , without a single superfluous word, and leave all explanations to commentaries, pamphlets, agitation, etc. 
 Engels was therefore fully justi-fied when he accused the Erfurt Programme of being too long,abounding in too much detail and repetition, so as to tendtowards becoming a commentary. 
 In the draft this shortcoming is still more manifest; there is a dreadful amount of repetition; in any case, the attemptsmade to introduce explanations of the process into the pro-gramme (instead of merely giving a definition of the process)fail to achieve their purpose and render the programme im-possibly prolix. 
 Written in late February-early March 1902 REMARKS ON THE COMMITTEE’S DRAFT PROGRAMME16 TEXT OF THE COMMITTEE’S DRAFT 1. 
 The development of inter-national exchange has establishedsuch close ties among all nationsof the civilised world, that thegreat emancipation movement of the proletariat had to become, and has long become, an inter-national movement.

 For this reason the Russian Social-Democrats regard theirParty as one of the detachmentsof the world army of the prole-tariat, as part of international Social-Democracy, and pursue the same ultimate aim as the Social-Democrats of all other countries. 
 3. 
 This ultimate aim is deter-mined by bourgeois society’snature and course of develop-ment.

 And since, on the otherhand, this same process of tech-nical (machine) progress leads to a relative decrease in the manu-facturers’ need of the workers’physical labour, the demand forlabour-power necessarily lags be-hind its supply, as a consequenceof which the dependence of wage-labour on capital increases and the exploitation of the formerby capital is intensified.

? These words should be de leted as a needless repetitionof the idea already expressedin the preceding proposition. 
 In general, § 5 brings out in particular relief the gen-eral defect of the draft: long periods and an undesirable prolixity of exposition. 
 Incidentally: this results inwhat Engels in his criticismof the Erfurt Draft called “schiefe Nebenbedeutung ”. 
 * For instance, it appears as if the increase in the employ-ment of female and childlabour is due solely to the “conversion” of the independ-ent small producers into proletarians, whereas this isnot so; it also takes placeprior to such “ c o n v e r-s i o n ”. 
 The beginning of § 5 is a superfluous repeti-tion.

 This state of affairs within bourgeois so-Over-production, which causes more or less severe industrial crises, followed by more or less lengthy periods of industrial stag-nation, is an inevitable resultof the growth of the productiveforces, in the absence of planning,which is characteristic of com-modity production, and under the capitalist production relationsinherent in present-day society. 
In their turn crises and periodsof industrial stagnation renderthe position of the independent small producers still more diffi-cult and lead still more rapidlyto the relative and, in some places, even the absolute deterior-ation in the proletarians’ condi-tions. 
 7. 
 Thus, technical progress, which implies an increase inlabour productivity and thegrowth of social wealth, entails,in bourgeois society, an increasein social inequality, a widening of the distance between the prop-ertied and the propertyless, agrowth of insecurity of existence,unemployment and poverty ofevery description. 
Omission. 
 Repetition again!! This is insufficient. 
 Not only do they “render theirposition difficult”, but ruin them outright on a mass scale. 
 The first part of §6 would gain a great deal if it weremade shorter. 
 “Growth of poverty of every description”—this bor-rowing from my draft is not a very apt one. 
 I did notspeak about the g r o w t h of poverty. 
 “Of every de-scription” includes “ absolute ” too. 
 The reference to the poverty of the masses should therefore be worded some-what differently. 
 8. 
 But, as all these contradic-tions, inherent in the capitalistmode of production, grow anddevelop, the working and exploit-ed masses’ discontent with the existing order of things alsogrows, and the struggle of their foremost representative—the pro-letariat—against the championsof this order becomes sharper. 
§8 shows the committee’s stubborn disinclination to ob-serve the precise and unam-biguous c o n d i t i o n i t was set at its very “birth”. 
On the basis of this condi-tion an insertion should have been made (which the com-mittee has done in §10), and, m o r e o v e r , before the insertion the text shoulddeal only with the classstruggle of the proletariata l o n e . 
 This latter demand, clearly expressed in the con-ciliation agreement, was not carried out by the commit-tee, and I consider that Iam within my rights ininsisting that it be carried out. 
 Prior to what is stated at the end of §10, it is i n-c o r r e c t to speak of the discontent of all the workingmasses in general and to call the proletariat their “foremost representative”,since this is true o n l y u n d e r t h e c o n d i -t i o n expressed at the end of §10. 
 The committee pre-sents the conditional as some-thing unconditional. 
 Thehalf-heartedness of thesmall producer and his s e -m i -r e a c t i o n a r y s p i r-i t have not been in any way expressed by the com-mittee: this is quite imper-missible. 
 The result is that At the same time, technical progress, by socialising the pro-cess of labour within the work-shop and concentrating produc-tion,the possibility of finding this small producer (or a part of this section) among the principled “champions of this order” (the same phrasein § 8!!) has been entirelyf o r g o t t e n ! ! And yet this possibility v e r y often becomes a reality before our very eyes. 
 In order to have the right to speak of the movementof the proletariat, its classstruggle and even the class dictatorship , it is necessary first to single out this o n e class, and then only to addsomething about its role asa representative. 
 Otherwisethe result is a lack of coher-ence in the draft; § 8 is not connected in strict logic either with the continua-tion (why not a “dictatorship of the working masses”??),or with the beginning (if all the social antagonisms are aggravated, thatm e a n s that the struggle of the t w o c l a s s e s grows ever sharper, and this issomething the committee has forgotten to point out!!). 
 It does not hang together. 
 The socialisation of la-bour is far from being limit-ed to what takes place with-in the workshop: this passagemust be corrected.

more and more rapidly creates the possibility of the social revo-lution, which constitutes theultimate aim of the entire activ-ity of international Social-Democ-racy, as the conscious spokesmanof the class movement of the proletariat. 
 9. 
 This social revolution will consist in the removal of capi-talist production relations and their substitution by socialist production relations, i. 
e. 
, it will consist in the expropriation ofthe exploiters for the purposeof converting the means of pro-duction and of circulation ofproducts into public property, and in the planned organisation of the social production processso as to satisfy the needs of bothsociety as a whole and its individ-ual members. 
 The achievement of this aim will emancipate all of oppressedhumanity, since it will put an end to all forms of the exploita-tion of one part of society byanother. 
 10. 
 To effect its social revo-lution, the proletariat must winpolitical power ( the class dictator-ship ), which will make it master of the situation and enable it to surmount all obstacles.

 As the most outstanding of all survivals of our serf-owningsystem and the most formidablebulwark of all this barbarism, the tsarist autocracy is wholly in-compatible with political andcivil liberties, which have longbeen in existence in the advancedcountries of capitalist production, as the natural legal complement to that production.

 “Natural legal comple-ment”—a correct thoughtvery badly expressed. 
 Forcapitalism the “naturalness” of liberty is complicated by 1,001 social and historicalfactors, which the word “nat-ural” does not bring out. 
Moreover, it smacks, reeks,of a sort of liberalism. 
 Some-thing should be said to the effect that the “autocracyis inevitably doomed to death by the entire development of capitalism, which imper-atively requires civil and political liberties for the ex-pression of its increasinglycomplex interests”, or some-thing like that, in short,the idea of inevitability should be expressed, with-out giving rise to misunder-On the whole, the more one reads the Committee’s draft, the more one is convinced of the fact that it is, so to say, semi-digested . 
 I take it upon myself to predict that this quality in the draft will bring down upon us a great dealof justified reproaches, if we publish it in such a form. 
 Eve-ryone will see that it is just “pasted together”. 
 If the Lord God has chosen to punish us for our sins by obliging us to come out with a “mongrel” draft, we should at least do everything in our power to reduce the unhappy con-sequences. 
 Therefore, those who are above all guided by a desire to “get through with it as quickly as possible” arequite wrong.

1902—I am writing in the train: I apologise for the scribble. 
 If I have time, I shall write again and more clearly. 
 Written on March 30 (April 12), 1902 ADDITIONAL REMARKS ON THE COMMITTEE ’S DRAFT PROGRAMME Besides my remarks written on the draft itself, I should like to note the following: § 3. 
 “Society (bourgeois) is characterised by the domina-tion of commodity production under capitalist produc-tion relations, i. 
e. 
” ... then follows a description of the basic features of capitalism. 
 The result is an incongruity: the“i. 
e. 
” connects dissimilar, unequal concepts, namely, 1) the modification of commodity production in a form condi-tioned by the domination of capitalist production relations, and 2) the sale of products on the market and the sale oftheir labour-power by the masses of the population. 
 This incongruity, this equating of the b a s i c and most general features of commodity production in general and ofcapitalism in general—and the modifications of commod-ity production on the basis of capitalist production rela-tions (then commodities are no longer exchanged simply ac-cording to value)—clearly shows how poor G. 
 V. 
 Plekha-nov’s formulation is (and yet the committee adopted thisformulation, merely rephrasing it). 
 In a programme thatpresents only the most general and basic features of capital-ism and does not set forth even the theory of surplus-value , we suddenly “nod” to Böhm-Bawerk by calling to mind that“commodity production on the basis of capitalism” is notquite the same as simple commodity production! If so, thenwhy not add to the programme special references to Mikhai-lovsky, Berdayev, and the like? On the one hand, only one very general socialist expression is used to cover even all of Marx’s teachings about the exploitation of labour by capital:“create by their labour the latter’s income” (end of §3)—and on the other hand, note is made of the specific transforma-tion of surplus-value into profit under “commodity produc-tion on the basis of capitalist production relations”. 
 G. 
 V. 
 Plekhanov is quite right when he states that the words “commodity production on the basis of capitalist pro-duction relations” express the fundamental idea of VolumeIII. 
 18 But that is all. 
 There is no point in including this idea in the programme—just as there is no point in de-scribing in the programme the mechanism of realisation, which is the fundamental idea of Volume II, or in describingthe conversion of excess profit into ground rent. 
 In theprogramme it is sufficient to n o t e the exploitation of labour by capital = the creation of surplus-value, whereas to speak of every kind of transformation and modification of the forms of this surplus-value is out of place (and impossible in a few short propositions). 
 ADDITION CONCERNING THE CLASS STRUGGLE I fully share V. 
 Zasulich’s opinion that in our country it is possible to attract a much larger proportion of small producers into the ranks of Social-Democracy and much morerapidly (than in the West), that to achieve this we must doa l l in our power, and that this “wish” should be expressed in the programme “against” the Martynovs and Co. 
 I am in fullagreement with all this. 
 I w e l c o m e the addition that has been made at the end of §10—I emphasise this to avoid any misunderstanding. 
 However, there is no need to go to the other extreme, as V. 
 Zasulich does! A “wish” should not be confused withreality , and with immanently necessary reality at that, to which alone our Prinzipienerklärung * is devoted. 
 It would be desirable to attract a l l the small producers—natu-rally. 
 But we know that they constitute a special class, evenif bound to the proletariat by a thousand ties and interme-diate grades, but nevertheless a special class. 
 In the first place it is essential to draw a line of demar-cation between ourselves and all others, to single out the pro-letariat alone and e x c l u s i v e l y , and only t h e n declare *A declaration of principles. 
— Ed. 
 that the proletariat will emancipate all, that it calls on all, invites all. 
 I agree to this “then”, but I demand that this “in the first place” should come first! Here in Russia the monstrous sufferings of the “working and exploited masses” did not rouse any popular movement until a “handful” of factory workers began the struggle, theclass struggle. 
 And o n l y this “handful” guarantees the con-duct, continuation, and extension of this struggle. 
 It is in Russia, where the critics (Bulgakov) accuse the Social-Dem-ocrats of “peasantophobia”, and the Socialist-Revolution-aries 19 shout of the need for r e p l a c i n g the concept of the class struggle by the concept of “the struggle of a l l the working and exploited” ( Vestnik Russkoi Revolutsii , No. 
 220)—it is in Russia that we must, in the first place , draw a line of demarcation between ourselves and all this riffraff, by means of the most clear-cut definition of the classstruggle alone of the proletariat a l o n e —and only then declare that we call on all , that we shall undertake everything, take everything, extend to include everything. 
 But the committee “extends”, while forgetting to draw a line of demarcation!! And I am accused of being narrow-minded be-cause I demand that this extension be preceded by “demarca-tion”?! But that is trickery, gentlemen!! The struggle inevitably facing us tomorrow against the combined forces of the critics & the more Leftist gentlemen of Russkiye Vedomosti and Russkoye Bogatstvo 21 & the So-cialist-Revolutionaries will most imperatively demand ofus that very demarcation between the class struggle of the proletariat and the “struggle” (is it a struggle?) “of the work-ing and exploited masses”. 
 Phrase-mongering about thesemasses is a trump card in the hands of all the unsicheren Kantonisten , * and the committee is playing into their hands and depriving us of a weapon for the struggle against half-heartedness, in order to emphasise one half! But do not for-get the other half! Written in April 1902 *Unreliable cantonists. 
 In this context—“unreliable allies”.

 AN AMENDMENT TO THE AGRARIAN SECTION OF THE PROGRAMME22 I propose the following amendment to Clause 4 of our agrarian programme: instead of “Establishment of peasant committees (a) for the restitution to the village communes (by expropriation, or, when the land has changed hands , by redemption , etc. 
) of the land”, etc. 
, to state: “Establishment of peasant committees (a) for the restitution to the villagecommunes (by expropriation) of the land which...” etc. 
, i. 
e. 
, t o s c r a p t h e i t a l i c i s e d w o r d s. 
 It seems to me that this amendment should be made for the following considerations: 1. 
 In the agrarian programme we present our “maximum”, our “socio-revolutionary demands” (see my commentary 23). 
 Allowing land redemption, however, runs counter to the socio-revolutionary nature of the entire demand. 
 2. 
 Both the historical tradition of “redemption” (that of 1861)24 and its very content (cf. 
 the well-known phrase: “redemption is nothing but purchase”)25 give it the specific flavour of a mawkishly well-intentioned and bourgeois mea-sure. 
 Our allowing land redemption makes it not impossible for the entire essence of our demand to be discredited (and there will be more than enough vilifiers prepared to do this. 
) * 3. 
 The fear that an “injustice” would be committed by taking away the cut-off lands from people who have paidmoney for them is groundless. 
 We have in any case set tworestrictive conditions for this measure of restituting the *By allowing land redemption, we are degrading the restitution of the cut-off lands from an extraordinary, revolutionary measureto the most petty “reform”. 
 cut-off lands: [(1)—“the lands cut off in 1861”, and (2)— “now used as a means of keeping the peasants in bondage”. 
] It is absolutely right to confiscate property serving the pur-poses of feudal exploitation, and to do so without compen-sation. 
 (Let the purchaser of the cut-off lands then sue theseller—that is no affair of ours. 
) 4. 
 By allowing “redemption”, we are placing the onus of monetary payment on the peasants, who by reason of labour rent were most deeply involved in natural economy: the abruptness of the transition to monetary payments may ruin the peasants in an e s p e c i a l l y rapid way , and this would run counter to the entire spirit of our programme. 
 5. 
 Even if a purchaser of cut-off lands is to be “compen-sated” by way of exception , this should by no means be done at the expense of the peasants, who have the moral and his-torical right to these cut-off lands. 
 “Compensation” can bemade by giving a corresponding plot somewhere in the bor-der regions, etc. 
; but that does not concern us. 
 I ask everyone to vote: F o r = discarding the words about redemption, deleting the words I have indicated.

 Written in April 1902 SIGNS OF BANKRUPTCY Only a year has elapsed since Bogolepov26 was struck by Karpovich’s bullet, which cleared the way for a “newcourse” in the government’s policy towards the universities. 
During this year we have observed successively an unusual surge of social indignation, an unusually gentle note in speeches by our rulers, a regretfully all-too-usual infatua-tion of society with these new speeches, an infatuationwhich has extended to a certain section of the students aswell, and, lastly, following on the fulfilment of Vannovsky’sflorid promises, a new outburst of students’ protests. 
 To those who last spring expected a “new era” and seriously believed that the tsarist drill sergeant would fulfil but amodicum of the hopes harboured by students and society—in short, to the Russian liberals, it should now be clear howmistaken they were in once again giving credence to thegovernment, how little justification there was for halting the movement for reform which in the spring had begun to assume impressive forms, and for allowing themselves to belulled by the sweet strains coming from the governmentsirens. 
 After the promise to reinstate at the universitiesall last year’s victims had been broken, after a series ofnew reactionary measures had flung a challenge to all those who demanded a real reform of the educational system, after a series of fresh and violent reprisals against demonstra-tors who demanded that the fraudulent bankrupt shouldmake good his promises—after all this the governmentof “cordial concern” has published “provisional regula-tions” 27 for student organisations as means of “pacification”, and ... instead of “pacification” is confronted with a general conflagrations of “disorders” again involving all educationalinstitutions. 
 We, revolutionaries, have never for a moment believed that Vannovsky’s promised reforms were meant in earnest. 
 We kept on telling the liberals that the circulars of this “cordial” general and the rescripts of Nicholas Obmanov28 were just another manifestation of the liberal policy theautocracy has become so adept in during forty years of strug-gle against the “internal enemy”, i. 
e. 
, against all progres-sive elements in Russia. 
 We warned the liberals against the “pipe dreams” they began to indulge in following the govern-ment’s very first steps in the spirit of the “new course”. 
We exposed the deliberate falsity of the government’s prom-ises, and warned society: “If your opponent has been stunnedby the first serious assault, keep on showering freshblows at him, redoubling their strength and frequency.... 
” That travesty of the right to organise which the “provisional regulations” are now offering the students was predicted bythe revolutionaries from the very beginning of the talkabout this new gift from the government. 
 We knew whatcould and should have been expected of the autocracy andits miserable attempt at reform. 
 We knew that Vannovsky would “pacify” nobody and nothing, that he would not ful-fil any progressive hopes, and that the “disorders” wouldinevitably recur in one form or another. 
 A year has passed, but society is still marking time. 
 The higher educational institutions that are supposed toexist in any well-ordered state have again stopped func-tioning. 
 Tens of thousands of young people have again had the tenor of their life upset, and society is again facedwith the old question: “What next?” A considerable majority of the students have refused to recognise the “provisional regulations” and the organisa-tions allowed by them. 
 With greater determination than they usually show, the professors are expressing obvious dissatisfaction with this gift of the government. 
 And, in-deed, one does not have to be a revolutionary, one does nothave to be a radical, to recognise that this so-called “reform”not only fails to give the students anything resembling free-dom, but is also worthless as a means of bringing any tran-quillity into university life. 
 Is it not immediately obvious that these “provisional regulations” create in advance a seriesof causes for conflict between the students and the author-ities? Is it not obvious that the introduction of these reg-ulations threatens to turn any students’ meeting, law-fully called for the most peaceful purpose, into a starting-point for fresh “disorders”? Can it be doubted, for example,that by presiding at such meetings the inspectors, who exer-cise police functions, will constantly annoy some, evokeprotest in others, and intimidate and gag yet others? Andis it not clear that Russian students will not allow the character of the discussions at such meetings to be forcibly determined at the “discretion” of the authorities? Yet the “right” of assembly and organisation granted by the government in the absurd form established by the “pro-visional regulations” is the maximum that the autocracy can give the students, if it is to remain an autocracy. 
 Any further step in this direction would amount to a suicidal disturbance of the equilibrium on which the government’srelations with its “subjects” rest. 
 Reconciling themselvesto this maximum that the government can offer, or intensi-fying the political , revolutionary character of their protest— such is the dilemma the students are facing. 
 The major-ity are adopting the latter alternative. 
 More clearly than ever before, a revolutionary note rings in the students’appeals and resolutions. 
 The policy of alternating brutalrepression with Judas kisses is doing its work and revolu-tionising the mass of students. 
 Yes, in one way or another, the students have settled the question confronting them and have declared that they are again prepared to take up the weapon they laid aside(under the influence of the lullabies). 
 But what doessociety, which seems to have dozed off to these treacherouslullabies, intend to do? Why does it persist in maintain-ing silence and in “sympathising on the quiet”? Why is nothing heard of society ’s protests, its active support for the renewed unrest? Is it really prepared to wait “calmly”for the inevitable tragic events by which every studentmovement has been attended hitherto? Does it really intendto confine itself to the wretched role of teller of the num-ber of victims in the struggle and passive observer of its shocking scenes? Why do we not hear the voice of the “fa-thers”, when the “children” have unequivocally declaredtheir intention to offer up new sacrifices on the altar of Russian freedom? Why does our society not support the stu-dents at least in the way the workers have already supported them? After all, the higher educational institutions are attended not by the proletarians’ sons and brothers, andyet the workers in Kiev, Kharkov, and Ekaterinoslav havealready openly declared their sympathy with the protest-ers, despite a number of “precautionary measures” taken bythe police authorities and despite their threats to use armed force against demonstrators. 
 Is it possible that this mani-festation of the revolutionary idealism of the Russian pro-letariat will not influence the behaviour of society, whichis vitally and directly interested in the fate of the stu-dents, and will not urge it to energetic protest? The student “disorders” this year are beginning under fairly favourable portents. 
 They are assured the sympathy of the “crowd”, “the street”. 
 It would be a criminal mis-take on the part of liberal society not to make every effortto completely demoralise the government by giving timely support to the students, and to wrest real concessionsfrom it. 
 The immediate future will show how far our liberal society is capable of such a role. 
 The outcome of the pres-ent student movement largely depends on the answer tothis question. 
 But whatever that outcome may be, one thingis certain: the recurrence of general student disordersafter so brief a lull is a sign of the political bankruptcy of the present system. 
 For three years the universities have been unable to settle down to normal life, studies are con-ducted by fits and starts, one of the cogs of the statemachine is ceasing to function and, after turning uselesslyfor a time, is again coming to a standstill for a longwhile. 
 There can be no doubt that under the present political regime there is no radical cure for this disease. 
 The late Bogolepov sought to save the fatherland by a “hero-ic” method borrowed from the outmoded medicine prescribedby Nicholas I. 
 We know what that led to. 
 It is obviousthat there can be no further progress in this direction. 
 The policy of flirting with the students has now suffered a fiasco. 
 But there is no other way besides violence and flirtation, and each new manifestation of this unquestion-able bankruptcy of the existing regime will undermine its foundations more and more, depriving the government of all prestige in the eyes of the indifferent philistines, and increasing the number of people who realise the need to struggle against it. 
 Yes, the bankruptcy of the autocracy is beyond doubt, and it is hurrying to announce the fact to the world atlarge. 
 Is it not a declaration of bankruptcy that “a stateof emergency” has been proclaimed in a good third of the Empire, and local authorities in all parts of Russia have come out simultaneously with “compulsory decrees” forbid-ding, under pain of severe penalties, acts that Russian lawsdo not allow as it is? By their very nature, all emergencyregulations, which suspend the operation of ordinary laws,are meant to operate for only a limited time and in a limited area. 
 The assumption is that extra-ordinary circum-stances demand the temporary application of emergency mea-sures in definite localities for the purpose of restoringthe equilibrium necessary for the unimpeded operation ofordinary laws. 
 That is the argument used by representativesof the existing regime. 
 Twenty odd years have elapsed since the introduction of the emergency law. 
 Twenty years of its operation in the principal centres of the Empire havenot brought about the “pacification” of the country, orrestored public order. 
 After this powerful remedy has beenin use for twenty years, it appears that the disease of “un-reliability”, which it was devised to combat, has become so widespread and struck such deep roots as to make it necessary to extend it to all towns and factory centres ofany importance! Is this not bankruptcy, openly declared bythe bankrupt himself? Confirmed adherents of the presentorder (undoubtedly such do exist) must be horrified by thefact that the population is gradually becoming inured to this potent medicine, and is ceasing to react to fresh injec-tions of it. 
 The bankruptcy of the government’s economic policy is also coming to light, this time against its will. 
 Theautocracy’s rapacious methods of running the economy haverested on the monstrous exploitation of the peasantry. 
 These methods have taken for granted, as an inevitable conse-quence, recurrent famines among the peasants in one localityor another. 
 At such times the predatory state has attempted to parade before the population in the noble role of consid-erate provider for the very people it has robbed. 
 Begin-ning with 1891, famines have taken an enormous toll of vic-tims, and from 1897 they have followed one another almostwithout interruption. 
 In 1892 Tolstoi bitterly derided thefact that “the parasite is preparing to feed the plant uponwhose juices it thrives”. 
 29 It was, indeed, an absurd idea. 
 Times have changed, and with famine having turned into a normal state of affairs in the countryside, our parasite is not so much taken up with the Utopian idea of feedingthe plundered peasantry, as with declaring that very sameidea an offence against the state. 
 The aim has been achieved—the huge famine of today is taking place in an atmosphereof dead silence that is unusual even in our country. 
 The groans of the starving peasants are not heard; there is no attempt on the part of the public to take the initiative incombating the famine; the newspapers say nothing about thesituation in the villages. 
 An enviable silence, but do notMessrs. 
 the Sipyagins feel that this quiet is highly remi-niscent of the calm before a storm? The state system, which for ages has rested on the pas-sive support of millions of peasants, has reduced the lat-ter to a state in which year in year out they are unable toprovide food for themselves. 
 This social bankruptcy of the monarchy of Messrs. 
 the Obmanovs is no less instructivethan its political bankruptcy. 
 When will the affairs of our fraudulent bankrupt be wound up? Will he manage to carry on much longer, livingfrom day to day, and patching up the holes in his politicaland financial budget with skin taken from the living bodyof the national organism? The greater or lesser period ofgrace that history will allow our bankrupt will depend on many factors; but one of the most important will be the degree of revolutionary activity displayed by those whohave become aware of the existing regime’s complete bank-ruptcy. 
 Its decay is in an advanced stage, and is far aheadof the political mobilisation of the social elements des-tined to be its grave-diggers. 
 This political mobilisa-tion will be carried out most effectively by revolutionary Social-Democracy, which alone will be capable of dealinga mortal blow at the autocracy. 
 The new clash between the students and the government enables and obliges us all to accelerate this mobilisation of all social forces hostile to the autocracy. 
 Months of hostilities in political life are accounted by history as the equivalent of years. 
 Thetimes we live in are indeed times of hostilities. 
 Iskra , No. 
 17, February 15, 1902 Published according to the Iskra text THE ECONOMIC LIFE OF RUSSIA Under this general heading we intend to publish from time to time, as the material accumulates, articles and com-mentaries in which all aspects of Russia’s economic life and economic development will be described from the Marxist point of view. 
 Now that Iskra 30 has begun to appear fort-nightly, the absence of such a section is most keenly felt. 
However, we must call the most earnest attention of allcomrades and sympathisers of our publications to thefact that to conduct this section (at all properly) we need an abundance of material and in this respect our editors find themselves in an exceptionally unfavourable position. 
The contributor to the legal press cannot even imagine themost elementary obstacles that sometimes frustrate the in-tentions and endeavours of the “underground” writer. 
 Do notforget, gentlemen, that we cannot use the Imperial National Library, where tens and hundreds of special publications and local newspapers are at the service of the journalist. 
 Ma-terial for an economics section at all befitting a “news-paper”, i. 
e. 
, material that is at all brisk, topical, and interest-ing to both reader and writer, is scattered in small localnewspapers and in special publications which are mostly either too expensive or are not at all on sale (government, Zemstvo, 31 medical publications, etc. 
). 
 That is why it will be possible to run an economics section tolerably well only if all readers of the illegal newspaper act in accordance with the proverb: “Many a little makes a mickle. 
” Putting asideall false modesty, the Editorial Board of Iskra must admit that in this respect they are very poorly supplied. 
 We are sure that most of our readers are able to read the mostvarious special and local publications, and actually do read them “for themselves”. 
 Only when every such reader asks himself each time he comes across some interesting item: “Is this material available to the editors of our paper? What have I done to acquaint them with this material?”—only then shall we succeed in having all the outstandingdevelopments in Russia’s economic life appraised, not onlyfrom the standpoint of the official, Novoye Vremya , 32 Witte panegyrics, not only for the sake of the traditional liberal-Narodnik plaints, but also from the standpoint of revolutionary Social-Democracy. 
 And now, after this non-liberal plaint, let us get down to the subject. 
 1. 
 THE SAVINGS-BANKS Of late the savings-banks have become one of the most favoured subjects of panegyrics, not only from Witte, butfrom the “critics” as well. 
 The Davids and Hertzes, theChernovs and Bulgakovs, the Prokopoviches and Totomian-tses, in a word, all adherents of the fashionable “criticism of Marxism” (to say nothing of respectable professors, likethe Kablukovs and Karyshevs) chant in various tones andvoices: “Those orthodox devotees talk about the concentra-tion of capital!—Why, the savings-banks alone show usthe decentralisation of capital. 
 They talk of mounting pov-erty! In actual fact, we see an increase in small savings among the people. 
” Let us take the official statistics on the Russian savings-banks for 1899, 33 which someone was kind enough to send us, and examine them more closely. 
 In 1899 there wasa total of 4,781 state savings-banks in Russia, of which 3,718 were located at post-and telegraph-offices and 84 at factories. 
 In five years (from 1895 to 1899) the number ofsavings-banks increased by 1,189, i. 
e. 
, by one-third. 
 Dur-ing the same period the number of depositors increased from1,664,000 to 3,145,000, i. 
e. 
, by almost one and a half mil-lion (by 89 per cent), and the total deposits increased from 330,000,000 rubles to 608,000,000 rubles, i. 
e. 
, by 278,000,000 rubles, or by 84 per cent. 
 And so there has apparently beenan enormous increase in “the people’s savings”? But what strikes the eye in this connection is the fol-lowing circumstance. 
 From literature about the savings-banks it is known that in the eighties and early nineties the total deposits increased most rapidly in the famine years , 1891 and 1892. 
 That is on the one hand. 
 On the other, we know that during this period in general, duringthe eighties and nineties taken together, the increase in“the people’s savings” was accompanied by an astonishingly rapid and drastic process of impoverishment, ruin, and star-vation among the peasantry. 
 To understand how these con-flicting phenomena could go together one need only recallthat the growth of money economy was the principal feature in Russia’s economic life during the period mentioned. 
 Theincrease in savings-bank deposits is by itself not at all indicative of a growth in “the people’s” savings in general, but only of a growth in monetary “savings” (and sometimes even only of their concentration in central institutions). 
Among the peasantry, for example, it is quite possiblethat, with the transition from natural economy to moneyeconomy, there should be an increase in monetary savings with a decrease in the sum-total of “the people’s” savings. 
 The peasant of the old type kept his savings in a stockingwhen these savings were in cash, but most often these sav-ings were made up of grain, fodder, coarse linen, firewood,and like articles “in kind”. 
 The peasant who has been oris being ruined now has savings neither in kind nor in cash, while a negligible minority of peasants who are growing rich are accumulating monetary savings which are beginningto find their way into state savings-banks. 
 Hence, the in-crease in deposits parallel with the spread of famine is quiteunderstandable; what it denotes is not an advancement inthe people’s welfare, but the elimination of the old-type, independent, peasant by the new rural bourgeoisie, i. 
e. 
, the wealthy peasants, who are unable to run their farmswithout permanent farm labourers and day labour-ers. 
 The statistics classifying depositors according to oc-cupation provide interesting oblique confirmation of what has been said above. 
 These data cover nearly three million (2,942,000) accounts, with deposits totalling 545,000,000rubles. 
 The average deposit is shown to be 185 rubles—a sum, as you see, that clearly points to the predominance, among depositors, of “fortunates” who constitute a neg-ligible minority of the Russian people and who have inher-ited or acquired property. 
 The biggest depositors are theclergy : 46,000,000 rubles spread over 137,000 accounts, i. 
e. 
, an average of 333 rubles per account. 
 It seems thatbeing responsible for saving the souls of their flock is notan unprofitable business.... 
 Next in line are the landowners : 9,000,000 rubles on 36,000 accounts, i. 
e. 
, average of 268 rubles; further— merchants : 59,000,000 rubles on 268,000 accounts, i. 
e. 
, an average of 222 rubles; then come offi-cers—with an average of 219 rubles per account, civilservants—averaging 202 rubles. 
 “Agricultural and otherrural occupations” hold only sixth place: 640,000 accounts totalling 126,000,000 rubles, i. 
e. 
, the average account is 197 rubles; then come “employees in private businesses”—withan average of 196 rubles; “miscellaneous occupations”—186 rubles; urban trades—159 rubles; “domestic servants”—143 rubles; factory workers —136 rubles, and last come “pri-vate soldiers”—86 rubles. 
 Thus, factory workers practically come last among depositors (exclusive of private soldiers, who are main-tained by the state)! Even domestic servants have higheraverage savings (143 rubles per account, as against 136rubles) and possess a much larger number of accounts. 
 To beprecise: domestic servants have 333,000 accounts with deposits totalling 48,000,000 rubles, while factory workers have 157,000 accounts with deposits totalling 21,000,000rubles. 
 The proletariat, which creates all the wealth of ouraristocracy and our magnates, is in a worse condition thanservants of the latter! Of the total number of Russian fac-tory workers (not less than two million people) only approximately one-sixth are able to make even the most modest deposits in the savings-banks 34—and this despite the fact that workers’ entire income comes exclusively inmoney, and they often have to support families living inthe villages, so that for the most part their deposits are not“savings” at all in the real sense of the word, but simply sums put aside for the next remittance to their families, etc. 
 Moreover, we say nothing of the fact that the grouplisted under the heading “factory workers” probably includes office clerks, foremen, superintendents, in a word, persons who are not actually factory workers. 
 As to the peasants—if one considers that they are most-ly entered under the heading of “agricultural and otherrural occupations”,—well, their average savings accountis, as we have seen, higher than even that of employeesin private businesses, and considerably exceeds the averagesavings of those coming under the heading of “urban trades” (i. 
e. 
, presumably, shopkeepers, artisans, janitors, etc. 
). 
 Obviously, these 640,000 peasants (out of approximately10,000,000 households, or families) with 126,000,000 rublesin savings-banks belong exclusively to the peasant bour-geoisie . 
 It is only to these peasants, and perhaps to those most closely associated with them, that the data on progress in agriculture, the spread of machinery, improvements in land cultivation, and higher living standards, etc. 
, apply—data brought forward against the socialists by Messrs. 
the Wittes so as to show an “advancement in the people’swelfare”, and by Messrs. 
 the Liberals (and the “Critics”)so as to refute the “Marxist dogma” about the decline and ruin of small-scale farming. 
 These gentlemen do not notice (or pretend not to notice) that the decline of small-scaleproduction is expressed precisely in the fact that a negli-gible number of people who grow rich through the ruin ofthe masses come from the ranks of the small producers. 
 Of still greater interest are data classifying the total number of depositors according to the size of their depos-its. 
 In round figures, this classification is as follows: ofthree million depositors, one million possess accountsnot exceedin g 25 rubles . 
 Their deposits total 7,000,000 ru-bles (out of 545,000,000 rubles, i. 
e. 
, only 12 kopeks of every10 rubles of the aggregate deposits!). 
 The average account is 7 rubles . 
 That is to say, the really small depositors, who constitute one-third of the total number, possess only /FL0150 of the aggregate sum. 
 Further, depositors with accounts of between 25 and 100 rubles constitute one-fifth of the totalnumber (600,000) and own a total of 36,000,000 rubles, theaverage account being 55 rubles. 
 If we combine these two groups, we see that over 50 per cent of all depositors (1,600,000 out of 3,000,000) own only 42,000,000 rubles, or /FL0126, of the grand total of 545,000,000 rubles. 
 Of the remaining well-to-do depositors one million have accounts ranging from 100 to 500 rubles, with deposits totalling 209,000,000 rubles, the average account being 223 rubles. 
 Four hundred thousand depositors have accounts exceeding 500 rubleseach, with deposits totalling 293,000,000 rubles, an averageof 762 rubles. 
 Consequently, these evidently well-to-dopeople, who form less than 7 of the total number of depos-itors, possess more than half (54 per cent) of the total capital. 
 Hence, the concentration of capital in present-day society, the dispossession of the masses, makes itself feltwith great force even in an institution especially intendedfor the “younger brother”, the poorer section of the popula-tion, since deposits are limited by law to 1,000 rubles. 
 And let us note that this concentration of property, which is typical of any capitalist society, is still higher in theadvanced countries, despite the greater “democratisation” oftheir savings-banks. 
 In France, for instance, as of December31, 1899, there were 10,500,000 savings-bank accounts withdeposits totalling 4,337,000,000 francs (a franc is slightly less than 40 kopeks). 
 That makes an average of 412 francs per account, or about 160 rubles, i. 
e. 
, less than the average deposit in Russian savings-banks. 
 The number of smalldepositors in France is also comparatively larger thanin Russia: approximately one-third of depositors (3 3 million) have accounts ranging up to 20 francs (8 rubles), the average deposit being 13 francs (5 rubles). 
 Altogeth-er these depositors possess only 35,000,000 francs out ofa total of 4,337,000,000, i. 
e. 
, /FL0146. 
 Depositors with accounts of up to 100 francs constitute a little over 50 percent of the total number (5,300,000), but possess a totalof only 143,000,000 francs, i. 
e. 
, /FL0139 of the aggregate de-posits. 
 On the other hand, depositors with accounts of 1,000 francs and over (400 rubles and over), while constitutingless than one-fifth (18. 
5 per cent) of the total number of depositors, have concentrated in their hands over two-thirds (68. 
7 per cent) of all deposits, viz. 
, 2,979,000,000 francsout of a total of 4,337,000,000 francs. 
 Thus, the reader now has before him a certain amount of information for an appraisal of our “critics’” argu-ments. 
 One and the same fact—the enormous increase in savings-bank deposits, and in particular the increase in the number of small depositors—is interpreted in differ-ent ways. 
 The “critics of Marxism” say: the people’s wel-fare is growing and decentralisation of capital is increas-ing. 
 The socialists say: what is taking place is the conver-sion of savings “in kind” into monetary savings, and thenumber of well-to-do peasants, who are turning bourgeoisand converting their savings into capital, is increasing. 
 An incomparably more rapid growth is to be seen in the number of peasants being driven into the ranks of the proletariat,which lives by the sale of its labour-power and puts (at leasttemporarily) part of its meagre income into the savings-banks. 
 The large number of small depositors merely goesto show how numerous are the poor in capitalist society, since the share of these small depositors in the aggregate deposits is negligible. 
 The question arises: in what way do the “critics” differ from the most ordinary bourgeois? Let us go further, and see how the capital of the savings-banks is used and for what purposes. 
 In Russia this cap-ital serves primarily to strengthen the might of the mili-tarist and bourgeois-police state. 
 The tsarist government(as we have already pointed out in a leading article in No. 
 15of Iskra *) disposes of this capital just as arbitrarily as it does of all other public property it lays hands on. 
 It quitecalmly “borrows” hundreds of millions of this capital for financing its Chinese expeditions, for hand-outs to capital-ists and landowners, for re-equipping the army, enlargingthe navy, etc. 
 Thus, in 1899, for example, 613,000,000rubles out of aggregate savings-bank deposits of 679,000,000rubles were invested in securities, viz. 
, 230,000,000 rublesin state loans , 215,000,000 rubles in mortgages held by the Land Banks, and 168,000,000 rubles in railway loans. 
 The Treasury is doing some very profitable “business”: first, it covers all expenses incurred by the savings-banksand gets a net profit (hitherto credited to the reserve fundof the savings-banks); secondly, it compels the depositors to cover the deficits in our state economy (compels them to *See present edition, Vol. 
 5, “The Budget”. 
— Ed. 
 /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR loan money to the Treasury). 
 From 1894 to 1899, deposits in savings-banks totalled an average of 250,000,000 rubles per annum, while withdrawals amounted to 200,000,000 rubles. 
 Consequently, that leaves fifty million rubles an-nually that can be used for loans to patch up holes in theTreasury’s money-bags, into which thieving fingers aredipped by all but the laziest. 
 Why fear deficits due tosquandering money on wars and on hand-outs to hangers-on at Court, to landlords and manufacturers when it is always possible to obtain sizable sums from the “people’s savings”! We shall add parenthetically that one of the reasons the Treasury is conducting such profitable business isbecause it is steadily lowering the rate of interest paidon monetary deposits, which is lower than the interest on securities. 
 For example, in 1894 the interest paid on mon-etary deposits was 4. 
12 per cent, and on securities—4. 
34per cent; in 1899 it was 3. 
92 per cent and 4. 
02 per cent,respectively. 
 As is well known, reduction of interest isa feature common to all capitalist countries and it bringsout most clearly and graphically the growth of big capital and large-scale production at the expense of small-scale production , because in the final analysis the rate of in-terest is determined by the ratio between aggregate prof-its and the aggregate capital invested in production. 
 Norcan we ignore the fact that the Treasury is constantly inten-sifying its exploitation of postal and telegraph employees: at first they had only the mails to look after; then the tele-graph was added; now they have been burdened also with thejob of receiving and paying out savings deposits (it shouldbe remembered that 3,718 out of the 4,781 savings-banksare at post-and telegraph-offices). 
 A terrific increase in theintensity of labour and a longer working day—that is what this means to the mass of postal and telegraph employ-ees. 
 As to their salaries, the Treasury scrimps on them likethe most close-fisted kulak: the lowest grade of employees,those who have just entered service, are paid literally star-vation rates; then comes an endlessly graded succession of twenty-five-kopek and fifty-kopek rises, and the prospect of a niggardly pension after forty to fifty years of drudgery is intended to increase even more the bondage of this veritable“proletariat of officialdom”. 
 But let us return to the way savings-bank capital is used. 
 We have seen that (by order of the Russian Govern-ment) the banks invest 215,000,000 rubles in mortgages held by the Land Banks and 168,000,000 rubles in rail-way loans. 
 This fact has provided food for still anotherand of late extremely widespread display of bourgeois ...I meant to say “critical” wisdom. 
 In essence, the Bern-steins, the Hertzes, the Chernovs, the Bulgakovs, and their like tell us, this fact means that the small depositors in the savings-banks are becoming railway owners and land mortgage holders . 
 It is a fact, they argue, that even such purely capitalist and colossal enterprises as the railwaysand banks are becoming more and more decentralised,are being divided up, and are passing into the hands of petty proprietors, who acquire them by purchasing shares, bonds, mortgages, etc. 
; it is a fact that the wealthy, the own-ers of property are growing in number—yet those narrow-minded Marxists are fussing about with the antiquatedtheory of concentration and the theory of impoverishment. 
If, for instance, the Russian factory workers have 157,000 accounts at savings-banks with aggregate deposits amount-ing to 21,000,000 rubles, about 5,000,000 rubles of thissum is invested in railway loans, and about 8,000,000 ru-bles in Land Bank mortgages. 
 That means that Russian fac-tory workers own 5,000,000 rubles’ worth of railwaysand are landowners worth 8,000,000 rubles. 
 Now go and talk of a proletariat! Hence, the workers are exploiting the landowners, since, in the form of interest on mortgages,they receive a modicum of rent, i. 
e. 
, a small portion ofthe surplus-value. 
 Yes, this precisely is the line of reasoning adopted by the latest critics of Marxism.... 
 And—here is something that will surprise you—I am prepared to agree with the widespread opinion that we should welcome this “criti-cism”, since it has brought a stir into a theory which wasalleged to be stagnant; I am prepared to agree to that onthe following condition. 
 There was a time when the Frenchsocialists whetted their skill as propagandists and agita-tors by analysing the sophisms of Bastiat, while the German socialists followed suit by unravelling the sophisms of Schul-ze-Delitzsch 35; as for us, Russians, it has thus far fallen to our lot to deal only with the company of “critics”. 
 And so, I am prepared to shout, “Long live criticism!”— on condi-tion that, in our propaganda and agitation among the masses, we, socialists, engage as widely as possible in an anal-ysis of all the bourgeois sophisms of fashionable “criticism”. 
If you agree to this condition we can call it a bargain!Incidentally, our bourgeoisie are more and more maintaininga discreet silence; for they prefer the protection of the tsarist archangels * to that of the bourgeois theoreticians, and it will be very convenient for us to accept the “critics”as the “devil’s advocates”. 
 Through the savings-banks ever larger numbers of workers and small producers are taking a share in big enterprises. 
This is undoubtedly a fact. 
 What this fact shows, how-ever, is not an increase in the number of property-owners, but 1) the growing socialisation of labour in capitalist society,and 2) the growing subordination of small-scale productionto large-scale production. 
 Take the small Russian deposit-or. 
 Over 50 per cent of such depositors, as we have seen,have accounts of up to 100 rubles, to wit 1,618,000 depositors with savings totalling 42,000,000 rubles, i. 
e. 
, an average of 26 rubles per depositor. 
 Thus, this depositor “owns”about 6 rubles’ worth of railways and about 9 rubles’ worthof “landed property”. 
 Does this make him wealthy or a “pro-prietor”? No, he remains a proletarian, who is forced to sellhis labour-power, i. 
e. 
, to become a slave of those who own the means of production. 
 As for his “share” in “railway and banking” business, it merely shows that capitalism is in-creasingly linking together individual members of societyand individual classes. 
 The interdependence of individualproducers was infinitesimal in patriarchal economy; itis now constantly increasing. 
 Labour is becoming more and more social, and enterprises less and less “private”, al-though they still remain almost entirely in private hands. 
 His participation in a big enterprise undoubtedly weaves the small depositor into the pattern of that enterprise. 
 Who benefits from this link? Big capital does, whichextends its transactions by paying the small depositor no *An appellation given in tsarist Russia to members of the secret police. 
— Ed. 
 more (and often less) than it pays any other lender, and by being the more independent of the small depositors, the smaller and the more scattered the latter are. 
 We have seen that the share of the small depositors is extremely smalleven in the savings-bank capital. 
 How insignificant, then,must it be in the capital of the railway and banking mag-nates. 
 By giving his mite to these magnates, the small depos-itor enters into a new dependence on big capital. 
 He cannot even think of having any say in the use of this big capital; his “profit” is ridiculously small (26 rubles at 4 per cent = 1 ruble a year!). 
 Yet in the event of a failure he loses evenhis miserable mite. 
 What the abundance of these smalldepositors signifies is not the decentralisation of big capitalbut the strengthening of the power of big capital, which is able to dispose of even the smallest mites in the “people’s” savings. 
 His share in big enterprises does not make the smalldepositor more independent; on the contrary, he becomesmore dependent on the big proprietor. 
 What follows from the increase in the number of small depositors is not the reassuring philistine deduction about an increase in the number of wealthy people, but the rev-olutionary conclusion of the growing dependence of thesmall depositors on the big, of the mounting contradictionbetween the increasingly socialised nature of the enter-prises and the preservation of private ownership of themeans of production. 
 The more the savings-banks develop, the more interested do the small depositors become in the socialist victory of the proletariat, which alone will makethem real, and not fictitious, “sharers” in and administra-tors of social wealth.

P. 
 COMMITTEES36 March 5, 1902. 
 Comrades! Only the day before yesterday we received no-tice of the meeting to be called for March 21, togetherwith the entirely unexpected information that the orig-inal plan to hold a conference had been superseded by aplan to convene a Party congress. 
 We do not know who isresponsible for this sudden and unmotivated change. 
 On our part, we consider it most unfortunate. 
 We protest against such rapid changes in decisions on highly complexand important Party measures, and strongly recommenda return to the original plan for a conference. 
 To be convinced of the necessity for this, it is enough, in our opinion, to give more careful consideration to the agenda ( Tagesordnung ) of the congress, which was likewise communicated to us only the day before yesterday; more-over, we do not know whether this is only a draft Tagesord-nung , and whether this agenda has been proposed by one or by several organisations. 
 The agenda provides for ninequestions to be discussed by the congress in the following order (I am giving a brief summary of the points): A) the economic struggle; B) the political struggle; C) politicalagitation; D) May Day; E) the attitude towards opposi-tion elements; F) the attitude towards revolutionary groupsunaffiliated to the Party; G) organisation of the Party;H) the Central Organ, and I) representatives and Party organisations abroad. 
 First, in its architecture and in the wording of the indi-vidual questions this agenda produces an irresistible impression of “economism”. 
37 We do not of course think that the organisation proposing this agenda would entertain “economist” views to this day (although to some extent this is not altogether impossible), but we ask the comradesto remember that it is also necessary to take into accountboth the opinion held by international revolutionarySocial-Democracy, and those survivals of “economism” whichare still widespread in our country. 
 Just imagine: the ad-vanced party of political struggle calls a congress at a time when all revolutionary and opposition forces in thecountry, which have begun a direct attack on the autocra-cy, are straining every effort—and all of a sudden we laychief stress on the “economic struggle”, with “politics” fol-lowing only in the wake!! Is this not a copy of the tradition-al error of our “economists”, who claim that political agita-tion ( resp . 
 struggle) should come after the economic? Is it possible to imagine that it would occur to any EuropeanSocial-Democratic Party, during a revolutionary period, toplace the question of the trade-union movement before allother questions? Or take this separation of the question of political agitation from the question of the political struggle! Does it not smack of the usual fallacy whichcontraposes the political struggle to political agitationas something fundamentally different, something belongingto a different stage? Or, lastly, how is one to explain thefact that demonstrations figure in the agenda primarily as a means of the economic struggle!?? After all, we must not forget that at the present time a number o f elements hostile to Social-Democracy are levelling againstall Social-Democracy the accusation of “economism”: theseaccusations are being made by Nakanune , 38 by Vestnik Russkoi Revolutsii , by Svoboda ,*39 and even (even!) by Russkoye Bogatstvo . 
 We must not forget that whatever resolutions the conference may adopt, the agenda itselfwill remain a historical document by which the levelof our entire Party’s political development will bejudged. 
 Secondly, it is astonishing that the agenda raises (a few days before the congress 1) questions that should be *See pp. 
 283-84 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 discussed only after thorough preparations, only when it is possible to adopt really definite and comprehensible decisions on them—otherwise it is better not to discuss them at all for the time being. 
 For example, points E andF: the attitude towards opposition and other revolutionarytrends. 
 These questions must be discussed in advance,from all angles, reports drawn up on them, and differencesin existing shades made clear—only then can we adopt de-cisions that would actually offer something new, that would serve as a real guide for the whole Party, and not merely repeat some traditional “generalisation”. 
 In pointof fact, just consider: can we in a few days prepare a compre-hensive and well-grounded decision that would take intoconsideration all the practical requirements of the move-ment on the questions of the attitude towards the “revo-lutionary-socialist Svoboda group” or towards the new-born “Socialist-Revolutionary Party”? This apart from the strangeimpression, to say the least, that will be produced on every-one by the fact that revolutionary groups unaffiliated tothe Party are mentioned, while nothing is said on so impor-tant a question as the attitude towards the Bund, 40 or a revision of the clauses dealing with the latter, in the reso-lutions of the First Congress of the Party. 
 Thirdly—and most important—there is an unpardonable omission in the agenda: not a word is said of the stand taken by present-day Russian revolutionary Social-Democ-racy on matters of principle , or of its Party programme . 
 At a time when the whole world is clamouring about the“crisis of Marxism”, and all Russian liberal publicists areclamouring even about its collapse and disappearance , when the question of the “two trends in Russian Social-Democracy”has not only been placed on the order of the day, but has even found its way into various lecture programmes, into the programmes for propagandists’ talks and self-educationgroups—at a time like this it is quite impossible to passover these questions in silence. 
 We, comrades, are beingridiculed by our opponents, who already say even in print (see Nadezhdin, “The Eve of the Revolution”) that we have grown accustomed to “reporting that all’s well”!... In our opinion, all the above-mentioned shortcomings in the agenda prove convincingly how irrational is the plan to convert into a congress a conference that has al-ready been summoned. 
 We understand, of course, how keenly everyone feels the fact that there has been no Party con-gress since 1898, how tempting the idea is of using theefforts spent in organising the conference so as to put anend to this existence of a “party without party institu-tions”. 
 But it would be a very great mistake to let these prac-tical considerations make us forget that from a congress of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party everyone now expects decisions which would be on a level with all the rev-olutionary tasks of the present time; that if we fail torise to the occasion now , at this truly critical moment, we may bury all Social-Democracy’s hopes to gain the hege-mony in the political struggle; that it is better not to be-grudge an expense of a few thousand rubles and several months of preparatory organisational work, and to use the presentconference so as to prepare for the summer a congress thatwill really be a general Party congress capable of finally settling all immediate problems both in the sphere of the-ory (the theoretical programme) and in the sphere of the po-litical struggle. 
 Look at the Socialist-Revolutionaries, who are more and more skilfully taking advantage of our shortcomingsand gaining ground to the detriment of Social-Democracy. 
They have only just formed a “party”, founded a theoretical organ, and decided to launch a political monthly newspaper. 
 What will be said of the Social-Democrats if after this event they fail to achieve at their congress results at least such as these ? Are we not running the risk of creating the impres-sion that when it comes to a clear-cut programme and revo-lutionary organisation the Social-Democrats are not aheadof this “party”, which is known to be gathering around it-self all sorts of indeterminate, undetermined, and even undeterminable elements? In view of all this we believe that the present congress of committee representatives should not be declared the Sec-ond regular Congress of the Russian Social-DemocraticLabour Party, but an unofficial conference . 
 This con-ference’s main and immediate task should be to organise and prepare for next summer a real general Party con-gress capable of endorsing the Party programme, making final arrangements for publication of a political weekly organ of the Party, and in general bringing about the complete and actual unification of all committees and even of all groups (in print-shops,41 etc. 
) of Social-Democrats on the basis of steadfastness of principle, loyalty to the principles ofrevolutionary Social-Democracy, and genuinely militantpreparedness for offensive political action. 
 Proceeding from this basic idea, we take the liberty of submitting to the comrades for their consideration the fol-lowing Tagesordnung for our conference: 1. 
Statement of principles . 
 In the resolution on this question an emphatic stand should be taken against thosedeplorable attempts to restrict our theory and our tasks,which were but recently quite widespread. 
 By vigorously rejecting any such restrictions the Party conference will make an important contribution to the unification of allSocial-Democrats on matters of principle and will re-establish the shaken prestige of revolutionary Marxism. 
Some comrades may perhaps express fear that discussionon the statement of principles will take up a great deal of time and divert attention from practical questions. 
 We do not in the least share these apprehensions, for we believethat the extensive debates in the illegal press have clearedup the question so well that we shall reach an agreementon the principles of revolutionary Social-Democracy withgreat speed and ease. 
 On the other hand, it is utterly im-possible to do without a statement of principles. 
 Moreover, the removal of this question from the con-ference’s Tagesordnung would in any case fail in its pur-pose since the very same question would inevitably comeup, only in more disjointed form, in the discussion of theresolutions on the economic struggle, the political struggle, etc. 
 For this reason it would be far more expedient to first finish with this matter, refrain from splitting up our reso-lutions on political agitation, strikes, and so on, and giveone connected exposition of the view on our main tasks. 
 On our part, we will endeavour to prepare a draft of this resolution and append it to this report (if time permits). 
 2. 
The Second regular Congress of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party . 
 Here we have in view the prelim-inary (and, of course, to a certain extent tentative) decision on the question of the date of the congress (sum-mer, or not later than autumn, since it is desirable to end it before the next “season”), the place (in connection with which the conditions of secrecy must be carefully consid-ered), the funds required for its arrangement ( Iskra , on its part, would be prepared to immediately contribute 500rubles for this purpose, from a certain special donation ithas received; we would possibly be able soon to find anoth-er such sum or even more. 
 We should discuss how many thousand rubles it will approximately cost, and practicalways of raising the rest); lastly, the general principles ofrepresentation and the fullest possible representation (i. 
e. 
, soas to ensure representation of definite pre-selected committeesand certain groups, and possibly also of study circles of Rus-sian Social-Democrats, to say nothing of the comparatively easy task of securing representatives from the two Social-Democratic organisations abroad; a procedure should alsobe adopted for discussing the question of inviting to thecongress such organisations that may be founded in the in-terim between conference and congress, etc. 
, etc. 
). 
 3. 
Election of an Organising Committee . 
 Generally speak-ing, the task of this O. 
C. 
 should be to implement con-ference decisions, make preparations for and arrange thecongress, set a final date and place for the latter, attendto its practical organisation, arrange such matters as thetransport of literature, and establish Party print-shops in Russia (with the aid of Iskra , two local print-shop groups sympathising with our publications have been formedin Russia; they have succeeded in publishing in their twoprint-shops Nos. 
 10 and 11 of Iskra , the pamphlets. 
 What Next? , The Tenth Anniversary of the Morozov Strike , The Speech by Pyotr Alexelyev , The Indictment in the Obukhov Case , and many others, as well as a number of leaflets. 
 We hope that representatives from these local groups willbe able to participate in the work of the conference andthat they will assist in every way in the accomplishmentof the general Party tasks); further, it should give assis-tance to various local organisations, labour unions, stu-dents’ organisations, and so on and so forth. 
 With the support of all organisations, this O. 
 C. 
 could, in the spaceof three or four months, fully prepare the ground for the formation of a real Central Committee, capable de facto of directing the entire political struggle of our Party. 
 In view of the complexity and variety of the O. 
C. 
’s tasks, it should, in our opinion, consist of a fairly large num-ber of members (5-7), who should be directed to elect abureau, distribute functions among themselves, and holdseveral meetings prior to the congress. 
 4. 
Election of a committee for preparing a draft Party programme . 
 As the editors of Iskra (including the Eman-cipation of Labour group 42) have already been working on this difficult job for a long time, we venture to proposethe following plan to the comrades. 
 We have already com-pleted the entire draft of the practical section of the pro-gramme, including the draft agrarian programme, and, besides, two variants for the theoretical part of the programme have been prepared. 
 Our representative will acquaint theconference with these drafts, should this be found necessaryand if nothing comes up to prevent him from doing so. 
 Fromthese two variants, we are at present drawing up a singlegeneral draft, but of course we should not like to make it public in its rough form, i. 
e. 
, before the work is com-pleted. 
 Should the conference elect several persons to col-laborate with our Editorial Board in the preparation ofthe programme, that might perhaps be the most practicalsolution of the question. 
 For our part, we can in any case give the comrades an immediate formal undertaking to submit within a few weeks the final draft of the Party programme, which we intendedto publish in advance in Iskra , so as to enable all comrades to get acquainted with it, and to obtain their com-ments. 
 5. 
The Central Organ . 
 In view of the tremendous dif-ficulties involved in launching a periodical which would appear regularly and be adequately provided with literaryand technical facilities, the conference will most likelyfollow the example of the First Congress of the Party andchoose an existing publication. 
 Whether the question issettled in this way, or whether it is decided to launch an entirely new periodical, it will in any case be necessary to instruct a special committee, or better still the sameOrganising Committee, to undertake the preparatory work and to discuss the matter from all angles together with the existing or newly-elected editorial board. 
 It would be essential, in our opinion, to draw the Eman-cipation of Labour group into this discussion, for withoutits co-operation and guidance we cannot imagine the properorganisation of a political organ that would be consistentin principle and would in general meet all the requirementsof the movement. 
 Inasmuch as attempts to establish a fortnightly period-ical have already been made before the conference, the Par-ty should make it its immediate task to establish a weekly newspaper : this would be fully possible given really joint work on such a paper by all Russian Social-Democrats. 
 6. 
Preparation of the agenda for the Party congress and reports on that agenda . 
 The conference should draw up part of this agenda itself, and entrust part of it to the Or-ganising Committee; it should without fail appoint ( resp . 
 find) reporters on each question. 
 Only by appointing re-porters in advance is it possible to ensure a truly compre-hensive discussion of the various questions and correct decisions on them at the congress (some of the reports could be printed beforehand in full or in part, and discussedin the press; for instance, we hope to publish soon an almostcompleted treatise on the agrarian programme of RussianSocial-Democracy, etc. 
, written by a member of the Edi-torial Board, * etc. 
). 
 7. 
Current practical questions of the movement —for example, a) discussion and endorsement of a May Dayleaflet ( resp . 
 discussion of drafts submitted by Iskra and other organisations). 
 b) The May Day demonstration—the time and methods of its organisation. 
 c) Instructions to the Organising Committee to assist in organising boycotts, demonstrations, etc. 
, and at thesame time gradually to prepare the minds of Party members,and likewise the forces and means of the Party, for a gen-eral uprising of the people. 
 d) Various financial questions relating to the mainten-ance of the Organising Committee, etc.

 Concluding our report on the tasks and Tagesordnung o f our congress, we shall only remark that it is absolutely impossible for us to draw up a detailed report on the work of Iskra because we are extremely pressed for time. 
 We are therefore compelled to limit ourselves to the followingbrief outline. 
 (N. 
B. 
) ROUGH OUTLINE OF RESOLUTION 1. 
 The conference categorically rejects each and every attempt to inject opportunism into the revolutionary classmovement of the proletariat—attempts which have foundexpression in the so-called “criticism of Marxism”, Bern-steinism, 43 and “economism”. 
 At a time when the bourgeoi-sie of all countries is rejoicing over the so widely publicised“crisis in socialism”, the conference declares, in the nameof the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, its solidar-ity with the revolutionary international Social-Democraticmovement, and expresses its firm conviction that Social-Democracy will emerge from this crisis stronger than ever and prepared for a relentless struggle for the achievementof its great ideals. 
 2. 
 The conference declares its solidarity with the Man-ifesto of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party 44 and confirms that it considers the overthrow of the autoc-racy the immediate political task of the Party. 
 The con-ference declares that in its work for the accomplishmentof this immediate task as well as of its ultimate aimSocial-Democracy lays chief stress on all-round and nation-wide political agitation which calls on the proletariatto fight against all manifestations of economic, political, national, and social oppression, whatever section of the population this oppression is directed against. 
 The con-ference declares that the Party will support every revolu-tionary and progressive opposition movement directed againstthe existing political and social system. 
 The conferenceparticularly recommends, as practical methods of struggle, the organisation of boycotts, manifestations at theatres, etc. 
, as well as organised mass demonstrations. 
 The con-ference advises all Party committees and groups to devote due attention to the need for preparatory measures for a nation-wide armed uprising against the tsarist autocracy. 
 3. 
 The conference declares that Russian Social-Democ-racy will continue as heretofore to guide the economicstruggle of the proletariat, will strive to extend and deep-en it, to strengthen its ideological and organisationalbonds with the Social-Democratic labour movement, and willendeavour to take advantage of every manifestation of this struggle so as to develop the political consciousness of the proletariat and draw the latter into the political struggle. 
The conference declares that there is no need what-ever to conduct agitation from the very outset on an eco-nomic basis alone, or to consider economic agitation ingeneral to be the most widely applicable means of drawing the masses into the political struggle.

 L e n i n I There is hardly any need to prove at length that an “ag-rarian programme” is essential to the Russian Social-Dem-ocratic Party. 
 By an agrarian programme we mean a def-inition of the guiding principles of Social-Democratic policy on the agrarian question, i. 
e. 
, policy in relation to agriculture and the various classes, sections, and groupsof the rural population. 
 Naturally, in a “peasant” countrylike Russia the agrarian programme of the socialists ischiefly, if not exclusively, a “peasant programme”, a pro-gramme defining their attitude towards the peasant question. 
 Big landowners, agricultural wage-workers, and “peasants”—these are the three main components of the ru-ral population in any capitalist country, Russia included. 
In the same measure as the attitude of the Social-Democratsto the first two of these three components (the landownersand the labourers) is definite and self-evident, even the very concept of the “peasantry” is indefinite, and all the more indefinite is our policy with regard to the fundamentalproblems of its life and evolution. 
 If in the West the cruxof the Social-Democrats’ agrarian programme is preciselythe “peasant question”, how much more so must that bethe case in Russia. 
 It is all the more necessary for us, Rus-sian Social-Democrats, to have the most unambiguous def-inition of our policy in the peasant question because inRussia our movement is still quite new and because the wholeof old Russian socialism was, in the final analysis, a “peas-ant” socialism. 
 True, the mass of Russian “radicals”, whoimagine themselves the custodian of the heritage left by our Narodnik socialists of all shades, have practically noth-ing socialistic left in them. 
 But all of them are all themore eager to bring into the forefront their differences with us on the “peasant” question, the more it pleases them to tone down the fact that the “labour” question has come into the foreground of the social and political life of Russia, and the fact that they have no stable principles whatever inthis question, while in essence nine-tenths of them are themost ordinary bourgeois social-reformers in this matter. 
Lastly, the numerous “critics of Marxism”, who in the lat-ter respect have almost entirely merged with the Russian radicals (or liberals?), are also endeavouring to lay specific emphasis on the peasant question, on which “orthodox Marx-ism” is allegedly most completely put to shame by the“latest works” of the Bernsteins, Bulgakovs, Davids,Hertzes and even ... the Chernovs! Further, in addition to the theoretical uncertainties and the war of “progressive” trends, the purely practical requirements of the movement itself have of late lentspecial urgency to the task of propaganda and agitationin the countryside. 
 However, this work cannot be conduct-ed at all seriously and on a large scale without a programmeconsistent in principle and politically expedient. 
 Since the very day of their appearance as an independent trend, Russian Social-Democrats have realised the full impor-tance of the “peasant question”. 
 Let us recall that thedraft programme of the Russian Social-Democrats pre-pared by the Emancipation of Labour group and publishedin 1885 contains a demand for a “radical revision of ag-rarian relationships (the terms of redemption and allot-ment of land to the peasants)”. 
 * In the pamphlet entitled The Tasks of the Socialists in the Fight Against the Famine in Russia (1892), G. 
 V. 
 Plekhanov also spoke of the So-cial-Democratic policy on the peasant question. 
 It is therefore quite natural that in one of its first issues (April 1901, No. 
 3) Iskra also published a rough outline of an agrarian programme, defining its attitude towardsthe principles of the Russian Social-Democrats’ agrarianpolicy, in an article entitled “The Workers’ Party and thePeasantry”.

 First page of Lenin’s manuscript, “The Agrarian Programme of Russian Social-Democracy”, 1902 Reduced the editors, have received a number of comments and letters. 
 The clause on the restitution of the cut-off lands evoked most objections, and we were planning to launch a discus-sion on the matter in the columns of Zarya , when No. 
 10 of Rabocheye Dyelo appeared with an article by Martynov which, among other things, dealt with the Iskra agrarian programme. 
 Since Rabocheye Dyelo has voiced many of the current objections, we hope that our correspondents will not resent our confining ourselves for the time being to a reply to Martynov alone. 
 I stress for the time being because of the following cir-cumstances. 
 The Iskra article was written by one of the editors, and although the other members of the Edito-rial Board agreed with the author on the general presenta-tion of the question, there could, of course, have been differences of opinion on particulars and specific points. 
In the meantime, our entire Editorial Board (i. 
e. 
, includ-ing the Emancipation of Labour group) was occupied withthe preparation of a collective draft programme for ourParty. 
 This work was protracted (partly as a result of var-ious Party affairs and certain circumstances of our ille-gal work, and partly because of the necessity for a spe-cial congress to discuss the programme from all angles),and was completed only quite recently. 
 As long as theclause on the restitution of the cut-off lands remainedmy personal opinion, I made no haste to defend it, since the general presentation of the question of our agrarian policy was far more important to me than this particularclause, which could still be rejected or substantially mod-ified in our general draft. 
 I shall now be defending thisgeneral draft. 
 As to the “friendly reader” who took thetrouble of communicating to us his criticism of our agrar-ian programme, we ask him now to undertake the critic-ism of our general draft. 
 II We shall quote the “agrarian” section of this draft pro-gramme in full. 
 “With a view to eradicating the remnants of the old serf-owning system and for the purpose of facilitating the free development of the class struggle in the countryside, the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party will work for: “1) abolition of land redemption and quit-rent pay-ments, as well as of all services now imposed on the peas-antry as a taxable social-estate; “2) annulment of collective liability and of all laws restricting the peasant in the free disposal of his land; “3) restitution to the people of all sums taken from them in the form of land redemption and quit-rent payments;confiscation for this purpose of monasterial property andof the royal demesnes, and imposition of a special land taxon members of the big landed nobility who received land redemption loans, the revenue thus obtained to be cred-ited to a special public fund for the cultural and charitableneeds of the village communes; “4) establishment of peasant committees “a) for the restitution to the village communes (by ex-propriation, or, when the land has changed hands, by redemption, etc. 
) of the land cut off from the peasants when serfdom was abolished and now used by the land-lords as a means of keeping the peasants in bondage; “b) for the eradication of the remnants of the serf-own-ing system which still exist in the Urals, the Altai, theWestern territory, and other regions of the country; “5) empowerment of courts to reduce exorbitant rents and to declare null and void all contracts entailing bon-dage. 
” The reader may perhaps wonder at the fact that the “agrarian programme” contains no demands whatever in fa-vour of the agricultural wage-workers. 
 On this score let us note that such demands have been included in the preced-ing section of the programme which contains the demandspresented by our Party “to safeguard the working class from physical and moral degeneration, and also to raiseits fighting capacity in the struggle for its emancipation”. 
The words we have underlined apply to all wage-workers, including those in agriculture, and all the 16 clauses of this section of the programme apply to the agricultural workers as well . 
 True, this combination of industrial and agricultural workers in one section, with the “agrarian” part of the pro-gramme limited to “peasant” demands, has the drawback that the demands in favour of the agricultural workersdo not strike the eye, are not discernible at first glance. 
A superficial acquaintance with the programme may evencreate the entirely wrong impression that we have delib-erately toned down the demands in favour of the agricul-tural wage-workers. 
 Needless to say, this impression would be quite false, for the drawback in question is at bottomof a purely external character. 
 It can be easily obviatedby closer acquaintance with the programme itself andthe commentaries on it (and it goes without saying that ourParty programme will “go to the people” only together with printed commentaries, and, what is far more important, with spoken commentaries as well). 
 Should some groupwish to make a special appeal to the agricultural workers,it need only select from all the demands in favour of theworkers those particular demands that are most impor-tant to farm labourers, hands hired by the day, etc. 
, and set them out in a separate pamphlet, leaflet, or in speeches. 
 From the standpoint of principle, the only correct way to edit the programme sections under analysis is one thatwill unite all demands in favour of the wage-workers in all branches of the national economy and will distinct-ly place in a special section demands in favour of the “peas-ants”, because the fundamental criterion of what we canand must demand in the former and latter cases is abso-lutely different . 
 In the draft, the fundamental difference between the two sections of the programme under reviewis expressed in the preamble to each section. 
 For wage-workers we demand such reforms as would “safeguard them from physical and moral degenerationand raise their fighting capacity”; for the peasants, how-ever, we seek only such changes as would help “to erad-icate the remnants of the old serf-owning system andfacilitate the free development of the class struggle in the countryside”. 
 Hence it follows that our demands in favour of the peasants are far more restricted, that their termsare much more moderate and presented in a smaller frame-work. 
 With regard to the wage-workers, we undertake to defend their interests as a class in present-day society ; we do this because we consider their class movement the only truly revolutionary movement (cf. 
 the words in the theo-retical part of the programme on the relation of the workingclass to other classes) and strive to organise this particularmovement, to direct it, and bring the light of socialist con-sciousness into it. 
 As regards the peasantry, however, we do not by any means undertake to defend its interests as a class of small landowners and farmers in present-day society . 
 Noth-ing of the kind. 
 The emancipation of the workers mustbe the act of the working class itself”, and for this reasonSocial-Democracy represents— directly and wholly —the interests of the proletariat alone, and seeks indissoluble organic unity with its class movement alone. 
 All the oth-er classes of present-day society stand for the preserva-tion of the foundations of the existing economic system,and that is why Social-Democracy can undertake to defendthe interests of those classes only under certain circum-stances and on concrete and strictly defined conditions. 
 For instance, in its struggle against the bourgeoisie, the class of small producers, including the small farmers,is a reactionary class, and therefore “trying to save the peasantry by protecting small-scale farming and smallholdings from the onslaught of capitalism would be auseless retarding of social development; it would mean deceiving the peasantry with illusions of the possibility of prosperity even under capitalism; it would meandisuniting the labouring classes and creating a privileged po-sition for the minority at the expense of the majority” ( Iskra , No. 
 3). 
 * That is why in our draft programme the inclusion of the “peasant” demands hinges on two highly circumscribed conditions . 
 We make the legitimacy of “peasant demands” in a Social-Democratic programme dependent, firstly, onthe condition that they lead to the eradication of remnantsof the serf-owning system, and, secondly, that they facili-tate the free development of the class struggle in the coun-tryside. 
 *See present edition, Vol. 
 4, pp. 
 422-23. 
— Ed. 
 Let us dwell in greater detail on each of these condi-tions, which have already been briefly outlined in No. 
 3 of Iskra . 
 The “remnants of the old serf-owning system” are still extremely numerous in our countryside. 
 This is a generallyknown fact. 
 Labour-rent and bondage, the peasants’ inequal-ity as a social-estate and as citizens, their subjection to theprivileged landowners, who still have the right to flog them, and their degrading living conditions, which virtually turn the peasants into barbarians—all this is not an ex-ception, but the rule in the Russian countryside, and inthe final analysis this is all a direct survival of the serf-own-ing system. 
 In those instances and relationships wherethis system still prevails, and insofar as it still prevails, its enemy is the peasantry as a whole . 
 As opposed to serf-ownership, to the feudal-minded landlords, and the state thatserves them, the peasantry still stands as a class , a class not of capitalist but of serf-owning society, i. 
e. 
, as anestate-class. 
 * Inasmuch as this class antagonism between the “peasantry” and the privileged landowners, so char-acteristic of serf-owning society, still survives in our countryside, insomuch a working-class party must undoubt-edly be on the side of the “peasantry”, support its struggleand urge it on to fight against all remnants of serf-owner-ship. 
 We put the word “peasantry” in quotation marks in order to emphasise the existence in this case of an absolutely in-dubitable contradiction: in present-day society the peasant-ry of course no longer constitutes an integral class. 
 Butwhoever is perplexed by this contradiction forgets that thisis not a contradiction in exposition, in a doctrine, but a *We know that in slave and feudal societies, class divisions were also expressed in the division of the population into social-estates , each class with specific legal status in the state. 
 That is why classes in a society based on slavery and feudalism (and on serf-ownership)were also separate social-estates. 
 On the other hand, in capitalist, bourgeois society, all citizens are equal in law, division into social-estates has been abolished (at least in principle), and that is whyclasses have ceased to be social-estates. 
 The division of society intoclasses is a common feature to slave, feudal, and bourgeois societies,but in the two former estate-classes existed, whereas in the latterthe classes are not estates. 
 contradiction in life itself. 
 This is not an invented, but a living and dialectical contradiction. 
 Inasmuch as in our countryside serf-owning society is being eliminated by “pres-ent-day” (bourgeois) society, insomuch the peasantry ceases to be a class and becomes divided into the rural proletariatand the rural bourgeoisie (big, middle, petty, and verysmall). 
 Inasmuch as serf-owning relationships still exist, insomuch the “peasantry” still continues to be a class, i. 
e. 
, we repeat, a class of serf-owning society rather than of bour-geois society. 
 This “inasmuch—insomuch” exists in real lifein the form of an extremely complex web of serf-owning and bourgeois relationships in the Russian countryside today. 
To use Marx’s terminology, labour rent, rent in kind, moneyrent, and capitalist rent are all most fantastically interlinked in our country. 
 We lay special emphasis on this fact, which has been established by all economic investigations in Rus-sia, because it necessarily and inevitably constitutes a sourceof that complexity, confusion, or, if you will, artificialness,of some of our “agrarian” demands, which at first glance sogreatly puzzles many people. 
 Whoever limits his objections to general dissatisfaction with the complexity and “artful-ness” of the proposed solutions forgets that there can be no simple solution of such tangled problems. 
 It is our duty tofight against all remnants of serf-owning relationships—that is beyond doubt to a Social-Democrat—and sincethese relationships are most intricately interwoven with bourgeois relationships, we are obliged to penetrate into the very core, so to say, of this confusion, undeterred by thecomplexity of the task. 
 There could be only one “simple” solu-tion of this task: to keep aloof, pass it by, and leave it to the“spontaneous element” to clear up this mess. 
 But this “sim-plicity”, favoured by all and sundry bourgeois and “econo-mist” admirers of spontaneity, is unworthy of a Social-Democrat. 
 The party of the proletariat must not only supportbut must also urge on the peasantry in its struggle againstall the remnants of the serf-owning system. 
 To urge thepeasantry on, it must not confine itself to wishful thinking;it must lay down a definite revolutionary directive, and be able to help in finding the bearings in the maze of agrarian relationships. 
 III For the reader to get a clearer idea of the inevitability of a complex solution of the agrarian question, we would askhim to compare in this respect the workers’ and the peasants’sections of the programme. 
 In the former, all the solutionsare extremely simple and comprehensible even to the mostuninitiated and least imaginative person; they are “natural”, tangible, and easily achievable. 
 In the latter, on the contra-ry, most of the solutions are extremely complex, “incompre-hensible” at first glance, artificial, improbable, and diffi-cult to bring about. 
 How can this difference be explained? Canit be that, in the first case, the compilers of the programmegave it sober and business-like consideration, whereas in the second case they were lost and confused, lapsing into roman-ticism and phrase-mongering? Such an explanation, it mustin truth be said, would be extremely “simple”, childishlysimple, and we are not at all surprised at Martynov hav-ing grasped at it. 
 It did not enter his mind that economicdevelopment itself had facilitated and simplified to the ut-most the practical solution of the workers’ minor problems. 
 Social and economic relationships in the sphere of large-scalecapitalist production have become (and are increasingly be-coming) so transparent, clear, and simplified that the nextsteps forward suggest themselves automatically, immedi-ately, and at first glance. 
 On the other hand, capitalism’s elimination of serf-ownership in the countryside has so con-fused and complicated social and economic relationshipsas to make it necessary to ponder deeply over the solution(in the spirit of revolutionary Social-Democracy) of the imme-diate practical questions, and it may be said in advance andwith full certainty that a “simple” solution cannot be invented. 
 Incidentally, once we have begun to compare the workers’ and the peasants’ sections of the programme, let us notestill another difference in principle between them. 
 Thisdifference may be briefly formulated as follows: in theworkers’ section we have no right to go beyond the bounds of demands for social reform; in the peasants’ section however, we must not stop at social-revolutionary demands. 
In other words: in the workers’ section we are definitely limited by the minimum programme; in the peasants’ sec-tion we can and must produce a maximum programme. 
 * Let us explain. 
 What we set forth in both sections is not our ultimate aim, but our immediate demands. 
 In both we should there-fore remain on the basis of present-day (=bourgeois) society. 
 Therein lies the similarity between the two sections. 
 How-ever, their fundamental difference consists in the fact that the workers’ section contains demands directed against the bourgeoisie , whereas the peasants’ section contains demands directed against the would-be serf-owning landlords (against the feudal lords, I would say, if the applicability of thisterm to our landed nobility were not so disputable **). 
 In the workers’ section we must confine ourselves to partial improvements in the existing, bourgeois, order. 
 In the peas-ants’ section we must strive to completely eradicate all the remnants of the serf-owning system from this existing order. 
In the workers’ section we cannot bring forward demandswhose significance would be tantamount to a final smashingof bourgeois rule: when we achieve this ultimate aim of ours, which has been adequately stressed elsewhere in the programme and which we “never for a moment” lose sightof in the struggle for the immediate demands, then we, theParty of the proletariat, shall no longer confine ourselves toquestions of this or that responsibility of the employers, or tosome factory housing, but shall take into our own hands the entire management and disposal of the whole of social pro-duction, and consequently, of distribution as well. 
 On thecontrary, in the peasants’ section we can and must bring ----*The objection that the demand for the restitution of the cut off lands is far from being the maximum of our immediate demands infavour of the peasantry (or of our agrarian demands in general) and that it is therefore not consistent will be dealt with later, when we speak of the concrete clauses of the programme we are defending. 
 Wemaintain, and shall endeavour to prove, that the demand for the“restitution of the cut-off lands” is the maximum that we can at presentadvance in our agrarian programme. 
 **Personally, I am inclined to decide this question in the affir-mative, but in the given instance, it is of course neither the place nor time for substantiating or even for proposing this solution, sincewhat we are concerned with now is the defence of the draft agrarianprogramme prepared collectively by the entire Editorial Board. 
 forward demands whose significance would be tantamount to the final smashing of the rule of the feudal-minded landlords and to the complete eradication of all traces of serf-ownership from our countryside. 
 We cannot present social-revolutionarydemands among the immediate demands in the workers’section, since the social revolution which overthrows the ruleof the bourgeoisie is the proletarian revolution which achievesour ultimate aim. 
 In the peasants’ section, we present social-revolutionary demands as well, since the social revolution which overthrows the rule of the serf-owning landlords (i. 
e. 
, asocial revolution of the bourgeoisie, like the Great FrenchRevolution) is also possible on the basis of the existing,bourgeois, order. 
 In the workers’ section, we keep to ourstand (conditionally, for the time being, with our own inde-pendent intentions and aims, but we nevertheless keep to our stand) in favour of social reforms, for what we are demand-ing here is only what the bourgeoisie can (in principle)concede to us without as yet losing its domination (and whatMessrs. 
 the Sombarts, Bulgakovs, Struves, Prokopovichesand Co. 
 therefore in advance advise the bourgeoisie to con-cede in all wisdom and good faith). 
 In the peasants’ section, however, we must, unlike the social-reformers , also demand what the feudal-minded landlords will not and cannot give us(or the peasants)—we must also demand what the revolution-ary movement of the peasantry can take only by force. 
 IV That is why the “simple” criterion of “feasibility”, with the aid of which Martynov so “easily” pulled our agrarianprogramme to pieces, is inadequate and worthless. 
 This cri-terion of direct and immediate “feasibility” is applicable in general only to the avowedly reformative sections and clausesof our programme, and by no means to the programme of arevolutionary party in general. 
 In other words, this crite-rion is applicable to our programme only by way of excep-tion, and by no means as a general rule. 
 Our programme must be feasible only in the broad and philosophical sense of the word, so that not a single letter in it will contradict thedirection of all social and economic evolution. 
 And since we have correctly determined this direction (in general and in particular), we must—in the name of our revolutionary prin-ciples and our revolutionary duty—fight with all our might , always and absolutely, for the maximum of our demands. 
 However, to try to determine in advance, before the final outcome of the struggle, in the course of that struggle, thatwe shall perhaps fail to achieve the entire maximum means lapsing into sheer philistinism. 
 Considerations of this kind always lead to opportunism, even if the authors of suchconsiderations may harbour no such intentions. 
 Indeed, is it not philistinism on Martynov’s part to dis-cern “romanticism” in the Iskra agrarian programme “because it is highly problematic whether the peasant masses can be brought into our movement under the present conditions” (Rabocheye Dyelo , No. 
 10, p. 
 58. 
 Italics mine)? This is a good example of those very “plausible” and very cheap arguments by means of which Russian Social-Democratism was simpli-fied to “economism”. 
 A closer look at this “plausible” argu-ment will show that it is a soap-bubble. 
 “Our movement” is the Social-Democratic labour movement. 
 The peasant masses cannot just be “brought” into it : that is not problematic but impossible , and there was never any question of it. 
 How-ever, the peasant masses cannot but be brought into the “movement” against all the remnants of the serf-owningsystem (including the autocracy). 
 Martynov confused mat-ters by using the expression “our movement”, without giving thought to the fundamental difference between the characterof the movement against the bourgeoisie and against the serf-owning system. 
 * *How little thought Martynov has given to the question he has undertaken to write on is most vividly seen from the following state-ment in his article: “In view of the fact that the agrarian section of ourprogramme will still be of comparatively little practical significance for a very long time to come , it affords a wide field for revolutionary phrase-mongering. 
” The underlined words contain the very confusionindicated in the text. 
 Martynov has heard that in the West agrarianprogrammes are put forward only when there is a highly developedworking-class movement. 
 In our country this movement is just begin-ning. 
 Hence, our publicist hastens to conclude—“for a very long time to come”! He has overlooked a trifle: in the West agrarian programmes are written for the purpose of drawing those who are half-peasants , It is not the bringing of the peasant masses into the move-ment against remnants of serf-ownership that can be called problematic, but perhaps only the degree to which they are so brought: serf-owning relationships in the country-side are closely interwoven with bourgeois relationships, and as a class of bourgeois society the peasants (the small farm-ers) are far more a conservative than a revolutionary element (particularly since in our country the bourgeois evolution of agricultural relationships is only just begin-ning). 
 That is why, in a period of political reforms, it will be far easier for the government to split the peasants (than, for instance, the workers), far easier for it to weaken (or even,at the worst, to paralyse) their revolutionary spirit by means of minor and insignificant concessions to a comparatively small number of petty proprietors. 
 All this is true. 
 But what follows from it? The easier it is for the government to come to terms with the conservative elements of the peasantry, the greater must be our efforts,and the sooner we must exert them, to reach agreement with its revolutionary elements. 
 It is our duty to determine with the greatest possible scientific precision the direction along which we must support these elements, and then to urge them to wage a resolute and unconditional struggle half-workers into the Social -Democratic movement against the bour-geoisie ; while in our country such programmes are meant to draw the peasant masses into the democratic movement against the remnants of the serf-owning system . 
 That is why in the West the significance of the agrarian programme will become all the greater , the more agricultural capitalism develops. 
 The practical significance of our agrarian pro-gramme will decrease , as far as most of its demands are concerned, the more agricultural capitalism develops, since the remnants of serf-ownership this programme is directed against are dying out both ofthemselves and as the result of the government’s policy. 
 Our agrarianprogramme is, therefore, calculated in practice mainly for the immedi-ate future, for the period preceding the downfall of the autocracy. 
 A political revolution in Russia will at all events lead inevitably tosuch fundamental changes in our most backward agrarian system thatwe shall unfailingly have to revise our agrarian programme. 
 ButMartynov is quite sure of only one thing: that Kautsky’s book 47 i s good (this is warranted), and that it is sufficient to repeat and tran-scribe Kautsky without bearing in mind how radically different Russia is with regard to the agrarian programme (this is not at allwise). 
 against all remnants of the serf-owning system, to urge them on at all times and under all circumstances, by all available means. 
 And is it not philistinism to attempt to “prescribe” in advance the degree of success that will attend our urging? That will be decided by life and recorded by history; ourpresent job, in any case, is to fight on, and fight to the end. 
Does a soldier who has already gone into the attack dareargue that we perhaps will wipe out not an entire enemy army corps, but only three-fifths of it? Is not such a demand as, for instance, the demand for a republic also “problematic” in the Martynov sense? It will surely be easier for the govern-ment to make partial payment on this bill than to meet the bill of the peasant demands for the eradication of all tracesof the serf-owning system. 
 But what is that to us? We shall, of course, pocket this partial payment, without however calling off our desperate struggle for full payment. 
 We must spread the idea far and wide that only in a republiccan the decisive battle between the proletariat and the bour-geoisie take place; we must create * and consolidate repub-lican traditions among all the Russian revolutionaries and among the broadest possible masses of Russian workers; we should express through this “republic” slogan that we willcarry to the end the struggle to democratise the state system,without looking back—and the struggle will itself determinewhat share of that payment, when and how, we shall succeedin winning. 
 It would be stupid to try to calculate that share before we make the enemy feel the full force of our blows and without ourselves feeling the full force of his blows. 
 Simi-larly, with regard to the peasant demands, our job is to de-termine, on the basis of scientific data, the maximum o f these demands and to help the comrades to fight for this max-*We say “create”, because the old Russian revolutionaries never paid serious attention to the question of a republic, never consideringit a “practical” issue—the Narodniks, the rebels, etc. 
, because oftheir contemptuous anarchist attitude towards politics, those in theNarodnaya Volya 48 because they wanted to leap straight from the autocracy into the socialist revolution. 
 It has fallen to our lot (if we leave out of account the long forgotten republican ideas of theDecembrists) to the lot of the Social-Democrats, to popularise thedemand for a republic among the masses and to create republicantraditions among the Russian revolutionaries. 
 imum—and then let the sober legal critics and the illegal “tail-enders”, the latter so enamoured of tangible results, laugh at its “problematic” character! * V We shall now proceed to the second general proposition, which defines the nature of all our peasant demands and is expressed in the following words: “... for the purpose of *It would perhaps be useful, in discussing the “feasibility” of the demands in the Social-Democratic programme, to recall Karl Kaut-sky’s polemic against Rosa Luxemburg in 1896. 
 Rosa Luxemburg wrote that the demand for Poland’s restoration was inappropriate in the Polish Social-Democrats’ practical programme, since this demandcould not be realised in present-day society. 
 Karl Kautsky took excep-tion to this, saying that this argument was “based on a strange miscon-ception of the essence of a socialist programme. 
 Whether they finddirect expression in the programme or are tacitly accepted ‘postulates,’ our practical demands should be conformed ( werden ... darnach bemes-sen), not with their being achievable under the given alignment of forces, but with their compatibility with the existing social system, and with the consideration whether they can facilitate and further ( fördern ) the proletariat’s class struggle, and pave ( ebnen ) for it the way to the political rule of the proletariat. 
 In this, we take no account of the current alignment of forces. 
 The Social-Democratic programme is not written for the given (“ den”) moment—as far as possible, it should cover ( ausreichen ) all eventualities in present-day society. 
 It should serve not only for practical action ( der Action ), but for propaganda as well, in the form of concrete demands, it should indicate, more vividlythan abstract arguments can do, the direction in which we intend to advance. 
 The more distant practical aims we can set ourselves without straying into Utopian speculations, the better the direction in whichwe are advancing will be all the clearer to the masses—even to thosewho are unable to grasp ( erfassen ) our theoretical premises. 
 The pro-gramme should show what we demand of existing society or of the existing state, and not what we expect of it. 
 As an example, let us take the programme of German Social-Democracy. 
 It demands that officials should be elected by the people. 
 Measured by Miss Luxemburg’sstandards, this demand is just as Utopian as the demand for the estab-lishment of a Polish national state. 
 No one will be deluded into believ-ing that it is possible to ensure that, under the political conditionsobtaining in the German Reich, government officials are elected by the people. 
 With just as good reason as one can assume that a Polish national state is achievable only when the proletariat wins politicalpower, one can assert this concerning the above demand. 
 But is thatsufficient ground for not including it in our practical programme?”(Neue Zeit , XIV. 
 2, S.

) facilitating the free development of the class struggle in the countryside .... 
” These words are of the utmost importance both for the principled presentation of the agrarian question in general,and for an appraisal of individual agrarian demands inparticular. 
 The demand for the eradication of the remnantsof the serf-owning system is common to us and to all theconsistent liberals, Narodniks, social-reformers, critics of Marxism on the agrarian question, etc. 
, etc. 
 In advancing this demand, we differ from all these gentlemen, not in prin-ciple, but only in degree: in this point too they will inevi-tably remain at all times within the limits of reforms; we,however, will not stop (in the sense indicated above) evenat social-revolutionary demands. 
 On the contrary, by demanding that the “free development of the class struggle in the countryside” be ensured, we place ourselves in opposi-tion to all these gentlemen in principle , and even to all revo-lutionaries and socialists who are not Social-Democrats. 
 These latter will also not stop at social-revolutionarydemands in the agrarian question, but they will not wish to subordinate these demands precisely to such a condition as the free development of the class struggle in the country-side. 
 This condition is the fundamental and focal point inthe theory of revolutionary Marxism in the sphere of theagrarian question. 
 * To acknowledge this condition means recognising that, despite all its confusion and complexity, despite all the diversity of its forms, the evolution of agri-culture is also capitalist evolution, that (like the evolutionof industry) it also engenders the proletariat’s class struggleagainst the bourgeoisie, that precisely this class struggle must be our prime and fundamental concern, the touchstonefor both questions of principle and political tasks, as well as methods of propaganda, agitation, and organisation. 
 To acknowledge this condition means undertaking to abide un-*In essence all the delusions and fallacies of the “critics” of Marxism on the agrarian question boil down to a failure to understand this very point, and the boldest and most consistent (and to that extent the most honest) of them, Mr. 
 Bulgakov, openly declares inhis “survey” that the “doctrine” of the class struggle is quite inapplic-able to agricultural relationships. 
 ( Capitalism and Agriculture , Vol. 
 II, p. 
 289. 
) swervingly by the class viewpoint also in the very painful question of the participation of the small peasants in the Social-Democratic movement, means sacrificing nothing of the proletariat’s standpoint in favour of the interests of thepetty bourgeoisie, but, on the contrary, demanding that thesmall peasant, who is being oppressed and ruined by allmodern capitalism, should desert his own class standpoint and place himself at the standpoint of the proletariat. 
 By setting this condition, we shall resolutely and irrevo-cably put ourselves apart, not only from our enemies (i. 
e. 
, the direct or indirect, conscious or unconscious supportersof the bourgeoisie, who are our temporary and partial alliesin the struggle against the remnants of the serf-owning sys-tem), but also from those unreliable friends who, because of their mid-course presentation of the agrarian question, can cause (and actually do cause) much harm to the proletariat’srevolutionary movement. 
 By setting this condition, we are providing a guiding principle that will enable any Social-Democrat, even if hefinds himself in some out-of-the-way village, even if he is faced with the most tangled web of agrarian relationships which bring general democratic tasks into the foreground, to apply and stress his proletarian standpoint when heis tackling those tasks—just as we remain Social-Demo-crats when we tackle general -democratic, political problems. 
 By setting this condition, we are replying to the objection that many people bring forward after a cursory acquaintance with the concrete demands in our agrarian programme.... 
“Redemption payments and cut-off lands shall be restitutedto the village communes ”!?—But, then, where is our specifi-cally proletarian complexion and our proletarian indepen-dence? Is this not in effect a gift to the rural bourgeoisie?? Of course it is—but only in the sense that the fall of the serf-owning system was itself a “gift to the bourgeoisie”,i. 
e. 
, since it relieved bourgeois, and not some other develop-ment, from the fetters and restrictions of the serf-owning sys-tem. 
 The proletariat is distinguished from all the otherclasses oppressed by and opposed to the bourgeoisie for the very reason that it rests its hopes, not on a retardation of bourgeois development, or on any abatement or slackeningof the class struggle, but, on the contrary, on the fullest and freest development of the class struggle, on the acceleration of bourgeois progress. 
 * In a developing capitalist society it is impossible to eradicate the remnants of the serf-owning system which hamper its development, in such a way as notto strengthen and fortify the bourgeoisie. 
 To be “baffled”by this is equivalent to repeating the mistake of those social-ists who said that we have no need of political liberty sinceit might strengthen and fortify the rule of the bourgeoisie. 
 VI Having examined the “general section” of our agrarian programme, we shall now proceed to analyse its specificdemands. 
 We shall take the liberty of beginning not with the first but with the fourth clause (on the cut-off lands), since this is the most important and the central clause, theone that lends a special character to the agrarian programmeand is at the same time its most vulnerable point (at anyrate, in the view of most of those who voiced their opinionson the article in No. 
 3 of Iskra ). 
 Let us recall that this clause is made up of the following components: 1. 
 It demands the establishment of peasant com-mittees with authority to reorganise agrarian relationshipsthat are direct survivals of the serf-owning system. 
 The ex-pression “peasant committees” has been chosen to make it quite clear that, as distinct from the “Reform” of 1861 with its committees of nobles, 49 the reorganisation of these relationships must rest with the peasants, and not with the landowners. 
 In other words: the final abolition of relation-ships stemming from the serf-owning system is left, not tothe oppressors, but to the section of the population which is oppressed by these relationships; not to the minority, but to the majority of those concerned. 
 In essence, this is nothingbut a democratic revision of the peasant reform (i. 
e. 
, the very thing demanded by the first draft programme prepared by *It stands to reason that the proletariat does not support all measures accelerating bourgeois progress, but only those that tenddirectly to strengthen the capacity of the working class to struggle for its emancipation. 
 And “labour rent” and bondage weigh upon thepoor section of the peasantry, which is close to the proletariat, much more heavily than upon the well-to-do section of the peasantry. 
 the Emancipation of Labour group). 
 And the only reason we have not chosen this latter expression is because it in-dicates the true nature and concrete substance of this re-vision less definitely and less expressively. 
 Therefore, ifMartynov, for instance, really had some contribution tomake on the agrarian question, he should have stateddefinitely whether he rejects the very idea of a democraticrevision of the peasant reform, and if not, then he should have stated just how he pictures it. 
 * Further, 2. 
 The peasant committees are given the right to expropriate and redeem landlords’ land, to effect ex-changes of land, and so on (Clause 4,b); moreover, this rightis limited to cases where there is a direct survival of serf-owning relationships. 
 Specifically (3), the right to expropriate and redeem is granted only with regard to land which, first, was “cut off from the peasants when serfdom was abolished”(since time immemorial this land had been an essentialappurtenance of the peasant farm, part and parcel of thatfarm, and was artificially severed from it by the legalisedrobbery known as the great Peasant Reform)—and, secondly, is “used by the landlords as a means of keeping the peasants in bondage”. 
 This second condition still more limits the right of redemp-tion and expropriation, extending it, not to all “cut-off lands”, *We note the inconsistency (or is it reservation?) of Nadezhdin, who has apparently adopted Iskra ’s idea of peasant committees in his outline of the agrarian programme, but formulates this idea mostlamely when he says: “The institution of a special court of people’s representatives to examine peasant complaints and statements with regard to all the transactions attending the ‘Emancipation’. 
” ( The Eve of the Revolution , p. 
 65. 
 Italics mine. 
) One can complain only about a breach of the law. 
 The “Emancipation” of February 19, with all its “transactions”, itself constitutes a law. 
 The establishment of special courts to examine complaints about the injustice of a given law is senseless until that law is repealed, or new legislative standards have been set up to replace this law (or to annul it in part). 
 The “court”should be invested not only with the right to receive “complaints”about lands cut off from pastures but also the right to return ( resp . 
 redeem, etc. 
) that pasture land—but in that case, first, a “court”authorised to make laws would no longer be a court; secondly, it is necessary to indicate definitely just what rights of expropriation, redemption, etc. 
, this “court” would have. 
 But however inapt Nadezh-din’s formulation may be, he has grasped the need for a democraticrevision of the Peasant Reform much better than Martynov has. 
 but only to such that to this day remain instruments of bond-age and “by means of which”, as Iskra has formulated it, “forced labour, bondage, the corvée system, i. 
e. 
, in actual fact the very same serf labour, is still maintained ”. 
 In other words, wherever the half-hearted nature of our Peasant Reform hasled to serf-owning forms of farming surviving to this day,with the aid of land cut off from the peasants’ lands, the peas-ants are given the right to do away with these survivals once and for all, even by means of expropriation, the right to the “ restitution of the cut-off lands ”. 
 We can therefore reassure our kind-hearted Martynov, who has asked with such alarm: “What should be done aboutthose cut-off lands in the possession of the nobility or pur-chasers of non-noble origin, which are now being cultivated along model, capitalist lines?” It is not a question of these particular cut-off lands, my worthy friend, but rather ofthose typical (and extremely numerous) cut-off lands whichto this very day serve as a basis for still existing remnantsof the serf-owning system. 
 Finally, 4. 
 Clause 4, b, empowers the peasant committees to eradicate remnants of serf-owning system which still sur-vive in certain parts of the country (servitude, uncompletedallotment of land, its demarcation, and so forth and soon). 
 Hence, for the sake of simplicity, the entire content of Clause 4 may be briefly expressed as “restitution of the cut-off lands”. 
 The question arises: how did the idea of this demand originate? It arose as the direct outcome of the gener-al and fundamental proposition that we must assist the peasants and urge them to destroy all remnants of the serf-owning system as completely as possible. 
 This meets with “general approval”, doesn’t it? Well then, if you do agree to follow this road, make an effort to proceed along it inde-pendently; don’t make it necessary to drag you; don’t let the “unusual” appearance of this road frighten you, don’t be put out by the fact that in many places you will find no beaten track at all, and that you will have to crawl along the edge of precipices, break your way through thickets, and leap across chasms. 
 Don’t complain of the poor road: these com-plaints will be futile whining, for you should have known in advance that you would be moving, not along a highway that has been graded and levelled by all the forces of social progress, but along paths through out-of-the-way places and back-alleys which do have a way out, but from which you, we or anyone else will never find a direct, simple, and easyway out—“never”, i. 
e. 
, whilst these disappearing, but soslowly disappearing, out-of-the-way places and back-alleyscontinue to exist. 
 But if you do not want to stray into these back-alleys, then say so frankly and don’t try to get away by phrase-mongering. 
 * You agree to fight for the abolition of the remnants of the serf-owning system? Very well. 
 Remember, however, thatthere does not exist a single juridical institution to express or stipulate these remnants—I am of course speaking of those remnants exclusively in the sphere of the agrarian relationships that we are discussing now, and not in the sphereof legislation relating to the social-estates, financial affairs,etc. 
 Direct survivals of the corvée system, recorded timeswithout number in all the economic surveys of Russia, aremaintained, not by any special law which protects them, but by the actually existing land relationships. 
 This is so to such an extent that witnesses testifying before the well-knownValuyev Commission 50 openly stated that serf-ownership would undoubtedly have been revived had it not been *For instance, Martynov levels a charge of “phrase-mongering” against Iskra , which has given him both the general principles of its agrarian policy (“the introduction of the class struggle into the country-side”) and a practical answer to the question of concrete programmedemands. 
 Without replacing these general principles with any others,without giving even the slightest thought to these principles, ormaking any attempt to draw up a definite programme, Martynovdismisses the whole matter with the following grandiloquent words: “... We must demand their [the peasants’ as petty proprietors] pro-tection ... against various obsolete forms of economic bondage.... 
”Isn’t that getting off rather cheaply? Couldn’t you try to point out to usat least one protective measure against at least one (let alone “various”!) obsolete form of bondage? (Evidently there are also “forms of bondage”that are not obsolete!!) After all, the small credit associations, the amalgamated dairies, the mutual aid societies, the associations of small farmers the peasant banks, and the Zemstvo agronomists arelikewise all “protective measures against various obsolete forms ofeconomic bondage”. 
 Does it follow that you propose that “we mustdemand” all this?? You had better do some thinking first, my goodfriend, and then speak of programmes! directly prohibited by law. 
 Hence, one of two things: either you refrain altogether from touching upon the land relation-ships between the peasants and the landlords—in which case all the remaining questions are solved very “simply”, butthen you will also be ignoring the main source of all thesurvivals of serf-owning economy in the countryside, andwill “simply” be avoiding a burning question bearing on themost vital interests of the feudal landlords and the enslaved peasantry, a question which tomorrow or the day after may easily become one of the most pressing social and politicalissues in Russia. 
 Or else you want also to touch upon the sourceof the “obsolete forms of economic bondage” representedby the land relationships—in which case you must reckonwith the fact that these relationships are so complex and entangled that they do not actually permit of any easy or simple solution. 
 Then, if you are not satisfied with the concretesolutions we have proposed for this complex question, you nolonger have the right to get away with a general “com-plaint” about its complexity, but must attempt to cope with it independently, and propose some other concrete solution. 
 The importance of the cut-off lands in present-day peas-ant farming is a question of reality. 
 And it is noteworthy thatdeep as the gulf is between Narodism (in the broad sense ofthe word) and Marxism in the appraisal of the economicsystem and the economic evolution of Russia, the two doc-trines have no divergence on this question. 
 Representatives of both trends are agreed that the Russian countryside is teeming with remnants of serf-ownership and ( nota bene ) that the predominant mode of private farming in the centralgubernias of Russia (the “labour-rent system of farming”)is a direct survival of the serf-owning system. 
 They are agreedfurthermore that the cutting-off of peasant land in favour of the landlords—i. 
e. 
, both the cutting-off in the downright literal sense and the depriving of the peasants of the rightto use common lands as pasturage, the right to use wood-lands, watering places, grazing grounds, and so forth—con-stitutes one of the mainstays ( if not the mainstay ) of the la-bour-rent system. 
 It will suffice to recall that, according to the most recent data, the labour-rent system of landlord farming predominates in no less than 17 gubernias of European Russia . 
 Let those who regard the clause on the cut-off lands as a purely artificial, “laboured” and wily invention try to dispute this fact! Here is what the labour-rent system of farming means. 
 In actual fact, i. 
e. 
, not according to ownership but accord-ing to economic utilisation, the landlords’ and the peas-ants’ lands have not been divided up completely, but re-main merged; part of the peasants’ land, for example, feedscattle required for the cultivation not of the peasants’ land but of the landlords’ land; part of the landlords’ land is absolutely indispensable to the neighbouring peasantfarm as it is run at present (watering places, grazing grounds,etc. 
). 
 This actual interlinking of land tenures inevitably engenders the same (or, more precisely, preserves the thou-sand-year-old) relationships between muzhik and landlord that existed under the serf-owning system. 
 The muzhik re-mains a serf de facto , working with the same antiquated im-plements, on the basis of the old three-field system, for thesame old “lord of the manor”. 
 What else do you want, if thepeasants themselves everywhere bluntly call this labour rent“panshchina ” and “ barshchina ”, * if the landlords themselves say when they describe their farms: my land is worked by “my former...” (that is, not only former, but present as well!)“...peasants” with their own implements in exchange forthe use of my pasture land? Whenever it becomes necessary to solve any complex and entangled social and economic problem, it is an elementary rule that one should take the most typical case to begin with, the case that is freest of all extraneous complicatinginfluences and circumstances, and use the solution reachedin this case as a premise for further procedure, while takingstock of these extraneous and complicating circumstances,one by one. 
 Take a case that is most “typical” in this re-spect: the children of the former serfs are working for the sons of the former serf-owners to pay for the use of the latter’spasture lands. 
 Labour rent makes for stagnation in culti-vation techniques and for stagnation in all social and eco-nomic relationships in the countryside, since this labourrent hampers the development of money economy and the *Panshchina and barshchina are two equivalent terms, with roughly the meaning of the corvée system. 
— Ed. 
 /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR differentiation of the peasantry, disembarrasses the landlord (comparatively) of the stimulus of competition (instead of raising the technical level, he reduces the share of the share-cropper; incidentally, this reduction has been recorded in anumber of localities for many years of the post-Reform pe-riod), ties the peasant to the land, thereby checking theprogress of migration, outside employment, etc. 
 The question arises whether any Social-Democrat will doubt that in this “pure” case the expropriation of the cor-responding part of the landlords’ land in favour of the peas-ants is wholly natural, desirable, and achievable. 
 Thisexpropriation will rouse Oblomov 51 from his slumber and force him to introduce more advanced methods of farmingon his smaller estate; this expropriation will undermine (I will not say destroy, but precisely undermine) the labour-rent system, encourage the spirit of independence anddemocracy among the peasantry, raise their standard ofliving, and give a powerful impulse to the further develop-ment of money economy and capitalist progress in agricul-ture. 
 And in general: once it is generally acknowledged that the cut-off lands are one of the principal roots of the labour-rent system—and this system is a direct survival of serf-ownership which retards the development of capitalism—how can one doubt that the restitution of the cut-off landswill undermine the labour-rent system and accelerate social and economic progress? VII There are nevertheless very many who have doubted this, and we shall now proceed to consider the arguments advanced by the doubters. 
 All these arguments may be classified in the following groups: a) Is the demand for the restitution ofthe cut-off lands consistent with the basic theoretical prin-ciples of Marxism and with the principles of the Social-Dem-ocratic programme? b) Is it wise, from the viewpoint ofpolitical expedience, to advance the demand for redressing a historical injustice, the significance of which is diminish-ing with every step in economic development? c) Canthis demand be realised in practice? d) Admitting that we can and must advance such a demand and include in our agrarian programme not the minimum but the maximum, is the demand for the restitution of the cut-off lands consis-tent from this point of view? Is such a demand actually amaximum? As far as I can judge, all objections “against the cut-off lands” fit into one or another of these four groups; moreover,most of the objectors (including Martynov) have answered all four questions in the negative, considering the demand for the restitution of the cut-off lands wrong in principle,politically inexpedient, practically unattainable, and logi-cally inconsistent. 
 Let us consider all these questions in their order of impor-tance. 
 a) The demand for the restitution of the cut-off lands is considered wrong in principle for two reasons. 
 In the firstplace, we are told that it will “affect” capitalist agriculture,i. 
e. 
, hold up or delay the development of capitalism; inthe second place, we are told that it will not only fortifybut actually multiply small property. 
 The first of these argu-ments (particularly emphasised by Martynov) is absolutely untenable, because, on the contrary, typical cut-off landsretard the development of capitalism, and their restitutionwill stimulate this development; as for non-typical cases(quite apart from the fact that exceptions are always andeverywhere possible and only go to prove the rule), a res-ervation was made both in Iskra and in the programme (“... the land cut off ... and now used as a means of bondage...”). 
This objection is due simply to ignorance of the real impor-tance of the cut-off lands and labour rent in the economy ofthe Russian countryside. 
 The second argument (which was developed in particular detail in several private letters) is much more serious and is in general the strongest argument against the programmewe are defending. 
 Generally speaking, it is not at all the taskof the Social-Democrats to develop, support, consolidate,let alone, multiply, small-scale farming and small property. 
That is quite true. 
 But the point is that what confronts us here is not a “general” but an exceptional case of small-scale farming, and this exceptional character is clearly expressed in the preamble to our agrarian programme: “the destruc-tion of the remnants of the serf-owning system and the free development of the class struggle in the countryside. 
” Gen-erally speaking, it is reactionary to support small proper-ty because such support is directed against large-scale capital-ist economy and, consequently, retards social development, and obscures and glosses over the class struggle. 
 In this case,however, we want to support small property not against capi-talism but against serf-ownership; in this case, by supporting the small peasantry, we give a powerful impulse to the devel-opment of the class struggle. 
 Indeed, on the one hand, we arethus making a last attempt to fan the embers of the peasants’ class (social-estate) enmity for the feudal-minded landlords. 
On the other hand, we are clearing the way for the develop-ment of the bourgeois class antagonism in the countryside, because that antagonism is at present masked by what is supposedly the common and equal oppression of all the peas-ants by the remnants of the serf-owning system. 
 There are two sides to all things in the world. 
 In the West, the peasant proprietor has already played his part in the dem-ocratic movement, and is now defending his position of privilege as compared with the proletariat. 
 In Russia, the peasant proprietor is as yet on the eve of a decisive andnation-wide democratic movement with which he cannotbut sympathise. 
 He still looks ahead more than he looksback. 
 He is still more of a fighter against the privileges of theformer serf-owners as a social-estate, privileges which are still so strong in Russia, than a defender of his own privileged position. 
 In a historic moment like the present , it is our di-rect duty to support the peasants and to try to direct theiras yet vague and blind discontent against their real enemy. 
And we shall not be in the least contradicting ourselves ifwe delete from our programme the struggle against the rem-nants of the serf-owning system in the subsequent historical period when the special features of the present social andpolitical “juncture” will have disappeared, when the peas-ants, let us suppose, will have been satisfied by insignifi-cant concessions made to an insignificant number of property-owners and begin definitely to “snarl” at the proletariat. 
 Then, we shall probably also have to delete from our pro-gramme the struggle against the autocracy, for it is quiteinconceivable that the peasants will succeed in ridding them-selves of the most repulsive and grievous form of feudal oppression before political liberty has been attained. 
 Under the capitalist system of economy, small property retards the development of the productive forces by tyingthe worker to a small plot of land, by legalising old-fash-ioned techniques, and by making it difficult to bring landinto the trade turnover. 
 Where the labour-rent system predom-inates, small landed property, by ridding itself of labour rent, stimulates the development of the productive forces, releases the peasant from the bondage that tied him down toone particular place, relieves the landlord of “gratuitous”servants, makes it impossible for him to prefer unlimitedintensification of “patriarchal” exploitation to technicalimprovements, and facilitates land being brought into the trade turnover. 
 In a word, the contradictory position of the small peasant on the boundary between serf economy and cap-italist economy fully justifies this exceptional and temporarysupport of small property by the Social-Democrats. 
 We repeat:this is not a contradiction in the wording or in the formu-lation of our programme, but a contradiction in real life. 
 It may be argued: “However slowly the labour-rent farming may be yielding to the pressure of capitalism, still it is yield-ing; it is, moreover, doomed to disappear completely; large-scale labour-rent farming is giving way to, and will be direct-ly replaced by, large-scale capitalist farming. 
 What youwant is to accelerate the elimination of serf-owning by a mea-sure which in essence amounts to the splitting-up (partial, but nevertheless splitting-up) of large-scale farms. 
 Are younot thereby sacrificing the interests of the future for the inter-ests of the present? For the sake of the problematic possi-bility of a peasant revolt against serf-owning in the imme-diate future, you are placing obstacles in the way of a revolt of the agricultural proletariat against capitalism in the more or less distant future!” This argument, however convincing it may seem at first glance, is very one-sided: in the first place, the small peasant-ry is also yielding—slowly no doubt, but nevertheless yield-ing—to the pressure of capitalism, and is likewise ultimately doomed to inevitable elimination; in the second place, large-scale labour-rent farming too is not always “directly” re-placed by large-scale capitalist farming; it quite often gives rise to a section of semi-dependent peasants—semi-farm la-bourers, semi-proprietors. 
 And yet, such a revolutionary measure as the restitution of the cut-off lands would render a tremendous service precisely by substituting, at least once,the “method” of open revolutionary transformation for the“method” of gradual and imperceptible transformation ofserf dependence into bourgeois dependence: this could not fail to exert the profoundest influence on the spirit of protest and the independent struggle of the entire rural working popula-tion. 
 In the third place, we, Russian Social-Democrats, willalso try to make use of the experience of Europe, and beginto attract the “country folk” to the socialist working-classmovement at a much earlier stage and much more zealouslythan was done by our Western comrades, who after the con-quest of political liberty, continued for a long time to “grope” for the road the industrial workers’ movement shouldfollow: in this sphere we shall take much that is ready-made“from the Germans”, but in the agrarian sphere we may per-haps evolve something new. 
 And in order to facilitate forour farm labourers and semi-farm labourers the subsequent transition to socialism, it is highly important that the so-cialist party begin to “stand up ” at once for the small peas-ants, and do “everything possible” for them, never refusinga hand in solving the urgent and complex “alien” (non-pro-letarian) problems, and helping the working and exploitedmasses to regard the socialist party as their leader and rep-resentative. 
 To proceed. 
 b) The demand for the restitution of the cut-off lands is considered politically inexpedient, since, it isargued, it is imprudent to switch the attention of the Partyfrom the fundamental and imminent issue of the strugglebetween the proletariat and the bourgeoisie over to the redressing of all sorts of historical injustices, which are already beginning to lose immediate significance. 
 As Mar-tynov sarcastically puts it, this amounts to “re-emancipat-ing the peasants forty years too late”. 
 This argument too appears plausible, but only at first glance. 
 Historical injustices are of different kinds. 
 There are such which, as it were, keep aloof from the mainstream of history, do not check that stream or hinder its course, and donot prevent the proletarian class struggle from extending and from striking deeper roots. 
 It would certainly be unwise to try to redress historical injustices of this kind. 
 As an example, we shall mention the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine by Ger-many. 
 No Social-Democratic party would think of includingin its programme the redress of a wrong of this kind, although, on the other hand, not one would shirk its duty of protestingagainst this injustice and of condemning all the ruling classesfor having perpetrated it. 
 If we had motivated our demand for the restitution of the cut-off lands only on the ground that an injustice had been committed and should be redressed,that would have been no more than a hollow democraticphrase. 
 However, we do not make any plaint over a historicalinjustice the motivation of our demand, but rather the needto abolish the remnants of the serf-owning system and to clear the road for the class struggle in the countryside, i. 
e. 
, a very “practical” and very pressing need for the proletariat. 
 We have here an example of a different kind of historical injustice, one which still directly retards social development and the class struggle. 
 A refusal to attempt to redress histor-ical injustices of this kind would mean “defending the knout on the ground that it is a historical knout”. 
 The problem of freeing our countryside from the burden of the remnants ofthe “old regime” is one of the most urgent questions of theday, one that is put forward by all trends and parties (exceptthat of the former serf-owners), so that the reference to ourbeing late is pointless in general and simply ludicrous when voiced by Martynov. 
 It is the Russian bourgeoisie who were “late” with what is really their task of sweeping away all the remnants of the old regime, and we must and shallrectify this omission until it has been rectified, until we havewon political liberty, as long as the position of the peas-ants continues to foster dissatisfaction among practically the whole of educated bourgeois society (as is the case in Russia), instead of fostering a feeling of conservative self-satisfaction among it on account of the “indestructibility” ofwhat is supposed to be the strongest bulwark against social-ism (as is the case in the West where this self-satisfaction isdisplayed by all the parties of Order, ranging from the Agrar-ians and Conservatives pur sang , through the liberal and free-thinking bourgeois, to even as far—without offence toMessrs. 
 the Chernovs and the Vestnik Russkoi Revolutsii !—to even as far as the fashionable “critics of Marxism” in the agrarian question). 
 Then, of course, those Russian Social-Democrats who trail along in the rear of the movement as a matter of principle, and who are concerned only with questions“promising palpable results”, were also “late”, and, becausethey were late in giving definite directives on the agrarianquestion as well, these “tail-enders” have succeeded only inproviding the non-Social-Democratic revolutionary trends with a highly potent and reliable weapon. 
 As for c) the practical “infeasibility” of the demand that the cut-off lands should be restituted, this objection (whichhas been particularly stressed by Martynov) is of the feeblest. 
In conditions of political liberty, the question of determiningin which concrete cases expropriation, redemption, exchange, demarcation, etc. 
, should be carried out and exactly how this should be done would be solved by the peasant committeesten times more easily than by the committees of nobles,which consisted of representatives of a minority and acted inthe interests of that minority. 
 Only those who are used to un-derestimating the revolutionary activity of the masses can attach any importance to this objection. 
 At this point the fourth and last objection is raised. 
 If we are to count on the revolutionary activity of the peasantsand offer them a maximum and not a minimum programme,we must be consistent and demand either a peasant “GeneralRedistribution” 52 or bourgeois nationalisation of the land! “If,” writes Martynov, “we wanted to find a genuine ( sic!) class slogan for the mass of the small peasantry, we shouldhave to go further and advance the demand for a ‘General Re-distribution’, but then we should have to part with theSocial-Democratic programme. 
” This reasoning betrays the “economist” most strikingly, and reminds us of the saying about those who, if they are compelled to pray, do it with such zeal that they bang theirforeheads against the ground. 
 You have pronounced yourselves in favour of one of the demands which satisfy certain interests of a certain sec-tion of the small producers: hence it follows that you must de-sert your own standpoint and adopt the standpoint of that section!! Nothing of the sort follows; only “tail-enders”,who confuse the drawing-up of a programme conforming to a class’s broadly conceived interests with subservience to that class, can reason in this way. 
 Although we represent the proletariat, we will nevertheless condemn outright the prejudiced idea of backward proletarians that one must fightonly for demands “promising palpable results”. 
 While sup-porting the progressive interests and demands of the peas-ants, we will decisively reject their reactionary demands. 
The “General Redistribution”, one of the most outstanding slogans of the old Narodniks, represents a combination of just such revolutionary and reactionary features. 
 The So-cial-Democrats have stated dozens of times that they do notat all discard the whole of Narodism, with the forthrightnessof a certain foolish bird, but select and take for their own itsrevolutionary and general democratic elements. 
 The demand for “General Redistribution” contains the reactionary Utopian idea of generalising and perpetuating small-scale peasantproduction, but it also contains (in addition to the Utopianidea that the “peasantry” can serve as the vehicle of thesocialist revolution) a revolutionary element, namely, the desire to sweep away by means of a peasant revolt all the remnants of the serf-owning system. 
 In our opinion, the demand for the restitution of the cut-off lands singles outfrom all the peasant’s two-way and contradictory demandsprecisely that which can have a revolutionary effect onlyin the direction along which society’s entire developmentis proceeding, and consequently deserves the proletariat’s support. 
 In actual fact, Martynov’s invitation to “go fur-ther” only lands us in the absurd position of having to de-fine the “ genuine ” class slogan of the peasantry from the standpoint of the existing prejudices of the peasantry, and not from that of the properly understood interests of the pro-letariat. 
 Nationalisation of the land is a different matter. 
 This de-mand (if it is interpreted in the bourgeois sense, and not inthe socialist) does actually “go further” than the demand forthe restitution of the cut-off lands, and in principle wefully endorse it. 
 It goes without saying that, when the revo-lutionary moment comes, we shall not fail to advance it. 
 But our present programme is being drawn up, not only for the period of revolutionary insurrection, not even so much forthat period, as for the period of political slavery, for the period that precedes political liberty. 
 However, in this pe-riod the demand for the nationalisation of the land is much less expressive of the immediate tasks of the democratic movement in the meaning of a struggle against the serf-own-ing system. 
 The demand for the establishment of peasantcommittees and for the restitution of the cut-off lands kindlesthis class struggle in the countryside directly and, conse-quently, cannot give occasion for any experiments in state socialism. 
 The demand for the nationalisation of the land, on the other hand, to a certain extent diverts attention from themost striking manifestations and most outstanding survivalsof serf-ownership. 
 That is why our agrarian programme canand must be advanced at once as a means of stimulating thedemocratic movement among the peasants. 
 However, to ad-vance the demand for nationalisation of the land under the autocracy or even under a semi-constitutional monarchywould be quite wrong. 
 For, while we lack firmly establishedand deep-rooted democratic political institutions, thisdemand will be much more likely to distract our minds to-wards absurd experiments in state socialism than to provide a stimulus “for the free development of the class struggle in the countryside”. 
 * That is why we think that, on the basis of the present so-cial system, the maximum demand in our agrarian programmeshould not go beyond the democratic revision of the Peas-ant Reform. 
 The demand for nationalisation of the land, while quite valid in principle and quite suitable at certain moments, is politically inexpedient at the present moment. 
 It is interesting to note that, in his desire to reach just such a maximum as nationalisation of the land, Nadezhdinhas gone astray (partly owing to his decision to confine him-self in the programme “to demands which the muzhik under-stands and needs”). 
 Nadezhdin formulates the demand for nationalisation of the land as follows: “the conversion of *Kautsky very rightly remarked in one of his articles against Vollmar: “In Britain the advanced workers may demand nationalisa-tion of the land. 
 But what would be the outcome if, in a militaristand police state like Germany, all the land became state property(eine Domäne )? This sort of state socialism has been realised, at least, to a considerable degree, in Mecklenburg. 
” (“ Vollmar und der Staatsso-zialismus ”, Neue Zeit , 1891-92, X. 
 2, S. 
 710. 
) state, royal, church, and landlords’ lands into public proper-ty, into a national fund to be allocated to the working peas-antry on long-term leases and on the most advantageous terms. 
” The “muzhik” will, no doubt, understand this demand,but the Social-Democrat will probably not. 
 The demandfor nationalisation of the land is a demand of the Social-Dem-ocrat programme which is valid in principle only as abourgeois and not as a socialist measure, for, as socialists, we demand the nationalisation of all the means of production. 
 So long as we remain on the basis of bourgeois society we candemand only the transfer of ground rent to the state—a trans-fer which in itself far from retarding would accelerate thecapitalist evolution of agriculture. 
 It follows that, in the firstplace, a Social-Democrat, while supporting bourgeois nation-alisation of the land, must by no means exclude the peasants’ land, as Nadezhdin has done. 
 If we preserve a private system of economy on the land, merely abolishing private ownershipof land, it would be utterly reactionary to exclude the smallproprietor in this connection . 
 In the second place, if such nationalisation took place, a Social-Democrat would reso-lutely oppose the leasing of national land “to the working peasantry” in preference to the agrarian capitalists. 
 Thispreference would also be reactionary, given domination orpreservation of the capitalist mode of production. 
 If a demo-cratic country undertook to carry out bourgeois nationalisa-tion of the land, it would be the duty of that country’s pro-letariat to show no preference either for small or big leasehold-ers, but to demand unconditionally that every leaseholder observe the labour protection laws (on the maximum workingday, health regulations, etc. 
, etc. 
) and the laws governing ra-tional cultivation of the land and care of livestock. 
 Inpractice, the proletariat’s adoption of such a policy in the event of bourgeois nationalisation would of course be tantamount to hastening the victory of large-scale productionover small-scale (in the same way as factory legislation speeds up that victory in industry). 
 The desire to be “understood by the muzhik” at all costs has driven Nadezhdin into the jungle of a reactionarypetty-bourgeois Utopia. 
 * *As for Nadezhdin, he has in our opinion acted very inconsistently by demanding, in his outline of an agrarian programme, the conver-Thus, an analysis of objections to the demand for restitu-tion of the cut-off lands convinces us that these objections are groundless. 
 We must put forward the demand for the democratic revision of the Peasant Reform, or, to be precise,for the revision of the agrarian reforms contained in it. 
 Todetermine the precise character, limits, and manner of carry-ing out this revision, we must demand the establishment ofpeasant committees which shall have the right to expropri-ate, redeem, exchange, etc. 
, those cut-off lands in which sur-vivals of the serf-owning system of economy are rooted. 
 VIII The fifth clause in our draft agrarian programme is closely bound up with the fourth. 
 Clause 5 demands “empowerment of courts to reduce exorbitant rents and declare null and voidall contracts entailing bondage”. 
 Like Clause 4, it is directedagainst bondage; unlike Clause 4 it demands, not a singleact of revision and reform of the agrarian system, but con-stant revision of civic rights. 
 This is entrusted to the “courts”, meaning, of course, not those miserable parodies of courts which form the “institute” of rural superintendents 54 (or even the Justices of the Peace, who are elected by the propertiedclasses from among property holders), but those courts re-ferred to in §16 of the preceding section of our draft pro-gramme. 
 This §16 demands that “industrial courts be set up in all branches of the national economy...” (hence in agriculture as well) “... with equal representation of workers and employ-ers”. 
 Such composition of the courts would be a guarantee bothof their democratic nature and free expression of the differ-ent class interests of the various sections of the rural popula-tion. 
 Class antagonism would not be covered up with the fig-sion into “public property” of all kinds of land, except peasants ’ land , and allocations from a “national (land) fund” for “long-term leasesto the working peasantry ”. 
 In the first place, a Social-Democrat could not exclude peasant holdings from the general nationalisation of the land. 
 Secondly, he would advocate nationalisation of the land onlyas a transition to large-scale communist, and not small individual, farming. 
 Nadezhdin’s mistake is probably due to his decision to limit the programme to “demands which the muzhik understands (italics mine) and needs”. 
 53 leaf of rotten bureaucratism—that whited sepulchre for the remains of popular liberties—but would stand out openly and clearly to the general view, thereby rousing the country folk from their patriarchal slumber. 
 The election of judges fromamong the local inhabitants would guarantee their beingfamiliar with agrarian life in general and its local featuresin particular. 
 For the masses of the peasants, who could notcome under the heading of “workers” or “employers”, special rules would naturally be established to ensure equal repre-sentation of all elements of the rural population. 
 Moreover,we, Social-Democrats, would categorically insist under allcircumstances, first, on separate representation for the agri-cultural wage-workers, however few they may be, and, sec-ondly, that economically weak peasants and prosperous peasants should if possible be represented separately (for confusion of these two categories, not only results in falsestatistics, but leads to the oppression and constraint of theformer by the latter in all fields of life). 
 The competence of these courts would be twofold: firstly, they would be empowered to reduce rents where they are “exorbitant”. 
 This very wording in the programme recognises in oblique fashion how widespread this phenomenon is. 
 Thefact that the question of the level of rent would be exam-ined by courts in open session and with both parties repre-sented would be of enormous benefit, irrespective of whatthe court might decide. 
 Reductions of rent (even though these reductions might be infrequent) would play their part in removing the remnants of serf-ownership: it iswell known that in our countryside rent is more often of aserf-owning than a bourgeois nature; it is much more “mon-ey” rent (i. 
e. 
, a modified form of feudal rent) than capital-ist rent (i. 
e. 
, the surplus over and above the profit of the employer). 
 Reductions of rent would therefore directly help to replace serf-owning forms of farming by capitalist forms. 
 Secondly, the courts would be empowered “to declare null and void all contracts entailing bondage”. 
 The meaning of“bondage” is not defined here, since it would be wholly unde-sirable to hamper the elected judges in the application of this clause. 
 The Russian muzhik knows only too well what bondage is! From the scientific standpoint this concept cov-ers all contracts which entail elements of usury (winter hiring, etc. 
 ) or serfdom (labour rent for damage done by stray-ing cattle, etc. 
). 
 Clause 3, on the restitution of redemption payments to the people, is of a somewhat different nature. 
 Here the doubtsthat Clause 4 evokes on the score of small property do notarise. 
 On the other hand, the objectors point to both the prac-tical infeasibility of this demand and the absence of a logi-cal connection between this clause and the general section of our agrarian programme ( =“the eradication of the remnants of the serf-owning system and the free development of theclass struggle in the countryside”). 
 Nevertheless, no one willdeny that it is precisely the remnants of the serf-owning sys-tem that in their aggregate are the cause of the constant fam-ines which affect millions of peasants and at once set Rus-sia apart from all civilised nations. 
 Even the autocracy has therefore been obliged more and more frequently to institutea special fund (utterly trifling, of course, and going more toline the pockets of embezzlers of state property and bureau-crats than for the relief of the famine-stricken) “for the cultur-al and charitable needs of the village communes”. 
 We, too, cannot but demand, among other democratic reforms, that such a fund be established. 
 That can scarcely be disputed. 
 The question now arises, from what source should the sum required for this fund be obtained? So far as we can judge, aprogressive income-tax might be suggested to us: the ratesof taxation on the incomes of the rich should be raised for the purpose, and the sums obtained thereby used for this fund. 
 It would be only fair for the country’s wealthiestcitizens to contribute most for the maintenance of the fam-ine-stricken and for expenditures on the greatest possiblealleviation of calamities caused by famines. 
 We would havenothing against such a measure either, which need not be specially mentioned in the programme since it is fully cov-ered by the demand for a progressive income-tax, which isa separate item in the programme. 
 But why confine oneselfto this source? Why not try, in addition, to return to thepeople at least part of the tribute which yesterday’s slave-owners extracted, and are still extracting, from the peasants with the assistance of the police state? Is not this tribute most closely bound up with the present-day famines? And would not the demand to return this tribute render us the greatest service in spreading and intensifying the revolution-ary indignation of the peasants against all feudal landlords and against bondage of every kind? But, then—the objection is raised—this tribute cannot b e returned in full. 
 Quite so (just as the cut-off lands cannot berestituted in full). 
 But if one cannot get the whole debt back,why not take part of it? What objection can there be to aspecial land-tax on the big landed nobility who received land redemption loans? The number of such owners of latifundia (which occasionally even become entailed estates) is quiteconsiderable in Russia, and it would be only fair to makethem bear a special responsibility for famines among the peas-antry. 
 It will be even fairer to confiscate in full monasterialproperty and royal demesnes, as property most thoroughly steeped in traditions of serf-ownership and serving to enrich the most reactionary and socially most harmful drones, andat the same time to withdraw no small amount of land fromcivil and commercial circulation. 
 Confiscation of suchestates would therefore be wholly in the interests of all socialdevelopment *; it would be precisely the sort of partial bour-geois nationalisation of the land that could under no circum-stances lead to the hocus-pocus of “state socialism”. 
 It wouldbe of direct and enormous political importance in strengthen-ing the democratic institutions of the new Russia; and at the same time it would also provide additional funds for faminerelief. 
 IX Finally, as to the first two clauses of our agrarian pro-gramme, there is no need to dwell on them at length. 
 “Aboli-tion of land redemption and quit-rent payments, as well as of all services now imposed on the peasantry as a taxable social-estate” (Clause 1) is something that is self-evident to everySocial-Democrat. 
 Moreover, no doubts arise as to the practi-cal feasibility of this measure, so far as we can judge. 
 Thesecond clause demands “annulment of collective liability and *With regard to the leasing of these confiscated estates, the Social-Democrats should by no means pursue a specifically peasantpolicy, but should at once pursue the policy outlined by us above inour objections to Nadezhdin. 
 of all laws restricting the peasant...” (note: “peasant” and not “peasants”) “... in the free disposal of his land”. 
 Here we must say a few words about the much-vaunted and memorable “village commune ”. 
 Actually, of course, the annulment of col-lective liability (Mr. 
 Witte may manage to put this partic-ular reform through before the revolution), the abolition ofdivision into social-estates, freedom of movement, and theright for each individual peasant freely to dispose of his land will rapidly and inevitably bring about the removal of the burden of taxation and serf-bondage that the land communeto a three-fourths extent constitutes at the present time. 
But this result will only prove the correctness of our views onthe village commune, prove how incompatible it is with theentire social and economic development of capitalism. 
 The result will by no means follow from any particular measure recommended by us “against the village commune”, for wenever have supported and never shall support a single measure aimed directly against this or that system of peasant landtenure. 
 Moreover, we shall unreservedly defend the villagecommune as a democratic organisation of local government, as a co-operative or a neighbours’ association, against all en-croachments on the part of the bureaucrats—encroachmentswhich find such favour with opponents of the village communein the camp of Moskovskiye Vedomosti . 
 55 We shall never help any one to “destroy the village commune”, but we shall striveabsolutely for the abolition of all institutions that run coun-ter to democracy, irrespective of the effect of this abolition on the basic or partial reallotment of the land , etc. 
; that is where we differ fundamentally from the Narodniks—overt and cov-ert, consistent and inconsistent, timid and bold—who, onthe one hand, are “of course” democrats, and on the other,fear to resolutely and unequivocally define their attitude towards such elementary democratic demands as full freedom of movement, complete abolition of the social-estate nature of the peasant commune, and, consequently , utter annulment of collective liability, and abolition ofall laws restricting the peasant in the free disposal of hisland. 
 * *This is the touchstone we should apply to the numerous radicals in Russia (and even revolutionaries, of Vestnik Russkoi Revolutsii ) who in this question are inclined to sit between two stools. 
 The objection may be raised that, by sanctifying the indi-vidual will of each particular peasant, the latter measure will destroy the village commune, not only as a system of land reallotment, etc. 
, but outright, even as a co-operativeneighbours’ association. 
 Each individual peasant will havethe right to demand, despite the will of the majority, thathis land be allotted to him as a separate plot. 
 Does this notrun counter to the general tendency of all socialists to fur-ther the extension rather than the restriction of the right of the collective body over the individual? To this we reply that it does not at all follow from our for-mulation that every peasant must necessarily demand that aseparate plot of land be allotted to him. 
 What does followis only liberty to sell the land; moreover, the preferential right of the commune members to purchase land that is being sold does not run counter to this liberty. 
The annulment of collective liability would turn allmembers of the peasant commune into free co-owners of acertain plot of land; as to what else they will then make ofthis plot, that is their business and will depend on common civil law and on whatever special agreements they enter into among themselves. 
 With regard to extending the right ofthe collective body over the individual, such extension isupheld by the socialists only when it is in the interests oftechnical and social progress. 
 * In this form, naturally, we too would uphold any appropriate law if only it referred not just to the small property-owners alone, or just to the peasants alone, but in general to all those who own land. 
 X In conclusion, let us sum up the fundamental principles on which our agrarian programme is based. 
 Anyone who has had occasion to engage in drawing up programmes or enter *Kautsky, for instance, considers it correct to demand “the restriction of the rights of private property in land in the interestsof 1) demarcation of land holdings, abolishing strip-farming, 2) raisingstandards of agriculture, 3) preventing epidemics” ( Die Agrarfrage , S. 
 437). 
 Demands of this sort, which are fully justified, are not andshould not be connected in any way with the peasant commune. 
 into the details of their drafting in other countries knows that one and the same thought can be formulated in the most diverse ways. 
 What we hold important is that all the comrades to whom we are now submitting our draft for considerationshould reach common ground, first and foremost, on thefundamental principles. 
 Then this or that specific featurein the formulation will not be of decisive importance. 
 We hold that the class struggle is the main factor also in the sphere of agrarian relationships in Russia. 
 We base our entire agrarian policy (and, consequently, our agrarian pro-gramme as well) on unswerving recognition of this fact alongwith all consequences resulting from it. 
 Our principal imme-diate aim is to clear the way for the free development of theclass struggle in the countryside, the class struggle of the proletariat, which is directed towards attainment of the ultimate aim of the international Social-Democratic move-ment, the conquest of political power by the proletariat, andthe laying of the foundations of a socialist society. 
 Bydeclaring the class struggle our guiding line in all “agrarianquestions”, we resolutely and for all time dissociate ourselves from adherents, so numerous in Russia, of half-hearted and nebulous theories, such as “Narodnik”, “ethico-sociological”,“critical”, social-reformist, and whatever else they may becalled! To clear the way for the free development of the class strug-gle in the countryside, it is necessary to remove all remnants of serfdom, which now overlie the beginnings of capitalist antagonisms among the rural population, and keep them fromdeveloping. 
 And we are making a final attempt to help the peasantry sweep away all these remnants at a single decisiveblow—“final” because developing Russian capitalism isitself spontaneously doing the very same work, is making for the very same goal, but making for it along its own peculiar road of violence and oppression, ruin and starvation. 
 Thetransition from exploitation by the serf-owners to capitalistexploitation is inevitable, and it would be a harmful andreactionary illusion to attempt to hold it back or to “get round”it. 
 But this transition is also conceivable in the form of the forcible overthrow of those heirs of the serf-owners who, relying on the tradition of the former power of the slaveowner,rather than on the “power of money”, are sucking the last drops of blood from the patriarchal peasantry. 
 This patri-archal peasantry, which lives under a system of natural econ-omy by the labour of its hands, is doomed to disappear, but there is no “necessity” or any “immanent” law of social andeconomic evolution that dooms it to endure the torment ofbeing “ground down by taxes”, of floggings, or a long-drawnout, horribly protracted death by starvation. 
 And so, without harbouring any illusions about it being possible for the small producers to thrive or even to lead a tolerable existence in a capitalist society (such as Russia isbecoming to a greater and greater extent), we demand thecomplete and unconditional revolutionary and not refor-mative annulment and eradication of the survivals of serf-ownership; we hold that the lands which the government of the nobility cut off from the peasantry and which to this day still serve to keep the peasants in virtual bondage are peas-ants’ lands. 
 Thus, we take our stand—by way of exception andby reason of the specific historical circumstances—as defend-ers of small property; but we defend it only in its struggleagainst what has come down from the “old order”, and only on condition that those institutions be abolished which retard the transformation of the patriarchal Oblomov villages, 56 frozen in their immobility, backwardness, and neglect, on con-dition of the establishment of complete freedom of movement,freedom to dispose of land, and the complete abolition ofdivision into social-estates. 
 We want to supplement demo-cratic revision of the state and civil laws of Russia with dem-ocratic, revolutionary revision of the notorious “PeasantReform”. 
 Guided by these principles of agrarian policy, any Russian Social-Democrat who finds himself in the countryside willbe able to see his way in the intricate maze of relationships there, and will be able to “adapt” his strictly consistent rev-olutionary propaganda and agitation to these relationships. 
He will not be caught napping by a possible movement inthe peasantry (which already seems to have started here andthere). 
 He will not then limit himself to those demands onbehalf of wage-workers in agriculture which are set forth in detail in the section on the immediate “working-class” demands of our programme, and which, of course, he will advance every-where and at all times. 
 Among the peasantry too he will be able to give an impulse to the genera] democratic movement which (if it is destined to pass beyond the embryonic stage in our countryside) will begin with the struggle against the former serf-owners in the countryside, and end in an uprisingagainst that most formidable and foul remnant of the serf-owning system known as the tsarist autocracy.

 S. 
 This article was written before the outbreak of the peasant uprisings in the south of Russia in the spring of thisyear. 
 57 These events have fully confirmed the principles set forth in this article. 
 As to the tactical tasks which are nowpresenting themselves more forcibly than ever to our Party in its “rural” work, we hope to deal with them next time. 
 A LETTER TO THE ZEMSTVOISTS We quote in full a hectographed letter addressed to Zem-stvoists, which passed from hand to hand during the latestsession of the Zemstvo Assemblies (it has regrettably onlyjust come into our possession): “Dear Sir, “The grave situation in which Russia, the Russian people, and the Russian Zemstvo find themselves today has prompted us to address this letter to you, dear Sir, on the assumption that the ideas andintentions herein expressed will meet with your sympathy. 
 “The long series of sad and distressing facts of which we have in recent times been silent witnesses weighs like a dark cloud on thepublic conscience, and every person of education is faced squarely with the fateful question: is it possible to persist in abstaining from political action and by remaining passive contribute to the growingimpoverishment and corruption of our native land? “The chronic crop failures and the intolerable burden of taxation in the form of land redemption payments, non-assessable taxes haveliterally ruined the people, leading to its physical degeneration. 
 “The virtual denial to the peasantry of even the faintest semblance of self-government, the petty tutelage of official and self-appointedrepresentatives of ‘firm government’, and the artificial state of mentalstarvation in which the people is kept by the uninvited guardians of‘the foundations of Russian tradition and law’ are sapping its spiritualpowers, its initiative and energy. 
 “The productive forces of the country are being brazenly plundered by men of business in this country and abroad, with the gracious con-nivance of adventurers who are gambling with the destinies of ourcountry. 
 In vain is the ‘beneficent government’ trying to have a seriesof contradictory and hastily concocted measures take the place of aspirited and systematic struggle carried on by economic groups in the country. 
 Official ‘patronage’ and ‘concern’ are impotent in lace of the evil forerunners of Russia’s economic and financial bankruptcy:agrarian, industrial, and financial crises—the brilliant results of thepolicy of chance and gambling. 
 The press is stifled and deprived of anypossibility to shed light on at least part of the crimes that are hourlycommitted by the upholders of law and order, against the freedom and honour of Russian citizens. 
 Despotism, senseless and cruel, alone raises its voice authoritatively and reigns over the boundless expanses of our ravaged, humiliated, and outraged native land, nowhere meeting with a fitting rebuff. 
 “With such a state of affairs, the government’s systematic mistrust for the slightest manifestation of private or public initiative, the activities of any kind of public associations, and in particular the Zemstvo institutions—which the Russia of the sixties had hoped would prove the corner-stone of a new realm—is quite natural. 
 The triumph-ant bureaucracy has condemned the Zemstvo institutions to a lingering death, and every year deals a new blow at their activities, their sig-nificance and authority in the eyes of society and the people, who scarcely distinguish between the Zemstvo and the bureaucratic admin-istration. 
 The Zemstvo Assemblies have been converted into bureau-cratic social-estate councils, despite the clearly expressed protest of all progressive groups in the country, and have lost all connection with the mass of the Russian people. 
 The Zemstvo Boards are becoming annexes to the gubernatorial offices, and, losing in independence, are gradually acquiring all the defects of a government office. 
 The Zemstvo election meetings have been reduced to a veritable farce. 
 The paucity of voters and their division into social-estate groups, while depriving such meetings of the opportunity to serve as a means for the expression, in the persons of the elected councillors, of the various public interests, turn them into a battleground of petty and personal ambitions. 
 “The range of Zemstvo activities is gradually but steadily being restricted. 
 The Zemstvo has been deprived of jurisdiction in the matter of food supplies. 
 In the matter of assessments the Zemstvo has become the executor of the orders of government officials. 
 In the sphere of public education the role of the Zemstvo has been reduced to prac-tically nil. 
 The Medical Regulations drawn up by the Goremykin Ministry, while not abrogated formally, hang over the Zemstvo medical service like the Sword of Damocles. 
 The dark shadow cast by the government’s instructions to the school boards has to all appearances been dissipated. 
 But the Zemstvo is in no way guaranteed against a reappearance of this shadow, this time, however, embodied in the form of a law which would finally destroy the Zemstvo general schools. 
 Contacts between the Zemstvo institutions of the various gubernias, the need for which has become proverbial are confronted with new difficulties in the latest Circular of the Ministry of the Interior on this subject. 
 Every step of the Zemstvo as a public institution comes up against an intricate cobweb of numerous circulars from the various min-isters, and the Zemstvoist is obliged to spend no little time, energy and wit on the thankless task of untangling this web, if he wants to give effect to this or that measure. 
 The notorious Article 87 of the Zemstvo Statutes, and particularly its Clause 2, places the whole of Zemstvo activities under the Governor’s supervision. 
 Gubernatorial investigations of Zemstvo Boards are becoming ever more frequent; through the permanent members of the Gubernia Board for Zemstvo Affairs, the government is unceremoniously placing the Zemstvo under open surveillance. 
 By enacting a law limiting the right of the Zemstvo to levy taxes, the government openly admits its extreme mistrust of the fundamental right of the Zemstvo—the right to impose local taxes. 
 Owing to the interference of the Police Department, the best Zemstvo officials, both elected and employed, are forcibly torn away from Zemstvo activities. 
 In the near future, the ministerial projects of control of the Zemstvo’s financial operations to be exercised by officials of the State Control Board and of the regulation of the activity of the Zemstvo Advisory Commissions will probably be made law. 
 “Not only are Zemstvo petitions being turned down, but they are not even given consideration in accordance with the procedure estab-lished for such cases and are casually rejected by the ministers on their own authority. 
 Under such conditions, it has become impossible to work in the Zemstvo with an earnest belief in the fruitfulness of that work. 
 And we are now witnessing a process of constantly increasing impoverishment of the Zemstvo forces and in particular of the Zemstvo executive bodies—the Boards. 
 People who are ardently devoted to the Zemstvo cause are leaving the Zemstvo, having lost faith in the efficacy of the work under the present conditions. 
 And their places are being taken by Zemstvoists of a new type, by opportunists who tremble in cowardly fashion for the good name, the outward form of the Zem-stvo institutions, and who disgrace the latter by crawling and grovel-ling to the administration. 
 The result is an internal corruption of the Zemstvo that is far worse than a formal abolition of self-government. 
 The government’s open campaign against the Zemstvo idea itself might lead to widespread public indignation, which the bureaucrats fear so greatly. 
 But before our very eyes a camouflaged destruction of the principle of self-government is taking place and, unfortunately, is not meeting with organised resistance. 
 “With such a state of affairs, the comparative insignificance of the material results of Zemstvo activities is by no means compensated by its educational significance, and the almost forty years of work on the part of the Zemstvo institutions directed towards developing civic spirit, social consciousness, and initiative may be lost without a trace for the immediate future. 
 From this standpoint, the meek and humble marking of time by the opportunist Zemstvoists only facilitates the inglorious and futile death of the great idea of the Zemstvo institutions. 
 The only possible way to lead the Zemstvos out of the impasse into which they have been led by the system of tutelage is to fight energet-ically against the absurd idea that a consideration of questions going beyond the bounds of the minor details of local life is fraught with national disaster. 
 This bugbear, which, of course, threatens no danger to the people or the security of the state, this idea, the absurdity of which is cynically acknowledged by its supporters (see Witte’s con-fidential memorandum, ‘The Autocracy and the Zemstvo’), must be combated by the Zemstvo through open and bold consideration in the Zemstvo Assemblies of questions of national importance which are closely bound up with the needs and interests of the local popula-tion. 
 And the more comprehensively, the more fully and energetically the Zemstvo Assemblies consider questions of this kind, the more clearly will it be disclosed that public consideration of evils affecting contrary, averts it, that the muzzle which has at present been placed on the press is of benefit only to the enemies of the people, that police rule over word and thought cannot create honest citizens, and that law and freedom are not incompatible with each other. 
 Public discus-sion of all such questions in several Gubernia Zemstvo Assemblies simultaneously will undoubtedly meet with the greatest sympathy on the part of all sections of the people and rouse the public conscienceto energetic activity. 
 If, however, the Zemstvo fails to react in any way to the present critical condition of Russia, then of course Messrs. 
 the Sipyagins and Wittes, after having deprived the Zemstvo of itsrole of representative of the interests of labour, will not hesitate to bring it into final ‘conformity’ with the general structure of the insti-tutions of the Empire. 
 What forms this ‘conformity’ will take, we,who know the shrewdness and resourcefulness of the country’s present rulers, are decidedly at a loss to imagine. 
 After all, the Minister of the Interior had sufficient effrontery, and displayed amazing contemptfor the ‘pre-eminent’ social-estate of the Empire in investing its chosen representatives—the Marshals of the Nobility—with the de-spicable role of spies, whose duty was to keep the lecturers and thecontent of popular lectures under surveillance. 
 “For the reasons outlined above, we are of the opinion that our inactivity and further meek resignation to all the experiments towhich the bureaucracy is subjecting the Zemstvo and all Russia constitute, not only a form of suicide, but a grave crime against our native land. 
 How groundless, how insensate are the tactics of oppor-tunism—the sale of one’s ‘birthright’ for a ‘mess of pottage’—has been shown us sufficiently clearly by life: the autocratic bureaucracy, having first appropriated our birthright, has now also taken awayfrom us the ‘mess of pottage’. 
 Step by step we have been deprived of almost all our civic rights; the forty years that have elapsed since the inception of the ‘great reforms’ have brought us back to the samepoint from which we departed forty years ago when we embarked on those reforms. 
 Have we much to lose now? how can we justify con-tinued silence on our part? how can it be explained except by shamefulcowardice and an utter lack of all sense of civic duty? “As Russian citizens, and moreover Russian citizens in ‘high positions’, we are in duty bound to defend the rights of the Russianpeople, in duty bound to give a fitting reply to the autocratic bureau-cracy which is striving to crush the slightest manifestation of liberty and independence in public life and to make abject slaves of the wholeRussian people. 
 As Zemstvoists, we are especially obliged to uphold the rights of the Zemstvo institutions, defend them against the arbi-trariness and despotism of the bureaucracy, and uphold their rightto independence and the satisfaction in the broadest way of the needs of all sections of the people. 
 “Let us then cease to be silent in the manner of school children guilty of some misdemeanour; let us at last show that we are adult citizens and let us demand what is our due—the claim to our ‘birth-right’, our civic rights. 
 “The autocratic bureaucracy never grants anything voluntarily a show of ceding its ‘rights’ solely out of magnanimity. 
 If it happens to grant more than it was compelled to, it immediately withdraws all superfluous concessions, as was the case with our ‘great reforms’. 
 The government showed no concern for the workers until it was facedwith a serious ‘labour movement’ in the form of demonstrations of many thousands of workers; it thereupon hastened to enact ‘labour legislation’, which, although sufficiently hypocritical, was neverthe-less designed to meet at least some of the demands of the workers and to pacify these formidable masses. 
 For decades the government crip-pled our students, our sisters, brothers and children, by forbiddingthe slightest criticism of the ‘educational system’ it had devised, and savagely suppressing student ‘disorders’. 
 “But no sooner had these ‘disorders’ turned into a mass strike, than the academic machine came to a standstill, and the bureaucracy was suddenly imbued with an ardent feeling of ‘cordial concern’ for the student youth; and those very demands to which onlyyesterday the sole reply was the crack of Cossack whips are today proclaimed a government programme for the ‘reform of educa-tion’. 
 “Of course, there is no small dose of hypocrisy in this metamorpho-sis too, and yet.... 
 Yet there can be no doubt of the fact that the ‘bu-reaucracy’ has been compelled openly to recognise and make a fairlysubstantial concession to public opinion. 
 And we, like the whole of Russian society, like the whole of the Russian people, can count on the recognition and realisation of our rights only if weboldly, openly, concertedly, and persistently demand these rights. 
 “In view of all these considerations, we have decided to address the present letter to you, dear Sir, and to many other members of the gubernia Zemstvos, with the appeal to help the present session of Gubernia Zemstvo Assemblies raise, discuss, and adopt correspondingdecisions on the following questions: “1. 
 Reconsideration of the Statutes on Zemstvo Institutions and their amendment along the following lines: “a) the granting of equal suffrage to all groups of the population, without distinction of social-estates, and with a considerable lowering of the property qualification; b) the removal from the Zemstvo ofmembers representing social-estates as such; c) the Zemstvo to be freed in all its activities from the tutelage of the administration, and to be granted complete independence in all local affairs, on conditionthat it submits to the laws of the country on the same basis as all other persons and institutions; d) the jurisdiction of the Zemstvo to be extended by granting it complete independence in attendingto all local interests and requirements insofar as they do not infringe on general state interests; e) the repeal of the law limiting the right of the Zemstvo to levy taxes; f) the Zemstvo to be granted the broadestrights in the matter of spreading public education in every possible way; moreover, the Zemstvo to be granted the right to supervise and improve the educational as well as the economic aspect of this matter;g) the abrogation of the above-mentioned Medical Regulations, which put back into the hands of the Zemstvo, the latter also to be granted complete independence in the organisation and conduct of its statis-tical and assessment work; i) all Zemstvo business to be conducted exclusively by elected Zemstvo people, who shall not be subject toendorsement by the administration, still less be appointed against the will of the Zemstvo Assemblies; j) the Zemstvo to be granted the right to employ people exclusively at their own discretion withoutendorsement by the administration; k) the Zemstvo to be granted the right freely to discuss all questions affecting the state as a whole if they bear on local interests and requirements, in addition to whichall petitions of the Zemstvo shall be considered without fail by higher government institutions within a definitely designated period of time; l) all Zemstvos to be granted the right to communicate with oneanother as well as to arrange congresses of Zemstvo representatives to consider questions concerning all or several Zemstvos. 
 “II. 
 Reconsideration and amendment of the Statutes on the Peas-antry with a view to granting them complete equality of rights with the other social-estates. 
 “III. 
 R evision of the taxation system with a view to equalising the burden of taxation through progressive taxes on income derived from property, and provided that certain minimum incomes be exempt-ed from taxation. 
 “It is likewise highly desirable that the following points be raised and considered in the Zemstvo Assemblies: “IV. 
 The re-establishment everywhere of courts conducted by Justices of the Peace, as well as the repeal of all laws restricting the competence of trial by jury. 
 “V. 
 The granting of greater freedom of the press; the necessity of abolishing preliminary censorship; the revision of the censorship regulations so as to indicate definitely and explicitly what may and what may not be published; the prohibition of arbitrary action bythe administrative authorities in censorship matters, and the trying of all cases of press law violations exclusively in open session of the general courts. 
 “VI. 
 R evision of existing laws and ministerial edicts concerning measures to protect the security of the state; the elimination, in this sphere, of secret ‘judgement’ by the administrative authoriti-es, and open trial of all cases of this kind by general court pro-cedure. 
 “Trusting that you will not refuse to assist in raising in your Guber-nia Zemstvo Assembly the general questions herein indicated, we have the honour to request you to inform all Zemstvos as far as possible, through councillors whom you know personally or who are known toyou, of any eventual decision of the Zemstvo Assembly. 
 We likewise hope that in most Zemstvos there will be a sufficient number of bold and enterprising people who will succeed in getting the ZemstvoAssemblies to adopt these demands. 
 If we all present our just demands concertedly, openly, and unequivocally, the bureaucracy will be compelled to yield, as it always does when it encounters a ralliedand enlightened force. 
 Old Zemstvoists This is a very instructive letter, which shows how life itself is forcing even people who are little capable of struggle and who are most of all absorbed in practical routine to act against the autocratic government. 
 And if this letter is compared, for instance, with such writings as Mr. 
 R. 
N. 
S. 
’s foreword to the Witte Memorandum,58 the former, in my opinion, makes the better impression. 
 True, there are no “broad” political generalisations in the letter—but then its authors are not making “program-matic” declarations, but giving modest advice as to how to begin agitation in practice . 
 They have not indulged in “flights of fancy” to the extent of speaking directly about political liberty, but then neither have they indulged in phrase-mongering about persons close to the throne who could possibly influence the tsar. 
 Nor do they falsely extol the “acts” of Alexander II, but, on the contrary, there is derision of the “great reforms” (in quotation marks). 
 They find in themselves the frankness and courage to rise reso-lutely against the “Zemstvo opportunists”, without fear of declaring war on the “shameful cowardice”, and without currying favour with the particularly backward liberals. 
 We do not yet know what success has attended the appeal of the old Zemstvoists, but at any rate we think that their initiative deserves full support. 
 The recent revival of the Zemstvo movement is in general an extremely interesting phenomenon. 
 The authors of the letter them-selves mention how the movement has spread: started by the workers, it has extended to the students and is now being taken up by Zemstvoists. 
 All these three social elements are thus arranging themselves in proper succession in accor-dance with the diminishing order of their numerical strength, public alertness, social and political radicalism, and revolutionary determination. 
 So much the worse for our enemy. 
 The less revolution-ary the elements that rise up against him, the better it is for us, unreserved opponents of the autocracy and of the existing economic system as a whole. 
 Let us convey our greetings to the new protesters and, consequently, to our new allies. 
 Let us help them. 
 You can see that they are poor; they can only put out of the workers and students. 
 We are rich. 
 We shall publish it in printed form. 
 We shall give publicity to this new slap in the face to the Obmanov tsars. 
 This slap in the face is all the more remarkable, the more “respectable”the people are who deal it. 
 You can see that they are weak; they have so little con-tact with the people that their letter passes from handto hand as if it were actually a copy of a private letter. 
 We are strong. 
 We can and must circulate this letter “among the people”, and primarily among the proletariat, whichis prepared for and has already commenced the strugglefor the freedom of the whole people. 
 You can see that they are timid; they are only just beginning to extend the scope of their pure Zemstvo agita-tion. 
 We are bolder than they are; our workers have already gone through the “stage” (a stage that was forced on them)of economic agitation alone. 
 Let us set them an exampleof how to fight. 
 For if the workers fought for a demandlike the annulment of the “Provisional Rules”, in orderto voice a protest against the autocracy, then the violation by the administration of even the faintest trace of what is nonetheless “ self-government ” may constitute no less important ground! But here we are stopped short by all sorts of supporters of “economism”, overt and covert, conscious and unconscious. 
Who needs this support of the Zemstvoists by the workers? they ask us. 
 Is it not the Zemstvoists alone? Is it not people who are perhaps dissatisfied only because the governmentfavours the industrial capitalists more than the agricul-tural? Is it not the bourgeoisie alone, whose desires gono further than “the spirited struggle of the economicgroups of the country”? Who needs it? Well, first of all, and more than all, the working class itself . 
 This “only really revolutionary class” of present-day society would not be a revolutionary class in-deed, if it did not take advantage of every occasion for dealing a new blow at its bitterest enemy. 
 And the wordsabout political agitation and political struggle in our state-ments and programmes would be hollow sounds if we let slip the favourable opportunities for struggle that presentthemselves when even former allies of this enemy (the men of the sixties) and in part also his present allies (the opportunist Zemstvoists and feudal-minded landlords) are beginning to quarrel with him. 
 Let us then carefully follow Zemstvo developments, the rise and spread (or fall and ebb) of the new wave ofprotests. 
 Let us try to acquaint the working class morefully with the history of the Zemstvo, with the government’sconcessions to society in the sixties, with the lying speeches of the tsars and their tactics: first to grant a “mess of pot-tage” instead of the “birthright”—and then (on the basisof this retention of the “birthright”) to take away themess of pottage itself. 
 Let the workers learn to see throughthese old police tactics in all their manifestations. 
 Suchdiscernment is also indispensable in our struggle for our “birthright”, for the freedom of the proletariat to wage a struggle against all economic and social oppression. 
 Let us tell the workers in the study circles about the Zem-stvo and its attitude to the government; let us issue leafletson the Zemstvo protests; let us work in such a way thatto every insult the tsarist government offers to any Zemstvo that is at all honest the proletariat will be able to reply with demonstrations against the high-handed governors,the bashi-bazouk gendarmes, and the Jesuit censors. 
 Theparty of the proletariat must learn to denounce and stig-matise every servant of the autocracy for every outrage and violence directed against any section of society, any nation or race.

 You ask what the Borba group is. 
 We know that several of its members have contributed to Zarya (two articles) and Iskra (3 reports, 2 articles and 1 commentary). 
 Several articles they sent us were not published. 
 They have now published a printed “declaration”, complaining of our “undemocratic” attitude and campaigning even ...against a Personencultus *! As a man of experience you will grasp what is at the bottom of it all from this one unparal-leled and peerless word. 
 And when Borba publishes its ar-ticle against Where to Begin? about the rejection of which they also speak in the declaration—then even comrades who are absolutely inexperienced in Party affairs will under-stand why we did not receive these contributors with openarms.

 (Comments on the Programme of the N. 
L. 
) First of all, it is necessary to note the principal de-fect of the “programme” in respect of form , namely, that it lumps together the fundamental principles of scientific socialism with the narrow, concrete tasks, not only of aparticular moment, but even of a particular locality. 
 Thisdefect becomes at once apparent even from a glance atthe contents of the fifteen paragraphs of the programme. 
Let us do that. 
 § 1—aim of the working-class movement in general. 
 § 2—the principal condition for achieving this aim. 
§ 3—immediate political task of Russian Social-Democ-racy. 
 § 4—attitude of Russian Social-Democracy to the liber-als, etc. 
 § 5—ditto. 
 § 6—the concepts of “class” and “party” (a particular differ-ence of opinion with the “economists”). 
 § 7—practical tasks of agitation. 
§ 8—significance of propaganda. 
§ 9—demonstrations and manifestations. 
 § 10—May Day celebrations. 
 § 11—leaflets and demonstrations on February 19. 
 60 § 12—economic struggle and social reforms. 
§ 13—the necessity of an offensive as well as of a de-fensive struggle of the working class. 
 § 14—active, not merely passive, role in strikes. 
 § 15—strikes as the best means of struggle. 
 It will easily be seen that these paragraphs, which deal with such varied matters, should have been divided up into separate sections (otherwise it may give rise to con-siderable misunderstandings among people unable to distin-guish between fundamental principles and the practical tasks of the moment). 
 It is not only inept but even utterlyincorrect and ambiguous to place side by side a statementof the ultimate aim of socialism and a discussion withthe “economists”, or a definition of the importance of strikes. 
What the Northern League should have done was first to make a clear statement of principle with regard to its convictions in general, then to define the political tasks ofthe Party as the Northern League understands them, and,thirdly, to separate from these strictly programmatic thesesthe resolutions of the organisation (the Northern League) on the problems of the practical movement (§ §7-11 and 13-15). 
 A separate point should have been made of §6, which defines the attitude of the Northern League to the differ-ences of opinion among Russian Social-Democrats, while §12should have been included in the statement of principle(since the relation of the current struggle for petty improve-ments and reforms to the struggle for the ultimate aim is a general and not a specifically Russian question). 
 After this general remark, I shall now proceed to ana-lyse the individual paragraphs: § 1 outlines the general aims of Social-Democracy as a whole. 
 These aims are stated extremely briefly and disjoint-edly. 
 True, the programme of a local organisation ought not to go into details, which are indispensable for the programme of a party. 
 Fully realising this and considering that it wasa very useful and important decision on the part of theNorthern League not to keep silent about the fundamentalprinciples of Social-Democracy even in a programme of a localorganisation, I would in that case deem it necessary only to add a statement outlining the fundamental principles in greater detail. 
 In other words, it should have been indicated,for instance, that the Northern League bases itself on inter-national scientific socialism (the international character of the movement is not indicated anywhere in the programme),and subscribes to the theory of “revolutionary Marxism”. 
 In addition to this general statement of its principles, it would be possible to add a proposition like § 1, but byitself it (§1) is not sufficient. 
 As an organisation affiliated to the Russian Social-Dem-ocratic Labour Party, the Northern League should have declared its solidarity with the “Manifesto” of this Party; moreover, it would have been also useful to point to thesolidarity of the Northern League at least with the draftprogramme of the Russian Social-Democrats prepared in theeighties by the Emancipation of Labour group. 
 Such a state-ment, while leaving open the question of the modifications this draft requires, would more accurately define the North-ern League’s stand in matters of principle. 
 Here is thealternative: either you must yourselves draw up a complete account of all the fundamental principles of Social-Democ-racy (i. 
e. 
, draw up the theoretical section of the Social-Democratic programme yourselves), or you must declare quite definitely that the Northern League subscribes to more or less well-known and established principles. 
 The thirdway, the one chosen by the programme—to indicate theultimate aim in an utterly disjointed manner—will not do. 
 § 2 begins with an extremely inaccurate, ambiguous, and dangerous statement: “considering socialism to be the class interest of the proletariat”. 
 These words identify, as it were, socialism with the “class interest of the pro-letariat”. 
 And this identification is absolutely incorrect . 
 Precisely at the present time, when an exceedingly narrow conception of the “class interests of the proletariat” hasbecome extremely widespread, it is quite impermissible to present a formulation which, if it can be somehow acceptable, will be accepted only if the expression “class interest” isunderstood in an extremely broad sense. 
 “Class interest” impels the proletarians to unite, to fight against the cap-italists, to think about the prerequisites of their eman-cipation. 
 “Class interest” makes them receptive to social-ism. 
 But socialism, as the ideology of the class struggle of the proletariat, is subject to the general conditionsgoverning the inception, development, and consolidationof an ideology; in other words, it is founded on the sum-total of human knowledge, presupposes a high level of scien-tific development, demands scientific work, etc. 
, etc. 
 Socialism is introduced by the ideologists into the proletar-ian class struggle, which develops spontaneously on thebasis of capitalist relationships. 
 The formulation of § 2, however, throws an altogether false light on the real rela-tion of socialism to the class struggle. 
 Moreover, §2 does not speak of the class struggle. 
 That is its second defect. 
 § 3 defines absolutism inadequately (for example, it does not point to its connection with remnants of the serf-owningsystem), in places bombastically (“boundless”) and vaguely(“ignoring” the individual ). 
 Further, the conquest of political liberty (it should have been noted that the Northern League sets this task to the whole Party ) is essen-tial, not only for the full development of the workers’ class struggle; in one way or another it should have been pointedout that it is also essential in the interests of all socialdevelopment. 
 “The autocracy represents the interests of the ruling classes exclusively. 
” This is inaccurate, or wrong. 
 The autoc-racy satisfies certain interests of the ruling classes, main-taining itself partly by the inertness of the mass of thepeasantry and the small producers in general, partly bybalancing between conflicting interests, and constituting,to a certain extent, an independent organised political force. 
 The wording of §3 is especially impermissible in view of the fact that the absurd identification of theRussian autocracy with the rule of the bourgeoisie isextremely widespread in our country. 
 “Incompatible with the principle of democracy. 
” What is the point of this when nothing has as yet been said about democracy? And does not the demand for the overthrow of the autocracy and the winning of political liberty ex-press precisely the “principle” of democracy? This phrasewill not do. 
 Instead it should have been pointed out moreprecisely how consistent and determined we are (in compari-son with the bourgeois democrats) in our understanding of the “principle of democracy”—for example, by describing in one way or another the idea and content of a “democratic constitution” or proclaiming our demand for a democratic republic as a matter of “principle”. 
 § 4 is especially unsatisfactory. 
 Instead of speaking about the “full” utilisation of “broad” liberty (as a matter of fact, this is just vague phrase-mongering, which could very well be replaced, and should be, by definite referenceto a democratic republic and a democratic constitution, for “full” utilisation means consistent democracy)— instead of this, it was imperative to state that it is not only the working class that is interested in political liberty. 
 Silence on this score is tantamount to opening the doorwide to the worst forms of “economism”, and to forgettingour general democratic tasks. 
 It is absolutely wrong to say that the realisation (?? attainment, conquest) of political liberty is “just as” nec-essary to the proletariat as higher wages and a shorter working day. 
 This is just what it is n o t , for this is a neces-sity of a different and f a r m o r e c o m p l e x order than the necessity for wage increases, etc. 
 The differencebetween the two “necessities” may also be clearly seen fromthe fact, for instance, that the autocracy is prepared to grant ( and actually does occasionally grant ) improved con-ditions to individual sections or groups of the workingclass if only these sections will make their peace with absolutism. 
 The sentence under analysis is absolutely imper-missible, reflecting as it does an incredible vulgarisationof “economic” materialism, and debasement of Social-Demo-cratic understanding to the level of sheer trade-union-ism. 
 Further. 
 “In view of this” ... should be deleted in view of what has been stated above ... “in the impending struggle”... (i. 
e. 
, evidently the struggle against tsarism?) ... “theSocial-Democrats should come forward with a definite class programme and demands.... 
” The class nature of our political programme and political demands is expressed precisely in the fact that they stand for complete andconsistent democracy. 
 If, however, one speaks about ourentire programme in general, and not only about politicaldemands, then its class nature should follow of itself from the very content of our programme. 
 There is no point in speaking of a “ definite ” class programme; you yourselves must define , expound, express and formulate this class programme explicitly and with precision. 
 “...Without subordination to the liberal programme.... 
” This is simply ludicrous. 
 We come forward as the fore-most democratic party, and suddenly make the reservation that we do “not subordinate”!! Like children who havejust been freed from “subordination”! Our “insubordination” to the liberals should be expressed, not in phrases about insubordination, but in the whole nature of our programme ( and, of course , of our activity ). 
 It is precisely that conception of political tasks whichidentifies (or at least equates) the necessity for libertywith the necessity for wage increases, that e x p r e s s e s subordination of Social-Democracy to the liberals. 
 The end of § 4 will not do either; it is criticised in all that has been said above. 
 § 5 reduces our general attitude towards all democracy in general to mere collaboration with other parties in practicalmatters. 
 That is too narrow. 
 If such parties exist, theyshould have been named concretely (not in the programme,but in a special resolution of the congress), and the attitude towards the Socialist-Revolutionaries, the Svoboda group, etc. 
, should have been explicitly defined. 
 If, however, it is a ques-tion, not of definite parties, but of the attitude towards otherrevolutionary ( and opposition ) trends in general, then the wording should have been expanded, in one way or anotherrepeating the thesis of the Communist Manifesto about our support of every revolutionary movement against the existing system. 
 61 § 6 is out of place in the programme. 
 It should have been transferred to a separate resolution and should have statedopenly that it deals with the differences of opinion (or two trends) within the Russian Social-Democratic movement. 
 This is more than “numerous misunderstandings”. 
 The formu-lation of the differences of opinion is too narrow, for theyare far from being limited to the confusion of class with party. 
 There should have been a corresponding statementcoming out resolutely and definitely against the “critics ofMarxism”, “economism”, and limitation of our political tasks. 
 As to the second part of § 6, since it is elucidated in other paragraphs (7, 14, and others), a criticism of it is givenin the comments on these paragraphs. 
 § 7, like all that follows (with the exception of § 12), should go into a separate resolution, but should not be adirect part of the programme . 
 § 7 formulates the “task” of the League’s activity in a limited way. 
 We must not only “develop the class-conscious-ness of the proletariat”, but also organise the latter into a political party—and then direct its struggle (both eco-nomic and political). 
 The statement that the proletariat finds itself in “def-inite, concrete conditions” is superfluous. 
 It should eitherbe omitted or these conditions should be defined (but this should be done elsewhere in the programme). 
 It is wrong to say that agitation is the “only” means of achieving our tasks. 
 It is far from being the only means. 
 It is inadequate to define agitation as “influence over broad sections of the workers”. 
 The nature of this influ-ence should be indicated. 
 It is necessary to speak aboutpolitical agitation more directly, resolutely, definitely and in greater detail: otherwise, by keeping silent aboutpolitical agitation as such and devoting two whole para-graphs (14 and 15) to economic agitation, the programme strays (unintentionally) into “economism”. 
 Special emphasisshould have been placed on the necessity for agitationabout all manifestations of political and economic, social and national oppression, irrespective of the class or section of the population affected by that oppression —the necessity (for Social-Democrats) to be in the forefront in all clashes with the government, and so on—and only then shouldthe means of agitation (oral agitation, newspapers, leaflets,manifestations, etc. 
, etc. 
) have been indicated. 
 § 8 begins with superfluous repetition. 
“Recognises propaganda only to the extent”, etc. 
 This is incorrect. 
 Propaganda does not only have this significance; it is not only a means of “training agitators”, but also ameans of spreading class-consciousness in general. 
 The pro-gramme goes to the other extreme. 
 If it was necessary tocome out against propaganda which some people divorcetoo much from the tasks of agitation, it would have been better to say: “in propaganda it is particularly necessary not to lose sight of the task of training agitators”, or some-thing to that effect. 
 But all propaganda should not be reduced to the training of “experienced and capable agita-tors”, and the “training of only individual class-consciousworkers” should not be simply “rejected”. 
 We consider this inadequate, but we do not “reject” it. 
 And the latter part of § 8 (from: “our attitude being one of rejection”) shouldtherefore be deleted altogether. 
 § 9. 
 I fully agree with this paragraph in essence. 
 Perhaps “in connection with the most varied events in public life and government measures...” should have been added. 
 Instead of “the best means”, it would be more accurate to say: “one of the best means”. 
 Only the end of this paragraph is unsatisfactory. 
 Demon-strations and manifestations unite, and should unite, not only the workers (moreover, to say “unites” through mani-festations is insufficient, since we also want to unite orga-nisationally, directly and for all time, and not only for oneparticular occasion). 
 “... Thereby developing in them.... 
” This is either inaccurate—class-consciousness cannot bedeveloped by manifestations alone —or superfluous (it has already been said that it is one of the best means). 
 It would be useful to add something about the need to organise manifestations, about their preparation, conduct, etc. 
 In general, the absence in the programme of any refer-ence to the necessity of devoting great attention to thematter of revolutionary organisation , in particular to setting up an all-Russia, militant organisation, is a great defi-ciency . 
 Once reference is made to agitation, propaganda, strikes, and the like, it is quite inexcusable to say nothingabout revolutionary organisation. 
 § 10. 
 It should have been added that in our country May Day must also become a demonstration against the autoc-racy , a demand for political liberty. 
 Pointing to the international significance of the holiday is not enough. 
It must also be linked up with the struggle for the mostvital national political demands. 
 § 11. 
 A very good idea, but expressed too restrictedly. 
 Perhaps the words “among other things” should have been inserted, since demonstrations should be organised on the anniversary of the Commune as well, and on many otheroccasions; or “in particular” should have been inserted orelse the impression may be created that demonstrations onother occasions are not necessary. 
 Further. 
 It is wrong to appeal on February 19 (in leaflets) only to the workers. 
 Apart from the fact that in general we always appeal to the entire people and even to the wholeworld in our demonstrations an in the leaflets issued in connection with them, on February 19 in particular appeals should be addressed also to the peasantry . 
 And if we are to appeal to the peasantry, that means we must draw up a Social-Democratic policy on the agrarian question. 
 Theprogramme does not touch on this question, and we quiteunderstand that a local organisation may perhaps lackthe time or the forces to deal with this. 
 Nevertheless, it shouldcertainly have at least been mentioned, in one way or another, in connection with one attempt or another to tackle it in Social-Democratic literature and in the prac-tical activities of our movement. 
 * The end of § 11 will not do (“only class force”—which class? The working class alone?). 
 Should have been deleted. 
 § 12. 
 We neither can nor will help “in every way” to improve the conditions of the workers under the present circumstances. 
 For instance, we cannot help in the Zuba-tov 62 fashion, and even if Zubatov corruption is involved we shall not do that. 
 We fight only for such improvementof the workers’ conditions as will raise their capacity to wage the class struggle, i. 
e. 
, when the improvement of condi-tions is not bound up with corruption of political conscious-ness, with police tutelage, with being tied down to agiven locality, with subjugation to a “benefactor”, witha lowering of human dignity, etc. 
, etc. 
 Precisely in Russia,where the autocracy is so much inclined (and is becomingmore and more inclined) to buy itself off from revolution with various hand-outs and sham reforms, it is our duty to draw a clear line of demarcation between ourselves andall sorts of “reformers”. 
 We also fight for reforms, but byno means “in every way”; we fight for reforms only in Social-Democratic fashion, only in a revolutionary way. 
 § 13 is omitted by decision of the congress. 
 And it should have been omitted. 
 § 14 formulates the content and the tasks of economic agitation in too narrow a way. 
 The latter is not confinedto strikes alone. 
 We need “better conditions”, not only forthe cultural development of the proletariat, but partic-ularly for its revolutionary development. 
 The “active *For instance, the attempts of the workers to stage demonstrations in connection with floggings of the peasants, etc. 
 role” of Social-Democrats in strikes does not end with encouraging the struggle for improvements in economic con-ditions . 
 Strikes (like economic agitation in general) should always be used to encourage the revolutionary struggle for freedom and for socialism as well. 
 Strikes should beused for political agitation also. 
 § 15 is also most unsatisfactory. 
 Strikes are not the “best” means of struggle, but only one of the means, and not always necessarily one of the best means. 
 We must recognise the importance of strikes, make use of them andlead them at all times—but it would be all the more dan-gerous to exaggerate their importance, the more this hasbeen done by the “economists”. 
 What is said further about strikes is redundant: it has already been stated in § 14. 
 A reference to leadership of the economic struggle in general would have been sufficient. 
This leadership may sometimes consist in deterring fromstrike action. 
 The programme expresses itself in too absolutea fashion, and for this very reason too restrictedly. 
 The pro-gramme should have spoken about the task in general, that of leading the economic struggle of the proletariat, of mak-ing it more organised and conscious, of organising workers’trade unions and endeavouring to develop them into all-Rus-sia organisations, of utilising every strike, every manifesta-tion of economic oppression, etc. 
, for the most widespreadsocialist and revolutionary propaganda and agitation. 
 The end of § 15 limits the tasks of this agitation, making the use of political agitation depend, as it were, on actionby the police, etc. 
 Actually, however, we must try to usepolitical agitation (and this is quite possible if the leadersare at all capable) before action by these “archangels”, and irrespective of that action. 
 It should have been formulated more generally: “to take advantage of all and every oppor-tunity for political agitation”, etc. 
 The end of § 15 is also incorrect. 
 It is the less fitting for us to speak of “general strikes”, the less opportunitywe in Russia have of preparing them. 
 And, in general, there is no reason for speaking specially about “general” strikes in programmes (remember the absurd “general strike” in the pamphlet Who Will Carry Out the Political Revolution? 63 After all, such misunderstandings are also possible). 
 To declare that strikes are “the best means of developing class-consciousness ” is also absolutely incorrect. 
 As a whole, a serious revision of the programme would be highly desirable. 
 In general it would also be desirablefor the Northern League to take an active part both inthe unification of revolutionary Social-Democracy in a party and in the preparation of the Party programme. 
 For their part, the editors of Zarya and Iskra hope soon to acquaint the Northern League with their draft (most of which is already completed), and trust that the NorthernLeague will co-operate in amending and circulating thisdraft and in preparing it for adoption by the entire Party.

 N. 
 Written in April 1902 First published in 1923 Published according to the manuscript WHY THE SOCIAL-DEMOCRATS MUST DECLARE A DETERMINED AND RELENTLESS WAR ON THE SOCIALIST-REVOLUTIONARIES 1) Because that trend in our social thought which goes by the name of “Socialist-Revolutionary” is in fact movingaway, and has indeed moved away, from the onlyinternational theory of revolutionary socialism existing today, i. 
e. 
, from Marxism. 
 In the great split of interna-tional Social-Democracy into an opportunist wing (or,“Bernsteinian”) and a revolutionary wing, this trend hastaken up an entirely indefinite and impermissibly irreso-lute position between two stools. 
 Basing itself solely onthe bourgeois and opportunist criticism of Marxism, it has pronounced the latter to have been “shaken” ( Vestnik Rus-skoi Revolutsii , No. 
 2, p. 
 62), and promised, on its part, to “revise” Marxism anew, in its own way, but has donenothing whatever to fulfil this ominous promise. 
 2) Because the Socialist-Revolutionary trend helplessly yields to the dominant tendency in Russian social and political thought which should be termed liberal Narodism. 
 Repeating the error of the Narodnaya Volya and of oldRussian socialism in general, the Socialist-Revolutionariesfail to see the sheer flabbiness and internal contradictionsof this tendency; their independent creative contributionto Russian revolutionary thought is restricted to tacking revolutionary phrases on to the old testament of liberal Narodnik wisdom. 
 Russian Marxism was the first to under-mine the theoretical foundations of liberal Narodism,to lay bare its bourgeois and petty-bourgeois class con-tent, and to have waged and continue to wage war againstit, undeterred by the desertion of a swarm of critical ( =op-portunist) Marxists to the enemy camp. 
 But the stand the Socialist-Revolutionaries have been holding in thiswar is ( at best ) one of hostile neutrality; here again they /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR have seated themselves between two stools, between Rus-sian Marxism (from which they have borrowed only a few paltry shreds) and quasi-socialist liberal Narodism. 
 3) Because the Socialist-Revolutionaries, owing to their above-mentioned complete lack of principle in questionsof international and Russian socialism, do not understandor do not recognise the only really revolutionary prin-ciple, that of the class struggle . 
 They do not understand that only a party which fuses socialism with the Russian working-class movement being engendered with increasing force and of an increasing scale by the growth of Russiancapitalism can be really revolutionary and truly socialistin Russia today. 
 The attitude of the Socialist-Revolution-aries towards the Russian working-class movement has always been that of dilettante spectators, and when, for instance, that movement contracted the illness of “econo-mism” (as a consequence of its amazingly rapid growth)the Socialist-Revolutionaries, on the one hand, gloatedover the mistakes made by people who were working at thenew and difficult task of rousing the masses of the work-ers, and, on the other hand, put a spoke in the wheel of revolutionary Marxism when it launched and victori-ously carried through the struggle against this “econo-mism”. 
 A half-hearted attitude towards the working-classmovement inevitably leads in fact to aloofness from it,and owing to this aloofness the Socialist-Revolutionary Party has no social basis whatever. 
 It does not rely upon any social class, for the term class cannot be applied toa group of unstable intellectuals who qualify their vague-ness and lack of principle as “broadness”. 
 4) Because by assuming a disdainful attitude towards socialist ideology and seeking to rely simultaneously and in an equal degree upon the intelligentsia, the proletariat, and the peasantry, the Socialist-Revolutionary Party there-by inevitably (whether it wants to or not) leads to thepolitical and ideological enslavement of the Russian pro-letariat by Russian bourgeois democracy. 
 A disdainfulattitude towards theory, evasiveness, and shilly-shallying with regard to socialist ideology inevitably play into the hands of bourgeois ideology. 
 As social strata compar-able with the proletariat, the Russian intelligentsia and the Russian peasantry can serve as the mainstay only of a bourgeois-democratic movement. 
 This is not only a consideration that stems necessarily from our teachings as a whole (which regard the small producer, for instance,as revolutionary only to the extent that he makes a cleanbreak with the society of commodity economy and capitalismand places himself at the standpoint of the proletariat)—no, it is also an absolute fact which is already beginning to make itself felt. 
 At the moment of the political revo-lution and on the day after this-revolution, this fact willinevitably make itself felt with still greater force. 
Socialist-Revolutionarism is one of the manifestations ofpetty-bourgeois ideological instability and petty-bourgeoisvulgarisation of socialism, against which Social-Democracy must and will always wage determined war. 
 5) Because the practical demands of the programme which the Socialist-Revolutionaries have—I won’t saybrought forward, but at least—outlined have already quiteclearly revealed the enormous harm caused in practice bythe unprincipled character of this trend. 
 For example, their agrarian minimum programme as outlined in No. 
 8 of Revolutsionnaya Rossiya 64 (perhaps it would be more correct to say: scattered among the time-worn premisesof our Narodism?) in the first place misleads both the peas-antry by promising it a “minimum”—socialisation of theland—and the working class by giving it an entirely wrong impression of the true nature of the peasant movement. 
 Such frivolous promises only compromise a revolutionaryparty in general; in particular they compromise the teachingof scientific socialism concerning the socialisation of allmeans of production as our ultimate aim. 
 Secondly, by in-cluding the support and development of co-operatives in their minimum programme, the Socialist-Revolutionaries completely abandon the ground of revolutionary struggleand degrade their so-called socialism to the level of themost banal petty-bourgeois reformism. 
 Thirdly, by opposingthe demand of the Social-Democrats for the abolition ofall the medieval fetters that bind our village commune, tie the muzhik to his allotment, deny him freedom of move-ment, and unavoidably entail his humiliation as memberof his social-estate, the Socialist-Revolutionaries have shown that they have not been able even to safeguard themselves against the reactionary doctrines of Russian Narodism. 
 6) Because the Socialist-Revolutionaries, by including terrorism in their programme and advocating it in its pres-ent-day form as a means of political struggle, are therebydoing the most serious harm to the movement, destroyingthe indissoluble ties between socialist work and themass of the revolutionary class. 
 No verbal assurances and vows can disprove the unquestionable fact that present-day terrorism, as practised and advocated by the Socialist-Revolu-tionaries, is not connected in any way with work among the masses, for the masses, or together with the masses; thatthe organisation of terroristic acts by the Party distractsour very scanty organisational forces from their difficult and by no means completed task of organising a revolution-ary workers’ party; that in practice the terrorism of the Socialist-Revolutionaries is nothing else than single combat , a method that has been wholly condemned by the experienceof history. 
 Even foreign socialists are beginning to becomeembarrassed by the noisy advocacy of terrorism advanced today by our Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
 Among the masses of the Russian workers this advocacy simply sows harmfulillusions, such as the idea that terrorism “compels peopleto think politically, even against their will” ( Revolutsionnaya Rossiya , No. 
 7, p. 
 4), or that “more effectively than months of verbal propaganda it is capable of changing the views... of thousands of people with regard to the revolutionaries and the meaning [!!] of their activity”, or that it is ca-pable of “infusing new strength into the waverers, thosediscouraged and shocked by the sad outcome of many demon-strations” ( ibid . 
), and so on. 
 These harmful illusions can only bring about early disappointment and weaken the work of preparing the masses for the onslaught upon the autocracy. 
 Written in June-July 1902 First published in 1923 in Published according the magazine Prozhektor , No. 
 14 to the manuscript TWO LETTERS TO I. 
 I. 
 RADCHENKO I Dear Friend, First of all, my heartiest congratulations to you (and your friends) on a tremendous success: the beginning of thereorganisation of the Local Committee. 
 65 This may be-come a turning-point for our whole movement, and it is therefore of the utmost importance and urgency to carrythrough this reorganisation to the end . 
 Take particular care of yourself, so that you should manage to complete it. 
 Let me get down to business now. 
 You ask me to help you “with a concrete outline of a plan for local work in con-nection with all-Russia activities”. 
 In order to meetyour request immediately, I am for the time being writingto express my personal opinion (so as not to delay matters by having to contact the other members of the Editor-ial Board, who are at present scattered in different places;they will possibly also send you a few words themselveslater). 
 I am not quite sure whether I understand your requestcorrectly. 
 My sources now are: your letter of June 21 andthe letter of 2a 3b 66 about the two meetings (you, 2a 3b, and Krasikov) with Vanya (the St. 
 Petersburg League67). 
 Judging from these sources (especially the latter), Vanya“now shares our views and frankly acknowledges the demeritsof his former stand”. 
 Proceeding from this, I shall con-tinue to write, addressing myself both to you and to Vanya,and I leave it entirely to you to decide whether to trans-mit my letter to Vanya ( and Manya =the Workers’ Organi-sation68) immediately or later, whether to give it in full or with certain amendments, which in case of necessity I likewise authorise you to make (informing us of all such amendments as far as possible, of course). 
 Strictly speaking, I am of course unable to give you just now a “concrete outline of a plan for Local work inconnection with all-Russia activities”: it is impossiblefor me to do this without a number of detailed conferences both with Vanya and with Manya. 
 All that I can offer isan outline of the practical steps that Vanya should take immediately and before all else, once he has become a new Vanya or wants to become so de facto . 
 It seems to me that the steps planned by all of you at the second meeting withVanya (and described in the letter of 2a 3b) are wholly cor-rect. 
 I fully agree that “the first thing to do is openly todeclare oneself an adherent of certain views”. 
 This is the very thing that must come first, and it can be done only by an open declaration. 
 69 I am fully aware of the fact that most or many of Vanya’s comrades (i. 
e. 
, the committeesand their members) are strongly prejudiced against such opendeclarations or at least are unaccustomed to them. 
 Thistrait is quite comprehensible from the angle of the stage of the movement that has already been passed and of the mis-takes that have already been rejected. 
 But just becauseVanya holds such an important position, just because inthe past he openly declared his old views, which were de-cidedly at variance with the Iskra views, just because of all this I would particularly earnestly advise the comrades ( =Vanya) to overcome this feeling of estrangement and this prejudice. 
 Hitherto our local work has suffered mostly fromnarrowness and isolation, from the reluctance of the localleaders to tackle actively and resolutely the job of work-ing out general Party questions. 
 Then let Vanya, as he comesover to the adherents of revolutionary Social-Democracy, break with this tradition at once and declare for all to hear that these are his fundamental theoretical views and organisational ideas and that he himself is now going to fight for the realisation of these ideas, urging all othercommittees to follow suit. 
 This declaration will be of enor-mous importance both to Vanya and to the whole of Rus-sia; it will be a big event in itself. 
 We need not be afraid of offending Vanya’s old friends, who held different views;every shadow of offence will be removed by the very fact that Vanya himself will openly and frankly admit that circumstances and experience have convinced him of the, erroneousness of the former theoretical views, tactical principles, and organisational plans, in one way or anotherbound up with “economism”. 
 There will not be even the sem-blance of an attack on these old views here, but merelyan avowal of his own evolution. 
 The frank straightfor-wardness of this avowal will exert an influence on the actual unification of all Russian Social-Democrats and on the full cessation of the “polemics” between them, which willbe ten times as great as a hundred protests against the“polemics”. 
 And so, first and foremost, an open and printed decla-ration (in a local bulletin or in Iskra , preferably in both). 
 This step should absolutely not be delayed even for a single week, for without it all other steps may easily prove futile (arrests, etc. 
), while with it the new road would be estab-lished at once. 
 What should this declaration contain? If Vanya were to ask my comradely advice on this point ( but not before he asked me , of course ) I would reply: 1) an express repudia-tion of his old views (theoretical, tactical, and organisa-tional) with a most general description of these views (inone or two words, if possible). 
 2) A declaration thathe is joining the Iskra supporters, subscribes to its theo-retical, tactical, and organisational views, and recognises it as the leading organ (N. 
B. 
, the word “leading” does not at all mean that one necessarily has to agree with itin everything. 
 It merely implies solidarity with the guiding principles of a certain organ. 
 This declaration is fully com-patible both with a reference to particular differences, should any exist, and with an intimation that I want the follow-ing changes and that I, now an Iskra supporter, will strive to effect them, and try to get these changes made in Iskra ). 
 3) Special emphasis on the demand for the unification or,more accurately, the actual restoration of a united all-Russia Social-Democratic Labour Party, by means of joint work, which should begin with a rallying about Iskra so as to convert it into an instrument of genuinely nation-wide agitation and which (the work) should lead tothe creation of a militant all-Russia organisation, capable of launching a determined onslaught on the autocracy. 
 4) An acknowledgement (already made, but not yet pub-lished by Vanya) of the need to reorganise the structure and functioning of Vanya and Manya (their relationships, etc. 
),an announcement (so to speak) of a revision of their struc-ture. 
 5) An acknowledgement of the need for closer linksand fusion with the Russian Iskra organisation 70 so as to accomplish the tasks Vanya and this organisation will henceforth share. 
 6) The assignment of one or several mem-bers (perhaps from Vanya and from Manya, etc. 
) of theSt. 
 Petersburg Committee for the matter of immediatelybeginning the practical realisation of the above-mentionedtask, i. 
e. 
, fusion with Iskra and unification of the Party. 
 * Of these six points, the sixth, of course, can by no means be made public, which may likewise be the case with some of the other points as well. 
 The declaration could concludewith an ellipsis, and make the frank reservation that suchand such (or “subsequent”) points cannot be made publicfor reasons of secrecy. 
 But I repeat: if Vanya has reallycome over to our side he should not postpone this declara-tion for even a single week . 
 It is at such a meeting of delegates from the St. 
 Peters-burg Committee with Sonya (the Russian Iskra organisa-tion) and with the Iskra Editorial Board (abroad) that a really concrete plan will be prepared, not only for the reor-ganisation of work in St. 
 Petersburg, but also for the ac-tual unification of the Party, the constitution of an Or-ganising Committee to prepare the Second Party Congress,etc. 
, etc. 
, etc. 
 Further, at your second meeting it was proposed that “before proceeding to carry out the above-mentioned plan[to send delegates abroad in July] a preliminary examination be made of the state of affairs in various areas of our vast fatherland so as to have a basis for discussion at the con-gress”. 
 I consider this decision (I say so quite frankly) a mis-take, and I would advise you to abandon it. 
 It means de-laying matters and dispersing your forces. 
 Let us firstachieve a single objective: let us (we and Vanya) reach *This (§6) has also already been settled de facto at your second meeting: sending comrades abroad for the purpose of coming to afinal understanding. 
 an understanding among ourselves. 
 This will already be equivalent to complete solidarity between Vanya and Sonya. 
 And given this solidarity, the next practical task (a tour of Russia) will be accomplished by Vanya /FL0149Sonya ( &or=?) quite easily. 
 But there is no sense in dispersing our effortsnow: first (1) let us finally convince Vanya and Manya, then (2) publicly announce our standpoint, further (3) come to an immediate understanding with Iskra (abroad, where Iskra already has a whole file of material on the state of affairs in the various localities of our vast father-land; don’t disdain this file, comrades!) and (4) with Sonya,and only then (5) tour Russia with the express practicalaim of the actual unification of the work (and the convo-cation of a general Party congress). 
 There, if you please, is a “concrete outline of a plan” of immediate practical tasks. 
 If § 2 presents difficulties,§ 3 can be moved to first place (this, of course, willentail some delay, but under certain circumstances anunavoidable delay). 
 But both 2 and 3 must be insisted on atall costs. 
 Moreover, it is of the utmost importance that the members of Vanya who are coming here should be invested with the fullest possible powers and that if possible therebe two of them rather than one (although this really dependsentirely on the local conditions, and of those you are in abetter position to judge). 
 I believe I can conclude with this. 
 Please let me know your opinion as soon as possible: have I understood your request correctly? is my “concrete plan” feasible?etc. 
 I am afraid that things are not yet so good and thatVanya is not yet a full adherent. 
 What is particularlysuspicious is that Manya has not yet been given What Is to Be Done? * It would be a good thing if you could meet with Vanya again in pleno (i. 
e. 
, at a full session of the St. 
 Petersburg Committee): this would be of the utmostimportance in accurately establishing whether there are any opponents, just who they are, and what main points theyadvance. 
 It would be of equal importance that you meetwith Manya directly. 
 You must hasten Vanya’s trip here (and it would be good for Manya to come too!) a s m u c h *See present edition, Vol. 
 5. 
— Ed. 
 a s p o s s i b l e a n d a t a l l c o s t s (have them come straight to London; give them the London address without fail and also Meshcheryakov’s Belgian address for all eventualities). 
 If you succeed in doing this, it willalready be a great achievement guaranteeing that your workwill bear fruit even if you are all arrested now. 
 Anddon’t forget a contingency like that is quite possible, andthat it is therefore imperative to accomplish the first real step (declaration, trip) as quickly as possible and without the slightest delay. 
 If in fact Vanya unreservedly becomes one of us , then we shall hold the Second Party Congress within a few monthsand make Iskra a fortnightly or even a weekly organ of the Party. 
 Try to convince Vanya that we haven’t the slightest intention of distracting him from local work, that St. 
 Pe-tersburg is a “locality” which is of direct importance to the whole of Russia as well, that the merger of Vanya withSonya will greatly intensify local work, and will at the sametime immediately lift the whole Party out of its semi-spec-tral state and raise it to the stage not only of reality, but also of a power of prime importance.

 3 II Dear Friend, The news you sent us recently about the release of Va-nya’s friends—the “allies” ( =supporters of Rabocheye Dye-lo)—again gives rise to some doubts in our mind. 
 Will Vanya hold out now? At all events, put the question to him squarely, get a direct reply, and if it is in the negativemake him feel ashamed of himself, using no uncertain lan-guage; in any case, let us know immediately how mattersstand. 
 If Vanya has again got (or even is about to get) outof our hands, it is all the more imperative that you devote trebled efforts to Manya, if possible to her directly; if not, through your new friends, the conversation with whomyou have described to us in such detail and so interestingly. 
 You should make it your business (if Vanya shows even the slightest signs of unreliability or evasiveness) to pre-pare the St. 
 Petersburg Iskra -ists for war on the remnants of “economism”. 
 Naturally, there is no need to say anything to them about this war, but all efforts must be put intopreparing for it, and as far as possible on both flanks. 
 Thatis, firstly, try to maintain your established personal rela-tions with our friends in the intellectual half of Vanya,try to see them, influence them, make them feel ashamed, meet the young people among them, and prepare the Iskra -ists to break with the waverers. 
 The second flank—the work-ers—is far more important. 
 Your study circle is excellent van-tage-ground, and you must above all see to it that thiscircle develops, becomes conscious of and gives expressionto its hostility towards Vanya. 
 Try to supply this circle with What Is to Be Done? and to achieve (judging by your letter, this is not at all difficult) complete unanimity; moreover, you must particularly and emphatically stress the fact that What Is to Be Done? is levelled precisely and mainly against just this “St. 
 Petersburg” type of people. 
 Dot your i’s in your discussions with them, constantly refer-ring to Vanya as a bad example, an example of what shouldnot be done. 
 I am more than ready to help you in any wayI can—for instance, through a series of letters to the circle. 
First, let this circle become Iskra -ist consciously and in full, become consciously and unreservedly hostile to all of the old “St. 
 Petersburg truck”, to Rabochaya Mysl , to Rabo-cheye Delo , and to all shilly-shallying. 
 Then (and only then ) we shall do the following: the declaration you advisedVanya to make and I wrote to you about in detail will bemade, in somewhat altered form of course, by the circle,which will raise the “banner of insurrection” against Va-nya’s “economists”, and announce a direct campaign for the purpose of winning all of Manya over to its side. 
 I do not doubt for a moment that this campaign will end in complete and rapid victory, and I consider thatit is not this campaign which constitutes the main difficul-ty, but the matter of getting people to the point of embark-ing on an open campaign, of not slipping into compromises with Vanya once more, into making concessions to him, intoprocrastination, etc. 
 Absolutely no compromises whatever, and ruthless war against the slightest remnants of “econo-mism” and amateurishness—that, in my opinion, is the taskyou should set yourself in the circle. 
 Better lose three months, half a year, or even more on preparations, and create a militant Iskra -ist circle rather than unite unprepared people with Vanya’s diplomats and cunctators. 
 Make use of the fact that you have a free hand in the circle and pursue your policy resolutely, keeping peoplewho are not entirely with you well at a distance. 
 If you manage matters in this way, you will be inde-pendent of Vanya’s waverings and vacillations; you willhave y o u r o w n foothold. 
 And if you occasionally have to manoeuvre in your dealings with Vanya, you mustnot resort to the slightest attempt at manoeuvringin the circle, but at all times maintain an attitude of irre-concilability towards Vanya there. 
 Your tactics will then be quite simple: if Vanya comes closer to you, pat him onthe head, but keep tight hold of the stick in your other hand, i. 
e. 
, don’t conceal from him the fact that this is not enough, that it is necessary to come over the whole way and come in, and that a little will not satisfy you. 
 If Vanya drifts away, don’t let him get away with a single mistake,with a single misstep. 
 It should be one of your main tasksto fasten on to each of Vanya’s blunders, and make it a sub-ject of merciless exposure and condemnation in the circle(and as far as possible in Iskra too from time to time). 
 In a word, in your relations with Vanya hold steadfast-ly to the principle: I want peace with you and to that endI am preparing thoroughly for war against you. 
 A piece of practical advice in conclusion. 
 By nature Vanya is a diplomat and a pedant. 
 He has now raised thequestion of alterations in the hovel and it is most likely that on the plausible pretext of this “revision of structure” he will drag things out, invent thousands of compromises, etc. 
Don’t fall for this bait. 
 Mercilessly deride love of com-piling rules. 
 It is not a matter of rules, and whoever thinksit possible to draw up model rules on the basis of certaintactical and organisational ideas understands absolutely nothing at all and must be thoroughly hounded for this lack of understanding. 
 If Vanya imagines that they willdiscuss the new rules from all angles, rewrite forty para-graphs out of the fifty, and then “to a good feast and the wed-ding”, i. 
e. 
, that the new work will then begin in accordancewith the new rules—if he (as is obvious from everything) imagines this, then it means that he has discarded his old prejudices only in word and that actually he still retainshundreds of stupid ideas against which we must fight andfight again. 
 Castigate pedantry and formalism, and pointout that it is not a matter of rules but of 1) coming to anagreement on views, thinking them over thoroughly , and 2) of reaching mutual understanding in the practical work itself . 
 With this as our standpoint, we snap our fingers at your (Vanya’s) game of rules and state flatly—who we are, whatwe want and how we work is something you know, andshould know, not only from our publications, but also from personal meetings in Russia and abroad (such meetings are unavoidable in the revolutionary movement). 
 If you do notcare to go hand in hand with us, say so outright, don’t hedge, and bear in mind that we will wage a real war against all hedging. 
 Don’t imagine that you will be able to conceal your hedging from us behind revisions of rules, and the like. 
 But if you want to go hand in hand with us, get down towork at once , and then you will see that this work in con-nection with an all-Russia newspaper, on the paper andwith it as a basis, will itself show what new forms arerequired, and will probably (and even undoubtedly) show that, given a genuine and live movement, these forms will take shape of themselves, without any rules. 
 And when we arestrong, we shall organise meetings and conferences four timesa year in Russia and twice abroad (or vice versa , depending on circumstances), and all rules will be determined at theseconferences (to put it more plainly—we shall send all rules to the devil). 
 I warmly shake your hand, and I am waiting impatiently for your reply. 
 Do my letters hit the nail on the head, i. 
e. 
,do they give you what you want? Yours, Lenin Written on July 9 (22), 1902 First published in 1928 in Published according V.

 V REVOLUTIONARY ADVENTURISM I We are living in stormy times, when Russia’s history is marching on with seven-league strides, and every yearsometimes signifies more than decades of tranquillity. 
Results of the half-century of the post-Reform period arebeing summed up, and the corner-stone is being laid forsocial and political edifices which will determine the fate of the entire country for many, many years to come. 
 The rev-olutionary movement continues to grow with amazingrapidity—and “our trends” are ripening (and withering)uncommonly fast. 
 Trends firmly rooted in the class systemof such a rapidly developing capitalist country as Russiaalmost immediately reach their own level and feel their way to the classes they are related to. 
 An example is the evolution of Mr. 
 Struve, from whom the revolutionaryworkers proposed to “tear the mask” of a Marxist only oneand a half years ago and who has now himself come forwardwithout this mask as the leader (or servant?) of the liberallandlords, people who take pride in their earthiness and their sober judgement. 
 On the other hand, trends expressing only the traditional instability of views held by the intermediateand indefinite sections of the intelligentsia try to substitutenoisy declarations for rapprochement with definite classes, declarations which are all the noisier, the louder the thunderof events. 
 “At least we make an infernal noise” 71—such is the slogan of many revolutionarily minded individuals who have been caught up in the maelstrom of events and whohave neither theoretical principles nor social roots. 
 It is to these “noisy” trends that the “Socialist-Revo-lutionaries”, whose physiognomy is emerging more and more clearly, also belong. 
 And it is high time for the pro-letariat to have a better look at this physiognomy, and forma clear idea of the real nature of these people, who seekthe proletariat’s friendship all the more persistently, themore palpable it becomes to them that they cannot existas a separate trend without close ties with the truly revo-lutionary class of society. 
 Three circumstances have served most to disclose the true face of the Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
 These are, first,the split between the revolutionary Social-Democrats andthe opportunists, who are raising their heads under thebanner of the “criticism of Marxism”. 
 Secondly, Balma-shov’s assassination of Sipyagin and the new swing towards terrorism in the sentiments of some revolutionaries. 
 Third-ly and mainly, the latest movement among the peasantry,which has compelled such that are accustomed to sit betweentwo stools and have no programme whatever to come outpost factum with some semblance of a programme. 
 We shall proceed to examine these three circumstances, with the reservation that in a newspaper article it is possible to giveonly a brief outline of the main points in the argument andthat we shall in all likelihood return to the subject andexpound it in greater detail in a magazine article, or in apamphlet. 
 72 It was only in No. 
 2 of Vestnik Russkoi Revolutsii that the Socialist-Revolutionaries finally decided to come outwith a theoretical statement of principle, in an unsignededitorial headed “The World Progress and Crisis of Social-ism”. 
 We strongly recommend this article to all who wantto get a clear idea of utter unprincipledness and vacilla-tion in matters of theory (as well as of the art of conceal-ing this behind a spate of rhetoric). 
 The entire content of thishighly noteworthy article may be expressed in a few words. 
Socialism has grown into a world force, socialism ( =Marx-ism) is now splitting as a result of the war of the revo-lutionaries (the “orthodox”) against the opportunists (the “critics”). 
 We, Socialist-Revolutionaries, “of course” have never sympathised with opportunism, but we are over-joyed because of the “criticism” which has freed us from a dogma; we too are working for a revision of this dogma— and although we have as yet nothing at all to show by way of criticism (except bourgeois-opportunist criticism), al-though we have as yet revised absolutely nothing, it isnevertheless that freedom from theory which redounds to ourcredit. 
 That redounds to our credit all the more because, aspeople free of theory, we stand firmly for general unityand vehemently condemn all theoretical disputes over prin-ciples. 
 “A serious revolutionary organisation”, Vestnik Rus-skoi Revolutsii (No. 
 2, p. 
 127) assures us in all seriousness, “would give up trying to settle disputed questions of socialtheory, which always lead to disunity, although this ofcourse should not hinder theoreticians from seekingtheir solution”—or, more outspokenly: let the writers do the writing and the readers do the reading 73 and in the meantime, while they are busying themselves, we willrejoice at the blank left behind. 
 There is no need, of course, to engage in a serious analysis of this theory of deviation from socialism (in the event ofdisputes proper). 
 In our opinion, the crisis of socialism makes it incumbent upon any in the least serious socialists to devote redoubled attention to theory—to adopt more resolutely astrictly definite stand, to draw a sharper line of demarcationbetween themselves and wavering and unreliable elements. 
In the opinion of the Socialist-Revolutionaries, however,if such things as confusion and splits are possible “even among Germans”, then it is God’s will that we, Russians, should pride ourselves on our ignorance of whither we aredrifting. 
 In our opinion, the absence of theory deprives arevolutionary trend of the right to existence and inevitablycondemns it, sooner or later, to political bankruptcy. 
 Inthe opinion of the Socialist-Revolutionaries, however, the absence of theory is a most excellent thing, most favourable “for unity”. 
 As you see, we cannot reach agreement withthem, for the fact of the matter is that we even speak differentlanguages. 
 There is one hope: perhaps they will be made tosee reason by Mr. 
 Struve, who also (only more seriously)speaks about the elimination of dogma and says that “our” business (as is the business of any bourgeoisie that appeals to the proletariat) is not to disunite, but to unite. 
 Will notthe Socialist-Revolutionaries ever see, with the help of Mr. 
 Struve, what is really signified by their stand of liberation from socialism for the purpose of unity, and unity on the occasion of liberation from socialism? Let us go over to the second point, the question of ter-rorism. 
 In their defence of terrorism, which the experience of the Russian revolutionary movement has so clearly provedto be ineffective, the Socialist-Revolutionaries are talking themselves blue in the face in asseverating that they rec-ognise terrorism only in conjunction with work among themasses, and that therefore the arguments used by the RussianSocial-Democrats to refute the efficacy of this method ofstruggle (and which have indeed been refuted for a long timeto come) do not apply to them. 
 Here something very similar to their attitude towards “criticism” is repeating itself. 
 We are not opportunists, cry the Socialist-Revolutionaries, andat the same time they are shelving the dogma of proletariansocialism, for reason of sheer opportunist criticism andno other. 
 We are not repeating the terrorists’ mistakesand are not diverting attention from work among the masses, the Socialist-Revolutionaries assure us, and at the same time enthusiastically recommend to the Party acts such as Bal-mashov’s assassination of Sipyagin, although everyone knowsand sees perfectly well that this act was in no way connectedwith the masses and, moreover, could not have been by reasonof the very way in which it was carried out—that the persons who committed this terrorist act neither counted on nor hoped for any definite action or support on the part of themasses. 
 In their naïveté, the Socialist-Revolutionaries donot realise that their predilection for terrorism is caus-ally most intimately linked with the fact that, from the veryoutset, they have always kept, and still keep, aloof from the working-class movement, without even attempting to become a party of the revolutionary class which is waging its classstruggle. 
 Over-ardent protestations very often lead one todoubt and suspect the worth of whatever it is that requiressuch strong seasoning. 
 Do not these protestations wearythem?—I often think of these words, when I read assurances by the Socialist-Revolutionaries: “by terrorism we are not relegating work among the masses into the background”. 
 Afterall, these assurances come from the very people who have al-ready drifted away from the Social-Democratic labour move-ment, which really rouses the masses; they come from people who are continuing to drift away from this movement, clutching at fragments of any kind of theory. 
 The leaflet issued by the “Party of the Socialist-Revo-lutionaries” on April 3, 1902, may serve as a splendid illus-tration of what has been stated above. 
 It is a most real-istic source, one that is very close to the immediate leaders, a most authentic source. 
 The “presentation of the question of terrorist struggle” in this leaflet “coincides in full” also“with the Party views”, according to the valuable testimonyof Revolutsionnaya Rossiya (No. 
 7, p. 
 24). 
 * The April 3 leaflet follows the pattern of the terror-ists’ “latest” arguments with remarkable accuracy. 
 The first thing that strikes the eye is the words: “we advocate terrorism, not in place of work among the masses, but pre-cisely for and simultaneously with that work”. 
 They strikethe eye particularly because these words are printed in let-ters three times as large as the rest of the text (a device thatis of course repeated by Revolutsionnaya Rossiya ). 
 It is all really so simple! One has only to set “not in place of, but together with” in bold type—and all the arguments ofthe Social-Democrats, all that history has taught, willfall to the ground. 
 But just read the whole leaflet and youwill see that the protestation in bold type takes the nameof the masses in vain. 
 The day “when the working people will emerge from the shadows” and “the mighty popular wave will shatter the iron gates to smithereens”—“alas!”(literally, “alas!”) “is still a long way off, and it is fright-*True, Revolutsionnaya Rossiya does some juggling with this point also. 
 On the one hand—“coincides in full”, on the other—a hintabout “exaggerations”. 
 On the one hand, Revolutsionnaya Rossiya declares that this leaflet comes from only “one group” of Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
 On the other hand, it is a fact that the leaflet bears the imprint “Published by the Socialist-Revolutionary Party. 
”Moreover, it carries the motto of this same Revolutsionnaya Rossiya (“By struggle you will achieve your rights”). 
 We appreciate thatRevolutsionnaya Rossiya finds it disagreeable to touch on this ticklish point but we believe that it is simply unseemly to play at hide-and-seek in such cases. 
 The existence of “economism” was just as disagree-able to revolutionary Social-Democracy, but the latter exposed itopenly, without ever making the slightest attempt to mislead anyone. 
 ful to think of the future toll of victims!” Do not these words “alas, still a long way off” reflect an utter failure to under-stand the mass movement and a lack of faith in it? Is not this argument meant as a deliberate sneer at the fact thatthe working people are already beginning to rise? And,finally, even if this trite argument were just as well-foundedas it is actually stuff and nonsense, what would emerge fromit in particularly bold relief would be the inefficacy of ter-rorism, for without the working people all bombs are power-less, patently powerless. 
 Just listen to what follows: “Every terrorist blow, as it were, takes away part of the strength of the autocracy andtransfers [!] all this strength [!] to the side of the fightersfor freedom. 
” “And if terrorism is practised systematically [!l, it is obvious that the scales of the balance will finally weigh down on our side. 
” Yes, indeed, it is obvious to allthat we have here in its grossest form one of the greatestprejudices of the terrorists: political assassination of itself“transfers strength”! Thus, on the one hand you have thetheory of the transference of strength, and on the other— “not in place of, but together with”.... 
 Do not these protes-tations weary them? But this is just the beginning. 
 The real thing is yet to come. 
 “Whom are we to strike down?” asks the party ofthe Socialist-Revolutionaries, and replies: the ministers,and not the tsar, for “the tsar will not allow matters to go to extremes” (!!How did they find that out??), and besides “it is also easier” (this is literally what they say!): “Nominister can ensconce himself in a palace as in a fortress. 
”And this argument concludes with the following piece ofreasoning, which deserves to be immortalised as a modelof the “theory” of the Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
 “Against the crowd the autocracy has its soldiers; against the revolu-tionary organisations its secret and uniformed police; butwhat will save it...” (what kind of “it” is this? The autoc-racy? The author has unwittingly identified the autocracywith a target in the person of a minister whom it is easierto strike down!) “... from individuals or small groups that are ceaselessly, and even in ignorance of one another [!!], prepar-ing for attack, and are attacking? No force will be of availagainst elusiveness. 
 Hence, our task is clear: to remove every one of the autocracy’s brutal oppressors by the only means that has been left [!] us by the autocracy—death. 
” No matter how many reams of paper the Socialist-Revolutionaries may fill with assurances that they are not relegating work amongthe masses into the background or disorganising it by theiradvocacy of terrorism—their spate of words cannot disprovethe fact that the actual psychology of the modern terrorist isfaithfully conveyed in the leaflet we have quoted. 
 The theory of the transference of strength finds its natural complement in the theory of elusiveness, a theory which turns upsidedown, not only all past experience, but all common senseas well. 
 That the only “hope” of the revolution is the “crowd”;that only a revolutionary organisation which leads this crowd(in deed and not in word) can fight against the police—all this is ABC. 
 It is shameful to have to prove this. 
 And only people who have forgotten everything and learned absolutelynothing could have decided “the other way about”, arrivingat the fabulous, howling stupidity that the autocracy canbe “saved” from the crowd by soldiers, and from the rev-olutionary organisations by the police, but that there is no salvation from individuals who hunt down ministers!! This fabulous argument, which we are convinced is destined to become notorious, is by no means simply a curi-osity. 
 No, it is instructive because, through a sweepingreduction to an absurdity, it reveals the principal mistake ofthe terrorists, which they share with the “economists” (per-haps one might already say, with the former representatives of deceased “economism”?) This mistake, as we have alreadypointed out on numerous occasions, consists in the fail-ure to understand the basic defect of our movement. 
 Because of the extremely rapid growth of the movement, the lead-ers lagged behind the masses, the revolutionary organ-isations did not come up to the level of the revolutionary activity of the proletariat, were incapable of marching on infront and leading the masses. 
 That a discrepancy of thissort exists cannot be doubted by any conscientious personwho has even the slightest acquaintance with the movement. 
And if that is so, it is evident that the present-day terrorists are really “economists” turned inside out, going to the equal-ly foolish but opposite extreme. 
 At a time when the revolu-tionaries are short of the forces and means to lead the masses, who are already rising, an appeal to resort to such terrorist acts as the organisation of attempts on the lives of minis-ters by individuals and groups that are not known to one another means, not only thereby breaking off work among the masses, but also introducing downright disorganisationinto that work. 
 We, revolutionaries, “are accustomed to huddling together in timid knots,” we read in the April 3 leaflet, “and even [N. 
B. 
] the new, bold spirit that has appeared during the last two or three years has so far done more toraise the sentiments of the crowd than of individuals. 
”These words unintentionally express much that is true. 
 Andit is this very truth that deals a smashing rebuff to the pro-pagandists of terrorism. 
 From this truth every thinking socialist draws the conclusion that it is necessary to use group action more energetically, boldly, and harmoniously. 
The Socialist-Revolutionaries, however, conclude: “Shoot,elusive individual, for the knot of people, alas, is still along way off, and besides there are soldiers against theknot. 
” This really defies all reason, gentlemen! Nor does the leaflet eschew the theory of excitative terrorism. 
 “Each time a hero engages in single combat,this arouses in us all a spirit of struggle and courage,” weare told. 
 But we know from the past and see in the pres-ent that only new forms of the mass movement or the awaken-ing of new sections of the masses to independent struggle really rouses a spirit of struggle and courage in all . 
 Single combat however, inasmuch as it remains single combat waged by the Balmashovs, has the immediate effect ofsimply creating a short-lived sensation, while indirectlyit even leads to apathy and passive waiting for the nextbout . 
 We are further assured that “every flash of terror-ism lights up the mind”, which, unfortunately, we have not noticed to be the case with the terrorism-preaching partyof the Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
 We are presented withthe theory of big work and petty work. 
 “Let not those whohave greater strength, greater opportunities and resolutionrest content with petty [!] work; let them find and devote themselves to a big cause—the propaganda of terrorism among the masses [!], the preparation of the intricate ...[the theory of elusiveness is already forgotten!] ... terror ist ventures. 
” How amazingly clever this is in all truth: to sacrifice the life of a revolutionary for the sake of wreaking vengeance on the scoundrel Sipyagin, who is then replaced by the scoundrel Plehve—that is big work. 
 But to prepare,for instance , the masses for an armed demonstration—that is petty work. 
 This very point is explained in No. 
 8 ofRevolutsionnaya Rossiya , which declares that “it is easy to write and speak” of armed demonstrations “as a matter of the vague and distant future”, “but up till now all this talk has been merely of a theoretical nature”. 
 How well weknow this language of people who are free of the constraintof firm socialist convictions, of the burdensome experi-ence of each and every kind of popular movement! Theyconfuse immediately tangible and sensational results with practicalness. 
 To them the demand to adhere steadfastly to the class standpoint and to maintain the mass natureof the movement is “vague” “theorising”. 
 In their eyes def-initiveness is slavish compliance with every turn of sen-timent and ... and, by reason of this compliance, inevitablehelplessness at each turn demonstrations begin—and blood-thirsty words, talk about the beginning of the end, flow from the lips of such people. 
 The demonstrations halt—their hands drop helplessly, and before they have had timeto wear out a pair of boots they are already shouting: “Thepeople, alas, are still a long way off.... 
” Some new outrageis perpetrated by the tsar’s henchmen—and they demand to be shown a “definite” measure that would serve as an ex-haustive reply to that particular outrage, a measure that would bring about an immediate “transference of strength”,and they proudly promise this transference! These peopledo not understand that this very promise to “transfer”strength constitutes political adventurism, and that their adventurism stems from their lack of principle. 
 The Social-Democrats will always warn against adven-turism and ruthlessly expose illusions which inevitably endin complete disappointment. 
 We must bear in mind that arevolutionary party is worthy of its name only when itguides in deed the movement of a revolutionary class. 
 We must bear in mind that any popular movement assumes an infinite variety of forms, is constantly developing new formsand discarding the old, and effecting modifications or new combinations of old and new forms. 
 It is our duty to partic-ipate actively in this process of working out means and meth-ods of struggle. 
 When the students’ movement became sharp-er, we began to call on the workers to come to the aid ofthe students ( Iskra , No. 
 2 *) without taking it upon our-selves to forecast the forms of the demonstrations, withoutpromising that they would result in an immediate transfer-ence of strength, in lighting up the mind, or a special elu-siveness. 
 When the demonstrations became consolidated, we began to call for their organisation and for the arming ofthe masses, and put forward the task of preparing a popularuprising. 
 Without in the least denying violence and terror-ism in principle, we demanded work for the preparation ofsuch forms of violence as were calculated to bring about the direct participation of the masses and which guaranteed that participation. 
 We do not close our eyes to the difficultiesof this task, but will work at it steadfastly and persis-tently, undeterred by the objections that this is a matterof the “vague and distant future”. 
 Yes, gentlemen, we standfor future and not only past forms of the movement. 
 We give preference to long and arduous work on what promises a future rather than to an “easy” repetition of what has beencondemned by the past. 
 We shall always expose people whoin word war against hackneyed dogmas and in practice holdexclusively to such moth-eaten and harmful commonplaces asthe theory of the transference of strength, the difference between big work and petty work and, of course, the theory of single combat. 
 “Just as in the days of yore the peoples’battles were fought out by their leaders in single combat,so now the terrorists will win Russia’s freedom in singlecombat with the autocracy,” the April 3 leaflet concludes. 
The mere reprinting of such sentences provides their refutation. 
 Anyone who really carries on his revolutionary work in conjunction with the class struggle of the proletariatvery well knows, sees and feels what vast numbers of imme-diate and direct demands of the proletariat (and of thesections of the people capable of supporting the latter)remain unsatisfied. 
 He knows that in very many places, throughout vast areas, the working people are literally *See present edition, Vol. 
 4, pp.

— Ed. 
 straining to go into action, and that their ardour runs to waste because of the scarcity of literature and leadership, the lack of forces and means in the revolutionary organisa-tions. 
 And we find ourselves—we see that we find our-selves—in the same old vicious circle that has so longhemmed in the Russian revolution like an omen of evil. 
 Onthe one hand, the revolutionary ardour of the insufficientlyenlightened and unorganised crowd runs to waste. 
 On the other hand, shots fired by the “elusive individuals” who are losing faith in the possibility of marching in formation andworking hand in hand with the masses also end in smoke. 
 But things can still be put to rights, comrades! Loss of faith in a real cause is the rare exception rather than therule. 
 The urge to commit terrorist acts is a passing mood. 
 Then let the Social-Democrats close their ranks, and we shall fuse the militant organisation of revolutionaries andthe mass heroism of the Russian proletariat into a singlewhole! In the next article we shall deal with the agrarian pro-gramme of the Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
 II The Socialist-Revolutionaries’ attitude to the peasant movement is of particular interest. 
 It is precisely in the agrarian question that representatives of the old Russian socialism, their liberal-Narodnik descendants, and also adher-ents of opportunist criticism who are so numerous in Russiaand so vociferously pass assurances that on this score Marx-ism has already been conclusively disproved by the “crit-ics”, have always considered themselves especially strong. 
 Our Socialist-Revolutionaries too are tearing Marxism to shreds, so to speak: “dogmatic prejudices ... outlived dogmaslong since refuted by life ... the revolutionary intel-ligentsia has shut its eyes to the countryside, revolutionarywork among the peasantry was forbidden by orthodoxy”,and much else in this vein. 
 It is the current fashion to kick out at orthodoxy. 
 But to what subspecies must one relegate those of the kickers who did not even manage to draw up an outline for an agrarian programme of their own before the commencement of the peasant movement? When Iskra sketched its agrarian programme as early as in No. 
 3, * Vestnik Russkoi Revolutsii could only mutter: “Given such a presentation of the question, still another of our differ-ences is fading away”—what happened here is that the editorsof Vestnik Russkoi Revolutsii had the mishap of utterly fail-ing to understand Iskra ‘s presentation of the question (the “introduction of the class struggle into the country-side”). 
 Revolutsionnaya Rossiya now belatedly refers to the pamphlet entitled The Next Question , although it contains no programme whatever, but only panegyrics on such“celebrated” opportunists as Hertz. 
 And now these same people—who before the commence-ment of the movement were in agreement both with Iskra and with Hertz—come out, on the day following the peasant uprising, with a manifesto “from the peasant league [!]of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party”, a manifesto in whichyou will not find a single syllable really emanating from thepeasantry, but only a literal repetition of what you haveread hundreds of times in the writings of the Narodniks, the liberals, and the “critics”. 
 ... It is said that courage can move mountains. 
 That is so, Messrs. 
 the Socialist-Revolu-tionaries, but it is not to such courage that your garishadvertisement testifies. 
 We have seen that the Socialist-Revolutionaries’ great-est “advantage” lies in their freedom from theory; their greatest skill consists in their ability to speak without say-ing anything. 
 But in order to present a programme, one mustnevertheless say something. 
 It is necessary, for instance,to throw overboard the “dogma of the Russian Social-Dem-ocrats of the late eighties and early nineties to the effectthat there is no revolutionary force save the urban proletar-iat”. 
 What a handy little word “dogma” is! One need only slightly twist an opposing theory, cover up this twist withthe bogy of “dogma”—and there you are! Beginning with the Communist Manifesto , all modern socialism rests on the indisputable truth that the proletar-iat alone is a really revolutionary class in capitalist society. 
 The other classes may and do become revolutionary only in * See present edition, Vol. 
 4, pp.

 part and only under certain conditions. 
 What, then, must one think of people who have “transformed” this truth into a dogma of the Russian Social-Democrats of a definite period and who try to convince the naïve reader that thisdogma was “based entirely on the belief that open politicalstruggle lay far in the future”? To counter Marx’s doctrine that there is only one real-ly revolutionary class in modern society, the Socialist-Revolutionaries advance the trinity: “the intelligentsia, the proletariat, and the peasantry”, thereby revealing a hope-less confusion of concepts. 
 If one sets the intelligentsia againstthe proletariat and the peasantry it means that one con-siders the former a definite social stratum, a group of per-sons occupying just as definite a social position as is oc-cupied by the wage-workers and the peasants. 
 But as such a stratum the Russian intelligentsia is precisely a bour-geois and petty-bourgeois intelligentsia. 
 With regard tothis stratum, Mr. 
 Struve is quite right in calling hispaper the mouthpiece of the Russian intelligentsia. 
 However,if one is referring to those intellectuals who have not yet taken any definite social stand, or have already been thrown off their normal stand by the facts of life, and are passing over to the side of the proletariat, then it is altogetherabsurd to contrapose this intelligentsia to the proletariat. 
Like any other class in modern society, the proletariat isnot only advancing intellectuals from its own midst, but also accepts into its ranks supporters from the midst of all and sundry educated people. 
 The campaign of the Social-ist-Revolutionaries against the basic “dogma” of Marxismis merely additional proof that the entire strength of thisparty is represented by the handful of Russian intellectualswho have broken away from the old, but have not yet adhered to the new. 
 The Socialist-Revolutionaries’ views on the peasantry are even more muddled. 
 To take just the posing of thequestion: “What social classes in general [!] always [!!]cling to the existing ... [the autocratic only? or bourgeoisin general?] ... order, guard it and do not yield to revolution-isation?” As a matter of fact, this question can be answered only by another question: what elements of the intelligen-tsia in general always cling to the existing chaos of ideas, guard it and do not yield to a definite socialist world out-look? But the Socialist-Revolutionaries want to give a seri-ous answer to an insignificant question. 
 To “these” classes they refer, first, the bourgeoisie, since its “interests havebeen satisfied”. 
 This old prejudice that the interests of theRussian bourgeoisie have already been satisfied to such adegree that we neither have nor can have bourgeois democ-racy in our country (cf. 
 Vestnik Russkoi Revolutsii , No. 
 2, pp. 
 132-33) is now shared by the “economists” and the Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
 Again, won’t Mr. 
 Struve teachthem some common sense? Secondly, the Socialist-Revolutionaries include among these classes the “petty-bourgeois strata” “whose interestsare individualistic, undefined as class interests, and do not lend themselves to formulation in a reformative or revolu-tionary socio-political programme”. 
 Whence this has come,the Lord alone knows. 
 It is common knowledge that the pet-ty bourgeoisie does not always and in general guard theexisting order, but on the contrary often takes revolutionaryaction even against the bourgeoisie (specifically, when it joins the proletariat) and very often against absolutism, and that it almost always formulates programmes of social reform. 
Our author has simply come out with a “noisier” declarationagainst the petty bourgeoisie, in accordance with the “prac-tical rule”, which Turgenev expressed through an “oldfox” in one of his “Poems in Prose”: “Cry out most loudly against those vices you yourself feel guilty of. 
” 74 And so, since the Socialist-Revolutionaries feel that the only social basis of their position between two stools can be perhapsprovided only by certain petty-bourgeois sections of theintelligentsia, they therefore write about the petty bourgeoisie as if this term does not signify a social category, but is sim-ply a polemical turn of speech. 
 They likewise want to evade the unpleasant fact of their failure to understand that thepeasantry of today belongs, as a whole, to the “petty-bour-geois strata”. 
 Won’t you try to give us an answer on thisscore, Messrs. 
 the Socialist-Revolutionaries? Won’t you tellus why it is that, while repeating snatches of the theory of Russian Marxism (for example, about the progressive sig-nificance of peasant outside employment and tramping),you turn a blind eye to the fact that this same Marxism has revealed the petty-bourgeois make-up of Russian peasant economy? Won’t you explain to us how it is possible in con-temporary society for “proprietors or semi-proprietors” not to belong to the petty-bourgeois strata? No, harbour no hopes! The Socialist-Revolutionaries will not reply; they will not say or explain anything bear-ing upon the matter, for they (again like the “economists”)have thoroughly learned the tactic of pleading ignorance when it comes to theory. 
 Revolutsionnaya Rossiya looks meaningly towards Vestnik Russkoi Revolutsii —that is their job, they say (cf. 
 No. 
 4, reply to Zarya ), while Vestnik Russkoi Revolutsii informs its readers of the exploits of the opportunist critics and keeps on threatening to make its crit-icism ever sharper. 
 That is hardly enough, gentlemen! The Socialist-Revolutionaries have kept themselves pure of the baneful influence of modern socialist doctrines. 
They have fully preserved the good old methods of vulgarsocialism. 
 We are confronted by a new historical fact, a newmovement among a certain section of the people. 
 They donot examine the condition of this section or set themselves the aim of explaining its movement by the nature of that section and its relation to the developing economic struc-ture of society as a whole. 
 To them, all this is an emptydogma, outlived orthodoxy. 
 They do things more simply:what is it that the representatives of the rising sectionthemselves are speaking about? Land, additional allotments, redistribution of the land. 
 There it is in a nutshell. 
 You have a “semi-socialist programme”, “a thoroughly correctprinciple”, “a bright idea”, “an ideal which already livesin the peasant’s mind in embryo form”, etc. 
 All that isnecessary is to “brush up and elaborate this ideal”, bringout the “pure idea of socialism”. 
 You find this hard to believe, reader? It seems incredible to you that this Narodnik junk should again be dragged into the light of day by peoplewho so glibly repeat whatever the latest book may tell them?And yet this is a fact, and all the words we have quoted arein the declaration “from the peasant league” published inNo. 
 8 of Revolutsionnaya Rossiya . 
 The Socialist-Revolutionaries accuse Iskra of having prematurely tolled the knell of the peasant movementby describing it as the last peasant revolt. 
 The peasantry, they inform us, can participate in the socialist movement of the proletariat as well. 
 This accusation testifies to the confusion of thought among the Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
 They have not even grasped that the democratic movementagainst the remnants of serf-ownership is one thing, andthe socialist movement against the bourgeoisie is quiteanother. 
 Since they have failed to understand the peasantmovement itself, they have likewise been unable to under-stand that the words in Iskra , which frightened them so, refer only to the former movement. 
 Not only has Iskra stated in its programme that the small producers (includingthe peasants), who are being ruined, can and should partici-pate in the socialist movement of the proletariat, but ithas also defined the exact conditions for this participa-tion. 
 The peasant movement of today, however, is not at all a socialist movement directed against the bourgeoisie andcapitalism. 
 On the contrary, it unites the bourgeois andthe proletarian elements in the peasantry, which are reallyone in the struggle against the remnants of the serf-owningsystem. 
 The peasant movement of today is leading—and will lead—to the establishment, not of a socialist or a semi-socialist way of life in the countryside, but of a bourgeoisway of life, and will clear away the feudal debris clutteringup the bourgeois foundations that have already arisen inour countryside. 
 But all this is a sealed book to the Socialist-Revolution-aries. 
 They even assure Iskra in all seriousness that to clear the way for the development of capitalism is an emptydogma, since the “reforms” (of the sixties) “did clear [!]full [!!] space for the development of capitalism”. 
 That iswhat can be written by a glib person who lets a facile penrun away with him and who imagines that the “peasant league” can get away with anything: the peasant won’t see through it! But kindly reflect for a moment, my dearauthor: have you never heard that remnants of the serf-owning system retard the development of capitalism? Don’tyou think that this is even all but tautological? And haven’tyou read somewhere about the remnants of serf-ownership in the present-day Russian countryside? Iskra says that the impending revolution will be a bourgeois revolution. 
 The Socialist-Revolutionaries ob-ject: it will be “primarily a political revolution and to a certain extent a democratic revolution”. 
 Won’t the authors of this pretty objection try to explain this to us— does history know of any bourgeois revolution, or is sucha bourgeois revolution conceivable, that is not “to a cer-tain extent a democratic revolution”? Why, even the pro-gramme of the Socialist-Revolutionaries themselves (equal-itarian tenure of land that has become social property) does not go beyond the limits of a bourgeois programme, since the preservation of commodity production and tolera-tion of private farming, even if it is conducted on commonland, in no way eliminates capitalist relationships in agri-culture. 
 The greater the levity with which the Socialist-Revolu-tionaries approach the most elementary truths of modern socialism, the more easily do they invent “most elementarydeductions”, even taking pride in the fact that their “pro-gramme reduces itself” to such. 
 Let us then examine allthree of their deductions, which most probably will longremain a monument to the keen wit and profound socialist convictions of the Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
 Deduction No. 
 1: “A large portion of the territory of Russia now already belongs to the state—what we needis that all the territory should belong to the people. 
” Ourteeth are “now already” on edge from the touching ref-erences to state ownership of land in Russia contained in the writings of the police Narodniks ( à la Sazonov, etc. 
) and the various Katheder -reformers. 
 75 “What we need” is that people who style themselves socialists and even revolution-aries should trail in the rear of these gentlemen. 
 “Whatwe need” is that socialists should lay stress on the allegedomnipotence of the “state” (forgetting even that a large share of the state land is concentrated in the uninhabited mar-ginal regions of the country), and not on the class antagonismbetween the semi-serf peasantry and the privileged handfulof big landowners, who own most of the best cultivated landand with whom the “state” has always been on the best ofterms. 
 Our Socialist-Revolutionaries, who imagine that they are deducing a pure idea of socialism, are in actual fact sullying this idea by their uncritical attitude towards theold Narodism. 
 Deduction No. 
 2: “The land is now already passing from capital to labour—what we need is that this process be com-pleted by the state. 
” The deeper you go into the forest, the thicker the trees. 
 * Let us take another step towards police Narodism; let us call on the (class!) “state” to extendpeasant landownership in general. 
 This is remarkablysocialistic and amazingly revolutionary. 
 But what can oneexpect of people who call the purchase and lease of land by the peasants a transfer “from capital to labour” and not transfer of land from the feudal-minded landlords to therural bourgeoisie. 
 Let us remind these people at least of thestatistics on the actual distribution of the land that is“passing to labour”: between six-and nine-tenths of all peas-ant-purchased land, and from five-to eight-tenths of all leased land are concentrated in the hands of one-fifth of the peasant households , i. 
e. 
, in the hands of a small minority of well-to-do peasants. 
 From this one can judge whether thereis much truth in the Socialist-Revolutionaries’ words whenthey assert “we do not at all count” on the well-to-dopeasants but only on the “labouring sections exclusively”. 
 Deduction No. 
 3: “The peasant already has land, and in most cases on the basis of equalitarian land distribution—what we need is that this labour tenure should be carriedthrough to the end ... and culminate in collective agricul-tural production through the development of co-operativesof every kind. 
” Scratch a Socialist-Revolutionary and you find Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
! 76 When it came to action, all the old prej-udices of Narodism, which had safely preserved themselvesbehind shifty phrasing, crept to the surface at once. 
 Stateownership of the land—the completion by the state ofthe transference of the land to the peasantry—the villagecommune—co-operatives—collectivism—in this magnificent scheme of Messrs. 
 Sazonov, Yuzov, N. 
—on, 77 the Socialist-Revolutionaries, Hofstetter, Totomiants, and so on, andso forth—in this scheme a mere trifle is lacking. 
 It takesaccount neither of developing capitalism, nor of theclass struggle. 
 But then how could this trifle enterthe minds of people whose entire ideological luggage consists of Narodnik rags and smart patches of fashionable *A Russian saying. 
— Ed. 
 criticism? Did not Mr. 
 Bulgakov himself say that there is no place for the class struggle in the countryside? Will the replacement of the class struggle by “co-operatives of every kind” fail to satisfy both the liberals and the“critics”, and in general all those to whom socialism is nomore than a traditional label? And is it not possible to tryto soothe naïve people with the assurance: “Of course, anyidealisation of the village commune is alien to us”, although right next to this assurance you read some colossal bombast about the “colossal organisation of the mir peasants”, then bombast that “in certain respects no other class in Russiais so impelled towards a purely [!] political struggle as thepeasantry”, that peasant self-determination (!) is far broaderin scope and in competence than that of the Zemstvo, that this combination of “broad” ... (up to the very boundary of the village?) ... “independent activity” with an absenceof the “most elementary civic rights” “seems to have beendeliberately designed for the purpose of ... rousing andexercising [!] political instincts and habits of social strug-gle”. 
 If you don’t like all this, you don’t have to listen, but.... 
 “One has to be blind not to see how much easier it is to pass to the idea of socialising the land from the tradi-tions of communal land tenure. 
” Is it not the other wayround, gentlemen? Are not those people hopelessly deafand blind who to this very day do not know that it is pre-cisely the medieval seclusion of the semi-serf commune, which splits the peasantry into tiny unions and binds the rural proletariat hand and foot, that maintains the tradi-tions of stagnation, oppression, and barbarism? Are younot defeating your own purpose by recognising the useful-ness of outside employment, which has already destroyedby three-quarters the much-vaunted traditions of equalitar-ian land tenure in the commune, and reduced these tradi-tions to meddling by the police? The minimum programme of the Socialist Revolution-aries, based as it is on the theory we have just analysed,is a real curiosity. 
 This “programme” includes two items:1) “socialisation of the land, i. 
e. 
, its conversion into the property of the whole of society, to be used by the working people”; 2) “the development among the peasantry of allpossible types of public associations and economic co-operatives ... [for a “purely” political struggle?] ... for the grad-ual emancipation of the peasantry from the sway of money capital ... [and subjugation to industrial?] ... and for the preparation of collective agricultural production of thefuture. 
” Just as the sun is reflected in a drop of water, so isthe entire spirit of the present-day “Social-Revolutionarism”reflected in these two items. 
 In theory, revolutionary phrase-mongering instead of a considered and integral system of views; in practice—helpless snatching at this or that modish petty expedient instead of participation in the class strug-gle—that is all they have to show. 
 We must admit that ithas required rare civic courage to place socialisation ofthe land alongside of co-operation in a minimum programme. 
 Their minimum programme: Babeuf, on the one hand, and Mr. 
 Levitsky, on the other. 
 78 This is inimitable. 
 If it were possible to take this programme seriously, we should have to say that, in deceiving themselves with grand-iloquent words, the Socialist-Revolutionaries are alsodeceiving the peasants. 
 It is deception to assert that “co-operatives of every kind” play a revolutionary role in present-day society and prepare the way for collectivism rather than strengthen the rural bourgeoisie. 
 It is decep-tion to assert that socialisation of the land can be placedbefore the “ peasantry ” as a “minimum”, as something just as close at hand as the establishment of co-operatives. 
 Anysocialist could explain to our Socialist-Revolutionaries that today the abolition of private ownership of land can only be the immediate prelude to its abolition in general;that the mere transfer of the land “to be used by the workingpeople” would still not satisfy the proletariat, since mil-lions and tens of millions of ruined peasants are no longerable to work the land, even if they had it. 
 And to supply these ruined millions with implements, cattle, etc. 
, would amount to the socialisation of all the means of productionand would require a socialist revolution of the proletariatand not a peasant movement against the remnants of the serf-owning system. 
 The Socialist-Revolutionaries are confusingsocialisation of the land with bourgeois nationalisation of the land. 
 Speaking in the abstract, the latter is conceivable on the basis of capitalism too, without abolishing wage-labour. 
 But the very example of these same Socialist-Revo-lutionaries is vivid confirmation of the truth that to ad-vance the demand for nationalisation of the land in a police state is tantamount to obscuring the only revolutionary prin-ciple, that of the class struggle, and bringing grist to themill of every kind of bureaucracy. 
 Not only that. 
 The Socialist-Revolutionaries descend to outright reaction when they rise up against the demandof our draft programme for the “annulment of all laws restricting the peasant in the free disposal of his land”. 
 For the sake of the Narodnik prejudice about the “communeprinciple” and the “equalitarian principle” they deny tothe peasant such a “most elementary civic right” as theright freely to dispose of his land; they complacently shuttheir eyes to the fact that the village commune of today is hemmed in by its social-estate reality; they become cham-pions of the police interdictions established and supportedby the “state” ... of the rural superintendents! We believethat not only Mr. 
 Levitsky but Mr. 
 Pobedonostsev 79 too will not be very much alarmed over the demand forsocialisation of the land for the purpose of establishing equalitarian land tenure, once this demand is put forth as a minimum demand alongside of which such thingsfigure as co-operatives and the defence of the police systemof keeping the muzhik tied down to the official allotmentwhich supports him. 
 Let the agrarian programme of the Socialist-Revolution-aries serve as a lesson and a warning to all socialists, a glar-ing example of what results from an absence of ideologyand principles, which some unthinking people call freedomfrom dogma. 
 When it came to action, the Socialist-Revolutionaries did not reveal even a single of the threeconditions essential for the elaboration of a consistent socialist programme: a clear idea of the ultimate aim; a correct understanding of the path leading to that aim;an accurate conception of the true state of affairs at thegiven moment or of the immediate tasks of that moment. 
They simply obscured the ultimate aim of socialism by con-fusing socialisation of the land with bourgeois nationalisa-tion and by confusing the primitive peasant idea about small-scale equalitarian land tenure with the doctrine ofmodern socialism on the conversion of all means of production into public property and the organisation of socialist pro-duction. 
 Their conception of the path leading to socialism is peerlessly characterised by their substitution of the development of co-operatives for the class struggle. 
 Intheir estimation of the present stage in the agrarian evo-lution of Russia, they have forgotten a trifle: the remnantsof serf-ownership, which weigh so heavily on our country-side. 
 The famous trinity which reflects their theoretical views—the intelligentsia, the proletariat, and the peasantry—has its complement in the no less famousthree-point “programme”—socialisation of the land, co-op-eratives, and attachment to the allotment. 
 Compare this with Iskra ’s programme, which indicates to the entire militant proletariat one ultimate aim, with-out reducing it to a “minimum”, without debasing it so as to adapt it to the ideas of certain backward sections ofthe proletariat or of the small producers. 
 The road lead-ing to this aim is the same in town and countryside—theclass struggle of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie. 
But besides this class struggle, another struggle is going on in our countryside: the struggle of the entire peasantry against the remnants of serf-ownership. 
 And in this struggle the party of the proletariat promises its support to theentire peasantry and strives to provide its revolutionary ardour with a real objective, and guide its uprising againstits real enemy, considering it dishonest and unworthy to treat the muzhik as though he were under tutelage or to conceal from him the fact that at present and immediately he canachieve only the complete eradication of all traces and rem-nants of the serf-owning system, and only clear the way forthe broader and more difficult struggle of the entire proletar-iat against the whole of bourgeois society.

 24, September 1, 1902 to the Iskra text A LETTER TO THE MOSCOW COMMITTEE Dear Comrades, We have received your letter expressing your gratitude to the author of What Is to Be Done? and informing us of the decision to allocate 20 per cent * to Iskra . 
 I thank you heartily for this expression of sympathy and solidarity. 
It is all the more valuable for an author of illegal publi-cations because of the fact that in his work he is complete-ly cut off from his readers. 
 Each exchange of ideas, eachreport of the impression any article or pamphlet produces on the various groups of readers is of particular impor-tance to us, and we shall be very grateful, not only for let-ters dealing with the work in the strict sense of the word,not only for contributions to the press, but also for let-ters which make the author feel that he is not cut off fromthe reader. 
 We published your decision to credit 20 per cent to Iskra in No. 
 22 of Iskra . 
 However, we did not venture to publish your thanks to Lenin, since for one thing you men-tioned that separately, without saying that you would liketo see it in print. 
 And for another, the wording of yourmessage of thanks did not seem suitable for the press. 
 But please do not think we attach no importance to publication of the committees’ declarations on their solidarity withcertain views. 
 On the contrary, this is of special impor-tance , particularly now when all of us are thinking of the unification of revolutionary Social-Democracy. 
 It would behighly desirable for the Moscow Committee to express its solidarity with my book in the form of a statement , which *I. 
e. 
, of the Moscow Party Committee’s fund. 
— Ed. 
 would immediately appear in Iskra . 
 It is high time that the committees came out with an open announcement of their Party stand, breaking with those tactics of tacit agree-ment which prevailed in the “third period”. 
 This is thegeneral argument in favour of an open declaration. 
 In par-ticular, I, for example, have been accused in the press (by the Borba group, in its Listok *) of wanting to turn the Edi-torial Board of Iskra into the Russian Central Committee, of wanting to “order” “agents” about, etc. 
 This is downright distortion of what is said in What Is to Be Done? , but I have no desire to keep on reiterating in the press: “you aredistorting”. 
 Those who should begin to speak up are, I think,the functionaries in Russia, who know very well that the “orders” of Iskra go no further than advice and an expres-sion of opinion, and who see that the organisational ideas propounded in What Is to Be Done? reflect the vitally urgent and burning question of the actual movement. 
 I think that these functionaries should themselves demand to be heardand loudly declare how they regard this question, how their experience in work leads them to agree with our views on the organisational tasks. 
 We understand, and naturally could understand, your expression of gratitude for What Is to Be Done? only in the sense that this book has provided you with answers toyour own questions , that through first-hand acquaintance with the movement you have yourselves arrived at the con-viction that bolder, more widespread, more unified , and more centralised work is needed, more closely consolidated abouta single, central newspaper—a conviction which is also setforth in this book. 
 And this being so, once you have real-ly become convinced of this, it is desirable that the commit-tee should say so openly and emphatically, urging the other committees to work together with it in the same direction, following the same “line”, setting itself the sameimmediate tasks with regard to Party organisation. 
 We hope, comrades, that you will find it possible to read this letter to a general meeting of the whole commit-tee, and will inform us of your decision on the questions indicated. 
 (In parenthesis, let me add that the St. 
 Peters-*Literally, a one-sheet newspaper. 
— Ed. 
 burg Committee has also sent us an expression of solidarity, and is now considering a similar statement. 
) Did you have enough copies of What Is to Be Done? ? Have the workers read it and what is their reaction? I warmly shake the hands of all the comrades, and wish them full success. 
 Yours, Lenin Written on August 11 (24), 1902 First published in 1922 Published according in P. 
 N. 
 Lepeshinsky’s book to the manuscript At the Turning-Point PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION OF THE PAMPHLET , THE TASKS OF THE RUSSIAN SOCIAL-DEMOCRATS Exactly five years have passed since the writing of the present pamphlet, which is now appearing in its second edition to meet our agitational requirements. 
 In this briefperiod such tremendous progress has been made by ouryoung working-class movement and such profound changeshave taken place in the position of Russian Social-Democra-cy and in its strength that it may perhaps appear strange that the need should arise for an old pamphlet simply to be republished. 
 Can it be that in 1902 the “tasks of theRussian Social-Democrats” have not changed in the least ascompared with 1897? Has, then, the author himself, who atthat time summed up what was still the “first experience”of his Party activity, gone no step further in his views on this score? These (or similar) questions will probably arise in the mind of many a reader, and to answer them we must re-fer to the pamphlet, What Is to Be Done? , and supplement some of the remarks made there. 
 This reference is necessaryso as to show how the author presented his views on Social-Democracy’s present-day tasks, and supplement what is said there (pp. 
 31-32, 121, 138 *) about conditions obtaining when the pamphlet, which is now republished, was beingwritten, and about its relation to that particular “period” *See present edition, Vol. 
 5. 
— Ed. 
 /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR in the development of Russian Social-Democracy. 
 In all, I named four such periods in the above-mentioned pamphlet (What Is to Be Done? ), the last of which referred “to the sphere of the present and, partly, of the future”; the thirdperiod was termed that of the domination (or, at least, thewidespread) of the “economist” trend, beginning with 1897-98;the second period was the name given to the years 1894-98,and the first to the years 1884-94. 
 In the second period, in contrast to the third, we see no disagreements among the So-cial-Democrats themselves. 
 At that time Social-Democ-racy was ideologically united, and it was then that an attemptwas made to achieve the same unity in practice, in organi-sation (the formation of the Russian Social-DemocraticLabour Party). 
 At that time the main attention of the So-cial-Democrats was centred not on clearing up and deciding various internal Party questions (as was the case in the thirdperiod), but on the ideological struggle against the opponentsof Social-Democracy, on the one hand, and on the development of practical Party work, on the other. 
 There was no such antagonism between the theory and the practice of the Social-Democrats as existed in the period of “economism”. 
 The pamphlet in question reflects the specific features of the then situation and “tasks” of Social-Democracy. 
 Itcalls for deeper and more widespread practical work, seeingno “obstacles” whatever to this in lack of clarity on any of the general views, principles, or theories, seeing no difficulty (at that time there was none) in combining thepolitical struggle with the economic. 
 It addresses itsexplanations of principles to adherents of the NarodnayaVolya and the Narodnoye Pravo, 80 who are opposed to So-cial-Democracy, in an endeavour to dispel the misunder-standings and prejudices which keep them away from the new movement. 
 So, at the present time, when the “economist” period is evidently coming to an end, the Social-Democrats’ stand isagain the same as it was five years ago. 
 Of course, thetasks now confronting us are incomparably more complicated, as a result of the immense growth of the movement during this time, but the principal features of the presentreproduce, on a broader base and on a larger scale, the specific features of the “second” period. 
 The variance between our theory, programme, tactical tasks, and practical activities is disappearing in proportion to the disappear-ance of “economism”. 
 We can and must boldly call again fordeeper and more widespread practical work, since the theo-retical premises for this work have already been createdto a large extent. 
 We must again devote particular atten-tion to non-Social-Democratic illegal trends in Russia, and here we are again confronted with trends which in essence are the very same as those of the first half of the 1890s—onlymuch more developed, organised, and “mature”. 
 While discarding their old vestments, the adherents of the Narodnaya Volya have transformed themselves into “So-cialist-Revolutionaries”, indicating, as it were, by this very name that they have stopped in mid-stream. 
 They have broken away from the old (“Russian” socialism), but have notyet adhered to the new (Social-Democracy). 
 The only theoryof revolutionary socialism known to contemporary mankind,i. 
e. 
, Marxism, has been relegated by them to the archiveson the basis of bourgeois (“Socialists”!) and opportunist (“Revolutionaries”!) criticism. 
 In practice an absence of ideology and principles leads them to “revolutionary adven-turism”, which finds expression in a number of ways; theirendeavours to place on a par such social sections and classesas the intelligentsia, the proletariat, and the peasantry; theirnoisy advocacy of “systematic” terrorism; their remarkable agrarian minimum programme (socialisation of the land, co-operatives, and attachment to the allotment.

 9 of Sozialistische Monatshefte82), and much else with which we shall most probably have to deal more than once. 
 In Russia there are still so many social elements and conditions fostering the instability of theintellectuals, evoking in radically-minded individuals adesire to combine the outmoded and outworn with thelifeless vogue of the day, and hindering their makingcommon cause with the proletariat and its class struggle, that the Russian Social-Democrats will have yet to reckon *See pp. 
 184-205 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 with a trend or trends similar to that of the “Socialist-Revo-lutionaries” until the time comes when capitalist evolution and the sharpening of class contradictions will cut the ground from under their feet. 
 The Narodnoye Pravo followers, who in 1897 were at least just as vague (see below, pp. 
 20-22 *) as the present-day Socialist-Revolutionaries, very quickly disappeared fromthe scene as a consequence of this. 
 But their “sober” idea— that of completely separating from socialism the demand for political liberty—has not died, and could not have died, forin Russia liberal democratic trends are very strong and areconstantly becoming stronger among the most diverse sec-tions of the big and petty bourgeoisie. 
 For this reason theliberal Osvobozhdeniye , which wants to group around itself the representatives of the bourgeois opposition in Russia, has become the legitimate heir of the Narodnoye Pravo, andits definite, consistent, and mature continuator. 
 And justas the withering and decay of the old, pre-Reform Russia,the patriarchal peasantry, and the old type of intelligentsia,who can be equally enthusiastic over the village commune, agricultural co-operatives, and “elusive” terrorism, are inevitable, so too is it inevitable for the propertied classesof capitalist Russia, the bourgeoisie, and the petty bour-geoisie, to grow and mature, with their sober liberalism,which is beginning to realise that it does not pay to main-tain a dull-witted, barbarian, and costly autocratic govern-ment that offers no defence against socialism—with their demand for European forms of class struggle and class domi-nation, with their innate (in the period of the awakeningand growth of the proletariat) ambition to conceal theirbourgeois class interests by denying the class struggle ingeneral. 
 We thus have reason to be grateful to the liberal land-owning gentry who are endeavouring to found a “Zemstvoconstitutional party”. 
 Let us first begin with the leastimportant thing: we are grateful to them for removingMr. 
 Struve from Russian Social-Democracy, completing hismetamorphosis from a quasi-Marxist into a liberal, helping us by a living example to demonstrate to one and all the real *See present edition, Vol. 
 2, pp. 
 344-45. 
— Ed. 
 meaning of Bernsteinism in general and of Russian Bernstein-ism in particular. 
 Secondly, by striving to turn diverse sec-tions of the Russian bourgeoisie into conscious liberals, Osvobozhdeniye will help us to hasten the conversion of more and more masses of workers into conscious social-ists. 
 There has been so much rambling, liberal-Narodnikquasi-socialism in our country that the new liberal trend isclearly a step forward in comparison. 
 It will now be a simple matter to give the workers a vivid demonstration of the Russian liberal and democratic bourgeoisie, to show theneed for an independent political party of the workingclass that would be part of international Social-Democ-racy; it will now be a simple matter to call on theintellectuals to make their stand absolutely clear: liberalism or Social-Democracy; half-way theories and trends will very quickly be ground down between the mill-stones of these two growing and mounting “opposites”. 
Thirdly, and this of course is most important, we shallbe grateful to the liberals if through their opposition they will undermine the alliance between the autocracy and certain sections of the bourgeoisie and intelligentsia. 
 We say “if” because by flirting with the autocracy, extollingpeaceful cultural work, and by their war against “tenden-tious” revolutionaries, etc. 
, the liberals are underminingnot so much the autocracy, as the struggle against theautocracy. 
 By steadily and uncompromisingly exposing all the half-heartedness of the liberals, all their attempts to flirt with the government, we shall be nullifying the effectsof this treacherous aspect of the liberal-bourgeois gentle-men’s political activity and paralysing their left handswhile ensuring the greatest results from the work of theirright hands. 
 Thus, both the Narodnaya Volya and the Narodnoye Pravo have made great strides in developing, defining, andgiving shape to their actual aspirations and their actualnature. 
 The struggle which in the first half of the 1890s tookplace among narrow circles of revolutionary youth is nowreviving as a decisive struggle of mature political trends and real political parties. 
 In view of this, the new edition of the Tasks may per-haps prove useful also because it will remind the Party’s young members of its recent past, will show how the Social-Democrats came to occupy that position among the other trends which has only now become fully defined, and will help give a clearer and more distinct picture of the essen-tially identical but more complex “tasks” of the present. 
 The Social-Democrats are now faced with the urgent task of putting an end to all dissension and wavering intheir midst, of closing their ranks, and merging organisa-tionally under the banner of revolutionary Marxism, of con-centrating all their efforts so as to unite all Social-Demo-crats engaged in practical work, extend and deepen theiractivity, while at the same time devoting serious attentionto explaining to the broadest possible masses of intellectualsand workers the real significance of the two above-mentioned trends, with which Social-Democracy has long had to reckon. 
 August 1902. 
 First published in December 1902 Published according in the pamphlet issued by the League to the text in the of Russian Social-Democracy Abroad pamphlet THE DRAFT OF A NEW LAW ON STRIKES We have come into possession of a new confidential document—the memorandum of the Ministry of Finance “On a revision of articles in the law which make strikes and breaches of contract of hire punishable, and on the desirabil-ity of instituting workers’ organisations for purposes ofmutual aid”. 
 In view of the length of this memorandum andthe need to acquaint the broadest possible sections of theworking class with it, we are publishing it as a separate pamphlet. 
 83 At present, however, we shall give a brief review of the contents of this interesting document andpoint out its importance. 
 The memorandum begins with a short survey of the his-tory of our factory legislation, mentioning the Laws ofJune 3, 1886 and June 2, 1897, 84 and then proceeds to the question of the abolition of criminal liability for leaving employment and for striking. 
 The Ministry of Finance isof the opinion that the threat of arrest or imprisonmentfor a worker’s leaving work without permission or for anumber of workers downing tools by agreement among them-selves, fails in its purpose. 
 Experience has shown that this does not ensure the maintenance of public order; this threat merely embitters the workers, convincing them of theinjustice of the law. 
 The enforcement of these laws is verydifficult “in view of the extreme burdensomeness of insti-tuting hundreds and sometimes thousands of proceedings”if every worker who leaves his job is to be tried, and also in view of the fact that it is unprofitable for the factory owner to lose workers if the latter are imprisoned for going onstrike. 
 Making strikes a criminal offence leads to inordinately zealous interference by the police, which does more harm than good, bringing the employers more difficulties and trouble than relief. 
 The memorandum proposes the com-plete abolition of the individual worker’s liability for leav-ing a factory of his own accord, or for participating in peace-able strikes (unattended by violence or breaches of publiclaw and order, etc. 
). 
 Following the example of legislationabroad, penalties should be imposed only for “violence, threats, or defamation [!] practised by any employer or worker against the person or property of a third personwith the object of compelling the latter, despite his freeand lawful intentions, to work or to abstain from working”on certain terms. 
 In other words, instead of criminal liabil-ity for participation in strikes the proposal is to make it a crime to interfere with “persons desiring to work”. 
 As to the mutual aid societies, the Ministry of Finance complains of arbitrariness on the part of the administrativeauthorities (which, it claims, is particularly noticeablein Moscow where the Society of Mechanics 85 even claimed the right to “mediate” between workers and management), and demands legislative enactment of proper regulations for such societies and assistance in their organisation. 
 Thus, the general spirit of the new memorandum of the Ministry of Finance is undoubtedly liberal, and its mainpoint is the proposal to abolish criminal liability forparticipation in strikes. 
 We shall not analyse the contents of the entire “Bill” in detail here (it will be more conve-nient to do so after the memorandum has been publishedin full), but shall merely call the reader’s attention to thenature and significance of this liberalism. 
 The proposal togive the workers a certain right to strike and to organiseis nothing new, not only in our liberal publicist writ-ings but even in projects coming from official govern-ment commissions. 
 In the early sixties, the StackelbergCommission, which revised factory and artisan regulations,proposed that factory courts elected from among the work-ers and the employers be set up and that some freedomof organisation be granted the workers. 
 In the eighties the commission charged with drafting a new criminal code proposed the abolition of criminal liability for participa-tion in strikes. 
 However, the present draft of the Ministry of Finance differs substantially from the earlier projects, and this difference will remain an extremely important sign of the times even if the proposed new draft is pigeon-holed like all others before it. 
 This essential difference consists inthe fact that the new draft rests on an incomparably sounderfoundation; in it you sense, not only the voice of a few progres-sive theorists and ideologists of the bourgeoisie, but thevoice of an entire section of practical industrialists. 
 This is no longer the liberalism of “humane” government officials and professors alone; it is the home-bred, native liberalismof the Moscow merchants and manufacturers. 
 Let me sayfrankly that this fact fills my heart with a lofty patrioticpride: the twopenny-halfpenny liberalism of the merchantmeans much more than the shilling liberalism of the govern-ment official. 
 And what is most interesting in the memoran-dum is not the nauseating talk about freedom of contract andthe interests of the state, but the practical considerationsof the manufacturers, which break right through the tradi-tional juridical arguments. 
 This is intolerable! We’re fed up! Keep out of it!— is what the Russian manufacturer is saying to the Russian police through the medium of the author of the ministerialmemorandum. 
 Just listen indeed to the following line ofreasoning: “To the police authorities, who find support in the vague-ness and ambiguity of the existing law, every strike comes not as a natural economic phenomenon, but invari-ably as a breach of public law and order. 
 If, however, acalmer attitude existed with regard to stoppages of workat factories, and strikes were not made synonymous withbreaches of public order, it would be much easier to ascer-tain the true causes of such, to separate lawful and justifiable grounds from those that are unlawful and untenable and to take the necessary steps towards peaceful agreementbetween the two parties. 
 Given a more normal state of affairssuch as this, restrictive and repressive measures would beresorted to only when disorder was patently in evidence. 
”The police do not go into the reasons for a strike; they are concerned solely with cutting it short, to which end they resort to one of two methods: either they force the workers(by arrests, deportation, and other measures “up to and in-cluding the use of armed force”) to return to work, or they prompt the employers to make concessions. 
 “It cannot be said that either of these methods suits” Messrs. 
 the Manu-facturers: the former “embitters the workers”, the latter“confirms the workers in the extremely harmful belief thata strike is the surest way of getting what they want in everycase”. 
 “The history of strikes during the last decadeaffords many illustrations of the harm resulting from the efforts to suppress the resulting complications rapidly and at any cost. 
 Hurriedly made arrests have at times soincensed workers who were completely calm until then thatCossacks had to be brought into action, and after that ofcourse any satisfaction even of the legitimate demandsof the strikers was out of the question. 
 On the other hand, cases of prompt satisfaction of the workers’ unlawful demands by means of pressure upon the manufacturers didnot fail to evoke similar strikes in other industrial enter-prises where it became necessary to resort to military forcerather than to a system of concessions, which is sometimesentirely incomprehensible to the workers and strengthens their conviction that the authorities are unjust and despot-ic towards them.... 
” That the police should ever satisfyeven unlawful demands of the workers by means of pressureupon the manufacturers—that of course is a fancy of theMessrs. 
 the Capitalists, who want to say that in some casesthey themselves, after some bargaining with the strikers, would concede less than they have to concede under the pres-sure of the grim prospect of “breaches of state law and order”. 
The memorandum has a dig at the Ministry of the Interior,which in its circular letter of August 12, 1897, “issued withoutagreement with the Ministry of Finance” (that is where thecrux of the matter lies!), prescribes both arrest and deporta-tion in every strike and demands that every case connected with strikes be dealt with as required by the emergencyregulations. 
 “The higher administrative authorities,” contin-ues the memorandum, setting forth the complaints of themanufacturers, “go still further [than the law] and flatlyregard all [italics in the original] cases of strikes as matters of state importance.... 
 Actually, however, every strike (of course if not accompanied by violence) is a purely economicphenomenon, which is quite natural and in no way jeopard-dises public law and order. 
 In these cases law and order should be maintained in the same way as during popu-lar festivities, celebrations, performances, and like occa-sions. 
” This is the language of genuine Manchester Liberals, who proclaim that the struggle between capital and labouris a purely natural phenomenon, who with remarkable frank-ness put on a par “trade in commodities” and “trade in labour” (elsewhere in the memorandum), demand non-interference by the state, and assign to this state the role ofnight (and day) watchman. 
 And, what is of particular impor-tance, the Russian manufacturers have been compelled toadopt this liberal standpoint by none other than our workers. 
The working-class movement has spread so greatly that strikes have really become “natural economic phenomena”. 
 The workers’ struggle has assumed such stubborn formsthat interference by the police state, which prohibits allmanifestations of this struggle, has really begun to proveharmful, not only to the workers (to whom it has, of course,never brought anything but harm), but even to the manufac-turers themselves, on whose behalf this interference was prac-tised. 
 The workers actually deprived the police prohibi-tions of all force, but the police continued (and in an auto-cratic state could not but continue) to interfere and, feelingtheir impotence, kept going from side to side: from armedforce to concessions, from savage reprisals to blandishments. 
 The less effective police intervention proved, the more keenly did the manufacturers feel the arbitrariness of the police, the more inclined they were to believe that it did not pay them to support this arbitrariness. 
 The conflict betweena certain section of the big industrialists and the all-power-full police became more and more intense, assuming partic-ularly acute forms in Moscow, where the system of flirt-ing with the workers had flourished most luxuriantly. 
 Thememorandum openly complains of the Moscow authorities,who were carrying on a dangerous game with workers’ con-ferences and the workers’ mutual aid society in the engi-neering industry. 
 In order to decoy the workers it became necessary to grant the council of this society a certain right of mediation—and the manufacturers immediately began tokick. 
 “At first this council,” the memorandum says at their dictation, “applied to the Factory Inspectorate, but, seeing that the latter did not recognise its right to act as mediator, a role which it had assumed on its own, it began to turn to the Chief of Police, who not only accepts the ten-dered statements, but acts on them in due course, thus sanc-tioning the rights which the council has arrogated to itself. 
”The manufacturers are protesting against particular admin-istrative decrees and demand the legislative enactment of a new system. 
 True, the manufacturers’ liberalism has not ventured so far beyond the extremely narrow limits of their specificinterests; their hostility to police arbitrariness is limitedto individual cases of police excesses which are not to theiradvantage, and is not levelled against the mainstays of bureaucratic despotism. 
 But, by aggravating the class antagonisms in the capitalist countries, the economic devel-opment of Russia and of the whole world will foster thegrowth of this hostility, provide greater grounds for it,and intensify it. 
 The proletariat’s strength lies preciselyin the growth of its numbers and its solidarity as a result of the very process of economic development, while the interests of the big and petty bourgeoisie become moreand more scattered and divided. 
 To take into account this“natural” advantage of the proletariat, the Social-Democratsmust closely watch all clashes of interests among the rul-ing classes, using these clashes, not only in order to gain practical advantages for one section or another of the work-ing class, but also for the purpose of enlightening the en-tire working class, for the purpose of deriving a useful lessonfrom each new social and political incident. 
 The practical advantage which the workers stand to gain from the revision of the law proposed by the liberal manufacturers is too obvious to be dwelt on at length. 
 It is an undoubted concession to a growing force, an aban-donment by the enemy of one of his positions, whichthe revolutionary proletariat has practically capturedalready and which the more far-seeing leaders of the hostilearmy no longer care to defend. 
 Of course, this is no big con-cession: first of all, it is ridiculous even to think that real freedom, the right to strike, is possible without politicalliberty. 
 The police still retain the right to make arrests and to deport without trial, and will retain that right so long as the autocracy continues to exist. 
 And the retention of this right means preservation of nine-tenths of the police interference, the outrages, and the high-handedness,which are beginning to disgust even the manufacturers. 
Secondly, even in the narrow sphere of factory legislationitself, the Ministry of Finance is taking a very timid stepforward, copying the German Bill which the German work-ers have dubbed the “Hard Labour” Bill, 86 and preserving special penalties “for violence, threats, or defamation” in connection with the contract of hire, as if general penal laws covering these offences did not exist! But the Russian work-ers will know how to utilise even this small concession soas to strengthen their positions, to intensify and extend their great struggle for the emancipation of working humanity from wage slavery. 
 As to the useful lesson taught us by the new memoran-dum, we must note primarily that the protest of the manu-facturers against the medieval strike law affords us a smalland particular example of the general incompatibility of in-terests between the developing bourgeoisie and moribund absolutism. 
 This should give food for thought to thosepeople who (like the Socialist-Revolutionaries) have hither-to timidly shut their eyes to the elements of bourgeois oppo-sition in Russia and who continue to reiterate as of old thatthe “interests” (in general!) of the Russian bourgeoisie are satisfied. 
 It turns out that police arbitrariness clashes now with some, now with other interests of even those sections ofthe bourgeoisie that are most directly protected by the tsar-ist police and are threatened directly with material loss by any loosening of the fetters placed on the proletariat. 
 It turns out that a real revolutionary movement dis-organises the government, not only directly by the fact that it enlightens, rouses, and unites the exploited masses, butalso indirectly by the fact that it cuts the ground fromunder antiquated laws, destroys the faith in the autocracyeven of those who would seem to be its confederates, increases“family squabbles” among these confederates, and replaces firmness and unity in the camp of the enemy by dissension and wavering. 
 But in order to achieve such results one con-dition is required, which our Socialist-Revolutionaries have never been able to grasp: it is necessary that the movement should be truly revolutionary, i. 
e. 
, that it should rouse to a new life ever broader sections of the really revolutionary class, that it should actually refashion the spiritual and polit-ical make-up of this class, and through it, of all those whocome in contact with it. 
 If the Socialist-Revolutionariesgrasped this truth, they would understand what practicalharm is wrought by their ideological poverty and the unprin-cipledness of their approach to the fundamental problems of socialism; they would understand that it is not the forcesof the government but those of the revolution that aredisorganised by people who preach that against the crowdthe autocracy has its soldiers and against organisations—the police, whereas individual terrorists who remove minis-ters and governors are truly elusive. 
 The new “step” by the executive board of the manufac-turers’ henchmen affords us still another useful lesson. 
 Thislesson is that we must be able to make practical use of anyliberalism, even of the twopenny-halfpenny variety, andthat at the same time we must be on our guard lest this lib-eralism corrupt the masses with its false presentation of questions. 
 An example is Mr. 
 Struve, an interview withwhom we could put under the heading: “How the liberalswant to teach the workers and how the workers should teachthe liberals. 
” In No. 
 4 of Osvobozhdeniye , which has begun publication of the memorandum under analysis, Mr. 
 Struve tells us, among other things, that the new draft is an expres-sion of “statesmanship”, which, he says, will scarcely suc-ceed in breaking through the wall of arbitrariness and sense-lessness. 
 No, Mr. 
 Struve. 
 It was not “statesmanship” thatadvanced the new strike Bill, but the manufacturers. 
 ThisBill has appeared, not because the state “recognised” the basic principles of civil law (the bourgeois “liberty and equality” of employers and workers), but because the abolition ofcriminal liability for participation in strikes has become ad-vantageous to the manufacturers . 
 The juridical formulations and wholly conclusive reasons now assigned by the Ministryof Finance “itself” ( Osvobozhdeniye , No. 
 4, p. 
 50) existed long ago in Russian publications and even in the reports of government commissions, but it all remained buried inoblivion until the captains of industry raised their voices, after the workers had shown them in practice how absurd the old laws were. 
 We stress the decisive importance of the manufacturers’ advantages and interests not because we believe that this diminishes the importance of the govern-ment schemes—on the contrary, we have already stated thatthis raises their importance in our eyes. 
 But the proletar-iat must learn above all to look at things squarely andsoberly in its struggle against the whole of the present-day system, to lay bare the real causes behind “lofty acts of state”, and to expose unremittingly the false and high-sounding bombast about “statesmanship”, etc. 
, to which thesly police officials give utterance deliberately, and thelearned liberals short-sightedly. 
 Further, Mr. 
 Struve advises the workers to be “restrained” in their agitation for the abolition of criminal liability for participation in strikes. 
 “The more restrained it [thisagitation] will be in form,” Mr. 
 Struve preaches, “the great-er its significance will be. 
” The workers should cordiallythank this former socialist for such advice. 
 This is the tra-ditional Molchalin 87 wisdom of the liberals—to preach re-straint at the very time when the government has just begun to waver (on some particular question). 
 More restraint isneeded so as not to hinder implementation of the incipientreform, so as not to raise apprehensions, and to make useof the propitious moment when the first step has already beentaken (a memorandum has been drawn up!) and when some government department’s recognition of the necessity for reforms gives “irrefutable [?] proof both to the governmentand to society [!] of the justice and timeliness” (?) of thesereforms. 
 This is how Mr. 
 Struve reasons with regard to thedraft under discussion, and this is how the Russian liberalshave always reasoned. 
 However this is not how the Social-Democrats reason. 
 Just look, they say, even some manufac-turers have already begun to understand that the Europeanforms of the class struggle are better than Asiatic police tyr-anny. 
 Our stubborn fight has forced even the manufacturersto doubt the omnipotence of the myrmidons of the autocracy. 
Forward, then, more boldly! Spread more widely the glad tidings of irresolution in the enemy camp; take advantage of the slightest sign of wavering on the part of the enemy soas to increase your demands rather than “restrain” them in the Molchalin manner. 
 Against the debt the government owes to the people, they want to pay you one kopek in every hundred rubles. 
 One payment of this kopek in order to demand in louder and louder terms the whole sum, to completelydiscredit the government and prepare our forces to delivera decisive blow at it. 
 Iskra , No. 
 24, September 1, 1902 Published according to the Iskra text A LETTER TO THE EDITORS OF YUZHNY RABOCHY 88 Dear Comrades, Your detailed letter has greatly gladdened us all. 
 Please send us the promised supplement as soon as possible, and write oftener. 
 We hope soon to send one of the comradesto you for more detailed and final talks; meanwhile weshall confine ourselves to the most important points. 
 You are right a thousand times over when you say that we must unite as soon as possible, indeed immediately, in a single all-Russian organisation, whose aim would be to prepare the ground for ideological unity among thecommittees and for the practical, organisational unity ofthe Party. 
 We, for our part, have already taken a numberof fairly important steps in this direction, thanks to the factthat the St. 
 Petersburg Committee has come over fully to the Iskra point of view, published a statement to this effect, and de facto (this, of course, is strictly entre nous *) merged with the Iskra organisation in Russia, and given its members very influential places in the committee’scentral group. 
 If we succeed in getting the same completesolidarity and complete fusion with the South, the actual unification of the Party will be three-quarters on the way to accomplishment. 
 This must be pushed ahead as fast aspossible. 
 We are taking steps immediately, first, to see toit that members of the Iskra organisation in Russia visit you for the purpose of coming to an agreement; second, to estab-lish connections here with Chernyshov. 
 For your part, hurry up the release (or publication in Iskra ) of your statement of *Between us. 
— Ed. 
 principles, fully defining your position in the Party, and take all steps towards actual fusion with the Iskra organisa-tion in Russia. 
 In conclusion, a few words on the questions you have raised. 
 Regarding the peasantry and the agrarian programme, weare not clear on precisely what you find unsatisfactory inour draft agrarian programme and what changes you wouldlike. 
 Let us know this more concretely. 
 Have you seen No. 
 4 of Zarya with the article on the agrarian programme? * I n general, your remarks about the mistakes made by Iskra show how important it is for us to communicate more fre-quently and regularly so as to achieve complete harmony. 
We have so devilishly few forces that only the closest unityof all Social-Democrats can ensure us success in the struggle against both the “adventurers” and the government. 
 And yet we hitherto knew almost nothing about your standpoint,for instance, or about your practical work—is that normal?Besides, is it normal that you, for instance, are now takingsteps on your own to establish permanent transport connec-tions, while we are doing it likewise on our own? (Let us know in greater detail what steps you are taking, how and where, what are the means you have, etc. 
) This same circum-stance, i. 
e. 
, the shortage of forces, should be taken intoaccount in considering the question of a special press organ,of continuing the publication of Yuzhny Rabochy , of chang-ing it to Russky Rabochy . 
 We must weigh all aspects of the matter with the utmost care. 
 Just consider where we are to get the forces for two papers, when we know very wellthat we have not enough even for one. 
 Won’t you be givingSt. 
 Petersburg (the non-Iskra -ist elements in St. 
 Petersburg) a stimulus to publish Rabochaya Mysl also as an “explana-tory”, popular, etc. 
, paper? And this at a time when St. 
 Petersburg is preparing to discontinue Rabochaya Mysl and at last get down to real work on Iskra . 
 Won’t your efforts to arrange regular contributions to Iskra from Russia suffer as a result of your plans—and you know that withoutthis collaboration Iskra cannot become a genuine Party organ; don’t forget either that, except for you, we have prac-tically no one in view for this work. 
 And if the Iskra -ists *See pp. 
 105-48 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 don’t take this in hand, who will do so, and when? Finally, thrash out more thoroughly the question of whether the purposes of explanatory, propagandist, popular literature meant for the “average worker” (as you put it) are com-patible with the purposes of a newspaper. 
 That theremust be literature specially designed for the average workerand the masses is indisputable; but this can be only in theform of leaflets and pamphlets, since it is impossible for a newspaper properly to explain every question to the aver-age worker. 
 For this we must begin from the beginning , with the ABC, and go straight through to the end, carefully andthoroughly examining all aspects of a question. 
 A newspaperwould scarcely be in a position to do this even if it were as-sured of ideal conditions with regard to literary forces. 
 Don’t forget, lastly, that what you do, whether you desire it or not, will be of all-Russian importance, and that all talk,notions, and theories about special papers “for the intelli-gentsia ” and “for the workers ” may play a most pernicious part, not only irrespectively of your desires, but even despiteanything you may do to counteract it personally. 
 After all, there is only a handful like you among the Russian Social-Democrats, while among the mass of the RussianSocial-Democrats there is still a very great deal of narrow-mindedness of all kinds. 
 We do not, of course, intend tolimit ourselves to these cursory remarks on a question ofsuch importance, but we only ask you not to unduly hasten your decision, and to discuss the matter from all angles. 
 We consider it even desirable to preserve a separate group (the Editorial Board of Yuzhny Rabochy ) at least until the Party congress, but this group should not be in a hurrywith its paper.

 1904 Reduced Cover of Lenin’s pamphlet, A Letter to a Comrade on Our Organisational Tasks . 
 1904 Reduced Dear Comrade, It is with pleasure that I accede to your request for a criticism of your draft for the “Organisation of the St. 
Petersburg Revolutionary Party”. 
 (Most likely you meant theorganisation of the work of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party in St. 
 Petersburg. 
) The question you have raised is so important that all members of the St. 
 Peters-burg Committee, and even all Russian Social-Democrats ingeneral, should take part in its discussion. 
 First of all, let me express my complete agreement with your explanation of the unsuitableness of the former (“league type”, as you term it) organisation of the “League”. 
 You refer to the lack of serious training and revolutionaryeducation among the progressive workers, to the so-calledelective system, which Rabocheye Dyelo supporters are cham-pioning so proudly and stubbornly on the grounds of “demo-cratic” principles, and to the workers’ alienation from active work. 
 That precisely is the case: 1) the lack of serious training and revolutionary education (not only among the workers,but among the intellectuals as well), 2) the misplaced andimmoderate application of the elective principle, and 3)the workers’ alienation from active revolutionary work— that is where the main shortcoming of the St. 
 Petersburg organisation and of many other local organisations of ourParty really lies. 
 I fully share your basic view on the organisational tasks, and also subscribe to your organisational plan, so faras I understand its general outlines from your letter. 
 Specifically, I wholly agree with you that special stress should be laid on the tasks connected with the work on anall-Russian scale and with the work of the Party as a whole; in your draft this is expressed in Clause One, which reads: “The newspaper Iskra , which has permanent correspondents among the workers and close contact with the work within the organisation, is the leading centre of the Party (and not only of a committee or a district). 
” I should merely like toremark that the newspaper can and should be the ideological leader of the Party, evolving theoretical truths, tacticalprinciples, general organisational ideas, and the general tasks of the whole Party at any given moment. 
 But only a special central group (let us call it the Central Committee,say) can be the direct practical leader of the movement, maintaining personal connections with all the committees, embracing all the best revolutionary forces among the Rus-sian Social-Democrats, and managing all the general affairs of the Party, such as the distribution of literature, the issuing of leaflets, the allocation of forces, the appointmentof individuals and groups to take charge of special undertak-ings, the preparation of demonstrations and an uprising onan all-Russian scale, etc. 
 Since the strictest secrecy of organ-isation and preservation of continuity of the movement is essential, our Party can and should have two leading centres: a C. 
O. 
 (Central Organ) and a C. 
 C. 
 (Central Commit-tee). 
 The former should be responsible for ideological leader-ship, and the latter for direct and practical leadership. 
Unity of action and the necessary solidarity between thesegroups should be ensured, not only by a single Party pro-gramme, but also by the composition of the two groups (both groups, the C. 
O. 
 and the C. 
C. 
, should be made up of peoplewho are in complete harmony with one another), and by theinstitution of regular and systematic joint conferences. 
Only then will the C. 
O. 
, on the one hand, be placed beyondthe reach of the Russian gendarmes and assured of consisten-cy and continuity, while, on the other hand, the C. 
C. 
 will always be at one with the C. 
O. 
 on all essential matters andhave sufficient freedom to take direct charge of all the prac-tical aspects of the movement. 
 For this reason it would be desirable that Clause One of the Rules (according to your draft) should not only indi-cate which Party organ is recognised as the leading organ (that, of course, is necessary), but should also state that thegiven local organisation sets itself the task of working ac-tively for the creation , support, and consolidation of those central institutions without which our Party cannot exist as a party. 
 Further, in Clause Two, you say that the committee should “direct the local organisation” (perhaps it wouldbe better to say: “all local work and all the local organisa-tions of the Party”; but I shall not dwell on details of formu-lation), and that it should consist of both workers and intellectuals, for to divide them into two committees is harmful. 
 This is absolutely and indubitably correct. 
 Thereshould be only one committee of the Russian Social-Demo-cratic Labour Party, and it should consist of fully convincedSocial-Democrats who devote themselves entirely toSocial-Democratic activities. 
 We should particularly see to it that as many workers as possible become fully class-conscious and professional revolutionaries and members of the commit-tee. 
 * Once there is a single and not a dual committee, the matter of the committee members personally knowing many workers is of particular importance. 
 In order to take the leadin whatever goes on in the workers’ midst, it is necessary to be able to have access to all quarters, to know very many workers, to have all sorts of channels, etc. 
, etc. 
 The committeeshould, therefore, include, as far as possible, all the principalleaders of the working-class movement from among the work-ers themselves; it should direct all aspects of the local move-ment and take charge of all local institutions, forces and means of the Party. 
 You do not say how the committee should be set up—most likely, here too we shall agree withyou that it is scarcely necessary to have special regulationsabout this; how to set up the committee is a matter forthe Social-Democrats on the spot to decide. 
 However, itshould perhaps be pointed out that new members should be added to the committee by decision of a majority (or two-thirds, etc. 
) of its members, and that the committeeshould see to it that its list of contacts is placed in handsthat are reliable (from the revolutionary standpoint) andsafe (in the political sense), and that it prepares candi-*We must try to get on the committee revolutionary workers who have the greatest contacts and the best “reputation” among themass of the workers. 
 date-members in advance. 
 When we have the C. 
O. 
 and the C. 
C. 
, new committees should be set up only with their co-operation and their consent. 
 As far as possible, the com-mittees should not have very many members (so that theyconsist of well-educated people, each well versed in the tech-nique of his particular branch of revolutionary activity),but at the same time they should include a sufficient num-ber to take charge of all aspects of the work, and to ensure full representation and binding decisions. 
 Should it hap-pen that the number of members is fairly large and that itis hazardous for them to meet frequently, it might then benecessary to select from the committee a special and verysmall executive group (consisting of, say, five, or even fewer persons), which should without fail include the secretary and those most capable of giving practical guidance to the work as a whole. 
 It is particularly important that candidate-members be provided for this group so that the workshould not have to stop in case of arrests. 
 The activities ofthe executive group, its membership, etc. 
, should be sub-ject to approval by a general meeting of the committee. 
 Further, after the committee, you propose the following institutions under it: 1) discussion meetings (conferencesof the “best” revolutionaries), 2) district circles with 3) apropagandists’ circle attached to each of these, 4) factorycircles, and 5) “meetings of representatives” of delegates fromthe factory circles of a given district. 
 I fully agree with you that all further institutions (and of these there should be very many and extremely diversified ones, besides thosementioned by you) should be subordinated to the committee,and that it is necessary to have district groups (for the verybig cities) and factory groups (always and everywhere). 
But I do not quite agree with you, it seems, on several de-tails. 
 For instance, with regard to “discussion meetings” I think that these are wholly unnecessary . 
 The “best revo-lutionaries” should all be on the committee, or engaged inspecial work (printing, transport, agitational tours, theorganisation, say, of a passport bureau, or of combat squadsto deal with spies and agents provocateurs , or of groups in the army, etc. 
). 
 “Conferences” will be held in the committee and in each district, in each factory, propagandist, trade (weavers, me-chanics, tanners, etc. 
), student, literary, etc. 
, circle. 
 Why should conferences be made a special institution? Further. 
 You quite justifiably demand that the oppor-tunity to write to Iskra directly should be given to “every-one who wants it”. 
 Only “directly” should not be understoodto mean that “everyone who wants it” should be given accessto the editorial office or its address, but that it should beobligatory to hand over (or forward) to the editors letters from all who so desire . 
 The addresses should, of course, be made known to a fairly wide circle ; however, they should not be given to everyone who wants them, but only to revo-lutionaries who are reliable and known for their ability toobserve the conditions of secrecy—perhaps even not to oneperson in each district, as you suggest, but to several. 
 It is also necessary that all who take part in our work, each and every circle, should have the right to bring their deci-sions, desires and requests to the attention of the committee , as well as of the C. 
O. 
 and C. 
C. 
 If we ensure this, then all conferences of Party functionaries will have the benefit of full information , without instituting anything so cumbersome and contrary to the rules of secrecy as “discussion meetings”. 
 Of course, we should also endeavour to arrange personal conferences of the greatest possible number of all and sundry functionaries—but then here everything hinges on theobservance of secrecy. 
 General meetings and gatherings arepossible in Russia only rarely and by way of exception, and it is necessary to be doubly wary about allowing the “best revolutionaries” to attend these meetings, since it is easierin general for agents provocateurs to get into them and for spies to trail some participant of the meeting. 
 I think thatperhaps it would be better to do as follows: when it is possibleto organise a big (say, 30 to 100 people) general meeting (for instance, in the summer-time in the woods, or in a secret apartment that has been specially secured for this purpose),the committee should send one or two of the “best revolu-tionaries” and make sure that the meeting is attended by the proper people, i. 
e. 
, for example, that invitations shouldbe extended to as many as possible of the reliable members of the factory circles, etc. 
 But these meetings should not officially go on record; they should not be put in theRules, or held regularly; matters should not be arranged in such a way that everyone who attends the meeting knows everyone else there, i. 
e. 
, knows that everyone is a “repre-sentative” of a circle, etc. 
; that is why I am opposed, not only to “discussion meetings” but also to “meetings of repre-sentatives”. 
 In place of these two institutions I wouldpropose a rule to the following effect. 
 The committee mustsee to the organisation of big meetings of as many people aspossible who are practical participants in the movement, and of the workers in general. 
 The time, place, and occasion for the meeting and its composition are to be determined bythe committee, which is responsible for the secret arrange-ment of such affairs. 
 It is self-evident that the organisationof workers’ gatherings of a less formal character at outings,in the woods, etc. 
, is in no way restricted by this. 
 Perhaps it would be even better not to say anything about this in the Rules. 
 Further, as regards the district groups, I fully agree with you that it is one of their most important tasks to organisethe distribution of literature properly. 
 I think the district groups should for the main part act as intermediaries between the committees and the factories, intermediaries and even mostly couriers . 
 Their chief task should be the proper distribution of the literature received from the com-mittee in accordance with the rules of secrecy. 
 This is anextremely important task, for if we secure regular contactbetween a special district group of distributors and all the factories in that district, as well as the largest possible num-ber of workers ’ homes in that district, it will be of enormous value, both for demonstrations and for an uprising. 
 Arrang-ing for and organising the speedy and proper delivery of lit-erature, leaflets, proclamations, etc. 
, training a network ofagents for this purpose, means performing the greater part of the work of preparing for future demonstrations or an uprising. 
 It is too late to start organising the distribution of literatureat a time of unrest, a strike, or turmoil; this work can be builtup only gradually, by making distributions obligatory twice or three times a month. 
 If no newspapers are available,leaflets may and should be distributed, but the distributive machine must in no case be allowed to remain idle. 
 This machine should be brought to such a degree of perfectionas to make it possible to inform and mobilise, so to speak, the whole working-class population of St. 
 Petersburg over-night. 
 Nor is this by any means a Utopian aim, provided there is a systematic transmission of leaflets from the centre to the narrower intermediary circles and from them to thedistributors. 
 In my opinion, the functions of the districtgroups should not be extended beyond the bounds of purelyintermediary and transmission work, or, to put it more accu-rately, they should be extended only with the utmost caution— otherwise this can only increase the risk of discovery and be injurious to the integrity of the work. 
 Of course, confer-ences to discuss all Party questions will take place in the dis-trict circles as well, but decisions on all general questions of the local movement should be made only by the committee. 
The district groups should be permitted to act independent-ly only on questions concerning the technical aspect of transmission and distribution. 
 The composition of the dis-trict groups should be determined by the committee, i. 
e. 
,the committee appoints one or two of its members (or even comrades who are not on the committee) as delegates to thisor that district and instructs them to establish a district group , all the members of which are likewise installed in office, so to speak, by the committee. 
 The district groupis a branch of the committee, deriving its powers only fromthe latter. 
 I now pass on to the question of propagandists’ circles. 
 It is hardly possible to organise such circles separately in every district owing to the scarcity of our propagandist forces, and it is hardly desirable. 
 Propaganda must be car-ried on in one and the same spirit by the whole committee,and it should be strictly centralised. 
 My idea of the matteris therefore as follows: the committee instructs several ofits members to organise a group of propagandists (which will be a branch of the committee or one of the institutions of the committee ). 
 This group, using for the sake of secrecy the services of the district groups, should conduct propa-ganda throughout the town , and in all localities “within the jurisdiction” of the committee. 
 If necessary, this groupmay set up subgroups, and, so to say, entrust certain of its functions to the latter, but all this can be done only with the sanction of the committee, which must always and uncon-ditionally possess the right of detailing its delegate to any group, subgroup, or circle which has any connection at all with the movement. 
 The same pattern of organisation, the same type of branches of the committee or its institutions, should be adopt-ed for all the various groups serving the movement—students’groups in the higher and secondary schools; groups, let ussay, of supporters among government officials; transport,printing, and passport groups; groups for arranging secret meeting places; groups whose job it is to track down spies; groups among the military; groups for supplying arms;groups for the organisation of “financially profitable enter-prises,” for example, etc. 
 The whole art of running a secretorganisation should consist in making use of everything possible , in “giving everyone something to do”, at the same time retaining leadership of the whole movement, not by virtue of having the power, of course, but by virtue ofauthority, energy, greater experience, greater versatility,and greater talent. 
 This remark is made to meet the possibleand usual objection that strict centralisation may alltoo easily ruin the movement if the centre happens t o include an incapable person invested with tremendous power. 
 This is, of course, possible, but it cannot be obviatedby the elective principle and decentralisation, the applica-tion of which is absolutely impermissible to any widedegree and even altogether detrimental to revolutionary workcarried on under an autocracy. 
 Nor can any rules provide means against this; such means can be provided only by measures of “comradely influence”, beginning with the res-olutions of each and every subgroup, followed up by theirappeals to the C. 
O. 
 and the C. 
C. 
, and ending (if the worstcomes to the worst) with the removal of the persons in authority who are absolutely incapable. 
 The committee should endeavour to achieve the greatest possible division of labour, bearing in mind that the various aspects of revolu-tionary work require various abilities, and that sometimesa person who is absolutely useless as an organiser may beinvaluable as an agitator, or that a person who is not goodat strictly secret work may be an excellent propagandist, etc. 
 Incidentally, while on the subject of propagandists, I should like to say a few words in criticism of the usualpractice of overloading this profession with incapable people and thus lowering the level of propaganda. 
 It is sometimes the habit among us to regard every student as a propagan-dist without discrimination, and every youngster demands that he should “be given a circle”, etc. 
 This must be counteredbecause it does a great deal of harm. 
 There are very few propagandists whose principles are invariably consistentand who are really capable (and to become such one mustput in a lot of study and amass experience); such people should therefore be specialised, put wholly on this kind of work, and be given the utmost care. 
 Such persons shoulddeliver several lectures a week and be sent to other townswhen necessary, and, in general, capable propagandistsshould make tours of various towns and cities. 
 But the massof young beginners should be given mainly practical assign-ments, which are somewhat neglected in comparison with the students’ conduct of circles, which is optimisticallycalled “propaganda”. 
 Of course, thorough training is alsorequired for serious practical enterprises; nevertheless, workin this sphere can more easily be found for “beginners” too. 
 Now about the factory circles. 
 These are particularly important to us: the main strength of the movement lies in the organisation of the workers at the large factories, for the large factories (and mills) contain not only the predominantpart of the working class, as regards numbers, but even moreas regards influence, development, and fighting capacity. 
Every factory must be our fortress. 
 For that every “factory” workers’ organisation should be as secret internally as “ramified” externally, i. 
e. 
, in its outward relationships,it should stretch its feelers as far and in as many directionsas any revolutionary organisation. 
 I emphasise that here,too, a group of revolutionary workers should necessarilybe the core, the leader, the “master”. 
 We must break complete-ly with the traditional type of purely labour or purely trade-union Social-Democratic organisation, including the “factory” circles. 
 The factory group, or the factory (mill)committee (to distinguish it from other groups of which thereshould be a great number) should consist of a very smallnumber of revolutionaries , who take their instructions and receive their authority to carry on all Social-Democratic work in the factory directly from the committee . 
 Every mem-ber of the factory committee should regard himself as an agent of the committee, obliged to submit to all its orders and to observe all the “laws and customs” of the “army in the field” which he has joined and from which in time of war he has no right to absent himself without official leave. 
 Thecomposition of the factory committee is therefore a matterof very great importance, and one of the chief duties of thecommittee should be to see to the proper organisation ofthese subcommittees. 
 This is how I picture it: the commit-tee instructs certain of its members (plus, let us say, certain workers who for some reason or other have not been includedin the committee, but who can be very useful by reasonof their experience, knowledge of people, intelligence, andconnections) to organise factory subcommittees everywhere. 
This group consults with the district representatives, arranges for a number of meetings, thoroughly checks candi-date-members of the factory subcommittees, subjects them toclose cross-examination, where necessary puts them to thetest, endeavouring personally to examine and verify thelargest possible number of candidate-members of the sub-committee of the factory in question, and, finally, submits a list of members for each factory circle to the committee for approval, or proposes that authority be given to somedesignated worker to set up, nominate or select a completesubcommittee. 
 In this way, the committee will also deter-mine which of these agents is to maintain contact with itand how the contact is to be maintained (as a general rule, through the district representatives, but this rule may be supplemented and modified). 
 In view of the importance ofthese factory subcommittees, we must see to it as far aspossible that every subcommittee is in possession of an address to which it can direct its communication to the C. 
O. 
and of a repository for its list of contacts in some safe place (i. 
e. 
, that the information required for the immediate re-establishment of the subcommittee in the event of arrestsis transmitted as regularly and as fully as possible to theParty centre, for safekeeping in a place where the Russiangendarmes are unable to get at it). 
 It is a matter of coursethat the transmission of addresses must be determined by the committee at its own discretion and on the basis of the facts at its disposal, and not on the basis of some non-existent right to a “democratic” allocation of these addresses. 
 Finally, it is perhaps not superfluous to mention that it may sometimes be necessary, or more convenient , to confine ourselves to the appointment of one agent from the commit-tee (and an alternate for him) instead of a factory subcom-mittee consisting of several members. 
 As soon as the factorysubcommittee has been formed it should proceed to organ-ise a number of factory groups and circles with diversetasks and varying degrees of secrecy and organisational form, as, for instance, circles for delivering and distributing literature (this is one of the most important functions, whichmust be organised so as to provide us with a real postal ser-vice of our own, so as to possess tried and tested methods,not only for distributing literature, but also for deliveringit to the homes, and so as to provide a definite knowledge of all the workers’ addresses and ways of reaching them); circles for reading illegal literature; groups for trackingdown spies *; circles for giving special guidance to the trade-union movement and the economic struggle; circles ofagitators and propagandists who know how to initiate andto carry on long talks in an absolutely legal way (on machin-ery, inspectors, etc. 
) and so be able to speak safely and pub-licly, to get to know people and see how the land lies, etc. 
 ** The factory subcommittee should endeavour to embracethe whole factory, the largest possible number of the workers,with a network of all kinds of circles (or agents). 
 The successof the subcommittee’s activities should be measured by the abundance of such circles, by their accessibility to touring propagandists and, above all, by the correctness of the reg-ular work done in the distribution of literature and the collection of information and correspondence. 
 *We must get the workers to understand that while the killing of spies, agents provocateurs , and traitors may sometimes, of course, be absolutely unavoidable, it is highly undesirable and mistaken tomake a system of it, and that we must strive to create an organisationwhich will be able to render spies innocuous by exposing them and tracking them down. 
 It is impossible to do away with all spies, butto create an organisation which will ferret them out and educate the working-class masses is both possible and necessary . 
 **We also need combat groups, in which workers who have had military training or who are particularly strong and agile should beenrolled, to act in the event of demonstrations, in arranging escapesfrom prison, etc. 
 To sum up, the general type of organisation, in my opin-ion, should be as follows: a committee should be at the head of the entire local movement, of all the local Social-Democratic activities. 
 From it should stem the institutionsand branches subordinate to it, such as, first, the network of executive agents embracing (as far as possible) the whole working-class mass and organised in the form of district groups and factory (mill) subcommittees. 
 In times of peace this network will be engaged in distributing literature, leaf-lets, proclamations and the secret communications fromthe committee; in times of war it will organise demonstra-tions and similar collective activities. 
 Secondly, the com-mittee will also branch out into circles and groups of allkinds serving the whole movement (propaganda, transport, all kinds of underground activities, etc. 
). 
 All groups, circles, subcommittees, etc. 
, should enjoy the status of committeeinstitutions or branches of a committee. 
 Some of them willopenly declare their wish to join the Russian Social-Demo-cratic Labour Party and, if endorsed by the committee, willjoin the Party, and will assume definite functions (on the instructions of, or in agreement with, the committee), will undertake to obey the orders of the Party organs, receivethe same rights as all Party members, and be regarded asimmediate candidates for membership of the committee,etc. 
 Others will not join the Russian Social-DemocraticLabour Party, and will have the status of circles formed by Party members, or associated with one Party group or another, etc. 
 In all internal matters, members of all these circles are of course on an equal footing, as are all membersof a committee. 
 The only exception will be that the rightof personal contact with the local committee (as well as with the C. 
C. 
 and the C. 
O. 
) will be reserved solely to the person (or persons) appointed for that purpose by the commit-tee. 
 In all other respects, this person will be on an equalfooting with the rest, who will also have the right to presentstatements (but not in person) to the local committee and tothe C. 
C. 
 and C. 
O. 
 It follows that the exception indicated will not at all be an infraction of the principle of equality, but merely a necessary concession to the absolute demandsof secrecy. 
 A member of a committee who fails to transmit a communication of his “own” group to the committee, the C. 
C. 
 or the C. 
O. 
, will be guilty of a direct breach of Party duty. 
 Further, the degree of secrecy and the organisational form of the various circles will depend upon the nature ofthe functions: accordingly, the organisations will be mostvaried (ranging from the “strictest”, narrowest, and mostrestricted type of organisation to the “freest”, broadest, mostloosely constituted, and open type). 
 For instance, strictest secrecy and military discipline must be maintained in the distributing groups. 
 The propagandists’ groups must alsomaintain secrecy, but be under far less military discipline. 
Workers’ groups for reading legal literature, or for organisingdiscussions on trade-union needs and demands call for stillless secrecy, and so on. 
 The distributing groups should belong to the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 and know a certain number of its members and functionaries. 
 The groups for studying labourconditions and drawing up trade-union demands need notnecessarily belong to the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 Groups of students,officers, or office employees engaged in self-education in conjunction with one or two Party members should in some cases not even be aware that these belong to the Party, etc. 
 But in one respect we must absolutely demand the maximum degree of organisation in all these branch groups, namely, that every Party member belonging to such a group is for-mally responsible for the conduct of work in the group andis obliged to take every measure in order that the composi-tion of each of these groups, the whole mechanism of its work, and the content of that work should be known as fully as possible to the C. 
C. 
 and the C. 
O. 
 That is necessary in order that the centre may have a complete picture of the whole movement, that the selection for various Party postsmay be made from the widest possible circle of people; that all groups of a similar nature throughout Russia may learn from one another (through the medium of the cen-tre), and that warning may be given in the event of the ap-pearance of agents provocateurs or suspicious characters— in a word, that is absolutely and vitally necessary in all cases. 
 How is it to be done? By submitting regular reports to the committee, by transmitting to the C. 
O. 
 as much of the contents as possible of as large a number of reports as pos-sible, by arranging that members of the C. 
C. 
 and the local committee visit the various circles, and, finally, by making it obligatory to hand over the list of contacts with these circles, i. 
e. 
, the names and addresses of several members of each circle, for safekeeping (and to the Party bureau of the C. 
O. 
and the C. 
C. 
). 
 Only when reports are submitted and contactstransmitted will it be possible to say of a Party memberbelonging to a given circle that he has done his duty; only thenwill the Party as a whole be in a position to learn from every circle that is carrying on practical work; only then will arrests and dragnets lose their terror for us, for if con-tacts are maintained with the various circles it will alwaysbe easy for a delegate of our C. 
C. 
 to find substitutes imme-diately and have the work resumed. 
 The arrest of a committee will then not destroy the whole machine, but only remove the leaders, who will always have candidates ready. 
 And let it not be said that the transmission of reports andcontacts is impossible because of the need to maintainsecrecy: once there is the desire to do so, it is always, and will always , be possible to hand over (or forward) reports and contacts, so long as we have committees, a C. 
C. 
 or a C. 
O. 
 This brings us to a highly important principle of all Party organisation and all Party activity: while the greatest possible centralisation is necessary with regard to the ideolog-ical and practical leadership of the movement and the revo-lutionary struggle of the proletariat, the greatest possible decentralisation is necessary with regard to keeping the Party centre (and therefore the Party as a whole) informed about the movement, and with regard to responsibility to the Par-ty. 
 The leadership of the movement should be entrusted tothe smallest possible number of the most homogeneous pos-sible groups of professional revolutionaries with great prac-tical experience. 
 Participation in the movement should extend to the greatest possible number of the most diverse and heterogeneous groups of the most varied sections of theproletariat (and other classes of the people). 
 The Party centreshould always have before it, not only exact informationregarding the activities of each of these groups, but alsothe fullest possible information regarding their composi-tion . 
 We must centralise the leadership of the movement. 
 We must also (and for that very reason , since without information centralisation is impossible) as far as possible decentralise responsibility to the Party on the part of its individual members, of every participant in its work, and of every circle belonging to or associated with the Party. 
 This decentralisation is an essential prerequisite of revolu-tionary centralisation and an essential corrective to it . 
 Only when centralisation has been carried through to theend and when we have a C. 
O. 
 and a C. 
C. 
, will it be possi-ble for every group, however small, to communicate with them—and not only communicate with them, but to do so regularly as a result of a system established by years of ex-perience—only then will the possibility of grievousconsequences resulting from an accidentally unfortunatecomposition of a local committee be eliminated. 
 Now thatwe are coming close to actual unity in the Party and to the creation of a real leading centre, we must well remember that this centre will be powerless if we do not at the same time introduce the maximum of decentralisation both with regard to responsibility to the centre and with regard to keepingit informed of all the cogs and wheels of the Party machine. 
This decentralisation is nothing but the reverse side of the division of labour which is generally recognised to be one of the most urgent practical needs of our movement. 
 Noofficial recognition of a given organisation as the leadingbody, no setting-up of a formal C. 
C. 
 will make our move-ment really united, or create an enduring militant Party,if the Party centre continues to be cut off from direct prac-tical work by the local committees of the old type, i. 
e. 
, by committees such as are, on the one hand, made up of aregular jumble of persons, each of whom carries on all andevery kind of work, without devoting himself to some def-inite type of revolutionary work, without assuming respon-sibility for some special duty, without carrying through a piece of work to the end, once it has been undertaken, thoroughly considered and prepared, wasting an enormousamount of time and energy in radicalist noise-making, while,on the other hand, there is a great mass of students’ andworkers’ circles, half of which are altogether unknown tothe committee, while the other half are just as cumbersome, just as lacking in specialisation, just as little given to ac-quiring the experience of professional revolutionaries orto benefiting from the experience of others, just as taken up with endless conferences “about everything”, with elec-tions and with drafting rules, as the committee itself. 
 For the centre to be able to work properly, the local committees must reorganise themselves ; they must become specialised and more “business-like” organisations, achievingreal “perfection” in one or another practical sphere. 
 Forthe centre not only to advise, persuade, and argue (ashas been the case hitherto), but really conduct the orches-tra, it is necessary to know exactly who is playing which fiddle, and where and how; where and how instruction hasbeen or is being received in playing each instrument; whois playing out of tune (when the music begins to jar on theear), and where and why; and who should be transferred, andhow and where to, so that the discord may be remedied, etc. 
 At the present time—this must be said openly—we either know nothing about the real internal work of a committee, except from its proclamations and general correspondence,or we know about it from friends or good acquaintances. 
 Butit is ridiculous to think that a huge Party, which is capableof leading the Russian working-class movement and which is preparing a general onslaught upon the autocracy, can limit itself to this. 
 The number of committee members shouldbe cut down; each of them, wherever possible, should beentrusted with a definite, special and important function,for which he will be held to account; a special, very small,directing centre must be set up; a network of executive agents must be developed, linking the committee with every large factory, carrying on the regular distribution of literatureand giving the centre an exact picture of this distributionand of the entire mechanism of the work; lastly, numerousgroups and circles must be formed, which will undertakevarious functions or unite persons who are close to the Social-Democrats, who help them and are preparing to become Social-Democrats, so that the committee and the centre maybe constantly informed of the activities (and the composi-tion) of these circles—these are the lines along which the St. 
Petersburg, and all the other committees of the Party, shouldbe reorganised; and this is why the question of Rules is of so little importance. 
 I have begun with an analysis of the draft Rules in order to bring out the drift of my proposals more clearly. 
 And as a result it will, I hope, have become clear to the reader that in fact it would perhaps be possible to get along without Rules , substituting for them regular reports about each circle and every aspect of the work. 
 What can one put inthe Rules? The committee guides the work of everyone(this is clear as it is). 
 The committee elects an executivegroup (this is not always necessary, and when it is necessaryit is not a matter of Rules but of informing the centre of the composition of this group and of the candidate-members to it). 
 The committee distributes the various fields of workamong its members, charging every member to make regularreports to the committee and to keep the C. 
O. 
 and C. 
C. 
informed about the progress of the work (here, too, it ismore important to inform the centre of whatever assignments have been made than to include in the Rules a regulation which more frequently than not will go by the board because of scarcity of our forces). 
 The committee must specify ex-actly who its members are. 
 New members are added to thecommittee by co-optation. 
 The committee appoints the dis-trict groups, factory subcommittees and certain groups (if you wish to enumerate them you will never be done, and there is no point approximately in enumerating them inthe Rules; it is sufficient to inform the centre about theirorganisation). 
 The district groups and subcommitteesorganise the following circles.... 
 It would be all the less use-ful to draw up such Rules at present since we have practical-ly no general Party experience (and in many places none whatever) with regard to the activities of the various groupsand subgroups of this sort, and in order to acquire such ex-perience what is needed is not Rules but the organisationof Party information, if I may put it in this way. 
 Each ofour local organisations now spends at least a few evenings on discussing Rules. 
 If instead, each member would devote this time to making a detailed and well-prepared reportto the entire Party on his particular function, the work would gain a hundredfold. 
 And it is not merely because revolutionary work does not always lend itself to definite organisational form that Rules are useless. 
 No, definite organisational form is neces-sary, and we must endeavour to give such form to all our work as far as possible. 
 That is permissible to a much greater extent than is generally thought, and achievable not through Rules but solely and exclusively (we must keep on reiterating this) through transmitting exact information to the Party centre; it is only then that we shall have real organisationalform connected with real responsibility and (inner-Party)publicity. 
 For who of us does not know that serious conflicts and differences of opinion among us are actually decidednot by vote “in accordance with the Rules”, but by struggle and threats to “resign”? During the last three or four years of Party life the history of most of our committees has been replete with such internal strife. 
 It is a great pity that thisstrife has not assumed definite form: it would then havebeen much more instructive for the Party and would havecontributed much more to the experience of our successors. 
 But no Rules can create such useful and essential defi-niteness of organisational form; this can be done solelythrough inner-Party publicity . 
 Under the autocracy we can have no other means or weapon of inner-Party publicitythan keeping the Party centre regularly informed of Partyevents. 
 And only after we have learned to apply this inner-Party publicity on a wide scale shall we actually be ableto amass experience in the functioning of the various organ-isations; only on the basis of such extensive experienceover a period of many years shall we be able to draw upRules that will not be mere paper Rules . 
 POLITICAL STRUGGLE AND POLITICAL CHICANERY At present it seems that the home policy of the Russian Government can least of all be accused of insufficient reso-luteness and clarity. 
 The fight against the enemy at home is in full swing. 
 Hardly ever has there been a time when fortresses, prisons, police stations, and even private homesand apartments temporarily converted into lock-ups havebeen so crammed with persons under arrest. 
 There is no roomfor all those who have been seized; it is impossible to send allthe exiles to Siberia by the usual “means of transportation”, without equipping extraordinary “expeditions”; there are neither the forces nor the means for instituting a uniformregime for all prisoners, and the wholly arbitrary behaviourof the distraught and tyrannical local authorities especiallyrouses the indignation of the prisoners and drives them toprotest, struggle, and hunger-strikes. 
 The higher authorities, however, while leaving it to the small fry to deal with the internal enemies already in custody, are zealously continu-ing their labours to “improve” and reorganise the policewith a view to striking further against the very roots andbranches. 
 It is war pure and simple, and it is not only be-coming apparent to ever greater masses of the Russian pop-ulation, but is actually being more or less directly felt by them. 
 The vanguard of police and gendarmerieflying squads are slowly but surely followed by the heavyartillery of the law. 
 Take the laws of the preceding month,and the first things to strike you are the new ukases whichdestroy the last vestiges of Finland’s liberties, and in addi-tion, perhaps, the extensive law on mutual aid societies for the nobility. 
 The first of these measures completely under-mines the independence of the Finnish courts and Senate, making it possible for the Governor-General to know every-thing, to control everything, i. 
e. 
, actually converting Finland into one of those numerous Russian provinces which enjoy no rights and are abased. 
 From now on, remarksFinlandskaya Gazeta , the police-controlled government newspaper, there is hope for the “harmonious” activity of alllocal institutions.... 
 I am at a loss to say whether this isa malicious sneer at an unarmed foe who has been dealt a most foul and deliberate blow, or unctuous twaddle in the spirit of “Judas” Golovlyov. 
 90 The second of the laws mentioned above is the latest offspring of the same Select Committee for Affairs of theNobility, which has already blessed the fatherland with thelooting of Siberian lands (“the imposition of landed propri-etorship in Siberia”). 
 91 At a time of severe commercial and industrial crisis and complete impoverishment in the coun-tryside, when millions of workers and peasants are prey tohunger, malnutrition, and distress, it is of course impos-sible even to imagine a better way of using the people’smoney than for hand-outs to the unfortunate landed gentry. 
 First, the government will grant to each mutual aid society for the nobility a certain lump sum (“at the discretion ofHis Majesty the Emperor”!), and, secondly, over a periodof ten years it will grant them as much again as membersof the local nobility will themselves contribute. 
 The socie-ties will assist those who have difficulty in paying interest on loans. 
 The gentlemen of the nobility need have no com-punction about accepting loans when they have been shownsuch an easy way of getting money for payments fromthe pockets of the people. 
 And as if deliberately to sum up this policy of persecu-tion, violence, and plunder, to generalise and consecrate it, there came the tsar’s addresses to the nobility, Zem-stvoists, peasants, and workers (in Kursk and St. 
 Peters-burg). 
 The tsar thanked the nobility for the service it hadrendered him, service “dictated by conscience rather thanby fear”, and promised to display ceaseless concern in thepromotion of landed proprietorship, “which constitutes the age-old pillar of law and order and of the moral strength of Russia”. 
 To the Zemstvoists the tsar said nothing atall either about a pillar, or about the moral strength of Russia, or about service dictated by conscience rather than by fear. 
 He told them briefly and plainly that their “mis-sion is to organise local efforts in the sphere of economic requirements”, and that only if they bore this in mind, onlyif they discharged this mission successfully, could they beassured of his graciousness. 
 This was an absolutely definiteanswer to the constitutional yearnings of the Zemstvoists,a direct warning (or, to be more exact, challenge) to them, a threat to withhold his “graciousness” in the event of the slightest transgression on their part beyond thebounds of “local efforts in the sphere of economic require-ments”. 
 Further, to the peasants the tsar openly expressed cen-sure for the “disturbances” and the “plunder of estates”, describing as “merited punishment” the brutal beating and torture of the muzhiks who had risen in hunger and despera-tion, and recalling the words of Alexander III, who had en-joined them to “obey the Marshals of the Nobility”. 
 Lastly,to the workers the tsar spoke neither more nor less than“about enemies”, his enemies, who should also be the ene-mies of the workers. 
 And so, the noblemen are the faithful servants and the age-old pillar of law and order. 
 The Zemstvoists (or Zemstvo no-blemen?) get a warning. 
 The peasants too are censured andare commanded to obey the noblemen. 
 The workers arefaced squarely with the question of enemies . 
 Instructive speeches. 
 It is instructive to compare them, and it would be most desirable to acquaint as many people as possible bothwith the exact text and the real meaning of these speeches,through the medium of proclamations, leaflets, and talks instudy circles and at meetings. 
 Simple explanatory notesto the text of these speeches would serve as splendid mate-rial for agitation among the most unenlightened part of the most backward sections of the working class, the small trad-ers and manufacturers, and the peasantry. 
 And not only the“ignorant”, but also many an enlightened and educatedRussian citizen would also benefit by careful pondering overthe tsar’s speeches—especially from among the liberals in general and among the Zemstvoists in particular. 
 It is not often that one hears from the lips of royalty such an explicitavowal, confirmation, and declaration of war at home: war of the various classes of the population, war against domestic enemies. 
 And an open avowal of war is an excellent remedy against all and sundry forms of political chicanery, i. 
e. 
, attempts to gloss over, evade and hush up the war, orattempts to constrict and dwarf its nature. 
 The political chicanery to which we refer is exhibited both by the government and the peaceful opposition, andoccasionally even by the revolutionaries (although it is true that in the case of the latter it assumes a special form which does not resemble the former). 
 On the part of thegovernment it is deliberate enticement, bribery, and corrup-tion, in short, a system that has come to be known as “Zu-batovism”. 
 Promises of more or less extensive reforms, actualreadiness to carry out the tiniest fraction of what has been promised, and the demand to refrain from political struggle in return for this—such is the essence of Zubatovism. 
 Noweven some of the Zemstvoists already see that the parleysbetween Mr. 
 Plehve, Minister of the Interior, and Mr. 
 D. 
 N. 
Shipov (Chairman of the Moscow Zemstvo Board) constitutethe beginning of “Zemstvo Zubatovism”. 
 Plehve promises to deal “more favourably” with the Zemstvo (cf. 
 Osvobozh-deniye , No. 
 7), promises to convene a conference of chair-men of Zemstvo Boards early next year for “settling allquestions concerning the functioning of Zemstvo institu-tions”, demanding in return that the Zemstvoists “saynothing about representation in the higher government bodies”. 
 It would appear that the matter is as clear as can be: the promise is most indefinite, while the demandis such that, if it is complied with, the Zemstvoists’yearnings cannot be realised. 
 Against this political deceit,trickery, and corruption there is only one remedy: merci-less exposure of the tricksters, and a resolute political (i. 
e. 
, in Russian conditions, revolutionary ) struggle against the police autocracy. 
 Judging by Osvobozhdeniye , our Zem-stvoists, however, are not yet equal to this task. 
 Theyreply to political chicanery in kind, and their mouth-piece betrays utter instability. 
 In No. 
 7 of Osvobozhdeniye this instability is particularly glaring owing to the fact that opinions on the question at issue are voiced not only by the editors but also by several contributors with whomthe editors more or less disagree. 
 In the editorial, the view that Plehve’s promises are a trap and an expression of Zubatovism is given only as the opinion of a few Zemst-voists, and right next to this we are given the opinion of other Zemstvoists who “are inclined to follow the minister’sinstructions” (!!). 
 The editors are far from the idea of launch-ing a campaign against Zemstvo Zubatovism. 
 Theyhave cautioned the Zemstvoists against “concessions” tothe government (in Nos. 
 5 and 6), but they do not come out with a resolute condemnation of Mr. 
 Shipov and Co. 
, who have heeded the advice of the old police fox and deletedfrom the agenda of the spring congress of the Zemstvo Point4 (which dealt with the necessity of supplementing theSelect Committee on the Needs of the Agricultural Industrywith elected Zemstvo representatives). 
 The conclusion drawn by the editors in their leading article is not that the Zemst-vo is degraded because part of the Zemstvoists have fallenfor the police’s vile bait, but because the very fact of nego-tiations between the government and the Zemstvo “provesthat the Zemstvo is now already a ‘representativebody’” (!!) and that the “congress” promised by Mr. 
 Plehve (it seems to me Mr. 
 Plehve spoke only about a “conference”?) “is desirable in any case”, since it“cannot but clear up the relations between the Zemstvoand the government”. 
 The editors are “firmly convinced thatthe Zemstvoists will behave at the congress as befits them—as representatives of the people, and not as assistants to the ministers in the economic sphere”. 
 If one judges solely by this leading article, one must, on the contrary, be firmlyconvinced that the Zemstvoists will again act as “assis-tants” of the police authorities, as Messrs. 
 Shipov and Co. 
have done (until another Zemstvo trend thrusts them aside,or refashions them). 
 A welcome relief from the political chicanery in this leading article is offered by further articles from contrib-utors: Mr. 
 Anton Staritsky’s and even more so the articleof the Zemstvo Councillor Mr. 
 T. 
 The former calls the ac-tion of Mr. 
 Shipov and Co. 
 a “false step”, advises the Zem-stvoists “not to be hasty in thinking that some sort of con-gress arranged by Mr. 
 Plehve will confirm them in their birthright”, advises them not to fall for the bait, and refrainfrom political chicanery. 
 The editors comment: “On the whole we agree with the author of this article”, evi-dently in the opinion that, in particular, political chicanery should not be condemned so one-sidedly. 
 * The second contributor, however, openly rebels against the entire stand of Osvobozhdeniye , attacking its incomplete-ness and irresolution, condemning such false language as,for instance, references to “the people’s anarchy”, anddeclaring that “it is impossible to rest content with half-measures, that it is necessary to decide to go on to the very end”, that “it is necessary to have done with the servilehalf-measures of the legal opposition...” “stopping at nosacrifice”, that “unless we become revolutionaries, we [Zem-stvoists] will be unable to contribute anything substantialto the cause of the political emancipation of Russia”. 
 From the bottom of our hearts we welcome these honest and firm statements by the Zemstvo councillor and earnestlyadvise everyone who takes an interest in the problem underexamination to make a study of them. 
 He fully confirms the appraisal of the Osvobozhdeniye programme given by us in Iskra . 
 More than that: his article shows not only the correctness of our point of view, but also the expediency of our sharp exposure of the half-heartedness of liberalism. 
It appears that among the Zemstvoists themselves thereare people who are repelled by shilly-shallying of any sortand whom we must make special efforts to support by ruth-lessly criticising such shilly-shallying from our standpoint. 
 The editor of Osvobozhdeniye , of course, does not agree with Zemstvo Councillor T. 
 and—respectfully but firmly—declares: “We see many things in a different light.... 
” Tosay the least! And what then are the objections of theeditors? They boil down to two main points: firstly, Mr. 
Struve prefers peaceful paths “on principle”, in contrast, as he believes, to some revolutionaries; secondly, he ac-cuses the latter of insufficient tolerance. 
 Let us examinethese objections. 
 *In No. 
 8 of Osvobozhdeniye , which we have just received, we already have a more resolute condemnation of political chicanery and Mr. 
 Shipov’s false step. 
 Good! Perhaps the incident with thisrespected personage will induce the editors to look for the roots of“political chicanery” in their fundamental views about the relationsbetween liberalism and the revolutionary trends? In an article headed “Apropos of a Reproach” Mr. 
 Struve (the article is over his signature. 
— Ed. 
) quotes my article in No. 
 2-3 of Zarya (“The Persecutors of the Zemstvo and the Hannibals of Liberalism”). 
 What displeased him par-ticularly, of course, were the words: “if, for once at least,the people taught the government a good lesson” itwould be of “enormous historical significance”. 
 * You see, Mr. 
 Struve decidedly and categorically disagrees that violent revolution is preferable to peaceful reform. 
 The most resolute Russian revolutionaries, he says, preferredthe peaceful path on principle, and no doctrines whatevercan stifle this glorious tradition. 
 It is difficult to conceive of anything more fallacious and laboured than this argument. 
 Does Mr. 
 Struve really fail to understand that a slave who has risen in revolt is morally entitled to speak about the preferability of peacewith the slaveowner, whereas a slave who renouncesrebellion sinks into shameful hypocrisy when he repeats thevery same words? “The elements of revolution in Russiaare, unfortunately or fortunately , not yet ripe”, says Mr. 
 Struve, and this word “fortunately” shows him up com-pletely. 
 As for the glorious traditions of revolutionary thought, Mr. 
 Struve would be well advised to keep silent on thisscore. 
 We need only refer to the famous closing words ofthe Communist Manifesto . 
 92 We need only recollect that thirty years after the publication of the Manifesto , when the German workers were deprived of a portion of therights which the Russian people have never had, Engelsretorted to Dühring in the following words: “To Herr Dühring force is the absolute evil; the first act of force is to him the original sin; his whole exposition is a jeremiad on the contamination of all subsequent his-tory consummated by this original sin; a jeremiad on theshameful perversion of all natural and social laws by thisdiabolical power, force. 
 That force, however, plays alsoanother role in history, a revolutionary role; that, in thewords of Marx, it is the midwife of every old society preg-nant with a new one, that it is the instrument with the aid *See present edition, Vol. 
 5. 
— Ed. 
 of which social movement forces its way through and shat-ters the dead, fossilised political forms—of this there is not a word in Herr Dühring. 
 It is only with sighs and groans that he admits the possibility that force will perhaps benecessary for the overthrow of the economic system of ex-ploitation—unfortunately, because all use of force, for-sooth, demoralises the person who uses it. 
 And this in spiteof the immense moral and spiritual impetus which has been given by every victorious revolution! And this in Germa-ny, where a violent collision—which indeed may be forcedon the people—would at least have the advantage of wipingout the servility which has permeated the national con-sciousness as a result of the humiliation of the ThirtyYears’ War. 
 And this parsons’ mode of thought—lifeless, insipid and impotent—claims the right to impose itself on the most revolutionary party that history has known!” 93 Let us proceed to the second point, dealing with tol-erance. 
 What we need is “mutual understanding”, “completefrankness”, and “great tolerance” in relations between thevarious trends, we are unctuously instructed by Mr. 
 Struve (like many Socialist-Revolutionaries and exponents of public opinion). 
 Well, and what should we do, we ask him, if ourcomplete frankness will seem to you to be lack of toler-ance? If we, for example, find that Osvobozhdeniye has a right hand and a left hand, a pernicious and treacherousleft hand, does not complete frankness make it incumbent upon us to wage ruthless battle against this left hand? Does not such frankness oblige us to fight against the ad-venturism (and political chicanery) of the Socialist-Revo-lutionaries, when they display it both in questions of thetheory of socialism and in the attitude they have towardsthe class struggle in all their tactics? Is there even the slightest trace of political sense in the demand to water down this struggle and to render it innocuous for the sakeof that which the very people this struggle is directedagainst are pleased to term tolerance? It is high time to dispense with your tawdry show of naïveté, gentlemen! High time to understand the simple truth that it is not political chicanery, not what the late Stepnyak 94 once called self-restriction and self-concealment, not the conventional lie of diplomatic mutual recognition /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR that ensure a genuine (and not merely an alleged) joint struggle against the common enemy, but actual participa-tion in the struggle, actual unity in struggle. 
 When the struggle of the German Social-Democrats against the mil-itary-police and feudal-clerical reaction really becameone with the struggle of any genuine party which relied forsupport upon a definite class of the people (for instance,the liberal bourgeoisie), then joint action was instituted without any phrase-mongering about mutual recognition. 
 One does not talk about recognising a fact that is obviousto everyone and felt by everyone (we, for instance, do notask anyone to recognise the working-class movement!). 
Only people who confuse politics with political chicanerycan think that the “tone” of polemics can interfere with a genuine political alliance. 
 But so long as we have evasive talk instead of genuine participation in our struggle, solong as we have only adventurist tactics instead of a genuineadvance towards our struggle on the part of some othersocial stratum or class, no spate of threatening or miserablewords will bring “mutual recognition” one iota nearer. 
 Iskra , No. 
 26, October 15, 1902 Published according to the Iskra text CONCERNING DEMONSTRATIONS95 It seems to us that the writer of the letter raises the question rather too bluntly and underestimates the sig-nificance of organised demonstrations. 
 We have as yet done little in this important matter, and our efforts must be concentrated mainly and primarily on organisation. 
 As longas we lack solidly united revolutionary organisations ca-pable of mustering several detachments of picked people todirect all aspects of a demonstration, so long will failuresbe inevitable. 
 Once an organisation like that takes shape and gains strength in the process of work, through a number of experiences, then it (and it alone) will be able to decidethe question as to when and how it is necessary to arm, andwhen and how arms should be used. 
 This organisation willalso have to give serious attention to the question of raising“the speed of mobilisation” (a very important circumstance quite rightfully emphasised by the writer of the letter), of increasing the number of active demonstrators, trainingmarshals for demonstrations, extending agitation amongthe masses, drawing “the crowd of onlookers” “into thework”, and of “corrupting” the troops. 
 Precisely because astep like the transition to armed street fighting is a “tough” one and because it is “inevitable, sooner or later”, it can and should be taken only by a strong revolutionary organisa-tion which directly leads the movement. 
 Written late in October 1902 Published according Published for the first time to the manuscript VULGAR SOCIALISM AND NARODISM AS RESURRECTED BY THE SOCIALIST-REVOLUTIONARIES Ridicule has its good effects. 
 In the articles entitled “Revolutionary Adventurism”, * we expressed the firm conviction that our Socialist-Revolutionaries would neveragree to state their theoretical position in unambiguousand precise terms. 
 To refute so malignant and unjust a sug-gestion a series of articles has been started in No. 
 11 of Revo-lutsionnaya Rossiya under the title “Questions of Pro-gramme”. 
 Good! Better late than never. 
 We welcome in ad-vance all articles in Revolutsionnaya Rossiya on “questions of programme” and we promise close attention directedtowards ascertaining whether it will actually be possibleto extract any programme from them. 
 With this end in view, let us examine the first article, “The Class Struggle in the Countryside”, but we shall first remark that when our opponents say (No. 
 11, p. 
 6) “ourprogramme has been set out”, they are once more beingunduly ... “carried away”. 
 You must admit, gentlemen,that this is not true! You have not yet set out any pro-gramme, i. 
e. 
, you have not only failed to produce a complete exposition of your views as officially endorsed by the Party (a programme in the narrow sense of the word, or at leasta draft programme), but you have not even defined in theleast your attitude towards such fundamental “questionsof programme” as the question of Marxism and opportunistcriticism of it, or the question of Russian capitalism, and of the position, significance, and tasks of the proletariat which *See pp. 
 184-205 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 that capitalism has called into being, and so on. 
 All we know of “your programme” is that you occupy an altogether indefinite position between revolutionary Social-Democracy and the opportunist trend on the one hand, and between Russian Marxism and Russian liberal Narodism on theother. 
 We shall now show you, using the issue you have taken up, the kind of inextricable contradictions you are entangled in, as a result of this laboured attempt to sit between two stools. 
 “It is not that we fail to understand, but we denythat the present-day peasantry as a whole belongs to thepetty-bourgeois strata,” writes Revolutsionnaya Rossiya (No. 
 11). 
 “We regard the peasantry as being sharply divided intotwo fundamentally different categories: 1) the working peasantry which lives by the exploitation of its own labour-power [!??] and 2) the rural bourgeoisie—middle andpetty—which to a greater or lesser extent lives by theexploitation of the labour-power of others. 
” The Socialist-Revolutionary theoreticians, who consider that the “essen-tial distinguishing feature” of the bourgeois class is its “source of income” (use of the unpaid labour of others), discover “tremendous similarity in principles” betweenthe rural proletariat and the “independent farmers” wholive by applying their own labour to the means of production. 
“Labour, as a definite category of political economy, isthe basis of the existence of both groups. 
 This is one point. 
 Another is that under present conditions both are merci-lessly exploited . 
” Consequently, they must be put into a single category of the working peasantry. 
 We have deliberately presented the arguments of Revo-lutsionnaya Rossiya in such detail in order to enable the reader to ponder over them and to appraise their theoreti-cal premises. 
 That these premises are without foundation is patent. 
 To look for the fundamental distinguishing featureof the various classes of society in their sources of incomeis to give precedence to relations of distribution, whichin reality are only a consequence of relations of production. 
This error was long ago pointed out by Marx, who described as vulgar socialists those who failed to see it. 
 The funda-mental criterion by which classes are distinguished is theplace they occupy in social production, and, consequently, the relation in which they stand to the means of production. 
 Appropriation of one part or another of the social means of production and its application to private enterprise, to undertakings organised for the sale of the product, is thefundamental distinction of one class in present-day society(the bourgeoisie) from the proletariat, which is deprived ofthe means of production and sells its labour-power. 
 To proceed: “ Labour , as a definite category of political economy, is the basis of the existence of both groups. 
” It is not labour that is a definite category of political econ-omy, but only the social form of labour, the social organ-isation of labour, or, in other words, the mutual relationsof people arising out of the part they play in social labour. 
The same mistake in vulgar socialism, which we have ana-lysed above, is repeated here in another form. 
 When the Socialist-Revolutionaries say: “In essence, the relationsbetween farmer and farm-labourer, on the one hand, and be-tween independent peasants and the money-lenders, the ku-laks, on the other, are exactly the same,” they are repro-ducing in its entirety the mistake of, say, German vulgar socialism, which, in the person of Mühlberger, for example, stated that in essence the relations between employer andworker are the same as those between house owner and ten-ant. 
 Our Mühlbergers are equally incapable of distin-guishing between the basic and the derivative forms ofexploitation, and confine themselves to declamations on the subject of “exploitation” in general. 
 Our Mühlbergers are equally incapable of understanding that it is precisely theexploitation of wage-labour that forms the basis of thewhole predatory system of today, that it is the exploitationof wage-labour that leads to the division of society intoirreconcilably opposed classes, and that only from the point of view of this class struggle can all other manifestations of exploitation be consistently gauged, without lapsinginto vagueness and abandoning all principles. 
 Our Mühl-bergers must therefore meet from those Russian socialistswho value the integrity of their movement and the “goodname” of their revolutionary banner a rebuff just as decisive and merciless as that which the German Mühlberger met. 
 To give a clearer idea of how muddled our Socialist-Revolutionaries’ “theory” is, we shall approach the ques-tion under discussion from its practical aspect and try to illustrate it by concrete examples. 
 In the first place, the vast majority of the petty bourgeoisie is everywhere and always working and being exploited. 
 Otherwise, why should it be classed among transitional and intermediate strata?In the second place, small artisans and tradesmen areworking and being exploited in a commodity-producing society in exactly the same way as the peasants are. 
 Per-haps our Socialist-Revolutionaries would like to create also a “category” of “working” trade-and-industrial popu-lation instead of the “narrow” category of the proletariat?Thirdly, in order that the Socialist-Revolutionaries mayappreciate the importance of the “dogma” they so dislike, letthem try to visualise a peasant living near some town, who, without hiring any hands, lives by his own labour and by the sale of all kinds of agricultural produce. 
 We make bold tohope that even the most ardent Narodniks will not venture todeny that this sort of peasant belongs to the petty bour-geoisie and that it is impossible to “unite” him in the sameclass (mark you, we are talking of a class, not of a party) with the wage-workers. 
 But is there any difference in prin-ciple between the position of this kind of commercialfarmer and that of any small farmer in a society of a devel-oping commodity economy? The question now arises how can we account for the fact that Messrs. 
 the Socialist-Revolutionaries are (to put it mildly) drawing closer to vulgar socialism? May it not be a chance peculiarity in this particular writer? Torefute this supposition it will suffice to quote the followingpassage from No. 
 11 of Revolutsionnaya Rossiya , where the writer exclaims: “As if it were all a matter of the sizeof one and the same economic category” (the big and petty bourgeois) “and not of a difference in principle” (just listen to that!) “between two categories, viz. 
, labour economy andbourgeois capitalist economy!” It would be difficult for useven to imagine a more complete and obvious confirmationof what we said in our article, “Revolutionary Adventurism”:scratch a Socialist-Revolutionary and you find Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
 This sentence alone is enough to explain the Socialist-Revolutionaries’ position to anyone at all familiar withthe evolution of Russian social and political thought. 
 It is a known fact that at the bottom of the pale-pink quasi-socialism which used to embellish (and still embellishes) liberal Narodism, the trend prevalent in our educated society, lay the idea that peasant “labour economy” andbourgeois economy are diametrically opposed. 
 This idea,various shades of which have been elaborated in detail byMessrs. 
 Mikhailovsky, V. 
 V. 
, Nik. 
—on, and others, wasone of the strongholds that Russian Marxism directed its criticism against. 
 If, we said, you want to help the peasantry, which is being ruined and oppressed, you must be ableto abandon illusions and squarely face the reality that isdestroying the nebulous dreams about labour economy(or “people’s production”?) and revealing to us the petty-bourgeois character of peasant economy. 
 In Russia, as every-where else, small-scale labour economy can be developed and consolidated only by turning into petty-bourgeoiseconomy. 
 This transformation is actually in progress, andthe working peasant’s true and real tendency towards small enterprise has been irrefutably confirmed by the facts oflife. 
 As commodity economy develops, our peasants, like all small producers and by the very fact that they are such, come under the category of petty bourgeois: they break upinto a minority of entrepreneurs and a mass of proletar-ians; the latter are connected with the “petty proprietors”by a series of transitional stages of being half-workers andhalf-proprietors (such transitional forms exist in all capi-talist countries and in all branches of industry). 
 What then has been the attitude of the Socialist-Revo-lutionaries towards the supplanting of one trend of socialistthought by another, towards the struggle between theold Russian socialism and Marxism? They simply tried toevade making a thorough analysis of the question as long as they could. 
 And when such evasion was no longer possible, when those who wanted to form a separate “party” wereasked to give a clear explanation, when they were forced toreply, forced by derision and by a direct accusation of a lackof principle, only then did these people take to reiteratingthe old Narodnik theory of “labour economy” and the old errors of vulgar socialism. 
 We repeat: we could not have wished for better confirmation of the charge we broughtagainst the Socialist-Revolutionaries, viz. 
, of utterly lacking principle, than this article in No. 
 11, which at-tempts to “unite” the theory of “labour economy” with the theory of the class struggle. 
 * * * As a curiosity, we will add that in No. 
 11 of Revolu-tsionnaya Rossiya attempts are made to give a “plausible” explanation of the decision to avoid all polemics on matters of principle. 
 We are told that Iskra misquotes in its article, “Revolutionary Adventurism”. 
 An example? It omits,for example, the words “in certain places” (in certain placesthe land is passing from capital to labour). 
 How dreadful!An irrelevant phrase has been omitted! Or, perhaps, Rev-olutsionnaya Rossiya will dare assert that the words “in certain places” have a relation, even the slightest , to the question of appraising the process of the passing of land in general (whether or not it is a bourgeois process)? Let it try. 
 Further. 
 Iskra cut the quotation short at the words “by the state”, although this is followed by “of course, not by the present state”. 
 Iskra (we will add) was even more malicious: it had the impudence to term this state a class state. 
 Will our opponents who “have been stung to thequick” assert that the state spoken of in the “minimumprogramme” under examination is not a class state? Lastly, Iskra quoted the leaflet of April 3, in which even Revolutsionnaya Rossiya itself found the appraisal of terrorism exaggerated. 
 Yes, we did quote the reservation made by Revolutsionnaya Rossiya , but we added that we re-garded all this as mere “juggling” and vague hints. 
 Revolu-tsionnaya Rossiya was greatly displeased by this, and has set out to explain and give details (thereby confirming in fact that there was an obscurity which required explan-ations). 
 What are its explanations? At the demand of theParty, you see, amendments were made in the leaflet of April 3. 
 These amendments, however, “were considered in-adequate”, and for that reason the words “in the name of the Party” were deleted from the leaflet. 
 But the words “published by the Party” remained, and the second (the“real”) leaflet, which was brought out on the same date, April 3, did not say a word about differences or exaggera-tions. 
 Having given these explanations and realising that they only confirm the legitimacy of Iskra ’s demand for an explanation (in the words “juggling and hints”), Revolutsi-onnaya Rossiya asks itself the question: how could the Party have issued from its own press a leaflet with whichis was not in agreement? The answer given by Revolutsion-naya Rossiya is as follows: “Why, in exactly the same way as Rabocheye Dyelo , Iskra , Rabochaya Mysl , 96 and Borba97 all appear with the imprint of the Russian Social-DemocraticLabour Party. 
” Very well. 
 But, in the first place, we havepublications of different kinds, and they are printed not atthe “Party” print-shop, but at the print-shops of the variousgroups. 
 In the second place, when Rabochaya Mysl , Ra-bocheye Dyelo , and Iskra all appeared at the same time we ourselves said that this was confusion . 
 What follows from that? It follows that the Social-Democrats themselves laybare and brand confusion in their own ranks and try to get rid of it through serious work on theory, whereas the Socialist-Revolutionaries begin to admit that there is confusion in their ranks only after they have been exposed, and take the opportunity once again to boast of their broad-mindedness,which permits them to issue, on the same day and on theoccasion of the same political event, two leaflets in whichthey give two diametrically opposite interpretations of thepolitical significance of this event (a new terroristic act). 
 Knowing as they do that no good can come of ideological confusion, the Social-Democrats preferred “first to drawa line of demarcation and then to unite”, * thereby ensuring both durability and fruitfulness of the future unity.

 27, November 1, 1902 Published according to the Iskra text ON THE TASKS OF THE SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT98 When hypocritical flirting with both the working class and the “legal” opposition goes hand in hand with action on the part of a horde of infuriated scoundrels of the type of Val or Obolensky,99 it means that the government wants to corrupt and split up those masses and sections of thepeople which it is powerless to break, and in order to facil-itate its task it wants to divert the revolutionary forces,small as their number is, to hunt down each of these scoun-drels. 
 It does not matter whether one representative or another of the government is aware of this in general, orhow well he is aware of it. 
 What matters is that the tacticsto which the government is impelled by all its immensepolitical experience and police instinct, r e a l l y has this significance. 
 When the revolutionary movement per-meates the truly revolutionary classes of the people, more-over, when it grows in depth and extent, holding out thepromise of developing soon into an invincible force, thenthe government finds it advantageous to provoke the bestrevolutionary forces to hunt after mediocre leaders ofmost outrageous violence. 
 But we must not allow our-selves to be provoked. 
 We must not lose our heads at the very first peals of really revolutionary thunder comingfrom the people, cast all caution to the winds, and, to easemind and conscience, eschew all the experience of Europeand the experience of Russia, all more or less definite social-ist convictions, all claims to fundamentally consistent, and not adventurist, tactics. 
 In short, we must not allow realisation of an attempt to restore the Narodnaya Volyamovement and to repeat all its theoretical and practical mistakes that the Socialist-Revolutionaries have under-taken and persist in furthering more and more. 
 Our answer to efforts made to corrupt the masses and provoke the rev-olutionaries must not be given in a “programme” whichwould open the door wide to the most harmful old mistakesand to new ideological waverings, or in tactics that wouldtend to deepen the isolation of the revolutionaries fromthe masses, which is the main source of our weakness and of our incapacity to start a determined struggle at once. 
 We must answer by strengthening the contact betweenthe revolutionaries and the people, and this contact canbe established in our time only by developing and strength-ening the Social-Democratic labour movement. 
 Only theworking-class movement rouses that truly revolutionary and advanced class which has nothing to lose from the collapse of the existing political and social order, the class whichis the final and inevitable product of that order, the classwhich alone is the unquestionable and uncompromisingenemy of that order. 
 Only by relying upon the theory ofrevolutionary Marxism, upon the experience of international Social-Democracy, can we bring about the fusion of our revolutionary movement with the labour movement andcreate an invincible Social-Democratic movement. 
 Onlyin the name of a real workers’ party can we, without losingfaith in our convictions, call on all the progressive elementsin the country to join in revolutionary work, call on all working, all suffering and oppressed people to support socialism.

 3 to the manuscript THE BASIC THESIS AGAINST THE SOCIALIST-REVOLUTIONARIES The basic thesis I am advancing against the Socialist-Revolutionaries, and for an appraisal of all aspects of the activities (and of the whole essence) of this trend is asfollows: the entire trend of the Socialist-Revolutionaries , and their party as a whole , is nothing but an attempt by the petty-bourgeois intelligentsia at escamotage of our working-class movement , and, consequently , the whole of the socialist and the whole of the revolutionary movement in Russia . 
 Let me explain at once why, in this thesis which is so important to me, I could not avoid employing a rare foreignword no doubt incomprehensible to most readers. 
 Escamo-tage means deception, fraudulent appropriation of the results of the labour of others and thus rendering this labour useless, trickery, swindling, etc. 
 It is not difficult to see whyI had to reject these Russian words and choose a foreignword instead. 
 The words “to trick, fool, deceive” are invar-iably associated in our minds with the idea of a delib-erate, conscious lie—that in the first place, and in the second, with the idea of self-seeking, dishonest motives on the part of those who resort to this lie. 
 Yet I am farfrom the idea of accusing the Socialist-Revolutionaries ofanything resembling a conscious lie or dishonest motives. 
Nothing of the kind. 
 I have no doubt that as a trend, asa “party”, the Socialist-Revolutionaries could have originat-ed (or could have survived since the days of the Narodnaya Volya), that they could have grown and gained some strengthof late, thanks entirely to the fact that they attracted people doubtlessly revolutionary-minded and even quite prepared for heroic self-sacrifice, people in all sincerity willing to lay down their lives in the interests of freedom and the interests of the people. 
 But the fact that people adheresincerely and by conviction to a certain social andpolitical stand does not in any way predetermine whetherthis stand is not absolutely false and internally contradic-tory. 
 Would not the results of the best-intended activity based on this stand prove to be (even though unconsci-ously and against the will of those who conduct it) “escamo-tage” of the working-class movement, diverting itfrom the correct course, decoying it into an impasse,etc. 
? I shall try to illustrate my idea by an example. 
 Imag-ine that we are in a huge, dark, humid, and dense semi-virgin forest. 
 Imagine that only by burning down this forestis it possible to prepare the way for the cultivation of theentire area covered by the forest or surrounded by it, andthat it is extremely difficult to procure fire and to sustainit in this forest. 
 It is necessary to dry the timber which is available everywhere in abundance but which catches fire with difficulty, the fire dying easily again and again in theoppressively humid atmosphere. 
 It is necessary to get toget-her the material to be set alight. 
 It is necessary to maintainthe fire (combustion), to protect it, to nurture every flash offire, to let the flame grow, preparing systematically and stubbornly the general conflagration without which the damp and dark forest will not cease to be a forest. 
 Thiswork, however, is very difficult, not only because of theexternal, atmospheric, conditions, but also because of thegreat scarcity of the only suitable material which can burn,which cannot cease burning under any circumstances, which has really caught fire and is burning continuously, with a steady flame unlike the numerous flickering lights whichlack intrinsic power and which in the past so often flashedinto being only to die out after burning for a short time. 
And now, when this basic inflammable material has begunto burn so well as to cause a general rise in the temperature, thereby lending strength and brightness to a mass of other, flickering little flames, people suddenly appear anddeclare with an overweening air: how narrow-minded one must be to believe in the antiquated dogma about the only basic, the only unquestionably reliable inflammable mate-rial! How stereotyped it is to consider all the other little flares merely as by-products, as auxiliary elements, and tothink it absolutely necessary to cling first of all and most ofall to this one material, at any cost! How one-sided it is to keep on endlessly preparing, preparing and preparing thereal general conflagration and to allow those outrageous scoun-drels, the tree-tops, to shelter and maintain the dampness and gloom. 
 What should be done is to fire flares which willknock down the tree-tops, singe them, frighten all the darkforces and produce such a sensation, such a stir, encour-agement and excitation. 
 And these people get to work brisk-ly. 
 With a sigh of relief they heave overboard the antiquated prejudices about some kind of basic inflammable mate-rial. 
 With a calm conscience they accept into their ranksall and sundry, without inquiring into their views andopinions, convictions and aspirations: we are a party ofaction, and it does not matter to us even if some of us haveadopted arguments which tend to extinguish the fire. 
 They call boldly for an undiscriminating attitude towards all kinds of little flames and towards the firing of flares, brush-ing aside with contempt the lessons of the past; now, theysay, there is a great deal more inflammable material, andthere fore sheer light-mindedness is permissible!... And so,despite the harm people of this kind are causing to the movement, can it be thought that they are ordinary deceiv-ers? Nothing of the kind! They are not deceivers at all,but simply pyrotechnists! That, incidentally, is my answer to those Socialist-Revolutionaries who have simply interpreted the term “ad-venturer” as “swindler” (Mr. 
 Rafailov in Geneva) or “rogue” (Mr. 
 Zhitlovsky in Berne). 
 Gentlemen, I told them, you should not necessarily interpret everything in terms of thecriminal code. 
 The adventurism of a revolutionary trend,an internally contradictory, unprincipled, unstable trendwhich conceals emptiness behind high-sounding promisesand is therefore inevitably doomed to bankruptcy, should not be confused with the adventurism of rogues who know very well that they are committing punishable offences andthat they are in danger of being exposed for swindling. 
 We have accused you of adventurism, stating plainly and con-cretely (see Nos. 
 23 and 24 of Iskra *) that it stems from your utter lack of principle in all the basic questions of inter-national socialism, from the incredible muddle of views inyour hastily concocted agrarian programme served out tothe “consumer” under a savoury dressing, from the shakinessand groundlessness of your terrorist tactics. 
 And you reply:look here, we are called adventurers, rogues, swindlers; we are offended, insulted! But these cries, esteemed gen-tlemen, seem very much to imply that in essence you havenothing to object to. 
 It may now be asked: where is the proof of the correct-ness of my thesis? What distinguishing, characteristicfeatures of the entire Socialist-Revolutionary trend should I demonstrate in order to justify the appraisal of the entire trend given in this thesis? If this appraisal is correct, then(it is to be hoped) there is no socialist in the least cons-cientious and serious who would deny the need for a deter-mined and merciless war against this trend, for its harm-fulness to be completely exposed to the widest possible sections of the people. 
 And so, to be able to dig down to the essence of this question and analyse it from everyaspect, I suggest that attention be directed mainly andprimarily to what should constitute the answers to this question. 
 Let those who wish to disprove the correctnessof the appraisal not confine themselves to “complaints” or “amendments”, but answer just as plainly: what are the points which they think require proof in order to corroborate the correctness of the thesis I advanced? The central point of this thesis (escamotage of the work-ing-class movement by the petty-bourgeois intelligentsia)is the fact of escamotage, or, in other words, the fundamen-tal contradiction between the principles, the programme of the “party”, and its actual attitude towards the processof revolutionising present-day society. 
 The contradictionlies in the fact that in reality the party of “Socialist-Revo-lutionaries” does not at all adhere to the standpoint ofscientific revolutionary socialism ( =Marxism) in questions relating to either the international or the Russian work-*See pp. 
 184-205 of this volume.

 ing-class movement. 
 In actual fact, the characteristic feature of this “party” is utter lack of principle in all most important fundamental questions of modern socialism.

 NEW EVENTS AND OLD QUESTIONS To all appearances the brief “lull” which has marked our revolutionary movement for the past six to nine months,as distinguished from its previous rapid and stormy develop-ment, is drawing to a close. 
 However brief this “lull” mayhave been, however obvious it has been to every careful andinformed observer that the absence (for so short a time) of open manifestations of mass indignation among the workers by no means signifies a stop in the growth of this indignationboth in depth and in extent, numerous voices have never-theless been raised among our intelligentsia—who arerevolutionary in spirit but frequently have neither firm tieswith the working class nor a sound foundation of definite socialist convictions—expressing despondency and a lack of faith in the mass working-class movement, on the onehand, and, on the other, calling for a repetition of the oldtactics of individual political assassinations as a neces-sary and obligatory method of political struggle at thepresent time. 
 During the few months that have elapsed since the demonstrations of the previous season, a “party” of “Socialist-Revolutionaries” has had time to arise in ourcountry, and has begun to declaim loudly that demon-strations have a discouraging effect, that “the people,alas, are still a long way off”, and that it is easy, of course , to speak and write of arming the masses, but that now it is necessary to get down to “individual resistance” with-out trying to wriggle out of the urgent necessity ofindividual terror by obsolete references to one and thesame old task (so dull and “uninteresting” to the intellec-tual who is free from “dogmatic” faith in the working-classmovement!) of carrying on agitation among the proletarian masses and organising a mass onslaught. 
 But what at first sight seemed a most ordinary and “com-mon place” strike suddenly broke out in Rostov-on-Don and led to events which manifestly demonstrated the utter stupidity and harmfulness of the Socialist-Revolutionaries’ attempt to restore the Narodnaya Volya movement with all its theoretical and tactical mistakes. 
 The strike, whichinvolved many thousands of workers and began with demandsof a purely economic nature, rapidly developed into a polit-ical event, despite the extreme dearth of organised revolu-tionary forces participating in it. 
 Crowds of people which, according to some participants, numbered between twenty and thirty thousand, held astonishingly serious and well-organised political meetings where Social-Democratic leaf-lets were read and eagerly discussed, political speecheswere delivered, the most casual and untrained representa-tives of the working people were told the elementary truths of socialism and the political struggle, and practical and “object” lessons were given on how to deal with the soldiersand how to appeal to them. 
 The authorities and the policelost their heads (perhaps partly because the soldiers couldnot be relied on?) and for several days proved unable tointerfere with the organising of open-air political mass gatherings, the like of which had never before been seen in Russia. 
 When armed force was finally brought in, the crowdoffered desperate resistance, and the murder of a comradeserved as the occasion for a political demonstration at hisfuneral the following day.... 
 The Socialist-Revolutionaries,however, most likely see the thing in a different light; from their standpoint it would perhaps have been “more expe-dient” if the six comrades murdered in Rostov had giventheir lives in an attempt on the lives of individual policetyrants. 
 We, however, are of the opinion that it is only such mass movements, in which mounting political consciousness and revolutionary activity are openly manifested to all by the working class, that deserve to be called genuinely rev-lutionary acts and are capable of really encouraging everyone who is fighting for the Russian revolution. 
 Whatwe see here is not the much-vaunted “individual resistance”,whose only connection with the masses consists of verbal declarations, publication of sentences passed, etc. 
 What we see is genuine resistance on the part of the crowd; andthe lack of organisation, unpreparedness and spontaneity of this resistance remind us how unwise it is to exaggerate our revolutionary forces and how criminal it is to neglect the task of steadily improving the organisation and pre-paredness of this crowd, which is waging an actual strugglebefore our very eyes. 
 The only task worthy of a revolu-tionary is to learn to elaborate, utilise and make our ownthe material which Russian life furnishes in only too greatsufficiency, rather than fire a few shots in order to create pretexts for stimulating the masses, and material for agitation and for political reflection. 
 The Socialist-Revo-lutionaries cannot find enough praise of the great “agita-tional” effect of political assassinations, about which thereis so much whispering both in the drawing-rooms of theliberals and in the taverns of the common people. 
 It is nothing to them (since they are free of all narrow dogmas on anything even approximating a definite socialist theory!)to stage a political sensation as a substitute (or, at least, as a supplement) for the political education of the proletar-iat. 
 We, however, consider that the only events that can have a real and serious “agitational” (stimulating), and not only stimulating but also (and this is far more important) educational, effect are events in which the masses themselvesare the actors, events which are born of the sentiments ofthe masses and not staged “for a special purpose” by oneorganisation or another. 
 We believe that even a hundred regi-cides can never produce so stimulating and educational an effect as this participation of tens of thousands of working people in meetings where their vital interests and the linksbetween politics and these interests are discussed, and asthis participation in a struggle, which really rouses ever new and “untapped” sections of the proletariat to greaterpolitical consciousness, to a broader revolutionary struggle. 
 We are told of the disorganisation of the government (which has been obliged to replace Messrs. 
 the Sipyagins by Messrs. 
the Plehves and to “select” the vilest scoundrels to serve it),but we are convinced that to sacrifice one revolutionary, even in exchange for ten scoundrels, means only disorga-nising our own ranks, which are thin as it is, so thin that they cannot keep up with all that is “demanded” of them by the workers. 
 We believe that the government is truly dis-organised when, and only when, the broad masses, genuinely organised by the struggle itself, plunge the government into a state of confusion; when the legitimacy of the demands of the progressive elements of the working class becomes appar-ent to the crowd in the street and begins to be clear evento part of the troops called out for the purpose of “paci-fication”; when military action against tens of thousandsof the people is preceded by wavering among the authorities,who have no way of really knowing what this military ac-tion will lead to; when the crowd see and feel that those who have fallen on the field of civil war are their comrades,a part of themselves, and are filled with new wrath and adesire to grapple more decisively with the enemy. 
 Here it isno longer some scoundrel, but the existing system as awhole that comes out as the enemy of the people, against whom are arrayed the local and the St. 
 Petersburg authori-ties, the police, the Cossacks, and the troops, to say nothingof the gendarmes and the courts which, as ever, supplementand complete the picture in every popular uprising. 
 Yes, uprising. 
 However far the beginning of what seemed to be a strike movement in a remote provincial town was from a “genuine” uprising, its continuation and its finale nevertheless evoke involuntary thoughts of an uprising. 
The prosaic motive for the strike and the minor natureof the demands presented by the workers throw into particu-larly bold relief, not only the mighty power of the solidarityof the proletariat, which at once saw that the railway work-ers’ struggle was the common cause of the proletarians, but also its receptiveness of political ideas and political pro-paganda, and its readiness to defend with might and main,in open battle with the troops, those rights to a free life andfree development which all thinking workers have alreadycome to consider common and elementary. 
 And the Don Committee was a thousand times right when it declared in its proclamation, “To All Citizens”, which we print in fullelsewhere in this issue, that the Rostov strike was one ofthe steps towards a general upsurge among the Russianworkers with the demand for political liberty. 
 100 In events of this sort we really see with our own eyes how an armed upris-ing of the whole people against the autocratic government is maturing, not only as an idea in the minds and programmesof the revolutionaries, but also as the inevitable, natural and practical next step of the movement itself, as the result of the growing indignation, growing experience, and growing boldness of the masses, who are being given such valuable lessons, such a splendid education by the realities of Rus-sian life. 
 An inevitable and natural step, I have said—and I hasten to make the reservation: if only we do not permit ourselves to depart by a single step from the impending and pressing task of assisting these masses, who have already begun to rise, to act more boldly and concertedly; of giving them not acouple but dozens of open-air speakers and leaders; of creat-ing a real, militant organisation capable of guiding themasses, and not a so-called “combat organisation” that guideselusive individuals (if it does guide them at all). 
 That this is a difficult task goes without saying, but we can quite justifiably adapt Marx’s words which have so frequentlyand so ineptly been quoted of late, and say: “Every stepof real movement is more important than a dozen” individ-ual attempts and cases of resistance, more importantthan a hundred organisations and “parties” belonging only to the intelligentsia. 
 101 Besides the Rostov fighting, the penal sentences passed on demonstrators are outstanding among recent politicalevents. 
 The government has decided to use every possiblemethod of intimidation, from floggings to penal servitude. 
And what a splendid reply it received from the workers, whose speeches in court we give below 102; how instructive this reply is to all those who were especially loud in theiroutcries about the discouraging effect of demonstrations,not because they wanted to encourage further work in thisdirection, but because they wanted to preach much-vauntedindividual resistance! These speeches, coming as they do from the very thick of the proletariat, are excellent com-mentaries on events like those in Rostov, and, at the sametime, they are remarkable statements (“public manifesta-tions”, I would say if this were not so specifically policeterminology), imbuing with boundless vigour the long anddifficult work for the “real” steps of the movement. 
 What is remarkable in these speeches is the simple, authentically precise description of how the most everyday facts,occurring in scores and hundreds of millions , of the “misery, oppression, slavery, degradation, exploitation” of the workers in present-day society lead to the awakening of their consciousness, to their growing “revolt”, to a revolutionary expression of this revolt (I have put inquotation marks the words I had to use in describing the speeches of the Nizhni-Novgorod workers, for they arethe famous words which Marx uses in the last pages of thefirst volume of Capital , and which evoked such clamorous and unsuccessful attempts on the part of the “critics”, opportunists, revisionists, etc. 
, to refute the Social-Demo-crats and accuse them of not telling the truth). 
 For the very reason that these speeches came from ordinary workers by no means advanced in their develop-ment, workers who did not even speak as members of any particular organisation, but simply as men in the crowd, for the very reason that they stressed not their personalconvictions but facts from the life of every proletarian orsemi-proletarian in Russia, for that very reason their con-clusions are so inspiring: “that is why we consciously wentto the demonstration against the autocratic government. 
” The ordinariness and “mass character” of the facts from which they drew their conclusions are a guarantee that thousands,tens and hundreds of thousands, can and inevitably willcome to the same conclusion, provided we prove capable ofcontinuing, extending, and strengthening systematic, theo-retically consistent, and all-round revolutionary (Social-Democratic) influence over them. 
 We are ready to be con-demned to penal servitude for fighting against political andeconomic slavery now that we have felt the breath of liberty,said four workers from Nizhni-Novgorod. 
 And thousands ofworkers in Rostov, who for several days won for themselvesthe right to hold political gatherings, fighting off a series of attacks on the part of the soldiers against the unarmed crowd, repeated after them as it were: we are ready to face death. 
 By this sign shall ye conquer, is all that remains for us to say to those who have eyes to see and ears to hear.

 Try to concentrate your efforts on self-education as the main purpose of your organisation, in order to develop into convinced, steadfast, and consistent Social-Democrats. 
Draw the strictest possible line of demarcation betweenthis extremely important and essential preparatory workand direct practical activity. 
 On joining (and before joining) the ranks of the army in the field try to establish closest (and most secret) contacts with the local or all-Russian Social-Democratic organisations, so as not to be alonewhen you begin your work, so as to be able to continue whathas already been done before, rather than begin all overagain, to take your place at once in the ranks, to advancethe movement and raise it to a higher stage.

 29, December 1, 1902 Published according to the Iskra text ON THE SVOBODA GROUP The attitude of Messrs. 
 the “Revolutionary-Socialists” towards any analysis of differences in principle is evidentfrom the following. 
 In the pamphlet, What Is to Be Done? , Lenin directly challenged Svoboda to refute the proposition that an “organisation of revolutionaries” is necessary forextending and intensifying work among the masses. 
 In thesame pamphlet Mr. 
 Nadezhdin was given a detailed expla-nation of all the harm and unseemliness of a light-mindedattitude towards theory, of inconsistency in matters of programme (a “revolutionary-socialist” and at the same time practically a Social-Democrat!), of vacillation betweenrevolutionary tactics and the tactics of “economism”, andbetween terrorism and the class struggle of the proletariat. 
In this pamphlet it was plainly pointed out and proved thatSvoboda is sinking to the level of demagogy. 
 * Mr. 
 Nadezhdin preferred to decline the direct challenge. 
 Instead of open battle with visor raised, this noble swashbuckler chose toact on the sly under a cover of a dispute on matters of organ-isation. 
 In their “magazine for workers” (??) the Svoboda group merely hisses and snarls, without explaining itsviews, inciting the “masses” against an “organisation of revolutionaries” and assuring them that Iskra is chopping down the “sound trunk” of “economism”. 
 Disputes overprinciple, it assures us, are nothing but a pastime for intel-lectuals. 
 For the “masses” it is sufficient to raise a howlagainst “domineering” and to indulge in quips about “anempty stomach and the Holy Ghost”, about the “danger of hobnailed jackboots”, about “swine and blockheads”, *See present edition, Vol. 
 5. 
— Ed. 
 about “weakened grey matter” and “pig snouts”, about the “collaring and jaw-breaking department”, etc. 
 (see Otkliki , pp. 
 30-55). 
 Our revolutionary-socialists and Socialist-Revolutionaries persist in debasing “mass” literature tothe level of cheap broadsheets, and for this service of theirsthey claim the right to introduce confusion and corruptioninto all serious Party questions. 
 A programme con-sisting of double book-keeping, tactics consisting of double book-keeping, practical activities consisting of demagogy— there you have a portrait of the “revolutionary-socialist”Svoboda group.

 30, December 15, 1902 Published according to the Iskra text EXTRACT AN ARTICLE AGAINST THE SOCIALIST-REVOLUTIONARIES The fusion of socialism with the working-class movement (this sole guarantee of a strong and truly revolutionary movement) is no easy matter, and it is not surprising that it is attended by vacillation of every kind. 
 That is whatwe wrote exactly two years ago in the first article publishedin the first issue of Iskra . 
 * And if a struggle was necessary against a tendency (trend) that had chosen the correct pathbut had wrongly defined its tasks along that path, it is far more necessary to struggle against a trend that does not even think of any fusion of any more or less integral andwell-substantiated socialism with the working-class move-ment. 
 Lacking a social basis and any links with a definitesocial class, it is endeavouring to cover up its inner impo-tence by the sweep of its emotion, the “breadth” of its pro-gramme, i. 
e. 
 (read), by an unprincipled combination of the most diverse and opposing programmes which are equallyapplicable, precisely because of this quality of theirs, to theintelligentsia, to the proletariat, and to the peasantry. 
Behind the intelligentsia en masse , just as behind the liber-al opposition, it may not be possible to discern any social class (since the liberal-Narodist trend, towards which the old Russian socialism was incapable of adopting a criticalattitude, as are the Socialist-Revolutionaries today, declaresthat it is above classes). 
 The peasantry may be approachedwithout any solution of “accursed” problems relating tothe foundations of its life, or its place in the social and economic evolution of Russia and of the whole world; it *See present edition, Vol. 
 4, p.

— Ed. 
 may be approached with such general revolutionary and socialist phrases (socialist, at first glance) which as far as possible would not be contradictory to any of the accepted and declared solutions of the peasant question. 
 The stormyperiod we are experiencing, with the struggle flaring upnow here, now there, makes it possible, under cover of thisstruggle, to evade all and sundry questions of principle,limiting oneself to sympathetic support of all its manifes-tations and to the invention of “individual resistance” during a comparative lull. 
 And the result is a trend whichis very revolutionary in words, but not in the least revo-lutionary as far as its real views and contacts with therevolutionary class are concerned, revolutionary in itssharp attacks on the government and at the same time entirely incapable of correctly appraising the general tactics of this government and of giving a correct answerto such tactics. 
 And truly, it is not difficult to see thatnotwithstanding all the jumps and waverings, notwith-standing all the confusion of the government in particularinstances, its tactics as a whole betray clearly its two prin-cipal lines of self-defence.

 1 to the manuscript DRAFT APPEAL OF THE RUSSIAN ORGANISING COMMITTEE TO THE LEAGUE OF RUSSIAN REVOLUTIONARY SOCIAL-DEMOCRACY, THE UNION OF RUSSIAN SOCIAL-DEMOCRATS ABROAD, AND THE FOREIGN COMMITTEE OF THE BUND In fulfilment of the decision passed by a conference of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party in the spring of1902, the Organising Committee proposes to the League of Russian Revolutionary Social-Democracy, the Union of Rus-sian Social-Democrats Abroad, 104 and the Foreign Commit-tee of the Bund the formation of a foreign division of the Organising Committee of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party. 
 The functions of this foreign division of the Russian Organising Committee should be as follows: 1) elaboration of the question as to how Social-Demo-cratic organisations abroad should be represented at the congress. 
 The final decision of this question depends upon the Russian Organising Committee and then upon the con-gress itself; 2) assistance from abroad in the arrangement ofthe congress (for example, finances, passports, etc. 
), and3) preparation for the unification of the Social-Democraticorganisations abroad, which is so vitally necessary in the interests of the Party and of the Social-Democratic la-bour movement in Russia in general.

 TO THE GENERAL PARTY CONGRESS105 One of the members of the Organising Committee has asked me to send a list of questions to which it would be desirable to have replies given in the reports of the com-mittees and groups of our Party at its Second Congress. 
I enclose herewith an approximate list of such questions,but first I should like to say a few words about the lengthof this list. 
 Naturally, it would be desirable to have reports on all branches of Social-Democratic work, and the ideal report would therefore embrace an all but endless numberof questions. 
 Of course, we cannot even dream of it beingpossible to present such full reports. 
 Nevertheless, I consid-er it very important and essential for the Organising Com-mittee to endeavour to acquaint each committee or group with the complete range of questions of interest to (and needed by) the congress. 
 Our Second Congress will havean even more constituent character than the First, and we must therefore bend every effort towards making the re-ports as complete and substantial as possible. 
 The closer each group’s report approximates to the ideal, the more com-pletely and exactly will the movement as a whole be repre-sented at our congress, and the more enduring the results ofthe congress. 
 The preparation of the reports, their discussions both in the committees and groups, etc. 
, should begin as muchas possible prior to the congress. 
 In this connection it would be extremely important for the committees and groups, first, to divide among many of their members the workof drawing up the report; secondly, as soon as each section First page of Lenin’s manuscript, “On the subject of Reports by Committees and Groups of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 to the General Party Congress. 
” December 1902-January 1903 Reduced of the report is ready the committees and groups should im-mediately forward a copy of it abroad, i. 
e. 
, to a safe place (without waiting for the complete report); thirdly, they should make a point of drawing into this work not only actual butalso former members, and not only the active but also absentmembers, in other words, those in exile or abroad. 
 Thesepersons could be instructed to prepare reports covering eithera definite group of questions or a definite period when they worked in the committee or group. 
 Such reports, or sections of reports, could greatly facilitate the task of the delegates atthe congress. 
 It stands to reason, furthermore, that the del-egates should also make use of Party literature which con-tains numerous answers to questions in any report, i. 
e. 
,they should try to gather all this literature, make a digest of all that is essential in it, correct any mistakes occurring in it, supplement it, adding whatever could not be printedfor reasons of secrecy, etc. 
 (it is also of the utmost importanceto enlist for this work the co-operation of former membersof committees and groups who are temporarily abroad). 
Incidentally, with regard to secrecy it should be added that there are certain questions to which written answers cannot and should not be given, for that would be disclosing secrets;nevertheless, the answers to these questions must positivelybe considered, prepared, and discussed by the committeesand groups, for at the Party congress it will be obligatory to report on these questions (if not in pleno , then to a spe-cial commission, to the C. 
C. 
, etc. 
). 
 With a view to drawing as many people as possible into the work of drafting the reports, it would be desirable tocirculate the list of questions itself (together with the amend-ments recommended by specific committees, groups orindividual comrades) as widely as possible ; moreover, only the fact that these questions and reports are intended for the Second Party Congress should be kept secret from thebroad circles of Social-Democrats. 
 Finally, there arises the question of the period to be cov-ered by the reports. 
 Formally speaking, it should be the periodbetween the First and Second Congresses, i. 
e. 
, from 1898 to 1903. 
 However, since the First Congress was not fully rep-resentative, lasted too short a time, and was held under ex-tremely unfavourable circumstances, it would be desirable that the reports should also cover the period preceding 1898. 
 It would perhaps not be superfluous to make the reserva-tion that this extremely detailed list of questions for thereport should by no means be interpreted to imply that theperson who is best acquainted with the history of the move-ment, or, in general, who is best able to answer all thesequestions, will make the best delegate to the congress, The congress should be of practical value in uniting the move-ment and giving it a powerful impulse, and those comradeswho, even if they are new, are the most energetic, influen-tial, and devoted to revolutionary work will make the bestdelegates. 
 The reports, however, can be compiled from thecontributions of many people and, in addition, in some cases it will perhaps be possible to delegate more than one person; it would be particularly desirable to give a large number of worker delegates the opportunity of attending the congress. 
 I shall now proceed to give the list of questions, which are divided up into eight sections or groups (the divisionof specific questions and even of groups of questions is oftenartificial and has been made only for convenience in review-ing them, as all questions are most closely intercon-nected). 
 I. 
 THE WORKING-CLASS MOVEMENT, ITS HISTORY AND PRESENT STATE 1) A brief description of the conditions and state of in-dustry. 
 Number, composition, distribution, and other specific features of the local proletariat (industrial, com-mercial, handicraft, etc. 
, possibly agricultural also).

 Describe in as great detail as possible the growth ofthis group of workers from the very outset of the movement. 
 3) As complete a list as possible of strikes and a detailed account of each more or less big strike. 
 Aggregate figuresare desirable.

Whatprotests or dissatisfaction did it arouse and from whom?How did the so-called “economist” views arise? How did they develop and spread? It is very important to describe this most accurately, using all available documentarymaterial, with regard to every “economist” “phase” in thelocal movement. 
 How did differences in the appraisal ofthe various Party papers and in the struggle among theiradherents express themselves? Of Rabochaya Gazeta 106 (1897), Rabotnik ,107 published abroad, and its Listok, of Rabochaya Mysl , Rabocheye Dyelo , Iskra , Zarya , Borba , Zhizn ,108 etc.

? 11 b i s) Have there been any splits and conflicts be-tween workers and the “intelligentsia” among Social-Democrats? It is very important to ascertain the causes and influence of such. 
 12) How has the struggle of trends been waged in the local circles? Only among the Social-Democratic intellec-tuals? Or among the workers too? Among the adherent stu-dent groups? Has it found expression in splits? In the organ-isation of separate groups? Has it flared up over general questions of principle? Over the contents of the leaflets?

 1 MOSCOW ZUBATOVISTS IN ST. 
 PETERSBURG Moskovskiye Vedomosti (No. 
 345, Dec. 
 15, 1902) carries a “Letter to the Publisher”, written by a worker namedF. 
 A. 
 Slepov, which we reproduce in full below. 
 First of all, we would like to lend encouragement to our esteemed “fellow-journalist”, Mr. 
 Gringmut, editor of Moskovskiye Vedomosti , for publishing a document of such great interest. 
 And Mr. 
 Gringmut undoubtedly stands in need of encour-agement, for of late his extremely useful activity in obtaining(and featuring) material for revolutionary agitation has somehow fallen off, faded ... lost some of its fervour. 
 You must try harder, colleague! Secondly, it is of the utmostimportance at the present time that the St. 
 Petersburg work-ers should watch every step of Zubatovism, should collectinformation more regularly about workers who have linkedup with spies and are conferring with former, present and future generals, society ladies, and “true Russian” intellec-tuals, and should spread this information as widely aspossible, explaining it in detail to one and all. 
 Here is the letter, which we have supplemented with a few comments of our own in brackets: “Dear Sir, “Could you find it possible to publish the following in Moskovskiye Vedomosti , which is held in such esteem by all true Russian people: “On the 10th of this month, a meeting of the Board of the Russkoye Sobraniye 110 was held in the premises of the Sobraniye in St. 
 Petersburg and was devoted exclusively to questions concerning the life of Russian factory workers. 
 “Among the most prominent members of St. 
 Petersburg society present at the meeting were: General K. 
 V. 
 Komarov, /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR former Assistant Governor General of Warsaw; Auditor Gener-al A. 
 V. 
 Vasilyev; Colonel A. 
 P. 
 Veretennikov; Count Apra-xin; Count A.

 A. 
 Golenishchev-Kutuzov; General Zabudsky;Admiral Nazimov; Nikolai Vyacheslavovich von Plehve;I. 
 P. 
 Khrushchov, member of the Board of the Ministry ofPublic Education; Professor Zolotaryov of the GeneralStaff; V. 
 S. 
 Krivenko; Count N. 
 F. 
 Heyden; General Demya-nenkov; Archpriest Ornatsky and other church dignitaries. 
 Also present were ladies from the upper circles of St. 
 Peters-burg society, as well as Mayor Lelyanov and CouncillorDekhterev of the City Council. 
 The press was representedby V. 
 V. 
 Komarov, editor of Svyet ; V. 
 L. 
 Velichko, editor of Russky Vestnik ; Syromyatnikov, of the staff of Novoye Vremya ; K. 
 K. 
 Sluchevsky, former editor of Pravitelst-venny Vestnik ; Leikin, editor and publisher of the Oskolki magazine; the painter Karazin, and others. 
 “The meeting opened with a report on the condition of work-ers in the manufacturing industries delivered by I. 
 S. 
 Soko-lov, a worker” (concerning Sokolov see No. 
 30 of Iskra , which gives a fuller list, based on information taken from Svyet , of St. 
 Petersburg worker-Zubatovists. 
— Ed. 
). 
 “In the main, the speaker explained the present condition of the workingclass in the industrial cities, their material and spiritualneeds, their efforts to acquire knowledge, etc. 
” (It is a pitythat Mr. 
 Sokolov’s report has not been published! It would be interesting to see how he managed to “explain” the workers’ efforts to acquire knowledge but made no mention of policepersecution of such efforts. 
— Ed. 
) “Then representatives of the Moscow workers” (would it not be more correct to say:representatives of the Moscow secret police? Was it not onmoney supplied by the police that you and your friends trav-elled to St. 
 Petersburg, Mr. 
 Slepov?— Ed. 
), “among whom I was, also had the honour of attending the meeting of theRusskoye Sobraniye and reporting to that illustrious gather-ing on the state of affairs in the working-class world of Mos-cow. 
 In our report we first of all expressed, on behalf of Rus-sian workers, our profound gratitude to the members of the Russkoye Sobraniye for giving their representatives the opportunity to explain the present condition of the Russianworking class. 
 Further we requested the representatives of Russian higher society to devote serious attention to the edu-cation of the Russian workers” (quite naturally! It is pre-cisely from the upper classes that the worker should expect an education—by means of the whip probably!— Ed. 
), “which is in a far from satisfactory state, a fact that is beingsuccessfully used for socialist propaganda by persons withmalicious intent” (if the lack of education is advantageousto the socialists , why, then, is the government closing schools for workers and reading-rooms? It doesn’t make sense, Mr. 
 Slepov!— Ed. 
), “thereby causing harm not only to the workers, but to the entire Russian state. 
 Then we endeav-oured to call the attention of the illustrious assem-bly to the lack of sympathy among Moscow factory-own-ers for the Moscow workers’ idea of uniting in a close family for the purpose of founding their own mutual aid societies, which are so important for de-livering the workers from crushing want. 
 In this connec-tion we asked members of the illustrious assembly to raisein government circles the question of loans to the workers’mutual aid societies” (see the speech of the Nizhni-Nov-gorod worker, Samylin, before the court, in No. 
 29 of Iskra , in which he tells how he was arrested for taking part in aworkers’ circle studying economics. 
 There is education foryou; there you have mutual aid societies!— Ed. 
). 
 “Undoubt-edly, support of the workers in their material needswould constitute the best refutation of malicious propaganda among them” (can it really be that Mr. 
 Slepov—and what an appropriate name he has! *—seriously believes that for the sake of some miserable hand-out a class-conscious workerwould cease striving for liberty? As to “supporting the non-class-conscious, ignorant mass “in their material needs, this is beyond the power of even the most highly placed patrons of the Zubatovists, since in order to provide such support it is first necessary to change the whole social sys-tem, which rests on destitution of the masses. 
— Ed. 
). 
 “These false ‘ well-wishers ’ of the workers usually say that the workers can improve their life only by means of riots,disturbances, resistance to the authorities, etc. 
 Unfortunate-ly such incitement sometimes meets with success, as every-*Slepov, from slepoi —the Russian for “blind”. 
— Ed. 
 one knows. 
 Peaceful improvement of the workers’ living conditions is the best way to refute these agitators. 
 Then we had the honour to report to the illustrious assembly that in Moscow, despite most widespread unemployment, social-ist propaganda had lost all its appeal of late” (but onlyquite recently we heard of an enormous number of arrests. 
in Moscow! What would be the point of the arrests and whowould there have been to arrest if this propaganda had lost its appeal??— Ed. 
), “precisely because the workers are already beginning to organise and have a Mutual Aid So-ciety and a Consumers’ Society, and because the sympa-thetic attention of the authorities has already been givento the needs of the workers, making it possible to arrangefor them lectures on general education, etc. 
 Besides what has been said above, we also reported to the Sobraniye about cases in Moscow in which we had figured in the capacity ofmediators and conciliators between workers and manufac-turers, not only putting an end to disorders but even avert-ing them, as, for instance, at the Hakental factory, theBromley Bros. 
 factory and the Dobrov-Nabholtz factory. 
 We also mentioned the strike of workers of the Goujon metal-lurgical plant, where the workers of the rolling and nailshops did stop work, but thanks to our intervention did notgo so far as to cause disturbances, and returned to work asa result of our comradely advice” (the workers get plentyof such “comradely” advice during each strike both from the police and from the factory inspectors, who are always asking them to “return to work. 
” This is not comradely, but policeadvice. 
— Ed. 
). 
 “The members of the Russkoye Sobraniye listened to our reports sympathetically” (how else but sympatheticallywould they listen to workers who are helping the police in its business!— Ed. 
) “and many voiced the opinion that serious thought should be given to the question of theworkers and that they should be afforded the opportunityand the means of ridding themselves of the influence of thesocialist doctrine” (an interesting scene: generals andpriests, Zubatov spies and writers loyal to the police spirit intend to “help” the workers rid themselves of the influence of the socialist doctrine!—and incidentally, at the same timeto help hook unwary workers who will swallow the bait. 
— Ed. 
), “allowing them independent activity, under con-trol of government statutes and under the guidance of that section of the intelligentsia which truly loves its native land and is striving for its welfare and prosperity” (fineindependent activity indeed under police control! No, theworkers are already demanding independent activity untram-melled by the police, with the right to choose as leaders thoseof the intellectuals whom they, the workers, trust. 
— Ed. 
). 
 “V. 
 V. 
 Komarov, A. 
 V. 
 Vasilyev, Colonel Vere-tennikov, Mr. 
 Dekhterev, the painter Karazin, PrinceD. 
 P. 
 Golitsyn, and many others reacted most warmlyto the question of the workers. 
 The idea was expressedthat it was necessary to set up special workers’ councils,headed by a central council, which would be a beneficial factor in averting misunderstandings between workers and manufacturers. 
 As Mr. 
 Dekhterev put it, this should beallowed because a crowd can never act intelligently and thatinfluence over a crowd of workers could be exerted best ofall by the workers themselves; as an example, he cited a sim-ilar type of institution in France which was coping with the above-mentioned task successfully. 
” (Yes, Workers’ Coun-cils are meeting with success in France and throughout Eu-rope. 
 That is true. 
 But they are meeting with success becausethere the workers enjoy political liberty, have their ownunions, their own newspapers, their elected representativesin parliament. 
 Does Mr. 
 Dekhterev really think that the St. 
 Petersburg workers are all so naïve as not to know this?— Ed. 
). 
 “The question of government loans to the work-ers’ mutual aid societies also met with sympathy by mem-bers of the Russkoye Sobraniye. 
 The meeting closed with adecision to elect a special commission to consider the stepsto be taken in the matter. 
 We trust that you, Mr. 
 Editor, as a true Russian, will accord us, workers, the same sympathy, and that you will find it possible to publish the above inyour paper, so that our best people may all unite for a jointstruggle against the enemies of our native land, who arestirring up sedition among the mass of the people, sowingthe seeds of internecine strife and undermining loyalty to the time-honoured traditions, and respect and reverence for the supreme authority. 
 We are firmly convinced that there arealso people in Russia who are ready to give their all to the service of their fatherland, to offer up their forces and abilities on its altar and, in close communion, to erect an insurmountable barrier to falsehood and malice in Russia. 
 “F. 
 A. 
 Slepov, worker. 
” And at the close Mr. 
 Slepov could not but let his tongue run away with him! All support for the workers’ needs, all sympathy on the part of the government boiled down to one thing: to form groups from among the workers themselvesto combat socialism. 
 This is the truth of it. 
 And it will bemost interesting for the workers to learn that in addition tothe knout and imprisonment, exile and prisons, the Zubatovworkers will also try to inculcate in them “respect and rever-ence for the supreme authority”. 
 No sensible worker will say at a public meeting what he really thinks—that wouldbe delivering himself directly into the hands of the police. 
But through our own papers, our own leaflets and our own meetings we can and must see to it that the new Zubatovcampaign is turned entirely to the good of socialism. 
 Iskra , No. 
 31, January 1, 1903 Published according to the Iskra text ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE FORMATION OF AN ORGANISING COMMITTEE111 Four years ago several Russian Social-Democratic organisations united in the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party and workedout a certain plan of organisation and general principles of activity, which were set forth in the “Manifesto” published by the Party. 
 112 Unfortunately, this first attempt was not crowned with success: the elements necessary for building up a united and strong Social-Demo-cratic Party, which would wage an unremitting struggle for the eman-cipation of the proletariat from all forms of oppression and exploita-tion, did not as yet exist. 
 On the one hand, the very forms of the practical activity of the Russian Social-Democrats were only just beginning to take shape. 
 The Social-Democrats, who had but recentlyentered on the path of struggle, were still seeking the best ways ofputting their theoretical views into practice and were still advancingwith timid and uncertain steps. 
 The working-class movement, onwhich they based their activities and which was finding expression in tremendous strikes, had only just burst forth in a brilliant flash that dazzled the eyes of many, obscuring from their vision the tasksand aims, so clear and definite, of revolutionary Social-Democracy,and inducing an enthusiasm for a narrow trade-union struggle. 
 On theother hand, the constant repressions practised by the governmentagainst the Social-Democratic organisations, which had not yet become strong or firmly rooted, destroyed all continuity and cut short any tradition in their activities. 
 However, this unsuccessful attempt did not pass without a trace. 
 From that time on, the very idea of an organised political party of theproletariat, which guided our forerunners, became the lodestar andgoal of all class-conscious Social-Democrats. 
 In the course of these four years, repeated attempts have been made to give effect to this idea, which has been handed down to us by the first Social-Democraticleaders. 
 But to this day we are faced with the very same disorganisationthat existed four years ago. 
 At the same time, life makes greater and greater demands on us. 
 Whereas the first leaders of the Party made it their task to rouse the dormant revolutionary forces of the mass of the workers, we are faced with the much more complex task of guiding the awakening forcesin the right direction, of taking our place at the head of these forces and of leading them. 
 We must be prepared at any moment to hear the call: “Lead us whither you have called us!” It will be a fearful thing if that moment takes us unawares, just as divided and unprepared as we are at present. 
 Let it not be said to us that we are exaggeratingthe gravity of the moment. 
 Anyone capable of seeing beyond ripples on the surface, anyone capable of discerning a process that is going on in the depths, will never suspect us of exaggeration. 
 But the gravity of the situation is enhanced by still other cir-cumstances. 
 We are passing through a momentous period in history. 
 The awakening of the working class in connection with the generalcourse of Russian life has roused various sections of society to activity. 
 More or less consciously they are striving to organise for the purpose of joining, in one way or another, the struggle against an obsoleteregime. 
 We wish them every success! Social-Democrats can only welcome all who join such a struggle. 
 But they must vigilantly watch lest such allies make Social-Democracy a tool in their hands, lestthey divert it from the main field of activity, lest they deprive it of the leading role in the struggle against the autocracy and, what is most important, lest they hinder the progress of the revolutionarystruggle by diverting it from the correct path. 
 That this danger is no figment of the imagination is clear to everyone who has carefully followed the development of the revolutionary struggle in recentyears. 
 Thus, Russian Social-Democracy is now faced with a gigantic task, one that is beyond the power of any local committee or evendistrict organisation. 
 No matter how perfect the local organisations may be, they will not be able to cope with this task, for it has already grown beyond local bounds. 
 It can be accomplished only by the col-lective forces of all Social-Democrats in Russia, welded into a single, centralised, disciplined army. 
 But, then, who is to assume the initia-tive for this unification? This question was discussed last year at a conference of representa-tives of the St. 
 Petersburg League of Struggle, the Central Committee of the United Committees and Organisations of the South, the Iskra organisation, the Central Committees of the Bund (in Russia and abroad), the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad, and some other organisations. 
 The conference instructed representatives ofcertain organisations to form an Organising Committee, which would assume the task of actually re-establishing the Russian Social-Demo-cratic Labour Party. 
 In fulfilment of this decision, representatives of the St. 
 Petersburg League of Struggle, the Iskra organisation, and Yuzhny Rabochy group * have formed an Organising Committee, which sets itself the first and foremost task of preparing the conditions for the convocation of a Party congress . 
 *The Bund was also invited to send its representative to the Organising Committee, but for reasons unknown to us, the Bund didnot respond to this invitation. 
 We hope that these reasons were purely accidental, and that the Bund will not delay in sending its repre-sentative. 
 However, since the convocation of a congress is a highly complex matter and requires considerable time, the Organising Committee assumes, until the re-establishment of the central Party body, certain general functions (the issuing of leaflets intended for the whole of Rus-sia, general transport arrangements and methods of underground work, the establishment of contacts between the committees, etc. 
). 
 It is self-evident that the Organising Committee, which has arisen on the initiative of several organisations, will be bound by obligatory relations only with those organisations that have already authorised it or that will authorise it to act for them. 
 Its relation to all othercommittees and groups is that of a separate organisation, which offers its services to them. 
 The task which the Organising Committee has decided to under-take is a great and responsible one, and, if it has nevertheless made so bold as to do so, that is only because the need for unity is so pres-sing, because disunity is making itself felt all too keenly, and becausecontinued disorganisation constitutes so great a threat to the common cause. 
 In setting to work, the Organising Committee believes that the success of its activity will depend to a considerable extent on theattitude adopted towards it by the Social-Democratic committees and organisations, and this attitude itself will be regarded by the committee as a criterion of the correctness with which it has gaugedthe present situation. 
 The Organising Committee December 1902 * * * This statement by the newly-formed Organising Committee of our Party speaks eloquently enough for itself, and thereis no need for us to devote many words to explaining thegreat significance of the step that has been taken. 
 Unifica-tion, the re-establishment of a united Party, is the most pressing task of the Russian Social-Democrats, a task thaturgently requires immediate accomplishment. 
 This task isa very difficult one, for it is not unity of a few handfulsof revolutionarily minded intellectuals that we need, butunity of all leaders of the working-class movement, which has roused the whole of a large class of the population to independent life and struggle. 
 We need unification basedon a strict singleness of principle which must be consciouslyand firmly arrived at by all or by the vast majority of commit-tees, organisations, and groups, of intellectuals and workers,who act in varying circumstances and under varying condi-tions and have sometimes achieved their Social-Democratic convictions along the most diverse paths. 
 Such unification cannot be decreed; neither can it be established immediately, by mere resolutions adopted by assembled delegates. 
 It must be prepared and developed systematically and gradu-ally, so that the general Party congress can consolidate andimprove what has already been accomplished, continue whathas been started, and complete and formally endorse thefirm foundation for further, more widespread and intensework. 
 And that is why we particularly welcome the wisely cautious and modest way in which the Organising Committee has entered upon its duties. 
 Without insisting on any kindof obligatory relations with the mass of Russian Social-Democrats, the Organising Committee confines itself tooffering its services to all of them. 
 And so let all Russian Social-Democrats without exception—committees and circles, organisations and groups, those on active service and those temporarily on the retired list (exiles, etc. 
)—make haste torespond to this call; let them strive to establish direct andactive contacts with the O. 
C. 
; let them give their mostactive support to the great work of unification. 
 We must seeto it that not a single group of Russian Social-Democrats fails to establish contacts with the O. 
C. 
, or work in comrade-ly harmony with it. 
 Further, while regarding the preparationand convocation of a general Party congress as its primarytask, the O. 
C. 
 also assumes certain general functions in the service of the movement . 
 We are confident, that no Social-Democrat will fail to recognise the pressing need for this extension of functions on the part of the O. 
C. 
, for this is merely an extended offer of its services —an offer that goes to meet demands expressed thousands and thousands of times—an offer that does not entail the forfeiture of any “rights”,but rather the practical abandonment of isolation asspeedily as possible, and the tackling in common of a num-ber of joint undertakings. 
 Finally, we also consider abso-lutely correct and in place the resolute statement ofthe O. 
C. 
 that the convocation of a congress is a highlycomplex matter and requires considerable time. 
 This, ofcourse, does not at all mean that the convocation of the con-gress should be put off. 
 Nothing of the sort. 
 If we take into account the urgency of the congress, then we would have to admit that even one month is too “considerable” a period forits convocation. 
 But if we bear in mind our conditions of work and the necessity for adequate representation of the entire movement at the congress, then five or even ten times as long a period will not cause a single Party worker who is at all experienced to lose heart. 
 Let us then wish every success to the work for the speed-iest possible unification and re-establishment of the Partyand let us show our sympathy with this work not only inwords but in immediate action on the part of every one of us. 
 Long live Russian and international revolutionary Social-Democracy! Iskra, No. 
 32, January 15, 1903 Published according to the Iskra text SOME REFLECTIONS ON THE LETTER “7 Ts. 
 6 F. 
”113 I am writing under the fresh impression of your letter, which I have just read. 
 Its senseless twaddle is so exasperat-ing that I am unable to suppress the desire to state myopinion frankly. 
 Please send my letter on to the author and tell him that he need not take offence at the severe tone. 
 After all, it is not meant for publication. 
 The letter deserves a reply, in my opinion, because it shows up in particularly bold relief a characteristic traitin the mood of many present-day revolutionaries: waitingfor instructions; demanding everything from above, from others, from outside; looking lost when faced by failures caused by local inactivity; piling up complaint after com-plaint, and inventing recipes for a cheap and simple cure ofthe evil. 
 You will not invent anything, gentlemen! If you your-selves are inactive, if you permit splits to take place under your very noses and then heave sighs and make complaint— no recipes will help you . 
 And it is utterly absurd to shower us with complaints on this score. 
 Don’t imagine that youoffend us by your accusations and attacks: you see, we havebecome inured, so devilishly inured to them that they do not provoke us! “Mass” literature “by the hundredweight”—this battle-cry of yours is nothing but an imaginary recipe for someone else to cure you of your own inactivity. 
 Believe me, no such recipes will ever work! If you yourselves are not energetic and alert, no one will help you in any way. 
 It is highlyunreasonable to wail, “ g i v e us this or that, d e l i v e r something or other”, when you yourselves should do the getting and delivering . 
 It is useless to write about it to us, for we cannot do it from here, whereas you can and should do it by yourselves: I am referring to the delivery of literature we are publishing and have on hand. 
 Some local “activists” (so called because they are inactive), who have seen no more than a few issues of Iskra and who do not work actively to get and distribute it in mass quan-tities, invent the flimsy excuse: “That is not what we want. 
Give us mass literature, for the masses! Masticate it for us, put it into our mouths, and perhaps we’ll manage to do the swallowing ourselves. 
 How phenomenally absurd these plaints appear to those who know and see that they, these local “activists”, are unable to organise the distribution of even what is avail-able. 
 Is it not ridiculous to read: give us hundredweights,when you are unable to take and transport even a f e w p o u n d s ? Do that first, worthy “dreamers for an hour” (for the first mishap makes you abandon everything, evenall your convictions!). 
 Do that, and then, when you havedone it not once, but dozens of times, the publication, too,will grow with the demand. 
 I say it will grow, for your plaints about mass literature (which you have uncritically and senselessly copied from theSocialist-Revolutionaries, Svoboda people, and all sorts of confused “inactivists”) are caused by forgetfulness of asmall ... a very small trifle, namely, forgetfulness of the factthat you are unable to take and distribute even a hundredth part of the mass literature we are publishing now. 
 I shall take one of the recent lists of one of our few (miserably,pitifully, shamefully few) consignments. 
 The Nizhni-Nov-gorod speeches , the Rostov struggle , the pamphlet on strikes , the Dikstein pamphlet *—I shall limit myself to these. 
 Four, only four small items! So little!! *“This is old stuff!” you wail. 
 Yes. 
 All parties that have good popular literature have been distributing o l d s t u f f : Guesde and Lafargue, Bebel, Bracke, Liebknecht, etc. 
, f o r d e c a d e s . 
 Do you hear: for decades! And the o n l y popular literature that is good , the only popular literature that is suitable is that which can serve for decades . 
 For popular literature is a series of textbooks for the people and textbooks teach the ABC, which remains unchanged for f i f t y y e a r s at a time. 
 The “popular” literature which “captivates” you and which the Svoboda group and Socialist-Revolutionaries publish by the hundredweight every month is waste paper and charlatanism . 
 Charlatans always bustle and make the greatest noise, and some naïve people mistake that for energy. 
114 Yes, it is very little! Yes, we need four hundred, not four. 
 But, permit me to ask you, have you been able to distrib-ute at least these four things by the ten thousand ? No, you have not been able to do this. 
 You have not been ableto distribute them by the hundred even. 
 That is why you shout: give us hundredweights! (No one will ever give you anything if you are unable to take it: bear that in mind). 
 Have you been able to make use of the hundreds of copies which have been delivered to you, brought to you, and placed into your mouths ?? No, you have not been able to do that. 
 Even in this trifle you have not been able to link up themasses with Social-Democracy. 
 Every month we get tensand hundreds of leaflets, reports, news items, and lettersfrom all parts of Russia, but we have had not a single (give good thought to the exact meaning of the words, “not a single”!) report about the distribution of these hundredsof copies among the masses , about the impression they made on the masses , about the reaction of the masses , about dis-cussions among the masses on t h e s e things! You are plac-ing us in a position wherein the writer does the writing and the reader (the intellectual) does the reading—after which this same slothful reader fulminates against the writer be-cause he (the writer!!!) does not furnish literature “by the hun-dredweight” everywhere. 
 The person whose sole business itis to l i n k u p the writer with the masses sits like a ruffled turkey and gobbles away: give us mass literature, while at the same time he is unable to make use of even a h u n-d r e d t h p a r t of what is available. 
 You will of course say that it is impossible , impossible in general, to get, for instance, Iskra , our main product, linked up with the masses. 
 I know you will say that. 
 I have heard it hundreds of times and have always replied that this is untrue, that it is a subterfuge, shirking, inability, and indolence, the desire to have roast duck fly straightinto your mouths. 
 I know from the facts that enterprising people have been able to “link up” Iskra (this super-intellectual Iskra , as the sorry little intellectuals consider it) with the masses of even such backward and uneducated workers as those in the indus-trial gubernias around Moscow. 
 I have known workers who have themselves distributed Iskra among the masses (there) and who merely remarked that there were too few copies. 
 Quite recently I heard a “soldier from the field of battle” tell of how in one such out-of-the-way factory area in central Russia Iskra is read at one and the same time in numerous circles, at gatherings numbering from ten to fifteen people,the committee and subcommittees themselves reading over every issue in advance, planning jointly just how to use each article in agitation talks. 
 And they were able to make use of even those paltry five to eight (maximum: eight !!) copies which were all that they got owing to the helpless inactivityof the activists stationed near the border (who are nevereven able to make arrangements for reception of literatureconsignments and hope that the writer will give birth notonly to articles but to people to do the work for them!). 
 Come now, tell us with your hand over your heart: have many of you made such use of e v e r y copy of Iskra you received (delivered to you, brought to you)? You are silent! Well then, let me tell you: one out of a hundred copies that get to Russia (by the will of the fates and due to the inactivityof the “readers”) is being used in this way , with discussions on the agitation value of every item, with readings of every item in workers’ study circles, in all circles of all workers who are accustomed to foregather in a particular town. 
And yet people who are unable to assimilate even a hundredth part of the material that gets to them wail: give us hundred-weights!! Shchedrin’s formula (the writer does the writing) still regards the “reader” far, far too optimistically!! The present-day reader (from among the Social-Demo-cratic intellectuals) has gone so far as to complain about thewriters because the local intellectuals are lazy and “order” the workers about, without doing anything for them. 
 Thecomplaint is justified, a thousand times justified, only ... is it directed to the proper quarter? Won’t you permit us to return this complaint to the sender , with a double charge as punishment?? What about yourselves, my worthy complain-ants? If your friends are unable to make use of Iskra for readings in workers’ study circles, if they are unable t o assign people for the delivery and distribution of literature, if they are unable to assist the workers to set up circles for this purpose, why d o n’t y o u t h r o w such helpless friends o v e r b o a r d ?? Just think, in what sort of pretty situation do you find yourselves when you complain to us about y o u r o w n helplessness? It is a f a c t that the “practicians” do not make use of even a hundredth part of all they could take . 
 And it is a no less indubitable fact that the special varieties of “mass” literature which these people have thought up are only pre-texts and dodges. 
 In the letter of “7 Ts. 
 6 F. 
”, for instance,three varieties are recommended to “us” (it would be to us, of course): 1) A popular newspaper. 
 Chew over every fact so as to make its assimilation possible without digestion, so that w e, “activists”, should need no stomachs at all. 
 It does not matter that the world has never yet seen such a “popular” “newspaper”, since a newspaper gives answers to everything , while popular literature gives in-struction on a few things . 
 It does not matter that all our examples of such literature, beginning with Rabochaya Mysl , on through Vperyods , Rabocheye Dyelos , Krasnoye Znamya s, and the like, have unavoidably and necessarily proved mongrels, being neither popular nor newspapers. 
 It does not matter that all efforts of the “workers’” news-papers have merely nurtured, and always will nurture, the absurd division into an intellectual movement and a work-ing-class movement (a division caused by the dull-witted-ness and bungling of the intellectuals, who go so far as tosend complaints about their own bungling from the seat of the trouble to the ends of the earth!). 
 It does not matter that all the efforts of the “workers’” newspapers so far have been breeding, and will always breed among us, amateur-ishness and special, profound, Kazan and Kharkov theories. 
All this does not matter. 
 Look at the captivating Svoboda group and the captivating (“breath-taking”) Socialist-Rev-olutionaries; what a mass (ugh, what a mass!) of popularnewspapers and periodicals they are publishing!! Narod-noye Dyelo , Krasnoye Znamya , Svoboda —a magazine for workers, Otkliki —a newspaper and magazine for workers, Luchina —for peasants, Rabochaya Mysl —the Geneva news-paper of the St. 
 Petersburg workers!! It does not matter that all this is trash, but it is m a s s trash for all that. 
 And all you have is just one Iskra ; after all, it gets mo-notonous! Thirty-one issues and all Iskra , while with the116115 captivating people every two issues of one title (of trash) are immediately followed by three issues of another title (of trash). 
 Now, this is energy, this is jolly, this is new! But our Social-Democrats.... 
 2) And “they” are always having new pamphlets. 
 Each reprint is considered a pamphlet and all this is meretriciouslytrumpeted forth, and the printed sheets are added up (amillion printed sheets: see No. 
 16 of Revolutsionnaya Ros-siya. 
 They have broken all records! Champions!). 
 But in our case! Reprints are not counted as pamphlets— that is highbrowism, bookishness!! The ancient Diksteinpamphlets are being republished, when every girl in Parisand in Chernigov knows that ten new pamphlets (trash) are worth a hundred times more than one old pamphlet, even a good one. 
 It is only the Germans who do things in such a way that, for example, in 1903 Bebel’s Our Aims , written thirty-four years ago, is being republished for the eleventh time!! That is so boring. 
 Our “captivating” Socialist-Revolutionariesare pouring out stuff. 
 But our local “activists” are able to use neither the o l d Plekhanov pamphlets (twenty years old: ancient stuff! To the archives with them!), nor “some”one (one!) pamphlet on strikes 117 and on the Witte memo-randum! This quite apart from the fact that the local “activist” does not lift a finger to squeeze g o o d pamphlets out of authors now in exile—and to get local writers to contribute to “Iskra ”. 
 Why do that? It is much easier to complain than to undertake such a troublesome business! And the present-day reader unblushingly calls himself an Iskra -ist on the grounds that he writes complaints to Iskra . 
 Nor does it trouble his conscience in the slightest that 99 per cent of the articles are written by the one and the same three and a half writers. 
 Nor does he find it necessary even to think about thefact that Iskra must not be allowed to stop publication and that the fortnightly issue of one and a half to two signaturescalls for a lot of work. 
 Still, he continues to shout with sim-ply unparalleled fatuity: thirty-one issues, and there are still many fools in the localities and much helpless wailing!! A truly crushing argument.... 
 Only whom and what does itcrush? 3) Leaflets. 
 G i v e us leaflets! The committees cannot do it!! Write, deliver, bring (and distribute?) leaflets! Well, now, this is indeed consistent. 
 I open my mouth and you shovel it in: here we have the new formula for therelations between the “writer” and the Iskra practician! To go so far as to state that the local organisations (con-sisting of slothful “activists”?) cannot manage to issue local leaflets, that these leaflets should be delivered from abroad, that is the limit . 
 This is such a splendid (in my opinion) crowning touch to the whole letter of “7 Ts. 
 6 F. 
” thatit only remains for me to conclude with this “crown”. 
 Anyfurther remarks or comments will only dim its shininglustre.

 CONCERNING THE STATEMENT OF THE BUND We have just received No. 
 106 of the Bund’s Posledniye Izvestia (dated February 3 (January 21 *)), which reports an exceptionally important, drastic and highly lamentablestep taken by the Bund. 
 It appears that in Russia there has come out a statement of the Central Committee of the Bund on the announcement of the Organising Committee. 
 As a mat-ter of fact, it would be more correct to say: a statement onthe footnote in the announcement of the Organising Com-mittee, for it is mainly this single footnote that the Bund deals with in its statement. 
 This is what it is all about. 
 As our readers know, the Or-ganising Committee stated in this terrible “footnote”, which(ostensibly!) was the spark that set the forest on fire, lit-erally the following: “The Bund was also invited to send its representative to the Organising Committee, but for reasons unknown to us, the Bund did not respond to this invitation. 
 We hope that these reasons were purely accidental, and that the Bund willnot delay in sending its representative. 
” ** What, we ask, could be more natural and innocent than this footnote? How else could the O. 
C. 
 have acted? Toavoid mentioning the Bund would have been wrong, since the O. 
C. 
 did not and could not ignore it so long as the Bund, on the basis of the decision of the Party Congress in 1898,was affiliated to the Russian Social-Democratic LabourParty. 
 And once we did mention it, we had to state that wehad invited it. 
 Clear enough, one would think? And it iseven clearer that if the O. 
C. 
 did not know the reasons for *Second date Old Style. 
— Ed. 
 **See p. 
 306 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 the Bund’s silence, this is exactly what should have been stated: “for reasons unknown to us. 
” By adding the words: we hope that these reasons were purely accidental and that the Bund will not delay in sending its representative—theO. 
C. 
 openly and straightforwardly expressed its desire towork together with the Bund for the organisation of the congress and the re-establishment of the Party. 
 Obviously, if the Bund also shared this desire, it would only have to send its representative, who was invited both through secret channels and in the press announcement. 
Instead, the Bund enters into polemics with a footnote (!!), and in a printed statement gives a separate and particular exposition of its opinions and views on the tasks of theO. 
C. 
 and the conditions for convoking a congress. 
 Prior to examining the Bund’s “polemic” and analysing its views, we must protest most emphatically against the Bund coming out with a separate statement in the press, since such actionis an infringement of the most elementary rules governingthe joint conduct of revolutionary activities and especially organisational activities. 
 One of two things, gentlemen. 
 Either you do not want to work in one common O. 
C. 
, in which case no one, of course, will complain of your actingseparately, or you want to work jointly, in which case you arein duty bound to state your views, not in separate statements to the public, but to the comrades on the O. 
C. 
, which comesout publicly only as an integral body. 
 The Bund itself is, of course, fully aware that its action flies in the face of all rules of comradely conduct of common affairs, and it attempts to take refuge in the following feeblejustification: “Since we have had no possibility to expressour views on the tasks of the forthcoming congress eitherthrough personal attendance at the conference or through participation in drawing up the ‘Announcement’, we are obliged to make up for this omission, at least to some extent,by the present statement. 
” The question arises: does theBund really intend in all seriousness to assure us that ithad “no possibility” to send a letter to the O. 
C. 
? Or to senda letter to the St. 
 Petersburg Committee? Or to the Iskra organisation, or Yuzhny Rabochy ? And besides was there no possibility for the Bund to send its delegate to oneof these organisations? Did the Bund try to take at least one of these “impossibly” difficult steps, which very likely were especially difficult for an organisation so weak, inex-perienced and lacking in all links as the Bund? Stop this game of hide-and-seek, gentlemen! It is both stupid and unbefitting. 
 You acted separately because youwanted to act separately. 
 And you wanted to act separately in order to indicate and immediately carry out your decision to place your relations with the Russian comrades on a new footing: not to affiliate to the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party on the basis of the Rules of 1898, but to enterinto a federative alliance with it. 
 Instead of discussing this question in detail and comprehensively before the entirecongress, as we wanted to do, when for a very long time we refrained from continuing the polemic we started on the ques-tion of federation and nationality 118—instead of doing this, as all or the vast majority of the Russian comrades undoubtedlywanted to do, you wrecked joint discussion. 
 You did not act as a fellow comrade of St. 
 Petersburg, the South, and Iskra , one who desired to discuss together with them the best formof relations (both prior to the congress a nd at the congress ); you acted as a contracting party , apart from all the members of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 presenting your own terms to the whole of this Party. 
 Love cannot be forced, says the Russian proverb. 
 If the Bund does not want to remain in the closest alliance withthe Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, which was properly recommended by the Congress of 1898, then of course it will cease to maintain the old relations. 
 We donot deny the “right” of the Bund to express its opinion andits desire (in general, we do not indulge in talk about “rights”in the cause of revolution except in cases of dire necessity). 
But we do very much regret the fact that the Bund has shown so little tact as to give expression to its opinion in a separate public statement when it was invited to enter a commonorganisation (the O. 
C. 
) which had not expressed in advance any hard and fast opinion on the given question and was calling a congress for the express purpose of discussingeach and every opinion. 
 The Bund wanted to provoke an immediate declaration of opinions on the part of all those who entertain differentviews on this question. 
 Very well! We, of course, shall not refuse to do so. 
 We shall tell the Russian proletariat, and shall specially repeat to the Jewish proletariat, that the present Bund leaders are committing a grave political error, which will undoubtedly be corrected by time, experience,and the growth of the movement. 
 At one time the Bund sup-ported “economism”, helped to bring about the split abroad,and adopted resolutions stating that the economic struggleis the best means of political agitation. 
 We rose up against this and fought it. 
 And the fight helped to rectify the old mistakes, of which very likely not even a trace has remained. 
We fought against the urge towards terrorism, which to allappearances vanished even more rapidly. 
 We are convincedthat nationalist passion too will vanish. 
 In the end theJewish proletariat will understand that its most vital in-terests demand the closest unity with the Russian proletariat in one party, that it is the height of folly to decide in advancewhether the evolution of the Jewish people in free Russiawill differ from its evolution in free Europe, that the Bundought not to go beyond the demand (in the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party) for the complete autonomy in matters concerning the Jewish proletariat, which was fully recognised by the 1898 Congress and which has never beendenied by anyone. 
 But let us return to the Bund’s statement. 
 It terms the footnote to the “Announcement” of the O. 
C. 
 “ambiguous”. 
This is an untruth that borders on malicious slander. 
 A few lines later, the Bund’s Central Committee itself admits that the “reasons for our representative’s absence from theconference were purely accidental. 
” And what did the O. 
C. 
say? It expressed the hope that it was only for accidentalreasons that the representative of the Bund did not attend. 
You yourselves confirm this assumption and then grow angry over it. 
 Why is that? Further. 
 No one can know of accidental occurrences in advance. 
 Hence, the assertion of the Bund’sForeign Committee that the O. 
C. 
 knew the reasons that prevented the representative from appearing is absolutelyunfounded. 
 The Bund’s Foreign Committee is in generalplaying a very unseemly part in this affair: the Bund’s Foreign Committee supplements the statement of the Bund’s Central Committee with its own inventions, which flatlycontradict the words of even the C. 
C. 
 itself! How could the Bund’s Foreign Committee ascertain that the O. 
C. 
 knew the reasons for the Bund’s absence, when it was the C. 
C. 
 (and not the Foreign Committee) of the Bund that was invited, and when the C. 
C. 
 itself says that the reasons forthis absence were purely accidental?? “We are convinced,” says the Bund’s C. 
C. 
, “that had the initiators of the conference taken a little more trouble, theseaccidental reasons could not have kept us from responding.... 
” We would ask any impartial person: if two comrades who are preparing to get together in the O. 
C. 
 admit in a singlevoice that the reasons which prevented the meeting were“purely accidental”, is it not out of place and unseemly tostart a public polemic on who is more to blame for the non-appearance? On our part, let us remark that we long ago expressed our regret (of course, not in the press, but in a let-ter) over the absence of the Bund, and we were informed thatthe Bund had been invited twice : first, by letter, and then by word of mouth through the X. 
 Committee of the Bund. 
 The delegate arrived almost a month after the conference, the Bund complains. 
 Yes, this is a terrible crime, and, of course, it deserves public exposure, since it lends particular conspicuousness to the punctuality of the Bund, which hasnot got round to sending a delegate even after two monthshave passed! The delegate “did not keep his promise” to send the “An-nouncement” of the O. 
C. 
 either in manuscript or in printed form, but without fail prior to its distribution.... 
 We advise our Russian comrades not to talk to certain people withoutmaking a record of the conversation. 
 We too were promisedby the Iskra organisation that we would be sent both the manuscript and a printed copy of the “Announcement”,but nevertheless we did not receive the manuscript at all, and saw the printed copy much later than members of organ-isations which have no contacts with the Iskra organisation. 
 Let the Bundists decide the question of whether it would beseemly on our part if we began to publish accusations againstthe Iskra organisation of having broken its promise. 
 The delegate of the O. 
C. 
 promised the Bund’s C. 
C. 
 to write at once to the comrade charged with the printing of the “Announce-ment” about holding up the printing: this was actually prom-ised (so far as we can judge from information at our disposal). 
 This promise was kept, but it was too late to stop the print-ing, since there was no time to get in touch with the print-shop. 
 To sum up: the O. 
C. 
 initiators wrote letters, made a per-sonal announcement through the X. 
 Committee, and senta delegate to the Bund’s Central Committee, while for monthsthe Bund did not send a single letter , let alone a delegate! And yet the Bund comes out in the press with accusations! And strangely enough the Bund’s Foreign Committee af-firms that the initiators of the conference behaved “strange-ly”, that their activities are decidedly at variance with theiraim, that they displayed “haste” (the Bund’s C. 
C. 
, on thecontrary, accuses them of slowness!), that they merely wantto “create the impression” that the Bund “was indifferent”!! We have still to say a few words about the charge against the O. 
C. 
 that it has not drawn “the only correct conclusion”,namely: “Since actually there is no party, the forthcomingcongress should be in the nature of a constituent congress,and, therefore, the right to participate in it should be accord-ed to all Social-Democratic organisations in Russia, both Russian and those of all other nationalities. 
” The Bund is trying to get round the unpleasant fact that, since it doesnot have a single centre, the Russian Social-DemocraticLabour Party consists of a number of committees and organs,and possesses a “Manifesto” and resolutions of the First Con-gress, at which, incidentally, the Jewish proletariat was also represented by people who had not yet made their mark in “economist,” terrorist, and nationalist waverings. 
 By formal-ly advancing the “right” of “all” nationalities to found thelong-ago-founded Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party,the Bund manifestly confirms that it is precisely over thequestion of the notorious “federation” that it has raised the whole issue. 
 But the Bund should be the last to raise this question, and it is not about “rights” that the issueshould be raised among serious revolutionaries. 
 Everyoneknows that the question of cementing and uniting a basicnucleus of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Partyis on the order of the day. 
 We cannot but favour representa-tion of “all” nationalities at the congress, but at the same time we must remember that we can think of expanding the nucleus or allying it with other organisations only after the formation of this nucleus has been completed (or, at the very least, after there is no doubt about its stability) Until we have ourselves become united organisationally and have firmly set out along the correct path, amalga-mation with us will not give anything to “all other” nation-alities! And the answer to the question of the possibility (and not of the “right”, gentlemen!) of “all other” nation-alities being represented at our congress depends on a number of tactical and organisational steps by the O. 
C. 
 and the Russian committees, depends, in short, on how successfulthe activity of the O. 
C. 
 will be. 
 It is a historical fact thatfrom the very outset the Bund has tried to put a spoke inthe wheel of the O. 
C.

 33, February 1, 1903 Published according to the Iskra text ON THE MANIFESTO OF THE LEAGUE OF THE ARMENIAN SOCIAL-DEMOCRATS A new Social-Democratic organisation has made its ap-pearance in the Caucasus: The League of Armenian Social-Democrats . 
 This League, as we know, began its practical activities over half a year ago and already has its own paper,published in Armenian. 
 We have received the first issue of thispaper, which is called Proletariat and next to its title car-ries the inscription “Russian Social-Democratic Labour Par-ty”. 
 It contains a number of articles, commentaries, and re-ports dealing with the social and political conditions which have called into existence the League of Armenian Social-Dem-ocrats, and giving a general outline of the programme ofits activities. 
 The leading article, “Manifesto of the Armenian Social-Democrats”, states: “In its activities, the League of Arme-nian Social-Democrats, as one of the branches of the Rus-sian Social-Democratic Labour Party which extends the net-work of its organisations far and wide over the entire expanseof Russia, is in complete accord with the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
, andwill fight together with it for the interests of the Russianproletariat in general, and of the Armenian proletariat in particular. 
” Further, after referring to the rapid development of capitalism in the Caucasus and the monstrously powerfuland manifold results of this process, the authors go on tospeak of the present state of the working-class movement inthe Caucasus. 
 In the industrial centres of the Caucasus, suchas Baku, Tiflis, and Batum, with their big capitalist estab-lishments and numerous industrial proletariat, this move-ment has already struck deep roots. 
 However, because ofthe extremely low cultural level of the Caucasian workers, their struggle against the employers has naturally been of a more or less instinctive, spontaneous nature till now. 
 A force was necessary which could unite the workers’ scat-tered forces, give their demands articulate form and devel-op class-consciousness among them. 
 That force is socialism. 
 Then, after briefly setting forth the main theses of scientific socialism, the League explains its stand in rela-tion to the present-day trends in international, and, in par-ticular, Russian, Social-Democracy. 
 “The attainment of the socialist ideal,” says the Manifesto, “is, in our opinion,conceivable neither through the working class’ efforts in theeconomic sphere nor through partial political and socialreforms; it is possible only by completely smashing theentire existing system, by means of a social revolution, to which the political dictatorship of the proletariat must be the necessary prologue. 
” Then, pointing out that the existingpolitical system in Russia is hostile to every social move-ment, especially to that of the working class, the Leaguedeclares that it sets itself the immediate task of politicallyeducating the Armenian proletariat and drawing it into the struggle of the entire Russian proletariat for the overthrow of the tsarist autocracy. 
 Without at all denying the needfor the partial economic struggle of the workers against theemployers, the League, however, does not consider it ofimportance in itself. 
 The League recognises this struggle inso-far as it improves the material condition of the workers and helps develop political consciousness and class solidarity among them. 
 Of particular interest to us is the League’s attitude towards the national question. 
 “Taking into consideration,”says the Manifesto, “that the Russian state is made up ofmany different nationalities at varying levels of cultural development, and believing that only the extensive develop-ment of local self-government can safeguard the interestsof these heterogeneous elements, we deem essential theestablishment of a federative [italics ours] republic in the future free Russia. 
 As to the Caucasus, in view of the ex-tremely diverse national composition of its population, we shall strive to unite all the local socialist elements and all the workers of the various nationalities; we shall strive tocreate a united and strong Social-Democratic organisation, for a more successful struggle against the autocracy. 
 In the future Russia we shall recognise the right of all nations to free self-determination, since we regard national freedom as being only one of the aspects of civil liberties in general. 
Proceeding from this proposition, and taking into accountthe above-mentioned diverse national composition of theCaucasus and the absence of geographical boundaries betweenthe various nationalities, we do not find it possible to in-clude in our programme the demand for political autonomy for the Caucasian peoples; we demand only autonomy inmatters pertaining to cultural life, i. 
e. 
, freedom of language,schools, education, etc. 
” We whole-heartedly welcome the Manifesto of the League of Armenian Social-Democrats and especially its splendid attempt to give a correct presentation of the national ques-tion. 
 It is highly desirable that this attempt be carriedthrough to the end. 
 Two fundamental principles by which allSocial-Democrats in Russia should be guided in the nationalquestion have been quite correctly outlined by the League. 
 These are, firstly, the demand for political and civil liber-ties and complete equality, rather than for national auton-omy; and, secondly, the demand for the right to self-determination for every nationality forming part of the state. 
But neither of these principles is as yet quite consistentlybrought out by the League of Armenian Social-Democrats. 
As a matter of fact, is it possible from the Armenian Social-Democrats ’ point of view to speak of the demand for a federa-tive republic? Federation presupposes autonomous national political units, whereas the League rejects the demand fornational autonomy. 
 To be fully consistent, the League shoulddelete the demand for a federative republic from its pro-gramme, confining itself to the demand for a democratic republic in general. 
 It is not the business of the proletariat to preach federalism and national autonomy; it is not the business of the proletariat to advance such demands, whichinevitably amount to a demand for the establishment of anautonomous class state. 
 It is the business of the proletariat to rally the greatest possible masses of workers of each and every nationality more closely , to rally them for struggle in the broadest possible arena for a democratic republic and for socialism. 
 And since the state arena in which we are work-ing today was created and is being maintained and extended by means of a series of outrageous acts of violence, then, to make the struggle against all forms of exploitation and op-pression successful, we must not disperse but unite the forcesof the working class , which is the most oppressed and the most capable of fighting. 
 The demand for recognition of every na-tionality’s right to self-determination simply implies thatwe, the party of the proletariat, must always and uncondition-ally oppose any attempt to influence national self-determi-nation from without by violence or injustice . 
 While at all times performing this negative duty of ours (to fight andprotest against violence), we on our part concern ourselveswith the self-determination of the proletariat in each nationality rather than with self-determination of peoples or nations. 
 Thus, the general, basic and ever-binding pro-gramme of Russian Social-Democracy must consist only in thedemand for equal rights for all citizens (irrespective of sex, lan-guage, creed, race, nationality, etc. 
) and for their right to freedemocratic self-determination. 
 As to support of the demand for national autonomy, it is by no means a permanent and bind-ing part of the programme of the proletariat. 
 This support may become necessary for it only in isolated and excep-tional cases. 
 With regard to Armenian Social-Democracy, theLeague of Armenian Social-Democrats has itself recognisedthe absence of such exceptional circumstances. 
 We hope to return to the question of federalism and nationality. 
 * For the time being we shall conclude by once again welcoming a new member of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party—the League of Armenian Social-Democrats.

 DOES THE JEWISH PROLETARIAT NEED AN “INDEPENDENT POLITICAL PARTY ”? No. 
 105 of Posledniye Izvestia (January 28/15, 1903), published by the Foreign Committee of the General Jewish Workers’ Union of Lithuania, Poland, and Russia, carries a brief article entitled “Concerning a Certain Manifesto”(viz. 
, the manifesto issued by the Ekaterinoslav Committeeof the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party) containingthe following statement, which is as extraordinary as itis significant and indeed “fraught with consequences”: “The Jewish proletariat has formed itself ( sic!) into an independent ( sic!) political party, the Bund. 
” We did not know this before. 
 This is something new. 
Hitherto the Bund has been a constituent part of the Rus-sian Social-Democratic Labour Party, and in No. 
 106 ofPosledniye Izvestia we still (still!) find a statement of the Central Committee of the Bund, bearing the heading “Rus-sian Social-Democratic Labour Party. 
” It is true that atits latest congress, the Fourth, the Bund decided to changeits name (without stipulating that it would like to hear theRussian comrades’ opinion on the name a section of theRussian Social-Democratic Labour Party should bear) and to “introduce” new federal relations into the Rules of the Russian Party. 
 The Bund’s Foreign Committee has even“introduced” these relations, if that word can be used todescribe the fact that it has withdrawn from the Union ofRussian Social-Democrats Abroad and has concluded a fed-eral agreement with the latter. 
 On the other hand, when Iskra polemised with the deci-sions of the Bund’s Fourth Congress, the Bund itself statedvery definitely that it only wanted to secure the acceptance of its wishes and decisions by the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
; in other words, it flatly and categorically acknowledged that until the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 adopted new Rules and settled new forms of its attitude towards the Bund, the latter would remain asection of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 But now, suddenly, we are told that the Jewish proletar-iat has already formed itself into an independent political party! We repeat—this is something new. 
 Equally new is the furious and foolish onslaught of the Bund’s Foreign Committee upon the Ekaterinoslav Commit-tee. 
 We have at last ( though unfortunately after much delay ) received a copy of this manifesto, and we do not hesitateto say that in attacking a manifesto like this the Bund has undoubtedly taken a serious political step. 
 * This step fully accords with the Bund’s proclamation as an independent political party and throws much light on the physiognomyand behaviour of this new party. 
 We regret that lack of space prevents us from reprinting the Ekaterinoslav manifesto in full (it would take up abouttwo columns in Iskra **), and shall confine ourselves to remarking that this admirable manifesto excellently ex-plains to the Jewish workers of the city of Ekaterinoslav (we shall presently explain why we have emphasised these words)the Social-Democratic attitude towards Zionism and anti-Semitism. 
 Moreover, the manifesto treats the sentiments,moods, and desires of the Jewish workers so considerately, with such comradely consideration, that it specially refers to and emphasises the necessity of fighting under thebanner of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 “ even for the preservation and further development of your [the manifesto addresses the Jewish workers] national culture ”, “even from the standpoint of purely national interests ” (underlined and italicised in the manifesto itself). 
 Nevertheless, the Bund’s Foreign Committee (we almost said the new party’s Central Committee) has fallen upon the *That is, of course, if the Bund’s Foreign Committee expresses the views of the Bund as a whole on this question. 
 **We intend to reprint in full the manifesto and the attack of the Bund’s Foreign Committee in a pamphlet which we are preparingfor the press. 
 manifesto for making no mention of the Bund . 
 That is the man-ifesto’s only crime, but one that is terrible and unpardon-able. 
 It is for this that the Ekaterinoslav Committee is accused of lacking in “political sense”. 
 The Ekaterinoslavcomrades are chastised for not “yet having digested the ideaof the necessity for a separate organisation [a profound andsignificant idea!] of the forces [!!l of the Jewish proletariat”,for “still harbouring the absurd hope of somehow getting rid of it” (the Bund), for spreading the “no less dangerous fable” (no less dangerous than the Zionist fable) that anti-Semitismis connected with the bourgeois strata and with their interests,and not with those of the working class. 
 That is why theEkaterinoslav Committee is advised to “abandon the harm-ful habit of keeping silent about the independent Jewish working-class movement” and to “reconcile itself to the fact that the Bund exists”. 
 Now, let us consider whether the Ekaterinoslav Com-mittee is actually guilty of a crime, and whether it reallyshould have mentioned the Bund without fail. 
 Both questionscan be answered only in the negative, for the simple reason that the manifesto is not addressed to the “Jewish workers” in general (as the Bund’s Foreign Committee quite wronglystated), but to “the Jewish workers of the city of Ekateri-noslav ” (the Bund’s Foreign Committee forgot to quote these last words!). 
 The Bund has no organisation in Ekaterinoslav. 
 (And, in general, regarding the south of Russia the Fourth Congress of the Bund passed a resolution not to organise separate committees of the Bund in cities where the Jewish organisations are included in the Party committees and wheretheir needs can be fully satisfied without separation from thecommittees. 
) Since the Jewish workers in Ekaterinoslavare not organised in a separate committee, it follows that their movement (inseparably from the entire working-class movement in that area) is wholly guided by the Ekaterino-slav Committee, which subordinates them directly to the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
, which must call upon them to work for the whole Party , and not for its individual sections. 
 It is clear that un-der these circumstances the Ekaterinoslav Committee was not obliged to mention the Bund; on the contrary, if it had pre-sumed to advocate “the necessity for a separate organisationof the forces [it would rather and more probably have been an organisation of impotence *] of the Jewish proletariat (which is what the Bundists want), it would have made a very grave error and committed a direct breach, not only of the Party Rules, but of the unity of the proletarian classstruggle. 
 Further, the Ekaterinoslav Committee is accused of lack of “orientation” in the question of anti-Semitism. 
 The Bund’sForeign Committee betrays truly infantile views on impor-tant social movements. 
 The Ekaterinoslav Committee speaks of the international anti-Semitic movement of the last decades and remarks that “from Germany this move-ment spread to other countries and everywhere found adher-ents among the bourgeois, and not among the working-class sections of the population”. 
 “This is a no less danger-ous fable” (than the Zionist fables), cries the thoroughly aroused Bund’s Foreign Committee. 
 Anti-Semitism “hasstruck roots in the mass of the workers”, and to prove thisthe “well-oriented” Bund cites two facts: 1) workers’ partic-ipation in a pogrom in Cz 8stochowa and 2) the behaviour of 12 (twelve !) Christian workers in Zhitomir, who scabbed on the strikers and threatened to “kill off all the Yids”. 
 Very weighty proofs indeed, especially the latter! The editors ofPosledniye Izvestia are so accustomed to dealing with big strikes involving five or ten workers that the behaviour oftwelve ignorant Zhitomir workers is dragged out as evidenceof the link between international anti-Semitism and one “section” or another “of the population”. 
 This is, indeed, magnificent! If, instead of flying into a foolish and comicalrage at the Ekaterinoslav Committee, the Bundists hadpondered a bit over this question and had consulted, let ussay, Kautsky’s pamphlet on the social revolution, 119 a Yiddish edition of which they themselves published-recently, they would have understood the link that undoubtedly exists *It is this task of “organising impotence” that the Bund serves when, for example, it uses such a phrase as “our comrades of the‘Christian working-class organisation’”. 
 The phrase is as preposterousas is the whole attack on the Ekaterinoslav Committee. 
 We have noknowledge of any “Christian” working-class organisations. 
 Organisa-tions belonging to the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 have never distinguished their mem-bers according to religion, never asked them about their religion and never will —even when the Bund will in actual fact “have formed itself into an independent political party”. 
 between anti-Semitism and the interests of the bourgeois, and not of the working-class sections of the population. 
 If they had given it a little more thought they might have realised that the social character of anti-Semitism today isnot changed by the fact that dozens or even hundreds ofunorganised workers, nine-tenths of whom are still quiteignorant, take part in a pogrom. 
 The Ekaterinoslav Committee has risen up (and rightly so) against the Zionist fable about anti-Semitism being eternal; by making its angry comment the Bund has onlyconfused the issue and planted in the minds of the Jewishworkers ideas which tend to blunt their class-consciousness. 
 From the viewpoint of the struggle for political lib-erty and for socialism being waged by the whole working class of Russia, the Bund’s attack on the Ekaterinoslav Committee is the height of folly. 
 From the viewpoint ofthe Bund as “an independent political party”, this attackbecomes understandable: don’t dare anywhere organise “Jew-ish” workers together with, and inseparably from, “Christian”workers! If you would address the Jewish workers in the name of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party or its com-mittees, don’t dare do so directly, over our heads, ignoringthe Bund or making no mention of it! And this profoundly regrettable fact is not accidental. 
 Having once demanded “federation” instead of autonomy inmatters concerning the Jewish proletariat, you were com-pelled to proclaim the Bund an “independent political party” in order to carry out this principle of federation at all costs . 
 However, your declaring the Bund an independent politicalparty is just that reduction to an absurdity of your funda-mental error in the national question which will inescapablyand inevitably be the starting-point of a change in the views of the Jewish proletariat and of the Jewish Social-Democrats in general. 
 “Autonomy” under the Rules adopted in 1898provides the Jewish working-class movement with all itneeds: propaganda and agitation in Yiddish, its own liter-ature and congresses, the right to advance separate demandsto supplement a single general Social-Democratic programme and to satisfy local needs and requirements arising out of the special features of Jewish life. 
 In everything else there mustbe complete fusion with the Russian proletariat, in the inter-ests of the struggle waged by the entire proletariat of Russia. 
 As for the fear of being “steam-rollered” in the event of such fusion, the very nature of the case makes it groundless, since it is autonomy that is a guarantee against all steam-roller-ing” in matters pertaining specifically to the Jewish move-ment, while in matters pertaining to the struggle againstthe autocracy, the struggle against the bourgeoisie of Rus-sia as a whole, we must act as a single and centralised mili-tant organisation, have behind us the whole of the proletariat, without distinction of language or nationality, a proletariatwhose unity is cemented by the continual joint solution ofproblems of theory and practice, of tactics and organisation;and we must not set up organisations that would marchseparately, each along its own track; we must not weaken the force of our offensive by breaking up into numerous independent political parties; we must not introduce estrange-ment and isolation and then have to heal an artificiallyimplanted disease with the aid of these notorious “federation”plasters.

 OUTLINE OF LECTURE ONE GENERAL THEORY Marx’s theory of the development of the capitalist mode of production applies to agriculture just as it doesto industry. 
 Capitalism’s basic features and its differentforms in agriculture and industry should not be confused. 
 Let us examine the characteristic basic features and the specific forms of the process which creates the capital-ist system in agriculture. 
 The cause of the appearanceof this process is a double one: 1) commodity productionand 2) the fact that labour-power, not the product, is acommodity. 
 When this labour-power is drawn into exchange,all production becomes capitalistic, and a special class, the proletariat, is created. 
 The growth of commodity pro-duction and the development of wage-labour in agricul-ture take place in a different form than in industry, andthe application of Marx’s theory here may therefore seemincorrect; it is, however, necessary to know the form inwhich agriculture becomes capitalistic. 
 To this end it is essential in the first place to establish two facts: I. 
 How does commercial agriculture grow? and II. 
 How does the formation of the working class mani-fest itself? I. 
 The basic feature of this process is the rapid growth of the industrial population and the sale of products on the market. 
 Hence, extensive growth of the non-agricul-tural population is necessary for the extensive developmentof commodity agriculture. 
 This process assumes different forms and is to be observed in countries which import and export grain. 
 On its part, the rapid growth of the indus-trial population creates a shortage of grain in the indus-trial countries, i. 
e. 
, makes it impossible to do withoutimported grain if the technological system remains un-changed. 
 The growing demand for grain under private owner-ship of the land leads to the formation of monopoly prices. 
 That is important for the explanation of rent. 
 The very process of the formation of commercial agri-culture does not take place in exactly the same way as in fac-tory industry: in industry it takes place in a simple and directform, whereas in agriculture we see something different:the prevalence of a mixture of commercial and non-com-mercial agriculture. 
 Here we have a combination of differ-ent forms. 
 In the main, in a given locality one definite product is taken to the market. 
 On the one hand, produc-tion on the landlord’s estate, and particularly on the pea-sant’s land, is commodity production, while on the otherhand it retains its consumer character. 
 The necessity to obtain money brings about the transition from natural to commercial economy. 
 The power of money weighs upon the peasants, not only in Western Europe, butin Russia too. 
 Zemstvo statistics show that the peasants’subordination to the market attains colossal proportionseven in places where the survivals of patriarchal economyare still very strong. 
 II. 
 The process by which the class of wage-workers is formed consists in the disintegration of the peasantry intotwo strata: 1) farmers who regard agriculture as an indus-try, and 2) wage-workers. 
 This process is often describedas the differentiation of the peasantry. 
 In Russia in par-ticular this process has been very conspicuous. 
 It was observed by “economists” as far back as the times of the feudal system. 
 Specific features of formation. 
This process takes place unevenly. 
 Alongside of the emergence of a class of wage-workers we see the existenceof the patriarchal system and the formation of the new, capitalist system. 
 The wage-workers’ class is connected with the land in one way or another: the forms of this pro-cess will consequently be very varied. 
 DOMINATION OF CAPITALIST AGRICULTURE Rent The population in a capitalist country is divided into three classes: 1) wage-workers, 2) owners of land, and 3) cap-italists. 
 In studying the system it will be necessary toignore specific local features where this distinct divisionmay not yet exist. 
 According to Marx, a product is basically divided into necessary and surplus-product. 
 A certain part of this sur-plus-product constitutes ground rent, viz. 
, that part whichremains after the deduction of average profit on capital. 
In a developed capitalist society, average profit is formedunder the influence of competition, which distributes the surplus-product among the capitalists, not in proportion to the number of workers, but in proportion to the totalamount of capital invested in a given enterprise. 
 The process of the formation of average profit is ana-lysed by Marx in Volume III of Capital . 
 Capital will yield different profits on plots of land with varying fertility, the poorer land yielding less profit, and the better land— more, additional profit. 
 (The theory of rent was foundedbefore Marx by Ricardo. 
) Owing to monopoly prices onthe grain market and the general shortage of grain, theprice is determined by the poorest plot of land. 
 The extraprofit derived from the better land, or from the land sit-uated close to the market, as compared with the poorer and more remotely situated plot, is called differential rent, according to Marx. 
 Rent is extracted from the farmers by the owners of land. 
The varying amounts of surplus-profit may be of two kinds: 1) profit due to varying fertility, and 2) profit due to differ-ent application of capital. 
 Further. 
 In addition to the monopoly of private cultivation of the land, there is themonopoly of private ownership of the land: the owner of landmay not give the land to the farmer until the price of grainrises, and then he takes absolute rent, which is an elemen-tary monopoly. 
 It may be: 1) a pure monopoly (in that case, strictly speaking, it should not be called rent). 
 Sec-ondly, absolute rent may be taken from surplus-profit onagrarian capital owing to the following circumstance. 
 In view of the fact that in agriculture the technical equipment is poorer, the share of variable capital ( =which creates profit) is higher than in industry. 
 The share of profit should therefore also be higher in agriculture than in industry. 
However, the monopoly of landownership prevents the lev-elling of high profit in agriculture and low profit in indus-try. 
 And absolute rent in the strict sense of the term istaken from the higher agricultural profit which has not been levelled out. 
 It has its source in higher grain prices. 
 Differ-ential rent, on the other hand, is taken from the product. 
Recent years, characterised by new countries being drawninto trade, have led to a crisis. 
 The price of land is calculated, anticipated rent. 
 It is therefore treated as income from a certain capital. 
 The capital to be spent on the purchase of land may yield an average rent income. 
 Consequently, the rapid developmentof industry has greatly inflated and stabilised rent inEurope. 
 A large section of Maslov’s book, recently published under the title Conditions of the Development of Agri-culture in Russia , deals with the theory of rent, and in this question Maslov adheres to an entirely erroneousviewpoint, repeating the arguments of the bourgeois so-called“critics” of Marx, such as Mr. 
 Bulgakov and others. 
Marx showed that the old English political economy tooktoo simple a view of this question; it was treated not as a process creating special historical conditions, but as one creating natural conditions, and it reasoned therefore:rent is formed owing to the necessity of transition fromthe better to the poorer plots of land. 
 But changes in thereverse direction also take place, inasmuch as improvementsare effected. 
 The critics have retreated from Marx to-wards bourgeois economy. 
 Another narrow concept of the theory of rent is one that combines the law governing the formation of differentialrent with the law of diminishing returns, which allegesthat profits diminish on one and the same plot of land. 
Ricardo explains the transition from the better plots to the poorer ones by the impossibility of applying increasing amounts of capital. 
 All the Russian “critics” have takenup the defence of the theory of diminishing returns, as has Maslov, who in all other questions wants to remain a Marx-ist. 
 But the arguments in defence of this theory have not gone beyond quips, as, for example, the one which claims that if this theory is not recognised then it must beadmitted that the returns of one plot of land should be enoughto feed a whole state. 
 Marx fought against this theory. 
 It adopts an arith-metical approach to the expenditure of capital and falls into error by ignoring general economic conditions. 
 If we assume that the application of ever greater amounts of cap-ital is always possible, then it would have been correct,but that presupposes the transformation of systems; however,systems in agriculture persist for ages, which has placedthe application of capital within definite limits. 
 If tech-niques do not change, then further application of capital is impossible, or possible within narrow limits. 
 Marxpointed out that in industry too production cannot be de-veloped infinitely on a given plot of land: if a definiteterritory is occupied by an enterprise, it has to be expandedif it is to be developed. 
 If, on the other hand, land is rationally cultivated, that can only improve production; therefore Marx deduces that, far from being a disadvantage,such use of the land is, on the contrary, profitable. 
 Pre-cisely this “ if” was ignored by the opponents of Marx’s theory. 
 Consequently, Maslov, as an alleged Marxist, canmislead many people by his views in this question. 
 His book is one of the countless examples of a tendency to be seen in our time: going back instead of forward. 
 There is an absolute decline in the agricultural popula-tion, but agricultural production is making progress. 
 Inthe nineteenth century this progress was closely connectedwith the growth of commodity agriculture. 
 It brings out one of the main features of the capitalist system today, which is expressed in the development of competition in agricul-ture, in the creation of a market for it, and in the differ-entiation of the population. 
 This progress has given astrong stimulus to the development of agriculture, butevery step in this progress has been attended by a rise of contradictions which make it impossible to use all the productive forces of the new, scientific agriculture. 
 Cap-italism creates large-scale production and competition, which are attended by rapacious use of the productive forces of the soil. 
 Concentration of the population in the cities creates depopulated territories and an abnormal metabolism! Cultivation of the land is not improved, ornot improved as it should be. 
 Socialist critics directed attention to this fact a long time ago (Marx). 
 Mr. 
 Hertz, and, later, Messrs. 
 Bulga-kov, Chernov, and Struve here in Russia maintained that the theory of Marx, who relied upon Liebig, had become anti-quated. 
 This opinion of the “critics” is quite fallacious. 
There is no doubt that capitalism has upset the equilibriumbetween the exploitation of the land and fertilisationof the land (the role of the separation of the town fromthe countryside). 
 With many writers who sympathise with the “criticism” of the Marxist theory rather than with this theory itself, their own data speak against them. 
 An exam-ple is Nossig. 
 According to his data, it would appear thatthe productive forces of the soil are not replenished, thatthe land does not get back what is taken from it. 
 Bothmanure and artificial fertilisers are required. 
 One-third of an average of 60,000 kilograms of fertilisers used per hec-tare of land should be made up of manure, but that cannotbe provided under the existing system of agriculture. 
 Thus, the influence of capitalism in agriculture is ex-pressed in the following: It demands freedom for the wage-worker and ousts all forms of the old bondage. 
 But the agricultural wage-workers remain oppressed. 
 Their oppression has become greater,which has created the need for greater struggle. 
 Capitalism has increased to a tremendous degree the trib-ute exacted by the owner of land, the magnitude of differen-tial and absolute rent. 
 The further development of agri-culture is hampered by inflated rent. 
 THE AUTOCRACY IS WAVERING.... 
 The autocracy is wavering. 
 The autocrat himself pub-licly admits this to the people. 
 That is the enormous signif-icance of the tsar’s Manifesto of February 26, and no amount of conventional phrases, none of the reservationsor subterfuges the Manifesto abounds in, can alter the his-toric importance of the step that has been taken. 
 The tsar begins in the old way— as yet in the old way: “by the grace of God” ... and concludes with a half-coward-ly, half-hypocritical appeal for help addressed to people invested with public confidence . 
 The tsar himself already feels that the days when government in Russia could main-tain itself by the grace of God are passing never to returnand that henceforth the only stable government Russia canhave is government by the will of the people . 
 The tsar reaffirms his sacred vow to safeguard the age-old pillars of the Russian Empire. 
 Translated into Russianfrom the language of officialdom, this means: to safeguardthe autocracy. 
 Alexander III once declared that openlyand without circumlocution (in the Manifesto of April 29,1881), when the revolutionary movement was receding and dwindling. 
 Today, when the battle-cry “Down with the autocracy” is resounding ever more loudly and impres-sively, Nicholas II prefers to cover his declaration witha small fig-leaf and to make a modest reference to his unfor-gettable progenitor. 
 A senseless and contemptible stratagem!The question of whether or not the autocracy is to be has been raised point-blank and carried into the streets. 
 And every promise of “reforms”—if they may be called “reforms”!—that begins with a promise to preserve the autocracy is a glaring lie, a mockery of the Russian people. 
 But there is nothing that could serve to expose the government in the eyes of the whole people better than this governmental appeal to the people with hypocritical and false prom-ises. 
 The tsar speaks (again using a fig-leaf) about the revolutionary movement, complaining that “sedition” in-terferes with the work of improving public welfare, agitates minds, tears the people away from productive labour, ruins forces dear to the heart of the tsar, ruinsthe youthful forces indispensable to the fatherland. 
And so, since the ruined participants in the revolution-ary movement are dear to the tsar’s heart, therefore h e at once promises to ruthlessly suppress every deviation from the normal course of social life, i. 
e. 
, to brutally per-secute free speech, workers’ strikes, and popular demon-strations. 
 That is enough, more than enough. 
 This Jesuitical speech speaks for itself. 
 We merely make so bold as to expressthe conviction that by being spread throughout the length and breadth of Russia this “tsarist pledge” will act as most splendid propaganda in favour of revolutionarydemands. 
 There is only one answer that this pledge of thetsar’s can evoke from anyone who has the least spark ofhonour left in him: the demand for the immediate and uncon-ditional release of all persons who have been imprisoned, exiled or arrested—with or without trial, before or after sentence has been passed—for political or religious con-siderations, or because of strike activities or resistance tothe authorities. 
 We have seen the hypocrisy of the tsar’s speech. 
 Let us now see what he speaks about. 
 He speaks mainly about three things. 
 First, about tol-erance. 
 Our fundamental laws which guarantee freedomof worship for all faiths are to be confirmed and upheld. 
But the Russian Orthodox Church shall remain dominant. 
Secondly, the tsar speaks about a revision of legislationrelating to rural affairs, about people who enjoy public confidence taking part in this revision, and about joint efforts on the part of all his subjects to raise moral standardsin the family, the school, and public life. 
 Thirdly, about making it easier for the peasants to leave their village communes, about releasing the peasants from the restric-tions of collective liability. 
 In answer to Nicholas II’s three declarations, prom-ises, and proposals, Russian Social-Democracy replies withthree demands which it long ago raised, and has alwaysdefended and popularised to the best of its ability, andwhich we must now reaffirm most emphatically in connection with the tsar’s Manifesto and in answer to it. 
 First, we demand the immediate and unconditional rec-ognition by law of the freedom of assembly, freedom ofthe press, and an amnesty for all “political prisoners” andmembers of religious sects. 
 Until that is done, all talkabout tolerance and freedom of worship will remain a miserable pretence and a discreditable lie. 
 Until freedom of assembly, speech, and the press is proclaimed, there willbe no end to the shameful Russian inquisition, which houndsthe profession of officially unsanctioned faiths, opinions,and doctrines. 
 Down with the censorship! Down with policeand gendarme protection of the “established” church! For these demands the class-conscious proletariat of Russia will fight to the last drop of blood. 
 Secondly, we demand the convocation of a national Constituent Assembly which will be elected by all citizenswithout exception and will establish an elective form ofgovernment in Russia. 
 Enough of this game of conferences of local people, of landlords’ parliaments under the gover-nors, of representative government by the Marshals (andperhaps by the delegates as well?) of the Nobility! Enoughof this cat-and-mouse game which the all-powerful official-dom has been playing with all kinds of Zemstvos, now lettingthem go, now stroking them with its velvet paws! Until a national assembly of deputies is called, all talk of public confidence and moral standards in public life will be apack of lies. 
 Until then the Russian working class willnot abate its revolutionary struggle against the Russianautocracy. 
 Thirdly, we demand the immediate and unconditional recognition by law of the full equality of the peasants with all other social-estates, and the convocation of peasant committees for the abolition of all remnants of serfdom in the countryside and the adoption of serious measures to improve the conditions of the peasantry. 
 The absence of rights for the peasantry, which constitutes nine-tenths of the population of Russia, cannot be tol-erated a day longer. 
 The entire working class and the en-tire country are suffering from this absence of rights; itis on this that all the Asiatic backwardness in Russianlife rests; it is owing to this absence of rights that all the various conferences and commissions produce no results (or are injurious to the peasants ). 
 Now, too, the tsar wants to escape by invoking the former “conferences” ofbureaucrats and noblemen; he even speaks of “strong govern-ment” to guide the efforts of the local forces. 
 The peasantsknow full well from the example of the rural superintendents what this “strong government” means. 
 Not in vain have the peasants endured forty years of poverty, want andconstant starvation after the benefactions bestowed onthem by the committees of nobles. 
 Now the peasants willunderstand that all “reforms” and improvements will re-main a sham if they are not put into effect by the peasants themselves . 
 The peasants will understand—and we shall help them to understand—that only peasant committees are capable of really abolishing not only collective lia-bility but all survivals of the corvée system and serfdom,which are still oppressing tens of millions of people rightinto the twentieth century. 
 Freedom of assembly and free-dom of the press are quite enough for the urban workers: we shall be able to make good use of these liberties!! But forthe peasants, scattered in out-of-the-way places, and cowedand reduced to a state of barbarism, this is not enough—andthe workers must help them, must explain to them that theywill unavoidably and inescapably remain miserable slaves until they take their destiny into their own hands, until they take their first and most important step and achievethe establishment of peasant committees for real and not sham emancipation of the peasantry. 
 Intelligent and experienced people have long observed that there is no more precarious moment for a government in a revolutionary period than the beginning of concessions, the beginning of waverings. 
 Russian political life of thelast few years has brilliantly confirmed this. 
 The govern-ment began to waver on the question of the working-class movement, giving a free hand to Zubatovism—and made a laughing-stock of itself, playing splendidly into the hands of revolutionary agitation. 
 The government wanted to makeconcessions on the student question—and made a laughing-stock of itself, advancing the revolutionisation of the stu-dents by seven-league strides. 
 The government is nowrepeating on a large scale the very same method with re-gard to all questions of home policy—and it will inevitably make a laughing-stock of itself, inevitably facilitate,strengthen and add impetus to the revolutionary onslaughton the autocracy! * * * There is still another question we must deal with, and that is the practical question of how to use the tsar’s Man-ifesto of February 26 for purposes of agitation. 
 The Rus-sian Social-Democrats long ago answered the question asto the means of struggle by saying: organisation and agita-tion; neither were they put out by the jeers of naïve people who considered this “indefinite”, and held that the only “definite” means were pistol shots. 
 And now, at a momentlike the present, when such a welcome cue for conductingagitation on a nation-wide scale unexpectedly presentsitself, one which so urgently demands the exertion of ourevery effort—at such a moment, a deficiency, the old self-same deficiency in organisation, in ability rapidly to set our agitation going, makes itself felt more keenly than ever. 
 But we shall yet make up for lost time, make up for it many times over! First of all, we must reply to the Manifesto of February 26 with leaflets published by central and local Party organisations. 
 Whereas hitherto leaflets were issued in tens of thousands for all Russia, they should now be dis-tributed in millions, so that the whole people may learnof the answer of the class-conscious Russian proletariat tothe tsar’s appeal to the people, so that all may see our def-inite, practical demands in juxtaposition with the speech of the tsar on the same subject . 
 Further. 
 We must not allow reverential raptures of legal meetings of well-intentioned Zemstvoists and noblemen, /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR merchants and professors, etc. 
, etc. 
, to be the only reply to the Manifesto of February 26. 
 Nor will the replies that Social-Democratic organisations will give in their leaflets prove sufficient. 
 Let every study circle , every meet-ing of workers draw up its own answer and ratify formally and solemnly the demands of Social-Democracy. 
 Let thedecisions of these workers’ meetings (and, if possible, alsoof peasants’ meetings) be published in local leaflets and reported in our press. 
 Let all know that we consider answers from the workers and peasants themselves the only answerfrom the people. 
 And let all study circles begin to prepareimmediately to back up our fundamental demands with force . 
 Moreover, we must not allow messages of gratitude to the tsar to be drawn up at all sorts of meetings, without counteraction. 
 Our liberals have falsified Russian publicopinion long enough! Long enough have they lied, sayingnot what they themselves think, or what the entire rea-soning and militant section of the people thinks! We mustendeavour to get into their meetings, declare our opin-ion there, too, as widely, publicly and openly as possible, voice our protest against servile gratitude, give our real answer to the tsar, and declare it by distributing leafletsas well as by speaking publicly, whenever possible, at allsuch meetings (even though the chairmen will try to stopsuch speeches). 
 Finally, we must try to bring the answer of the workers out on to the street, to broadcast our demands through dem-onstrations, and to show publicly the numbers and strengthof the workers, their class-consciousness and determination. 
Let the coming May Day celebration be not only a generaldeclaration of our proletarian demands, but also a special and definite answer to the Manifesto of February 26! Iskra , No. 
 35, March 1, 1903 Published according to the Iskra text MR. 
 STRUVE EXPOSED BY HIS COLLEAGUE No. 
 17 of Osvobozhdeniye produced much that is gratify-ing to Iskra in general, and to the author of these lines in particular. 
 To Iskra because it was gratifying for it to see that its endeavours to push Mr. 
 Struve to the Lefthad yielded some result; it was gratifying to see Mr. 
 S. 
 S. 
indulging in sharp criticism of half-heartedness, grati-fying to read about the intention of the Osvobozhdeniye peo-ple to create “openly and definitely a constitutional party” with a programme demanding universal suffrage. 
 To the author of these lines because Mr. 
 S. 
 S. 
—“who took aprominent part” in drawing up the declaration “of theRussian constitutionalists” in No. 
 1 of Osvobozhdeniye , and hence is no mere collaborator, but to some extent the master of Mr. 
 Struve—has unexpectedly rendered us a great service in our polemic against Mr. 
 Struve . 
 I shall take the liberty of beginning with this second point. 
 No. 
 2-3 of Zarya car-ried an article of mine entitled “The Persecutors of theZemstvo and the Hannibals of Liberalism”, * in which I polemised against Mr. 
 R. 
 N. 
 S. 
, who had written a pref-ace to the well-known Witte memorandum. 
 In this article I revealed the ambiguity of the entire stand taken by Mr. 
 R. 
 N. 
 S. 
, when he spoke of his Hannibal vow to fight againstthe autocracy and at the same time addressed unctuousspeeches to the powers that be, to the sage conservatives,at the same time advancing the “formula” of “Rights, andan Authoritative Zemstvo”, etc. 
, etc. 
 Now that the second edition of the “Memorandum” has appeared, the public has learned that this Mr. 
 R. 
 N. 
 S. 
 is—Mr. 
 Struve. 
 Mr. 
Struve was highly displeased with my criticism, and hecame down heavily on me with his extremely lengthyand extremely irate “Note to a Note”. 
 Let us examine Mr. 
 Struve’s arguments. 
 The first example of the “groundlessness and injustice” *See present edition, Vol. 
 5. 
— Ed. 
 of my “polemical masterpiece” is that I spoke about Mr. 
 Struve’s antipathy against revolutionaries, despite his “alleged absolutely clear statement”. 
 Let me cite this state-ment in full. 
 “The testimonial presented to the Zemstvoby the bureaucracy itself,” Mr. 
 Struve wrote, “is an excel-lent reply to all those who, because of an inadequate polit-ical education or because they are carried away by revolu-tionary phrases, refused and persist in refusing to see the great political importance of the Russian Zemstvos and their legal cultural activity. 
” In a note to this tirade, Mr. 
Struve made the reservation: “By these words we do notintend in the least to give offence to the revolutionaries,to whom credit must be accorded above all for their moralcourage in the struggle against despotism. 
” These are the “documents in the case” of groundless and unjust criticism. 
 We leave it to the reader to judgewho is right: the person who found this statement absolute-ly clear, or the person who has found that Mr. 
 Struve hasonly made matters worse by “giving offence” to revolutiona-ries ( without naming them concretely ), not only with the “anon-ymous” charge of ignorance (it is not known against whom it is levelled), but also with the assumption that they can bemade to swallow the pill of an accusation of ignorance ifonly it is gilded with recognition of their “moral courage”. 
 For my part, I shall merely remark that tastes differ. 
 Many liberals consider it the height of tact and wisdom to present the revolutionaries with testimonials to their cour-age, at the same time treating their programme as merephrase-mongering, as a sign of an inadequate education,without even analysing the substance of their views. 
 To our way of thinking, this is neither tact nor wisdom, but a pieceof discreditable evasion. 
 It is a matter of taste. 
 The Russian Thiers, of course, appreciate the genteel drawing room parlance, the irreproachably parliamentarian opportunist phrase-mongering of the real Thiers. 
 To proceed. 
 I, if you please, “pretended not to under-stand that the formula ‘an Authoritative all-Russian Zems-tvo’ signifies the demand for a constitution”, and my argu-ments on this score “confirm once more [so Mr. 
 Struve thinks] the widespread occurrence of real revolutionary phrase-mongering, and malevolently biased phrase-mongering at that, in our literature issued abroad [this disgusting literary style is particularly rife in the columns of Iskra and Zarya ]”, p. 
 xii of the second edition of the “Memoran-dum”. 
 Well, as to being malevolently biased, it is difficultfor us to dispute this point with Mr. 
 Struve: what to himis a reproach we consider a compliment. 
 What the liberalsand many radicals call bias is actually unshakable firmnessof conviction, while sharp criticism of erroneous views is termed “malevolent” by them. 
 There is nothing to be done about it. 
 Mea culpa , mea maxima culpa! I have been and shall continue to be “malevolently biased” against Messrs. 
the Struves. 
 Then there is the other charge—on a matterof fact. 
 Did I pretend not to understand or did I actuallyfail to understand, and was it impossible to understand? That is the question. 
 I maintained that the formula “Rights, and an Authori-tative Zemstvo” means unseemly playing up to the politicalprejudices of the broad mass of Russian liberals, that thisis “not a banner that can serve to distinguish enemies from allies ” (take note of this!), but “a rag which can only help to attract the most unreliable characters to the movement” (p. 
 95 in No. 
 2-3 of Zarya ). 
 * Let me ask all and sundry: where is there any “pretence” on my part here?? I franklystate my opinion that this is not a banner but a rag, andI get the answer: you are pretending not to understand!This is indeed nothing but a new attempt to avoid an anal-ysis of the question in essence , the question whether the “formula” is best fit to be a banner or a rag! Nor is that all. 
 Thanks to the kind assistance of Mr. 
 S. 
 S. 
, I am now able to adduce facts to prove something much more important. 
 I can prove that there was “unseemlyplaying up” on the part of Mr. 
 Struve, not only in the sense of philistine doctrinairism intended to move the gov-ernment with its modesty, not only in the sense of anirrational desire to unite the “liberals” around a minimum,but also in the sense of open and direct “playing up ” to supporters of the autocracy who are well known at such toMr. 
 Struve . 
 Mr. 
 S. 
 S. 
 exposes Mr. 
 Struve mercilessly and irretrievably by saying that the “obscure and ambiguous *See present edition, Vol. 
 5. 
— Ed. 
 [mark that!] Slavophil slogan of the ‘Zemsky Sobor’”121 is being advanced to suit the purposes of the “unnatural alliance” between the liberal constitutionalists and the liberal advocates of an ideal autocracy. 
 Mr. 
 S. 
 S. 
 says thatthis is no more and no less than “political juggling”!! AndMr. 
 Struve acknowledges receipt ... by terming the sloganof a Zemsky Sobor “vague and valuable by very reason of its vagueness [italics ours!] and at the same time dangerous. 
” Pretty good, isn’t it? When a Social-Democrat called an even more ambiguous slogan (an Authoritative Zemstvo) unseemly playing up, Mr. 
 Struve donned the mantle ofinjured innocence and spoke in mincing accents about a pre-tended failure to understand. 
 But when a liberal, Mr. 
 S. 
 S. 
,repeated the very same thing , Mr. 
 Struve made grateful obei-sance and acknowledged receipt! By reason of its very vagueness, a vague slogan was of value to Mr. 
 Struve, who is not embarrassed in the least to admit that he is pre-pared to launch dangerous slogans as well, depending on the way the wind blows . 
 If Mr. 
 Shipov appears to be strong and influential, then the editor of this liberal newspaper will speak about an Authoritative Zemstvo. 
 If Mr. 
 S. 
 S. 
 ap-pears to be strong and influential, then the editor of this lib-eral newspaper will speak about a constitution anduniversal suffrage! Not a bad picture of the political prac-tices and political ethics in the liberal camp.... 
 Mr. 
 Struveforgets only to consider what value his statements will have after this magnificent metamorphosis: in January 1901 Mr. 
 Struve demanded “Rights, and an AuthoritativeZemstvo”; in December 1902 Mr. 
 Struve declared that itwas a “pretence” not to understand that this was a demandfor a constitution; in February 1903 Mr. 
 Struve stated that inessence he had never questioned the justice of universal suffrage and that the vague slogan of a Zemsky Sobor was valuable just because it was vague. 
 The question arises:what right now has any person active in politics, any Russian citizen, to assert that tomorrow Mr. 
 Struve will not launch a new slogan “valuable by very reason of its vagueness ”?? Let us pass to the last point of Mr. 
 Struve’s reply. 
 “Is it not revolutionary phrase-mongering,” he asks, “or abso-lutely lifeless doctrinairism for Mr. 
 T. 
 P. 
122 to argue that the Zemstvo is an instrument for strengthening the autocracy?” Mr. 
 Struve sees in this an assimilation of the ideas of the Slavophils, agreement with Goremykin,123 and the Herculean pillars of a lifeless doctrine. 
 Mr. 
 Struve is absolutely incapable of understanding the revolutionary attitude towards half-hearted reforms undertaken for thepurpose of avoiding a revolution . 
 To Mr. 
 Struve every ref-erence to the double game played by the reformers fromabove appears to be Slavophilism and reaction, just as all the European Yves Guyots declare the socialist criticism of private property to be reactionary! It is, of course, notsurprising that once Mr. 
 Struve has become a reformer, he has lost the ability to understand the dual nature ofreforms and their significance as an instrument to strength-en the domination of the rulers, strengthen it at the price of granting reforms. 
 But ... there was a time when Mr. 
 Struve understood this amazingly cunning manoeuvre. 
That was long ago, when he was “a bit of a Marxist”, andwhen we fought together against the Narodniks in the col-umns of the now defunct Novoye Slovo . 
 124 In the July 1897 issue of this periodical, Mr. 
 Struve wrote about N. 
 V. 
 Vo-dovozov: “I remember a conversation we had in the street in 1890—I had just returned from a summer trip throughGermany, full of new and strong impressions—a conversa-tion on Wilhelm II’s social policy and plans of reform. 
 Vo-dovozov attached importance to them and did not agreewith me, to whom the question of the significance of the fact and idea of the so-called ‘social monarchy’ was at that time (and so much the more so at present) decided onceand for all in the negative. 
 Vodovozov viewed the idea o f social reform in the abstract, divorced from the real socialforces that create it. 
 That is why he considered Catholicsocialism in the main a peculiar ideological movement in favour of social reform and not a specific form of preven-tative reaction to the growing working-class movement onthe part of the European bourgeoisie, and partly also ofthe remnants of European feudalism.... 
” So you see: in thedistant past, at the time of his youthful infatuations,Mr. 
 Struve understood that reforms may be a preventative reaction, i. 
e. 
, a measure to prevent the ruling classes from falling, and directed against the revolutionaryclass, even though it does improve the condition of this class. 
 I put it to the reader: who, then, is right? Was it “revolutionary phrase-mongering” I indulged in when I exposed the reformist one-sidedness of Mr. 
 Struve’s atti-tude towards a reform such as the Zemstvo, or has Mr. 
 Struvebecome wiser and abandoned “once and for all” the position of a revolutionary which he at one time defended (allegedlyonce and for all)? Have I become a champion of the Slavo-phils and Goremykin, or did the “strong impressions” of his trip through socialist Germany last Mr. 
 Struve only a few years?? Yes, indeed, there are different conceptions of the strength of impressions, of the force of convictions, of the signifi-cance of convictions, of the compatibility of political ethicsand political conviction with the launching of slogans which are valuable by reason of their vagueness.... 
 In conclusion I cannot but remark on several state-ments of Mr. 
 Struve’s that considerably “mar” the pleasantimpression produced by his turn to the Left. 
 Although he hasadvanced only one democratic demand (universal suffrage)Mr. 
 Struve is already making haste to speak of a “liberal democratic party”. 
 Is this not somewhat premature? Would it not be better first to definitely indicate all the demo-cratic transformations which the Party demands uncondi-tionally not only in the agrarian and workers programme but in the political programme as well, and only then to paste on a label, only then claim promotion from the “rank” of liberal to the rank of liberal democrat? After all, uni-versal suffrage is a minimum of democracy that has been recognised even by some conservatives who (in Europe)have become reconciled to elections in general. 
 But for somereason or other, Mr. 
 Struve does not go beyond this mini-mum either in No. 
 17 or in No. 
 18. 
 Further, we shall note, in passing, Mr. 
 Struve’s curious remark that the prob-lem of socialism must be put entirely aside by the liberaldemocratic party “primarily because socialism is actuallyonly a problem so far”. 
 Is it not, most esteemed Mr. 
 Struve,because the “liberal democratic” elements of Russian societyexpress the interests of the classes that oppose the social-ist demands of the proletariat? I repeat, this is said merely in passing, in order to note the new methods used by the liberals to “negate” socialism. 
 Actually, of course, Mr. 
 Struve is right when he says that the liberal “demo-cratic” party is not a socialist party and that it would not be fitting for it to pose as such. 
 As to the tactics of the new party, Mr. 
 Struve could not have expressed himself more vaguely. 
 That is veryregrettable. 
 And it is even more regrettable that herepeats again and again, and stresses the necessity of “two-in-one” tactics in the sense of a “skilful, flexible and indissoluble combination” of legal and illegal methods of action. 
 At best, this is an evasion of the urgent questionsconnected with the methods of illegal activities. 
 And this is a pressing question because it is only systematic illegalactivity that actually determines the physiognomy ofthe party . 
 At worst, this is a repetition of the wriggling used by Mr. 
 Struve when he wrote about “Rights, and an Authoritative Zemstvo”, and not about an openly anddefinitely constitutional and “democratic” party. 
 Everyillegal party “combines” illegal with legal activities in the sense that it relies on the masses, who do not participate directly in illegal activities, that it supports legal pro-tests, utilises legal opportunities for propaganda, organi-sation, etc. 
 This is generally known, and it is not this thatis meant when the tactics of an illegal party are discussed. 
 The point in question is the irrevocable recognition ofstruggle by this party, elaboration of methods of struggle, the duty of party members not to limit themselves to legal protests, but to subordinate everything without exception to the interests and demands of the revolutionary struggle . 
 If there is no systematic illegal activity and revolutionarystruggle, then there is no party that can really be consti-tutional (let alone democratic). 
 And no greater harm can be done to the cause of the struggle than by confusing revo-lutionary work, which is based on the broad masses, makes use of mass organisations, and facilitates the political train-ing of legal party functionaries, with work restricted within legal bounds.

 THE STRUGGLE OF THE URBAN WORKERS Many peasants have probably already heard about the labour unrest in the towns. 
 Some of them have themselvesbeen in the capitals and in the factories, and have seen theriots, as the police call them. 
 Others know workers who were involved in the unrest and were deported to their villages by the authorities. 
 Others again must have seenthe leaflets issued by the workers, or pamphlets about theworkers’ struggle. 
 Still others have only heard storiesabout what is going on in the towns from people withfirst-hand experience. 
 Formerly, only students rebelled, but now thousands and tens of thousands of workers have risen in all the bigtowns. 
 In most cases they fight against their employers,against the factory owners, against the capitalists. 
 Theworkers declare strikes, all of them stop work at a factoryat the same time and demand higher wages, demand that they should be made to work not eleven or ten hours a day, but only eight hours. 
 The workers also demand other thingsthat would make the working man’s life easier. 
 They wantthe workshops to be in better condition and the machines tobe protected by special devices so as to prevent them frommaiming the workers; they want their children to be able to go to school and the sick to be given proper aid in the hospitals; they want the workers’ homes to be like humandwellings instead of being like pigsties. 
 The police intervene in the workers’ struggle. 
 The po-lice seize workers, throw them into prison, deport themwithout trial to their villages, or even to Siberia. 
 The government has passed laws banning strikes and workers’ meetings. 
 But the workers wage their fight against thepolice and against the government. 
 The workers say: We, millions of working people, have bent our backs long enough! We have worked for the rich and remained paupers long enough! We have allowed them to rob us long enough! We want to unite in unions, to unite all the workers in onebig workers’ union (a workers’ party ) and to strive jointly for a better life. 
 We want to achieve a new and betterorder of society: in this new and better society there mustbe neither rich nor poor; all will have to work. 
 Not a hand-ful of rich people, but all the working people must enjoy the fruits of their common labour. 
 Machines and other im-provements must serve to ease the work of all and not toenable a few to grow rich at the expense of millions andtens of millions of people. 
 This new and better society iscalled socialist society . 
 The teachings about this society are called socialism . 
 The workers’ unions which fight for this better order of society are called Social-Democratic parties. 
 Such parties exist openly in nearly all countries(except Russia and Turkey), and our workers, togetherwith socialists from among the educated people, have alsoformed such a party: the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party. 
 The government persecutes that Party, but it exists in secret, despite all prohibitions; it publishes its newspa-pers and pamphlets and organises secret unions. 
 The work-ers not only meet in secret but come out into the streetsin crowds and unfurl their banners bearing the inscrip-tions: “Long live the eight-hour day! Long live freedom! Long live socialism!” The government savagely persecutesthe workers for this. 
 It even sends troops to shoot downthe workers. 
 Russian soldiers have killed Russian workersin Yaroslavl, St. 
 Petersburg, Riga, Rostov-on-Don, andZlatoust. 
 But the workers do not yield. 
 They continue the fight. 
 They say: neither persecution, prison, deportation, penalservitude, nor death can frighten us. 
 Our cause is a justone. 
 We are fighting for the freedom and the happiness ofall who work. 
 We are fighting to free tens and hundreds ofmillions of people from abuse of power, oppression and poverty. 
 The workers are becoming more and more class-conscious. 
 The number of Social-Democrats is growing fastin all countries. 
 We shall win despite all persecution. 
 The rural poor must clearly understand who these Social-Democrats are, what they want, and what must be done in the countryside to help the Social-Democrats to win happiness for the people. 
 2. 
 WHAT DO THE SOCIAL-DEMOCRATS WANT? The Russian Social-Democrats are first and foremost striving to win political liberty . 
 They need political lib-erty in order to unite all the Russian workers extensivelyand openly in the struggle for a new and better socialistorder of society. 
 What is political liberty?To understand this the peasant should first compare his present state of freedom with serfdom. 
 Under the serf-own-ing system the peasant could not marry without the land-lord’s permission. 
 Today the peasant is free to marry withoutanyone’s permission. 
 Under the serf-owning system thepeasant had unfailingly to work for his landlord on daysfixed by the latter’s bailiff. 
 Today the peasant is free to decide which employer to work for, on which days, and for what pay. 
 Under the serf-owning system the peasantcould not leave his village without the landlord’s permis-sion. 
 Today the peasant is free to go wherever he pleases—if the mir allows him to go, if he is not in arrears with his taxes, if he can get a passport, and if the governor or the police chief does not forbid his changing residence. 
 Thus, even today the peasant is not quite free to go wherehe pleases; he does not enjoy complete freedom of move-ment; the peasant is still a semi-serf. 
 Later on we shallexplain in detail why the Russian peasant is still a semi-serf and what he must do to escape from this condition. 
 Under the serf-owning system the peasant had no right to acquire property without the landlord’s permission; hecould not buy land. 
 Today the peasant is free to acquireany kind of property (but even today he is not quite freeto leave the mir; he is not quite free to dispose of his land as he pleases). 
 Under the serf-owning system the peasant could be flogged by order of the landlord. 
 Today the peas-ant cannot be flogged by order of the landlord, althoughhe is still liable to corporal punishment. 
 This freedom is called civil liberty—freedom in family matters, in private matters, in matters concerning prop-erty. 
 The peasant and the worker are free (although not quite) to arrange their family life and their private affairs,to dispose of their labour (choose their employer) and theirproperty. 
 But neither the Russian workers nor the Russian people as a whole are yet free to arrange their public affairs. 
 The people as a whole are the serfs of the government officials, just as the peasants were the serfs of the landlords. 
 TheRussian people have no right to choose their officials, noright to elect representatives to legislate for the wholecountry. 
 The Russian people have not even the right toarrange meetings for the discussion of state affairs. 
 We dare not even print newspapers or books, and dare not even speak to all and for all on matters concerning the wholestate without permission from officials who have been putin authority over us without our consent, just as the landlordused to appoint his bailiff without the consent of the peasants! Just as the peasants were the slaves of the landlords, so the Russian people are still the slaves of the officials. 
 Just as the peasants lacked civil freedom under the serf-owning system, so the Russian people still lack political liberty. 
 Political liberty means the freedom of the peopleto arrange their public, state affairs. 
 Political libertymeans the right of the people to elect their representatives (deputies) to a State Duma (parliament). 
 All laws should be discussed and passed, all taxes should be fixed only bysuch a State Duma (parliament) elected by the people them-selves. 
 Political liberty means the right of the people them-selves to choose all their officials, arrange all kinds of meet-ings for the discussion of all state affairs, and publish whatever papers and books they please, without having to ask for permission. 
 All the other European peoples won political liberty for themselves long ago. 
 Only in Turkey and in Russia arethe people still politically enslaved by the sultan’s gov-ernment and by the tsarist autocratic government. 
 Tsarist autocracy means the unlimited power of the tsar. 
 The people have no voice in determining the structure of the state or inrunning it. 
 All laws are made and all officials are appointed by the tsar alone, by his personal, unlimited, autocratic authority. 
 But, of course, the tsar cannot even know all Russian laws and all Russian officials. 
 The tsar cannot even know all that goes on in the country. 
 The tsar simply endorsesthe will of a few score of the richest and most high-bornofficials. 
 However much he may desire to, one man cannotgovern a vast country like Russia. 
 It is not the tsar whogoverns Russia—it is only a manner of speech to talk about autocratic, one-man rule! Russia is governed by a handful of the richest and most high-born officials. 
 The tsar learnsonly what this handful are pleased to tell him. 
 The tsarcannot in any way go against the will of this handful ofhigh-ranking nobles: the tsar himself is a landlord anda member of the nobility; since his earliest childhood he has lived only among these high-born people; it was they who brought him up and educated him; he knows about theRussian people as a whole only that which is known to thesenoble gentry, these rich landlords, and the few very richmerchants who are received at the tsar’s Court. 
 In every volost administration office you will find the same picture hanging on the wall; it depicts the tsar (Alex-ander III, the father of the present tsar) speaking to thevolost headmen who have come to his coronation. 
 “ Obey your Marshals of the Nobility! ” the tsar is ordering them. 
 And the present tsar, Nicholas II, has repeated those words. 
Thus, the tsars themselves admit that they can govern the country only with the aid of the nobility and through the nobility. 
 We must well remember those words of the tsar’sabout the peasants having to obey the nobility. 
 We mustclearly understand what a lie is being told the people bythose who try to make out that tsarist government is thebest form of government. 
 In other countries—those people say—the government is elected; but it is the rich who are elected, and they govern unjustly and oppress the poor. 
 InRussia the government is not elected; an autocratic tsargoverns the whole country. 
 The tsar stands above everyone,rich and poor. 
 The tsar, they tell us, is just to everyone,to the poor and to the rich alike. 
 Such talk is sheer hypocrisy. 
 Every Russian knows the kind of justice that is dispensed by our government. 
Everybody knows whether a plain worker or a farm labourer in our country can become a member of the State Council. 
 In all other European countries, however, factory workers and farm-hands have been elected to the State Duma (par-liament); they have been able to speak freely to all thepeople about the miserable condition of the workers, andcall upon the workers to unite and fight for a better life. 
And no one has dared to stop these speeches of the people’srepresentatives; no policeman has dared to lay a finger on them. 
 In Russia there is no elective government, and she is governed not merely by the rich and the high-born, but bythe worst of these. 
 She is governed by the most skilfulintriguers at the tsar’s Court, by the most artful tricksters,by those who carry lies and slanders to the tsar, and flatter and toady to him. 
 They govern in secret; the people do not and cannot know what new laws are being drafted,what wars are being hatched, what new taxes are beingintroduced, which officials are being rewarded and for whatservices, and which are being dismissed. 
 In no countryis there such a multitude of officials as in Russia. 
 These officials tower above the voiceless people like a dark for-est—a mere worker can never make his way through thisforest, can never obtain justice. 
 Not a single complaintagainst bribery, robbery or abuse of power on the part of theofficials is ever brought to light; every complaint is smotheredin official red tape. 
 The voice of the individual never reaches the whole people, but is lost in this dark jungle, stifled in the police torture chamber. 
 An army of officials,who were never elected by the people and who are not re-sponsible to the people, has woven a thick web, and menand women are struggling in this web like flies. 
 Tsarist autocracy is an autocracy of officials. 
 Tsarist autocracy means the feudal dependence of the people upon the officials and especially upon the police. 
 Tsarist autoc-racy is police autocracy. 
 That is why the workers come out into the streets with banners bearing the inscriptions: “Down with the autoc-racy!”, “Long live political liberty!” That is why the tens of millions of the rural poor must also support and take up this battle-cry of the urban workers. 
 Like them, un-daunted by persecution, fearless of the enemy’s threats and violence, and undeterred by the first reverses, the agri-cultural labourers and the poor peasants must come forward for a decisive struggle for the freedom of the whole of the Russian people and demand first of all the convocation of the representatives of the people . 
 Let the people themselves all over Russia elect their representatives (deputies). 
 Letthose representatives form a supreme assembly, whichwill introduce elective government in Russia, free the people from feudal dependence upon the officials and the police, and secure for the people the right to meet freely,speak freely, and have a free press! That is what the Social-Democrats want first and fore-most. 
 That is the meaning of their first demand: thedemand for political liberty . 
 We know that political liberty, free elections to the State Duma (parliament), freedom of assembly, freedom ofthe press, will not at once deliver the working people frompoverty and oppression. 
 There is no means of immediatelydelivering the poor of town and country from the burdenof working for the rich. 
 The working people have no one to place their hopes in and no one to rely upon but themselves . 
 Nobody will free the working man from poverty if he does not free himself . 
 And to free themselves the workers of the whole country, the whole of Russia, must unite in oneunion, in one party. 
 But millions of workers cannot uniteif the autocratic police government bans all meetings, all workers’ newspapers, and the election of workers’ dep-uties. 
 To unite they must have the right to form unionsof every kind, must have freedom to unite; they must enjoypolitical liberty. 
 Political liberty will not at once deliver the working people from poverty, but it will give the workers a weapon with which to fight poverty . 
 There is no other means and there can be no other means of fighting poverty exceptthe unity of the workers themselves . 
 But millions of people cannot unite unless there is political liberty . 
 In all European countries where the people have won political liberty, the workers began to unite long ago. 
 Throughout the whole of Europe, workers who own no land and no workshops, and work for other people for wages alltheir lives are called proletarians . 
 Over fifty years ago the call was sounded for the working people to unite. 
 “Work-ers of all countries, unite!”— during the past fifty years these words have circled the whole globe, are repeated at tens and hundreds of thousands of workers’ meetings,and can be read in millions of Social-Democratic pamphletsand newspapers in every language. 
 Of course, to unite millions of workers in one union, in one party, is an extremely difficult task; it requires time, persistence, perseverance, and courage. 
 The workers are ground down by poverty and want, benumbed by cease-less toil for the capitalists and landlords; often they havenot even the time to think of why they remain perpetualpaupers, or how to be delivered from this. 
 Everything isdone to prevent the workers from uniting: either by means of direct and brutal violence, as in countries like Russia where there is no political liberty, or by refusing toemploy workers who preach the doctrines of socialism, or,lastly, by means of deceit and bribery. 
 But no violenceor persecution can stop the proletarian workers from fight-ing for the great cause of the emancipation of all working people from poverty and oppression. 
 The number of Social-Democratic workers is constantly growing. 
 Take ourneighbouring country, Germany; there they have electivegovernment. 
 Formerly, in Germany, too, there was anunlimited, autocratic, monarchist government. 
 But long ago,over fifty years ago, the German people destroyed the autoc-racy and won political liberty by force. 
 In Germany laws are not made by a handful of officials, as in Russia, butby an assembly of people ’s representatives , by a parliament, by the Reichstag , as the Germans call it. 
 All adult males take part in electing deputies to this assembly. 
 This makesit possible to count how many votes were cast for the So-cial-Democrats. 
 In 1887 one-tenth of all votes were cast for the Social-Democrats. 
 In 1898 (when the most recent elec-tions to the Reichstag took place) the Social-Democratic voteincreased nearly threefold. 
 This time more than one-fourth of all the votes were cast for the Social-Democrats. 
 Over two million adult males voted for Social-Democratic can-didates to parliament. 
 Among the farm labourers of Ger-many socialism is not yet widespread but it is now makingvery rapid progress among them. 
 And when the masses of farm-hands, day labourers and poor, pauperised peasants unite with their brothers in the towns, the German workers will win and establish an order under which the working people will suffer neither poverty nor oppression. 
 By what means do the Social-Democratic workers want to deliver the people from poverty? To know this, one must clearly understand the cause of the poverty of the vast masses of the people under the present social order. 
 Rich cities are growing, magnificent shops and houses are being built, railways are being con-structed, all kinds of machines and improvements are beingintroduced in industry and agriculture, but millions ofpeople remain in poverty, and continue to work all their livesto provide a bare subsistence for their families. 
 That is not all: more and more people are becoming unemployed. 
 Both in town and country there are more and more peoplewho can find no work at all. 
 In the villages they starve,while in the towns they swell the ranks of the “tramps”and “down-and-outs”, find refuge like beasts in dug-outson the outskirts of towns, or in dreadful slums and cellars, such as those in the Khitrov Market in Moscow. 
 Why is this? Wealth and luxury are increasing, and yet the millions and millions who by their labour create allthis wealth remain in poverty and want! Peasants are dyingof starvation, workers wander about without employment,and yet merchants export millions of poods of grain from Russia to foreign countries, factories are standing idle because the goods cannot be sold, for there is no marketfor them! The cause of all this is, first of all, that most of the land, and also the factories, workshops, machines, buildings,ships, etc. 
, belong to a small number of rich people. 
 Tens of millions of people work on this land and at these fac-tories and workshops, but they are all owned by a fewthousand or tens of thousands of rich people, landlords,merchants, and factory owners. 
 The people work for thoserich men for hire, for wages, for a crust of bread. 
 All thatis produced over and above what is required to provide a bare subsistence for the workers goes to the rich; this is their profit, their “income”. 
 All the benefits arising fromthe use of machines and from improvements in methods of production go to the landowners and capitalists: they accumulate wealth untold, while the workers get only a mis-erable pittance. 
 The workers are brought together for work; on large estates and at big factories several hundred andsometimes even several thousand workers are employed. 
When labour is united in this way, and when the mostdiverse kinds of machines are employed, work becomes moreproductive: one worker produces much more than scores of workers did working separately and without the aid of machines. 
 But the benefits of this more productive labourgo not to all the working people, but to an insignificantnumber of big landowners, merchants, and factory owners. 
 One often hears it said that the landlords and merchants “provide work” for the people, that they “provide” the poor with earnings. 
 It is said, for instance, that a neighbouring factory or a neighbouring landlord “ maintains ” the local peasants. 
 Actually, however, the workers by theirlabour maintain themselves and also all those who do not work themselves. 
 But for permission to work on the landlord’s land, at a factory, or on a railway, the worker gives the owner gratis all he produces, while the worker himself gets only enough for a bare subsistence. 
 Actually,therefore, it is not the landlords and the merchants whogive the workers employment, but the workers who bytheir labour maintain everybody, surrendering gratis the greater part of their labour. 
 Further. 
 In all present-day states the people’s pover-ty is due to the fact that the workers produce all sorts ofarticles for sale, for the market. 
 The factory owner andthe artisan, the landlord and the well-to-do peasant producevarious goods, raise cattle, sow and harvest grain for sale , in order to obtain money . 
 Money has everywhere become the ruling power. 
 All the goods produced by human labour are exchanged for money. 
 With money you can buy anything. 
With money you can even buy a man, that is to say, forcea man who owns nothing to work for another who has mon-ey. 
 Formerly, land used to be the ruling power—that wasthe case under the serf-owning system: whoever possessed land possessed power and authority. 
 Today, however, mon-ey, capital, has become the ruling power. 
 With money youcan buy as much land as you like. 
 Without money you will not be able to do much even if you have land: you must have money to buy a plough or other implements, to buy live-stock, to buy clothes and other town-made goods, not to speak of paying taxes. 
 For the sake of money nearly allthe landlords have mortgaged their estates to the banks. 
 Toget money the government borrows from rich people andbankers all over the world, and pays hundreds of millionsof rubles yearly in interest on these loans. 
 For the sake of money everyone today is waging a fierce war against everyone else. 
 Each tries to buy cheap and tosell dear, each tries to get ahead of the other, to sellas many goods as possible, to undercut the other, to con-ceal from him a profitable market or a profitable contract. 
In this general scramble for money the little man, the petty artisan or the small peasant, fares worse than all: he is always left behind by the rich merchant or the richpeasant. 
 The little man never has any reserves; he livesfrom hand to mouth; each difficulty or accident compelshim to pawn his last belongings or to sell his livestockat a trifling price. 
 Once he has fallen into the clutches of a kulak or of a usurer he very rarely succeeds in escaping from the net, and in most cases he is utterly ruined. 
 Everyyear tens and hundreds of thousands of small peasants andartisans lock up their cottages, surrender their holdingsto the commune gratis and become wage-workers, farm-hands, unskilled workers, proletarians. 
 But the rich grow richer and richer in this struggle for money. 
 They pile up millions and hundreds of millions of rubles in the banksand make profit not only with their own money, butalso with the money deposited in the banks by others. 
The little man who deposits a few score or a few hundredrubles in a bank or a savings-bank receives interest at the rate of three or four kopeks to the ruble; but the rich make millions out of these scores and use these millions toincrease their turnover and make ten and twenty kopeksto the ruble. 
 That is why the Social-Democratic workers say that the only way to put an end to the poverty of the people is to change the existing order from top to bottom, throughout the country, and to establish a socialist order, in otherwords, to take the estates from the big landowners, the factories from the factory owners, and money capital from the bankers, to abolish their private property and turn it over to the whole working people throughout the country. 
 When that is done the workers’ labour will be made use ofnot by rich people living on the labour of others, but bythe workers themselves and by those elected by them. 
 Thefruits of common labour and the advantages from all improve-ments and machinery will then benefit all the working people, all the workers. 
 Wealth will then grow at a still faster rate because the workers will work better for them-selves than they did for the capitalists; the working daywill be shorter; the workers’ standard of living will behigher; all their conditions of life will be completely changed. 
 But it is not an easy matter to change the existing order throughout the country. 
 That requires a great deal of effort, a long and stubborn struggle. 
 All the rich, all the prop-erty-owners, all the bourgeoisie * will defend their riches with all their might. 
 The officials and the army will riseto defend all the rich class , because the government itself is in the hands of the rich class. 
 The workers must rally as one man for the struggle against all those who live on the labour of others; the workers themselves mustunite and help to unite all the poor in a single working class , in a single proletarian class . 
 The struggle will not be easy for the working class, but it will certainly end inthe workers’ victory because the bourgeoisie, or those who live on the labour of others, are an insignificant minor-ity of the population, while the working class is the vastmajority. 
 The workers against the property-owners meansmillions against thousands. 
 The workers in Russia are already beginning to unite for this great struggle in a single workers’ Social-Demo-cratic Party. 
 Difficult as it is to unite in secret, hiding from the police, nevertheless, the organisation is growingand gaining strength. 
 When the Russian people have won *Bourgeois means a property-owner. 
 The bourgeoisie are all the property-owners taken together. 
 A big bourgeois is the owner of big property. 
 A petty bourgeois is the owner of small property. 
 The wordsbourgeoisie and proletariat mean the same as property-owners andworkers, the rich and the poor, or those who live on the labour ofothers and those who work for others for wages. 
 political liberty, the work of uniting the working class, the cause of socialism, will advance much more rapidly, more rapidly than it is advancing among the German workers. 
 3. 
 RICHES AND POVERTY, PROPERTY-OWNERS AND WORKERS IN THE COUNTRYSIDE We know now what the Social-Democrats want. 
 They wan to fight the whole of the rich class to free the people from poverty. 
 In our countryside there is no less and, perhaps,even more poverty than there is in the towns. 
 We shall notspeak here about how great the poverty in the countrysideis. 
 Every worker who has been in the country and everypeasant are well acquainted with want, hunger, and ruin in the countryside. 
 But the peasant does not know the cause of his distress, hunger and destitution, or how to rid himself of this want. 
 To know this one must first find out what causes all want andpoverty in both town and countryside. 
 We have alreadydealt with this briefly, and we have seen that the poor peas-ants and rural workers must unite with the urban workers. 
 But that is not enough. 
 We must also find out what sortof people in the countryside will follow the rich, the prop-erty-owners, and what sort of people will follow the work-ers, the Social-Democrats. 
 We must find out whether thereare many peasants who, no less than the landlords, are able to acquire capital and live on the labour of others. 
 Un-less we get to the bottom of this matter, no amount of talk-ing about poverty will be of any use, and the rural poorwill not know who in the countryside must unite among themselves and with the urban workers, or what must be done to make it a dependable union and to prevent the peasant from being hoodwinked by his own kind, the rich peasant, as well as by the landlord. 
 To get to the bottom of this let us now see how strong the landlords are and how strong the rich peasants are inthe countryside. 
 Let us begin with the landlords. 
 We can judge of their strength in the first place by the amount of land they own as private property. 
 The total amount of land in EuropeanRussia, including peasant allotment land and privately owned land, has been calculated at about 240,000,000 des-siatines * (except the state lands, of which we shall speak separately). 
 Out of this total of 240,000,000 dessiatines, 131,000,000 dessiatines of allotment land are held by thepeasants, that is to say, by over ten million households ; whereas 109,000,000 dessiatines are held by private owners,i. 
e. 
, by less than half a million families . 
 Thus, even if we take the average, every peasant family holds 13 dessia-tines, while every family of private owners owns 218 dessia-tines! But the distribution of the land is much more un-equal, as we shall presently see. 
 Of the 109,000,000 dessiatines owned by private owners seven million are royal demesnes , in other words, the pri-vate property of the members of the imperial family. 
 The tsar, with his family, is the first landlord, the biggest land-owner in Russia. 
 One family possesses more land than half a million peasant families! Further, the churches and monasteries own about six million dessiatines of land. 
 Our priests preach frugality and abstinence to the peasants,but they themselves have, by fair means and foul, accumu-lated an enormous amount of land. 
 Further, about two million dessiatines are owned by the cities and towns, and an equal amount by various com-mercial and industrial companies and corporations. 
 Nine-ty-two million dessiatines (the exact figure is 91,605,845,but to simplify matters we will quote round figures) be-long to less than half a million (481,358) families of pri-vate owners. 
 Half these families are quite small owners,owning less than ten dessiatines of land each, and all ofthem together own less than one million dessiatines. 
 Onthe other hand, sixteen thousand families own over one thousand dessiatines each; and the total land owned by them amounts to sixty-five million dessiatines . 
 What vast areas of land are concentrated in the hands of the big land-owners is also to be seen in the fact that just under one ----*These and all subsequent figures concerning the amount of land are very much out of date. 
 They refer to the years 1877-78. 
 But wehave no more up-to-date figures. 
 The Russian Government can onlysurvive by keeping things in the dark, and that is why complete and truthful information about the life of the people throughout our country is so rarely collected. 
 (A dessiatine =2. 
7 acres. 
— Ed. 
) Calculations of land distribution according to class groups compiled by Lenin in the prepartion of the pamphlet, To the Rural Poor . 
 1903 Reduced thousand families (924) own more than ten thousand des-siatines each, and all together they own twenty-seven mil-lion dessiatines ! One thousand families own as much land as is owned by two million peasant families. 
 Obviously, millions and tens of millions of people are bound to live in poverty and starvation and will go on liv-ing in poverty and starvation as long as such vast areasof land are owned by a few thousand of the rich. 
 Obviously, the state authorities, the government itself (even the tsar’s government) will always dance to the tune of these big land-owners. 
 Obviously, the rural poor can expect no help fromanyone, or from any quarter, until they unite, combinein a single class to wage a stubborn, desperate struggleagainst the landlord class. 
 At this point we must observe that very many people in this country (including even many people of education)have a totally wrong idea about the strength of the landlordclass; they say that the “state” owns much more land. 
 Thesebad counsellors of the peasant say: “A large portion ofthe territory [i. 
e. 
, of all the land] of Russia already be-longs to the state. 
” (These words are taken from the news-paper Revolutsionnaya Rossiya , No. 
 8, p. 
 8. 
) The mistake these people make arises from the following. 
 They haveheard that the state owns 150,000,000 dessiatines of landin European Russia. 
 That is true. 
 But they forget thatthese 150,000,000 dessiatines consist almost entirely of uncultivable land and forests in the Far North , in the Arch-angel, Vologda, Olonets, Vyatka, and Perm gubernias. 
Thus, the state has retained only that land which up tothe present has been quite unfit for cultivation. 
 The cul-tivable land owned by the state amounts to less than four million dessiatines . 
 And these cultivable state lands (for example, in Samara Gubernia, where they are particularly extensive), are leased for very low rents, for next to noth-ing, to the rich. 
 The rich lease thousands and tens of thous-ands of dessiatines of these lands and then sublet themto the peasants at exorbitant rents. 
 The people who say that the state owns a great deal of land are very bad counsellors of the peasant. 
 The actual case is that the big private landowners (including the tsarpersonally) own a lot of good land, and the state itself is in the hands of these big landowners. 
 As long as the rural poor fail to unite, and by uniting become a formidable force, the “state” will always remain the obedient servant of the landlord class. 
 There is another thing that must notbe forgotten: formerly almost all the landlords were nobles. 
The nobility still owns a vast amount of land (in 1877-78,115,000 nobles owned 73,000,000 dessiatines). 
 But todaymoney, capital, has become the ruling power. 
 Merchants and well-to-do peasants have bought very large amounts of land. 
 It is estimated that in the course of thirty years(from 1863 to 1892) the nobility lost (i. 
e. 
, sold more thanthey bought) land to the value of over six hundred millionrubles. 
 And merchants and honorary citizens have acquiredland to the value of 250,000,000 rubles. 
 Peasants, Cossacks, and “other rural inhabitants” (as our government calls the common folk, to distinguish them from the “gentry”, the“clean public”) have acquired land to the value of 300,000,000rubles. 
 Thus, on the average, every year, the peasants inthe whole of Russia acquire land as private property to thevalue of 10,000,000 rubles. 
 And so, there are different sorts of peasants: some live in poverty and starvation; others grow rich. 
 Consequent-ly, the number of rich peasants who incline towards thelandlords and will take the side of the rich against theworkers is increasing. 
 The rural poor who want to unitewith the urban workers must carefully ponder over this and find out whether there are many rich peasants of this kind, how strong they are, and what kind of a union we need tofight this force. 
 We have just mentioned the bad counsel-lors of the peasant. 
 Those bad counsellors are fond of say-ing that the peasants already have such a union. 
 Thatunion is the mir, the village commune. 
 The mir, they say, is a great force. 
 The mir unites the peasants very closely; the organisation (i. 
e. 
, the association, unity) of the peasantsin the mir is colossal (i. 
e. 
, enormous, boundless). 
 That is wrong. 
 It is a tale. 
 A tale invented by kind-hearted people, but a tale nevertheless. 
 If we listen totales we shall only wreck our cause, the cause of uniting the rural poor with the urban workers. 
 Let every rural inhab-itant look round carefully: is the unity of the mir, is the peasant commune, at all like a union of the poor to fight all the rich, all those who live on the labour of others? No, it is not, and it cannot be. 
 In every village, in every commune, there are many farm labourers, many impoverished peasants, and there are rich peasants who employ farm labourers andbuy land “in perpetuity”. 
 These rich peasants are also mem-bers of the commune, and it is they who lord it in the com-mune because they are a force. 
 But do we need a union to whichthe rich belong, and which is lorded over by the rich? Of course not. 
 We need a union to fight the rich. 
 And so, the unity of the mir is no good to us at all. 
 What we need is a voluntary union, a union only of people who have realised that they must unite with the urban work-ers. 
 The village commune, however, is not a voluntary union;it is enforced by the state. 
 The village commune does not consist of people who work for the rich and who want to unite to fight the rich. 
 The village commune consists of all sortsof people, not because they want to be in it, but becausetheir parents lived on the same land and worked for the samelandlord, because the authorities have registered them asmembers of that commune. 
 The poor peasant are not free to leave the commune; they are not free to accept in the commune a man whom the police have registered in another volost,but whom we may need for our union in a particular village. 
No, we need a very different kind of union, a voluntaryunion consisting only of labourers and poor peasants to fightall those who live on the labour of others. 
 The times when the mir was a force have long passed, never to return. 
 The mir was a force when hardly any of the peasants were farm labourers, or workers wandering overthe length and breadth of Russia in search of a job, whenthere were hardly any rich peasants, when all were equallyground down by the feudal landlords. 
 But now money has become the principal power. 
 Members of the same commune will now fight one another for money like wild beasts. 
 Themoneyed peasants sometimes oppress and fleece their fel-low peasants more than the landlords do. 
 What we needtoday is not the unity of the mir, but a union against the power of money , against the rule of capital, a union of all the rural labourers and of all the poor peasants of different communes, a union of all the rural poor with the urbanworkers to fight both the landlords and the rich peasants. 
 We have seen how strong the landlords are. 
 We must now see whether there are many rich peasants and how strong they are. 
 We estimate the strength of the landlords by the size of their estates, by the amount of land they own. 
 The land-lords are free to dispose of their land, free to buy land andto sell it. 
 That is why it is possible to judge their strengthvery accurately by the amount of land they own. 
 The peas-ants, however, still lack the right freely to dispose of their land; they are still semi-serfs, tied to their village commune. 
Hence, the strength of the rich peasants cannot be judgedby the amount of allotment land they hold. 
 The rich peasantsdo not grow rich on their allotments; they buy a considerable amount of land, buying both “in perpetuity” (i. 
e. 
, as their private property) and “for a number of years” (i. 
e. 
, on lease); they buy both from the landlords and from their fellowpeasants, from those peasants who leave the land, or arecompelled by want to let their holdings. 
 It will therefore bemore correct to divide the rich, middle, and poor peasantsaccording to the number of horses they own. 
 A peasant who owns many horses will nearly always be a rich peasant; if he keeps many draught animals it shows that he cultivatesa lot of land, owns land besides his communal allotment,and has money saved up. 
 Moreover, we are in a position tocalculate the number of peasants owning many horses inthe whole of Russia (European Russia, exclusive of Siberia and the Caucasus). 
 Of course, it must not be forgotten that we can speak of the whole of Russia only in averages: thedifferent uyezds and gubernias vary to a considerable degree. 
For instance, in the neighbourhood of cities we often findrich peasant farmers who keep very few horses. 
 Some of themengage in market-gardening—a profitable business; oth-ers keep few horses but many cows and sell milk. 
 In all parts of Russia there are also peasants who do not make mon-ey out of the land, but engage in trade: they run creameries,hulling-mills, and other enterprises. 
 Everybody who livesin the country very well knows of rich peasants in his ownvillage or district. 
 But we want to know how many there are in the whole of Russia and how strong they are, so that the poor peasant shall not have to guess and go about blind-fold, as it were, but know exactly his friends and his foes. 
 Well then, let us see whether there are many peasants who are rich or poor in horses. 
 We have already said that the total number of peasant households in Russia is estimated at about ten million . 
 Between them they now own, probably, about fifteen million horses (about fourteen years ago the number was seventeen million, but it is smaller now). 
Thus, on the average, every ten households have fifteen horses. 
 But the whole point is that some of them—a few— own many horses, while others—very many—own no horses, or very few. 
 There are at least three million peasants, who own no horses, and about three and a half million own one horse each . 
 All these are either utterly ruined or very poor peasants. 
 We call these the rural poor. 
 They number six and a half million out of a total of ten million, that is to say, almost two-thirds ! Next come the middle peasants who own a pair of draught animals each. 
 These peasants numberabout two million households, owning about four million horses. 
 Then come the rich peasants each of whom owns morethan one pair of draught animals. 
 Such comprise one and a half million households, but they own seven and a half million horses. 
 * Thus, about one-sixth of the total house-holds own half the total number of horses. 
 Now that we know this we are in a position to judge fair-ly accurately the strength of the rich peasants. 
 In numberthey are very few: in the different communes and voloststhey will comprise ten to twenty households in every hun-dred. 
 But these few households are the richest. 
 Taking *We repeat that the figures quoted are average, approximate figures. 
 The number of rich peasants may not be exactly a million and a half, but a million and a quarter, or a million and three-quarters, or even two million. 
 That is not a big difference. 
 The important thinghere is not to count them up to the last thousand or last hundredthousand, but clearly to realise the strength and the position of therich peasants so that we may be able to recognise our enemies and ourfriends, that we shall not allow ourselves to be deceived by tales or empty talk, but get to know accurately the position of the poor and especially the position of the rich. 
 Let every rural worker carefully study his own volost and the neighbouring volosts. 
 He will see that we have counted correctly,and that on the average, this will be the position everywhere: outof every hundred households there will be ten at the most twenty, rich families some twenty middle peasants, and all the rest are poor. 
 Russia as a whole, they own almost as many horses as all the other peasants taken together. 
 That means that their land under crops must also amount to nearly half the total area sown to crops by the peasants. 
 Such peasants harvest muchmore grain than they require for their families. 
 They selllarge quantities of grain. 
 They grow grain not merely to feedthemselves, but grow it chiefly for sale, to make money. 
Peasants like these can save money. 
 They deposit it in sav-ings-banks and banks. 
 They buy land as property. 
 We have already said how much land the peasants all over Russia buyevery year; nearly all this land goes to these few rich peas-ants. 
 The rural poor have to think not of buying land, but ofgetting enough to eat. 
 Often they have not enough money tobuy grain, let alone land. 
 Therefore, the banks in general and the Peasants’ Bank in particular do not help all peasants to buy land (as is sometimes asserted by people who try todeceive the muzhik or by the very simple-minded), but onlyan insignificant number of peasants, only the rich peasants. 
Therefore, the peasant’s evil counsellors whom we havementioned tell an untruth when they say that the land is being bought by the peasants, that it is passing from capital to labour. 
 The land can never pass to labour, that is, to thepoor working man, because land has to be paid for with mon-ey. 
 But the poor never have any money to spare. 
 The landcan go only to the rich, moneyed peasants, to capital, to thosepeople against whom the rural poor must fight in alliance with the urban workers. 
 The rich peasants not only buy land in perpetuity; most often they take land for a number of years, on lease. 
 Byrenting large plots they prevent the rural poor from gettingland. 
 For example, it has been calculated how much landrich peasants have rented in a single uyezd (Konstanti-nograd) in Poltava Gubernia. 
 And what do we find? The number who rented thirty dessiatines or more per house-hold is very small, only two out of every fifteen households. 
But these rich peasants have gained possession of one half of all the rented land, and each of them has on the averageseventy-five dessiatines of the rented land! Or take Taurida Gubernia, where a calculation has been made of how much of the land rented by the peasants from the state throughthe mir, through the village commune, has been grabbed by the rich. 
 It has been found that the rich, who account for only one-fifth of the total number of households, have grabbed three-fourths of the rented land. 
 Everywhere land goes to those who have money, and only the few rich havemoney. 
 Further, much land is now let by the peasants themselves. 
 The peasants abandon their holdings because they have nolivestock, no seed, nothing with which to run their farms. 
 Today even land is of no use unless you have money. 
 For instance, in Novouzensk Uyezd in Samara Gubernia, one,sometimes even two, out of every three rich peasant house-holds rent allotment land in their own or in another commune. 
 The allotments are let by those who have no horses, or onlyone horse. 
 In Taurida Gubernia as much as one-third o f all peasant households let their allotments. 
 One-fourth of the peasant allotments, a quarter of a million dessiatines,are let. 
 Of this quarter of a million dessiatines, one hundredand fifty thousand dessiatines (three-fifths) are rented byrich peasants! This, too, shows whether the unity of the mir, the commune, is of any use to the poor. 
 In the village com-mune, he who has money has power. 
 What we need is the unity of the poor of all communes. 
 Just as with land purchase, the peasants are deceived by talk about buying cheap ploughs, harvesters, and all sortsof improved implements. 
 Zemstvo stores and artels are setup and it is said: improved implements will better the con-ditions of the peasantry. 
 That is mere deception. 
 All these improved implements always go to the rich; the poor getnext to nothing. 
 They cannot think of buying ploughs andharvesters; they have enough to do to keep body and soultogether! All this sort of “helping the peasants” is nothingbut helping the rich. 
 As for the mass of the poor, who have neither land, livestock, nor reserves, they will not benefit by the fact that the better implements will be cheaper. 
 Hereis an example. 
 In an uyezd in Samara Gubernia all theimproved implements belonging to the poor and to the richpeasants have been taken stock of. 
 It was found thatone-fifth of all households, i. 
e. 
, the most well-to-do, owned almost three-fourths of the improved implements, while the poor— half the households—had only one-thirtieth . 
 Out of a total of 28,000 households, 10,000 possessed one horse each, or none; these 10,000 had only seven improved imple-ments out of a total of 5,724 improved implements owned by all the peasant households in the uyezd. 
 Seven out of 5,724—that is the share of the rural poor in all thesefarm improvements, in all this increase in the number ofploughs and harvesters which are supposed to help “all thepeasantry”! That is what the rural poor must expect fromthose who talk about “improving peasant farming”! Finally, one of the main features of the rich peasants is that they hire farm-hands and day labourers . 
 Like the land-lords, the rich peasants also live on the labour of others. 
Like the landlords, they grow rich because the mass of thepeasants are ruined and pauperised. 
 Like the landlords,they try to squeeze as much work as they can out of their farm-hands and to pay them as little as possible. 
 If millions of peasants were not utterly ruined and compelled to go towork for others, become hired labourers, sell their labour-power—the rich peasants could not exist, could not carryon their farms. 
 There would be no “abandoned” allotmentsfor them to pick up and no labourers for them to hire. 
 The million and a half rich peasants throughout Russia certainly hire no less than a million farm-hands and day labourers. 
 Obviously, in the great struggle between the propertied classand the class of the propertyless, between masters andworkers, between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, therich peasants will take the side of the property-owners against the working class. 
 We now know the position and the strength of the rich peasantry. 
 Let us examine the conditions of the rural poor. 
 We have already said that the rural poor comprise the vast majority, almost two-thirds, of the peasant householdsthroughout Russia. 
 To begin with, the number of households without horses cannot be less than three million —probably more than that today, perhaps three and a half million. 
Every famine year, every crop failure, ruins tens of thou-sands of farms. 
 The population grows, life on the land be-comes more crowded, but all the best land has been grabbedby the landlords and the rich peasants. 
 And so, every year more and more people are ruined, go to the towns and the factories, take work as farm-hands, or become unskilledlabourers. 
 A peasant who has no horse is one who has become quite poor. 
 He is a proletarian. 
 He gains a living (if you can call it living; it would be truer to say that he just contrives to keep body and soul together) not from the land, not from his farm, but by working for hire . 
 He is brother to the town worker. 
 Even land is of no use to the peasant without ahorse: half the households without horses let their allotments , while some even surrender them to the commune for nothing(and sometimes even pay the difference between the taxes and the expected income from the land!) because they are not in a position to till their land. 
 A peasant who has no horsesows one dessiatine, or two at the most. 
 He always has tobuy additional grain (if he has the money to buy it with)—his own crop will never suffice to feed him. 
 Peasants whoown one horse each, and there are about three and a half million such households throughout Russia, are not very much better off. 
 Of course, there are exceptions, and wehave already said that, here and there, there are peasantswith one horse each who are doing middling well, or are evenrich. 
 But we are not speaking of exceptions, of individuallocalities, but of Russia as a whole. 
 If we take the entire mass of peasants who have one horse each, there can be no doubt that they are a mass of paupers. 
 Even in the agricultur-al gubernias the peasant who has one horse sows only threeor four dessiatines, rarely five; his crop does not suffice either. 
Even in a good year his food is no better than that of apeasant without a horse—which means that he is always underfed, always starves. 
 His farm is in decay, his livestock is poor and short of fodder, and he is not in a position tolook after his land properly. 
 The peasant who owns onehorse—in Voronezh Gubernia, for instance—can afford tospend (not counting expenditure on fodder) not more thantwenty rubles a year on the whole of his farm! (A rich peasant spends ten times as much . 
) Twenty rubles a year for rent, to buy livestock, repair his wooden plough and other imple-ments, pay the shepherd, and for everything else! Do you callthat farming? It is sheer misery, hard labour, endless drudg-ery. 
 It is natural that some of the peasants with one horseeach, and not a few, should also let their allotments . 
 Even land is of little use to a pauper. 
 He has no money and his land does not even provide him with enough to eat, let alonewith money. 
 But money is needed for everything: for food, for clothing, for the farm, and to pay taxes. 
 In Voronezh Gubernia, a peasant who owns one horse usually has to pay about eighteen rubles a year in taxes alone, while he cannot make more than seventy-five rubles a year to meet all his expenses. 
 Under these circumstances it is sheer mockery totalk about buying land, about improved implements, aboutagricultural banks: those things were not invented for thepoor. 
 Where is the peasant to get the money from? He has to look for “earnings” on the side. 
 A peasant who owns onehorse, like the peasant who owns none, ekes out a livingonly with the help of “earnings”. 
 But what does “earnings”mean? It means working for others, working for hire. 
 Itmeans that the peasant who owns one horse has half ceased to be an independent farmer and has become a hireling, a proletarian. 
 That is why such peasants are called semi-proletarians . 
 They, too, are brothers to the town workers because they, too, are fleeced in every way by all sorts ofemployers. 
 They, too, have no way out, no salvation, exceptby uniting with the Social-Democrats to fight all the rich, all the property-owners. 
 Who works on the building of railways? Who is fleeced by the contractors? Who goes outlumbering and timber-floating? Who works as farm-hand?Or as day labourer? Who does the unskilled work in thetowns and ports? It is always the rural poor, the peasantswho have no horses or only one each. 
 It is always the rural proletarians and semi-proletarians. 
 And what vast numbers of these there are in Russia! It has been calculated thatthroughout Russia (exclusive of the Caucasus and Siberia)eight and sometimes even nine million passports are taken out yearly. 
 Those are all for migratory workers. 
 They arepeasants only in name; actually, they are hirelings, wage-labourers. 
 They must all unite in one union with the town workers—and every ray of light and knowledge that reachesthe countryside will strengthen and consolidate thisunity. 
 There is one more point about “earnings” that must not be forgotten. 
 All kinds of officials and people who think as the officials do are fond of saying that the peasant, the muzhik, “needs” two things: land (but not very much of it—besides, he cannot get much, because the rich have grabbed it all!) and “earnings”. 
 Therefore, they say, in order to help the people, it is necessary to introduce more trades in the rural districts, to “provide” more “earnings”. 
 Such talk is sheer hypocrisy. 
 For the poor, “earnings” meanwage-labour. 
 To “provide earnings” for the peasant meanstransforming him into a wage-labourer. 
 Fine sort of assis-tance this! For the rich peasants there are other kinds of“earnings”, which require capital, for instance, the build-ing of a flour-mill or some other plant, the purchase of threshing-machines, trade, and so on. 
 To confuse the earn-ings of moneyed people with the wage-labour of the poor means deceiving the poor. 
 Of course, this deception is tothe advantage of the rich; it is to their advantage to makeit appear that all kinds of “earnings” are open to and within the reach of all the peasants. 
 But he who really cares for the welfare of the poor will tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth . 
 It remains for us to consider the middle peasants. 
 We have already seen that, on the average, taking Russia asa whole, we must regard as a middle peasant one who has a pair of draught animals, and that out of a total of ten million households there are about two million middle peas-ant households in the country. 
 The middle peasant standsbetween the rich peasant and the proletarian, and that iswhy he is called a middle peasant. 
 His standard of living,too, is middling: in a good year he makes ends meet on his farm, but poverty is always knocking at the door. 
 He has either very few savings or none at all. 
 That is why hisfarm is in a precarious position. 
 He finds it hard to getmoney: only very seldom can he make as much moneyout of his farm as he needs, and if he does, it is just barelyenough. 
 To go out for earnings would mean neglecting the farm and everything would go to rack and ruin. 
 Never-theless, many of the middle peasants cannot get along with-out earnings: they, too, have to hire themselves to others;want compels them to go into bondage to the landlord, tofall into debt. 
 And once in debt the middle peasant is hardlyever able to get out of it, for unlike the rich peasant he has no steady income. 
 Therefore, once he falls into debt it is as if he had put his neck in a halter. 
 He remains a debtoruntil he is utterly ruined. 
 It is chiefly the middle peasant /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR who falls into bondage to the landlord, because for work paid on a job basis the landlord needs a peasant who is not ruined, one who owns a pair of horses and all implements required in farming. 
 It is not easy for the middle peas-ant to go elsewhere in search of earnings, so he goes intobondage to the landlord in return for grain, permission touse pasture land, the lease of the cut-off lands, and moneyadvances during the winter. 
 The middle peasant is hard pressed, not only by the landlord and the kulak, but also by his rich neighbour, who is always one jump ahead when hewants to acquire more land and never misses an opportunityto squeeze him in some way or other. 
 Such is the life of themiddle peasant; he is neither fish nor fowl. 
 He can be nei-ther a real master nor a worker. 
 All the middle peasants strive to become masters: they want to be property-owners, but very few succeed. 
 There are a few, a very few, who evenhire farm-hands or day labourers, try to become rich on thelabour of others, to rise to wealth on the backs of others. 
But most middle peasants have no money to hire labourers—in fact, they have to hire themselves out. 
 Wherever a struggle begins between the rich and the poor, between the property-owners and the workers, the middlepeasant remains in between, not knowing which side to take. 
The rich call him to their side: you, too, are a master, aman of property, they say to him, you have nothing to dowith the penniless workers. 
 But the workers say: the rich will cheat and fleece you, and there is no other salvation for you but to help us in our fight against all the rich. 
 Thisstruggle for the middle peasant is going on everywhere, inall countries, wherever the Social-Democratic workers arefighting to emancipate the working people. 
 In Russia thestruggle is just beginning. 
 That is why we must most care-fully study the matter and understand clearly the deceits the rich resort to in order to win over the middle peasant;we must learn how to expose these deceits and help the middlepeasant to find his real friends. 
 If the Russian Social-Democratic workers at once take the right road, we shallestablish a firm alliance between the rural workers and the urban workers more quickly than our comrades, the Ger-man workers, and we shall speedily achieve victory over allthe enemies of the working people. 
 4. 
 WHAT PATH SHOULD THE MIDDLE PEASANT TAKE? SHOULD HE TAKE THE SIDE OF THE PROPERTY-OWNERS AND THE RICH OR THE SIDE OF THE WORKERS AND THE POOR? All property-owners, the entire bourgeoisie, try to win over the middle peasant by promising him all sorts ofways to improve his farm (cheap ploughs, agricultural banks, the introduction of grass sowing, cheap livestock and ferti-lisers, and so on) and also by inducing the peasant to joinall sorts of agricultural societies (co-operatives, as they arecalled in books) which unite all kinds of farmers with theobject of improving farming methods. 
 In this way the bour-geoisie try to keep the middle and even the small peasant, even the semi-proletarian, from uniting with the workers, and try to induce them to side with the rich, with the bour-geoisie, in their fight against the workers, the proletariat. 
 To this the Social-Democratic workers reply: improved farming is an excellent thing. 
 There is no harm in buy-ing cheaper ploughs; nowadays even a merchant, if he is not a fool, tries to sell more cheaply to attract custom-ers. 
 But when a poor or a middle peasant is told thatimproved farming and cheaper ploughs will help all of themto escape from poverty and to get on their feet, without touch-ing the rich, this is deception . 
 All these improvements, lower prices, and co-operatives (societies for the sale and pur-chase of goods) benefit the rich far more than anybody else . 
 The rich grow stronger and oppress the poor and middle peasantsmore and more. 
 As long as the rich remain rich, as long asthey own most of the land, livestock, implements, andmoney—as long as all this lasts, not only the poor but eventhe middle peasants will never be able to escape from want. 
 One or two middle peasants may be able to climb into the ranks of the rich with the aid of all these improvements andco-operatives, but the people as a whole, and all the middlepeasants, will sink deeper and deeper into poverty. 
 For all middle peasants to become rich, the rich themselves mustbe turned out, and they can be turned out only if the urban workers and the rural poor are united. 
 The bourgeoisie say to the middle (and even to the small) peasant: we will sell you land at a low price, and ploughs at a low price, but in return you must sell yourselves to us and give up fighting all the rich. 
 The Social-Democratic worker says: if you are really offered goods at a low price, why not buy them, if youhave the money; that is sound business. 
 But you should neversell yourselves. 
 To give up the fight in alliance with theurban workers against the entire bourgeoisie would meanremaining in poverty and want for ever. 
 If goods become cheaper, the rich will gain still more and become richer. 
 But those who never have money to spare will gain nothingfrom cheaper goods until they take that money from thebourgeoisie. 
 Let us take an example. 
 Those who support the bour-geoisie make much ado about all sorts of co-operatives (societies for buying cheap and selling profitably). 
 There are even people who call themselves “Socialist-Revolution-aries”, who, echoing the bourgeoisie, also talk loudly aboutthe peasant needing nothing so much as co-operatives. 
All sorts of co-operatives are beginning to spring up inRussia, too, although there are still very few of them here, and there will not be many until we enjoy political liberty. 
 Take Germany: there the peasants have many co-operativesof all kinds. 
 But see who gains most from these co-opera-tives. 
 In all Germany, 140,000 farmers belong to societiesfor the sale of milk and dairy products, and these 140,000farmers (we again take round figures for the sake of simplic-ity) own 1,100,000 cows. 
 It is calculated that there are four million poor peasants in Germany. 
 Of these, only 40,000 belong to co-operatives: thus, only one out of every hundred poor peasants enjoys the benefits of these co-operatives. 
These 40,000 poor peasants own only 100,000 cows in all. 
Further, the middle farmers, the middle peasants, number one million ; of these, 50,000 belong to co-operatives (that is to say, five out of every hundred) and they own a totalof 200,000 cows. 
 Finally, the rich farmers (i. 
e. 
, both land-lords and rich peasants) number one-third of a million ; of these, 50,000 belong to co-operatives (that is to say, seven-teen out of every hundred!) and they own 800,000 cows! That is whom the co-operatives help first and foremost. 
 That is how the peasant is deceived by those people whotalk loudly about saving the middle peasant by means of such societies for buying cheap and selling profitably. 
 It is, indeed, at a very low price that the bourgeoisie want to “buy off” the peasant from the Social-Democrats, who call upon both the poor and the middle peasant to join them. 
 In our country, too, co-operative cheese dairies and amalgamated dairies are beginning to be formed. 
 In ourcountry, too, there are plenty of people who shout: artels, themir, and co-operatives—that is what the peasant needs. 
 But see who gains by these artels, co-operatives, and renting by the mir. 
 Out of every hundred households in our country, at least twenty own no cows at all; thirty own only one coweach: these sell milk from dire need, their own children haveto go without milk, starve, and die off like flies. 
 The richpeasants, however, own three, four and more cows each, and these rich peasants own half the total number of cows owned by peasants. 
 Who, then, gains from co-operative cheesedairies. 
 Obviously, the landlords and the peasant bourgeoisiegain first of all. 
 Obviously, it is to their advantage that the middle peasants and the poor should follow in theirwake and that they should believe that the means of escap-ing from want is not the struggle of all the workers against the entire bourgeoisie, but the striving of individual smallfarmers to climb out of their present position and getinto the ranks of the rich. 
 This striving is fostered and encouraged in every way by all the champions of the bourgeoisie, who pretend to be the champions and friends of the small peasant. 
 And many simple-minded people fail to see the wolf in sheep’s cloth-ing, and repeat this bourgeois deception in the belief thatthey are helping the poor and middle peasants. 
 Forinstance, they argue in books and in speeches that small-scalefarming is the most profitable, most remunerative form of farming, that small-scale farming is flourishing, and that is why, they say, there are so many small producers in agri-culture everywhere, and why they cling to their land (andnot because all the best lands are owned by the bourgeoisie,and all the money, too, while the poor have to live in drudg-ery all their lives crowded on tiny patches of land!). 
 The small peasant does not need much money, these smooth-tongued people say; the small and the middle peasants aremore thrifty and more industrious than the big farmers, and know how to live a simpler life; instead of buying hay for their cattle, they are content to feed them on straw. 
 Instead of buying an expensive machine, they get up earlier and toil longer and do as much as a machine does; insteadof paying money to strangers for doing repairs, the peasanthimself takes his hatchet on a Sunday and does a bit ofcarpentry—and that is much cheaper than the way a bigfarmer goes about it; instead of feeding an expensive horse or an ox, he uses his cow for ploughing. 
 In Germany all the poor peasants use cows to haul their ploughs, and in ourcountry, too, the people have become so impoverishedthat they are beginning to use not only cows, but men andwomen to pull ploughs! How profitable, how cheap allthis is! How praiseworthy of the middle and small peasants to be so industrious, so diligent, to live such simple lives, and not to waste their time on nonsense, not to think of social-ism, but only of their farms, not to strive towards the work-ers who organise strikes against the bourgeoisie, buttowards the rich and try to join the ranks of respectablefolk! If only all were so industrious and so diligent, and lived frugally, and did not drink, and saved more money, and spent less on calico, and had fewer children—all wouldbe happy and there would be no poverty and no want! Such are the sweet songs the bourgeoisie sings to the middle peasant, and there are simpletons who believe these songsand repeat them! * Actually, all these honeyed words are nothing but deceit and mockery of the peasant. 
 What these smooth-tongued people call cheap and profitable farmingis the want, the dire need, which forces the middle and smallpeasant to work from morning till night, to begrudge himselfa crust of bread, to grudge every penny he spends. 
 Of course,what can be “cheaper” and “more profitable” than to wear *In Russia these simpletons who wish the peasant well, but who every now and then start this sort of honeyed talk, are called “Narod-niks” or the “advocates of small-scale farming”. 
 The “Socialist-Revo-lutionaries”, for lack of understanding, follow in their footsteps. 
 In Germany also there are many smooth-tongued people. 
 One of them, Eduard David, has recently written a big book, in which he says thatsmall farms are infinitely more profitable than large ones, becausethe small peasant does not spend money needlessly, keeps no horsesfor ploughing, and is content to use his cow instead, from whichhe also gets milk. 
 the same pair of trousers for three years, go about barefoot in summer, repair one’s wooden plough with a piece of rope, and feed one’s cow on rotten straw from the roof! Put a bour-geois or a rich peasant on such a “cheap” and “profitable”farm, and he will soon forget all this honeyed talk! The people who extol small-scale farming sometimes want to help the peasant, but actually they only do him harm. 
With their honeyed words they deceive the peasant in the same way as people are deceived by a lottery . 
 I shall tell you what a lottery is. 
 Let us suppose I have a cow, worth50 rubles. 
 I want to sell the cow by means of a lottery,so I offer everyone tickets at a ruble each. 
 Everyone hasa chance of getting the cow for one ruble! People are temptedand the rubles pour in. 
 When I have collected a hundred ru-bles I proceed to draw the lottery: the one whose ticket is drawn gets the cow for a ruble, the others get nothing. 
Was the cow “cheap” for the people? No, it was very dear, be-cause the total money they paid was double the value of thecow, because two persons (the one who ran the lottery and theone who won the cow) gained without doing any work, and gained at the expense of the ninety-nine who lost their money. 
 Thus, those who say that lotteries are advantageousto the people are simply practising deceit on the people. 
Those who promise to deliver the peasants from povertyand want by means of co-operatives of every kind (societiesfor buying cheap and selling profitably), improved farming, banks, and all that sort of thing, are deceiving them in exactly the same way. 
 Just as in a lottery wherethere is one winner and all the rest are losers, so it is withthese things: one middle peasant may manage to get rich,but ninety-nine of his fellow peasants bend their backsall their lives, never escape from want, and even sink more deeply into poverty. 
 Let every villager examine his commune and the whole district a little more closely: arethere many middle peasants who become rich and forgetwant? And how many are there who can never rid themselvesof want? How many are ruined and leave their villages?As we have seen, it has been calculated that in the whole of Russia there are not more than two million middle peasant farms. 
 Suppose there were ten times as many societies ofall kinds for buying cheap and selling profitably as there are now. 
 What would the result be? It would be a big figure if a hundred thousand middle peasants succeeded in raising themselves to the level of the rich. 
 What would that mean? It would mean that out of every hundred middle peasants,five would become rich. 
 But what about the other ninety-five? They would be in the same straits as ever, and manyof them would be in even greater difficulties! And thepoor would only be impoverished all the more! Of course, the bourgeoisie want nothing more than that the largest possible number of middle and small peasantsshould strive to get rich, believe in the possibility of escaping from poverty without fighting the bourgeoisie, place theirhopes in diligence and frugality and in becoming rich, andnot in uniting with the rural and urban workers. 
 The bour-geoisie do all they can to foster this deceptive faith and hope in the peasant, and try to lull him with honeyed words. 
 To expose the deception practised by these smooth-tongued people it is sufficient to ask them three questions. 
 Question one: can the working people rid themselves of want and poverty when, in Russia, a hundred million des-siatines out of two hundred and forty million dessiatines of arable land belong to private landowners? When sixteenthousand very big landowners possess sixty-five million des-siatines? Question two: can the working people rid themselves of want and poverty when one and a half million rich peasant households (out of a total of ten million) have concentrated in their hands half of all peasants’ land under crops, halfthe total number of horses and livestock owned by peasants,and much more than half the total peasant stocks and savings?When this peasant bourgeoisie is growing richer and richer,oppressing the poor and middle peasants, making money out of the labour of others, of the farm-hands and day la-bourers? When six and a half million households consist ofpoor peasants, destitute, always starving, and reduced to win-ning a miserable crust of bread by all kinds of wage-labour? Question three: can the working people rid themselves of want and poverty when money has become the ruling power, when everything can be bought for money—facto-ries and land, and even men and women can be bought toserve as wage-workers, wage-slaves? When no one can live or run a farm without money? When the small farmer, the poor peasant, has to wage a struggle against the big farmer to get money? When a few thousand landlords, merchants, factory owners, and bankers have concentrated in their handshundreds of millions of rubles, and, moreover, control allthe banks, where thousands of millions of rubles aredeposited? No honeyed words about the advantages of small-scale farming or of co-operatives will enable you to evade these questions. 
 To these questions there can be only one answer:the real “co-operation” that can save the working people isthe union of the rural poor with the Social-Democratic work-ers in the towns to fight the entire bourgeoisie. 
 The fasterthis union grows and becomes strong, the sooner will the middle peasant realise that the promises of the bourgeoisie are all lies, and the sooner will the middle peasant comeover to our side. 
 The bourgeoisie know this, and that is why, in addition to honeyed words, they spread all sorts of lies about theSocial-Democrats. 
 They say that the Social-Democrats want to deprive the middle and small peasants of their property. 
 That is a lie . 
 The Social-Democrats want to deprive of their property only the big proprietors, only those who live on the labour of others . 
 The Social-Democrats will never take away the property of the small and middle farmers who do not hirelabourers . 
 The Social-Democrats defend and champion the interests of all the working people, not only the interests of the urban workers, who are more class-conscious and moreunited than the others, but also of the agricultural work-ers, and of those small artisans and peasants who do nothire workers, do not strive towards the rich, and do not goover to the side of the bourgeoisie. 
 The Social-Democrats are fighting for all improvements in the conditions of the workers and peasants which can be introduced immediately, when we have not yet destroyed the rule of the bourgeoisie,and which will help them in the struggle against the bour-geoisie. 
 But the Social-Democrats do not deceive the peasant;they tell him the whole truth , plainly tell him in advance that no improvements will rid the people of want and pover-ty as long as the bourgeoisie is in power. 
 To enable all the people to know what the Social-Democrats are and what they want, the Social-Democrats have drawn up a programme . 
 A programme is a brief, clear, and precise statement of all the things a party is striving and fighting for . 
 The Social-Democratic Party is the only party that advances a clear andprecise programme for all the people to know and see, andfor the party to consist only of people who really want tofight for the emancipation of all the working people from theyoke of the bourgeoisie, and who properly understand who must unite for this fight and how the fight must be con-ducted. 
 Furthermore, the Social-Democrats believe that theymust explain in their programme, in a direct, frank, and precise way, the causes of the poverty and want among the working people , and why the unity of the workers is becoming wider and stronger. 
 It is not enough to say that life is hard and to call for revolt; every tub-thumper can do that, but it is of little use. 
 The working people must clearly under-stand why they are living in such poverty and with whom they must unite in order to fight to liberate themselves from want. 
 We have already stated what the Social-Democrats want; we have explained the causes of the working people’s want and poverty; we have indicated whom the rural poor mustfight and with whom they must unite for this fight. 
 We shall now explain what improvements we can win at once by fighting for them, improvements in the lives of the workers and in the lives of the peasants. 
 5. 
 WHAT IMPROVEMENTS ARE THE SOCIAL-DEMOCRATS STRIVING TO OBTAIN FOR THE WHOLE PEOPLE AND FOR THE WORKERS? The Social-Democrats are fighting for the liberation of all the working people from all robbery, oppression, and in-justice. 
 To become free the working class must first of allbecome united. 
 And to become united it must have freedomto unite, have the right to unite, have political liberty. 
We have already said that autocratic government means enslavement of the people by the officials and the police. 
 Political liberty is therefore needed by the whole people,except a handful of courtiers and a few money-bags and high dignitaries who are received at Court. 
 But most of all, political liberty is needed by the workers and the peasants. 
 The rich can escape the self-will and the tyranny of of-ficials and the police by buying them off. 
 The rich can maketheir complaints heard in the highest places. 
 That is whythe police and the officials take much fewer liberties withthe rich than with the poor. 
 The workers and the peasantshave no money to buy off the police or the officials; they have no one to complain to and are not in a position to sue them in court. 
 The workers and the peasants will never ridthemselves of the extortions, tyranny, and insults of the poli-ce and the officials as long as there is no elective government , as long as there is no national assembly of deputies . 
 Only such a national assembly of deputies can free the people from enslavement by the officials. 
 Every intelligent peasant must support the Social-Democrats, who first and foremostdemand of the tsarist government the convocation of a na-tional assembly of deputies . 
 The deputies must be elected by all, irrespective of social-estate; irrespective of wealth orpoverty. 
 The elections must be free, without any interfer-ence on the part of the officials; they must be carried out under the supervision of such that enjoy the people’s con-fidence, and not of police officers or the rural superintendents. 
Under such conditions, deputies representing the entirepeople will be able to discuss all the needs of the people, andintroduce a better state of affairs in Russia. 
 The Social-Democrats demand that the police be deprived of the power to imprison anyone without trial. 
 Officialsmust be severely punished for arbitrarily arresting anyone. 
To put an end to their self-assumed power, they must be cho-sen by the people, and everyone must have the right to lodgea complaint against any official directly in a court. 
 What is the use of complaining to the rural superintendent about a police officer, or to the governor about the rural super-intendent? The rural superintendent will, of course, alwaysprotect the police officer and the governor will always pro-tect the rural superintendent, while the complainant willget into trouble. 
 He runs a fair chance of being put into pris-on or deported to Siberia. 
 The officials will be curbed only when everyone in Russia (as in all other countries) has theright to complain both to the national assembly and to the elected courts, and to speak freely of his needs, to write about them in the newspapers. 
 The Russian people are still in feudal dependence upon the officials. 
 Without permission from the officials thepeople cannot call meetings, or get books and newspapersprinted. 
 Is that not feudal dependence? If meetings cannotbe freely called, or books freely printed, how can one obtainredress against the officials, or against the rich? Of course, the officials suppress every book, every utterance that tells the truth about the people’s poverty. 
 The present pamphlet,too, has to be printed by the Social-Democratic Party secretlyand circulated secretly: anyone who is found in posses-sion of this pamphlet will make the acquaintance of courtsand prisons. 
 But the Social-Democratic workers are not afraid of this: they print more and more, and give the people more and more truthful books to read. 
 And no pris-ons, no persecution can halt the fight for the people’sfreedom! The Social-Democrats demand that the social-estates be abolished, and that all the citizens of the state enjoy exact-ly the same rights. 
 Today the social-estates are divided into tax-paying and non-tax-paying, into privileged andnon-privileged; we have blue blood and common blood;even the birch has been retained for the common people. 
In no other country are the workers and peasants in sucha position of inferiority. 
 In no country except Russia are there different laws for different social-estates. 
 It is time the Russian people, too, demanded that every muzhik shouldpossess all the rights possessed by the nobility. 
 Is it not a disgrace that the birch should still be used and that a tax-paying social-estate should be in existence more than forty years after the abolition of serfdom? The Social-Democrats demand that the people shall have complete freedom of movement and occupation. 
 What doesfreedom of movement mean? It means that the peasant should be free to go wherever he pleases, to move to whatever placehe wants to, to live in any village or town he chooses with-out having to ask for permission from anyone. 
 It means that passports should be abolished in Russia too (in other coun-tries passports were abolished long ago), that no local policeofficer or rural superintendent should dare to hinder any peasant from settling or working wherever he pleases. 
 The Russian peasant is still so much the serf of the officials that he is not free to move to a town, or to settle in a new district. 
 The minister issues orders that the governors shouldnot allow unauthorised settlement! A governor knows better than the peasant what place is good for the peasant! The peas-ant is a little child and must not move without permissionof the authorities! Is that not feudal dependence? Is it not an insult to the people when any profligate nobleman is allowed to lord it over grown-up farmers? There is a book called Crop Failure and the Distress of the People (famine), written by the present “Minister of Agriculture” Mr. 
 Yermolov. 
 This book says in so many words:the peasant must not change residence as long as their wor-ships the landlords need hands. 
 The minister says this quite openly, without the least embarrassment: he thinks the peas-ant will not hear what he is saying and will not understand. 
Why allow people to go away when the landlords needcheap labour? The more crowded the people are on the landthe more that is to the landlords’ advantage; the poorer the peasants are, the more cheaply can they be hired and the more meekly will they submit to oppression of every kind. 
Formerly, the bailiffs looked after the landlord’s interests,now the rural superintendents and governors do that. 
 Former-ly, the bailiffs ordered the flogging of peasants in the stables;now the rural superintendent in the volost administration office orders the flogging. 
 The Social-Democrats demand that the standing army be abolished and that a militia be established in its stead, thatall the people be armed. 
 A standing army is an army thatis divorced from the people and trained to shoot down thepeople. 
 If the soldier were not locked up for years in barracks and inhumanly drilled there, would he ever agree to shoot down his brothers, the workers and the peasants? Would he goagainst the starving peasants? A standing army is not neededin the least to protect the country from attack by an enemy;a people’s militia is sufficient. 
 If every citizen is armed,Russia need fear no enemy. 
 And the people would be re-lieved of the yoke of the military clique. 
 The upkeep of this clique costs hundreds of millions of rubles a year , and all this money is collected from the people; that is why the taxes are so heavy and why it becomes increasingly difficult to live. 
 The military clique still further increases the power of the officials and police over the people. 
 This clique is need-ed to plunder foreign peoples, for instance, to take theland from the Chinese. 
 This does not ease but, on the con-trary, increases the people’s burden because of greater taxa-tion. 
 The substitution of the armed nation for the standingarmy would enormously ease the burden of all the workers and all the peasants. 
 Similarly, the abolition of indirect taxation , which the Social-Democrats demand, would be an enormous relief. 
Indirect taxes are such taxes that are not imposed directlyon land or on a house but are paid by the people indirectly , in the form of higher prices for what they buy. 
 The state im-poses taxes on sugar, vodka, kerosene, matches, and all sorts of articles of consumption; these taxes are paid to theTreasury by the merchant or by the manufacturer, but, ofcourse, he does not pay it out of his own pocket, but out ofthe money his customers pay him. 
 The price of vodka, sugar,kerosene, and matches goes up, and every purchaser of a bot-tle of vodka or of a pound of sugar has to pay the tax in addi-tion to the price of the goods. 
 For instance, if, say, you payfourteen kopeks for a pound of sugar, four kopeks (approx-imately) constitute the tax: the sugar-manufacturer hasalready paid the tax to the Treasury and is now exactingfrom every customer the sum he has paid. 
 Thus, indirect taxes are taxes on articles of consumption, taxes which are paid by the purchaser in the form of higher prices for the ar-ticles he buys. 
 It is sometimes said that indirect taxationis the fairest form of taxation: you pay according to theamount you buy. 
 But this is not true. 
 Indirect taxation is themost unfair form of taxation, because it is harder for the poor to pay indirect taxes than it is for the rich. 
 The rich man’s income is ten times or even a hundred times as largeas that of the peasant or worker. 
 But does the rich man needa hundred times as much sugar? Or ten times as much vodka,or matches, or kerosene? Of course not! A rich family willbuy twice, at most, three times as much kerosene, vodka, or sugar as a poor family. 
 But that means that the rich man will pay a smaller part of his income in taxes than the poor man. 
 Let us suppose that the poor peasant’s income is two hundred rubles a year; let us suppose he buys sixty rubles’ worth of such goods as are taxed and which are consequent-ly dearer (the tax on sugar, matches, kerosene, is an excise duty , i. 
e. 
, the manufacturer pays the duty before placing the goods on the market; in the case of vodka, a state monopoly,the State simply raises the price; cotton goods, iron and oth-er goods have risen in price because cheap foreign goodsare not admitted into Russia unless a heavy duty is paid on them). 
 Of these sixty rubles twenty rubles will constitute the tax. 
 Thus, out of every ruble of his income the poor peas-ant will pay ten kopeks in indirect taxes (exclusive of di-rect taxes, land redemption payments, quit-rent, land tax,Zemstvo, volost and mir taxes). 
 The rich peasant has an income of one thousand rubles; he will buy one hundred and fifty rubles’ worth of taxed goods and pay fifty rubles in taxes (included in the one hundred and fifty rubles ). 
 Thus, out of every ruble of his income the rich peasant will payonly five kopeks in indirect taxes. 
 The richer the man, the smaller is the share of his income that he pays in indirect taxes. 
 That is why indirect taxation is the most unfair form of taxation. 
 Indirect taxes are taxes on the poor. 
 The peas-ants and workers together form nine-tenths of the popula-tion and pay nine-tenths or eight-tenths of the total indi-rect taxation. 
 And, in all probability, the income of thepeasants and workers amounts to no more than four-tenthsof the whole national income! And so, the Social-Democrats demand the abolition of indirect taxation and the intro-duction of a progressive tax on incomes and inheritances. 
 That means that the higher the income the higher the tax. 
Those who have an income of a thousand rubles must payone kopek in the ruble; if the income is two thousand, twokopeks in the ruble must be paid, and so on. 
 The smallest incomes (let us say incomes of under four hundred rubles) do not pay anything at all. 
 The richest pay the highest taxes. 
Such a tax, an income -tax, or more exactly, a progressive income -tax, would be much fairer than indirect taxes. 
 And that is why the Social-Democrats are striving to secure theabolition of indirect taxation and the introduction of a pro-gressive income-tax. 
 Of Course, all the property-owners, all the bourgeoisie, object to this measure and resist it. 
Only through a firm alliance between the rural poor and the urban workers can this improvement be won from the bourgeoisie. 
 Finally, the free education of children, which the Social-Democrats demand, would be a very important improve-ment for the whole of the people, and for the rural poor inparticular. 
 Today there are far fewer schools in the country-side than in the towns, and everywhere it is only the richclasses, only the bourgeoisie, who are in a position to give their children a good education. 
 Only free and compulsory education for all children can get the people, at least to some extent, out of their present state of ignorance. 
 Therural poor suffer most from this ignorance and stand in par-ticular need of education. 
 But, of course, we need real,free education, and not the sort the officials and the priests want to give. 
 The Social-Democrats further demand that everybody shall have full and unrestricted right to profess any reli-gion he pleases. 
 Of the European countries Russia and Tur-key are the only ones which have retained shameful lawsagainst persons belonging to any other faith than the Or-thodox, laws against schismatics, sectarians, and Jews. 
 These laws either totally ban a certain religion, or prohib-it its propagation, or deprive those who belong to it ofcertain rights. 
 All these laws are as unjust, as arbitrary andas disgraceful as can be. 
 Everybody must be perfectly free,not only to profess whatever religion he pleases, but also to spread or change his religion . 
 No official should have the right even to ask anyone about his religion: that is a matterfor each person’s conscience and no one has any right to in-terfere. 
 There should be no “ established ” religion or church. 
 All religions and all churches should have equal status inlaw. 
 The clergy of the various religions should be paid sala-ries by those who belong to their religions, but the state should not use state money to support any religion whatever,should not grant money to maintain any clergy, Orthodox,schismatic, sectarian, or any other. 
 That is what the Social-Democrats are fighting for, and until these measures arecarried out without any reservation and without any subter-fuge, the people will not be freed from the disgraceful po-lice persecution of religion, or from the no less disgracefulpolice hand-outs to any one of those religions. 
 * * * We have seen what improvements the Social-Democrats are out to achieve for all the people, and especially for thepoor. 
 Now let us see what improvements they strive toachieve for the workers, not only for factory and urbanworkers, but for agricultural workers too. 
 The factoryworkers live in more cramped conditions; they work in large workshops, so it is easier for them to avail themselves of the assistance of educated Social-Democrats. 
 For all these reasonsthe urban workers started the struggle against the employersmuch earlier than the others and have achieved more consid-erable improvements; they have also obtained the passing offactory laws. 
 But the Social-Democrats are fighting for the extension of these improvements to all the workers: to hand-icraftsmen both in town and country, who work for em-ployers at home; to the wage-workers employed by pettymasters and artisans; to workers in the building trades (car-penters, bricklayers, etc. 
); to lumbermen and unskilledlabourers, and also the agricultural labourers . 
 All over Russia, all these workers are now beginning to unite, fol-lowing the example of, and aided by, the factory workers,to unite for the struggle for better conditions of life, for ashorter working day, for higher wages . 
 And the Social-Democratic Party has set itself the task of supporting all workers in their struggle for a better life, of helping them to organise (to unite) the most resolute and reliable workers in strong unions, of helping them by circulating pamphletsand leaflets, by sending experienced workers to those new tothe movement, and in general helping all the workers in everypossible way. 
 When we have won political liberty, we shallhave our people in a national assembly of deputies, worker deputies, Social-Democrats, and, like their comrades in other countries, they will demand laws for the benefit ofthe workers. 
 We shall not enumerate here all the improvements the Social-Democratic Party is striving to obtain for the work-ers: they have been set out in our programme and explained in detail in the pamphlet, The Workers ’ Cause in Russia . 
 Here it will be sufficient to mention the most importantof those improvements. 
 The working day must not be longer than eight hours. 
 One day a week must always be a day of rest. 
 Overtime must be absolutely banned, and so must night-work. 
 Children up to the age of sixteen must be given free education and, consequently, must not be allowed towork for hire until that age. 
 Women must not work intrades injurious to their health. 
 The employer must compen-sate the workers for all injury caused during work, for exam-ple, for injury caused when working on threshing-machines, winnowing-machines, and so forth. 
 All wage-workers must always be paid weekly , and not once in two months or once in a quarter as is often the case with agricultural labourers. 
It is very important for the workers to be paid regularlyevery week and, moreover, to be paid in cash, and not ingoods. 
 Employers are very fond of making the workers ac-cept all sorts of worthless goods at exorbitant prices in payment of wages; to put an end to this disgraceful practice,the payment of wages in goods must be absolutely prohib-ited by law. 
 Further, aged workers must receive state pen-sions. 
 By their labour the workers maintain all the richclasses, and the whole state, and that gives them as much right to pensions as government officials, who get pensions. 
 To prevent employers from taking advantage of their posi-tion to disregard regulations introduced to protect the work-ers, inspectors must be appointed to supervise, not onlythe factories, but also the big landlord farms and, in general,all enterprises where wage-labour is employed. 
 But those inspectors must not be government officials, or be appoint-ed by ministers or governors, or be in the service of thepolice. 
 The inspectors must be elected by the workers ; the state must pay salaries to persons who enjoy the confidenceof the workers and whom they have freely elected. 
 Theseelected deputies of the workers must also see to it that the workers’ dwellings are kept in proper condition, that the employers dare not compel the workers to live in whatis like pigsties or in mud huts (as is often the case withagricultural labourers), that the rules concerning the work-ers’ rest are observed, and so on. 
 It must not be forgotten,however, that no elected workers’ deputies will be of any use as long as there is no political liberty, as long as the police are all-powerful, and are not responsible to the peo-ple. 
 Everyone knows that at present the police will arrest without trial, not only workers’ deputies but any worker who will dare speak in the name of all his fellow workers, expose breaches of the law, or call on the workers to unite. 
 But when we have political liberty, the workers’ deputieswill be of very great use. 
 All employers (factory owners, landlords, contractors, and rich peasants) should be absolutely forbidden to make any arbitrary deductions from the wages of their workers, for example, deductions for defective goods, deductions in the form of fines, etc. 
 It is unlawful and tyrannical foremployers arbitrarily to make deductions from workers’ wages. 
 The employer must not reduce a worker’s wage bymeans of any deductions, or in any way whatsoever. 
 The em-ployer should not be allowed to pass and execute judgement (a fine sort of judge, who pockets the deductions from the worker’s wages!); he should appeal to a proper court , and this court must consist of deputies elected by the workers andthe employers in equal numbers. 
 Only such a court willbe able to judge fairly all the grievances of the employersagainst the workers and of the workers against the employers. 
 Such are the improvements the Social-Democrats are striv-ing to obtain for the whole of the working class. 
 The workerson every landed estate, on every farm, in the employ ofevery contractor, must meet and discuss with trustworthypersons what improvements they must strive to obtainand what demands they should advance (for the demands of the workers will, of course, be different at different factories, on different estates, and with different con-tractors). 
 All over Russia Social-Democratic committees are help-ing the workers to formulate their demands in a clear andprecise way, and are helping them to issue printed leaflets where these demands are set out, so that they may be known to all workers, and to the employers and the authorities. 
When the workers unite as one man in support of theirdemands, the employers always have to give way and agreeto them. 
 In the towns the workers have already obtainedmany improvements in this way, and now handicraftsmen, artisans, and agricultural labourers are also beginning to unite (to organise) and fight for their demands. 
 As longas we have no political liberty, we carry on the fight in secret, hiding from the police, who prohibit the publication of all leaflets and associations of workers. 
 But when we have won political liberty, we shall carry on the fight on a wider scale and openly, so that working people all over Russia mayunite and defend themselves more vigorously from oppres-sion. 
 The larger the number of workers who unite in the workers ’ Social-Democratic Party , the stronger will they be, the sooner will they be able to achieve the complete emancipation of the working class from all oppression, from all wage-labour, from all toil for the benefit of the bour-geoisie. 
 * * * We have already said that the Social-Democratic Labour Party is striving to obtain improvements, not only for the workers, but also for all the peasants . 
 Now let us see what improvements it is striving to obtain for all the peas-ants.

 WHAT IMPROVEMENTS ARE THE SOCIAL-DEMOCRATS STRIVING TO OBTAIN FOR ALL THE PEASANTS? To secure the complete emancipation of all working people, the rural poor must, in alliance with the urbanworkers, wage a fight against the whole of the bourgeoisie,including the rich peasants. 
 The rich peasants will strive to pay their farm labourers as little as possible and make them work as long and as hard as possible; but the workersin town and countryside will try to secure better wages,better conditions, and regular rest periods for farm labourersworking for the rich peasants. 
 That means that the ruralpoor must form their own unions apart from the rich peasants. 
 We have already said this, and we shall always repeat it. 
 But in Russia, all peasants, rich and poor, are still serfs in many respects; they are an inferior , “black ”, tax-paying social-estate ; they are all serfs of the police officers and rural superintendents; very often they have to work for the land-lord in payment for the use of the cut-off lands, watering places, pastures or meadows, just as they worked for the feudal lord under the serf-owning system. 
 All the peasants want to be free of this new serfdom; all of them want to have full rights; all of them hate the landlords, who still com-pel them to perform serf labour , to pay “labour rent” for the use of the gentry’s land and pastures, watering places and meadows, to work also “for damage” done by strayingcattle and to send their womenfolk to reap the landlord’sfield merely “for the honour of it”. 
 All this labour rent forthe landlord is a heavier burden for the poor peasants thanfor the rich peasants. 
 The rich peasant is sometimes able to pay the landlord money in lieu of this work, but as a rule even the rich peasant is badly squeezed by the landlord. 
Hence, the rural poor must fight side by side with the richpeasants against their lack of rights, against every kindof serf labour, against every kind of labour rent. 
 We shallbe able to abolish all bondage, all poverty only when we defeat the bourgeoisie as a whole (including the rich peas-ants). 
 But there are forms of bondage which we can abolishbefore that time , because even the rich peasant suffers bad-ly from them. 
 There are many localities and many districtsin Russia where very often all the peasants are still quitelike serfs. 
 That is why all Russian workers and all the rural poor must fight with both hands and on two sides : with one hand— fight against all the bourgeois , in alliance with all the workers; and with the other hand— fight against the rural officials, against the feudal landlords , in alli-ance with all the peasants. 
 If the rural poor do not form theirown union separately from the rich peasants they will be deceived by the rich peasants, who will become landlords themselves, while the landless poor will not only remainpoor and without land but will not even be granted freedomto unite. 
 If the rural poor do not fight side by side with therich peasants against feudal bondage, they will remainfettered and tied down to one place, neither will they gain full freedom to unite with the urban workers. 
 The rural poor must first strike at the landlords and throw off at least the most vicious and most pernicious formsof feudal bondage; in this fight many of the rich peasantsand adherents of the bourgeoisie will also take the side ofthe poor, because everybody is disgusted with the arro-gance of the landlords. 
 But as soon as we have curtailed the power of the landlords, the rich peasant will at once revealhis true character and stretch out greedy hands to grab everything; these are rapacious hands and they have al-ready grabbed a great deal. 
 Hence, we must be on our guard and form a strong, indestructible alliance with the urban workers. 
 The urban workers will help to knock theold aristocratic habits out of the landlords and also tamethe rich peasants a bit (as they have already somewhat tamedtheir own bosses, the factory owners). 
 Without an alliancewith the urban workers the rural poor will never rid them-selves of all forms of bondage, want, and poverty; except for the urban workers, there is no one to help the rural poor, and they can count on no one but themselves. 
 Butthere are improvements which we can obtain earlier, whichwe can obtain immediately, at the very outset of this greatstruggle. 
 There are many forms of bondage in Russia which have long ceased to exist in other countries, and it is from this bondage imposed by the officials and landlords, thisfeudal bondage, that the Russian peasantry as a whole can free itself immediately . 
 Let us now see what improvements the workers’ So-cial-Democratic Party is striving first of all to obtain so as to free the Russian peasantry as a whole from at least the most vicious forms of feudal bondage, and so as to untiethe hands of the rural poor for their struggle against theRussian bourgeoisie as a whole. 
 The first demand of the workers’ Social-Democratic Party is the immediate abolition of all land redemption payments, all quit-rent, and all the dues imposed upon the “tax-paying” peasantry. 
 When the committees of noblesand the Russian tsar’s government, consisting of nobles,“emancipated” the peasants from serfdom, the peasantswere compelled to buy out their own land, to buy out the land which they had tilled for generations! That was rob-bery . 
 The committees of nobles, assisted by the tsarist government, simply robbed the peasants. 
 The tsarist govern-ment sent troops to many places to impose the title-deeds 126 upon the peasants by force , to take military punitive meas-ures against the peasants, who were unwilling to acceptthe curtailed “pauper” allotments. 
 Without the help of the troops, without brutality and shootings, the committees of nobles would never have been able to rob the peasantsin the brazen way they did at the time of the emancipation from serfdom. 
 The peasants must always remember how they were cheated and robbed by those committees of land-owning nobles, because even today the tsarist government always appoints committees of nobles or officials wheneverit is a question of passing new laws concerning the peasants. 
The tsar recently issued a manifesto (February 26, 1903),in which he promises to revise and improve the laws con-cerning the peasants. 
 Who will do the revising? Who will do the improving? Again the nobility, again the officials! The peasants will always be defrauded until they secure thesetting up of peasant committees for the purpose of improv-ing their conditions of life. 
 It is time to put a stop to thelandlords, rural superintendents, and all kinds of officialslording it over the peasants! It is time to put a stop to this feudal dependence of the peasant upon every police offi-cer, upon every drink-sodden scion of the nobility who iscalled a rural superintendent, a police chief, or a governor!The peasants must demand freedom to manage their affairsthemselves , freedom to consider, propose, and carry out new laws themselves . 
 The peasants must demand the setting up of free, elected peasant committees , and until they obtain this they will always be defrauded and robbed by the no-bility and the officials. 
 No one will free the peasants fromthe official leeches, if they do not free themselves, if theydo not unite and take their fate into their own hands. 
 The Social-Democrats not only demand the complete and immediate abolition of land redemption payments, quit-rent, and imposts of all kinds; they also demand thatmoney taken from the people in the form of land redemptionpayments should be restituted to the people . 
 Hundreds of millions of rubles have been paid up by peasants allover Russia since they were emancipated from serfdom by the committees of nobles. 
 The peasants must demand that this money be returned to them. 
 Let the government imposea special tax on the big landed nobility; let the land be takenfrom the monasteries and from the Department of Demesnes(i. 
e. 
, from the tsar’s family); let the national assembly ofdeputies use this money for the benefit of the peasants. 
 Nowhere in the world is the peasant so downtrodden or so impoverished as is in Russia. 
 Nowhere do millions of peasantsdie so horribly of starvation as they do in Russia. 
 The peasants in Russia have been reduced to dying of starvation because they were robbed long ago by the committees of nobles, and are being robbed to this day by being forced to pay tribute to the heirs of the feudal landlords every year in theform of redemption payments and quit-rent. 
 The robbersmust be made to answer for their crimes! Let money be takenaway from the big landed nobility so as to provide effectiverelief for the famine-stricken. 
 The starving peasant does not need charity, he does not need paltry doles; he must demand the return of the money he has paid for years andyears to the landlords and to the state. 
 The national as-sembly of deputies and the peasant committees will thenbe able to give real and effective assistance to the starving. 
 Further. 
 The Social-Democratic Labour Party demands the immediate abolition of collective liability and of all laws restricting the peasant in the free disposal of his land . 
 The tsar’s Manifesto of February 26,1903, promises the abo-lition of collective liability. 
 A law to this effect hasalready been passed. 
 But this is not enough. 
 All laws that prevent the peasant from freely disposing of his land must be abolished immediately; otherwise, even without col-lective liability the peasant will not be quite free and will remain a semi-serf. 
 The peasant must be quite free to dis-pose of his land: to let or sell it to whomsoever he pleases,without having to ask for permission from anyone. 
 Thatis what the tsar’s ukase does not permit: the gentry, the merchants, and the townspeople are free to dispose of their land, but the peasant is not. 
 The peasant is a little child,who must have a rural superintendent to look after himlike a nurse. 
 The peasant must not be allowed to sell hisallotment, for he will squander the money! That is howthe feudal die-hards argue, and there are simpletons who believe them and, wishing the peasant well, say that he must not be allowed to sell his land. 
 Even the Narodniks(of whom we have already spoken) and the people who callthemselves “Socialist-Revolutionaries” also yield to thisargument and agree that it is bettor for the peasant to remainsomewhat of a serf rather than be allowed to sell his land. 
 The Social-Democrats say: that is sheer hypocrisy, aristocratic talk, merely honeyed words! When we haveattained socialism, and the working class has defeated the bourgeoisie, the land will be owned in common and nobody will have the right to sell land. 
 But what in the meantime? Are the nobleman and the merchant to be allowed to sell their land, while the peasant is not!? Are the nobleman andthe merchant to be free while the peasant remains a semi-serf!? Is the peasant to continue to have to beg permissionfrom the authorities!? All this is mere deceit, though covered up with honeyed words, but it is deceit for all that. 
 As long as the nobleman and the merchant are allowed to sell land, the peasant must also have full right to sell his land and to dispose of it with complete freedom , in exactly the same way as the nobleman and the merchant. 
 When the working class has defeated the entire bourgeoi-sie, it will take the land away from the big proprietors and introduce co-operative farming on the big estates, so that the workers will farm the land together, in common,and freely elect delegates to manage the farms. 
 They willhave all kinds of labour-saving machines, and work in shiftsfor not more than eight (or even six) hours a day. 
 The small peasant who prefers to carry on his farm in the old way on individual lines will not then produce for the market, tosell to the first comer, but for the workers’ co-operatives;the small peasant will supply the workers’ co-operatives withgrain, meat, vegetables, and the workers in return willprovide him free of charge with machines, livestock, fer-tilisers, clothes, and whatever else he needs. 
 There will then be no struggle for money between the big and the smallfarmer; there will then be no working for hire for others;all workers will work for themselves, all improvements inmethods of production and all machines will benefit theworkers themselves and help to make their work easier, improve their standard of living. 
 But every sensible man understands that socialism can-not be attained at once: to attain it a fierce struggle mustbe waged against the entire bourgeoisie and all governments;all urban workers all over Russia must unite in a firm andunbreakable alliance with all the rural poor. 
 That is a great cause, and to that cause it is worth devoting one’s whole life. 
 But until we have attained socialism, the bigowner will always fight the small owner for money. 
 Is the big landowner to be free to sell his land, while the small peasant is not? We repeat: the peasants are not little chil-dren and will not allow anyone to lord it over them; the peas-ants must receive, without any restriction, all the rights enjoyed by the nobility and the merchants. 
 It is also said: the peasant’s land is not his own, but com-munal land. 
 Everyone cannot be allowed to sell communalland. 
 This, too, is a deception. 
 Have not the nobles and the merchants their associations too? Do not the nobles and the merchants combine to float companies for the jointpurchase of land, factories, or any other thing? Why thenare no restrictions invented for the associations of the no-bility, while the police scoundrels zealously think uprestrictions and prohibitions for the peasantry? The peasants have never received anything good from the officials, except beatings, extortions, and bullying. 
 The peasants will neverreceive anything good until they take their affairs into theirown hands, until they obtain complete equality of rights andcomplete liberty. 
 If the peasants want their land to be com-munal, no one will dare to interfere with them; and they will voluntarily form an association which will include whomsoever they like, and on whatever terms they like;they will quite freely draw up a communal contract in what-ever form they like. 
 And let no official dare poke his noseinto the communal affairs of the peasants. 
 Let no one dareexercise his wits on the peasants and invent restrictions and prohibitions for them. 
 * * * Lastly, there is another important improvement which the Social-Democrats are striving to obtain for the peas-ants. 
 They want immediately to impose limits on the peas-ants’ bondage to the nobility, their serf bondage. 
 Of coursebondage cannot be completely abolished as long as povertyexists, and poverty cannot be abolished as long as the landand the factories are in the hands of the bourgeoisie, as longas money is the principal power in the world, and until a socialist society has been established. 
 But in the Russian countryside there is still much bondage of a particularlyvicious sort which does not exist in other countries, although socialism has not yet been established there. 
 There is still much serf bondage in Russia which is profitable to all the landlords, weighs heavily on all the peasants, and can and must be abolished immediately, in the first place. 
 Let us explain the sort of bondage we call serf bondage. 
Everyone who lives in the country knows cases like the following. 
 The landlord’s land adjoins the peasant’s land. 
At the time of the emancipation the peasants were deprived of land that was indispensable to them: pasture, woodland, and watering places were cut off. 
 The peasants cannot dowithout this cut-off land, without pastures and wateringplaces. 
 Whether they like it or not the peasants are forcedto go to the landlord to ask him to let their cattle to goto the water, to graze on the pastures, and so forth. 
 The land-lord does not farm any land himself and, perhaps, has no money; he lives only by keeping the peasants in thrall. 
 Inreturn for the use of the cut-off lands the peasants work forhim for nothing; they plough his land with their horses, har-vest his grain and mow his hay, thresh his grain, and in someplaces even have to cart their manure to the landlord’s fields, or bring him homespun cloth, and eggs and poultry. 
 Just as under serfdom! Under serfdom the peasants had towork for nothing for the landlord on whose estate theylived, and today they very often have to work for nothing forthe landlord in return for the very same land which the com-mittees of nobles filched from them at the time of the eman-cipation. 
 It is just the same as the corvée system. 
 In some gubernias the peasants themselves call this system bar-shchina , or panshchina . 
 Well, that is what we call serf bond-age. 
 At the time of the emancipation from serfdom the com-mittees of landowning nobles deliberately arranged mat-ters in such a way as to keep the peasants in bondage in the old way. 
 They would deliberately dock the peasants’ allot-ments; they would drive a wedge of the landlord’s land inbetween peasants’ holdings so as to make it impossiblefor the peasant even to let his poultry out without trespass-ing; they would deliberately transfer the peasants to in-ferior land, deliberately block the way to the watering place by a strip of landlord’s land—in short, they arranged matters in such a way that the peasants should find them-selves in a trap, and, just as before, could easily be taken captive. 
 There are still countless numbers of villages where the peasants are in captivity to nearby landlords, just as much as they were under serfdom. 
 In villages like these, both the rich peasant and the poor peasant are bound handand foot and at the mercy of the landlords. 
 The poor peas-ant fares even worse than the rich peasant from this stateof affairs. 
 The rich peasant sometimes owns some land andsends his labourer to work for the landlord instead of going himself, but the poor peasant has no way out, and the land-lord does what he likes to him. 
 Under this bondage the poorpeasant often has not even a moment’s breathing-space;he cannot go to look for work elsewhere because of the workhe has to do for his landlord; he cannot even think of freelyuniting in one union, in one party, with all the rural poor and the urban workers. 
 Well then, are there no means by which it would be pos-sible to abolish this sort of bondage at once, forthwith, imme-diately? The Social-Democratic Labour Party proposes tothe peasants two means to this end. 
 But we must repeat that only socialism can deliver all the poor from bondage of every kind, for as long as the rich have power they will always op-press the poor in one way or another. 
 It is impossible toabolish all bondage at once, but it is possible greatly torestrict the most vicious, the most revolting form of bond-age, serf bondage, which weighs heavily on the poor, onthe middle and even on the rich peasants; it is possible to obtain immediate relief for the peasants. 
 There are two means to this end. 
First means: freely elected courts consisting of delegates of the farm labourers and poor peasants, as well as of the richpeasants and landlords. 
 Second means: freely elected peasant committees . 
 These peasant committees must have the right, not only to discuss and adopt all kinds of measures for abolishing the corvée,for abolishing the remnants of serfdom, but they must alsohave the right to expropriate the cut-off lands and restore them to the peasants . 
 Let us consider these two means a little more closely. 
 The freely elected delegate courts will consider all cases arising out of complaints of peasants against bondage. 
 Suchcourts will have the right to reduce rents for land if the landlord, taking advantage of the peasants’ poverty, has fixed them too high. 
 Such courts will have the right to free the peasants from exorbitant payments; when a landlord engages a peasant in the winter for summer work at an ex-cessively low wage, the court will judge the case and fix afair wage. 
 Of course, such courts must not consist of offici-als, but of freely elected delegates, and the agriculturallabourers and the rural poor must also without fail elect their delegates, whose number must not in any case be less than those elected by the rich peasants and the landlords. 
 Suchcourts will also try disputes between labourers and employ-ers. 
 When such courts exist it will be easier for the labour-ers and all the rural poor to defend their rights, to unite andto find out exactly what people can be trusted to stand up faithfully for the poor and for the labourers. 
 The other means is still more important: the establish-ment of free peasant committees consisting of elected dele-gates of the farm labourers and poor, middle and rich peas-ants in every uyezd (or, if the peasants think fit, they mayelect several committees in each uyezd; perhaps they will even prefer to establish peasant committees in every vo-lost and in every large village). 
 No one knows better thanthe peasants themselves what bondage oppresses them. 
No one will be able to expose the landlords, who to this daylive by keeping the peasants in thrall, better than the peas-ants themselves. 
 The peasant committees will decide what cut-off lands, what meadows, pastures, and so forth, were taken from the peasants unfairly; they will decide whetherthose lands shall be expropriated without compensation, orwhether those who bought such lands should be paid compen-sation at the expense of the high nobility. 
 The peasant com-mittees will at least release the peasants from the traps into which they were driven by very many committees of the landowning nobles. 
 The peasant committees will rid thepeasants of interference by officials; they will show thatthe peasants themselves want to, and can, manage theirown affairs; they will help the peasants to reach agreementamong themselves about their needs and to recognise those who are really able to stand up for the rural poor and for an alliance with the urban workers. 
 The peasant committeeswill be the first step towards enabling the peasants even in remote villages to get on to their feet and to take their fate into their own hands. 
 That is why the Social-Democratic workers warn the peasants: Place no faith in any committees of nobles , or in any com-missions consisting of officials . 
 Demand a national assembly of deputies. 
Demand the establishment of peasant committees. 
 Demand complete freedom to publish pamphlets and news-papers of every kind. 
 When all have the right freely and fearlessly to express their opinions and their wishes in the national assemblyof deputies, in the peasant committees, and in the newspapers,it will very soon be seen who is on the side of the working class and who is on the side of the bourgeoisie. 
 Today, the great majority of the people do not think about these thingsat all; some conceal their real views, some do not yet knowtheir own minds, and some lie deliberately. 
 But when thisright has been won, everyone will begin to think about thesethings; there will be no reason for concealing anything, and everything will soon become clear. 
 We have already said that the bourgeoisie will draw the rich peasants to its side. 
The sooner and the more completely we succeed in abolish-ing serf bondage, and the more real freedom the peasantsobtain for themselves, the sooner will the rural poor uniteamong themselves, and the sooner will the rich peasants unite with all the bourgeoisie. 
 Let them unite: we are not afraid of that, although we know perfectly well that thiswill strengthen the rich peasants. 
 But we, too, will unite,and our union , the union between the rural poor and the ur-ban workers, will embrace far more people. 
 It will be a unionof tens of millions against a union of hundreds of thousands. 
 We also know that the bourgeoisie will try (it is already trying!) to attract the middle and even the small peasants toits side; it will try to deceive them, entice them, sow dissen-sion among them, and promise to raise each of them intothe ranks of the rich. 
 We have already seen the means andthe deceit the bourgeoisie resort to in order to lure the middle peasant. 
 We must therefore open the eyes of the rural poor beforehand, and consolidate in advance their separateunion with the urban workers against the entire bourgeoisie. 
 Let every villager look around carefully. 
 How often we hear the rich peasants talking against the nobility, against the landlords! How they complain of the oppression the people suffer from! Or of the landlords’ land lying idle!How they love to talk (in private conversation) about whata good thing it would be if the peasants took possession ofthe land! Can we believe what the rich peasants say? No. 
 They do not want the land for the people; they want it for them-selves. 
 They have already got hold of a great deal of land,bought outright or rented, and still they are not satisfied. 
Hence , the rural poor will not long have to march side by side with the rich peasants against the landlords . 
 Only the first step will have to be taken in their company, and after that their ways will part. 
 That is why we must draw a clear distinction between this first step and subsequent steps , and our final and most impor-tant step . 
 The first step in the countryside will be the com-plete emancipation of the peasant, full rights for the peasant,and the establishment of peasant committees for the pur-pose of restoring the cut-off lands. 
 But our final step will be the same in both town and country: we shall take all the land and all the factories from the landlords and the bour-geoisie and set up a socialist society . 
 We shall have to go through a big struggle in the period between our first stepand the final, and whoever confuses the first step with the final weakens that struggle and unwittingly helps to hood-wink the rural poor. 
 The rural poor will take the first step together with all the peasants: a few kulaks may fall out, perhaps one peasant ina hundred is willing to put up with any kind of bondage. 
But the overwhelming mass of the peasants will, as yet, advance as one whole: all the peasants want equal rights. 
 Bondage to the landlords ties everyone hand and foot. 
 Butthe final step will never be taken by all the peasants togeth-er: then, all the rich peasants will turn against the farmlabourers. 
 Then, it is a strong union of the rural poor and theurban Social-Democratic workers that we need. 
 Whoever tells the peasants that they can take the first and the final step simultaneously is deceiving them. 
 He forgets about thegreat struggle that is going on among the peasants them-selves, the great struggle between the rural poor and the rich peasants. 
 That is why the Social-Democrats do not promise the peasants immediately a land flowing with milk and honey. 
 That is why the Social-Democrats first of all demand com-plete freedom for the struggle, for the great, nation-widestruggle of the entire working class against the entire bour-geoisie. 
 That is why the Social-Democrats advise a small but sure first step . 
 Some people think that our demand for the establishment of peasant committees for the purpose of restricting bondageand of restoring the cut-off lands is a sort of fence or barrier,as if we meant to say: stop, not a step farther! These peoplehave given insufficient thought to what the Social-Democrats want. 
 The demand for peasant committees to be set up for the purpose of restricting bondage and of restoring the cut-off lands is not a barrier. 
 It is a door . 
 We must first pass through this door in order to go farther , to march along the wide and open road to the very end , to the complete emanci-pation of all working people in Russia. 
 Until the peasants pass through this door they will remain in ignorance and bondage, without full rights, without complete and realliberty; they will not even be able to decide definitely amongthemselves who is the friend of the working man and whohis enemy. 
 That is why the Social-Democrats point to thisdoor and say that the entire people must all together first force this door and smash it in. 
 But there are people who call themselves Narodniks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, whoalso wish the peasant well, shout and make a noise, wavetheir arms about and want to help him, but they do not see that door ! Those people are so blind that they even say: there is no need at all to give the peasant the right freely to dispose of his land! They wish the peasant well, but some-times they argue exactly like the feudal die-hards! Suchfriends can be of little help. 
 What is the use of wishing thepeasant all the best if you don’t clearly see the very firstdoor that must be smashed? What is the use of wanting so-cialism if you don’t see how to enter on the road of a free, people’s struggle for socialism, not only in the towns, but also in the countryside, not only against the landlords, butalso against the rich peasants in the village commune , the “mir”? That is why the Social-Democrats point so insistently to this first and nearest door. 
 The difficult thing at this stage is not to express a lot of good wishes, but to point to the right road, to understand clearly how the very first step should be taken . 
 All friends of the peasant have been talking and writing for the past forty years about the Russian peasantbeing crushed by bondage and about his remaining a semi-serf. 
 Long before there were any Social-Democrats in Rus-sia, the friends of the peasant wrote many books describing how shamefully the landlords robbed and enslaved the peas-ant by means of the various cut-off lands. 
 All honest peoplenow realise that the peasant must be given assistance atonce, immediately, that he must get at least some relief fromthis bondage; even officials in our police government are be-ginning to talk about this. 
 The whole question is: how to set about it , how to take the first step , which door must be forced first? To this question different people (among those who wish the peasant well) give two different answers. 
 Every ruralproletarian must try to understand these two answers as clearly as possible and form a definite and firm opinion about them. 
 One answer is given by the Narodniks and the Social-ist-Revolutionaries. 
 The first thing to be done, they say,is to develop all sorts of societies (co-operatives) among thepeasants. 
 The unity of the mir must be strengthened. 
 Every peasant should not be given the right to dispose of his land freely. 
 Let the rights of the commune, the mir, be extended, and let all the land in Russia gradually become communalland. 
 The peasants must be granted every assistance to pur-chase land, so that the land may more easily pass from capi-tal to labour. 
 The other answer is given by the Social-Democrats. 
 The peasant must first of all obtain for himself all the rights possessed by the nobility and the merchants, all withoutexception. 
 The peasant must have full right to disposefreely of his land. 
 In order to abolish the most revoltingforms of bondage, peasant committees must be set up forthe purpose of restoring the cut-off lands. 
 We need not the unity of the mir, but unity of the rural poor in the different village communes all over Russia, unity of the rural prole-tarians with the urban proletarians. 
 All sorts of societies (co-operatives) and the communal purchase of land will always benefit the rich peasants most, and will always serve to hoodwink the middle peasants. 
 The Russian Government realises that some relief must be given to the peasants, but it wants to make shift with tri-fles; it wants everything to be done by the officials. 
 Thepeasants must be on the alert, because commissions of of-ficials will cheat them just as they were cheated by the committees of nobles. 
 The peasants must demand the elec-tion of free peasant committees. 
 The important thingis not to expect improvement from the officials, but forthe peasants to take their fate into their own hands. 
 Let us atfirst take only one step, at first abolish only the viciousforms of bondage—so that the peasants should become con-scious of their strength, so that they should freely reach a common agreement and unite! No honest person can denythat the cut-off lands often serve as the instruments of themost outrageous serf bondage. 
 No honest person can deny thatour demand is the primary and fairest of demands: let thepeasants freely elect their own committees, without the offi-cials, for the purpose of abolishing all serf bondage. 
 In the free peasant committees (just as in the free all-Russian assembly of deputies) the Social-Democrats will atonce do all in their power to consolidate a distinct union ofthe rural proletarians with the urban proletarians. 
 The So-cial-Democrats will make a stand for all measures for the benefit of the rural proletarians and will help them to follow up the first step, as quickly as possible and as unitedly aspossible, with the second and the third step, and so on tothe very end, to the complete victory of the proletariat . 
 But can we say today, at once, what demand will be appropriatetomorrow for the second step? No, we cannot, because we do not know what stand will be taken tomorrow by the rich peasants, and by many educated people who are concernedwith all kinds of co-operatives and with the land passingfrom capital to labour. 
 Perhaps they will not yet succeed in reaching an under-standing with the landlords on the morrow; perhaps they will want to put an end to landlord rule completely. 
 Very good! The Social-Democrats would very much like this tohappen, and they will advise rural and urban proletarians to demand that all the land be taken from the landlords and transferred to the free people’s state. 
 The Social-Democrats will vigilantly see to it that the rural proletarians are not cheated in the course of this, and that they still further con-solidate their forces for the final struggle for the completeemancipation of the proletariat. 
 But things may turn out quite differently. 
 In fact, it is more likely that they will turn out differently. 
 On the very day after the worst forms of bondage have been re-stricted and curtailed, the rich peasants and many educatedpeople may unite with the landlords, and then the entirerural bourgeoisie will rise against the entire rural proletar-iat. 
 In that event it would be ridiculous for us to fight onlythe landlords. 
 We would then have to fight the entire bour-geoisie and demand first of all the greatest possible freedom and elbow-room for this fight, demand better conditionsof life for the workers in order to facilitate this struggle. 
 In any case, whichever way things turn out, our first, our principal and indispensable task is to strengthen the alliance of the rural proletarians and semi-proletarians with the urban proletarians . 
 For this alliance we need at once, immediately, complete political liberty for the people , complete equality of rights for the peasants and the aboli-tion of serf bondage . 
 And when that alliance is established and strengthened, we shall easily expose all the deceitthe bourgeoisie resorts to in order to attract the middle peasant; we shall easily and quickly take the second, the third and the last step against the entire bourgeoisie, againstall the government forces, and we shall unswervingly marchto victory and rapidly achieve the complete emancipation of all working people . 
 7. 
 THE CLASS STRUGGLE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE What is the class struggle ? It is a struggle of one part of the people against the other; a struggle waged by the massesof those who have no rights, are oppressed and engage intoil, against the privileged, the oppressors and drones; a struggle of the wage-labourers, or proletarians, against the property-owners, or bourgeoisie. 
 This great struggle hasalways gone on and is now going on in the Russian coun-tryside too, although not everyone sees it, and although not everyone understands its significance. 
 In the period of serfdom the entire mass of the peasants fought against their oppressors, the landlord class, which was protected, defended,and supported by the tsarist government. 
 The peasantswere then unable to unite and were utterly crushed by ig-norance; they had no helpers and brothers among the urbanworkers; nevertheless they fought as best they could. 
 They were not deterred by the brutal persecution of the govern-ment, were not daunted by punitive measures and bullets,and did not believe the priests, who tried with all their mightto prove that serfdom was approved by Holy Scripture andsanctioned by God (that is what Metropolitan Philaretactually said!); the peasants rose in rebellion, now in one place and now in another, and at last the government yielded, fearing a general uprising of all the peasants. 
 Serfdom was abolished, but not altogether. 
 The peasants remained without rights, remained an inferior, tax-paying,“black” social-estate, remained in the clutches of serfbondage. 
 Unrest among the peasants continues; they con-tinue to seek complete, real freedom. 
 Meanwhile, after the abolition of serfdom, a new class struggle arose, the struggle of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie . 
 Wealth increased, railways and big factories were built, the towns grew stillmore populous and more luxurious, but all this wealth wasappropriated by a very few, while the people became poorer all the time, became ruined, starved, and had to leave their homes to go and hire themselves out for wages. 
 Theurban workers started a great, new struggle of all the pooragainst all the rich. 
 The urban workers have united in the Social-Democratic Party and are waging their struggle stub-bornly, staunchly, and solidly, advancing step by step, preparing for the great final struggle, and demanding polit-ical liberty for all the people. 
 At last the peasants, too, lost patience. 
 In the spring of last year, 1902, the peasants of Poltava, Kharkov, and othergubernias rose against the landlords, broke open their barns,shared the contents among themselves, distributed among the starving the grain that had been sown and reaped by the peasants but appropriated by the landlords, and demandeda new division of the land. 
 The peasants could no longer bear the endless oppression, and began to seek a better lot. 
 The peasants decided—and quite rightly so—that it was better to die fighting the oppressors than to die of starvation without a struggle. 
 But they did not win a betterlot for themselves. 
 The tsarist government proclaimedthem common rioters and robbers (for having taken fromthe robber landlords grain which the peasants themselveshad sown and reaped!); the tsarist government sent troops against them as against an enemy, and the peasants were defeated; peasants were shot down, many were killed; peas-ants were brutally flogged, many were flogged to death;they were tortured worse than the Turks torture their ene-mies, the Christians. 
 The tsar’s envoys, the governors, werethe worst torturers, real executioners. 
 The soldiers raped the wives and daughters of the peasants. 
 And after all this, the peasants were tried by a court of officials, were com-pelled to pay the landlords 800,000 rubles, and at thetrials, those infamous secret trials, trials in a torturechamber, counsels for the defence were not even allowed totell how the peasants had been ill-treated and tortured by the tsar’s envoys, Governor Obolensky, and the other ser-vants of the tsar. 
 The peasants fought in a just cause. 
 The Russian working class will always honour the memory of the martyrs whowere shot down and flogged to death by the tsar’s servants. 
Those martyrs fought for the freedom and happiness of the working people. 
 The peasants were defeated, but they will rise again and again, and will not lose heart because ofthis first defeat. 
 The class-conscious workers will do all intheir power to inform the largest possible number of workingpeople in town and country about the peasants’ struggleand to help them prepare for another and more successful struggle. 
 The class-conscious workers will do all in their power to help the peasants clearly to understand why the first peasant uprising (1902) was crushed and what must be done in order to secure victory for the peasants andworkers and not for the tsar’s servants. 
 The peasant uprising was crushed because it was an up-rising of an ignorant and politically unconscious mass, an uprising without clear and definite political demands, i. 
e. 
, without the demand for a change in the political order. 
 The peasant uprising was crushed because no preparations had been made for it. 
 The peasant uprising was crushed because the rural proletarians had not yet allied themselves with the urban proletarians. 
 Such were the three causes of thepeasants’ first failure. 
 To be successful an insurrection musthave a conscious political aim; preparations must be madefor it in advance; it must spread throughout the whole ofRussia and be in alliance with the urban workers. 
 And every step in the struggle of the urban workers, every Social-Demo-cratic pamphlet or newspaper, every speech made by aclass-conscious worker to the rural proletarians will bringnearer the time when the insurrection will be repeated andend in victory. 
 The peasants rose without a conscious political aim, simply because they could not bear their sufferings any longer, because they did not want to die like dumb brutes,without resistance. 
 The peasants had suffered so much fromevery manner of robbery, oppression, and torment that theycould not but believe, if only for a moment, the vague ru-mours about the tsar’s mercy; they could not but believe that every sensible man would regard it as just that grain should be distributed among starving people, among thosewho had worked all their lives for others, had sown andreaped, and were now dying of starvation, while the “gen-try’s” barns were full to bursting. 
 The peasants seemed tohave forgotten that the best land and all the factories had been seized by the rich, by the landlords and the bourgeoi-sie, precisely for the purpose of compelling the starvingpeople to work for them. 
 The peasants forgot that not onlydo the priests preach sermons in defence of the rich class,but the entire tsarist government, with its host of bureaucratsand soldiers, rises in its defence. 
 The tsarist government re-minded the peasants of that. 
 With brutal cruelty, the tsarist government showed the peasants what state power is, whoseservant and whose protector it is. 
 We need only remind thepeasants of this lesson more often, and they will easily un-derstand why it is necessary to change the political order , and why we need political liberty . 
 Peasant uprisings will have a conscious political aim when that is understood by larger and larger numbers of people, when every peasantwho can read and write and who thinks for himself becomes familiar with the three principal demands which must be fought for first of all. 
 The first demand—the convocation of a national assembly of deputies for the purpose of establish-ing popular elective government in Russia in place of theautocratic government . 
 The second demand— freedom for all to publish all kinds of books and newspapers . 
 The third demand— recognition by law of the peasants ’ complete equal-ity of rights with the other social-estates , and the institu-tion of elected peasant committees with the primary object of abolishing all forms of serf bondage . 
 Such are the chief and fundamental demands of the Social-Democrats, and itwill now be very easy for the peasants to understand them, tounderstand what to begin with in the struggle for the people’s freedom. 
 When the peasants understand these demands, they will also understand that long, persistent and persever-ing preparations must be made in advance for the struggle, not in isolation, but together with the workers in the towns—the Social-Democrats. 
 Let every class-conscious worker and peasant rally around himself the most intelligent, reliable, and fearless comrades. 
 Let him strive to explain to them what the Social-Democrats want, so that every one of them may understand the strugglethat must be waged and the demands that must be advanced. 
Let the class-conscious Social-Democrats begin gradually,cautiously, but unswervingly, to teach the peasants the doc-trine of Social-Democracy, give them Social-Democratic pamphlets to read and explain those pamphlets at small gatherings of trustworthy people. 
 But the doctrine of Social-Democracy must not be taught from books alone; every instance, every case of oppressionand injustice we see around us must be used for this purpose. 
The Social-Democratic doctrine is one of struggle against all oppression, all robbery, all injustice. 
 Only he who knows the causes of oppression and who all his life fights every case of oppression is a real Social-Democrat. 
 How can this be done? When they gather in their town or village, class-con-scious Social-Democrats must themselves decide how it mustbe done to the best advantage of the entire working class. 
 To show how it must be done I shall cite one or two examples. 
 Let us suppose that a Social-Democratic worker has come ona visit to his village, or that some urban Social-Democratic worker has come to any village. 
 The entire village is in the clutches of the neighbouring landlord, like a fly in a spider’s web; it has always been in this state of bondage and cannot escape from it. 
 The worker must at once pick out the mostsensible, intelligent, and trustworthy peasants, those who areseeking justice and will not be frightened by the first policeagent who comes along, and explain to them the causes ofthis hopeless bondage, tell them how the landlords cheated the peasants and robbed them with the aid of the committees of nobles, tell them how strong the rich are and how theyare supported by the tsarist government, and also tell themabout the demands of the Social-Democratic workers. 
 Whenthe peasants understand all these simple things they mustall put their heads together and discuss whether it is possi-ble to put up united resistance to the landlord, whether it is possible to put forward the first and principal demands (inthe same way as the urban workers present their demands tothe factory owners). 
 If the landlord holds one big village, orseveral villages, in bondage, the best thing would be to obtain,through trustworthy people, a leaflet from the nearest So-cial-Democratic committee. 
 In the leaflet the Social-Demo-cratic committee will correctly describe, from the very be-ginning, the bondage the peasants suffer from and formulatetheir most immediate demands (reduction of rent paid forland, proper rates, and not half-rates, of pay for winterhire, or less persecution for damage done by straying cattle or various other demands). 
 From such a leaflet all peasants who can read and write will get to know very well what theissue is, and those who cannot read will have it explained tothem. 
 The peasants will then clearly see that the Social-Democrats support them, that the Social-Democrats con-demn all robbery. 
 The peasants will then begin to under-stand what relief, if only slight, but relief for all that, can be obtained now, at once, if all stand together, and what bigimprovements for the whole country they must seek toobtain by a great struggle in conjunction with the Social-Democratic workers in the towns. 
 The peasants will thenprepare more and more for that great struggle; they will learn how to find trustworthy people and how to stand unitedly for their demands. 
 Perhaps they may sometimessucceed in organising a strike, as the urban workers do. 
 True, this is more difficult in the countryside than in the towns, but it is sometimes possible for all that; in other countries there have been successful strikes, for instance, in the busy seasons, when the landlords and rich farmersare badly in need of hands. 
 If the rural poor are prepared tostrike, if an agreement has long been reached about thegeneral demands, if those demands have been explained inleaflets, or properly explained at meetings, all will stand together, and the landlord will have to yield, or at least put some curb on his greed. 
 If the strike is unanimous andis called during the busy season, the landlord, and even theauthorities with their troops, will find it hard to do any-thing—time will be lost, the landlord will be threatenedwith ruin, and he will soon become more tractable. 
 Of course, strikes are a new thing, and new things do not come off well at first. 
 The urban workers, too, did not know how tofight unitedly at first; they did not know what demands toput forward in common; they simply went out to smashmachinery and wreck a factory. 
 But now the workers havelearned to conduct a united struggle. 
 Every new job must first be learned. 
 The workers now understand that immedi-ate relief can be obtained only if they stand together; mean-while, the people are getting used to offering united resis-tance and are preparing more and more for the great and de-cisive struggle. 
 Similarly, the peasants will learn to standup to the worst robbers, to be united in their demands for some measure of relief and to prepare gradually, persistent-ly, and everywhere for the great battle for freedom. 
 The num-ber of class-conscious workers and peasants will constantlygrow, and the unions of rural Social-Democrats will becomestronger and stronger; every case of bondage to the land-lord, of extortion by the priest, of police brutality and bu-reaucratic oppression, will increasingly serve to open the eyes of the people, accustom them to putting up united re-sistance and to the idea that it is necessary to change thepolitical order by force. 
 At the very beginning of this pamphlet we said that at the present time the urban workers come out into the streets and squares and publicly demand freedom , that they inscribe on their banners and cry out: “Down with the autocracy!”The day will soon come when the urban workers will rise not merely to march shouting through the streets, but for the great and final struggle; when the workers will declare as one man: “We shall win freedom, or die in the fight!”; when the places of the hundreds who have been killed, fallen inthe fight will be taken by thousands of fresh and still moreresolute fighters. 
 And the peasants, too, will then rise allover Russia and go to the aid of the urban workers, willfight to the end for the freedom of the workers and peasants. 
 The tsar’s hordes will be unable to withstand that onslaught. 
 Victory will go to the working people, and the working classwill march along the wide, spacious road to the liberation ofall working people from any kind of oppression. 
 The workingclass will use its freedom to fight for socialism! THE PROGRAMME OF THE RUSSIAN SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC LABOUR PARTY PROPOSED BY THE NEWSPAPER ISKRA IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE MAGAZINE ZARYA We have already explained what a programme is, why one is needed, and why the Social-Democratic Party is the onlyparty that comes out with a clear and definite programme. 
A programme can be finally adopted only by the congressof our Party, i. 
e. 
, the assembly of representatives of all Party workers. 
 Preparations for such a congress are now being made by the Organising Committee. 
 But very many commit-tees of our Party have already openly declared their agree-ment with Iskra , and their recognition of Iskra as the lead-ing newspaper. 
 Therefore, prior to the congress our draft(proposed) programme can fully serve as a precise indication of what the Social-Democrats want, and we consider it nec-essary to give that draft in full as an appendix to our pam-phlet. 
 Of course, without an explanation not every worker will understand everything that is said in the programme. 
 Manygreat socialists worked to create the doctrine of Social-Democracy, which was completed by Marx and Engels; the workers of all countries went through a great deal to acquirethe experience that we want to utilise and make the basis of /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR our programme. 
 Therefore the workers must learn the teachings of Social-Democracy in order to understand every word of the programme, their programme, their banner of the struggle. 
 And the workers are learning and understandingthe Social-Democratic programme with particular easebecause that programme speaks of what every thinkingworker has seen and experienced. 
 Let nobody be deterredby the “difficulty” of understanding the programme all at once: the more every worker reads and thinks, the more ex-perience he acquires in the struggle, the more fully willhe understand it. 
 But let everybody think over and discussthe whole programme of the Social-Democrats; let everybody constantly keep in mind all that the Social-Democrats want , and what they think about the emancipation of all work-ing people. 
 The Social-Democrats want everybody to know clearly and precisely the truth, the whole truth, aboutwhat the Social-Democratic Party is. 
 We cannot here explain the whole programme in detail. 
 A separate pamphlet would be needed for that. 
 We shallmerely indicate briefly what the programme says, and advise the reader to get hold of two pamphlets to use as aids. 
 One pamphlet is by the German Social-Democrat Karl Kaut-sky, and its title is The Erfurt Programme . 
 It has been trans-lated into Russian. 
 The other pamphlet is by the RussianSocial-Democrat L. 
 Martov, and its title is The Workers ’ Cause in Russia . 
 These pamphlets will help the reader to understand the whole of our programme. 
 Let us now indicate each part of our programme by a separate letter (see the programme below) and show what isspoken about in each part. 
 A) At the very beginning it says that the proletariat all over the world is fighting for its emancipation, and the Russian proletariat is only a detachment in the world army of the working class of all countries. 
 B) It then goes on to explain the bourgeois order of things in nearly all countries in the world, including Russia: howthe majority of the population, working for the landown-ers and capitalists, live in poverty and want; how the small artisans and peasants are being ruined while the big facto-ries grow bigger; how capital crushes the worker and alsohis wife and children; how the conditions of the working class are growing worse and worse and unemployment and want are increasing. 
 C) It then speaks of the union of the workers, of their struggle, of the great aim of that struggle: to liberate allthe oppressed and completely abolish all oppression of thepoor by the rich. 
 This part also explains why the workingclass is growing stronger and stronger, and why it willcertainly defeat all its enemies, all those who defend the bourgeoisie. 
 D) Then it explains why Social-Democratic parties have been formed in all countries, how they help the workingclass to wage its struggle, unite and guide the workers, en-lighten them and prepare them for the great struggle. 
 E) Further, it explains why the conditions of the people in Russia are even worse than in other countries, what a great evil the tsarist autocracy is, and why we must first ofall overthrow that autocracy and establish popular, electivegovernment in Russia. 
 F) What improvements must elective government bring the whole people? We explain that in our pamphlet, and it is also explained in the programme. 
 G) Then the programme indicates what improvements for the whole of the working class we must strive to imme-diately achieve in order to make life easier for it and enableit to fight more freely for socialism. 
 H) Special reference is made in the programme to those improvements which we must first of all strive to achieve for all the peasants so as to enable the rural poor to wagethe class struggle more easily and freely against both therural bourgeoisie and the entire Russian bourgeoisie. 
 I) Lastly, the Social-Democratic Party warns the people not to believe any police or bureaucratic promises or honeyed words, but to fight firmly for the immediate con-vocation of a free national assembly of deputies. 
 LES BEAUX ESPRITS SE RENCONTRENT (WHICH MAY BE INTERPRETED ROUGHLY AS: BIRDS OF A FEATHER FLOCK TOGETHER) In June 1902 the much-vaunted minimum agrarian pro-gramme of our Socialist-Revolutionaries (co-operativesand socialisation) enriched Russian socialist thought andthe Russian revolutionary movement. 
 The German book, Socialism and Agriculture , by Eduard David, the well-known opportunist (and Bernsteinite), appeared in February 1903. 
There can evidently be no question of the consequent prod-uct of opportunist thought including the original of theearlier “Socialist-Revolutionary” mental gymnastics. 
 Ifthat is so, how is one to explain the amazing, the striking similarity and even the identity of principles in the pro-gramme of the Russian Socialist-Revolutionaries and thatof the German opportunists? Is it not perhaps a case ofRevolutsionnaya Rossiya being the “original”, while David’s “fundamental” (according to a review in Russkiye Vedomo-sti) work is the copy? Two basic ideas, and, correspondingly, two main points in the programme, run through the pattern of David’s “work”. 
 He glorifies agricultural co-operatives,expecting all possible blessings from them, demandingthat the Social-Democrats help develop them, and (justlike our Socialist-Revolutionaries) failing to see thebourgeois nature of these alliances between petty pro-prietors and agrarian capitalists, big and small. 
 David demands the conversion of large farms into small ones, andwaxes enthusiastic over the profitableness and efficiency,the thrifty management and productivity of the farms “ des Arbeitsbauern ”—literally, “of the working peasant”—em-phasising the society’s supreme right to landed property and the right of these same small “working peasants” to the use of the land. 
 Without any doubt, this German opportunist has plagiarised from the Russian “Socialist-Revolutionaries”! Of course neither the German petty-bourgeois opportunist northe Russian petty-bourgeois, the “Socialist-Revolutionaries”,see anything at all of the petty-bourgeois nature of the“working peasant” in present-day society, his intermediate,transitional position between the bourgeoisie and the pro-letariat, his ambition to “make his way in the world” (i. 
e. 
, become a full-fledged bourgeois) through frugality, dili-gence, semi-starvation, and excessive labour, and his striv-ing to exploit the labour of rural “workers”. 
 Yes, indeed, les beaux esprits se rencontrent , and herein lies the key to a puzzle which at first glance seems so diffi-cult: to determine which is the copy and which the original. 
 Ideas expressing the needs, interests, strivings, and aspira-tions of a certain class are in the very air, and their identitycannot be concealed by any differences of garb, by anyvariations of opportunist or “Socialist-Revolutionary” phrase-ology. 
 Murder will out. 
 In all the countries of Europe, Russia included, the petty bourgeoisie is steadily being “thrust to the wall” and fallinginto decline, a process which does not always express itselfin the outright and direct elimination of the petty bour-geoisie, but in most cases leads to a reduction of its role ineconomic life, to deterioration of its living conditions, and greater insecurity. 
 Everything militates against it: techni-cal progress in big industrial and agricultural enterprises,the development of the big shops, the growth of manufactur-ers’ associations, cartels and trusts, and even the growth ofconsumers’ societies and municipal enterprises. 
 And, whilethe petty bourgeoisie is being “thrust to the wall” in the sphere of agriculture and industry, a “new middle social-estate”, as the Germans say, is emerging and developing, anew stratum of the petty bourgeoisie, the intelligentsia, whoare also finding life in capitalist society harder and harderand for the most part regard this society from the viewpointof the small producer. 
 It is quite natural that this must inevitably lead to widespread dissemination and constant revival of petty-bourgeois ideas and doctrines in the mostvaried forms. 
 It is quite natural that the Russian “Socialist-Revolutionaries”, who are wholly in thrall to the ideas of petty-bourgeois Narodism, inevitably turn out to be “birds of a feather” with the European reformists and opportunists, who, when they would be consistent, inevitably arrive atProudhonism. 
 And this was the very term that Kautsky quitejustly used to describe David’s programme and stand-point. 
 We have said, “when they would be consistent”, and this brings us to an essential feature—one that distinguishes the present-day Socialist-Revolutionaries from both the oldRussian Narodniks and at least some of the European oppor-tunists—which can only be called adventurism. 
 Adventur-ism is not concerned with consistency, but endeavours tograsp at the fleeting opportunity and make use of the battle of ideas in order to justify and preserve its ideological pov-erty. 
 The old Russian Narodniks wanted to be consistentand they upheld, preached, and professed their own, distinctprogramme. 
 David wants to be consistent and rises up reso-lutely against the whole “Marxist agrarian theory”, emphat-ically preaches and professes the conversion of large farms into small farms, and, at least, has the courage of his con-victions, and is not afraid to come out openly as the championof small-scale farming. 
 Our Socialist-Revolutionariesare, to put it as mildly as possible, far more “prudent”. 
They never rise up resolutely against Marx—God forbid!On the contrary, they come forward with quotations plucked at random from Marx and Engels, assuring us with tears in their eyes that they agree with the latter almost in every-thing. 
 They do not come out against Liebknecht andKautsky—on the contrary, they are profoundly and sin-cerely convinced that Liebknecht was a Socialist-Revolution-ary—in very truth, a Socialist-Revolutionary. 
 They do not come forward as the champions of small-scale farming on principle—on the contrary, they are heart and soul forthe “socialisation of the land”, and it is only by accidentthat they sometimes blurt out that this all-embracing Rus-so-Dutch socialisation can mean anything and everything:either the transference of the land to society, to be used by the working people (exactly as David puts it!), or simply the transference of the land to the peasants, or, finally,quite “simply” the addition of plots of land gratis.... 
 Our Socialist-Revolutionaries’ “prudent” methods are so well known to us that we shall take the liberty, in conclusion, of giving them a piece of good advice. 
 You have obviously landed in a rather awkward situa-tion, gentlemen. 
 All along you have been assuring us that youhave nothing in common either with the opportunism andreformism in the West, or with the petty-bourgeois sympa-thies for the “profitable” small-scale farming—and suddenly a book by an avowed opportunist and champion of small-scale farming appears, in which your “Socialist-Revolution-ary” programme is “copied” with touching scrupulosity! Anawkward situation indeed. 
 But don’t let it distress you:there is an easy way out. 
 All you have to do is ... to quoteKautsky. 
 Nor should the reader think that this is a slip on our part. 
 Nothing of the sort. 
 Kautsky comes out against the Prou-dhonist David— for this very reason the Socialist-Revolu-tionaries, who are in agreement with David, have to quoteKautsky just as they once quoted Engels. 
 Take No. 
 14 ofRevolutsionnaya Rossiya and there you will read on page seven that the Social-Democrats’ “change of tactics” with regard to the peasantry “was legitimised” (!!) by one ofthe fathers of scientific socialism, by Engels—Engels, whotook up arms against the French comrades that had changedtheir tactics! How can one prove this pettifogging state-ment? Quite simply. 
 First, one must “quote” Engels’ words that he is absolutely on the side of the small peasant (and say nothing about the fact that this very thought isexpressed in the programme of the Russian Social-Democrats,which calls on all the working people to come over to theside of the proletariat!). 
 Secondly, one must say with regardto the “concessions to Bernsteinism” made by the French comrades who changed their tactics: “ See Engels ’ superb criticism of these concessions . 
” It is this selfsame tried meth-od that we advise the Socialist-Revolutionary gentlemento use now too. 
 David’s book has legitimised the change intactics on the agrarian question. 
 One cannot but admitnow that, with a programme of “co-operatives and socialisation”, it is possible to remain in the ranks of the Social-Democratic Party; only dogmatists and the orthodoxcan fail to see this. 
 But, on the other hand, it must be admit-ted that David, unlike the noble Socialist-Revolutionaries, makes some concessions to Bernsteinism. 
 “ See Kautsky ’s superb criticism of these concessions . 
” Indeed, gentlemen, try it. 
 Perhaps something will come of it once more. 
 Iskra , No. 
 38, April 15, 1903 Published according to the Iskra text REPLY TO CRITICISM OF OUR DRAFT PROGRAMME Comrade X127 rejects the third and fourth points of the agrarian section of our draft and submits his own draft, inwhich all the points of the agrarian programme, as well as the preamble to it, are revised. 
 We shall first examine Com-rade X’s objections to our draft, and then his own draft. 
 Against the third point, Comrade X advances the objec-tion that the confiscation of the monasterial (and we wouldwillingly add: church) estates and the royal demesnes asproposed by us would mean that the capitalists would grab the lands for next to nothing. 
 It would be precisely those who plunder the peasants, he says, who would buy upthese lands on the money they had plundered. 
 To this wemust remark that, in speaking about the sale of the confis-cated estates, Comrade X draws an arbitrary conclusion thatour programme does not contain. 
 Confiscation means aliena-tion of property without compensation. 
 It is only of such alienation that our draft speaks. 
 Our draft programme saysnothing as to whether these lands are to be sold, and if soto whom and how, in what manner and on what terms. 
 Weare not binding ourselves, but reserve judgement as to themost expedient form in which to dispose of the confiscated properties when they are confiscated, when all the social and political conditions of such confiscation are clear. 
 Inthis respect Comrade X’s draft differs from our draft indemanding, not only confiscation, but the transference ofthe confiscated lands “to the democratic state for theirmost advantageous utilisation by the population”. 
 Thus, Comrade X excludes one of the forms of the disposal of what has been confiscated (sale) and does not suggest any defi-nite form (since it remains unclear just what constitutes or will constitute or should constitute the “most advanta-geous” utilisation, and just what classes of the “population” will receive the right to this utilisation and on what terms). 
 Hence, Comrade X fails in any case to bring complete definite-ness into the question of how the confiscated lands shouldbe disposed of (nor can this be determined in advance), whilehe wrongly excludes their sale as one of the methods. 
 Itwould be wrong to say that, under all circumstances and at all times, the Social-Democrats will be opposed to the sale of the land. 
 In a police-controlled class state, even if it is aconstitutional state, the class of property-owners may notinfrequently be a far stauncher pillar of democracy than theclass of tenant farmers dependent on that state. 
 That is onthe one hand. 
 On the other hand, our draft makes for great-er provision than Comrade X’s draft does against confiscated lands being turned into “gifts to the capitalists” (insofar asany provision against this can be spoken of in general in thewording of a programme). 
 And indeed, let us imagine theworst: let us imagine that, despite all its efforts, the workers’party will be unable to curb the capitalists’ wilfulness and greed. 
 * In that case, Comrade X’s formulation affords free scope for the “most advantageous” utilisation of the confis-cated lands by the capitalist class of the “population”. 
 Onthe contrary, our formulation, while it does not link up thebasic demand with the form of its realisation, neverthelessenvisages a strictly definite application of sums received from such realisation. 
 When Comrade X says that “the Social-Democratic Party cannot undertake in advance todecide in what concrete form the popular representative bodywill utilise the land which it will have at its command”,he is confusing two different things: the method of realising (in other words: “the form of utilising”) this land and the application of the sums received from this realisation. 
 By leaving the question of the application of these-sums abso-lutely indefinite and tying his hands, even in part, in thequestion of the method of realisation, Comrade X intro-duces a double impairment into our draft. 
 In our opinion, Comrade X is just as wrong when he presents the following objection to us: “It is likewise impos-*And if we are able to curb them, then the sale of the land will not turn into plundering and gifts to the capitalists. 
 sible to recover land redemption payments from the nobles, since many of them have squandered them all. 
” As a matter of fact, this is no objection at all, since we do not even propose that these sums should simply be “recovered”, butpropose a special tax. 
 In his article Comrade X himselfcites facts showing that the big landowners “cut off” aparticularly large share of the peasants’ land for them-selves, in some cases seizing as much as three-quarters of the land. 
 Hence the demand for a special tax on the big landed nobility in particular is quite natural. 
 It is likewise quitenatural to designate funds thus obtained for the special usewe demand, for in addition to the general task of returning to the people all revenues received by the state (a task whichcan be fully accomplished only under socialism), liberated Russia will inescapably be faced with the special and most pressing task of raising the peasants’ standard of living,rendering serious aid to the poverty-stricken and hungrymasses, whose ranks are swelling so extremely rapidly underour autocratic system. 
 Let us pass to the fourth point, which Comrade X rejects in full, although he analyses only the first part of this point—about the cut-off lands—without any mentionof the second part, envisaging eradication of the remnantsof serfdom, which vary in different parts of the country. 
We shall begin with a formal remark by the author: he sees acontradiction in the fact that we demand abolition of the social-estates and the establishment of peasant, i. 
e. 
, social-estate, committees. 
 In fact, the contradiction is only aseeming one: the abolition of the social-estates requires a“dictatorship” of the lowest, oppressed social-estate, just asthe abolition of classes in general, including the class of pro-letarians, requires the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
 The object of our entire agrarian programme is the eradication of feudal and social-estate traditions in the sphere of agrar-ian relations, and to bring that about the only possibleappeal can be to the lowest social-estate, to those whoare oppressed by these remnants of the serf-owning sys-tem. 
 The author’s principal objection boils down to the follow-ing: “it is hardly provable” that the cut-off lands are theprincipal basis of the labour-rent system, since the size of these cut-off lands depended on whether the serf peasants were quit-rent peasants, and hence had much land, or cor-vée peasants, and hence had little land. 
 “The size of the cut-off lands and their importance depend on a combination ofhistorical conditions”; for instance, the percentage of cut-off lands is negligible on the small estates in Volsk Uyezd,while on the large estates it is enormous. 
 This is how theauthor reasons, without noticing that he is getting away from the point. 
 The cut-off lands were indubitably distributed most unevenly, depending on a combination of the mostvaried conditions (including a condition such as the existenceof the corvée system or quit-rent under the serf-owningsystem). 
 But what does that prove? Is not the labour-rentsystem also most unevenly distributed? Is not the existence of this system also determined by a combination of the most varied historical conditions? The author undertakes to dis-prove the connection between the cut-off lands and the labour-rent system, but talks only about the reasons for thecut-off lands and the differences in their size, without refer-ring by as much as a single word to this connection. 
 Only once does the author make an assertion which approaches immediately the substance of his thesis, and yet it is inthis very assertion that he is absolutely wrong . 
 “Consequent-ly,” he says, summing up his-arguments about the influenceof quit-rent or the corvée system, “where the peasants werecorvée peasants ( mainly in the central agricultural area ), these cut-off lands will be negligible , whereas in those places where they were quit-rent peasants, all of the landlords’ landmay consist of ‘cut-off lands’. 
” The words italicised by us con-tain a blunder which destroys the author’s whole line of ar-gument. 
 It is precisely in the central agricultural area, thismain centre of the labour-rent system and all sorts of remnants of serfdom, that the cut-off lands are not “negligible” but enormous, much greater than in the non-black-earth zone,where quit-rent predominates over corvée. 
 Here are dataon this question, received from a comrade who is a profes-sional statistician. 
 He has compared data given in the Mili-tary-Statistical Abstract on the holdings of landlords’ peasants prior to the Reform with the figures showing land holdings in 1878, thus determining the size of the cut-offlands in each gubernia. 
 It appeared that in nine gubernias of the non-black-earth zone * the landlords’ peasants held 10,421,000 dessiatines prior to the Reform, whereas only 9,746,000 dessiatines were left to them in 1878, i. 
e. 
, 675,000 dessiatines, or 6. 
5 per cent of the land, were cut off, theaverage per gubernia being 72,800 dessiatines. 
 On the otherhand, in fourteen black-earth gubernias ** the peasants held 12,795,000 dessiatines and were left with 9,996,000 des-siatines, i. 
e. 
, 2,799,000 dessiatines, or 21. 
9 per cent, were cut off, an average of 199,100 dessiatines per gubernia. 
 The only exception was the third area, in the steppes, where infive gubernias *** the peasants held 2,203,000 dessiatines and they were left with 1,580,000, i. 
e. 
, 623,000, or 28. 
3per cent, were cut off, the average per gubernia being 124,600dessiatines. 
 **** This area is an exception, since here the capi-talist system predominates over the labour-rent system, while the percentage of cut-off lands is the highest here. 
 But thisexception only goes to prove the general rule, for here theinfluence of the cut-off lands has been paralysed by such im-portant circumstances as the peasants possessing the largestallotments, despite the cut-off lands, and the greatest amount of free land available here for renting. 
 Thus, the author’s attempt to cast doubt on the existence of a connection be-tween the cut-off lands and the labour-rent system is quiteunsuccessful. 
 On the whole , there is no doubt that the centre of the labour-rent system in Russia (the central black-earth *Pskov, Novgorod, Tver, Moscow, Vladimir, Smolensk, Kaluga, Yaroslavl, and Kostroma gubernias. 
 **Orel, Tula, Ryazan, Kursk, Voronezh, Tambov, Nizhni-Novgorod, Simbirsk, Kazan, Penza, Saratov, Chernigov, Kharkov,and Poltava gubernias (37 per cent of the land cut off). 
 *** Kherson, Ekaterinoslav, Taurida, Don (approximate figure), and Samara gubernias. 
 **** Comparing these figures on the cut-off lands in three areas with the figures on the proportion of corvée peasants to the totalnumber of peasants (according to the data of the Drafting Commis-sions: see Vol. 
 32, p. 
 686 of the Encyclopaedic Dictionary , the article “The Peasants”), we get the following relationship. 
 Non-black-eartharea (9 gubernias): cut-off lands—6. 
5 per cent; corvée peasants—43. 
9per cent (average for 9 gubernias). 
 Central black-earth area (14 guber-nias): cut-off lands—21. 
9 per cent, corvée peasants—76 per cent. 
Steppe area (5 gubernias): cut-off lands—28. 
3 per cent; corvée peas-ants—95. 
3 per cent. 
 Hence the relationship is just the opposite towhat Comrade X wants to make out. 
 area) is at the same time the centre of the cut-off lands. 
 We emphasise “on the whole” in reply to the following question put by the author. 
 Against the words in our programme about restitution of land which has been cut off and is now used as ameans of bondage, the author has put in brackets the follow-ing question: “but what about that which is not used assuch?” Our reply to him is that the programme is not alegislative bill on the restitution of the cut-off lands. 
 We define and explain the general significance of the cut-off lands, but do not speak of individual cases. 
 Is it really still pos-sible, after all the Narodnik literature on the position of thepost-Reform peasantry, to have any doubts about the factthat on the whole the cut-off lands serve as a means of serfbondage? Is it really possible, we ask further, to deny the connection between the cut-off lands and the labour-rent system, when this connection follows from the most element-ary concepts on the post-Reform economy of Russia? Thelabour-rent system is a combination of the corvée system andcapitalism, of the “old regime” and “modern” economy, ofthe system of exploitation through land allotment and the system of exploitation through separation from the land. 
 What could be a more glaring example of present-day corvéethan a system of farming based on labour rendered in returnfor the use of cut-off lands (a system described as such , as a special system, and not something incidental, in Narodnikliterature in the good old days, when nobody had even heard of the hackneyed and narrow-minded Marxists)? Is it really possible to believe that today the peasant is tied down tothe land only because there is no law granting freedom of movement, and not because of the existence, in addition tothat ( and partly at the root of that ), of bondage service for the use of the cut-off lands? After failing to prove in any way that there is any basis for his doubting the existence of a connection between thecut-off lands and bondage, the author continues his argumentas follows: restitution of the cut-off lands is the allottingof small plots of land based not so much on the requirementsof peasant farming as on historical “tradition”. 
 Like any allotment of an insufficient quantity of land (there can be no question of an adequate allotment), it will not destroy bond-age but will rather create it, since it will cause renting of land that is lacking, renting because of need, subsistence tenancy, and will consequently be a reactionary measure. 
 Here too the argument misses the mark, for the agrarian section of our programme does not at all “promise” to do awaywith all want in general (this promise is given only in thegeneral socialist section of the programme), but promisesonly to eradicate (at least in part) the remnants of the serf-owning system. 
 Our programme refers, not to allotment of all sorts of small plots of land in general, but specifically to doing away with at least one of the already existing formsof bondage. 
 The author has departed from the trend ofthought underlying our programme, and arbitrarily andincorrectly attributed another meaning to it. 
 Indeed, justexamine his line of reasoning. 
 He rejects (and in this respect, he is of course right) the interpretation of cut-off lands as implying just strips of land belonging to different owners,and says: “If the cut-off lands are to constitute additionalallotment land, it is necessary to see whether there areenough cut-off lands to remove relationships entailing bond-age, since from this standpoint bondage relationships are a result of land-hunger. 
” Absolutely nowhere in our pro-gramme is the assertion made that there are enough cut-offlands to do away with bondage. 
 Only the socialist revolu-tion can do away with all bondage, whereas in the agrarianprogramme we take our stand on the ground of bourgeoisrelationships and demand certain measures “with a view to eradicating” (we do not even say that this can be complete eradication) the remnants of the serf-owning system. 
 Thewhole essence of our agrarian programme is that the ruralproletariat must fight together with the rich peasantry forthe abolition of the remnants of serfdom, for the cut-off lands. 
Anyone who examines this proposition closely will grasp the incorrectness, the irrelevance and illogicality of an objec-tion such as: why only the cut-off lands, if that is not enough? Because together with the rich peasantry the proletariat will be unable to go, and must not go , beyond the abolition of serf-dom, beyond restitution of the cut-off lands, etc. 
 Beyond that , the proletariat in general and the rural proletariat in particular will march alone ; not together with the “peasant-ry”, not together with the rich peasant, but against him . 
 The reason we do not go beyond the demand for the cut-off lands is not because we do not wish the peasant well or because we are afraid of scaring the bourgeoisie, but be-cause we do not want the rural proletarian to help the rich peasant more than is necessary , more than is essential to the proletariat. 
 Both the proletarian and the rich peasant sufferfrom serf bondage; against this bondage they can and should go together; but against the other forms of bondage, the pro-letariat will go alone. 
 Hence the distinction made in our programme between serf bondage and all other bondage nec-essarily follows from the strict observance of the class in-terests of the proletariat . 
 We would be running counter to these interests and would be abandoning the class standpointof the proletariat, if we allowed our programme to state thatthe “peasantry” (i. 
e. 
, the rich plus the poor) will go togeth-er beyond eradication of the remnants of serfdom; we would thereby be putting a brake on this absolutely essen-tial, and, from the standpoint of the Social-Democrat, themost important, process of the final separation of the rural proletariat from the land-holding peasantry, the process of the development of proletarian class-consciousness in the countryside. 
 When the Narodniks, people of the old faith, and the Socialist-Revolutionaries, people without faith orconvictions of any kind, shrug their shoulders at our agrar-ian programme, that is because they (for instance, Mr. 
Rudin and Co. 
) have no idea of the real economic system inour countryside and its evolution, have no idea of the bour-geois relations which have been developing and have almost taken shape within the village commune, or of the strengthof the bourgeois peasantry. 
 They approach our agrarianprogramme with the old Narodnik prejudices, or more fre-quently with fragments of these prejudices, and begin tocriticise individual points or their wording, without even comprehending the aim of our agrarian programme or the social and economic relations it has in view. 
 When they aretold that our agrarian programme does not refer to the strug-gle against the bourgeois system, but to the evolution of bour-geois relations in the countryside, they merely rub their eyesin amazement, unaware (because of their characteristic indif-ference to theory) that their perplexity is simply an echo of the struggle between the Narodnik and the Marxist worldoutlook. 
 To the Marxist who undertakes to draft an agrarian programme, the question of the remnants of serfdom in the bourgeois and capitalistically developing Russian country-side is one that has already been settled, and it is only owingto their utter lack of principle that the Socialist-Revolution-aries are unable to see that if they want to offer any material criticism they must contrapose to our solution of this ques-tion something that is at least coherent and integral. 
 To the Marxist the problem is simply to avoid either of two ex-tremes: on the one hand, not to fall into the error of thosewho say that, from the standpoint of the proletariat, we arein no way concerned with any immediate and temporarynon-proletarian tasks, and on the other, not to allow theproletariat’s co-operation in the attainment of the immedi-ate democratic tasks to dim its class-consciousness and its class distinctiveness. 
 In the sphere of agrarian relationshipsproper, this task reduces itself to the following: the bringingforward of a slogan of such an agrarian reform on the basis ofthe existing society as would most completely sweep away theremnants of serfdom and most rapidly single out the rural proletariat from the undifferentiated mass of the peasantry as a whole. 
 We believe that our programme has coped with this task. 
 Moreover, we are not at all put out by Comrade X’s question:what should we do if the peasant committees demand not thecut-off lands but all the land? We ourselves demand all the land, only, of course, not “with a view to eradicating the remnants of the serf-owning system” (to which end theagrarian section of our programme limits itself), but with a view to the socialist revolution. 
 And it is precisely thisgoal that we are always and under all circumstances tireless-ly pointing out to the “rural poor”. 
 There is no grosser error than to think that the Social-Democrat can go to the villages only with the agrarian section of his programme, that he caneven for a moment furl his socialist banner. 
 If the demandfor all the land is a demand for the nationalisation of theland or its transference to the land-holding peasants of today,we shall appraise this demand from the standpoint of the proletariat’s interests, taking all factors into consideration: we cannot, for instance, say in advance whether, when therevolution awakens them to political life, our land-holding peasants will come out as a democratic revolutionary party or as a party of Order. 
 We must draft our programme so as to be prepared even for the worst, and if the best combinations ensue, then that will only facilitate our work and give ita new stimulus. 
 It remains for us to deal with the following argument by Comrade X on the question under discussion. 
 “To this,” hewrites concerning his thesis that the allotment of the cut-off lands will strengthen subsistence farming tenancy, “to this, exception might be taken on the ground that theallotment of the cut-off lands is important as a means ofabolishing bondage forms of renting these lands, and not as a means of increasing and strengthening small subsis-tence farming. 
 However, it is easy to see that there is a logical contradiction in this objection. 
 The allotment of small plots of land is the allotment of land in insufficient quantity for the conduct of progressive farming but sufficient tostrengthen subsistence farming. 
 Hence, subsistence farm-ing is strengthened by the allotment of an insufficientquantity of land. 
 But as to whether bondage forms of renting will be abolished by this—that still remains to be proved. 
 We have shown that they will become stronger be-cause of the increase in the number of petty proprietors—competitors in renting the landlord’s land. 
” We have quoted this argument of Comrade X’s in full so as to make it easier for the reader to judge where the “logical contradiction” actually lies. 
 As a general rule the peasants are at present using the cut-off lands on terms of serf bondage. 
Upon the restitution of the cut-off lands, the peasants willuse them as free owners. 
 Does it really “still remain to beproved” that this restitution will abolish the serf bondage resulting from these cut-off lands? It is a matter of special plots of land that have already given rise to a special form of bond-age, but the author substitutes for this particular conceptthe general category of “an insufficient quantity of land”!This means skipping the question. 
 It means assuming thatat present the cut-off lands do not engender any special formof bondage: in which case their restitution would really be simply the “allotment of an insufficient quantity of land”, and then we would really be unable to support this measure. 
But it is perfectly obvious to everyone that this is not the case. 
 Further. 
 The author should not confuse serf bondage (the labour-rent system of farming) engendered by the cut-off lands with subsistence farming tenancy, with renting as a re-sult of need in general. 
 The latter form of renting existsin all European countries: under the capitalist system offarming, the competition of petty proprietors and small ten-ants everywhere and always inflates land prices and land rent to the proportions of “bondage”. 
 We cannot do away with this kind of bondage * until we get rid of capitalism. 
 But can this be regarded as an objection to particular meas-ures of struggle against particular and purely Russian formsof bondage? Comrade X reasons as though he objected to areduction of the working day on the grounds that the inten-sity of labour would be increased as a result of this reduc-tion. 
 The reduction of the working day is a partial reform, which eradicates only one form of bondage, viz. 
, enslavementby means of longer working hours. 
 Other forms of bondage, as,for instance, “speeding up” the workers, are not eliminatedby this reform, and all forms of bondage in general cannot be eradicated by any reforms on the basis of capitalism. 
 When the author says: “Allotment of the cut-off lands is a reactionary measure, which reinforces bondage,” he is advanc-ing a proposition which stands in such glaring contradiction toall the data on post-Reform peasant farming that he himselfis unable to maintain this stand. 
 He contradicts himselfwhen he says somewhat earlier: “...It goes without saying that it is not the business of the Social-Democratic Party to implant capitalism. 
 This will take place irrespective ofthe desire of any party, if peasant tenure extends.... 
” But ifthe extension of peasant tenure in general leads to the de-velopment of capitalism, how much the more inevitably will this result from the extension of peasant land ownership to the special plots of land which engender a specifically serf form of bondage. 
 The restitution of the cut-off landswill raise the peasants’ standard of living, expand the homemarket, increase the demand for wage-workers in the towns,and likewise the demand for wage-labourers among therich peasants and landlords, who lose a certain mainstay of the labour-rent system of farming. 
 As to the “ implant-*This bondage may be limited, kept in check, by empowering the courts to reduce rents—a demand we advance in our programme. 
 ing of capitalism”, that is an altogether queer objection. 
 The restitution of the cut-off lands would signify the implanting of capitalism only were that restitution necessary and advan-tageous solely to the bourgeoisie. 
 But that is not the case. 
 It is no less, if not more, necessary and advantageous tothe rural poor, who are suffering from bondage and the la-bour-rent system. 
 The rural proletarian is oppressed together with the rural bourgeois by serf bondage, which is based to a considerable degree on these very cut-off lands. 
 That is why the rural proletarian cannot emancipate himself from thisbondage without thereby emancipating the rural bourgeois too. 
 Only Messrs. 
 the Rudins and similar Socialist-Revolu-tionaries, who have forgotten their kinship with the Narod-niks, can see in this an “implanting” of capitalism. 
 Still less convincing are Comrade X’s arguments on the question of the feasibility of restituting the cut-off lands. 
The Volsk Uyezd data he cites speak against him: almostone-fifth of the estates (18 out of 99) have remained in thehands of the old proprietors, i. 
e. 
, the cut-off lands could betransferred to the peasants directly and without any redemp-tion. 
 Another third of the estates have changed hands entirely, i. 
e. 
, here it would be necessary to redeem the cut-offlands at the expense of the big landed nobility. 
 And only in16 cases out of 99 would it be necessary to redeem land frompeasants and other owners who purchased it in portions. 
 Wesimply cannot understand how the restitution of the cut-off lands can be “unfeasible” under such circumstances. 
 Let us take the data referring to the selfsame Saratov Gubernia. 
 Wehave before us the latest “Materials on the Question of theNeeds of the Agricultural Industries in Saratov Gubernia”(Saratov, 1903). 
 The size of all the cut-off lands held by for-mer landlords’ peasants is given as 600,000 dessiatines, or 42. 
7 per cent. 
 * If in 1896 the Zemstvo statisticians could de-termine the size of the cut-off lands on the basis of extracts *These latest Zemstvo statistics, we might note, fully bear out the contention of the aforementioned statistician that the data hesubmitted on the cut-off lands are an underestimation . 
 According to those data the cut-off lands in Saratov Gubernia amounted only to512,000 dessiatines ( =38 per cent). 
 As a matter of fact, even 600,000 dessiatines is below the actual size of the cut-off lands , for in the first place, it does not include all the village communes of the former landlords’ peasants, and, secondly, it covers only cultivable lands . 
 from the title-deeds and other documents, why can their size not be determined even more accurately by the peasant committees in, say, 1906? And if the figures for Volsk Uyezd are taken as a standard, then it would appear that approxi-mately 120,000 dessiatines could be returned to the peasantsat once and without any redemption, that about 200,000 des-siatines could be redeemed at once (at the expense of thenoblemen’s land) from estates which changed hands in their entirety, and that only with regard to the remaining land would the process of redemption (at the expense of the landednobility), exchange, etc. 
, be somewhat more compli-cated but in any case by no means “unfeasible”. 
 The sig-nificance the restitution of their 600,000 dessiatines of landwould have for the peasants is, for example, evident fromthe fact that the total amount of privately owned land rented in Saratov Gubernia at the end of the nineties wasapproximately 900,000 dessiatines. 
 Naturally, we do not intend to assert that all cut-off lands are being rented at the present time; we merely want to show graphically theproportion of the amount of land to be returned as property, to the amount of land which is now being rented very often on terms entailing bondage and serf bondage. 
 This comparisontestifies most eloquently to the force of the blow which the restitution of the cut-off lands would deal at relations entailing serf bondage, to the stimulus it would give to therevolutionary energy of the “peasantry” and—what is most important from the viewpoint of the Social-Democrat—to the tremendous impetus it would give to the ideologicaland political cleavage between the rural proletariat and the peasant bourgeoisie. 
 For the peasant committees’ work of expropriation would immediately and inevitably bringabout just such a decided and irrevocable cleavage, and by no means a union of the entire “peasantry” for “semi-socialist” “equalitarian” demands for all the land, as the modernepigones of Narodism fondly imagine. 
 The more revo-lutionary the action of the “peasantry ” against the landlords, the more rapid and deep will this cleavage be, which willthen be made manifest not by the statistical computations of Marxist research but by the political action of the peasant bourgeoisie, by the struggle of parties and classes withinthe peasant committees. 
 And note: by advancing the demand for the restitution of the cut-off lands we are deliberately confining our task to the framework of the existing order; we are obliged to do this if we are to speak of a minimum programme and if wedo not want to lapse into that kind of barefaced scheme-mak-ing, verging on charlatanry, in which “first place” is givento co-operatives, on the one hand, and to socialisation, on theother. 
 We are replying to a question that has been raised but not by us, * to the question of the reforms of tomorrow, which are being discussed by the illegal press, “society”, bythe Zemstvos, and, perhaps, even by the government. 
 Wewould be anarchists or simply windbags if we held our-selves aloof from this pressing, but by no means socialist,problem which has been raised by the entire post-Reform *To what extent the question of agrarian reforms on the basis of the existing order has been raised “not by us” is evident, for exam-ple, from the following quotation which we have taken from an articleby Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
, one of the most prominent theoreticians of Narodism, which dates back to the best period of his activity ( Otechestvenniye Zapiski , 128 1882, Nos. 
 8 and 9). 
 “The order which we are analysing,” Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
 wrote at the time about our system of agriculture, “has been inherited by us from the serf-owning system.... 
 Serfdom hascollapsed but so far only in its juridical aspect and a few others; thesystem of agriculture, however, has remained the same as it was priorto the Reform.... 
 The peasants were unable to continue running theirfarms solely on their own curtailed allotments; they absolutely had to use the lands that had been taken from them.... 
 In order to secure the proper running of the small farms, it is necessary to guarantee thepeasant the use of at least those lands that ... in one way or anotherwere at his disposal at the time of serfdom. 
 This is the minimum desi-deratum that can be advanced on behalf of small scale farming. 
”This is how the question was put by those who believed in Narodism and openly preached it, instead of unseemingly playing at hide-and-seek as the Socialist-Revolutionary gentlemen do. 
 And Social-Democ-racy has appraised this Narodnik presentation in its essence, as italways appraises bourgeois and petty-bourgeois demands. 
 It tookover in full the positive and progressive side of the demands (thestruggle against all remnants of serfdom), rejecting petty-bourgeois illusions and pointing out that the eradication of the remnants of the serf-owning system will clear the road for, and speed up, capitalistdevelopment and not any other kind. 
 It is precisely in the interestsof social development and of untying the proletarian’s hands, andnot “for the sake of small-scale farming” that we present our demandfor the restitution of the cut-off lands, while by no means pledging ourselves to assist the “small” peasant bourgeoisie either against serf-dom or even against the big bourgeoisie. 
 history of Russia. 
 We must provide a correct solution, from the Social-Democratic standpoint, to this problem which has not been raised by us; we must define our position with re-gard to the agrarian reforms which all liberal society has already demanded and without which no reasonable person can imagine the political emancipation of Russia. 
 And wedefine our stand on this liberal reform (liberal in the scientific, that is the Marxist, sense of the word), while remaining wholly true to our principle of support for the genuinelydemocratic movement, coupled with steady and persistent work to develop the class-consciousness of the proletariat. 
 We lay down a practical line of conduct with regard to thiskind of reform, which the government or the liberals must very soon adopt. 
 We advance a slogan that impels towards a revolutionary issue a reform which has actually been prompt-ed by life itself and not concocted from the fantasy of a hazy, humanitarian Allerwelts * socialism. 
 It is in this latter respect that the draft programme of Comrade X is in error. 
 No answer whatever is given to the question of the attitude to be taken towards the forthcoming liberal reforms in agrarian relationships. 
 Instead, we are of-fered (in points 5 and 7) an inferior and contradictory formu-lation of the demand for the nationalisation of the land. 
 Contradictory, because the abolition of rent is at one timeproposed by means of a tax, at another by means of trans-ferring the land to society; inferior, because rents cannot be abolished by taxes, and because the land should (generallyspeaking) preferably be transferred to a democratic state, and not to small public organisations (like the present or future Zemstvos). 
 The reasons for non-inclusion in our programmeof the demand for the nationalisation of the land have al-ready been given more than once, and we shall not repeat them here. 
 Point 8 does not at all bear upon the practical section of the programme, while Point 6 has been formulated by Com-rade X in such a way as to have nothing “agrarian” left in it. 
Why he deletes the point on the courts and reduction of rents remains a mystery. 
 *Acceptable to all. 
— Ed. 
 The author formulates Point 1 less clearly than is done in our draft, while his addition: “in the interests of defend-ing the petty proprietor (and not of developing petty pro-prietorship),” is once again non-“agrarian”, inaccurate (we are not out to defend petty proprietors who employ wage-labour) and superfluous, for, inasmuch as we defend theperson and not the property of the petty bourgeois, we do this through our demand for strictly defined social, finan-cial, and other reforms. 
 Written in June 1903 First printed in July 1903 Published according in a pamphlet published by the League to the text in the of Russian Social-Democracy Abroad pamphlet THE NATIONAL QUESTION IN OUR PROGRAMME In our draft Party programme we have advanced the demand for a republic with a democratic constitution thatwould guarantee, among other things, “recognition of the right to self-determination for all nations forming part of the state”. 
 Many did not find this demand in our pro-gramme sufficiently clear, and in issue No. 
 33, in speakingabout the Manifesto of the Armenian Social-Democrats, weexplained the meaning of this point in the following way. 
The Social-Democrats will always combat every attempt to influence national self-determination from without by vio-lence or by any injustice. 
 However, our unreserved recogni-tion of the struggle for freedom of self-determination doesnot in any way commit us to supporting every demand fornational self-determination. 
 As the party of the proletariat,the Social-Democratic Party considers it to be its positive and principal task to further the self-determination of the proletariat in each nationality rather than that of peoplesor nations. 
 We must always and unreservedly work for thevery closest unity of the proletariat of all nationalities, and it is only in isolated and exceptional cases that we can ad-vance and actively support demands conducive to the establishment of a new class state or to the substitution of a looser federal unity, etc. 
, for the complete political unityof a state. 
 * This explanation of our programme on the national question has evoked a strong protest from the Polish Social-ist Party (P. 
S. 
P. 
).

 tion” ( Przed 9wit,* March 1903), the P. 
S. 
P. 
 expresses indigna-tion at this “amazing” explanation and at the “vagueness” of this “mysterious” self-determination of ours; it accuses us both of doctrinairism and of holding the “anarchist” viewthat “the worker is concerned with nothing but the completeabolition of capitalism, since, we learn, language, national-ity, culture, and the like are mere bourgeois inventions”,and so on. 
 It is worth considering this argument in detail, for it reveals almost all the misconceptions in the national question so common and so widespread among socialists. 
 What makes our explanation so “amazing”? Why is it considered a departure from the “literal” meaning? Does rec-ognition of the right of nations to self-determination really imply support of any demand of every nation for self-deter-mination? After all, the fact that we recognise the right of all citizens to form free associations does not at all commitus, Social-Democrats, to supporting the formation of any new association; nor does it prevent us from opposing and cam-paigning against the formation of a given association as aninexpedient and unwise step. 
 We even recognise the right of the Jesuits to carry on agitation freely, but we fight (not by police methods, of course) against an alliance between theJesuits and the proletarians. 
 Consequently, when the Przed-9wit says: “If this demand for the right to free self-determination is to be taken literally [and that is howwe have taken it hitherto], then it would satisfy us”—it is quite obvious that it is precisely the P. 
S. 
P. 
 that is departing from the literal meaning of the programme. 
 Its conclusion is cer-tainly illogical from the formal point of view. 
 We do not, however, wish to confine ourselves to a formal verification of our explanation. 
 We shall go straight tothe root of the matter: is Social-Democracy in duty bound to demand national independence always and unreservedly, or only under certain circumstances; if the latter is the casethen under what circumstances? To this question the P. 
S. 
P. 
has always replied in favour of unreserved recognition; weare not in the least surprised, therefore, at the fondness itdisplays towards the Russian Socialist-Revolutionaries, who *Dawn. 
— Ed. 
 demand a federal state system and speak in favour of “com-plete and unreserved recognition of the right to national self-determination” ( Revolutsionnaya Rossiya , No. 
 18, the article entitled “National Enslavement and RevolutionarySocialism”). 
 Unfortunately, this is nothing more than oneof those bourgeois-democratic phrases which, for thehundredth and thousandth time, reveal the true natureof the so-called Party of so-called Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
 By falling for the bait presented by these phrases and yield-ing to the allurement of this clamour, the P. 
S. 
P. 
 in its turnproves how weak in theoretical background and politicalactivities is its link with the class struggle of the proletar-iat. 
 But it is to the interests of this struggle that we mustsubordinate the demand for national self-determination. 
 It is this that makes all the difference between our approach to the national question and the bourgeois-democraticapproach. 
 The bourgeois democrat (and the present-day soci-alist opportunist who follows in his footsteps) imagines thatdemocracy eliminates the class struggle, and that is why hepresents all his political demands in an abstract way, lumped together, “without reservations”, from the standpoint of the interests of the “whole people”, or even from that of aneternal and absolute moral principle. 
 Always and every-where the Social-Democrat ruthlessly exposes this bourgeoisillusion, whether it finds expression in an abstract idealistphilosophy or in an absolute demand for national indepen-dence. 
 If there is still need to prove that a Marxist can recog-nise the demand for national independence only conditional-ly, namely, on the condition indicated above, let us quote awriter who defended from the Marxist viewpoint the Polish proletarians’ demand for an independent Poland. 
 In 1896 Karl Kautsky wrote in an article entitled “Finis Poloniae?” *: “Once the proletariat tackles the Polish question it cannotbut take a stand in favour of Poland’s independence, and,consequently, it cannot but welcome each step that can betaken in this direction at the present time, insofar as thisstep is at all compatible with the class interests of the international militant proletariat. 
” *“The End of Poland?”— Ed. 
 “This reservation,” Kautsky goes on to say, “should be made in any case. 
 National independence is not so insepa-rably linked with the class interests of the militant proletariat as to make it necessary to strive for it unconditionally , under any circumstances . 
* Marx and Engels took a most deter-mined stand in favour of the unification and liberation ofItaly, but this did not prevent them from coming outin 1859 against an Italy allied with Napoleon. 
” ( Neue Zeit , XIV, 2, S. 
 520. 
) As you see, Kautsky categorically rejects the unconditional demand for the independence of nations, and categoricallydemands that the question be placed not merely on a histor-ical basis in general, but specifically on a class basis. 
 Andif we examine how Marx and Engels treated the Polish question, we shall see that this was precisely their approach to it from the very outset. 
 Die Neue Rheinische Zeitung 130 devoted much space to the Polish question, and emphatically demanded, not only the independence of Poland, but alsothat Germany go to war with Russia for Poland’s freedom. 
At the same time Marx, however, attacked Ruge, who had spoken in favour of Poland’s freedom in the Frankfort Parliament and had tried to settle the Polish questionsolely by means of bourgeois-democratic phrases about“shameful injustice”, without making any attempt to analyseit historically. 
 Marx was not like those pedants and phil-istines of the revolution who dread nothing more than “polemics” at revolutionary moments in history. 
 Marx poured pitiless scorn on the “humane” citizen Ruge, andshowed him, from the example of the oppression of the southof France by the north of France, that it is not every kind ofnational oppression that invariably inspires a desire forindependence which is justified from the viewpoint of democracy and the proletariat. 
 Marx referred to special social circumstances as a result of which “Poland ... becamethe revolutionary part of Russia, Austria, and Prussia.... 
Even the Polish nobility, although their foundations werestill partly feudal, adhered to the democratic agrarian rev-olution with unparalleled selflessness. 
 Poland was already a seat of East-European democracy at a time when Ger-*Italics ours. 
 many was still groping her way through the most platitudi-nous constitutional and high-flown philosophical ideology.... 
 So long as we [Germans] ... help to oppress Poland, so long as we keep part of Poland fettered to Germany, we shallremain fettered to Russia and Russian policy, we shall beunable completely to smash patriarchal feudal absolutismat home. 
 The creation of a democratic Poland is the primaryprerequisite of the creation of a democratic Germany. 
 131 We have quoted these statements in such detail because they graphically show the historical background at a timewhen the attitude of international Social-Democracy to thePolish problem took shape in a way which held good almostthroughout the second half of the nineteenth century. 
 Toignore the changes which have taken place in that back-ground and to continue advocating the old solutions given by Marxism, would mean being true to the letter but not tothe spirit of the teaching, would mean repeating the old con-clusions by rote, without being able to use the Marxist meth-od of research to analyse the new political situation. 
 Thosetimes and today—the age of the last bourgeois revolutionary movements, and the age of desperate reaction, extreme ten-sion of all forces on the eve of the proletarian revolution—differ in the most obvious way. 
 In those times Poland as a whole, not only the peasantry, but even the bulk of the no-bility, was revolutionary. 
 The traditions of the strugglefor national liberation were so strong and deep-rooted that, after their defeat at home, Poland’s best sons went wher-ever they could find a revolutionary class to support; thememory of Dabrowski and of Wróblewski 132 is inseparably associated with the greatest movement of the proletariatin the nineteenth century, with the last—and let us hopethe last unsuccessful—insurrection of the Paris workers. 
 In those times complete victory for democracy in Europe was indeed impossible without the restoration of Poland. 
In those times Poland was indeed the bulwark of civilisa-tion against tsarism, and the vanguard of democracy. 
 To-day the Polish ruling classes, the gentry in Germany and in Austria, and the industrial and financial magnates in Rus-sia are supporting the ruling classes of the countries that oppress Poland, while the German and the Russian proletar-iat are fighting for freedom side by side with the Polish proletariat, which has heroically taken over the great tra-ditions of the old revolutionary Poland. 
 Today the ad-vanced representatives of Marxism in the neighbouring coun-try, while attentively watching the political evolutionof Europe and fully sympathising with the heroic struggleof the Poles, nevertheless frankly admit that “at present St. 
Petersburg has become a much more important revolution-ary centre than Warsaw, and the Russian revolutionary movement is already of greater international significance than the Polish movement”. 
 This is what Kautsky wrote asearly as 1896, in defending the inclusion in the Polish Social-Democrats’ programme of the demand for Poland’s restora-tion. 
 And in 1902 Mehring, who has been studying the evo-lution of the Polish question since 1848, arrived at the fol-lowing conclusion: “Had the Polish proletariat desired to inscribe on its banner the restoration of a Polish class state,which the ruling classes themselves do not want to hearof, it would be playing a historical farce; this may wellhappen to the propertied classes (as, for instance, the Polishnobility in 1791), but it should never happen to the working class. 
 If, on the other hand, this reactionary Utopia comes out to win over to proletarian agitation those sections of the in-telligentsia and of the petty bourgeoisie which still respondin some measure to national agitation, then that Utopia isdoubly untenable as an outgrowth of that unworthy oppor-tunism which sacrifices the long-term interests of the working class to the cheap and paltry successes of the moment. 
 “Those interests dictate categorically that, in all three states that have partitioned Poland, the Polish workers shouldfight unreservedly side by side with their class comrades. 
The times are past when a bourgeois revolution could createa free Poland: today the renascence of Poland is possible only through a social revolution, in the course of which the modern proletariat will break its chains. 
” 133 We fully subscribe to Mehring’s conclusion. 
 We shall only remark that this conclusion remains unassailable evenif we do not go as far as Mehring in our arguments. 
 With-out any doubt the present state of the Polish question differs radically from that which obtained fifty years ago. 
 How-ever, the present situation cannot be regarded as perma-nent. 
 Class antagonism has now undoubtedly relegated na-tional questions far into the background, but, without the risk of lapsing into doctrinairism, it cannot be categorically asserted that some particular national question cannot appear temporarily in the foreground of the political drama. 
 Nodoubt, the restoration of Poland prior to the fall of capital-ism is highly improbable, but it cannot be asserted thatit is absolutely impossible, or that circumstances may notarise under which the Polish bourgeoisie will take the side of independence, etc. 
 And Russian Social-Democracy does not in the least intend to tie its own hands. 
 In including inits programme recognition of the right of nations to self-determination, it takes into account all possible, and even all conceivable , combinations. 
 That programme in no way precludes the adoption by the Polish proletariat of the slo-gan of a free and independent Polish republic, even though the probability of its becoming a reality before socialism isintroduced is infinitesimal. 
 The programme merely demandsthat a genuinely socialist party shall not corrupt proletar-ian class-consciousness, or slur over the class struggle, orlure working class with bourgeois-democratic phrases, or break the unity of the proletariat’s present-day political struggle. 
 This reservation is the crux of the matter, for onlywith this reservation do we recognise self-determination. 
It is useless for the P. 
S. 
P. 
 to pretend that it differs from theGerman or Russian Social-Democrats in their rejection of theright to self-determination, the right to strive for a free and independent republic. 
 It is not this, but the fact that it loses sight of the class point of view, obscures it by chauvinism anddisrupts the unity of the present-day political struggle, thatprevents us from regarding the P. 
S. 
P. 
 as a genuine Social-Democratic workers’ party. 
 This, for instance, is how theP. 
S. 
P. 
 usually presents the question: “... We can only weaken tsarism by wresting Poland from it; it is the task of the Rus-sian comrades to overthrow it. 
” Or again: “... After the over-throw of tsarism we would simply decide our fate by se-ceding from Russia. 
” See to what monstrous conclusionsthis monstrous logic leads, even from the viewpoint of theprogramme demand for Poland’s restoration. 
 Because the restoration of Poland is one of the possible (but, whilst the bourgeoisie rules, by no means absolutely certain)consequences of democratic evolution, therefore the Polish proletariat must not fight together with the Russian prole-tariat to overthrow tsarism, but “only” to weaken it by wrest-ing Poland from it. 
 Because Russian tsarism is concluding a closer and closer alliance with the bourgeoisie and the gov-ernments of Germany, Austria, etc. 
, therefore the Polish proletariat must weaken its alliance with the proletariat ofRussia, Germany, etc. 
, together with whom it is now fightingagainst one and the same yoke. 
 This is nothing more than sac-rificing the most vital interests of the proletariat to the bour-geois-democratic conception of national independence. 
 Thedisintegration of Russia which the P. 
S. 
P. 
 desires, as distinct from our aim of overthrowing tsarism, is and will remain an empty phrase, as long as economic development contin-ues to bring the different parts of a political whole more and more closely together, and as long as the bourgeoisie of all countries unite more and more closely against their commonenemy, the proletariat, and in support of their common ally,the tsar. 
 But the division of the forces of the proletariat , which is now suffering under the yoke of this autocracy, isthe sad reality, the direct consequence of the error of the P. 
S. 
P. 
, the direct outcome of its worship of bourgeois-dem-ocratic formulas. 
 To turn a blind eye to this division of theproletariat, the P. 
S. 
P. 
 has to stoop to chauvinism and presentthe views of the Russian Social-Democrats as follows: “We[the Poles] must wait for the social revolution, and until thenwe must patiently endure national oppression. 
” This is an utter falsehood. 
 The Russian Social-Democrats have never advised anything of the sort; on the contrary, they themselvesfight, and call upon the whole Russian proletariat to fight,against all manifestations of national oppression in Russia;they include in their programme not only complete equality of status for all languages, nationalities, etc. 
, but also rec-ognition of every nation’s right to determine its own des-tiny. 
 Recognising this right, we subordinate to the inter-ests of the proletarian struggle our support of the demandfor national independence, and only a chauvinist caninterpret our position as an expression of a Russian’smistrust of a non-Russian, for in reality this position neces-sarily follows from the class-conscious proletarian’s distrust of the bourgeoisie. 
 The P. 
S. 
P. 
 takes the view that the nationalquestion is exhausted by the contrast—“we” (Poles) and “they” (Germans, Russians, etc. 
). 
 The Social-Democrat, however, gives first place to the contrast—“we”, the proletarians, and “they”, the bourgeoisie. 
 “We”, the proletarians, have seen dozens of times how the bourgeoisie betrays the interests of freedom, motherland, language, and nation, when it is con-fronted with the revolutionary proletariat. 
 We witnessedthe French bourgeoisie’s surrender to the Prussians at themoment of the greatest humiliation and suppression of the French nation, the Government of National Defence becoming a Government of National Defection, the bourgeoisie of anoppressed nation calling to its aid the troops of the oppress-ing nation so as to crush its proletarian fellow countrymen,who had dared to assume power. 
 And that is why, unde-terred by chauvinist and opportunist heckling, we shall always say to the Polish workers: only the most complete and intimate alliance with the Russian proletariat can meetthe requirements of the present political struggle againstthe autocracy; only such an alliance can guarantee completepolitical and economic emancipation. 
 What we have said on the Polish question is wholly applic-able to every other national question. 
 The accursed history of autocracy has left us a legacy of tremendous estrangement between the working classes of the various nationalitiesoppressed by that autocracy. 
 This estrangement is a verygreat evil, a very great obstacle in the struggle against theautocracy, and we must not legitimise this evil or sanctify this outrageous state of affairs by establishing any such “principles” as separate parties or a “federation” of parties. 
It is, of course, simpler and easier to follow the line of leastresistance, and for everyone to make himself comfortable inhis own corner following the rule, “it’s none of my business”,as the Bund now wants to do. 
 The more we realise the need for unity and the more firmly we are convinced that a con-certed offensive against the autocracy is impossible withoutcomplete unity, the more obvious becomes the necessityfor a centralised organisation of the struggle in the conditionsof our political system—the less inclined are we to be satis-fied with a “simple”, but specious and, at bottom, profoundly false solution of the problem. 
 So long as the injuriousness of estrangement is not realised, and so long as there is nodesire to put an end radically and at all costs to this estrangement in the camp of the proletarian party, there is no need for the fig-leaf of “federation”, and no use in under-taking to solve a problem which one of the “sides” concerned has no real desire to solve. 
 That being the case, it is betterto let the lessons of experience and of the actual movementprove that centralism is essential for success in the strugglewaged by the proletarians of all nationalities oppressed byautocracy against that autocracy and against the interna-tional bourgeoisie, which is becoming more and more united.

 1 DRAFT RESOLUTION ON DEMONSTRATIONS The Congress considers the organisation of public demon-strations against the autocracy a highly important meansof political education of the working masses. 
 In this con-nection, the Congress recommends, firstly, that specialefforts should be made to utilise for demonstrations such instances and circumstances when some atrocious act by the tsarist government has aroused particularly widespread in-dignation among the people; secondly, that efforts shouldbe most of all directed to securing the participation ofbroad masses of the working class in the demonstrations and the best possible organisation of the latter, in regard to preparation for them, their efficient handling, and guidance of demonstrators' resistance to the troops and police; thirdly,that preparations for armed demonstrations should bebegun, strictly observing instructions of the Central Com-mittee in this respect. 
 The Congress also recommends that all committees and other organisations of the Party should thoroughly discuss the question of preparations for an armed uprising andshould make every effort to convince the working masses ofthe necessity and inevitability of an uprising. 
 The practicalmeasures which can already be taken in preparing for an up-rising are entrusted by the Congress exclusively and entire-ly to the Central Committee.

 3 DRAFT RESOLUTION ON THE ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE STUDENT YOUTH The Second Congress of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party welcomes the growing revolutionary initia-tive among the student youth and calls upon all organisa-tions of the Party to give them every possible assistance intheir efforts to organise. 
 It recommends that all studentgroups and study circles should, firstly, make it the prime ob-ject of their activities to imbue their members with an in-tegral and consistent socialist world outlook and give them athorough acquaintance with Marxism, on the one hand, andwith Russian Narodism and West-European opportunism, onthe other, these being the principal currents among theconflicting advanced trends of today; secondly, that they should beware of those false friends of the youth who divert them from a thorough revolutionary training through re-course to empty revolutionary or idealistic phrase-monger-ing and philistine complaints about the harm and useless-ness of sharp polemics between the revolutionary and theopposition movements, for as a matter of fact these false friends are only spreading an unprincipled and unserious atti-tude towards revolutionary work; thirdly, that they shouldendeavour, when undertaking practical activities, to estab-lish prior contact with the Social-Democratic organisations,so as to have the benefit of their advice and, as far as possi-ble, to avoid serious mistakes at the very outset of their work.

 4 DRAFT RESOLUTION ON PARTY LITERATURE The Congress recognises the absolute and urgent necessity for a wide production of popular Social-Democratic literature for all sections of the population, and for the working-class masses in particular. 
 The Congress considers it necessary in the first place to compile a series of pamphlets (each ranging from one to fivesignatures in size) dealing with each (theoretical and prac-tical) point of our Party programme and giving a detailed exposition and explanation of that point; and then a num-ber of leaflets (ranging from one to eight printed pages each)on the same subjects to be scattered or distributed in townand country. 
 The Congress instructs the editorial board ofthe Central Organ to immediately take all steps to fulfilthis task. 
 As regards publication of a special popular newspaper for the people or for the broad sections of the working class,the Congress, though it does not reject this project in prin-ciple, considers it untimely at the immediate moment. 
 Written in June-July 1903 First published in 1927 Published according in Lenin Miscellany VI to the manuscript 5 DRAFTS OF MINOR RESOLUTIONS THE ECONOMIC STRUGGLE The Congress deems it absolutely essential in all cases to support and develop in every way the economic struggle of the workers and their trade unions (principally the all-Russian unions) and from the very outset to ensure that theeconomic struggle and the trade-union movement in Russiahave a Social-Democratic character. 
 MAY DAY The Congress approves the celebration of the First of May, which has already become a tradition, and draws theattention of all Party organisations to the necessity ofselecting the time and ways most suitable under existingconditions for celebrating this international holiday of the proletariat's struggle for freedom. 
 INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS The Congress appoints Comrade Plekhanov to represent the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party in the Secre-tariat of the Socialist International (in amendment of the Paris decision to appoint Plekhanov and Krichevsky joint representatives). 
 The Congress instructs the editorial board of the Central Organ and the Central Committee to arrange, by agreementbetween them (or by decision of the Party Council), forthe Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party to be repre-sented at the International Socialist Congress in Amster-dam in 1904. 
 TERRORISM The Congress decisively rejects terrorism, i. 
e. 
, the sys-tem of individual political assassinations, as being a method of political struggle which is most inexpedient at the present time, diverting the best forces from the urgent andimperatively necessary work of organisation and agitation,destroying contact between the revolutionaries and themasses of the revolutionary classes of the population, andspreading both among the revolutionaries themselves and the population in general utterly destorted ideas of the aims and methods of struggle against the autocracy. 
 PROPAGANDA The Congress calls the attention of all Party members to the importance of improving the theoretical knowledge ofour propagandists and of forming groups of travelling lectur-ers so as to co-ordinate propaganda throughout the country. 
 OF FORCES The Congress recommends to all comrades returning to Russia from abroad or from exile to their place of activ-ity, especially if they do not have well-established con-tacts with any committee, that they should endeavour to give timely notice to the Central Committee or its agents so, as to enable the Central Committee properly and promptlyto distribute revolutionary forces throughout Russia.

 By way of experiment, the Congress permits ComradeV. 
 Bonch-Bruyevich to publish, under the supervisionof the editorial board of the Central Organ, a popular news-paper entitled Among Sectarians , and instructs the Central Committee and the editorial board of the Central Organ to take the measures necessary to ensure successful publication of this newspaper and to create all the conditions for itsproper functioning.

S.

L. 
P. 
 The Congress deeply regrets this step, which, it is con-vinced, is a major political mistake on the part of thepresent leaders of the “Jewish Workers’ Union”, a mistakewhich must inevitably injure the interests of the Jewishproletariat and working-class movement. 
 The Congress considers that the arguments cited by the Bund delegates in justification of their step amount in practice to entirelyunfounded apprehensions and suspicion that the Social-Demo-cratic convictions of the Russian Social-Democrats areinsincere and inconsistent; in respect of theory they are theresult of the unfortunate penetration of nationalism into the Social-Democratic movement of the Bund. 
 The Congress voices its desire for, and firm conviction of, the need for complete and closest unity of the Jewishand Russian working-class movement in Russia, unity notonly in principle but also in organisation, and resolves totake all measures in order to acquaint the Jewish proletariat in detail both with this resolution of the Congress and with the general attitude of the Russian Social-Democratstowards every national movement. 
 SEPARATE GROUPS The Congress expresses its regret at the separate existence of such groups of Social-Democrats as the Borba , Zhizn and Volya . 
 Their separateness cannot but, on the one hand, lead to disorganisation impermissible in the Party, and on theother hand, to regrettable departures from Social-Demo-cratic views and Social-Democratic tactics towards so-called socialist-revolutionism (as exemplified by the Volya group and partially also by the Borba in its agrarian programme), or towards Christian socialism and anarchism ( Zhizn ). 
 The Congress would like to see the above-mentioned groups, andin general all groups which identify themselves withSocial-Democracy, join the ranks of united and organised Russian Social-Democracy. 
 The Congress instructs the Cen-tral Committee to collect the necessary information and toadopt a final decision on the place of the above-mentionedand other separate groups within the Party, or on the atti-tude of the Party towards these groups. 
 THE ARMY The Congress calls the attention of all Party organisa-tions to the importance of Social-Democratic propagandaand agitation in the army, and recommends that all effortsshould be made for the speediest strengthening and properchannelling of all the existing contacts among the officers and other ranks. 
 The Congress considers it desirable to form spe-cial groups of Social-Democrats serving in the army, in orderthat these groups should occupy a definite position in thelocal committees (as branches of the committees), or in thecentral organisation (as institutions formed directly by theCentral Committee and subordinated directly to it). 
 THE PEASANTRY The Congress calls the special attention of all Party mem-bers to the importance of developing and strengtheningwork among the peasantry. 
 It is necessary to acquaint thepeasantry (and, especially, the rural proletariat) with the Social-Democratic programme in its entirety, and to explain the significance of the agrarian programme as the first and immediate demands under the existing system. 
 It is necessary to get class-conscious peasants and intellectuals in the countryside to form solidly united groups of Social-Demo-crats, which would maintain constant contact with the Partycommittees. 
 It is necessary to counter the propaganda con-ducted among the peasantry by the Socialist-Revolution-aries, propaganda which spreads unprincipledness andreactionary Narodnik prejudices. 
 Written on August 5 (18)-10 (23), 1903 First published in 1930 Published according in Lenin Miscellany XV to the manuscript 9 FIRST SPEECH ON THE AGENDA OF THE CONGRESS July 18 (31) I should like to make a remark. 
 It would be wrong, it is claimed, to make the question of the Bund the first item on the agenda, since the reports should be the first item, theprogramme the second, and the Bund the third. 
 The argu-ments in favour of this order will not stand criticism. 
 Theyamount to the presumption that the Party as a whole hasnot yet reached agreement on the programme, and that it is possible that precisely on this question we may part com-pany. 
 I am surprised at that. 
 It is true that we have not yetadopted a programme, but the surmise that a rupture maytake place over the programme is conjectural in the highestdegree. 
 No such tendencies have been discernible in theParty, at least as far as its literature is concerned, which of late has given the fullest reflection of Party opinion. 
 There are both formal and moral reasons for making the question ofthe Bund the first item on the agenda. 
 Formally, we standby the Manifesto of 1898, but the Bund has expressed adesire for a radical change in our Party’s organisation. 
 Mor-ally, many other organisations have expressed their dis-agreement with the Bund over this question; that has caused sharp differences leading even to polemics. 
 The Congresstherefore cannot begin harmonious work until these differ-ences have been removed. 
 As to the delegates’ reports, itis possible that they may not be heard in pleno at all. 
 I therefore second the agenda in the order approved by the Organising Committee. 
 10 SECOND SPEECH ON THE AGENDA OF THE CONGRESS July 18 (31) Now that the Congress has decided what shall be the first item on our agenda, the third point is the only moot point with regard to the rest of the agenda. 
 This item reads:“Creation of the Central Organ of the Party, or endorsementof such. 
” Some comrades consider that this item shouldbe shifted farther down, because, firstly, one cannot speakof the Central Organ until a decision has been taken on the organisation of the Party in general and of its central body in particular, and so on; and, secondly, because many com-mittees have already expressed their views on the substanceof this question. 
 I consider the second argument wrong, fordeclarations by the committees are not binding on theCongress and, formally speaking, have no deciding vote at the Congress. 
 The other objection is wrong because, before set-tling details of organisation, the Party Rules, and the like,we must first definitely decide on the trend of Russian So-cial-Democracy. 
 In fact, it is this question that has dividedus so long, and the mere adoption of a programme cannotremove all the differences dividing us on this issue; that can be done only by deciding, immediately after the question of the programme, what kind of Central Organ of the Party weshould form anew, or what old one we should endorse withcertain modifications. 
 That is why I second the agenda in the order endorsed by the Organising Committee. 
 11 SPEECH ON THE ACTIONS OF THE ORGANISING COMMITTEE July 18 (31)136 I cannot agree with Comrade Yegorov. 
 It is he who has in-fringed the standing orders of the Congress and it is he who is against the clause on imperative mandates. 
 I do not doubtthe existence of the Organising Committee, just as I do notdoubt the existence of the Iskra organisation, which also has its own organisation and its own Rules. 
 But as soon as thestanding orders of the Congress were announced, the Iskra organisation informed its delegates that they have full freedom of action at the Congress. 
 Just imagine our position,as members of the Credentials Committee of the Congress,who yesterday heard two members of the Organising Com-mittee, Comrades Stein and Pavlovich, and today are hearingan entirely new proposal. 
 There are experienced comrades here who have attended many international congresses. 
 These comrades could tell you what a storm of indignationhas always been aroused when people say one thing at com-mittees and another on the floor of the Congress. 
 12 SPEECH ON THE ATTENDANCE OF THE POLISH SOCIAL-DEMOCRATS AT THE CONGRESS July 18 (31) In its report, the committee holds that the Polish comrades’ presence at the Congress is desirable, but only in a delib-erative capacity. 
 In my opinion that is quite right, and itseems to me quite reasonable to begin the resolution of thecommittee with a statement to this effect. 
 The presence ofthe Letts and the Lithuanians would also be highly desirable, but, unfortunately, that is not feasible. 
 The Polish com-rades could have announced their conditions of affiliation atany time, but they did not do so. 
 The Organising Commit-tee was therefore right in exercising restraint towardsthem. 
 Nor is the question clarified by the letter from thePolish Social-Democrats which was read here. 
 In view of this, I move that the Polish comrades be invited as guests. 
 13 SPEECH ON THE PLACE OF THE BUND IN THE R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 July 20 (August 2) I shall first deal with Hofman’s137 speech and his expres-sion “a compact majority”. 
 Comrade Hofman uses these words by way of reproach. 
 In my opinion we should be proud,not ashamed, of the fact that there is a compact majority atthe Congress. 
 And we shall be prouder still if our whole Partyproves to be a compact, a highly compact, 90 per cent, ma-jority. 
 ( Applause . 
) The majority were right in making the position of the Bund in the Party the first item on the agen-da, and the Bundists at once proved this by submittingtheir so-called Rules, but in essence proposing federation . 
 Once there are members in the Party who propose federationand others who reject it, there could be no other course openbut to make the question of the Bund the first item on the agenda. 
 It is no use forcing your favours on anybody, and the internal affairs of the Party cannot be discussed until wehave firmly and uncompromisingly settled whether or notwe want to march together. 
 The crux of the issue has not always been presented quite correctly in the debate. 
 The point of the matter is that, in the opinion of many Party members, federation is harmful and runs counter to the principles of Social-Democracy asapplied to existing Russian conditions. 
 Federation is harm-ful because it sanctions segregation and alienation, elevates them to a principle, to a law. 
 Complete alienation does in-deed prevail among us, and we ought not to sanction it, or cover it with a fig-leaf, but combat it and resolutely acknowl-edge and proclaim the necessity of firmly and unswervinglyadvancing towards the closest unity. 
 That is why we reject federation in principle, in limine * (as the Latin phrase has it); that is why we reject all obligatory partitions that serve to divide us. 
 As it is, there will always be different groupings in the Party, groupings of comrades who do notthink quite alike on questions of programme, tactics or or-ganisation; but let there be only one division into groups throughout the Party, that is, let all like-minded membersjoin in a single group, instead of groups first being formed in one section of the Party, separately from the groups in anoth-er section of the Party, and then having a union not of groupsholding different views or different shades of opinion, butof sections of the Party, each containing different groups. 
I repeat, we recognise no obligatory partitions, and that is why we reject federation in principle. 
 I shall now pass to the question of autonomy. 
 Comrade Lieber has said that federation means centralism, whileautonomy means decentralism. 
 Can it be that Comrade Liebertakes the Congress members for six-year-old children, whomay be regaled with such sophistries? Is it not clear that cen-tralism demands the absence of all partitions between the central body and even the most remote and out-of-the-way sections of the Party? Our central body will be given theabsolute right to communicate directly with every Partymember. 
 The Bundists would only laugh if someone wouldpropose to them a form of “centralism” within the Bund, un-der which its Central Committee could not communicate with all the Kovno groups and comrades otherwise than through the Kovno Committee. 
 Incidentally, as regards thecommittees: Comrade Lieber has exclaimed with feeling,“What is the good of talking about the Bund’s autonomy ifit is to be an organisation subordinated to one centralbody? After all, you would not grant autonomy to some Tula Committee!” You are mistaken, Comrade Lieber; we will certainly and most decidedly grant autonomy to “some”Tula Committee, too, autonomy in the sense of freedom frompetty interference by the central body, although the duty ofobeying that body will, of course, remain. 
 I have taken thewords “petty interference” from the Bund leaflet, “Autonomy or Federation?” The Bund has advanced this freedom from *On the threshold. 
— Ed. 
 /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR “petty interference” as a condition , as a demand to the Party. 
 The mere fact that it advances such ridiculous demands shows how muddled the Bund is on the question at issue. 
 Does the Bund really think that the Party would tolerate theexistence of a central body that indulged in “ petty ” interfer-ence in the affairs of any Party organisation or group? Is this not, in effect, precisely that “organised distrust” which hasalready been mentioned at this Congress? Such distrust runs through all the proposals and arguments of the Bundists. 
 Is it not, in fact, the duty of our entire Party to fight, for exam-ple, for full equality and even for recognition of the right of nations to self-determination? Consequently, if any sectionof our Party failed in this duty, it would unquestionably beliable to condemnation by virtue of our principles; it would unquestionably be liable to correction on the part of the central institutions of the Party. 
 And if the neglect of thatduty were conscious and deliberate, despite full opportunityto carry out that duty, then that would be treachery . 
 Further. 
 Comrade Lieber has asked us in moving tones how it can he proved that autonomy is able to guarantee to the Jewish workers’ movement that independence which is ab-solutely essential to it. 
 A strange question, indeed! How canit be proved that one of the several paths suggested is theright one? The only way is to try it and see. 
 My reply toComrade Lieber’s question is: M a r c h w i t h u s , and we undertake to prove to you in practice that all legitimate de-mands for independence are gratified in full. 
 When I hear disputes about the place of the Bund, I always recollect the British miners. 
 They are excellentlyorganised, better than any other workers. 
 And because of that they want to thwart the general demand for an 8-hour day put forward by all proletarians. 
 138 These miners have the same narrow idea of the unity of the proletariat as our Bundists. 
 Let the sad example of the miners serve as a warn-ing to our comrades of the Bund. 
 14 SPEECH ON THE PARTY PROGRAMME July 22 (August 4) First of all, I must draw attention to the highly char-acteristic way in which Comrade Lieber confuses a Marshalof the Nobility with a section of the toilers and the exploited. 
This confusion is a feature of all the debates. 
 Isolated epi-sodes of our controversy are being everywhere confused withthe establishment of basic principles. 
 One cannot deny, as Comrade Lieber does, the possibility of even a section (one or another) of the working and exploited population comingover to the side of the proletariat. 
 You will recall that in1852, referring to the revolt of the French peasants, Marxwrote (in The Eighteenth Brumaire ) that the peasantry acts sometimes as a representative of the past and sometimes as a representative of the future; one can appeal not only to the peasant’s prejudice, but to his judgement 139 as well. 
 You will further recall that Marx said the Communardswere quite right in declaring the cause of the Communethat of the peasantry as well. 
 140 I repeat, it cannot be doubt-ed that, under certain conditions, it is by no means impos-sible for one section or another of the working people to come over to the side of the proletariat. 
 The important thingis to define these conditions correctly. 
 And the condition weare speaking of is expressed quite accurately in the words“place themselves at the standpoint of the proletariat”. 
 Itis these words that draw a definite line of demarcation be-tween us, Social-Democrats, and all pseudo-socialist trends in general, and the so-called Socialist-Revolutionaries inparticular. 
 I shall now go over to that disputed passage in my pam-phlet, What Is to Be Done? , which gave rise to so much dis-cussion here. 
 After all this discussion, I think that the ques-tion has been so clarified that very little remains for me toadd. 
 It is obvious that here an episode in the struggle against“economism” has been confused with a discussion of theprinciples of a major theoretical question (the formation ofan ideology). 
 Moreover, this episode has been presented in an absolutely false light. 
 In support of this last statement, I might refer first of all to Comrades Akimov and Martynov, who spoke here. 
They made it quite clear that it was indeed an episode in thestruggle against “economism” which was at issue here. 
They expressed views which have already been termed op-portunism (and quite rightly so). 
 They actually went so far as to “refute” the theory of impoverishment, to disputethe dictatorship of the proletariat, and even to advocatethe “ Erfüllungstheorie ”, as Comrade Akimov called it. 
 To tell the truth, I do not quite know what that means. 
 Per-haps Comrade Akimov meant to say “ Aushöhlungstheorie ”— the “theory of the hollowing out” of capitalism, that is, one of the most popular and current ideas of the Bernsteiniantheory. 
 In his defence of the old mainstays of “economism”,Comrade Akimov even advanced such an incredibly eccentricargument as that the word proletariat does not figure inour programme even once in the nominative case. 
 At most, Comrade Akimov exclaimed, they have the proletariat in the genitive case. 
 And so it appears that the nominative is themost honourable case, whereas the genitive takes secondplace in the scale of honour. 
 It only remains to convey thisidea—through a special commission, perhaps—to ComradeRyazanov, so as to enable him to supplement his first sci-entific work on the letters of the alphabet with another treatise on the cases.... 
 As to the direct references to my pamphlet, What Is to Be Done? , it will be quite easy for me to show that they have been wrenched from the context. 
 It is claimed thatLenin says nothing about any conflicting trends, but cate-gorically affirms that the working-class movement invari-ably “ tends ” to succumb to bourgeois ideology. 
 Is that so? Have I not said that the working-class movement is drawn towards the bourgeois outlook with the benevolent assis-tance of the Schulze-Delitzsches and others like them ?* And who is meant here by “others like them”? None other than the “economists”, none other than those who, for example,used to say then that bourgeois democracy in Russia is aphantom. 
 Today it is easy to talk so cheaply about bourgeoisradicalism and liberalism, when examples of them are to befound right before us. 
 But was that the case previously? Lenin takes no account whatever of the fact that the work-ers, too, have a share in the formation of an ideology. 
 Isthat so? Have I not said time and again that the shortageof fully class-conscious workers, worker-leaders, and worker-revolutionaries is, in fact, the greatest deficiency inour movement? Have I not said there that the training of such worker-revolutionaries must be our immediate task? Is there no mention there of the importance of developing atrade-union movement and creating a special trade-unionliterature? Is not a desperate struggle waged there againstevery attempt to lower the level of the advanced workers tothat of the masses, or of the average workers? ** To conclude. 
 We all now know that the “economists” have gone to one extreme. 
 To straighten matters out some-body had to pull in the other direction—and that is whatI have done. 
 I am convinced that Russian Social-Democracywill always vigorously straighten out whatever has beentwisted by opportunism of any kind, and that therefore our line of action will always be the straightest and the fittest for action.

 15 REPORT ON THE PARTY RULES July 29 (August 11) Lenin (the reporter) gives an explanation of the draft Rules submitted by him. 
 The basic idea of the Rules, he says, is that of a division of functions . 
 Hence, the division into two central bodies, for example, is not due to theirgeographical division (Russia and abroad), but is a logicalconsequence of a division of functions. 
 It is the functionof the Central Committee to exercise practical leadership, that of the Central Organ to exercise ideological leadership. 
 To co-ordinate the activities of these two central bodies, topreclude disunity between them, and, in part, to settledisputes, a Council is needed, which should not at all bepurely an institution of arbitration. 
 The paragraphs in theRules which govern the relations between the Central Com-mittee and the local committees, and define the Central Committee’s competence cannot and should not enumerateall the points within that competence. 
 Such an enu-meration is inconvenient and impossible, for it is inconceiv-able that all possible cases should be foreseen, and, more-over, points unprovided for might appear to be outside the competence of the Central Committee. 
 The Central Commit-tee itself should be allowed to determine the sphere of itscompetence, since any local matter may affect the inter-ests of the Party as a whole, and the Central Committeeshould be in a position to intervene in local affairs, evengoing against local interests, should such action be in the interests of the Party as a whole. 
 16 FIRST SPEECH IN THE DISCUSSION ON THE AGRARIAN PROGRAMME July 31 (August 13) I shall in the first place mention a detail that came up during the debate. 
 Comrade Yegorov expressed regret thatthere was no report which might have considerably facilitatedand directed our whole debate. 
 Since it was I who was sug-gested as reporter, I shall, in a manner of speaking, have todefend myself for the absence of a report. 
 And I shall say in my defence that I have a report: it is my reply to Com-rade X, * which, in fact, replies to the most widespread of the objections and misunderstandings aroused by our agrar-ian programme, and has been distributed to all the Congressdelegates. 
 A report is no less a report for having been printedand distributed to the delegates instead of being deliv-ered by word of mouth. 
 I shall now pass to the contents of the speeches by those who, unfortunately, have disregarded this particular re-port of mine. 
 Comrade Martynov, for example, failed evento take account of the earlier literature on our agrarian pro-gramme, when he spoke again and again about redressing a historical injustice, of a needless reversion to forty years back, of the destruction of the feudalism of the sixties,rather than that of today, and so on. 
 In replying to thesearguments, I shall have to repeat what I have said before. 
If we acted s o l e l y on the principle of “redressing a his-torical injustice”, we would be guiding ourselves by nothing but democratic phraseology. 
 But we refer to the survivals *See pp. 
 438-53 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 of serf-ownership which exist around us, to present-day reali-ties, to what is today hampering and retarding the proletar-iat’s struggle for emancipation. 
 We are accused of revert-ing to the hoary past. 
 This accusation reveals only anignorance of the most generally known facts regarding theactivities of Social-Democrats in all countries. 
 One of theaims they set themselves and work for everywhere is to com-plete what the bourgeoisie has left unfinished . 
 That is what we are doing. 
 And in order to do so, we have unavoidably to revert to the past; and that is what the Social-Democratsin every country are doing, always reverting to their 1789, or to their 1848. 
 Similarly, the Russian Social-Democrats cannot but revert to their 1861, and must do so all the more energetically and frequently since our so-called peasant “Reform” has achieved so little in the way of democratic changes. 
 As to Comrade Gorin, he too is guilty of the common er-ror of forgetting the serf bondage that actually exists. 
Comrade Gorin says that “hope of getting the cut-off landsperforce keeps the small peasant bound to an anti-proletarian ideology”. 
 Actually, however, it is not “hope” that he will get the cut-off lands, but the present cut-off lands themselves that forcibly maintain serf bondage, and there is no way outof this bondage, out of these serf forms of land leasing,except by converting the pseudo-tenants into freeowners. 
 Lastly, Comrade Yegorov asked the authors of the pro-gramme what the programme signified. 
 Is the programme, heasked, a conclusion drawn from our basic conceptions ofthe economic evolution of Russia, a scientific anticipation ofthe possible and inevitable result of political changes (inwhich case Comrade Yegorov might agree with us)? Or is our programme a practical slogan for agitation? In that case we could not beat the record of the Socialist-Revolutionaries,and the programme must be regarded as incorrect. 
 I mustsay that I do not understand the distinction Comrade Yegorovdraws. 
 If our programme did not meet the first condition,it would be incorrect and we could not accept it. 
 If, how-ever, the programme is correct, it cannot but furnish a slogan of practical value for purposes of agitation. 
 Thecontradiction between Comrade Yegorov’s two alternatives is only a seeming one; it cannot exist in fact, because a correct theoretical decision guarantees enduring success in agitation. 
 And it is for enduring success that we are working, not in the least disconcerted by temporary reverses. 
 Comrade Lieber likewise repeated objections long ago refuted; he was astonished at the “meagreness” of our pro-gramme and demanded “radical reforms” in the agrariansphere as well. 
 Comrade Lieber has forgotten the difference between the democratic and the socialist parts of the pro-gramme: what he has taken for “meagreness” is the absenceof anything socialistic in the democratic programme. 
 He hasfailed to notice that the socialist part of our agrarian programmeis to be found elsewhere, namely in the section on theworkers, which also applies to agriculture. 
 Only Socialist-Revolutionaries, with their characteristic lack of principle, are capable of confusing, as they constantly do, democraticand socialistic demands. 
 But the party of the proletariatis in duty bound to separate and distinguish between themin the strictest fashion. 
 17 SECOND SPEECH IN THE DISCUSSION ON THE AGRARIAN PROGRAMME August 1 (14) Before passing to details, I want to object to certain general statements, and in the first place to those of Com-rade Martynov. 
 Comrade Martynov says that it is not thefeudalism of the past we must combat, but the feudalismthat exists today. 
 That is true, but let me remind you ofmy reply to X. 
 The latter referred to Saratov Gubernia. 
 I have consulted the data for that gubernia and found that the cut-off lands there amount to 600,000 dessiatines, i. 
e. 
,two-fifths of the total land held by the peasants underserfdom, while the rented land amounts to 900,000 dessia-tines. 
 Consequently, two-thirds of the rented land consistsof cut-off lands. 
 That means that we are out to restore two-thirds of the land held in tenure. 
 Hence it is not a ghost we are fighting, but a real evil. 
 We would arrive atthe state of affairs which exists in Ireland, where the pres-ent peasant reform was required, which is turning the tenantfarmers into small owners. 
 The analogy between Ireland andRussia was already pointed out by the Narodniks in their economic literature. 
 Comrade Gorin says that the measure I propose is not the best; that it would be better to turnthe peasants into free tenant farmers. 
 But he is mistakenin thinking that it could be better to turn semi-free tenantsinto free tenants. 
 We are not inventing a transition, butare proposing one that would bring the land tenure laws into conformity with the actually existing conditions of land tenure, thereby abolishing the bondage relations thatesist today. 
 Martynov says that it is not our demands that are meagre, but the principle from which they are derived. 
 But that is like the arguments the Socialist-Rev-olutionaries bring against us. 
 We are pursuing two qual-itatively different aims in the countryside: firstly, wewant to achieve freedom for bourgeois relations; secondly,we want to conduct the proletarian struggle. 
 Despite theSocialist-Revolutionaries’ prejudices, it is our task to showthe peasants where the revolutionary proletarian task of the peasant proletariat begins. 
 Comrade Kostrov’s ob-jections are therefore groundless. 
 We are told that the peas-ants will not be satisfied with our programme and willgo further. 
 But we are not afraid of that; we have our so-cialist programme for that eventuality, and consequentlyare not afraid even of a redistribution of the land, which terrifies Comrades Makhov and Kostrov 141 so much. 
 I conclude. 
 Comrade Yegorov has called our reliance on the peasants chimerical. 
 No! We are not carried away; weare sufficiently sceptical, and that is why we say to thepeasant proletarian: “Now you are fighting by the side ofthe peasant bourgeoisie, but you must always be prepared to fight against that same bourgeoisie, and you will wage that fight together with the urban industrial proletarians. 
” In 1852 Marx said that the peasants had judgement as well as prejudices. 
 And now, when we point out to thepoor peasants the cause of their poverty, we may count onsuccess. 
 We believe that, since the Social-Democrats have now taken up the struggle for the interests of the peasants, we shall in future be reckoning with the fact that the peasantmasses will get used to looking upon Social-Democracyas the defender of their interests. 
 18 THIRD SPEECH IN THE DISCUSSION ON THE AGRARIAN PROGRAMME August 1 (14) There is nothing for Comrade Lieber to be surprised at. 
 He demands of us a single general criterion, but there is nosuch criterion. 
 Sometimes one demand has to be made,at other times another. 
 We have no stereotyped standards. 
Lieber claims that our demand for the abolition of serf-ownership coincides with the liberals’ demands. 
 But the liberals do not say how this demand is to be carried out. 
We, for our part, say that it must be carried out not bythe bureaucracy, but by the oppressed classes, and thatmeans the way of revolution. 
 Therein lies the fundamentaldifference between us and the liberals, whose talk about changes and reforms “pollutes” the minds of the people. 
 If we were to set forth in detail all the demands for the abo-lition of serf-ownership, we should fill whole volumes. 
That is why we mention only the more important forms andvarieties of serfdom, and leave it to our committees in thevarious localities to draw up and advance their particular demands in development of the general programme. 
 Trotsky’s remark to the effect that we cannot concern ourselves withlocal demands is wrong, for the question of the khizani and the temporarily bound peasants 142 is not only a local one. 
 Moreover, it is known in agrarian literature. 
 19 FOURTH SPEECH IN THE DISCUSSION ON THE AGRARIAN PROGRAMME August 1 (14) Comrade Lieber proposes deletion of the clause on the cut-off lands, on the sole grounds that he does not likethe peasant committees. 
 That is strange. 
 Since we haveagreed on the fundamental question—that the cut-off landskeep the peasants in bondage—the formation of committees is only a secondary matter, and to reject the whole clause on account of that would be illogical. 
 It is strange, too,to hear the question as to how we are to influence the peas-ant committees. 
 I hope that the Social-Democrats willthen find it easier to arrange congresses, and will theredecide how to act in each particular case. 
 20 FIRST SPEECH IN THE DISCUSSION ON THE PARTY RULES August 2 (15) Lenin delivers a brief speech in support of his formu-lation, emphasising in particular its stimulating effect: “Organise!” It should not be imagined that Party organisa-tions must consist solely of professional revolutionaries. 
We need the most diverse organisations of all types, ranksand shades, beginning with extremely limited and secretand ending with very broad, free, lose Organisationen . 
 Its endorsement by the Central Committee is an essential condi-tion for a Party organisation. 
 21 SECOND SPEECH IN THE DISCUSSION ON THE PARTY RULES August 2 (15) I should like first of all to make two remarks on minor points. 
 First, on the subject of Axelrod’s kind pro-posal (I am not speaking ironically) to “strike a bargain”. 
I would willingly respond to this appeal, for I by no meansconsider our difference so vital as to be a matter of lifeor death to the Party. 
 We shall certainly not perishbecause of an unfortunate clause in the Rules! But since it has come to the point of choosing between two formula-tions, I simply cannot abandon my firm conviction that Mar-tov’s formulation is worse than the original draft and may , in certain circumstances, cause no little harm to the Party. 
The second remark concerns Comrade Brucker. 
 143 It is only natural for Comrade Brucker, who wishes to apply the elective principle everywhere, to have accepted my formulation, the only one that defines at all exactly theconcept of a Party member . 
 I therefore fail to understand Comrade Martov’s delight at Comrade Brucker’s agreementwith me. 
 Is it possible that in actual fact Comrade Martovmakes a point of guiding himself by the opposite of what Brucker says, without examining his motives and argu-ments? To come to the main subject, I must say that Comrade Trotsky has completely misunderstood Comrade Plekhanov’sfundamental idea, and his arguments have therefore evadedthe gist of the matter. 
 He has spoken of intellectuals and workers, of the class point of view and of the mass move-ment, but he has failed to notice a basic question: doesmy formulation narrow or expand the concept of a Party member? If he had asked himself that question, he would easily have seen that my formulation narrows this concept, while Martov’s expands it, for (to use Martov’s own correct expression) what distinguishes his concept is its “elastic-ity”. 
 And in the period of Party life that we are now pass-ing through it is just this “elasticity” that undoubtedlyopens the door to all elements of confusion, vacillation,and opportunism. 
 To refute this simple and obvious con-clusion it has to be proved that there are no such elements; but it has not even occurred to Comrade Trotsky to do that. 
Nor can that be proved, for everyone knows that such ele-ments exist in plenty, and that they are to be found inthe working class too. 
 The need to safeguard the firmnessof the Party’s line and the purity of its principles has now become particularly urgent, for, with the restoration of its unity, the Party will recruit into its ranks a great manyunstable elements, whose number will increase with thegrowth of the Party. 
 Comrade Trotsky completely misin-terpreted the main idea of my book, What Is to Be Done? , when he spoke about the Party not being a conspiratorial organisation (many others too raised this objection). 
 He forgot that in my book I propose a number of various typesof organisations, from the most secret and most exclusiveto comparatively broad and “loose” ( lose ) organisations. 
 * He forgot that the Party must be only the vanguard, the leader of the vast masses of the working class, the whole (or nearly the whole) of which works “under the control and direction” of the Party organisations, but the whole ofwhich does not and should not belong to a “party”. 
 Now letus see what conclusions Comrade Trotsky arrives at in con-sequence of his fundamental mistake. 
 He has told us herethat if rank after rank of workers were arrested, and all the workers were to declare that they did not belong to the Party, our Party would be a strange one indeed! Is it notthe other way round? Is it not Comrade Trotsky’s argumentthat is strange? He regards as something sad that which a revo-lutionary with any experience at all would only rejoiceat. 
 If hundreds and thousands of workers who were arrested for taking part in strikes and demonstrations did not prove *See present edition, Vol. 
 5. 
— Ed. 
 to be members of Party organisations, it would only show that we have good organisations, and that we are fulfilling our task of keeping a more or less limited circle of leaders secret and of drawing the broadest possible masses into themovement. 
 The root of the mistake made by those who stand for Martov’s formulation is that they not only ignore one of themain evils of our Party life, but even sanctify it. 
 The evil is that, at a time when political discontent is almost uni-versal, when conditions require our work to be carriedon in complete secrecy, and when most of our activitieshave to be confined to limited, secret circles and evento private meetings, it is extremely difficult, almost im-possible in fact, for us to distinguish those who only talk from those who do the work. 
 There is hardly another country in the world where the jumbling of these two categoriesis as common and as productive of such boundless confusionand harm as in Russia. 
 We are suffering sorely from thisevil not only among the intelligentsia, but also among theworking class, and Comrade Martov’s formulation sanc-tions it. 
 This formulation necessarily tends to make Party members of all and sundry ; Comrade Martov himself was forced to admit this, although with a reservation: “Yes,if you like,” he said. 
 But that is precisely what we do notlike! And that is precisely why we are so adamant in ouropposition to Martov’s formulation. 
 It would be better if ten who do work should not call themselves Party members (real workers don’t hunt after titles!) than that one whoonly talks should have the right and opportunity to be aParty member. 
 That is a principle which seems to me irre-futable, and which compels me to fight against Martov. 
 Theobjection has been presented to me that we confer no rights on Party members, and that therefore there can be no abuses. 
 This kind of objection is quite untenable: if we do notstate what particular rights a Party member enjoys, pleasenote that neither do we say that there is to be any restric-tion on the rights of Party members. 
 That is point one. 
Secondly—and this is the main point—irrespective even of rights, we must not forget that every Party member is responsible for the Party, and that the Party is responsible for every one of its members . 
 In view of the conditions in which we have to carry on our political activities, in view of the present rudimentary state of real political organisa-tion, it would be simply dangerous and harmful to grant the right of membership to people who are not membersof a Party organisation and to make the Party responsiblefor people who do not belong to an organisation (perhapsdeliberately). 
 Comrade Martov was horrified at the ideathat one who is not a member of a Party organisation will have no right to declare in court that he is a Party mem-ber, however energetically he may have done his work. 
 Thatdoes not frighten me. 
 On the contrary, serious harm wouldbe done if a person who calls himself a Party member, eventhough he does not belong to any Party organisation, wereto behave unworthily in court. 
 It would be impossible to deny that such a person was working under the control and direction of the organisation—impossible because of thevery vagueness of the term. 
 Actually—and there can be nodoubt about this—the words “under the control and direc-tion” will mean that there will be neither control nor di-rection . 
 The Central Committee will never be able to ex-ercise real control over all who do the work but do not belong to organisations. 
 It is our task to place actual con-trol in the hands of the Central Committee. 
 It is our taskto safeguard the firmness, consistency, and purity of ourParty. 
 We must strive to raise the title and the significanceof a Party member higher, higher and still higher—and I therefore oppose Martov’s formulation. 
 22 SPEECH AT THE ELECTION OF THE EDITORIAL BOARD OF ISKRA August 7 (20)144 Comrades! Martov’s speech was so strange that I find myself obliged to protest emphatically against his presen-tation of the question. 
 In the first place, let me remind youthat Martov’s protest against the editorial board electionitself, his refusal, and that of his colleagues, to work on the editorial board which is to be elected, is in crying contradic-tion to what we all said (Martov included) when Iskra was recognised as the Party organ. 
 The objection was thenpresented to us that such recognition was pointless becauseyou cannot endorse a mere title without endorsing the edi-torial board; and Comrade Martov himself explained to the objectors that this was not true , that it was a definite po-litical trend that was being endorsed, that the composi-tion of the editorial board was not being predetermined in any way, and that the election of the editors would comeup later under Point 24 * of our Tagesordnung ** Comrade Martov, therefore, had no right whatever now to speak about the recognition of Iskra being limited. 
 Comrade Martov’s statement that his inclusion in the trio without his old col-leagues of the editorial board would cast a slur on his wholepolitical reputation is therefore indicative only of an as-tounding confusion of political ideas . 
 To adopt this point of view is to deny the right of the Congress to hold new *During the Congress it was changed to Point 18 on the agen-da. 
— Ed. 
 **Agenda. 
— Ed. 
 elections, make new appointments of any kind, and change the composition of its authorised boards. 
 The Organising Committee provides an example of the confusion created by such an approach. 
 We expressed to the Organising Committeethe complete confidence and gratitude of the Congress but atthe same time we ridiculed the very idea of the Congresshaving no right to examine the internal relations of theOrganising Committee, and rejected every supposition that the old composition of the Organising Committee would be an embarrassment to an “uncomradely” change of thiscomposition and the formation of a new Central Committee of any elements we pleased. 
 I repeat: Comrade Martov’sviews on the permissibility of electing part of the old board reflect an extreme confusion of political ideas. 
 I now come to the question of the two trios. 
 Comrade Martov said that this whole plan for two trios was thework of one person, of one member of the editorial board(that it was my plan, in fact), and that no one else wasresponsible for it. 
 I categorically protest against this asser-tion and declare that it is simply untrue . 
 Let me remind Comrade Martov that several weeks before the Congress I plainly told him and another member of the editorial boardthat at the Congress I would demand the free election of the editorial board. 
 I gave up this plan only because Comrade Martov himself suggested to me the more convenient plan of electing two trios . 
 I thereupon formulated this plan on paper and sent it first of all to Comrade Martov himself, who returned it to me with some corrections—here it is, Ihave the very copy, with Martov’s corrections in red ink. 
Many of the comrades later saw this plan dozens of times,all the members of the editorial board saw it too, and no one at any time formally protested against it. 
 I say “for-mally” because, if I am not mistaken, Comrade Axelrod on one occasion dropped some private remark to the effect thathe did not sympathise with the plan. 
 But it is obvious thatfor a protest the editorial board required something morethan a private remark. 
 It was not without reason that, evenbefore the Congress, the editorial board adopted a formal decision to invite a definite seventh person, so that, should it be necessary to make a collective statement at the Con-gress, a firm decision could be made—which we so often failed to reach on our board of six. 
 And all the members of the editorial board know that the addition of a seventh permanent member to the board of six was a mat-ter of constant concern to us for a very long time. 
 Andso, I repeat, the election of “two trios” was a perfectly nat-ural solution, and one which I incorporated in my planwith the knowledge and consent of Comrade Martov. 
 And on many subsequent occasions, Comrade Martov, together with Comrade Trotsky and others, at a number of private meetings of Iskra supporters, advocated this system of electing two trios. 
 However, in correcting Martov’s statement about the private character of the plan for “two trios,” I have no in-tention of denying Martov’s assertion of the “political significance” of the step we took in not endorsing the old editorial board. 
 On the contrary, I fully and unreservedlyagree with Comrade Martov that this step is of great polit-ical significance—only not the significance which Martovascribes to it. 
 He said that it was an act in a struggle forinfluence on the Central Committee in Russia. 
 I go far-ther than Martov. 
 The whole activity of Iskra as a separate group has hitherto been a struggle for influence; but now it is a matter of something more, namely, the organisation-al consolidation of this influence, and not only a struggle for it. 
 How profoundly Comrade Martov and I differ politi-cally on this point is shown by the fact that he blames me for this wish to influence the Central Committee, whereas I count it to my credit that I strove and still strive to consolidate this influence by organisational means. 
 Itappears that we are even talking in different languages!What would be the point of all our work, of all our efforts,if they ended in the same old struggle for influence, and not in its complete acquisition and consolidation? Yes, Comrade Martov is absolutely right: the step we have takenis undoubtedly a major political step showing that one of the trends now to be observed has been chosen for the futurework of our Party. 
 And I am not at all frightened by thedreadful words a “state of siege in the Party”, “emergency laws against particular individuals and groups”, etc. 
 We not only can but we must create a “state of siege” in rela-tion to unstable and vacillating elements, and all our Party Rules, the whole system of centralism now endorsed by the Congress are nothing but a “state of siege” in respect to the numerous sources of political vagueness . 
 It is special laws, even if they are emergency laws, that are needed as measuresagainst vagueness, and the step taken by the Congress hascorrectly indicated the political direction to be followed, byhaving created a firm basis for such laws and such measures. 
 23 SPEECH ON THE ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE STUDENT YOUTH August 10 (23) It is not only by reactionaries that the expression “false friends” is used; we know from the example of the liberalsand Socialist-Revolutionaries that such “false friends” doexist. 
 It is these false friends that are trying to persuadethe youth that they have no need to distinguish betweendifferent trends. 
 We, on the contrary, consider it the main task to develop an integral revolutionary world outlook, and the practical task for the future is to get the youth,when they are organising themselves, to apply to our com-mittees. 
 AN ERA OF REFORMS Yes, we are undoubtedly passing through an era of re-forms, strange as these words may sound when applied topresent-day Russia. 
 There is stagnation in all spheres of home policy, except where these are linked up with the fight against the internal enemy, and despite this—or, to bemore exact, precisely because of this—constant and un-ceasing efforts are being made to institute reforms, attemptsat reforms in the sphere of the most critical and mostsalient social and political relations. 
 The proletariat, which is awakening to class-conscious life, came forward fairly long ago as the real, the main, as the only irreconcilablefoe of our autocratic police regime. 
 However, an enemysuch as the foremost social class cannot be fought withforce alone, even with the most ruthless, best organised, andmost thorough-going force. 
 Such an enemy makes itself reckoned with and compels concessions, which, though they are always insincere, always half-hearted, often spuriousand illusory, and usually hedged round with more or lesssubtly hidden traps, are nevertheless concessions, reformsthat mark a whole era. 
 Of course, these are not the reformsthat denote a down-grade in political development, when a crisis has passed, the storm has abated, and those who have been left masters of the situation proceed to giveeffect to their own programme, or (as also happens) theprogramme taken over from their opponents. 
 No, these arethe reforms of an up-grade, when ever greater masses arebeing drawn into struggle, when the crisis is still in the offing, when every clash, in which hundreds of victims are carried off the field of battle, produces thousands of newfighters who are even grimmer, bolder, and better trained. 
 Such reforms are always foretokens and precursors of revolution. 
 The recent measures partly effected and partly only projected by the tsarist government are indubitably of this nature, viz. 
, the Bill on workers’ mutual aid soci-eties (this Bill has not been made public by the governmentand is known only from reports in the liberal bourgeoisOsvobozhdeniye ), the laws on compensation for injured workers and on factory stewards. 
 It is on this latter law that we now propose to dwell in greater detail. 
 The gist of the new law is that, under certain circum-stances, the workers may have the right to representation intheir relations with the employers, the right to certainrudiments of organisation. 
 These rights are circumscribedby an incredible number of police regulations, restrictions, and qualifications. 
 And indeed, it is first of all necessary to take into consideration that, according to the new law,the right of the workers to representation depends on theconsent and initiative of the factory management and onthe permission of the Boards for Factory and Mining Affairs. 
The right to representation may be accorded the workers by the factory owners, but they are in no way bound to do so under this law, besides which the Factory Board may refuseto permit representation, even if requested by the employer,on any grounds or even on no grounds whatever. 
 Hence,from the very outset, the right of the workers to representa-tion has been completely, unconditionally, and conclusively left to the discretion of the employers and the police . 
 If it appears advantageous and desirable to the employers andthe police, they may set up workers’ representativebodies (on a very restricted basis)—that is the substance ofthe reform. 
 I would add parenthetically that the law makesno mention whatever of workers’ representation at govern-ment factories: at privately owned factories the work-ers’ representatives may turn out to be new agents, new factory watchmen controlled by the police; at govern-ment factories there is always a sufficient number of agentsand watchmen! The police do not ask for a reform in thisfield—hence, reform is not necessary here. 
 Further, workers’ representation itself has been given an ugly twist. 
 The workers are to be disunited, dividedinto categories ; the regulations governing the division into categories are subject to approval by the governor , as are all regulations in general that have any bearing on the or-ganisation of representative bodies under the new law. 
 The manufacturers and the police can and of course willarrange the categories in such a way as to hinder workers’solidarity and unity in every way possible, rouse and in-flame discord not only among the various crafts and shopsbut also among workers of different nationalities, sex, age groups, degrees of skill, wage levels, etc. 
, etc. 
 Workers’ representation can be and is useful to the workers exclusive-ly in their uniting in a single body, for their unity, organ-isation and solidarity are the only source of strengthto the downtrodden, oppressed wage-slaves of our civilisa-tion, ground down as they are by toil. 
 The tsarist autocracy wants to give the workers representation of such a kind and on such terms as to disunite them in every way possible and thus make them powerless. 
 The police-established categories will have to elect candidates for the post of steward on the basis of detailed police rules, the number of candidates to be designated by the police. 
 The factory management will endorse one of the candidates at its own discretion, while the governor alwayshas the right to remove any steward who “does not meetthe requirements of his office ”, as the law puts it. 
 This whole police scheme is not so very subtle! The “office” of a steward obviously consists in being useful to the police, in being acceptable to them. 
 The law says nothing about this, for such conditions are not spoken of; they areengineered . 
 And it is more than simple to engineer this, once the governor, who is the head of the local police, is giventhe unrestricted right to remove an undesirable steward. 
Once again: would it not be more correct to call such a factory steward a factory watchman? The police can decide on the election of a very large number of candidates, ofwhom only one will be endorsed; for example, each categoryof say 50 to 100 people will be told to vote for 5 or 10 candi-dates. 
 Will it not be possible in some cases to turn thelist of elected candidates into a list of people to be kept under special surveillance or even subject to arrest? For-merly such lists were drawn up only by spies; but now willthey not perhaps sometimes be drawn up by the workers themselves? To the police there is nothing dangerous or even inconvenient in a list of candidates, since it is always the worst of them that will be endorsed, or no one at all, and new elections will be ordered. 
 In its effort to have the factory stewards meet the re-quirements of their police “office”, the new law (like themajority of the Russian laws) has even overdone things. 
Candidates must not be under 25 years of age. 
 The original Bill proposed a minimum age of 21; higher government circles deemed it more cautious and statesmanlike to raiseit by four years so as to eliminate in advance “the mostunruly elements of the industrial population”, which, “ac-cording to information in possession of the Department ofPolice, are within the 17-20 age group” (from the expla-natory motives of the Ministry of Finance, published in abridged form in Vestnik Finansov , and in full in Osvobozh-deniye ). 
 But that is not all. 
 The factory management and the police may, in each particular instance, i. 
e. 
, for eachseparate establishment, demand, firstly, a higher minimumage and, secondly, a certain length of service of the partic-ular worker in the factory. 
 It is, for example, possible that they may demand a minimum age of 40 and a servicerecord of not less than 15 years as a condition for the rightto be elected as candidate for the post of steward! Thereis one thing, however, to which the authors of this law,who so zealously safeguarded the interests of the police, did not apparently give sufficient thought: under such conditions will workers be at all eager to accept this “post”of steward? After all, the steward will be placed almostas much at the arbitrary disposal of the police as a merevillage constable. 
 The steward may be turned into anordinary messenger boy, conveying the orders and explana-tions of the factory management to the workers. 
 The stew-ard will undoubtedly be required to render sheer spyingservices and to give accounts of the meetings of the workers’categories which are called by him and for the orderlyconduct of which he is responsible. 
 And yet, while pro-viding for rules about stewards being released from work to perform their duties, the law maintains a modest silence as to whether the stewards are to receive remuneration,and if so from whom. 
 Do the authors of this law really think that stewards who have been released from work will not demand pay from the factory for this “free” time? Would they really serve as stewards, at the will of the manufacturers and governors, out of sheer love for thesetrue friends of the working people? The desire to turn stewards into factory watchmen is particularly evident also in Clause 3 of the new law: stew-ards are recognised as being representatives empowered to speak for the workers’ categories only on matters con-cerning fulfilment of the terms of hire. 
 When it comes to changing the terms of hire the stewards have no right even to hint at this! Fine workers’ “representatives” indeed. 
 And how absurd this ruling is, even from the standpoint ofthe authors of the law, who wanted to make it easier “to ascertain the true desires and needs of the workers” “par-ticularly at a time when discontent and unrest have alreadyarisen”. 
 In nine cases out of ten, unrest is the result ofthis very demand to change the terms of hire, and to bar the stewards from taking a hand in this matter is tanta-mount to reducing their role to practically nil. 
 The authors of the law have become entangled in one of the countless contradictions of the autocracy, for to accord the workers’representatives (their genuine representatives, and notrepresentatives by permission of the police) the right todemand changes in the terms of hire would mean grantingthem freedom of speech and inviolability of the person. 
 In general there can be no question of regarding the factory stewards as genuine representatives of the workers. 
Representatives must be elected only by the workers, with-out any endorsement by the police. 
 A representative mustbe removed as soon as the workers who elected him passa vote of non-confidence in him. 
 A representative must render an account to a meeting of the workers whenever they demand this of him. 
 According to our law, however, thesteward alone is authorised to convene the workers of the category which has elected him, and, besides, this mustbe done when and where the factory management wants it. 
In other words, the steward is not obliged to call the workers together, and the management does not have to provide the time and the place. 
 It would perhaps be more expedientnot to talk about workers’ representation at all than to annoy the workers with this mere pretence of representa-tion. 
 Workers’ meetings inspire the autocracy with such fear (and a justified fear) that it categorically bans joint meetingsof the various categories. 
 “For the discussion of matters con-cerning several categories,” the new law decrees, “the stewardsof these categories alone shall meet. 
” For the capitalists,and for the police government which protects them, it would indeed be extremely advantageous to set up numer-ically small categories of foremen, office employees, andhighly paid workers, to set up numerically large catego-ries of unskilled workers and ordinary workers—and thento permit meetings only of the stewards of different cate-gories. 
 But this means reckoning without the real master : the class-conscious proletariat is the master of its own fate and it will spurn these miserable police partitions inwhich they would segregate it. 
 The workers will meettogether to discuss their own affairs and will organisesecret meetings of their own, genuine, Social-Democraticstewards, despite all bans. 
 But if this miserable reform to such a degree infects the embryo of workers’ representation with a spirit of policeespionage, would it not be better for the class-consciousworkers to have nothing whatever to do with the electionof factory stewards or the meetings of the “categories”?We believe that it would not. 
 Refusal to take an active part in present-day political life, however disgusting it may be, is the tactic of anarchists, not of Social-Democrats. 
We shall and must be able to promote a widespread struggleof the workers against every loathsome trap in the newlaw, against every spying manoeuvre made with the helpof the new law—and this fight will rouse the most back-ward workers, and will develop the political consciousness of all who take part in the Russian workers-police-gendarme-spy “representation”. 
 The Zubatov meetings corrupted work-ers’ minds far more and much more directly than theirminds will be corrupted by stewards who kowtow to theauthorities, and yet we sent to those meetings class-conscious, workers who themselves learned and taught others, and yet this entire Zubatov epic ended in a miserable fiasco, afterworking to the advantage of Social-Democracy far more than to that of the autocracy: the Odessa events145 have left no shadow of doubt on that score. 
 The autocracy is beginning to talk about workers’ meet-ings. 
 Let us take advantage of this for the widest propa-ganda and agitation in support of the Social-Democraticdemands for the full freedom of meetings and assembly. 
The autocracy is beginning to talk of elections; let us takeadvantage of this to acquaint the working masses with the meaning of elections, with all systems of elections, with all the tricks of the police during elections. 
 And letthe workers know this not only from books and talks, butfrom practice, from the example of the Russian, police-con-trolled elections, and by participating in these elections, * the class-conscious workers will teach ever greater masses to carry on election agitation, conduct meetings, defend their demands both at meetings and before the stewards,and organise a constant watch over the activities of thestewards. 
 The autocracy is talking about workers’ repre-sentation. 
 Let us take advantage of this to spread correctideas about genuine representation. 
 Only a free workers ’ union , with members in many factories and many cities, can represent the workers. 
 Factory representation, bodiesrepresenting the workers at each factory separately, can-not satisfy the workers even in the West, even in the freestates. 
 The leaders of the Social-Democratic Labour Party,in Germany, for example, have frequently protested against factory representation. 
 And this can be readily under-stood, for the yoke of capital is too heavy, and the rightto dismiss workers—the sacred right of capitalist freecontract—will always render the representative body of the workers in each individual factory powerless. 
 Only aworkers’ union which organises the workers of many factories and many localities will do away with dependence of the workers’ representatives on the individual factory owner. 
Only a workers’ union will provide all the means of strugglethat can at all possibly exist under capitalism. 
 But free-workers’ unions are out of the question unless we have po-litical liberty , inviolability of the person, freedom of assembly *Naturally, organised workers should in no case be elected to the post of steward; suitable people from among the unorganised massesshould be put forward as candidates. 
 and meetings, and the right freely to elect deputies to a national assembly. 
 Without political liberty all forms of workers’ repre-sentation will remain a miserable fraud, and the proletariatwill remain in prison as hitherto, without light, with-out air, and without the elbow-room it needs for the struggleto attain its complete emancipation. 
 In this prison the gov-ernment is now cutting a tiny aperture instead of a win-dow, and in such a manner that this aperture is of more use to the gendarmes and spies who guard the prisonersthan it is to the prisoners themselves. 
 And this is thereform that the butchers of the Russian people want to passoff as a benefaction of the tsarist government! But theRussian working class will use this aperture to build up fresh energy for battle; it will raze to the ground the walls of the accursed all-Russian prison and win for itself freeclass representation in a bourgeois-democratic state. 
 Iskra , No. 
 46, August 15, 1903 Published according to the Iskra text THE LATEST WORD IN BUNDIST NATIONALISM The Foreign Committee of the Bund has just issued a bulletin containing a report on the Fifth Congress of theBund, which took place in June (Old Style). 
 Preponder-ant among its resolutions are the “draft Rules” on the posi-tion of the Bund in the Party. 
 This draft is highly instruc-tive, and from the angle of definiteness and “resoluteness”of content, nothing better could be desired. 
 Strictly speaking,the first paragraph of the draft is so striking as to reduce allthe others to mere explanation or even to entirely useless ballast. 
 “The Bund,” declares § 1, “is a federative [italics ours] section of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Par-ty. 
” Federation presupposes an agreement between separate, entirely independent units, which define their mutualrelations only by voluntary consent of the sides concerned. 
It is not surprising, therefore, that the “draft Rules” speak repeatedly of the “ contracting parties ” (§§3, 8, 12). 
 It is not surprising that, on the basis of this draft, theParty Congress is not given the right to alter, supplement or delete Rules relating to a section of the Party. 
 Neither is it surprising that the Bund reserves to itself “representa-tion” in the Central Committee of the Party and permits this Central Committee of the Party to address itself to the Jewish proletariat and to communicate with indi-vidual sections of the Bund “ only with the consent of the Central Committee of the Bund ”. 
 All this logically stems from the concept of “federation”, from the concept of “con-tracting parties”, and had the Fifth Congress of the Bund simply resolved that the Bund is to be constituted as an in-dependent Social-Democratic national (or, perhaps, nation-alist Social-Democratic?) party, it would have saved itself (and others) much time, much labour, and much paper. 
 On the one hand, it would have been clear at once without any circumlocution that an independent, separate party could determine its relations with other parties only as a“contracting party” and only on the basis of “mutual con-sent”. 
 There would have been no need to enumerate everyindividual case when such consent will be required (andit is impossible in fact to enumerate all such cases, while to give an incomplete list, as the Bund does, is to open the door to a host of misunderstandings). 
 There would havebeen no need to do violence to logic and conscience bycalling an agreement between two independent units Ruleson the position of one section of the party. 
 This apparentlyseemly and suitable name (“Rules on the Position of the Bund in the Party”) is all the more false in essence since the entire Party has in fact not yet restored its full organisation-al unity, while the Bund comes out as an already unitedsection, which wishes to take advantage of the shortcomingsin the general organisation in order to get still farther awayfrom the whole, in order to try and split up this whole into small parts for all time . 
 On the other hand, a straightforward treatment of the matter would have relieved the authors of the notoriousdraft Rules of the necessity to introduce clauses providingfor rights already possessed by every organised section of the Party, every district organisation, every committee and every group, e. 
g. 
, the right to solve, in accordance with the Party programme, general problems on which Partycongresses have not adopted decisions. 
 To write Rulesincluding clauses such as these is simply ridiculous. 
 Let us now appraise in essence the stand taken by the Bund. 
 Once it has stepped on to the inclined plane of nation-alism, the Bund (if it did not wish to renounce its basic mistake) was naturally and inevitably bound to arriveat the formation of a particular Jewish party. 
 And thisis precisely the direct object of § 2 of the Rules, whichgrants the Bund the monopoly of representing the Jewish proletariat. 
 According to this paragraph, the Bund is in the Party as its (the Jewish proletariat’s) sole (italics ours) representative. 
 The activities of the Bund and the organ-isation of the Bund are not to be restricted by any territorial limits. 
 Consequently, complete separation and demarcation of the Jewish and non-Jewish proletariat of Russia is not only here effected to the end with absolute consistency, but is endorsed by what may be called a notarial agreement, by“Rules”, by a “basic” law (see § 12 of the draft). 
 Such “out-rageous” facts as the audacious appeal of the EkaterinoslavCommittee of the Party to the Jewish workers directly, notthrough the medium of the Bund (which had no special or-ganisation in Ekaterinoslav at the time!), should henceforth become impossible, according to the idea of the new draft. 
However few the number of Jewish workers may be in a givenlocality, however far away this locality may be from thecentres of the Bundist organisation, no section of the Party,not even the Central Committee of the Party, dare address itself to the Jewish proletariat without the consent of the Central Committee of the Bund! It is hard to believe that sucha proposal could have been made, so monstrous is this demandfor monopoly, especially in our Russian conditions, but§§ 2 and 8 (footnote) of the draft Rules leave no doubtswhatever on this score. 
 The desire of the Bund to shift still farther away from the Russian comrades is apparent not only in each clause of the draft, but is also expressedin other resolutions of the congress. 
 For example, the FifthCongress has resolved to publish once a month Posledniye Izvestia , issued by the Foreign Committee of the Bund, “in the form of a newspaper which would explain the pro-grammatic and tactical position of the Bund”. 
 We shall be looking forward with impatience and interest to anexplanation of this position. 
 The congress has annulled the resolution of the Fourth Congress on work in the south. 
It is known that the Fourth Congress of the Bund decidedthat “ separate committees of the Bund shall not be set up ” (italicised by the Bund) in the towns and cities in the south, where the Jewish organisations are included in theParty committees. 
 The reversal of this decision is a big steptowards further isolation, a direct challenge to the comradesfrom the south, who have been working and wanted to workamong the Jewish proletariat, while remaining inseparably connected with the local proletariat as a whole . 
 “He who says A must say B”; one who has adopted the standpoint of nation-alism naturally arrives at the desire to erect a Chinese Wall around his nationality, his national working-class movement; he is unembarrassed even by the fact that it would mean build-ing separate walls in each city, in each little town and vil-lage, unembarrassed even by the fact that by his tactics ofdivision and dismemberment he is reducing to nil t he gr e at call for the rallying and unity of the proletarians of all na-tions, all races and all languages. 
 And what bitter mockerysounds in the resolution of the same Fifth Congress of the Bund on pogroms, which expresses the “confidence that only the joint struggle of the proletarians of all nationalities will abolish the conditions giving rise to events similarto those at Kishinev” 146 (italics ours). 
 How false these words about joint struggle sound when we are treated at the verysame time to “Rules” which not only keep the joint fighters far apart , but strengthen this separation and alienation through organisational means! I should like very much togive the Bund nationalists a piece of advice: learn from thoseOdessa workers who went on a joint strike and attended jointmeetings and joint demonstrations, without first asking (ah,the audacity!) for the “consent” of the Central Committee of the Bund for an appeal to the Jewish nation, and who reas-sured the shopkeepers with the words (see Iskra , No. 
 45): “Have no fear, have no fear, this is not Kishinev for you,what we want is something else, we have neither Jews norRussians in our midst, we are all workers , life is equally hard for us all. 
” Let the comrades of the Bund ponder over these words, if it is not too late; let them think well about whither they are going! Iskra , No.

 Lenin played a prominent part in drawing up the draft programme ofthe R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 As early as 1895-96, while in prison, Lenin wrote the “Draft and Explanation of a Programme for the Social-Democratic Party”(see present edition, Vol. 
 2, pp. 
 93-121); at the end of 1899, whilein exile in Siberia, he prepared a new draft programme (see presentedition, Vol. 
 4, pp. 
 227-54). 
 When he began publication of Iskra , Lenin considered its most important task to be the struggle toachieve and consolidate the ideological unity of Russian Social-Democracy and to embody this unity in the Party programme. 
“The discussion of questions of theory and policy,” he wrote, “willbe connected with the drafting of a Party programme...” (see pres-ent edition, Vol. 
 4, “Draft of a Declaration of the Editorial Boardof Iskra and Zarya ”, p. 
 324). 
 The question of drawing up a draft of the Party programme became particularly acute in the summer of 1901: “They havewritten to us from Russia that there is increasing talk of a con-gress,” V. 
 I. 
 Lenin wrote to P. 
 B. 
 Axelrod on July 9, 1901. 
 “Thisonce again impels us to think of a programme. 
 The publicationof a draft programme is extremely necessary and would be of tre-mendous importance” (see present edition, Vol. 
 36, pp. 
 87-88). 
On Lenin’s suggestion, the original draft of the theoretical partof the programme was written by G. 
 V. 
 Plekhanov. 
 At a conference of the Iskra Editorial Board held in Munich in January 1902, Lenin sharply criticised Plekhanov’s draft;he made over 30 notes, pointing out a series of propositions in thedraft that were incorrect in principle (see pp. 
 17-24 of this volume). 
Under the influence of criticism by Lenin and other members ofthe Editorial Board, Plekhanov rewrote the first two paragraphsof his draft, but he did not agree with most of the other notes andproposals. 
 During discussion of Plekhanov’s draft by the Iskra Editorial Board, big differences of opinion were revealed; one ofthe most serious was evoked by Lenin’s proposal to begin theprogramme by pointing to the development of capitalism in Rus-sia; in notes written after the conference Lenin wrote: “The questionwhether or not to begin by pointing to Russia has been left open(3 votes in favour and 3 against). 
” ( Lenin Miscellany II , 1924, p. 
 15. 
) 2Convinced that Plekhanov’s draft of the theoretical part of the programme was unacceptable, Lenin set about writing his own draft. 
 The initial version of Lenin’s draft (in the correspond-ence of the members of the Iskra Editorial Board—“Frey’s draft”) was written by January 25 (February 7), 1902; Lenin completed work on his draft by February 18 (March 3), 1902 (see pp. 
 25-31 and 32 of this volume). 
 Simultaneously Plekhanov was also working on his second draft programme of the R. 
S. 
D.

 This too came in for serious critical analysis by Lenin (see pp. 
 35-55 and 56-58 of this volume). 
 To co-ordinate Lenin’s and Plekhanov’s drafts of the programme and draw up a joint draft programme of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 the Iskra Editorial Board set up a “Co-ordinating” Committee. 
 In its work this Committee took Plekhanov’s draft as a basis. 
 However, as a result of Lenin’s insistent demands, a number of very important propositions were included in the Committee’s draft: the thesis of the ousting of small-scale production by large-scale production replaced Plekhanov’s indefinite and vague for-mulation; a definition more precise than in Plekhanov’s draft was given of the purely proletarian character of the Party; the thesis of the dictatorship of the proletariat as an essential con-dition of the socialist revolution became a point of the highest importance in the programme. 
 Lenin got acquainted with the Committee’s draft programme on April 12, 1902, while travelling from Munich to London, and he wrote his remarks on it during the journey (see pp. 
 59-70 of this volume) At the conference of the Iskra Editorial Board held in Zurich on April 14, 1902, which Lenin did not attend, the general edi-torial draft of the programme was confirmed: its theoretical part (the Committee’s) and the practical Part (already agreed to by all the members of the Iskra Editorial Board in early March 1902). 
 Most of the notes, amendments, and additions proposed by Lenin were taken into account by the authors of the draft programme, when it was discussed at the Zurich conference.

 15 The Erfurt Programme of the German Social-Democratic Party was adopted in October 1891 at the Congress in Erfurt. 
 Compared with the Gotha Programme (1875), it was a step forward, being based on the Marxist doctrine that the capitalist mode of pro-duction must inevitably yield place to the socialist; it stressed the need for the working class to wage a political struggle, indi-3 4 5 6 7 8cating the party’s role as the organiser of this struggle, etc. 
 How-ever, the Erfurt Programme, too, contained serious concessions to opportunism. 
 It was extensively criticised by Frederick Engels (“Criticism of the Draft Social-Democratic Programme of 1891”), this being in essence a criticism of the opportunism of the entire Second International, for whose parties the Erfurt Programme was a kind of model. 
 However, the leadership of German Social-Democ-racy concealed Engels’ criticism from the party rank and file, while his most important remarks were ignored when the final text of the programme was drawn up.

 Lenin and G.

 This form of bondage was retained even after serfdom had been abolished, and remained in force until 1906.

 36 Russkiye Vedomosti (Russian Recorder)—a newspaper published in Moscow from 1863 onwards; it expressed the views of the moder-ate liberal intelligentsia, and insisted on the need for reforms that would transform Russia into a constitutional monarchy. 
 Among its contributors in the 1880s and 1890s were the democratic writers M. 
 Y. 
 Saltykov-Shchedrin, G.

 Uspensky, and V. 
 G. 
 Korolenko. 
 It also published items written by liberal Narodniks. 
 In 1905 it became the organ of the Right wing of the bourgeois Constitu-tional-Democratic (Cadet) Party. 
 Lenin said that Russkiye Vedo-mosti was “a unique combination of Right Cadetism and Narodnik overtones” (see present edition, Vol. 
 19, p. 
 135). 
 In 1918 the pub-lication was closed down together with other counter-revolutionary newspapers.

 47 The Mountain (la Montagne) and the Gironde were the names of two political groupings of the bourgeoisie at the time of the French bourgeois revolution of the end of the eighteenth century. 
 The Mountain—the Jacobins—was the name given to the more deter-mined representatives of the revolutionary class of the time—the bourgeoisie—who advocated the abolition of absolutism and feudal-ism. 
 Unlike the Jacobins, the Girondists wavered between revo-lution and counter-revolution, and entered into deals with the monarchy. 
 Lenin called the opportunist trend in Social-Democracy the “socialist Gironde,” and the revolutionary Social-Democrats— “proletarian Jacobins,” the “Mountain”.

 50 Die Neue Zeit (New Times)—a theoretical magazine of the German Social-Democratic Party, published in Stuttgart from 1883 to 1923. 
 Before October 1917, it was edited by Karl Kautsky, later by Heinrich Cunow. 
 Some of the writings of Karl Marx and Fre-derick Engels were first published in Die Neue Zeit : “Critique of the Gotha Programme” by Karl Marx (in No. 
 18, 1890-91) “A Critique of the Draft Social-Democratic Programme of 1891” by Frederick Engels (in No. 
 1, 1901-02) and others. 
 Engels constantly helped the Editorial Board of the magazine with his advise, and not infrequently criticised it for allowing deviations from Marxism to appear in it. 
 Contributors to Die Neue Zeit included prominent leaders of the German and international working-class movement at the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth cen-turies, such as August Bebel, Wilhelm Liebknecht, Rosa Luxem-burg, Franz Mehring, Clara Zetkin, G. 
 V. 
 Plekhanov, Paul Lafar-14 15 16 17 18 19gue, and Victor Adler. 
 From the second half of the nineties, the periodical began systematically publishing article by revision-ists, including a series of articles by Eduard Bernstein entitled “Prob-lems of Socialism”, which opened the revisionists’ campaign against Marxism. 
 During the First World War the magazine adopted a Centrist, Kautskian position, in actual fact supporting the social-chauvinists.

 59 Zarya (Dawn)—a Marxist scientific and political magazine, was pub-lished in 1901-02 in Stuttgart by the Iskra Editorial Board Only four numbers (three books) of Zarya were issued: No. 
 1—in April 1901 (which actually appeared on March 23, New Style); No. 
 2-3— in December 1901; No. 
 4—in August 1902. 
 The tasks of Zarya were defined in the draft declaration of Iskra and Zarya which V. 
 I. 
 Lenin wrote in Russia (see present edition, Vol. 
 4, pp. 
 320-30). 
 However, when the question of joint publication of these organs abroad was discussed with the Eman-cipation of Labour group, it was decided to publish Zarya legally and Iskra illegally; consequently there was no mention of Zarya in the declaration of the Editorial Board of Iskra , a declaration published in October 1900. 
 Zarya criticised international and Russian revisionism, and defended the theoretical principles of Marxism. 
 It published V.

 Lenin’s writings: “Casual Notes”, “The Persecutors of the Zemstvo and the Hannibals of Liberalism”, “Messrs. 
 the ‘Critics’ on the Agrarian Question” (the first four chapters of “The Agrarian Question and ‘the Critics of Marx’”), “Review of Internal Affairs”, “The Agrarian Programme of Russian Social-Democracy” and also G.

 73 Socialist-Revolutionaries (S. 
R. 
s)—a petty-bourgeois party in Rus-sia, which arose at the end of 1901 and beginning of 1902 as a result of the union of Narodnik groups and circles. 
 The newspaper Revolutsionnaya Rossiya (Revolutionary Russia) (1900-05) and the magazine Vestnik Russkoi Revolutsii (Herald of the Russian Revolution) (1901-05) became its official organs. 
 The views of the Socialist-Revolutionaries were an eclectic mixture of the ideas of Narodism and revisionism, they tried, as Lenin put it, to patch up “the rents in the Narodnik ideas with bits of fashionable oppor-tunist ‘criticism’ of Marxism” (see present edition, Vol. 
 9, p. 
 310). 
 The Socialist-Revolutionaries did not see the class distinctions between proletariat and peasantry, glossed over the class differen-tiation and contradictions within the peasantry, and rejected the proletariat’s leading role in the revolution. 
 The tactic of individual terrorism which the Socialist-Revolutionaries advocated as a basic method of struggle against the autocracy caused great detriment to the revolutionary movement and made it difficult to organise the masses for the revolutionary struggle. 
 The agrarian programme of the Socialist-Revolutionaries envisaged the abolition of private ownership of the land and its transfer to the village communes on the basis of equalitarian tenure, and also the development of all forms of co-operatives. 
 There was nothing socialist in this programme, which the Socialist-Revolu-tionaries tried to present as a programme for “socialising the land”, since abolition of private ownership of the land, as Lenin pointed out, cannot of itself abolish the domination of capital and the poverty of the masses. 
 The struggle for the abolition of landlord ownership was the real, historically progressive content of the agrarian programme of the Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
 This demand objectively expressed the interests and aspirations of the peasantry at the stage of the bourgeois-democratic revolution. 
 The Bolshevik Party exposed the attempts of the Socialist-Revolutionaries to camouflage themselves as socialists, waged a stubborn struggle against the Socialist-Revolutionaries to gain influence over the peasantry, and laid bare the harmful consequences for the working-class movement of their tactic of individual terrorism. 
 At the same time, on definite conditions, the Bolsheviks concluded temporary agreements with the Socialist-Revolutiona-ries in the struggle against tsarism. 
 In the final analysis, the absence of class homogeneousness in the peasantry was responsible for the political and ideological instability and organisational confusion in the Socialist-Revolu-tionary party, and their constant vacillation between the liberal bourgeoisie and the proletariat. 
 There was a split in the Socialist-Revolutionary Party already in the years of the first Russian revo-lution: its Right wing formed the legal Labour Popular-Socialist Party, which held views close to those of the Constitutional-Democrats (Cadets); the “Left” wing took shape as the semi-anar-chist league of “Maximalists”. 
 During the Stolypin reaction, the Socialist-Revolutionary party experienced a complete ideological and organisational break-down, and the First World War saw most Socialist-Revolutionaries adopt the standpoint of social-chau-vinism. 
 20 21 22After the victory of the February bourgeois-democratic revo-lution in 1917, the Socialist-Revolutionaries, together with the Mensheviks and Cadets, were the mainstay of the counter-revo-lutionary bourgeois-landlord Provisional Government, of which leaders of the party (Kerensky, Avxentyev, Chernov) were mem-bers. 
 Influenced by the revolutionising of the peasantry, the “Left” wing of the Socialist-Revolutionaries founded an independent party of Left Socialist-Revolutionaries at the end of November 1917. 
 Striving to maintain their influence among the peasant masses, the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries formally recognised Soviet power and entered into an agreement with the Bolsheviks, but soon began a struggle against Soviet power. 
 During the years of foreign military intervention and civil war, the Socialist-Revolutionaries carried on counter-revolutionary subversive activ-ity, strongly supported the interventionists and whiteguard gener-als, took part in counter-revolutionary plots, and organised terrorist acts against leaders of the Soviet state and the Communist Party. 
 After the civil war, the Socialist-Revolutionaries continued their hostile activity against the Soviet state within the country and abroad among whiteguard émigrés.

 Petersburg from 1876 to 1918. 
 In the early nineties it passed into the hands of the liberal Narodniks headed by N. 
 K. 
 Mikhailovsky, and became the chief Narodnik organ. 
 As such, in 1893, it began a campaign against the Russian Social-Democrats. 
 In its distortion and falsification of Marxism, Russkoye Bogatstvo relied on the West-European revisionists; grouped round it were publicists who subsequently became prominent members of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, the “Popular Socialists” and the Trudovik (Labour) groups in the Dumas. 
 From 1906 Russkoye Bogatstvo became the organ of the semi-Cadet party of “Popular Socialists”. 
 The magazine changed its title several times: Sovremenniye Zapiski (Contemporary Notes), Sovremennost (Modern Times), Russkiye Zapiski (Russian Notes); from April 1917 it again became Russkoye Bogatstvo .

 75 According to the “Regulation Governing Redemption by Peasants Who Have Emerged from Serf Dependence...” adopted on Feb-ruary 19, 1861 the peasants were obliged to pay compensation to the landlords for land allotted to them. 
 In concluding the land redemption deal, the tsarist government paid over to the landlords the compensation money, which was regarded as a debt of the peasants payable over a period of 49 years. 
 The instalments of this debt, which the peasants paid annually, were called land redemp-tion payments, whose heavy and intolerable burden resulted in mass ruination and impoverishment of the peasants. 
 The land-lords’ former peasants alone paid the tsarist government about 2,000 million rubles at a time when the market price of the land which had passed to the peasants did not exceed 544 million rubles. 
 As all the peasants did not come under the land redemption scheme at once, but at various times until 1883, the land redemption pay-ments were to be completed only by 1932. 
 However, the peasant movement during the first Russian revolution of 1905-07 compelled the tsarist government to abolish land redemption payments as from January 1907.

 Dissatisfied with the “provisional regulations”, which put their organisations under constant administrative control, the students protested against this fresh act of governmental arbitrariness and refused to recognise these “regulations”. 
 Even liberal professors protested against the “provisional regulations”, which imposed on them the duty of police surveillance over the students.

 In veiled form the feuilleton gave a satirical character sketch of the last Romanovs: Nicholas I, Alexander II, Alexander III and his wife Maria Fyodo-rovna, and the then reigning Emperor Nicholas II. 
 For publication of this feuilleton the newspaper was suppressed and Amfiteatrov exiled to Minusinsk. 
 The article, “Messrs.

 82 Iskra (The Spark)—the first all-Russian illegal Marxist newspaper, which Lenin founded in 1900 and which played a decisive part in creating the revolutionary Marxist party of the working class. 
 Since police persecution made publication of a revolutionary newspaper impossible in Russia, Lenin, while in exile in Siberia, worked out all details of a plan for publishing one abroad. 
 When his exile ended (January 1900), he immediately set about giving effect to this plan. 
 In February 1900 Lenin conducted negotiations in St. 
 Petersburg with V. 
 I. 
 Zasulich, who had illegally come there from abroad, on participation of the Emancipation of Labour group in publishing an all-Russian Marxist newspaper. 
 In late March and early April 1900, the so-called “Pskov Conference” took place, at which V. 
 I. 
 Lenin, Y. 
 O. 
 Martov, A. 
 N. 
 Potresov and S. 
 I. 
 Radchenko, together with the “legal Marxists” P. 
 B. 
 Struve and M. 
 I. 
 Tugan-Baranovsky, discussed Lenin’s draft editorial declaration on the programme and tasks of an all-Russian newspaper (Iskra ) and a scientific-political magazine ( Zarya ). 
 Lenin visited a number of Russian cities (Moscow, St. 
 Petersburg, Riga, Smo-lensk, Nizhni-Novgorod, Ufa, Samara, Syzran), established con-nections with Social-Democratic groups and individual Social-Democrats and came to an agreement with them concerning support for the future Iskra . 
 When Lenin arrived in Switzerland in August 1900, he and A. 
 N. 
 Potresov had a conference with members of the Emancipation of Labour group concerning the programme and tasks of the newspaper and the magazine, possible contributors, and the composition and location of the editorial board. 
 These negotiations almost ended in a rupture (see present edition, Vol. 
 4, “How the ‘Spark’ Was Nearly Extinguished”, pp. 
 333-49), but finally agreement on all the questions at issue was reached with the Emancipation of Labour group. 
 The first number of Lenin’s Iskra was published in Leipzig in December 1900, while the following numbers came out in Mu-nich, in London from July 1902 and in Geneva from the spring of 1903. 
 Great assistance in organising the publication of Iskra was given by the German Social-Democrats Clara Zetkin, Adolf Braun and others, by the Polish revolutionary Julian Marchlewski who was living in Munich at the time, and by Harry Quelch, one of the leaders of the British Social-Democratic Federation. 
 The Editorial Board of Iskra consisted of V.

 Smidovich-Leman was the first secretary of the Editorial Board, to be later followed, from the spring of 1901, by N. 
 K. 
 Krup-skaya, who also dealt with all Iskra ’s correspondence with Russian Democratic organisations. 
 Iskra centred its attention on problems of the revolutionary struggle of the proletariat and all the working people of Russia against the tsarist autocracy, but it also paid great attention to leading international events, and chiefly to the international working-class movement. 
 In actual fact Lenin was the editor-in-chief and leader of Iskra ; he wrote articles on all the main questions of Party construction and the Russian proletariat’s class struggle. 
 Iskra became the centre for the unification of the Party’s forces, mobilising and training the Party’s cadres.

 groups and committees of Lenin’s Iskra trend were established, and in January 1902 a Russian Iskra organisation was set up at a conference of Iskra supporters held in Samara.

, which took place in July-August 1903. 
 When the Congress met, most local Social-Democratic organisations in Russia had adhered to Iskra , approved its tactics, programme, and organisational plan, and recognised it as their leading organ. 
 A special decision of the Congress noted the unique role of Iskra in the struggle for the Party, and appointed it the Central Organ of the R.

 The Second Congress ratified an editorial board consisting of Lenin, Plekhanov, and Martov. 
 Martov, who insisted on retention of all six former editors, refused to go on the board, despite the Party Congress decision, and Nos. 
 46-51 of the paper appeared under the editorship of Lenin and Plekhanov. 
 Later Plekhanov went over to the Menshevik position, and demanded that the Iskra Editorial Board should include all the old Menshevik editors rejected by the Congress. 
 Lenin could not agree to this, and on October 19 (November 1), 1903, he left the Iskra Editorial Board. 
 He was co-opted into the Central Committee and from there conducted a struggle against the Menshevik opportunists. 
 No. 
 52 of Iskra appeared under the editorship of Plekhanov alone. 
 On November 13 (26), 1903, Plekhanov, acting alone and in defiance of the Congress, co-opted the former Menshevik editors into the Iskra Editorial Board. 
 Beginning with No.

 Lenin has in mind the reactionary trend of the tsarist Russian press as typi-fied by the newspaper Novoye Vremya (New Times) which was published in St. 
 Petersburg from 1868 to October 1917.

 Schulze-Delitzsch —German economist and supporter of Bastiat. 
 In an effort to divert workers and artisans, who were becoming proletarianised, from the revolutionary struggle, he advocated the establishment of co-operative societies and loan and savings-banks, which, he claimed, could improve the proletariat’s con-dition within the framework of capitalism and save the artisan small producers from ruin.

 92 Report of the Iskra Editorial Board, which was written by Lenin, was intended for the conference of committees and organisations of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 held on March 23-28 (April 5-10), 1902, in Belostok. 
 Represented at the conference were: the St.

P. 
, the Central Committee of the Bund and its Foreign Committee, the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad, and the Iskra Editorial Board (whose representative, F. 
 I. 
 Dan, had a mandate from the League of Russian Revolutionary Social-Democracy Abroad). 
 Through the fault of the conference organisers, who were “econo-mists ”, the delegate of the Iskra Editorial Board arrived late, after the conference had begun, while F. 
 V. 
 Lengnik, the representative of the Russian Iskra organisation, did not get to the conference at all, although he arrived in Belostok in good time. 
 The rep-resentative of the Nizhni-Novgorod Committee ( Iskra trend), A. 
 I. 
 Piskunov, who arrived in Belostok before Dan, protested at the absence of representatives of organisations of the Iskra 37trend, and soon left. 
 The “economists” and the Bundists, who supported them, had intended to convert the conference into the Second Congress of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
, reckoning thereby to strength-en their own position in the ranks of Russian Social-Democracy and paralyse Iskra ’s growing influence. 
 Their attempt, however, failed, both because of the conference’s comparatively limited composition (only four of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 organisations operating in Russia were represented) and the deep disagreements on matters of principle, which were revealed at the conference; in particular, the Iskra delegate, who raised strong objection to the conference being converted into a Party congress, stated that the conference had not been properly prepared and authorised. 
 The Belostok Conference adopted a constituting resolution and a theoretical resolution, proposed by the delegate of the Bund Central Committee, with amendments made by the representative of the League of Southern Committees and Organisations of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 (the Iskra delegate, who had advanced his own draft of the theoretical resolution, voted against). 
 The conference also approved the text of a May Day leaflet, which was based on a draft drawn up by the Iskra Editorial Board. 
 The conference elected an Organising Committee to prepare the Second Party Congress, consisting of representatives of Iskra (F. 
 I. 
 Dan), the League of Southern Committees and Organisations of the R. 
S.

 (O.

 95 “Economism ”—an opportunist trend in Russian Social-Democracy at the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centu-ries, a Russian variety of international opportunism. 
 The newspaper Rabochaya Mysl (Workers’ Thought) (1897-1902) and the magazine Rabocheye Dyelo (Workers’ Cause) (1899-1902) were organs of the “economists”. 
 In 1899 there appeared Credo , a manifesto of the “economists”, which was drawn up by E. 
 D. 
 Kuskova. 
 When Lenin, then in exile, received a copy of Credo , he wrote “A Protest by Russian Social-Democrats”, in which he sharply criticised the programme of the “economists”. 
 This protest was discussed and unanimously adopted at a conference of 17 Marxists serving terms of political exile, held in the village of Yermakovskoye, in Minusinsk Region. 
 The “economists” limited the tasks of the working class to an economic struggle for higher wages and better working conditions, etc. 
, asserting that the political struggle was the business of the liberal bourgeoisie. 
 They denied the leading role of the party of the working class, considering that the party should merely observe the spontaneous process of the movement and register events. 
 /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR 38 39 40In their deference to spontaneity in the working-class movement, the “economists” belittled the significance of revolutionary theory and class-consciousness, asserted that socialist ideology could arise out of the spontaneous movement, denied the need to instill socialist consciousness into the working-class movement, and thereby cleared the way for bourgeois ideology. 
 The “economists”, who opposed the need to create a centralised working-class party, stood for the sporadic and amateurish character of individual cir-cles and fostered confusion and wavering in the Social-Democratic movement. 
 “Economism” threatened to divert the working class from the class revolutionary path and turn it into a political appendage of the bourgeoisie. 
 Lenin’s Iskra played a major part in the struggle against “econ-omism”. 
 By his book, What Is to Be Done? , which appeared in March 1902, V. 
 I. 
 Lenin brought about the final ideological rout of “economism”.

 96 Nakanune (On the Eve)—a monthly magazine of the Narodnik trend, published in Russian in London from January 1899 to February 1902 under the editorship of W. 
 A. 
 Serebryakov; 37 num-bers were issued. 
 Grouped round the magazine, which advocated general democratic views, were representatives of various petty-bourgeois parties and trends; a hostile attitude to Marxism in general and to Russian revolutionary Social-Democracy in particu-lar was characteristic of Nakanune .

 9 6 Svoboda (Freedom)—a magazine published in Switzerland by the “revolutionary-socialist” group Svoboda , founded by E. 
 O. 
 Zelensky (Nadezhdin) in May 1901. 
 Only two numbers of the magazine appeared: No. 
 1 in 1901 and No. 
 2 in 1902. 
 V. 
 I. 
 Lenin considered that the Svoboda group belonged to those groups which had “no stable or serious principles, programmes, tactics, organisation, and no roots among the masses” (see present edition, Vol. 
 20, p. 
 237). 
 In its publications (besides Svoboda , the group published The Eve of Revolution. 
 An Irregular Review of Problems of Theory and Tactics , No. 
 1; the newspaper-magazine Otkliki [Responses], No. 
 1; Nadezhdin’s programmatic pamphlet, The Rebirth of Revolutionism in Russia , and others) the Svoboda group advocated the ideas of terrorism and “economism”. 
 In a bloc with the St. 
 Petersburg “economists”, it came out against Iskra and the St. 
 Petersburg Committee of the R.

 96 The Bund —the General Jewish Workers’ Union of Lithuania, Poland, and Russia—was organised in 1897 at an inaugural con-gress of Jewish Social-Democratic groups in Vilno; in the main, it united semi-proletarian elements of the Jewish artisans in the Western regions of Russia. 
 At the First Congress of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 (1898), the Bund joined the Party “as an autonomous organisation, independent only in regard to questions specially concerning the Jewish proletariat”. 
 41The Bund brought nationalism and separatism into the Russian working-class movement and took an opportunist stand on the most important questions of the Social-Democratic movement. 
 In April 1901, the Bund’s Fourth Congress voted for abolition of the organisational relations established by the First Congress of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
, stating in its resolution that it regarded the R.

 as a federative association of national organisations which the Bund should join as a federative unit.

P. 
, which rejected the Bund’s demand that it should be recognised as the sole represen-tative of the Jewish proletariat, the Bund left the Party rejoining it in 1906, on the basis of a decision of the Fourth (Unity) Congress. 
 Within the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
, the Bundists constantly supported its opportunist wing (the “economists”, Mensheviks, and liquidators), and waged a struggle against the Bolsheviks and Bolshevism. 
 To the Bolshevik programme’s demand for the right of nations to self-determination the Bund opposed the demand for cultural and national autonomy. 
 During the years of the Stolypin reaction, the Bund adopted a liquidators’ stand and took an active part in forming the anti-Party August bloc. 
 During the First World War, the Bundists took a social-chauvinist stand. 
 In 1917 the Bund supported the counter-revolutionary Provisional Govern-ment and fought on the side of the enemies of the October Socialist Revolution, its leadership joining the forces of counter-revolution during the years of foreign military intervention and civil war. 
 At the same time a swing towards co-operation with Soviet power was to be observed among the Bund rank and file. 
 In March 1921 the Bund dissolved itself, part of its members joining the R.

 Goldman in April 1901 and existed until March 12 (25), 1902. 
 It printed G. 
 V. 
 Plekhanov’s article, “What Next?” (reprinted from No. 
 2-3 of Zarya ), N. 
 K. 
 Krupskaya’s pamphlet, The Working Woman , The Indictment in the Case of the May Disturbances at the Obukhov Factory (reprinted from Iskra , No.

 No.

 The Baku print-shop (called “Nina” in secret correspondence) was organised in September 1901 by a group of Baku Iskra -ists (V.

 99 The Emancipation of Labour group —the first Russian Marxist group—was founded by G. 
 V. 
 Plekhanov in Switzerland in 1883. 
 Besides Plekhanov, the group included P. 
 B. 
 Axelrod, L. 
 G. 
 Deutsch, V. 
 I. 
 Zasulich, and V. 
 N. 
 Ignatov. 
 The Emancipation of Labour group did much to propagate Marxism in Russia. 
 It translated into the Russian language works by Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, such as The Manifesto of the Com-munist Party , Wage Labour and Capital , Socialism : Utopian and Scientific , publishing them abroad and distributing them in Rus-sia, and also popularised Marxism through its publications. 
 The Emancipation of Labour group dealt a severe blow at Narodism, which was the chief ideological obstacle to the spread of Marxism and the development of the Social-Democratic movement in Rus-sia. 
 In his works, Socialism and the Political Struggle (1883), Our Differences (1885), and others, G. 
 V. 
 Plekhanov gave a Marxist criticism of the Narodnik theories of Russia’s non-capitalist path of development, the Narodniks’ subjective-idealist view of the role of the individual in history, the denial of the proletariat’s leading role in the revolutionary movement, etc. 
 Written by Plekha-nov and published by the Emancipation of Labour group, the two draft programmes of the Russian Social-Democrats (1883 and 1885) were an important step in preparing for and creating the Social-Democratic Party in Russia. 
 Of special importance in spreading Marxist views and in substantiating and defending dialectical and historical materialism was Plekhanov’s (N. 
 Beltov’s) book, The Development of the Monist View of History (1895), on “which has helped to rear a whole generation of Russian Marxists” (see present edition, Vol. 
 16, p. 
 269). 
 The group published and distributed in Russia four issues of the magazine Sotsial-Demokrat , as well as a series of popular pamphlets for workers. 
 Engels welcomed the appearance of the Emancipation of Labour group, “which frankly and without equivocation accepted the great economic and historical theories of Marx” (see Frederick Engels’ Letter to V. 
 I. 
 Zasulich, April 23, 1885. 
 Marx and Engels, Selected Correspondence , Moscow, p. 
 459). 
 G. 
 V. 
 Plekhanov and V. 
 I. 
 Zasulich were personal friends of Engels and corresponded with him for many years. 
 The Emancipation of Labour group estab-lished contacts with the international working-class movement and, beginning with the First Congress of the Second International in 1889 (Paris) and throughout the whole of its existence repre-sented Russian Social-Democracy at all congresses of the Inter-national. 
 But the views of the Emancipation of Labour group also contained serious errors: over-estimation of the liberal bourgeoi-43sie’s role and under-estimation of the revolutionary nature of peasantry as the reserve force of the proletarian revolution. 
 These were the germ of the future Menshevik views held by Plekhanov and other members of the group. 
 V. 
 I. 
 Lenin pointed out that the Emancipation of Labour group “only laid the theoretical foun-dations for the Social-Democratic movement and took the first step towards the working-class movement” (see present edition, Vol. 
 20, p. 
 278). 
 In 1894 the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad was formed on the initiative of the Emancipation of Labour group. 
 The members of the Emancipation of Labour group and their adherents left the Union in 1900 and founded the Sotsial-Demokrat revolutionary organisation.

 101 Bernsteinism —a trend hostile to Marxism in the German and inter-national Social-Democratic movement, which originated at the end of the nineteenth century and was named after Eduard Bern-stein, the most outspoken representative of revisionism. 
 In 1896-98 Bernstein wrote a series of articles entitled “Prob-lems of Socialism” for the magazine Die Neue Zeit , the theoretical organ of German Social-Democracy. 
 In these articles, he tried under the guise of “freedom of criticism” to revise (hence the word “revisionism”) the philosophical, economic, and political foun-dations of revolutionary Marxism and to substitute for them bour-geois theories of reconciliation of class contradictions, and of class collaboration. 
 He attacked Marx’s doctrine of the impoverish-ment of the working class, the growth of class contradictions, crises the inevitable collapse of capitalism, socialist revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat, and brought forward a programme of social-reformism expressed in the formula: “the movement is everything, the final goal—nothing”. 
 In 1899 Bern-stein’s articles appeared in a book entitled The Premises of Social-ism and the Tasks of Social-Democracy . 
 The book had the support of German Social-Democracy’s Right wing, and of opportunist elements in other parties of the Second International, including the Russian “economists”. 
 Bernsteinism was condemned at the congresses of the German Social-Democratic Party in Stuttgart (October 1898), Hanover (October 1899), and Lübeck (September 1901). 
 However, the Party leadership did not show sufficient determination in opposing Bern-stein and his adherents, but adopted a conciliatory attitude. 
 The Bernsteinites continued their open propaganda of revisionist ideas in the magazine Socialistische Monatshefte (Socialist Monthly) and in the Party organisations. 
 Headed by V. 
 I. 
 Lenin, the Bolshevik Party alone waged a consistent and resolute struggle against Bernsteinism and its adherents and followers in Russia. 
 As early as 1899, Lenin came 44 45 46out against the Bernsteinites in his “A Protest by Russian Social-Democrats” and in his article, “Our Programme” (see present edi-tion, Vol. 
 4, pp. 
 167-82 and 210-14). 
 His writings, “Marxism and Revisionism” (see present edition, Vol. 
 15), “Differences in the European Labour Movement” (see present edition, Vol. 
 16), and others, were also devoted to an exposure of Bernsteinism.

 The magazine supported Bern-stein’s slogan of “freedom of criticism” of Marxism, took an oppor-tunist stand on questions of Russian Social-Democracy’s tactics and organisational tasks, denied the revolutionary possibilities of the peasantry, and so on. 
 Its supporters propagated opportunist ideas of subordinating the proletariat’s political struggle to the economic, exalted spontaneity in the working-class movement and denied the Party’s leading role. 
 V. 
 P.

 119 Narodnaya Volya (The People’s Will)—a secret political organi-sation of Narodnik terrorists, which arose in August 1879, following a split in the secret society Zemlya i Volya (Land and Liberty). 
 The Narodnaya Volya was headed by an Executive Committee which included A. 
 I. 
 Zhelyabov, A. 
 D. 
 Mikhailov, M.

 Frolenko, N. 
 A. 
 Morozov, V. 
 N.

 L. 
 Perovskaya, A. 
 A. 
 Kvyatkov-sky. 
 While continuing to uphold Utopian Narodnik socialism, the members of the Narodnaya Volya (Narodovoltsi) at the same time put forward the task of achieving political liberty. 
 Their pro-gramme envisaged the organisation of “permanent popular repre-sentation” created on the basis of universal suffrage, the procla-mation of democratic liberties, the transfer of the land to the people, and the working out of measures for handing over the factories to the workers. 
 The overthrow of the tsarist autocracy was the immediate aim of the Narodnaya Volya, but, since it had no links with the masses, the Narodovoltsi took the path of political plots and individual terrorism. 
 After March 1, 1881 (the assassination of Alexander II), the government smashed the Narodnaya Volya organisation by savage persecution, executions, and provocation. 
 Repeated attempts to revive the Narodnaya Volya during the eighties proved fruitless. 
 In 1886, for instance, a group was formed under the leadership of A. 
 I. 
 Ulyanov (the brother of V. 
 I. 
 Lenin) and P. 
 Y. 
 Shevyrev, which adopted the traditions of the Narodnaya Volya. 
 After an unsuccessful attempt on the life of Alexander III in 1887, the group was uncovered and its active members executed. 
 While criticising the erroneous Utopian programme of the Narodovoltsi, V. 
 I. 
 Lenin at the same time held in high regard the self-sacrificing struggle against tsarism waged by the members of the Narodnaya Volya organisation. 
 In 1899 he pointed out in “A Protest by Russian Social-Democrats” that “the members of the old Narodnaya Volya managed to play an enormous role in the history of Russia, despite the fact that only narrow social strata supported the few heroes, and despite the fact that it was by no means a revolutionary theory which served as the banner of the movement” (see present edition, Vol. 
 4, p. 
 181). 
 p. 
 120 Lenin has in mind the gubernia committees set up in 1857-58 in all the gubernias of European Russia (with the exception of Archan-gel Gubernia) to draw up drafts for the emancipation of the peas-ants from serfdom. 
 The committees consisted of persons elected from among the nobility (hence the name “committees of nobles”) and, in the main, they were engaged in seeking ways and means 50 51 52 53 54 55of carrying out the “Peasant Reform” in a way to give the nobility the greatest benefit from it.

 124 The Valuyeu Commission —the “Commission to Investigate the Condition of Russian Agriculture”, which functioned under the chairmanship of the tsar’s minister P. 
 A. 
 Valuyev. 
 In the years 1872-73 the commission collected a large amount of material dealing with the condition of agriculture in post-Reform Russia: governors’ reports, statements and depositions of landlords, Marshals of the Nobility, Zemstvo administrations, volost boards, grain merchants, village priests, kulaks, statistical and agricul-tural societies and other bodies connected with agriculture. 
 This material was published in Papers of the Commission of Inquiry into the Condition of Russian Agriculture , St. 
 Petersburg, 1873. 
 p. 
 127 Oblomov —a landowner, the chief character in a novel of the same name by the Russian writer I. 
 A. 
 Goncharov. 
 Oblomov was the personification of routine, stagnation, and incapacity for action. 
 The name is used here in a generic sense to signify the Russian landowner. 
 p. 
 130 “General Redistribution ”—a slogan popular among the peasants of tsarist Russia and expressing their desire for a general redis-tribution of the land. 
 p. 
 136 The criticism of Nadezhdin’s opportunist views given on pages 138-39 of this volume (beginning with the words: “It is interesting to note that, in his desire to reach just such a maximum as nationalisation of the land, Nadezhdin has gone astray...” and ending with the words: “The desire to be ‘understood by the muzhik’ at all costs has driven Nadezhdin into the jungle of a reactionary petty-bourgeois Utopia”) was omitted by the Editorial Board when the article was first published in Zarya , No 4. 
 Nor did Zarya print the footnote which Lenin wrote to replace the omitted text. 
 In the present edition the text and footnote are given according to Lenin’s manuscript.

 140 Rural superintendent (Zemsky Nachalnik )—an administrative post instituted by the tsarist government in 1889 to strengthen the authority of the landlords over the peasants. 
 The rural superin-tendents were appointed from among the local landed nobility and were granted extensive powers, not merely administrative but also judicial. 
 p. 
 140 Moskovskiye Vedomosti (Moscow Recorder)—one of the oldest Russian newspapers, published by Moscow University from 1756 (originally as a one-sheet paper). 
 During 1863-87 it was published and edited by M. 
 N. 
 Katkov, an extreme reactionary and chau-vinist, who was bitterly opposed to the least signs of progressive social thought and transformed the newspaper into a monarchist-56 57 58 59nationalist organ voicing the views of the most reactionary sec-tions of the landlords and clergy. 
 From 1905 Moskovskiye Vedomosti was one of the chief organs of the Black Hundreds. 
 It was closed down at the end of 1917. 
 p. 
 144 Oblomovka —the name of a village belonging to the landlord Oblo-mov. 
 (See Note 51. 
) Here the word “Oblomovka” is used to denote a Russian village in the days of tsarism. 
 p. 
 147 The reference is to the peasant movement in the Poltava and Kharkov gubernias at the end of March and beginning of April 1902—the first large-scale revolutionary action of Russian peasants at the beginning of the twentieth century. 
 It was sparked by the desperate condition of the peasants in these gubernias, which became still worse in the spring of 1902 owing to the crop failure of 1901 and the resulting famine. 
 The peasants demanded a redis-tribution of the land, but in the 1902 movement they limited themselves in the main to seizing stocks of food and fodder on the landlords’ estates. 
 In all, 56 estates in Poltava Gubernia and 24 in Kharkov Gubernia were attacked. 
 Troops were dispatched to crush the peasants. 
 These reprisals by the tsarist government resulted in many peasants being killed, all the inhabitants of cer-tain villages flogged, and hundreds of peasants condemned to varying terms of imprisonment. 
 The peasants were forced to pay an indemnity of 800,000 rubles for “losses” caused to the landlords by the peasant disorders. 
 In his pamphlet, To the Rural Poor (see pp. 
 421-28 of this volume), V. 
 I. 
 Lenin gave an analysis of the aims and character of the peasant movement in the Kharkov and Poltava gubernias, and the causes of its defeat. 
 p. 
 148 The reference is to “The Autocracy and the Zemstvo”, which P. 
 B. 
 Struve (under the pen-name of R. 
 N.

) wrote as a fore-ward to a “confidential memorandum” of S. 
 Y. 
 Witte, Minister of Finance, and which was published by Zarya in Stuttgart in 1901. 
 This foreword was strongly criticised by Lenin in his work, “The Persecutors of the Zemstvo and the Hannibals of Liberal-ism” (see present edition, Vol. 
 5).

 or the Northern Labour League—a regional union of the Social-Democratic organisation in Vladimir, Yaroslavl, and Kostroma gubernias. 
 It arose in 1900-01 on the initiative of O. 
 A. 
 Varentsova and V. 
 A. 
 Noskov, who were exiled from Yaroslavl and Ivanovo-Voznesensk, went to live in Voronezh and, together with other exiled Social-Demo-crats (A. 
 I. 
 Lyubimov, L. 
 Y. 
 Karpov, A. 
 A. 
 and N. 
 N. 
 Kardashev, D.

 Among those who also took part in the organisation of the Northern League were M. 
 A. 
 Bagayev an Ivanovo-Voznesensk worker; N. 
 N. 
 Panin, a worker of the Putilov Factory, exiled to Siberia for taking part in the St. 
 Petersburg League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class; A. 
 P. 
 Dolivo-Dobrovolsky, and others. 
 In the years 1901-05, the League guided the working-class movement in this industrial region. 
 Its activities grew considerably after the Kineshma Conference, held in August 1901, of representatives of the Social-Democratic committees of Ivanovo-Voznesensk, Vladimir, Yaroslavl, and Kostroma. 
 At the League’s congress in Voronezh on January 1-5, 1902, it took final shape, electing a Central Committee (Bagayev, Varentsova, Panin, and others) and adopting a programme, which V. 
 I. 
 Lenin criticised in his letter to the Northern League. 
 From the outset the Northern League was linked with Iskra and shared the latter’s political line and plan of organisation (in the Iskra organisation’s report to the Second Congress of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 it was pointed out that “of all the Party committees, the Northern League alone immediately entered into friendly relations with Iskra ”). 
 In an open letter published in No. 
 34 of Iskra on February 15, 1903, the League expressed complete soli-darity with the programme of Iskra and Zarya and with Lenin’s book, What Is to Be Done? , and recognised Iskra and Zarya a s the leading organs of the R.

 Paragraph 11 of the Northern League’s programme stated that leaflets issued on this occasion should “point out to the workers that they could expect nothing from the autocratic government” and should “endeavour to destroy the illusion that the emancipation was the personal act of the tsar, an act of good will on his part”.

 164 Zubatov —colonel of gendarmerie and chief of the Moscow Secret Police, on whose initiative a policy of “police socialism” was con-ducted in 1901-03. 
 This consisted in the setting up of legal workers’ organisations intended to divert the workers from the political struggle against the autocracy. 
 Through these organisations Zuba-tov attempted to direct the working-class movement towards the achievement of purely economic aims, and it was suggested to the60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67workers that the tsarist government was prepared to help improve their economic conditions. 
 The reactionary character of Zubatovism was unmasked by the revolutionary Social-Democrats, who made use of legal work-ing-class organisations so as to draw the working masses into the struggle against the autocracy. 
 As Lenin was to write later: “And now the Zubatov movement is outgrowing its bounds. 
 Initiated by the police in the interests of the police, in the interests of sup-porting the autocracy and demoralising the political consciousness of the workers, this movement is turning against the autocracy and is becoming an outbreak of the proletarian class struggle” (see present edition, Vol. 
 8, p. 
 90). 
 Under the impact of the revolutionary movement in 1903, the tsar’s government was forced to liquidate the Zubatov organi-sations.

 167 The pamphlet, Who Will Carry Out the Political Revolution? , was written by A. 
 A. 
 Sanin and printed in 1899 in the symposium, The Proletarian Struggle , No. 
 1, published by the Urals Social-Democratic Group. 
 The author of the pamphlet, who adopted the position of “economism”, denied the need to create an inde-pendent political party of the working class and maintained that a political revolution could be carried out by means of a general strike, without any preliminary organisation and preparation of the masses, and without an armed uprising.

 168 Revolutsionnaya Rossiya (Revolutionary Russia)—an illegal news-paper of the Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
 It was published from the end of 1900 in Russia by the League of Socialist-Revolution-aries (No.

 174 The St. 
 Petersburg League —the St. 
 Petersburg League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class, was organised by Lenin in the autumn of 1895 and united all the Marxist workers’ study circles in St. 
 Petersburg. 
 The League of Struggle was headed by a Central Group, which was led by Lenin. 
 The League of Struggle was the first in Russia to begin bringing about the union of social-ism with the working-class movement, as well as the transition from propaganda of Marxism among a small group of advanced workers to political agitation among the broad masses of the working class. 
 68 69 70In December 1895 the tsarist government dealt the League of Struggle a severe blow: during the night of December 8-9 (20-21), 1895, a large number of the League’s leaders, with V. 
 I. 
 Lenin at their head, were arrested, and the first issue of the newspaper Rabocheye Dyelo (Workers’ Cause), which was ready for the press, was seized. 
 From prison V. 
 I. 
 Lenin continued to guide the League’s activ-ities: he helped it with advice, sent out letters and leaflets in cipher, wrote a pamphlet On Strlkes (which has not been discov-ered), and the “Draft and Explanation of a Programme for the Social-Democratic Party” (see present edition, Vol. 
 2, pp. 
 93-121). 
 As Lenin put it, the League’s importance lay in its being the embryo of a revolutionary party based on the working-class move-ment and guiding the proletariat’s class struggle. 
 The older members of the League who had escaped arrest took part in preparing for and conducting the First Congress of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 and in drafting the “Manifesto” published in the name of the Congress. 
 However, the prolonged absence of the League’s founders serving terms of exile in Siberia, and, above all, of V. 
 I. 
 Lenin, facilitated the adoption of an opportunist policy by the “young” Social-Democrats, the “economists”, who from 1897 through the newspaper Rabochaya Mysl (Workers’ Thought), implanted the ideas of trade-unionism and Bernsteinism on Rus-sian soil. 
 From the second half of 1898 the most outspoken “econ-omists”—the Rabochaya Mysl supporters—gained leadership of the League.

 174 The Workers ’ Organisation (for secrecy dubbed Manya )—an organ-isation of supporters of “economism”, which arose in St.

 was formed, consisting of two parts: the “Committee” proper and the “Committee of the Workers’ Organisation”. 
 After the Iskra trend triumphed in the St.

 Petersburg Committee and recreated an independent “Workers’ Organisation”, which existed until the beginning of 1904.

 But as Iskra ’s influence increased, its Rus-sian organisation more and more became the hub of the Russian Social-Democratic movement; there was a considerable increase in the volume of practical work carried out by the Iskra -ists (arranging stores of Party literature and its transport and dis-tribution among the Social-Democratic organisations, collecting money and dispatching correspondence to Iskra , etc. 
). 
 All this urgently required the formation of an all-Russian centre of the Iskra supporters’ activity, and the formation of a Russian Iskra organisation. 
 V. 
 I. 
 Lenin gives the date of the founding of the Russian Iskra organisation as January 1902, when a congress of Iskra supporters working in Russia was held in Samara, with the active partici-pation of G. 
 M. 
 and Z. 
 P. 
 Krzhizhanovsky, F. 
 V. 
 Lengnik, and others. 
 The congress elected a Bureau and adopted the rules of the organisation, worked out tactical principles and defined the duties of the organisation’s members. 
 “Your initiative,” V. 
 I. 
 Lenin wrote to the organisers of the congress, “has heartened us tremen-dously. 
 Hurrah! That’s the right way! Reach out wider! And operate more independently, with greater initiative—you are the first to have begun in such a broad way that it means that the contin-uation, too, will be successful” ( Lenin Miscellany VIII , p.

 197 Katheder-reformers , Katheder-Socialists —representatives of a trend in bourgeois political economy, which arose in Germany in the seventies and eighties of the nineteenth century. 
 Under the guise of socialism the Katheder -Socialists advocated from the university chairs ( Katheder in German) bourgeois-liberal reformism. 
 Kathe-der-Socialism was motivated by the exploiting classes’ fear of the spread of Marxism and the growth of the working-class movement, and also by the efforts of bourgeois ideologists to find fresh means of keeping the working people in subjugation. 
 Representatives of Katheder -Socialism (Adolf Wagner, Gustav Schmoller, Lorenz Brentano, Werner Sombart, and others, asserted that the bourgeois state stands above classes and is capable of reconciling the hostile classes and of gradually introducing “social-ism”, without affecting the interests of the capitalists and, as far as possible, with due account of the working people’s demands. 
 They proposed giving police regulation of wage-labour the force of law and reviving the medieval guilds. 
 Marx, Engels and Lenin exposed the reactionary nature of Katheder -Socialism, which in Russia was spread by the “legal Marxists”.

 The members of the Narodnoye Pravo set themselves the aim of uniting all oppo-sition forces to fight for political reforms. 
 The organisation issued two programme documents, “Manifesto”, and “An Urgent Ques-tion”. 
 In the spring of 1894 it was smashed by the tsarist govern-ment. 
 Lenin’s estimation of the Narodnoye Pravo as a political party is to be found in his “What the ‘Friends of the People’ Are and How They Fight the Social-Democrats” (see present edition Vol. 
 1, pp. 
 129-332), and “The Tasks of the Russian Social-Demo-crats” (see present edition, Vol.

 Struve. 
 Arising out of the opposition Zemstvo movement, Osvobozhdeniye was in fact the illegal organ of the Russian liberal bourgeoisie and consistently advocated the ideas of moderate-monarchist liberalism. 
 In 1903 the League of Emancipation developed around the magazine (taking definite shape in January 1904), and continued to exist until October 1905. 
 Together with the Zemstvo-constitutionalists, the Osvobozhdeniye group formed the nucleus of the Cadet Party—the chief bourgeois party in Russia—which was formed in October 1905.

 It was published in Berlin from 1897 to 1933.

 The chief feature of the Law of June 3, 1886, was the79 80 81 82 83 84 certain restriction it placed on the arbitrary right of factory owners to exact fines from the workers (hence it became known as the “Law on Fines”). 
 Lenin gave a detailed analysis and criticism of this law in the pamphlet, Explanation of the Law on Fines Imposed on Factory Workers (see present edition, Vol. 
 2, pp. 
 29-72). 
 The Law of June 2 (14), 1897 (“On the Duration and Distribution of Working Hours in Enterprises of the Factory Industry”) intro-duced, for the first time in Russian history, legislative limitation of the working day for part of the workers in large-scale industry. 
 Like the Law of June 3, 1886, it was passed under the influence of the working-class movement in the nineties of the nineteenth century, particularly the mass strikes of the St. 
 Petersburg workers in 1895-96.

 215 The Society of Mechanics (officially the Society for Mutual Aid of Workers Engaged in Mechanical Production) was formed in Moscow in May 1901 with the participation of the secret police. 
 Its rules were confirmed by the Governor-General of Moscow on February 14, 1902. 
 The formation of the Society was one of the attempts made to implant “police socialism”, Zubatovism (see Note 62), in order to divert the workers from the revolutionary struggle. 
 The demagogic flirting of the police with the workers and, in particular the attempts made by Zubatov agents, who controlled the Society of Mechanics, to assume the right to mediate in conflicts between employers and workers, evoked dissatisfac-tion among Moscow factory owners and protests from the Ministry of Finance, which reflected their interests. 
 Under the impact of the growing working class movement, the role of the Society, like that of other Zubatov organisations, dwindled away after 1903. 
 p. 
 216 The reference is to the so-called “Hard Labour” Bill ( Zuchthausvor-lage ) introduced in the German Reichstag in 1899 on the insistence of the employers and Emperor Wilhelm II. 
 The Bill imposed from one to five years of prison or a fine of up to 1,000 marks on anyone who “by violence, threats, insults or a declaration of dishonesty” helped workers take part in unions and agreements, in cited them to strike or tried to oppose strike-breaking. 
 Under pressure from the working-class movement, the “Hard Labour” Bill was turned down in the Reichstag on November 20, 1899, by the votes of the Left parties and the Centre party.

 Yuzhny Rabochy started as the “Ekaterinoslav Workers News-paper” (the subtitle of the first two issues), and soon became an influential “organ of the working-class movement in South Russia”. 
 The location of the newspaper’s print-shop was continually changed, being at different times in Ekaterinoslav, Smolensk, Kishinev, Nikolayev, and elsewhere. 
 Yuzhny Rabochy opposed “economism” and terrorism and upheld the need to develop a mass revolutionary movement. 
 But, in opposition to the Iskra plan of creating in Russia a centralised Marxist party round an all-Russian political newspaper, the Yuzhny Rabochy group put forward a plan for restoring the R.

 A practical attempt to realise this plan was made through convoca-tion of the conference of committees and organisations of the R.

 in South Russia in December 1901, at which the League of Southern Committees and Organisations of the R.

 was formed, with Yuzhny Rabochy as its organ. 
 The attempt proved impracticable (as was the entire organisational plan of Yuzhny Rabochy ) and after the mass police raids in the spring of 1902, the League disintegrated. 
 In August 1902, those members of Yuzhny Rabochy ’s Editorial Board who were at large entered into negotiations with the Iskra Editorial Board on joint work to restore the unity of Russian Social-Democracy. 
 The declara-tion of the Yuzhny Rabochy group on solidarity with Iskra (pub-lished in Iskra , No. 
 27, November 1, 1902, and in Yuzhny Rabochy , No. 
 10, December 1902) was of great importance in consolidating the Social-Democratic forces in Russia. 
 In November 1902, the Yuzhny Rabochy group, together with the Russian Iskra organi-sation, the St.

 participated in restoring the Organising Committee and in its activities in convening the Second Party Congress. 
 The Yuzhny Rabochy group conducted extensive revolutionary work in Russia, but at the same time it displayed opportunist tendencies in deciding the question of the attitude to the liberal bourgeoisie and to the peasant movement, and hatched a separatist plan to set up an all-Russia newspaper parallel to Iskra . 
 At the Second Congress of the R.

 After the arrest of V. 
 I. 
 Lenin and his close associates in Decem-ber 1895, the “economists” gradually gained control of the League89 of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class. 
 Unlike the revolutionary Marxists, who fought for the creation of an underground and centralised organisation of revolutionaries, the “economists” derogated the significance of political struggle and came out for creation of a broad working-class organisation based on the elective principle and pursuing the primary aim of immedi-ate defence of the workers’ economic interests, formation of mutual aid banks, and the like. 
 The “economists’” long control of the League of Struggle left an imprint on its organisational structure too: its working-class membership (the so-called Workers’ Organi-sation) was artificially separated from the intellectual members. 
 The League’s clumsy organisation was more adapted for a trade-union form of struggle than for leadership of the workers’ mass revolutionary struggle against the autocracy and the bourgeoisie. 
 The struggle between the Iskra -ists and the “economists” which developed in the St. 
 Petersburg organisation culminated in the St. 
 Petersburg Committee of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 going over to the Iskra stand in the summer of 1902. 
 “Two questions were raised,” it was reported in Iskra ’s No. 
 30 of December 15, 1902, “at a meeting held in the outskirts of St. 
 Petersburg in June , which was attended by workers representing all five wards of the Workers ’ Organisation (who comprised the highest body of the then Workers’ Organisation ). 
 These questions were: 1) the two trends in Russian Social-Democracy: the old ‘economist’ trend, which hitherto obtained in St. 
 Petersburg, and the revolutionary, as represented by Iskra and Zarya , and 2) prin-ciples of organisation (so-called ‘democratism’ or an ‘organisation of revolutionaries’). 
 On both issues all the workers came out unani-mously against ‘economism’ and ‘democratism’ and in favour of the Iskra trend . 
” To reconstruct the St. 
 Petersburg League of Struggle in the spirit of Iskra organisational principles, a committee was set up composed of representatives of the Iskra organisation, the Workers’ Organisation, and the St. 
 Petersburg Committee. 
 However, the “economists”, headed by Tokarev, stated that they disagreed with the St. 
 Petersburg Committee’s decision on support for the Iskra stand, formed the so-called Workers’ Organisation’s Committee, and launched a struggle against the Iskra -ists. 
 The latter, with the support of the workers, were able to retain their positions and fortify their standing in the St. 
 Petersburg organisation. 
 A Letter to a Comrade, in which Lenin developed and gave concrete shape to his plan for the Party’s organisation, was received in St. 
 Petersburg at the height of the struggle against the “econo-mists”. 
 It was hectographed, copied by hand, and distributed among St. 
 Petersburg Social-Democrats. 
 In June 1903 it was illegally published by the Siberian Social-Democratic League under the title of On Revolutionary Work in the Organisations of the R.

 The Letter was widely distributed in Social-Demo-cratic organisations, police archives for 1902-05 revealing that it was found during police raids in Moscow, Riga, Rostov-on-Don, Nakhichevan, Nikolayev, Krasnoyarsk, Irkutsk, and elsewhere.

 282 The League of Russian Revolutionary Social-Democracy Abroad was founded in October 1901 on Lenin’s initiative. 
 Affiliated to the League were the Iskra foreign organisation and the Sotsial-Demokrat organisation, which included the Emancipation of Labour group. 
 Formation of the League was preceded by an attempt to get these organisations join the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad, made in June 1901 at the Geneva Conference. 
 A resolution was worked out at this conference (“the agreement on principles”), recognising the need to rally all Social-Democratic forces of Rus-sia, and especially to unite all Social-Democratic organisations abroad, and condemning opportunism in all its shades and mani-festations. 
 The unification was to have been given official form at the “Unity” Congress, which was held on September 21-2298 99 100 101 102 103 104 (October 4-5), 1901. 
 When it became clear at the Congress that the Union still adhered to its opportunist stand, the revolutionary section of the Congress (members of the Iskra organisation and the Sotsial-Demokrat group) announced that they did not consider union possible and walked out. 
 Soon afterwards they formed the League Abroad, whose Rules stated that it was the foreign section of the Iskra organisation. 
 The League recruited Iskra adherents from among Russian Social-Democrats living abroad, gave finan-cial support to Iskra organised delivery of the paper to Russia and published Marxist popular literature. 
 It also brought out several bulletins and pamphlets, including Lenin’s To the Rural Poor. 
 The R.

L. 
P. 
’s Second Congress endorsed the League as the only Party organisation abroad with the status of a committee, and indicated that it could give support to the Russian Social-Democratic movement only through persons and groups appointed by the Party’s Central Committee. 
 Following the Second Congress, the Mensheviks entrenched themselves in the League and launched a struggle against Lenin and the Bolsheviks. 
 At the League’s second conference in October 1903, the Mensheviks got new Rules adopted, directed against the Party Rules approved by the Second Congress of the R. 
S.

 After this the League, which existed until 1905, became a strong-hold of Menshevism. 
 The Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad was founded in 1894 in Geneva, on the initiative of the Emancipation of Labour group, and had its own press where it printed revolutionary lit-erature. 
 At first the Emancipation of Labour group guided the Union and edited its publications. 
 The Union issued the Rabotnik miscellanies and Listok “Rabotnika ” (see Note 107), and published Lenin’s Explanation of the Law on Fines (1897), Plekhanov’s New Drive Against Russian Social-Democracy (1897), etc. 
 The First Congress of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
, held in March 1898, recognised the Union as the Party’s representative abroad. 
 As time proceeded, the opportunist elements—the “economists”, or so-called “young” group—gained the upper hand in the Union. 
 At the first con-ference of the Union, held in Zurich in November 1898, the Eman-cipation of Labour group announced their refusal to edit Union publications, with the exception of No. 
 5-6 of Rabotnik and Lenin’s pamphlets, The Tasks of the Russian Social-Democrats and The New Factory Law , which the group undertook to publish. 
 From then on, the Union published Rabocheye Dyelo , a magazine of the “economists”. 
 The Emancipation of Labour group finally broke with the Union and left its ranks in April 1900, at the Union’s second conference held in Geneva, when the Emancipation of Labour group and its supporters left the conference and established an independent Sotsial-Demokrat organisation. 
 In 1903 the Second Congress of the R.

 In all, two numbers were issued: No.

 P.

 Tuchapsky, who went abroad on the in-structions of the Editorial Board, acquainted G. 
 V. 
 Plekhanov and other members of the Emancipation of Labour group with No. 
 1 of Rabochaya Gazeta , and secured their consent to contribute to the paper. 
 In a letter to the members of the Editorial Board,G. 
 V. 
 Plekhanov gave a favourable appraisal of the paper as an all-Russian Social-Democratic organ, and pointed out that more attention should be paid to questions of the proletariat’s political struggle. 
 Following this contact with the Emancipation of Labour group, No. 
 2 of Rabochaya Gazeta was more definitely political in character. 
 The Social-Democrats, grouped round Rabochaya Gazeta , worked on the preparations for the First Congress of the R.

 After the Congress, the third issue of the newspaper, which was ready for the press, did not appear owing to the arrest of members of the Central Com-mittee and the Rabochaya Gazeta Editorial Board, and also to the seizure of the printing-press. 
 In 1899 an attempt was made to resumepublication of Rabochaya Gazeta ; V.

 It published Lenin’s article, “Reply to Mr.

 Makhayevism was marked by hostility towards the intelligentsia, which Makhaysky considered a parasitic class, and by an attempt to foster among the working class antagonism towards the revolutionary intelligentsia. 
 Individual Makhayevist groups lacking any organisational form or links with one another existed in Irkutsk, Odessa, Warsaw, St. 
 Petersburg, and else-where.

 On Lenin’s initiative a new Organising Committee was set up at the Pskov Conference of Social-Democratic committees held in November 1902. 
 The Iskra supporters had an overwhelming majority in the new committee. 
 Under Lenin’s leadership, the Organising Committee carried out considerable work in preparing the Second Party Congress. 
 In February 1903, draft rules for the convocation of the Party Congress were adopted at a plenary session held in Orel. 
 Following the February plenary session, members of the O. 
C. 
 twice visited local committees with a view to assisting them in their work. 
 With the participation of members of the O. 
C. 
 the local Party organisations discussed the draft rules for the convo-cation of the Congress, after which the rules were confirmed by the O.

, which was held in Minsk on March 1-3 (13-15), 1898. 
 It was attended by nine delegates from six organisations—the St. 
 Petersburg, Moscow, Ekaterinoslav and Kiev Leagues of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class, the group of the Kiev Rabochaya Gazeta , and the Bund. 
 The Congress elected the Central Committee of the Party, confirmed Rabochaya Gazeta as the Party’s official organ, published a “Manifesto”, and declared that the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad represented the Party abroad (see The C. 
P. 
S. 
U. 
 in Resolutions and Decisions of Its Congresses , Conferences ,109 110 111 112 and Plenary Meetings of the Central Committee , Part I, 1954, pp.

 The significance of the First Congress of the R. 
S.

P. 
 lay in the fact that, in its decisions and Manifesto, it proclaimed the formation of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, thereby being an important factor of revolutionary propaganda. 
 However, the Congress did not adopt a programme or work out the Party Rules. 
 The Central Committee elected at the Congress was arrested and the Rabochaya Gazeta print-shop seized, so that the Congress did not succeed in linking together and unifying the individual Marxist study circles and organisations. 
 There was no central leadership and no definite line in the work of the local organi-sations.

 331 This work consists of the programme of lectures on the agrarian question and an outline of the first lecture delivered by Lenin113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 in February 1903 at the Higher Russian School of Social Sciences in Paris. 
 The school was founded in 1901 for Russian students living abroad, and functioned legally. 
 The organisers of the school openly showed their dislike of the revolutionary Marxists and expressed sympathy with the representatives of the Narodniks and Socialist-Revolutionary party. 
 However, Lenin’s prestige as a theoretician of the agrarian question was so high that the school’s Council of Professors decided to invite “the well-known Marxist Vl. 
 Ilyin” (V. 
 I. 
 Lenin. 
— Ed. 
), “author of the legal books, The Development of Capitalism in Russia and Economic Studies ”, to deliver a course of lectures on the agrarian question. 
 Lenin drafted the programme of his lectures well in advance and presented it before opening the course. 
 The outline of the first lecture contained in this volume was taken down by one of the students of the school during the lecture and was then edited by Lenin. 
 p. 
 335 The Slavophils were a social trend in Russia in the middle of the nineteenth century, at a time when the serf-owning system was in the throes of a crisis. 
 The Slavophils held the “theory” that Russia had her own and peculiar path of historical development, one that derived from the village commune system and Russian Orthodoxy, which, they claimed, were inherent in the Slavs. 
 Since they held that Russia’s historical development excluded possibility of revo-lution, the Slavophils were strongly opposed to the revolutionary movement, not only in Russia, but in the West as well. 
 They stood for preservation of the autocracy, but thought that the monarch should give due consideration to public opinion, and proposed the calling of a Zemsky Sobor (Duma) composed of representatives of all sections of society. 
 They were, however, against a constitu-tion or any limiting of the autocracy. 
 In the peasant question the Slavophils stood for emancipation of the peasants as individuals, and for the village communes being allotted land through its redemption from landlords. 
 Among leading Slavophils were A. 
 Khomyakov, the Kireyevsky brothers, the Aksakov brothers, and Y. 
 Samarin.

 Lenin published two articles in Novoye Slovo : “A Char-121 122 123 124 acterisation of Economic Romanticism” and “About a Certain Newspaper Article” (see present edition, Vol.

 356 While preparing the pamphlet, To the Rural Poor , Lenin drew up several variants of the plan and individual items for the first variant, as well as plans for separate chapters of the pamphlet (see Lenin Miscellany XIX , pp. 
 339-56). 
 Regarding the aims of the pamphlet, To the Rural Poor , Lenin informed Plekhanov in a letter of March 1903 that he was writing a popular pamphlet for peasants about the agrarian programme, in which he explained the Marxist view of the class struggle in the countryside on the basis of concrete data on the four strata of the village population (landlords, peasant bourgeoisie, middle peasants, and semi-proletarians together with proletarians). 
 The pamphlet was published in Geneva in May 1903 by the League of Russian Revolutionary Social-Democracy Abroad.

 It was transported illegally to Russia from abroad, dispatched to various towns and from there distributed among the villages. 
 During the period from May 1903 to December 1905 alone, the pamphlet was supplied to 75 towns and villages according to the incomplete data available. 
 It was studied in illegal Social-Democratic and workers’ circles, penetrated into the army and navy, and was read by students in secondary schools and universities.

 The deeds recorded the amount of land in use by the peasants before the Reform, and determined the land the despoiled peasants kept after the “emancipation”. 
 The deeds also enumerated the services the serf peasants had previously performed for the landlord, and served as the basis in determining the amount of land redemption payment.

 Marx and Engels were managers of this newspaper, Marx being editor-in-chief. 
 As Lenin put it, the newspaper was “the best, the unsurpassed organ of the revolutionary proletariat” (see present edition, Vol. 
 21, p. 
 81). 
 It educated the masses, roused them to fight the counter-revolution, and made its influence felt throughout Germany. 
 Because of its resolute and irreconcilable position and its militant internationalism, the Neue Rheinische Zeitung was from the first months of its existence persecuted by the feudal-monarchist and liberal-bourgeois press, and also by the government. 
 Marx’s depor-tation by the Prussian Government and the repressive measures against its other editors led to the paper ceasing publication. 
 About the Neue Rheinische Zeitung see the article by Engels, “Marx and the Neue Rheinische Zeitung (1848-49)” (Marx and Engels, Selected Works , Vol.

 was held on July 17 (30) to August 10 (23), 1903. 
 The first thirteen sessions of the Con-gress were held in Brussels, but owing to police persecution, the Congress sessions were transferred to London. 
 In all, 37 sessions were held. 
 There were 20 items on the agenda, of which the most important were: the Party programme, Party organisation (con-firmation of the Rules of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
), elections to the Central Committee and editorial board of the Party’s Central Organ. 
 Twen-ty-six organisations were represented at the Congress, which was attended by 43 delegates possessing 51 decisive votes (eight dele-gates had two votes each), and by 14 delegates with a deliberative voice. 
 The preparations for the Congress had been made by Lenin’s Iskra , Lenin himself carrying out tremendous work in this respect. 
 Lenin drew up the outline of the report on the work of the Iskra organisation, and composed the draft of the Party Rules, the draft resolutions on several questions planned for discussion130 131 132 133 134 at the Congress, the agenda and the standing orders of the Con-gress. 
 Lenin did much work among the delegates, ascertaining the gener-al situation and state of organisation in various parts of the coun-try, and discussing many of the problems confronting the Congress. 
 At a meeting of the Congress delegates, Lenin made a report on the national question. 
 The composition of the Congress was not homogeneous. 
 Attending it were not only supporters of Iskra , but also its opponents, as well as unstable and wavering elements. 
 Lenin’s preliminary acquaintance with the delegates made it possible for him to ascer-tain the political stand of each of them prior to the opening of the Congress. 
 Lenin was elected to the Bureau of the Congress and was a mem-ber of the main Congress committees: the programme, Rules and Credentials Committees. 
 He delivered the report on the Party Rules and spoke on almost all the subjects on the agenda. 
 The minutes of the Congress register more than one hundred and thirty speeches, remarks, and rejoinders made by Lenin.

 474 Lenin’s speech on the actions of the Organising Committee was evoked by the following incident. 
 Before the Congress met, the Organizing Committee had already rejected the demand of the Borba group for their representative to attend the Congress with a deliberative voice. 
 The Credentials Committee endorsed the Orga-nising Committee’s proposal. 
 When Credentials Committee’s decision had been reported to the Congress, one of the members of the Organising Committee demanded a recess so that this ques-tion might be reconsidered in the Organising Committee. 
 During the recess, the Organising Committee met and by a majority of votes (against one) decided to invite the representative of the Borba group to attend the Congress with a deliberative voice. 
 Those mentioned in the speech were: Yegorov—the Menshevik E. 
 Y. 
 Levin; Stein—the Menshevik E. 
 M. 
 Alexandrova; Pavlo-vich—the Bolshevik P. 
 A.

 p.

 478-80).

 495 Khizani —the name given to the landless peasants of Georgia, who in the distant past had been settled on tie lands of the land-lords on specially agreed terms. 
 The khizani were not formally considered serfs, enjoyed personal liberty, but remained perpetualtenants without any rights. 
 The 1861 Peasant Reform did not apply to the khizani , who continued to be completely dependent on the landlords. 
 These began to increase the khizani ’s services and confiscate the land they held. 
 The khizani system was abo-lished after the Great October Socialist Revolution. 
 Temporarily bound peasants was the name given to those for-mer serf peasants who were still compelled to carry out certain duties (payment of quit-rent or performance of corvée service) for the use of their land even after the abolition of serfdom in1861 and until they started paying redemption money to the land-lord for their allotments. 
 From the moment the redemption con-tract was concluded, the peasants ceased to be “temporarily bound”and joined the category of “peasant property-owners”. 
 On Lenin’s proposal, the Second Congress of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
 added to the agrarian section of the Party programme the demandfor “transfer to the ownership of the peasants in the Caucasus oflands which they are using as temporarily bound peasants, khi-zani , and so forth”.

 499 At the thirty-first session of the Second Congress Lenin delivered a speech on the subject of the election of the Iskra editorial board. 
 When the minutes of this session were ratified at the thirty-fifthsession of the Congress, a change was made, with Lenin’s consent, in the text of his speech. 
 The beginning of the speech—from the words: “Comrades! Martov’s speech was so strange that I findmyself obliged to protest emphatically against his presentationof the question...” and ending with the words “...is therefore138 139 140 141 142 143 144 indicative only of an astounding confusion of political ideas ”—was deleted and replaced by the following: “I ask the Congress to allow me to reply to Martov. 
“Comrade Martov said that the vote in question cast a slur on his political reputation. 
 The election has nothing to do with an insult to a political reputation ( Shouts : ‘Wrong! Not true! ’ Plekhanov and Lenin protest against recesses. 
 Lenin asks the secre-taries to enter in the minutes that Zasulich , Martov , and Trotsky have interrupted him , and he asks that the number of times they have interrupted him should be recorded . 
)” In the present volume Lenin’s speech is printed in the form in which he wrote it and delivered it at the Congress. 
 p. 
 503 Lenin is referring to the strike of Odessa workers in July 1902. 
 Despite the efforts of the local Zubatov organisation to deflectthe workers from the revolutionary struggle, the strike assumed a markedly political character. 
 Mass political strikes in 1903 embraced almost the whole of South Russia (Kiev, Ekaterinoslav,Nikolayev, Elizavetgrad, and other towns). 
 Lenin’s Iskra gave detailed accounts of the Odessa events in No. 
 45, August 1, 1903.
