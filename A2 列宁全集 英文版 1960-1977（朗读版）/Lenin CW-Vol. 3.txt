 THE DEVELOPMENT OF CAPITALISM IN RUSSIA THE PROCESS OF THE FORMATION OF A HOME MARKET FOR LARGE-SCALE INDUSTRY 1 Published according to the text of the second edition, 1908Written in 1896-99 . 
 First printed in book form at the end of March 1899 PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION In the work here presented, the author has set himself the aim of examining the question of how a home marketis being formed for Russian capitalism. 
 As we know, thisquestion was raised long ago by the principal exponentsof Narodnik views (chief among them being Messrs. 
 V. 
 V. 
and N. 
—on 2), and it will be our task to criticise these views. 
 We have not considered it possible to limit ourselves in this criticism to examining the mistakes and misconceptionsin our opponents’ views; in answering the question raised itseemed to us that it was not enough to adduce facts showingthe formation and growth of a home market, for the objec-tion might be raised that such facts had been selected arbitrarily and that facts showing the contrary had been omitted. 
 It seemed to us that it was necessary to examinethe whole process of the development of capitalism inRussia, to endeavour to depict it in its entirety. 
 It goeswithout saying that such an extensive task would be beyondthe powers of a single person, were a number of limitations not introduced. 
 Firstly, as the title itself shows, we treat the problem of the development of capitalism in Russiaexclusively from the standpoint of the home market, leavingaside the problem of the foreign market and data on foreigntrade. 
 Secondly, we limit ourselves purely to the post-Reformperiod. 
 Thirdly, we deal mainly and almost exclusively with data concerning the interior, purely Russian, guber-nias. 
 Fourthly, we limit ourselves exclusively to the eco-nomic aspect of the process. 
 But even with all the limitations indicated the topic that remains is an extremely broad one. 
 The author does not close his eyes at all to the difficulty, and even the danger, of dealing with so broad a topic, but it seemed to him that to elucidate the problem of the homemarket for Russian capitalism it was absolutely necessaryto show the connection between, and interdependence of,the various aspects of the process taking place in all spheresof the social economy. 
 We therefore limit ourselves to an examination of the main features of the process, leaving a more specific study of it to further investigations. 
 The plan of our work is as follows: in Chapter I we shall examine, as briefly as possible, the basic theoretical prop-ositions of abstract political economy on the subject ofthe home market for capitalism. 
 This will serve as a sort of introduction to the rest of the work, the factual part of it, and will relieve us of the need to make repeated referencesto theory in our further exposition. 
 In the three followingchapters we shall endeavour to describe the capitalist evo-lution of agriculture in post-Reform Russia, namely, inChapter II we shall examine Zemstvo statistical data on the differentiation of the peasantry; in Chapter III data on the transitional state of landlord economy, and on thereplacement of the corvée system of this economy by thecapitalist; and in Chapter IV data on the forms in whichthe formation of commercial and capitalist agriculture isproceeding. 
 The next three chapters will be devoted to the forms and stages of the development of capitalism in our industry: in Chapter V we shall examine the first stages ofcapitalism in industry, namely, in small peasant (known as handicraft ) industry ; in Chapter VI data on capitalist manufacture and on capitalist domestic industry, andin Chapter VII data on the development of large-scale machine industry. 
 In the last chapter (VIII), we shall make an attempt to indicate the connection between the variousaspects of the process that have been described and to pre-sent a general picture of that process.

 3 To our extreme regret we have not been able to use for this work the excellent analysis of “the development of agriculture in capitalist society” made by K. 
 Kautsky inhis book Die Agrarfrage (Stuttgart, Dietz, 1899; I. 
 Abschn. 
 “Die Entwicklung der Landwirtschaft in der kapitalisti-schen Gesellschaft” *). 
** This book (which we received when the greater part of the present work had already been set up in type) is, afterVol. 
 III of Capital , the most noteworthy contribution to recent economic literature. 
 Kautsky investigates the “maintendencies” in the capitalist evolution of agriculture; hispurpose is to examine the diverse phenomena in modern agriculture as “particular manifestations of one general process” (Vorrede, *** VI). 
 It is interesting to note how far the main features of this general process in WesternEurope and in Russia are identical, notwithstanding the tre-mendous peculiarities of the latter, in both the economicand non-economic spheres. 
 For example, typical of modern capitalist agriculture in general is the progressive division of labour and the employment of machinery (Kautsky,IV, b, c), a phenomenon also noticeable in post-ReformRussia (see later, Chapter III, §§VII and VIII; ChapterIV, particularly §IX). 
 The process of the “proletarisationof the peasantry” (the heading of Chapter VIII of Kautsky’s book) is manifested everywhere in the spread of wage-labour in every form among the small peasants (Kautsky,VIII, b); we see the parallel of this in Russia in the formationof a huge class of allotment-holding wage-workers (see later,Chapter II). 
 The existence of a small peasantry in everycapitalist society is due not to the technical superiority of small production in agriculture, but to the fact that the small peasants reduce the level of their requirements below thatof the wage-workers and tax their energies far more thanthe latter do (Kautsky, VI, b; “the agricultural wage-worker is better off than the small peasant,” says Kautskyrepeatedly: S. 
 110, 317, 320); the same thing is also to be observed in Russia (see later, Chapter II, §XI, C 4). 
 It is natural, therefore, that West-European and Russian Marx-ists should agree in their appraisal of such phenomena as“agricultural outside employments,” to use the Russian term,or the “agricultural wage-labour of migratory peasants,” * The Agrarian Question , Part I. 
 “The Development of Agri-culture in Capitalist Society. 
”— Ed. 
 **There is a Russian translation. 
 ***Preface. 
— Ed. 
 as the Germans say (Kautsky, S. 
 192; cf. 
 later, Chapter III, §X); or of such a phenomenon as the migration of workers and peasants from the villages to the towns and factories (Kautsky, IX, especially S. 
 343; and many other places. 
Cf. 
 later, Chapter VIII, §II); the transplantation of large-scale capitalist industry to the rural districts (Kautsky,S. 
 187. 
 Cf. 
 later, VII, §VIII). 
 This is quite apart from thesame appraisal of the historical significance of agricultural capitalism (Kautsky, passim, especially S. 
 289, 292, 298. 
 Cf. 
 later, Chapter IV, §IX), from the same recognition ofthe progressive nature of capitalist relations in agri-culture as compared with pre-capitalist relations [Kaut-sky, S. 
 382: “The ousting des Gesindes (of personallydependent farm labourers, servants) and der Instleute (“midway between the farm labourer and the tenant cul-tivator”: the peasant who rents land, making payment bylabour-service) by day labourers who outside of workinghours are free men, would mark great social progress. 
”Cf. 
 later, Chapter IV, §IX, 4]. 
 Kautsky categoricallydeclares that the adoption by the village community of large-scale modern agriculture conducted communally “is out of the question” (S. 
 338); that the agronomists in WesternEurope who demand the consolidation and development ofthe village community are not socialists at all, but peoplerepresenting the interests of the big landowners, who want totie down the workers by granting them patches of land (S. 
 334); that in all European countries those who repre-sent the landowners’ interests want to tie down the agricul-tural workers by allotting them land and are already tryingto give legislative effect to the appropriate measures(S. 
 162); that all attempts to help the small peasantry byintroducing handicraft industry (Hausindustrie )—that worst form of capitalist exploitation—“should be most resolutely combated” (S. 
 181). 
 We consider it necessary to emphasisethe complete unanimity of opinion between the West-European and the Russian Marxists, in view of the latestattempts of the spokesmen of Narodism to draw a sharpdistinction between the two (see the statement made by Mr. 
 V. 
 Vorontsov on February 17, 1899, at the Society for the Promotion of Russian Industry and Trade, Novoye Vremya [New Times ], No. 
 8255, February 19, 1899). 
 5 PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION6 This book was written in the period preceding the Rus-sian Revolution, during the slight lull that set in after theoutbreak of the big strikes of 1895-1896. 
 At that time theworking-class movement withdrew, as it were, into itself,spreading in breadth and depth and paving the way for the beginning in 1901 of the demonstration movement. 
 The analysis of the social-economic system and, conse-quently, of the class structure of Russia given in thiswork on the basis of an economic investigation and criticalanalysis of statistics, has now been confirmed by the openpolitical action of all classes in the course of the revolution. 
 The leading role of the proletariat has been fully revealed. 
 It has also been revealed that the strength of the proletariatin the process of history is immeasurably greater than itsshare of the total Population. 
 The economic basis of theone phenomenon and the other is demonstrated in thepresent work. 
 Further, the revolution is now increasingly revealing the dual position and dual role of the peasantry. 
 On theone hand, the tremendous survivals of corvée economy andall kinds of survivals of serfdom, with the unprecedentedimpoverishment and ruin of the peasant poor, fully explainthe deep sources of the revolutionary peasant movement, the deep roots of the revolutionary character of the peasantry as a mass. 
 On the other hand, in the course of the revolution,the character of the various political parties, and the numer-ous ideological-political trends reveal the inherently con-tradictory class structure of this mass, its petty-bourgeoischaracter, the antagonism between the proprietor and the proletarian trends within it. 
 The vacillation of the impov-erished small master between the counter-revolutionarybourgeoisie and the revolutionary proletariat is as inevitable /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR as the phenomenon existent in every capitalist society that an insignificant minority of small producers wax rich, “get on in the world,” turn into bourgeois, while the over-whelming majority are either utterly ruined and becomewage-workers or paupers, or eternally eke out an almostproletarian existence. 
 The economic basis of both these trendsamong the peasantry is demonstrated in the present essay. 
 With this economic basis the revolution in Russia is, of course, inevitably a bourgeois revolution. 
 This Marxist proposition is absolutely irrefutable. 
 It must never be for-gotten. 
 It must always be applied to all the economic andpolitical problems of the Russian Revolution. 
 But one must know how to apply it. 
 A concrete analysis of the status and the interests of the different classes must serve as a means of defining the precise significance of this truth when applied to this or that problem. 
 The oppositemode of reasoning frequently met with among the Right-wing Social-Democrats headed by Plekhanov, i. 
e. 
, theendeavour to look for answers to concrete questions in thesimple logical development of the general truth about the basic character of our revolution, is a vulgarisation of Marxism and downright mockery of dialectical materialism. 
 Of suchpeople, who from the general truth of the character of thisrevolution deduce, for example, the leading role of the “bour-geoisie” in the revolution, or the need for socialists tosupport the liberals, Marx would very likely have repeated the words once quoted by him from Heine: “I have sown dragon’s teeth and harvested fleas. 
” 7 With the present economic basis of the Russian Revolu-tion, two main lines of its development and outcome areobjectively possible: Either the old landlord economy, bound as it is by thou-sands of threads to serfdom, is retained and turns slowly into purely capitalist, “Junker” economy. 
 The basis of thefinal transition from labour-service to capitalism is theinternal metamorphosis of feudalist landlord economy. 
 Theentire agrarian system of the state becomes capitalist andfor a long time retains feudalist features. 
 Or the old landlord economy is broken up by revolution, which destroys all the relics of serfdom, and large landownership in the first place. 
The basis of the final transition from labour-service to capitalism is the free development of small peasant farming, which has received a tremendous impetus as a result of the expropriation of the landlords’ estates in the interests of the peasantry. 
 The entire agrarian system becomes capital-ist, for the more completely the vestiges of serfdom aredestroyed the more rapidly does the differentiation of thepeasantry proceed. 
 In other words: either—the retention, in themain, of landed proprietorship and of the chief supports of the old “superstructure”; hence, the predominant role of the liberal-monarchist bourgeois and landlord, the rapid transi-tion of the well-to-do peasantry to their side, the degrada-tion of the peasant masses, not only expropriated on a vastscale but enslaved, in addition, by one or other kind ofCadet 8-proposed land-redemption payments, and downtrodden and dulled by the dominance of reaction; the executors of such a bourgeois revolution will be politicians of a typeapproximating to the Octobrists. 
 9 Or—the destruction of landlordism and of all the chief supports of the correspond-ing old “superstructure”; the predominant role of theproletariat and the peasant masses, with the neutralising of the unstable or counter-revolutionary bourgeoisie; the speed-iest and freest development of the productive forces on acapitalist basis, under the best circumstances for the workerand peasant masses at all conceivable under commodityproduction;—hence, the establishment of the most favour-able conditions for the further accomplishment by the working class of its real and fundamental task of socialist reorganisation. 
 Of course, infinitely diverse combinations ofelements of this or that type of capitalist evolution are pos-sible, and only hopeless pedants could set about solving thepeculiar and complex problems arising merely by quotingthis or that opinion of Marx about a different historical epoch. 
 The essay here presented to the reader is devoted to an analysis of the pre-revolutionary economy of Russia. 
 In arevolutionary epoch, life in a country proceeds with suchspeed and impetuosity that it is impossible to define themajor results of economic evolution in the heat of politicalstruggle. 
 Messrs. 
 the Stolypins 10, on the one hand, and the liberals on the other (and not only Cadets à la Struve, but all the Cadets in general), are working systematically,doggedly and consistently to accomplish the revolution according to the first pattern. 
 The coup d’etat of June 3, 1907, that we have recently witnessed, marks a victory for the counter-revolution,11 which is striving to ensure the complete predominance of the landlords in the so-called represent-ative body of the Russian people. 
 But how far this “victory”is a lasting one is another matter; the struggle for the secondoutcome of the revolution goes on. 
 Not only the proletariat,but also the broad masses of the peasantry are striving, more or less resolutely, more or less consistently, and more or less consciously, for this outcome. 
 However much thecounter-revolution tries to strangle the direct mass struggleby outright violence, however much the Cadets try to strangleit by means of their despicable and hypocritical counter-revolutionary ideas, that struggle, in spite of all, is breaking out, now here and now there, and laying its impress upon the policy of the “labour,” Narodnik parties, although the topcircles of petty-bourgeois politicians are undoubtedlycontaminated (especially the “Popular Socialists” and Trudo-viks 12) with the Cadet spirit of treachery, Molchalinism13 and smugness characteristic of moderate and punctilious philistines or bureaucrats. 
 How this struggle will end, what the final result of the first onset of the Russian Revolution will be—it is atpresent impossible to say. 
 Hence, the time has not yetcome (moreover, the immediate Party duties of a partic-ipant in the working-class movement leave no leisure) for a thorough revision of this essay. 
 * The second edition can-not overstep the bounds of a characterisation of Russianeconomy before the revolution. 
 The author had to con-fine himself to going over and correcting the text andalso to making the most essential additions from the lateststatistical material. 
 These are recent horse-census data, harvest statistics, returns of the 1897 census of the popu-lation of Russia, new data from factory statistics, etc. 
 July 1907 The Author *Such a revision will possibly require a sequel to the present work. 
 In that case the first volume would have to be confined to ananalysis of Russian economy before the revolution, and the second volume devoted to a study of the results and achievements of the revolution. 
 C H A P T E R I THE THEORETICAL MISTAKES OF THE NARODNIK ECONOMISTS14 The market is a category of commodity economy, which in the course of its development is transformed into cap-italist economy and only under the latter gains completesway and universal prevalence. 
 Therefore, in order to exam-ine basic theoretical propositions concerning the homemarket we must proceed from simple commodity economyand trace its gradual transformation into capitalist econ-omy. 
 I. 
 THE SOCIAL DIVISION OF LABOUR The basis of commodity economy is the social division of labour. 
 Manufacturing industry separates from the raw materials industry, and each of these subdivides into small varieties and subvarieties which produce specific productsas commodities, and exchange them for the products ofall the others. 
 Thus, the development of commodityeconomy leads to an increase in the number of separateand independent branches of industry; the tendency of this development is to transform into a special branch of industry the making not only of each separate product, but even ofeach separate part of a product—and not only the makingof a product, but even the separate operations of preparingthe product for consumption. 
 Under natural economysociety consisted of a mass of homogeneous economic units (patriarchal peasant families, primitive village communi-ties, feudal manors), and each such unit engaged in allforms of economic activity, from the acquisition of various kinds of raw material to their final preparation for consump-tion. 
 Under commodity economy heterogeneous economic units come into being, the number of separate branches of economy increases, and the number of economic units per-forming one and the same economic function diminishes. 
It is this progressive growth in the social division of labourthat is the chief factor in the process of creating a home production and its absolute form, capitalist production,” says have an exchange-value that is to be realised, to be converted into money, only in so far as other commodities form an as commodities and values; thus, in so far as they are not produced as immediate means of subsistence for the producers themselves, but as commodities, as products which becomeuse-values only by their transformation into exchange-values (money), by their alienation. 
 The market for these commodities develops through the social division of labour ; the division of productive labours mutually transforms their respective products into commodities, into equivalents for each other, making them mutually serve as markets ” (Das Kapital , III, 2, 177-178. 
 Russ. 
 trans. 
, 526. 
 15 Our italics, as in all quotations, unless otherwise stated). 
 It goes without saying that the above-mentioned sepa-ration of the manufacturing from the raw materials industry, of manufacture from agriculture, transforms agriculture itself into an industry, into a commodity -producing branch of economy. 
 The process of specialisation that separates fromeach other the diverse varieties of the manufacture of prod-ucts, creating an ever-growing number of branches ofindustry, also manifests itself in agriculture, creating special-ised agricultural districts (and systems of farming) * and *For example, I. 
 A. 
 Stebut in his Principles of Crop Farming distinguishes farming systems according to the principal product marketed. 
 There are three main farming systems: 1) crop growing (grain farming, as Mr. 
 A. 
 Skvortsov calls it); 2) livestock raising(the principal product marketed being livestock produce); and3) industrial (technical farming, as Mr. 
 A. 
 Skvortsov calls it); theprincipal product marketed being agricultural produce that un-dergoes technical processing. 
 See A. 
 Skvortsov, The Influence of Steam Transport on Agriculture , Warsaw, 1890, p. 
 68 and foll. 
Marx, “. 
 . 
 . 
products are commodities, or use-values, which equivalent for them, that is, other products confront themmarket for capitalism . 
 “. 
 . 
 . 
Where the basis is commodity giving rise to exchange not only between the products of agriculture and industry but also between the various products of agriculture. 
 This specialisation of commercial (and capitalist) agriculture manifests itself in all capitalistcountries, in the international division of labour; this istrue of post-Reform Russia as well, as we shall show indetail below. 
 Thus, the social division of labour is the basis of the entire process of the development of commodity economy and ofcapitalism. 
 It is quite natural, therefore, that our Narod-nik theoreticians, who declare this process to be the resultof artificial measures, the result of a “deviation from thepath,” and so on and so forth, have tried to gloss over the fact of the social division of labour in Russia or to belittle its significance. 
 Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
, in his article “Division of Agri-cultural and Industrial Labour in Russia” ( Vestnik Yevropy [European Messenger ], 1884, No. 
 7), “denied” “the dominance in Russia of the principle of the social division of labour”(p. 
 347), and declared that in this country the social divi-sion of labour “has not sprung from the depths of the people’s life, but has attempted to thrust itself into it from outside”(p. 
 338). 
 Mr. 
 N. 
—on, in his Sketches , argued as follows about the increase in the quantity of grain offered forsale: “This phenomenon might imply that the grain pro-duced is more evenly distributed over the country, that the Archangel fisherman now consumes Samara grain, and thatthe Samara farmer supplements his dinner with Archan-gel fish. 
 Actually , however , nothing of the kind is happening ” ( Sketches on Our Post-Reform Social Economy , St. 
 Petersburg, 1893, p. 
 37). 
 Without any data and contrary to generally known facts, the categorical assertion is bluntly made here that there is no social division of labour in Russia!The Narodnik theory of the “artificial character” of capi-talism in Russia could only have been evolved by rejecting,or proclaiming as “artificial,” the very foundation of allcommodity economy, namely, the social division of labour. 
 II. 
 THE GROWTH OF THE INDUSTRIAL POPULATION AT THE EXPENSE OF THE AGRICULTURAL In view of the fact that in the epoch preceding commodity economy, manufacturing is combined with the raw mate-rials industry, and the latter is headed by agriculture,the development of commodity economy takes the shape ofthe separation from agriculture of one branch of industry after another. 
 The population of a country in which com-modity economy is poorly developed (or not developed atall) is almost exclusively agricultural. 
 This, however,must not be understood as meaning that the population isengaged solely in agriculture: it only means that the popu-lation engaged in agriculture, also process the products of agriculture, and that exchange and the division of labour are almost non-existent. 
 Consequently, the devel-opment of commodity economy eo ipso means the divorce-ment of an ever-growing part of the population from agri-culture, i. 
e. 
, the growth of the industrial population atthe expense of the agricultural population. 
 “ It is in the nature of capitalist production to continually reduce the agricultural population as compared with the non-agricul-tural, because in industry (in the strict sense) the increaseof constant capital at the expense of variable capital goeshand in hand with an absolute increase in variable capitaldespite its relative decrease; on the other hand, in agriculture the variable capital required for the exploitation of a certain plot of land decreases absolutely; it can thus only increaseto the extent that new land is taken into cultivation, butthis again requires as a prerequisite a still greater growthof the non-agricultural population” ( Das Kapital , III, 2, 177. 
 Russ. 
 trans. 
, p. 
 526). 
 16 Thus one cannot conceive of capitalism without an increase in the commercial and industrial population at the expense of the agriculturalpopulation, and everybody knows that this phenomenon isrevealed in the most clear-cut fashion in all capitalistcountries. 
 It need hardly be proved that the significanceof this circumstance as regards the problem of the home market is enormous, for it is bound up inseparably both with the evolution of industry and with the evolution ofagriculture; the formation of industrial centres, their numerical growth, and the attraction of the population by them cannot but exert a most profound influence on the whole rural system, and cannot but give rise to a growth of commercial and capitalist agriculture. 
 All the morenoteworthy is the fact that the exponents of Narodnikeconomics completely ignore this law both in their purelytheoretical arguments and in their arguments about capi-talism in Russia (we shall deal at length with the specific manifestations of this law in Russia later on, in Chapter VIII). 
 The theories of Messrs. 
 V. 
 V. 
 and N. 
—on regardingthe home market for capitalism overlook a mere trifle—the diversion of the population from agriculture to industry,and the influence exerted by this fact on agriculture. 
 * III. 
 THE RUIN OF THE SMALL PRODUCERS So far we have dealt with simple commodity production. 
 Now we pass to capitalist production, that is, we presumethat instead of simple commodity producers we have, on the one hand, the owner of means of production and, on the other, the wage-worker, the seller of labour-power. 
 Theconversion of the small producer into a wage-worker pre-sumes that he has lost the means of production—land, tools,workshop, etc. 
—i. 
e. 
, that he is “impoverished,” “ruined. 
”The view is advanced that this ruin “diminishes the pur-chasing power of the population,” “diminishes the home market” for capitalism (Mr. 
 N. 
—on, loc. 
 cit. 
, p. 
 185.

 The same view is heldby Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
 in the majority of his writings). 
 We do not dealhere with the factual data relating to this process inRussia—they will be examined in detail in later chapters. 
 At the moment the question is posed purely theoretically, i. 
e. 
, it relates to commodity production in general where it istransformed into capitalist production. 
 The writers mentionedalso pose this question theoretically, i. 
e. 
, from the mere *We have pointed to the identical attitude of the West-European romanticists and Russian Narodniks to the problem of the growth of industrial population in our article “A Characterisation of Economic Romanticism. 
 Sismondi and Our Native Sismondists,” (See presentedition, Vol. 
 2. 
— Ed. 
) fact of the ruin of the small producers they deduce a shrinkage of the home market. 
 This view is absolutely incorrect, and its persistent survival in our economic literature can only be explained by the romantic prejudices of Narodism(see the article referred to in the footnote). 
 It is forgottenthat the “freeing” of one section of the producers from themeans of production necessarily presumes the passage ofthe latter into other hands, their conversion into capital; presumes, consequently, that the new owners of these means of production produce as commodities the products formerlyconsumed by the producer himself, i. 
e. 
, expand the homemarket; that in expanding production the new owners ofthe means of production present a demand to the marketfor new implements, raw materials, means of transport, etc. 
, and also for articles of consumption (the enrichment of these new owners naturally presumes an increase in their consump-tion). 
 It is forgotten that it is by no means the well-beingof the producer that is important for the market but hispossession of money; the decline in the well-being of thepatriarchal peasant, who formerly conducted a mainly natural economy, is quite compatible with an increase in the amount of money in his possession, for the more sucha peasant is ruined, the more he is compelled to resort tothe sale of his labour-power, and the greater is the share ofhis (albeit scantier) means of subsistence that he mustacquire in the market. 
 “With the setting free (from the land) of a part of the agricultural population, therefore, their former means of nourishment were also set free. 
 They werenow transformed into material elements of variable capital”(capital spent on the purchase of labour-power) ( Das Kapital , I, 776). 
 “The expropriation and eviction of a part of theagricultural population not only set free for industrial capital the labourers, their means of subsistence, and ma-terial for labour; it also created the home market ” (ibid. 
 778). 
 17 Thus, from the standpoint of abstract theory, the ruin of the small producers in a society of developingcommodity economy and capitalism means the very oppositeto what Messrs. 
 N. 
—on and V. 
 V. 
 want to deduce therefrom; it means the creation and not the shrinkage of the home market. 
 If the very same Mr. 
 N. 
—on, who declares a priorithat the ruin of the Russian small producers means the shrinkage of the home market, nevertheless cites the just-quoted contrary assertions of Marx ( Sketches , pp. 
 71 and 114), it only proves the remarkable ability of that writer to belabour himself with quotations from Capital . 
 IV. 
 THE NARODNIK THEORY OF THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF REALISING SURPLUS-VALUE The next question in the theory of the home market is the following. 
 We know that the value of a product in capitalistproduction resolves into three parts: 1) the first part replacesthe constant capital, i. 
e. 
, the value that existed previouslyin the shape of raw and auxiliary materials, machines and instruments of production, etc. 
, and that is merely reproduced in a certain part of the finished product; 2) thesecond part replaces the variable capital, i. 
e. 
, covers themaintenance of the worker; and, lastly, 3) the third partconstitutes the surplus-value, which belongs to the capital-ist. 
 It is usually granted (we state the question in the spirit of Messrs. 
 N. 
—on and V. 
 V. 
) that the realisation (i. 
e. 
, the finding of a corresponding equivalent, sale in the market)of the first two parts presents no difficulty, because thefirst part goes into production, and the second into consump-tion by the working class. 
 But how is the third part—surplus-value—realised? It cannot, surely, be consumed in its entirety by the capitalists! So our economists come to the conclusion that “the way out of the difficulty” of realis-ing surplus-value is “the acquisition of a foreign market”(N. 
—on, Sketches , Part II, §XV in general, and p. 
 205 in particular; V. 
 V. 
, “The Excess in the Market Supplyof Commodities” in Otechestvenniye Zapiski [Fatherland Notes ], 1883, and Essays on Theoretical Economics , St. 
 Petersburg, 1895, p. 
 179 and foll. 
). 
 The writers mentionedexplain the need for a capitalist nation to have a foreignmarket by the suggestion that the capitalists cannot realisetheir products in any other way. 
 The home market in Russia,they say, is shrinking because of the ruin of the peas-antry and because of the impossibility of realising surplus-value without a foreign market, while the foreign marketis closed to a young country that enters the path of capitalist development too late—and so, it is declared as proven that Russian capitalism has no basis, is still-born, a claim founded on mere a priori (and, moreover, theoret-ically incorrect) assumptions! When expressing his views on realisation, Mr. 
 N. 
—on evidently had in mind Marx’s theory on this subject(although he said not a single word about Marx in this partof his Sketches ), but he absolutely failed to understand it and distorted it beyond recognition, as we shall see in a moment. 
 This explains the curious fact that his viewscoincided in all essentials with those of Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
, whocannot possibly be accused of “not understanding” theory,for it would be the height of injustice to suspect him ofeven the slightest acquaintance with it. 
 Both authors expound their theories as though they are the first to have dealt with the subject, and have reached certain solutions“all by themselves”; both of them most sublimely ignore thearguments of the old economists on the subject, and bothrepeat old errors that have been most thoroughly refuted inVolume II of Capital . 
 * Both authors reduce the whole problem of the realisation of the product to the realisation of surplus-value, evidently imagining that the realisationof constant capital presents no difficulties. 
 This naïve opin-ion contains a most profound error, one that is the sourceof all further errors in the Narodnik theory of realisation. 
 Asa matter of fact, the difficulty of explaining realisation is precisely one of explaining the realisation of constant cap-ital. 
 In order to be realised, constant capital must be putback again into production, and that is directly practicableonly in the case of that capital whose product consists ofmeans of production. 
 If, however, the product which makesgood the constant part of capital consists of articles of con-sumption, it cannot be directly put back into production; *Particularly astonishing in this connection is Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
’s audac-ity, which transcends all bounds of literary decency. 
 After enunciat-ing his theory, and betraying his utter unfamiliarity with Volume IIof Capital , which deals specifically with realisation, he goes on to make the quite unfounded statement that “in building up my propositions I used” Marx’s theory!! ( Essays on Theoretical Economics , Essay III. 
 “The Capitalist Law (sic!?!) of Production, Distributionand Consumption,” p. 
 162. 
) what is required is exchange between the department of social production that makes means of production and that which makes articles of consumption. 
 It is this point that constitutes the whole difficulty of the problem, a difficultyunnoticed by our economists. 
 Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
 presents the matter, generally speaking, as if the aim of capitalist productionis not accumulation but consumption, advancing the pro-found argument that “into the hands of a minority flows a mass of material objects in excess of the consuming power of the organism” (sic!) “at the given stage of their develop-ment” (loc. 
 cit. 
, 149) and that “it is not the moderation andabstemiousness of the manufacturers which are the causeof the superfluity of products, but the limitations andinsufficient elasticity of the human organism (!!), which fails to increase its consuming power at the rate at which surplus-value grows” (ibid. 
, 161). 
 Mr. 
 N. 
—on tries to presentthe matter as though he does not regard consumption as theaim of capitalist production, as though he takes account ofthe role and significance of means of production in regard tothe problem of realisation; as a matter of fact, however, he has no clear idea whatsoever about the process of the cir-culation and reproduction of the aggregate social capital,and has become entangled in a host of contradictions. 
We shall not stop to examine all these contradictions indetail (pp. 
 203-205 of Mr. 
 N. 
—on’s Sketches ); that would be too thankless a task (and one already performed in part by Mr. 
 Bulgakov * in his book Markets Under Capitalist Production , Moscow, 1897, pp. 
 237-245), and furthermore, to prove the justice of the appraisal given here of Mr. 
 N. 
—on’sarguments, it will suffice to examine his final conclu-sion, namely, that the foreign market is the way out of thedifficulty of realising surplus-value. 
 This conclusion of Mr. 
 N. 
—on’s (essentially a mere repetition of the one drawn by Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
) shows in most striking fashion that he did notin any way understand either the realisation of the productin capitalist society (i. 
e. 
, the theory of the home market) *It will not be superfluous to remind the contemporary reader that Mr. 
 Bulgakov, and also Messrs. 
 Struve and Tugan-Baranovsky, whom we shall quote rather often later on, tried to be Marxists in1899. 
 Now they have all safely turned from “critics of Marx” into plainbourgeois economists. 
 ( Note to 2nd edition . 
 18) or the role of the foreign market. 
 Indeed, is there even a grain of common sense in this dragging of the foreign mar-ket into the problem of “realisation”? The problem of real-isation is how to find for each part of the capitalist product,in terms of value (constant capital, variable capital andsurplus-value) and in its material form (means of production,and articles of consumption, specifically necessities and lux-uries), that other part of the product which replaces it on the market. 
 Clearly, foreign trade must here be excluded,- for dragging it in does not advance the solution of theproblem one iota, but merely retracts it by extending theproblem from one country to several. 
 The very same Mr. 
N. 
—on who discovered in foreign trade “the way out of thedifficulty” of realising surplus-value, argues about wages, for example, as follows: with the part of the annual product which the direct producers, the workers, receive in the shapeof wages “only that part of the means of subsistence can bedrawn from circulation which is equal in value to the sum-total of wages” (203). 
 How, the question arises, does oureconomist know that the capitalists of a given country will produce means of subsistence in just the quantity and of just the quality requisite for their realisation by wages?How does he know that in this connection the foreign marketcan be dispensed with? Obviously, he cannot know this,and has simply brushed aside the problem of the foreignmarket, for in discussing the realisation of variable capital the important thing is the replacement of one part of the product by another, and not at all whether this replacementtakes place in one country or in two. 
 With respect tosurplus-value, however, he departs from this necessary pre-mise, and instead of solving the problem, simply evades it bytalking of the foreign market. 
 The sale of the product in the foreign market itself needs explanation, i. 
e. 
, the finding of an equivalent for that part of the product which is beingsold, the finding of another part of the capitalist productthat can replace the first. 
 That is why Marx says that inexamining the problem of realisation, the foreign market,foreign trade “must be entirely discarded,” for “the involve-ment of foreign commerce in analysing the annually reproduced value of products can . 
 . 
 . 
 only confuse withoutcontributing any new element of the problem, or of its solution” ( Das Kapital , II, 469). 
19 Messrs. 
 V. 
 V. 
 and N. 
—on imagined that they were giving a profound appraisal of the contradictions of capitalism by pointing to the diffi-culties of realising surplus-value. 
 Actually, however, theywere giving an extremely superficial appraisal of thecontradictions of capitalism, for if one speaks of the “difficul-ties” of realisation, of the crises, etc. 
, arising therefrom,one must admit that these “difficulties” are not only possible but are necessary as regards all parts of the capitalist product, and not as regards surplus-value alone. 
 Difficultiesof this kind, due to disproportion in the distribution of thevarious branches of production, constantly arise, not onlyin realising surplus-value, but also in realising variableand constant capital; in realising not only the product consisting of articles of consumption, but also that consist-ing of means of production. 
 Without “difficulties” of thiskind and crises, there cannot, in general, be any capitalistproduction, production by isolated producers for a worldmarket unknown to them. 
 V. 
 THE VIEWS OF ADAM SMITH ON THE PRODUCTION AND CIRCULATION OF THE AGGREGATE SOCIAL PRODUCT IN CAPITALIST SOCIETY AND ’S CRITICISM OF THESE VIEWS In order properly to understand the theory of realisation we must start with Adam Smith, who laid the foundationof the erroneous theory on this subject that held undividedsway in political economy until Marx. 
 Adam Smith dividedthe price of a commodity into only two parts: variable cap-ital (wages, in his terminology) and surplus-value (he does not combine “profit” and “rent,” so that actually he counted three parts in all. 
) * Similarly, he divided the sum-*Adam Smith, An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations , 4th ed. 
, 1801, Vol. 
 I, p. 
 75, Book I: “Of the Causes of Improvement in the productive Powers of Labor, and of the Orderaccording to which its Produce is naturally distributed among the different Ranks of the People,” Chapter VI, “Of the component Parts of the Price of Commodities,” Bibikov’s Russian translation (St. 
Petersburg, 1866), Vol. 
 I, p. 
 171. 
 total of commodities, the total annual social product, into the same parts and allocated them directly to the “revenue” of the two classes of society: the workmen and the capi-talists (undertakers and landlords, as Smith calls them). 
 * On what did he base his omission of the third compo-nent of value, constant capital? Adam Smith could notfail to observe this part, but he assumed that it also ismade up of wages and surplus-value. 
 Here is how he argued on this subject: “In the price of corn, for example, one part pays the rent of the landlord, another pays the wages ormaintenance of the labourers and labouring cattle employedin producing it, and the third pays the profit of the farmer. 
These three parts seem either immediately or ultimatelyto make up the whole price of corn. 
 A fourth part, it may perhaps be thought, is necessary for replacing the stock of the farmer, or for compensating the wear and tear of hislabouring cattle, and other instruments of husbandry. 
 Butit must be considered that the price of any instrument ofhusbandry, such as a labouring horse, is itself made up ofthe same three parts” (namely, rent, profit and wages). 
 “Though the price of the corn, therefore, may pay the price as well as the maintenance of the horse, the whole pricestill resolves itself either immediately or ultimately intothe same three parts of rent, labour and profit. 
” ** Marx calls this theory of Smith’s “astonishing. 
” “His proof consistssimply in the repetition of the same assertion” (II, S. 
 366). 
 20 Smith sends us “from pillar to post” (I. 
 B. 
, 2. 
 Aufl. 
, S. 
612 ***). 
21 In saying that the price of farming instruments itself resolves into the same three parts, Smith forgets to add: and also into the price of the means of productionemployed in the making of these instruments. 
 The erroneousexclusion by Adam Smith (and also by subsequent econo-mists) of the constant part of capital from the price of the product is due to an erroneous conception of accumulationin capitalist economy, i. 
e. 
, of the expansion of production,the transformation of surplus-value into capital. 
 Here tooAdam Smith omitted constant capital, assuming that the *Loc.

— Ed. 
 accumulated part of surplus-value, the part converted into capital, is entirely consumed by the productive workers, i. 
e. 
, goes entirely in wages, whereas actually the accumu-lated part of surplus-value is expended on constant capital(instruments of production, raw and auxiliary materials)plus wages. 
 Criticising this view of Smith (and also ofRicardo, Mill and others) in Capital , Volume I (Part VII, “The Accumulation of Capital,” Chapter 22, “Conversion of Surplus-Value into Capital,” §2, “Erroneous Conception, by Political Economy, of Reproduction on a ProgressivelyIncreasing Scale”), Marx there states that in Volume II“it will be shown that Adam Smith’s dogma, inherited by allhis successors, prevented political economy from understand-ing even the most elementary mechanism of the process of social reproduction” (I, 612). 
 22 Adam Smith committed this error because he confused the value of the product withthe newly created value: the latter does indeed resolve itselfinto variable capital and surplus-value, whereas the for-mer includes constant capital in addition. 
 This error had beenearlier exposed by Marx in his analysis of value, when he drew a distinction between abstract labour, which creates new value, and concrete, useful labour, which reproducesthe previously existing value in the new form of a usefulproduct. 
 23 An explanation of the process of the reproduction and circulation of the total social capital is particularly neces-sary to settle the problem of the national revenue in capital-ist society. 
 It is extremely interesting to note that, whendealing with the latter problem, Adam Smith could no longercling to his erroneous theory, which excludes constant cap-ital from the country’s total product. 
 “The gross revenueof all the inhabitants of a great country comprehends the whole annual produce of their land and labor; the neat revenue, what remains free to them after deducting theexpense of maintaining; first, their fixed; and, secondly, theircirculating capital; or what, without encroaching upon theircapital, they can place in their stock reserved for immediateconsumption, or spend upon their subsistence, conveniencies, and amusements” (A. 
 Smith, Wealth of Nations , Book II. 
 “Of the Nature, Accumulation, and Employment of Stock,”Chapter II, Vol. 
 II, p. 
 18. 
 Russ. 
 trans. 
, II, p. 
 21). 
 Thus, from the country’s total product Adam Smith excluded capital, asserting that it resolves itself into wages, profit and rent, i. 
e. 
, into (net) revenue; but in the gross revenue of society he includes capital, separating it from articles of consump-tion (=net revenue). 
 This is the contradiction in which Marx catches Adam Smith: how can there be capital in the revenue if there was no capital in the product ? (Cf. 
 Das Kapital , II, S. 
 355. 
)24 Without noticing it himself, Adam Smith here recognises three component parts in the value of the total product: not only variable capital and surplus-value, but also constant capital. 
 Further on, Adam Smithcomes up against another very important difference, one ofenormous significance in the theory of realisation. 
 “Thewhole expense of maintaining the fixed capital,” he says, “must evidently be excluded from the neat revenue of the society. 
 Neither the materials necessary for supporting theiruseful machines and instruments of trade, their profitablebuildings, etc. 
, nor the produce of the labor necessary for fashioning those materials into the proper form , can ever make any part of it . 
 The price of that labor may indeed make a part of it; as the workmen so employed may place the whole value of their wages in their stock reserved for imme-diate consumption. 
” But in other kinds of labour, both the“price” (of labour) “and the produce” (of labour) “go tothis stock, the price to that of the workmen, the produce tothat of other people” (A. 
 Smith, ibid. 
). 
 Here we find a gleam of recognition of the need to distinguish two kinds of labour: one that produces articles of consumption which may enterinto the “neat revenue,” and another which produces “usefulmachines and instruments of trade . 
 . 
 . 
 buildings, etc. 
,”i. 
e. 
, articles that can never be used for personal consump-tion. 
 From this it is only one step to the admission that an explanation of realisation absolutely requires that two forms of consumption be distinguished: personal and produc-tive ( =putting back into production). 
 It was the rectification of these two mistakes made by Smith (the omission of con-stant capital from the value of the product, and theconfusing of personal with productive consumption) that enabled Marx to build up his brilliant theory of the realisation of the social product in capitalist society. 
 As for the other economists, those between Adam Smith and Marx, they all repeated Adam Smith’s error * and for that reason did not advance one step. 
 Of the confusion that consequently reigns in the theories of revenue we shall speak later. 
 In the controversy as to the possibility of ageneral overproduction of commodities that was waged byRicardo, Say, Mill and others, on the one hand, and byMalthus, Sismondi, Chalmers, Kirchmann and others, onthe other, both sides adhered to Smith’s erroneous theory, and consequently, as Mr. 
 S. 
 Bulgakov justly remarks, “in view of the false premises and the wrong formulation ofthe problem itself, these controversies could only lead toempty and scholastic wordspinning” (loc. 
 cit. 
, p. 
 21. 
 Seean account of this wordspinning in Tugan-Baranovsky’sIndustrial Crises , etc. 
, St. 
 Petersburg, 1894, pp. 
 377-404). 
 VI. 
 ’S THEORY OF REALISATION It follows automatically from what has been said that the fundamental premises on which Marx’s theory is based are the following two propositions. 
 The first is that the totalproduct of a capitalist country, like the individual product,consists of the following three parts: 1) constant capital,2) variable capital, and 3) surplus-value. 
 To those who arefamiliar with the analysis of the process of production of capital given in Vol. 
 I of Marx’s Capital this proposition is self-evident. 
 The second proposition is that two majordepartments of capitalist production must be distinguished,namely (Department I), the production of means of produc-tion—of articles which serve for productive consumption,i. 
e. 
, are to be put back into production, articles which are consumed, not by people, but by capital; and (Department II) the production of articles of consumption, i. 
e. 
, of articlesused for personal consumption. 
 “There is more theoreti-cal meaning in this division alone than in all the preceding *For example, Ricardo asserted that “the whole produce of the land and labour of every country is divided into three portions: ofthese, one portion is devoted to wages another to profits, and the other to rent” ( Works , Sieber’s translation, St. 
 Petersburg, 1882, p. 
 221. 
 controversies over the theory of markets” (Bulgakov, loc. 
 cit. 
, p. 
 27). 
 The question arises as to why such a division of products according to their natural form is now necessary to analyse the reproduction of social capital, when the anal-ysis of the production and reproduction of individual capitaldispensed with such a division and left the question ofthe natural form of the product entirely on one side. 
 On whatgrounds can we introduce the question of the natural form of the product into a theoretical investigation of capitalist economy, which is based entirely on the exchange-valueof the product? The fact is that when the production ofindividual capital was analysed, the question of whereand how the product would be sold, and of where and howarticles of consumption would be bought by the workers and means of production by the capitalists, was set aside as making no contribution to this analysis and as having norelation to it. 
 All that had to be examined then was the prob-lem of the value of the separate elements of production andof the results of production. 
 Now, however, the question is:where will the workers and the capitalists obtain their articles of consumption, where will the capitalists obtain their means of production, how will the finished productmeet all these demands and enable production to expand?Here, consequently, we have not only “a replacement ofvalue, but also a replacement in material” (Stoffersatz. 
—Das Kapital , II, 389), 25 and hence it is absolutely essen-tial to distinguish between products that play entirely different parts in the process of social economy. 
 Once these basic propositions are taken into account, the problem of the realisation of the social product in cap-italist society no longer presents any difficulty. 
 Let usfirst assume simple reproduction, i. 
e. 
, the repetition of the process of production on its previous scale, the absence of accumulation. 
 Obviously, the variable capital and thesurplus-value in Department II (which exist in the form ofarticles of consumption) are realised by the personal con-sumption of the workers and capitalists of this department(for simple reproduction presumes that the whole of the surplus-value is consumed, and that no portion of it is con-verted into capital). 
 Further, the variable capital and thesurplus-value which exist in the form of means of production (Department I) must, in order to be realised, be exchanged for articles of consumption for the capitalists and workers engaged in the making of means of production. 
 On the other hand, neither can the constant capital existing in the formof articles of consumption (Department II) be realisedexcept by an exchange for means of production, in order tobe put back again into production the following year. 
 Thuswe get variable capital and surplus-value in means of pro-duction exchanged for constant capital in articles of consumption: the workers and the capitalists (in the meansof production department) in this way obtain means ofsubsistence, while the capitalists (in the articles of con-sumption department) dispose of their product and obtainconstant capital for further production. 
 Under simple repro-duction, the parts exchanged must be equal: the sum of variable capital and surplus-value in means of productionmust be equal to the constant capital in articles of consump-tion. 
 On the other hand, if we assume reproduction on aprogressively increasing scale, i. 
e. 
, accumulation, the firstmagnitude must be greater than the second, because there must be available a surplus of means of production with which to begin further production. 
 Let us revert, however, to simple reproduction. 
 There has been left unrealised onemore part of the social product, namely, constant capital inmeans of production. 
 This is realised partly by exchangeamong the capitalists of this same department (coal, for example, is exchanged for iron, because each of these products serves as a necessary material or instrument in the produc-tion of the other), and partly by being put directly intoproduction (for example, coal extracted in order to be usedin the same enterprise again for the extraction of coal;grain in agriculture, etc. 
). 
 As for accumulation, its starting-point, as we have seen, is a surplus of means of production (taken from the surplus-value of the capitalists in thisdepartment), a surplus that also calls for the conversioninto capital of part of the surplus-value in articles ofconsumption. 
 A detailed examination of how this additionalproduction will be combined with simple reproduction we consider to be superfluous. 
 It is no part of our task to under-take a special examination of the theory of realisation, andthe foregoing is enough to elucidate the error of the Narodnik economists and to enable us to draw certain theoretical conclusions regarding the home market. 
 * On the problem of interest to us, that of the home market, the main conclusion from Marx’s theory of realisation isthe following: capitalist production, and, consequently, thehome market, grow not so much on account of articles ofconsumption as on account of means of production. 
 In otherwords, the increase in means of production outstrips the increase in articles of consumption. 
 Indeed, we have seen that constant capital in articles of consumption (Depart-in means of production (Department I). 
 According, however,grows faster than variable capital. 
 Hence, constant capital able capital and surplus-value in articles of consumption, fastest of all, outstripping both the increase of variableincrease of constant capital in articles of consumption. 
 The production has, consequently, to grow faster than that producing articles of consumption. 
 For capitalism, there-fore, the growth of the home market is to a certain extent“independent” of the growth of personal consumption, andtakes place mostly on account of productive consumption. 
 But it would be a mistake to understand this “independence” as meaning that productive consumption is entirely divorcedfrom personal consumption: the former can and must increase *See Das Kapital , II. 
 Band, III. 
 Abschn. 
,26 where a detailed investigation is made of accumulation, the division of articles of consumption into necessities and luxuries, the circulation of money, the wear and tear of fixed capital, etc. 
 Readers who are unable tofamiliarise themselves with Volume II of Capital are recommended to read the exposition of Marx’s theory of realisation contained inMr. 
 S. 
 Bulgakov’s book quoted above. 
 Mr. 
 Bulgakov’s exposition ismore satisfactory than that of Mr. 
 M. 
 Tugan-Baranovsky ( Industrial Crises , pp. 
 407-438), who in building up his schemes has made some very ill-judged departures from Marx and has inadequately explainedMarx’s theory; it is also more satisfactory than the exposition givenby Mr. 
 A. 
 Skvortsov ( Fundamentals of Political Economy , St. 
 Peters-burg, 1898, pp 281-295), who holds wrong views on the very impor-tant questions of profit and rent. 
while constant capital in means of production has to increase department of social production which produces means ofcapital ( # surplus-value) in means of production and thein articles of consumption has to increase faster than vari-ment II) is exchanged for variable capita l#surplus-value to the general law of capitalist production, constant capital faster than the latter (and there its “independence” ends), but it goes without saying that, in the last analysis, produc-tive consumption is always bound up with personal con-(Book II, Part III) that continuous circulation takes place between constant capital and constant capital. 
 . 
 . 
” which is realised by exchange among capitalists in the same consumption because it never enters the latter. 
 But this consumption definitely limits it nevertheless, since constantcapital is never produced for its own sake but solely becausemore of it is needed in spheres of production whose productsgo into individual consumption” ( Das Kapital , III, 1, 289. 
 Russ. 
 trans. 
, p. 
 242). 
 27 This larger consumption of constant capital is nothing but a higher level of the development of the productiveforces, one expressed in terms of exchange-value, because therapidly developing “means of production” consist, in themain, of materials, machines, instruments, buildings and all sorts of other accessories for large-scale, especially machine, production. 
 It is quite natural, therefore, thatcapitalist production, which develops the productive forcesof society and creates large-scale production and machineindustry, is also distinguished by a particular expansionof that department of social wealth which consists of means of production. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 “In this case” (namely, the production of means of production), “what distinguishes capitalist societyfrom the savage is not, as Senior thinks, the privilege and peculiarity of the savage to expend his labour at times in a way that does not procure him any products resolvable(exchangeable) into revenue, i. 
e. 
, into articles of consump-tion. 
 No, the distinction consists in the following: “a) Capitalist society employs more of its available annual labour in the production of means of production(ergo, of constant capital) which are not resolvable intorevenue in the form of wages or surplus-value, but canfunction only as capital. 
 “b) When a savage makes bows, arrows, stone hammers, axes, baskets, etc. 
, he knows very well that he did notspend the time so employed in the production of articlesdepartment).

We have seen (Marx has in mind constant capital in means of production, of consumption, but that he has thus stocked up the means of production he needs, and nothing else” ( Das Kapital , II, 436. 
 Russ. 
 trans. 
, 333). 
28 This “very good knowledge” of one’s relation to production has disappeared in capi-talist society owing to the latter’s inherent fetishism, whichpresents the social relations of men as relations of products—owing to the conversion of every product into a commodityproduced for an unknown consumer and to be realised in an unknown market. 
 And as it is a matter of the utmost indiffer-ence to the individual entrepreneur what kind of article he produces—every product yields a “revenue,”—this samesuperficial, individual point of view was adopted by theeconomist-theoreticians in relation to the whole of societyand prevented the process of the reproduction of the total social product in capitalist economy from being understood. 
 The development of production (and, consequently, of the home market) chiefly on account of means of productionseems paradoxical and undoubtedly constitutes a contra-diction. 
 It is real “production as an end in itself”—theexpansion of production without a corresponding expansion of consumption. 
 But it is a contradiction not of doctrine, but of actual life; it is the sort of contradiction that corre-sponds to the very nature of capitalism and to the other con-tradictions of this system of social economy. 
 It is thisexpansion of production without a corresponding expansionof consumption that corresponds to the historical mission of capitalism and to its specific social structure: the former consists in the development of the productive forces ofsociety; the latter rules out the utilisation of these technicalachievements by the mass of the population. 
 There is anundoubted contradiction between the drive towards theunlimited extension of production inherent in capitalism, and the limited consumption of the masses of the people (limited because of their proletarian status). 
 It is this con-tradiction that Marx records in the propositions so readilyquoted by the Narodniks and which are supposed to corrob-orate their views on the shrinkage of the home market, thenon-progressive character of capitalism, etc. 
, etc. 
 Here are some of these propositions: “Contradiction in the capitalist mode of production: the labourers as buyers of commoditiesare important for the market. 
 But as sellers of their own commodity—labour-power—capitalist society tends to keep them down to the minimum price” ( Das Kapital , II, 303). 
29 portional relation of the various branches of productionand the consumer power of society. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 But the more produc-tiveness develops, the more it finds itself at variance withthe narrow basis on which the conditions of consumptionrest” (ibid. 
, III, 1, 225-226). 
 30 “The limits within which the preservation and self-expansion of the value of capitalresting on the expropriation and pauperisation of the greatmass of producers can alone move—these limits comecontinually into conflict with the methods of productionemployed by capital for its purposes, which drive towardsunlimited extension of production, towards production as an end in itself, towards unconditional development of the social productivity of labour. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 The capitalist mode of pro-duction is, for this reason, a historical means of developingthe material forces of production and creating an appro-priate world market, and is, at the same time, a continualconflict between this its historical task and its own corre-sponding relations of social production. 
” (III, 1, 232. 
 Russ. 
 trans. 
, p. 
 194). 
 31 “The ultimate reason for all real crises always remains the poverty and restricted consumption ofthe masses as opposed to the drive of capitalist production todevelop the productive forces as though only the absoluteconsuming power of society constituted their outer limit” * *It is this passage that the famous Ed. 
 Bernstein (famous after the fashion of Herostratos) quoted in his Premises of Socialism (Die Voraussetzungen , etc. 
, Stuttgart, 1899, S. 
 67). 
32 Our opportunist, of course, turning away from Marxism towards the old bourgeois economics, hastened to announce that this is a contradiction in Marx’stheory of crises, that Marx’s view “does not differ very much fromRodbertus’s theory of crises. 
” Actually, however, the only “contra-diction” here is between Bernstein’s pretentious claims, on the one hand, and his senseless eclecticism and refusal to delve into the mean-ing of Marx’s theory, on the other. 
 How far Bernstein failed to under-stand the theory of realisation is evident from his truly strangeargument that the enormous increase in the aggregate surplus productmust necessarily imply an increase in the number of affluent people (or an improvement in the living standard of the workers), for the capitalists themselves, if you please, and their “servants” (sic! Seite 51-52) cannot “consume” the entire surplus product!! ( Note to 2nd edition . 
)“. 
 . 
 . 
The conditions of realisation are limited by the pro-(III, 2, 21. 
 Russ. 
 trans. 
, p. 
 395). 
33 These propositions all speak of the contradiction we have mentioned, namely, the contradiction between the unrestricted drive to expand production and limited consumption—and of nothing else. 
 * Nothing could be more senseless than to conclude from thesepassages in Capital that Marx did not admit the possibility of surplus-value being realised in capitalist society, that heattributed crises to under-consumption, and so forth. 
 Marx’s analysis of realisation showed that the circulation between constant capital and constant capital is definitely limitedby personal consumption; but this same analysis showed thetrue character of this “limitedness,” 34 it showed that, compared with means of production, articles of consumptionplay a minor role in the formation of the home market. 
 And, furthermore, there is nothing more absurd than to conclude from the contradictions of capitalism that the latter isimpossible, non-progressive, and so on—to do that is to takerefuge from unpleasant, but undoubted realities in the tran-scendental heights of romantic dreams. 
 The contradictionbetween the drive towards the unlimited expansion of production and limited consumption is not the only contra-diction of capitalism, which cannot exist and develop atall without contradictions. 
 The contradictions of capitalismtestify to its historically transient character, and makeclear the conditions and causes of its collapse andtransformation into a higher form; but they by no means rule out either the possibility of capitalism, or its progressive character as compared with preceding systems of socialeconomy. 
 ** VII. 
 THE THEORY OF THE NATIONAL INCOME Having outlined the main propositions of Marx’s theory of realisation, we still have briefly to point to its enormous importance in the theory of national “consumption,” *Mr. 
 Tugan-Baranovsky is mistaken in thinking that in advan-cing this proposition Marx contradicts his own analysis of realisation (see article “Capitalism and the Market” in Mir Bozhy [God’s Earth ] 1898, No. 
 6, p. 
 123). 
 Marx does not contradict himself at all, for theconnection between productive consumption and personal consump-tion is also indicated in the analysis of realization. 
 **Cf. 
 “A Characterisation of Economic Romanticism. 
 Sismondi and Our Native Sismondists. 
” (See present edition, Vol. 
 2. 
— Ed. 
) “distribution,” and “income”. 
 All these problems, particularly the last, have hitherto been a veritable stumbling-block for economists. 
 The more they have spoken and written about it, the greater has been the confusion caused by AdamSmith’s fundamental error. 
 We shall cite here someexamples of this confusion. 
 It is interesting to note, for example, that Proudhon repeated essentially the same error, except that he formulated the old theory somewhat differently. 
 He said: “A (which stands for all property owners, entrepreneurs and capitalists) starts an enterprise with 10,000 francs,and with them makes advance payment to the workers, whomust produce goods in return; after A has thus convertedhis money into commodities he must, at the end of the production process, at the end, say, of a year, convert the commodities again into money. 
 To whom does he sell hiscommodities? To the workers, of course, for there are onlytwo classes in society—the entrepreneurs on the one hand,and the workers on the other. 
 These workers, having for theproduct of their labour received 10,000 francs as pay, which covers their essential requirements of life, must now, how-ever, pay more than 10,000 francs, that is, they must payfor the addition that A receives in the shape of the interestand other profits he counted on at the beginning of the year. 
The worker can cover these 10,000 francs only by borrowing,and, as a consequence, he sinks deeper and deeper into debt and poverty. 
 One of two things must necessarily take place: either the worker may consume 9, although he produced 10,or he pays the entrepreneur only the amount of his wages,in which case the entrepreneur himself suffers bankruptcyand disaster, for he does not receive interest on capital,which he on his part, however, must pay. 
” (Diehl, Proudhon, II, 200, quoted from the compilation “Industry. 
” Articles from Handwörterbuch der Staatswissenschaften , * Moscow, 1896, p. 
 101. 
) As the reader sees, this is the same difficulty—how surplus-value is to be realised—that Messrs. 
 V. 
 V. 
 and N. 
—on arefussing over. 
 Proudhon only expressed it in a somewhatspecific form. 
 And this specific character of his formulation *Dictionary of Political Sciences. 
— Ed. 
 brings our Narodniks still closer to him: they too, like Proudhon, consider the “difficulty” to lie in the realisation of surplus-value (interest or profit, in Proudhon’s terminol-ogy) and do not understand that the confusion they haveacquired from the old economists prevents them from explain-ing the realisation not only of surplus-value, but also ofconstant capital , i. 
e. 
, that their “difficulty” is in their not understanding the whole process of the realisation of the product in capitalist society. 
 Regarding this “theory” of Proudhon’s, Marx sarcastically observes: “Proudhon exposes his inability to grasp this” (namely, the realisation of the product in capitalist society) “inthe ignorant formulation: l’ouvrier ne peut pas racheter son propre produit (the labourer cannot buy back his own prod-uct), because the interest which is added to the prix-de-revient (cost-price) is contained in the product” ( Das Kapital , III, 2, 379. 
 Russ. 
 trans. 
, 698, in which there are mistakes). 
 35 And Marx quotes the remark directed against Proudhon by a certain vulgar economist named Forcade, who “quite correctly generalises the difficulty put forward in so narrowa form by Proudhon. 
” Forcade said that the price of commod-ities contains not only something over and above thewages—the profit—but also the part that replaces constantcapital. 
 Hence, concludes Forcade in opposition to Proudhon, the capitalist is also unable to buy back commodities with his profit (not only did Forcade not solvethe problem, he did not even understand it). 
 Neither did Rodbertus make any contribution to the solution of the problem. 
 While laying particular stress on thethesis that “ground-rent, profit on capital and wages are income,” * he proved quite unable to arrive at a clear under-standing of the concept “income. 
” Stating his view as towhat the tasks of political economy would have been hadit pursued “a correct method” (loc. 
 cit. 
, S. 
 26), he also speaksabout the distribution of the national product. 
 “It” (i. 
e. 
, *Dr. 
 Rodbertus-Jagetzow, Zur Beleuchtung der sozialen Frage , Berlin, 1875, S. 
 72 u. 
 ff. 
 ( On the Elucidation of the Social Problem , Berlin, p. 
 72 and foll. 
— Ed. 
) the true “science of the national economy”—Rodbertus’s italics) “should have shown how out of the total national product one part always goes to replace the capital consumed in production or worn out, while the other, as national income , goes to satisfy the direct requirements of society and of its members” (ibid. 
, S. 
 27). 
 But although true science shouldhave shown this, Rodbertus’s “science” did nothing of thekind. 
 The reader will see that he merely repeated Adam Smith word for word, evidently not even seeing that this is only the beginning of the problem. 
 Which workers“replace” the national capital? How is their product realised?Not a word did he say about this. 
 Summing up his theory(diese neue Theorie, die ich der bisherigen gegenüberstelle, * S. 
 32) in the shape of separate theses, Rodbertus first speaks of the distribution of the national product as follows: “Rent” (by this, as we know, Rodbertus meant what is usuallytermed surplus-value) “and wages are, consequently, the partsinto which the product resolves itself, in so far as it isincome” (S. 
 33). 
 This extremely important reservation shouldhave suggested a very vital question to him: he had only just said that by income he meant articles which serve “to satisfy direct requirements”; hence, there are products thatdo not serve for personal consumption. 
 How are they real-ised? But Rodbertus sees no unclarity here and soon forgetsthis reservation, speaking outright of the “ division of the product into three parts ” (wages, profit and rent) (S. 
 49-50 and others). 
 Thus Rodbertus virtually repeated AdamSmith’s theory together with his fundamental mistake andexplained nothing at all regarding the question of income. 
The promise of a new, full and better theory of the distribu-tion of the national product ** proved to be just empty talk. 
 As a matter of fact, Rodbertus did not advance the theory *—this new theory, which I set against those that have existed hitherto.

 bin ich genötigt der vorstehenden Skizze of this subject a single step. 
 How confused were his concep-tions of “income” is shown by his lengthy speculations in his Fourth Social Letter to von Kirchmann ( Das Kapital , Berlin, 1884) about whether money should be included in the national income, and whether wages are taken from capital or fromincome—speculations of which Engels said that they “belongto the domain of scholasticism” (Vorwort to Vol. 
 II, Cap-ital, S. 
 XXI). 
 *36 Utter confusion on the problem of the national income reigns supreme among economists to this day. 
 For example,in his article on “Crises” in Handwörterbuch der Staats-wissenschaften (the afore-mentioned compilation, p. 
 81), Herkner, speaking of the realisation of the product in capi-talist society (§5, “distribution”), expresses the opinion that the speculations of K. 
 H. 
 Rau are “sound,” although he merely repeats Adam Smith’s mistake by dividing the wholeproduct of society into incomes. 
 R. 
 Meyer, in his article on“income” (ibid. 
, p. 
 283 and foll. 
), quotes the confuseddefinitions of A. 
 Wagner (who also repeats Adam Smith’serror) and frankly admits that “it is difficult to distinguish income from capital,” and that “the most difficult thing is to distinguish between returns (Ertrag) and income (Ein-kommen). 
” We thus see that the economists who have discoursed at length on the inadequate attention paid by the classicaleconomists (and Marx) to “distribution” and “consumption” have not been able to give the slightest explanation of the most fundamental problems of “distribution” and “consump-tion. 
” That is understandable, for one cannot even discuss“consumption” unless one understands the process of thereproduction of the total social capital and of the replace-ment of the various component parts of the social product. 
 This example once again proved how absurd it is to single out “distribution” and “consumption” as though they wereindependent branches of science corresponding to certainindependent processes and phenomena of economic life. 
It is not with “production” that political economy deals, *That is why K. 
 Diehl is absolutely wrong when he says that Rodbertus presented “a new theory of the distribution of income. 
”(Handwörterbuch der Staatswissenschaften , Art. 
 “Rodbertus,” B. 
 V. 
, S. 
 448. 
) /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR but with the social relations of men in production, with the social system of production. 
 Once these social relations have been ascertained and thoroughly analysed, the place in pro-duction of every class, and, consequently, the share they getof the national consumption, are thereby defined. 
 And the solution of the problem which brought classical politicaleconomy to a halt, and which has not been advanced ahair’s breadth by all sorts of experts on “distribution” and “consumption,” is provided by the theory which comes directly after those of the classical economists and whichcompletes the analysis of the production of capital, individ-ual and social. 
 The problem of “national income” and of “national consumption,” which is absolutely insoluble when examined independently, and has engendered nothing but scholastic speculations, definitions and classifications, proves to besolved in its entirety when the process of the production ofthe total social capital has been analysed. 
 Furthermore, itceases to exist as a separate problem when the relation ofnational consumption to the national product and the realisation of each separate part of this product have been ascertained. 
 All that remains is to give names to these sep-arate parts. 
 “In order to avoid unnecessary difficulty, one should distinguish gross output (Rohertrag) and net output fromgross income and net income. 
 “The gross output, or gross product, is the total reproduced product. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 “The gross income is that portion of value and that por-tion of the gross product” (Bruttoprodukts oder Rohprodukts)measured by it which remains after deducting that portionof value and that portion of the product of total production measured by it which replaces the constant capital advanced and consumed in production. 
 The gross income, then, isequal to wages (or the portion of the product destined toagain become the income of the labourer) +profit+rent. 
 The net income, on the other hand, is the surplus-value, and thus the surplus-product, which remains after deducting wages, and which, in fact, thus represents the surplus-value realised by capital and to be divided with the land-lord, and the surplus-product measured by it. 
 gross income. 
 But even this is an abstraction to the extent that the entire society, on the basis of capitalist production,bases itself on the capitalist standpoint and thereby consid-ers only the income resolved into profit and rent as netincome” (III, 2, 375-376. 
 Russ. 
 trans. 
, pp. 
 695-696). 
 37 Thus, the explanation of the process of realisation also made clear the question of income and removed the maindifficulty that had prevented the achievement of clarityon this question, namely: how does “income for one becomecapital for another”?, how can the product which consistsof articles of personal consumption and resolves itself totallyinto wages, profit and rent, also include the constant part of capital, which can never be income? The analysis of realisation given in Capital , Volume II, Part III, gave a full answer to these questions, and in the concluding part ofVolume III of Capital , which deals with “revenues,” Marx had only to give names to the separate parts of the socialproduct and refer the reader to the analysis given in Volume II. 
 * VIII. 
 WHY DOES THE CAPITALIST NATION NEED A FOREIGN MARKET? Regarding the above-stated theory of the realisation of the product in capitalist society, the question may arise: Does not this theory contradict the proposition that thecapitalist nation cannot dispense with foreign markets? It must be remembered that the analysis given of the reali-sation of the product in capitalist society proceeded from the assumption that there is no foreign trade: this assump-tion has already been mentioned above and it has been shownto be essential in such an analysis. 
 Obviously, imports and exports would only have confused the issue, without in the *See Das Kapital , III, 2, VII. 
 Abschnitt: “Die Revenuen,” Chap-ter 49: “Zur Analyse des Produktionsprozesses” (Russ. 
 trans. 
, pp. 
 688-706). 
 Here Marx also points to the circumstances that preventedthe earlier economists from understanding this process (pp. 
 379-382.

 trans. 
, 698-700).

Viewing the income of the whole society, national least helping to clear up the problem. 
 The mistake made by Messrs. 
 V. 
 V. 
 and N. 
—on is that they bring in the foreign market to explain the realisation of surplus-value: while explaining absolutely nothing, this reference to the foreign market merely conceals their theoretical mistakes; that isone point. 
 Another point is that it enables them, with theaid of these mistaken “theories,” to avoid the need to explain the fact of the development of a home market for Russian capitalism. 
 * The “foreign market” merely serves them as a pretext for obscuring the development of capitalism (and, consequently, of the market) inside the country—a pretextall the more convenient in that it also relieves them of theneed to examine the facts which show that Russian capital-ism is winning foreign markets. 
 ** The need for a capitalist country to have a foreign market is not determined at all by the laws of the realisation of thesocial product (and of surplus-value in particular), but,firstly, by the fact that capitalism makes its appearance onlyas a result of widely developed commodity circulation , which transcends the limits of the state. 
 It is therefore impos-sible to conceive a capitalist nation without foreign trade, nor is there any such nation. 
 As the reader sees, this reason is of a historical order. 
 And the Narodniks could not escape it with a couple ofthreadbare phrases about “the impossibility of the capitalistsconsuming surplus-value. 
” Had they really wanted to raise the question of the foreign market, they would have had to examine the history of the development of foreign trade, thehistory of the development of commodity circulation. 
 Andhaving examined this history, they could not have, of course,depicted capitalism as a casual deviation from the path. 
 Secondly, the conformity between the separate parts of social production (in terms of value and in their naturalform) which was necessarily assumed by the theory of the *Mr. 
 very correctly observes in the above-quoted book: “Till now the cotton industry, which supplies the peasant market, has been growing steadily, so that the absolute diminution conceivable only theoretically” (pp, 214-215). 
 **Volgin, The Substantiation of Narodism in the Works of Mr.

 Petersburg, 1896, pp.

 N. 
—on talks about) “. 
 . 
 . 
is reproduction of social capital, and which is actually estab-lished only as the average magnitude of a number of con-tinual fluctuations—this conformity is constantly disturbed in capitalist society owing to the separate existence ofdifferent producers working for an unknown market. 
 Thevarious branches of industry, which serve as “markets” forone another, do not develop evenly, but outstrip one another,and the more developed industry seeks a foreign mar-ket. 
 This does not mean at all “the impossibility of the capitalist nation realising surplus-value,”—the profound con-clusion so readily drawn by the Narodnik. 
 It merely indicatesthe lack of proportion in the development of the differentindustries. 
 If the national capital were distributed differently , the same quantity of products could be realised within the country. 
 But for capital to abandon one sphere of industry and pass into another there must be a crisis in that sphere;and what can restrain the capitalists threatened by such acrisis from seeking a foreign market, from seeking subsidiesand bonuses to facilitate exports, etc. 
? Thirdly, the law of pre-capitalist modes of production is the repetition of the process of production on the previous scale, on the previous technical basis: such are the corvéeeconomy of the landlords, the natural economy of thepeasants, the artisan production of the industrialists. 
 The lawof capitalist production, on the contrary, is constant transfor-mation of the modes of production, and the unrestricted growth of the scale of production. 
 Under the old modes of production, economic units could exist for centuries withoutundergoing any change either in character or in size, andwithout extending beyond the landlord’s manor, the peasantvillage or the small neighbouring market for the rural arti-sans and small industrialists (the so-called handicraftsmen). 
 The capitalist enterprise, on the contrary, inevitably out-grows the bounds of the village community, the local market,the region, and then the state. 
 Since the isolation andseclusion of the states have already been broken down bycommodity circulation, the natural trend of every capital-ist industry brings it to the necessity of “seeking a foreign market. 
” Thus, the necessity of seeking a foreign market by no means proves that capitalism is unsound, as the Narodnik economists like to picture matters. 
 Quite the contrary. 
 This necessity demonstrates the progressive historical work of capitalism, which destroys the age-old isolation and seclusion of systems of economy (and, consequently, thenarrowness of intellectual and political life), and whichlinks all countries of the world into a single economicwhole. 
 From this we see that the two latter causes of the need for a foreign market are again causes of a historical char-acter. 
 In order to understand them one must examine eachseparate industry, its development within the country, itstransformation into a capitalist industry—in short, onemust take the facts about the development of capitalism in the country; and it is not surprising that the Narodniks take the opportunity to evade these facts under cover of worthless (and meaningless) phrases about the “impossibility” ofboth the home and the foreign markets. 
 IX. 
 CONCLUSIONS CHAPTER I Let us now sum up the theoretical propositions examined above, which have a direct bearing on the problem of thehome market. 
 1) The basic process of the formation of a home market (i. 
e. 
, of the development of commodity production and ofcapitalism) is the social division of labour. 
 This consists of various forms of processing raw materials (and various operations in this processing) separating from agricultureone after another and becoming independent branchesof industry, which exchange their products (now commod-ities ) for the products of agriculture. 
 Thus, agriculture itself becomes industry (i. 
e. 
, produces commodities), and the same process of specialisation takes place in it. 
 2) A direct conclusion from the preceding proposition is the law governing all developing commodity economy, andthe more so capitalist economy—the industrial (i. 
e. 
, non-agricultural) population grows faster than the agricul-tural and diverts an ever-growing part of the population from agriculture to manufacturing industry. 
 3) The separation of the direct producer from the means of production, i. 
e. 
, his expropriation, signifying the transition from simple commodity production to capitalist production (and constituting the necessary condition for this transition), creates the home market. 
 The process of this creation of the home market proceeds in two directions: on the one hand, the means of production from which the small producer is “freed” are converted into capital in the handsof their new owner, serve to produce commodities and,consequently, are themselves converted into commodities. 
 Thus, even the simple reproduction of these means of pro-duction now requires that they be purchased (previously,these means of production were reproduced in greater partin the natural form and partly were made at home), i. 
e. 
,provides a market for means of production, and then theproduct now produced with the aid of these means of pro-duction is also converted into a commodity. 
 On the other hand, the means of subsistence of the small producer become the material elements of the variable capital, i. 
e. 
, ofthe sum of money expended by the employer (whether alandowner, contractor, lumber-dealer, factory owner, etc. 
,makes no difference) on hiring workers. 
 Thus, these means of subsistence are now also converted into commodities, i. 
e. 
, create a home market for articles of consumption. 
 4) The realisation of the product in capitalist society (and, consequently, the realisation of surplus-value) cannotbe explained without clearing up the point—1) that thesocial product, like the individual product, resolves itself in terms of value into three parts and not two (constant capital +variable capital +surplus-value, and not only into variable capital +surplus-value, as taught by Adam Smith and the entire school of political economy that came afterhim and before Marx), and 2) that in its natural form it mustbe divided into two big departments: means of production (consumed productively) and articles of consumption (con-sumed personally). 
 By establishing these main theoreticalpropositions, Marx fully explained the process of realisationof the product in general and of surplus-value in particularin capitalist production, and revealed that it is utterlywrong to drag the foreign market into the problem of real-isation. 
 5) Marx’s theory of realisation also threw light on the problem of national consumption and income. 
 From what has been said above, it follows automatically that the problem of the home market as a separate, self-sufficient problem not depending on that of the degree of capitalist development does not exist at all. 
 That is whyMarx’s theory does not anywhere or ever raise this problemseparately. 
 The home market appears when commodityeconomy appears; it is created by the development of thiscommodity economy, and the degree to which the social division of labour is ramified determines the level of its development; it spreads with the extension of commodityproduction from products to labour-power, and only in pro-portion as the latter is transformed into a commodity doescapitalism embrace the entire production of the country,developing mainly on account of means of production, which occupy an increasingly important place in capitalist society. 
 The “home market” for capitalism is created by developingcapitalism itself, which deepens the social division of labourand resolves the direct producers into capitalists and work-ers. 
 The degree of the development of the home market isthe degree of development of capitalism in the country. 
 To raise the question of the limits of the home market separate-ly from that of the degree of the development of capitalism(as the Narodnik economists do) is wrong. 
 That is why the question of how a home market is being formed for Russian capitalism reduces itself to the follow-ing: How and in what direction are the diverse aspects of the Russian national economy developing? What consti-tutes the connection between and interdependence of thesediverse aspects? The next chapters will be devoted to an examination of data containing the answers to these questions. 
 C H A P T E R II THE DIFFERENTIATION OF THE PEASANTRY We have seen that in capitalist production the basis for the formation of a home market is the process of the disin-tegration of the small cultivators into agricultural entre-preneurs and workers. 
 Almost every work on the economic position of the Russian peasantry in the post-Reform period refers to the so-called “differentiation” of the peasantry. 
 Itmust consequently be our task to study the principalfeatures of this phenomenon and to determine its significance. 
In the following exposition we employ the statistical dataof Zemstvo house-to-house censuses.

 ZEMSTVO STATISTICS FOR NOVOROSSIA41 Mr. 
 V. 
 Postnikov, in his book Peasant Farming in South Russia (Moscow, 1891),42 has collected and processed the Zemstvo statistics for the Taurida and partly the Kherson and the Ekaterinoslav gubernias. 
 This book should be given first place in the literature on the differentiation of thepeasantry, and we consider it necessary to arrange accord-ing to the system we have adopted the data gatheredby Mr. 
 Postnikov, supplementing them occasionally withdata from Zemstvo publications. 
 The Zemstvo statisti-cians of Taurida have grouped the peasant households according to area under crops—a very sound method, onethat renders it possible to form a precise judgement of theeconomy of each group due to the predominance in thatlocality of grain cultivation with extensive farming. 
 Here are the general data for the economic groups of the Taurida peasantry.

 Further, there are the middle peasants, also con-stituting about e of the total households, who cover their average expenditure by income from the land (Mr. 
 Post-nikov considers that a family requires from 16 to 18 dessia-tines under crops to cover its average expenditure). 
 Lastly, there are the well-to-do peasants (about 5 of the households and /FL0128 of the population), who concentrate in their hands over half the area cultivated, the crop area per householdclearly indicating the “commercial” character of the farmingdone by this group. 
 In order exactly to estimate the extent of this commercial agriculture in the various groups, *The following data relate mostly to the three northern mainland uyezds of Taurida Gubernia, namely the Berdyansk, Meli-topol and Dnieper, or to the latter one alone.

 Postnikov employs the following method. 
 From the total crop area of the farm, he separates the following: the food area (which provides sustenance for the family and the farm labourers), the fodder area (which provides fodder for thecattle) and the farm-service area (seed-plot, land occupiedby buildings, etc. 
), and thus arrives at the size of the market or commercial area, the produce of which goes for sale. 
 It is shown that in the group with 5 to 10 dess. 
 under crops, only 11. 
8% of the cultivated area yields produce for the market, whereas this percentage grows with the increase inthe area under crops (by groups) as follows: 36. 
5%—52%—61%. 
 Consequently, the well-to-do peasants (the top twogroups) engage in what is commercial cultivation, andsecure a gross money income ranging from 574 to 1,500 rubles per annum. 
 This commercial cultivation then becomes cap-italist farming, for the areas cultivated by the well-to-dopeasants exceed the family labour norm (i. 
e. 
, the amount ofland that a family can cultivate by its own labour), andcompel them to resort to the hiring of workers : in the three northern uyezds of Taurida Gubernia, the author estimates, the well-to-do peasants hire over 14,000 rural workers. 
 The poor peasants, on the contrary, “provide workers” (over5,000), that is, resort to the sale of their labour-power, sincethe income from cultivating the land amounts, in the 5to 10 dess. 
 group, for example, to only about 30 rubles incash per household. 
 * We observe here, consequently, the very process of the creation of a home market that is dealt with by the theory of capitalist production—the “homemarket” grows as a result of the conversion into a commodityof the product of commercial, entrepreneur farming, on theone hand, and of the conversion into a commodity ofthe labour-power sold by the badly-off peasants, on the other. 
 In order to acquaint ourselves more closely with this phenomenon, let us examine the position of each separategroup of the peasantry. 
 Let us start with the top group. 
Here are the data for the amount of land it owns and uses: *Mr. 
 Postnikov rightly observes that in reality the differences between the groups as to size of money income from the land aremuch more considerable, for the computations assume 1) equal yield,and 2) equal price for grain sold, actually, however, the well-to-dopeasants secure better yields and sell their grain to greater advantage.

9 We see, accordingly, that the well-to-do peasants, not-withstanding the fact that they are best provided with allot-ment land,43 concentrate in their hands the bulk of the purchased and the rented land and turn into small land-owners and capitalist farmers. 
 * On the renting of 17 to 44 dess. 
 of land there is an annual expenditure, at local prices,of about 70 to 160 rubles. 
 Obviously we are dealing herewith a commercial transaction: the land becomes a commod-ity, “a money-making machine.

0 *We would point out that the relatively considerable amount of purchased land held by those who cultivate no land is due to the fact that this group includes shopkeepers, owners of industrial estab-lishments, and so forth. 
 The mixing of such “peasants” with real cul-tivators is a common defect of Zemstvo statistics. 
 We shall referagain to this defect later on. 
 **Carting: carts, covered and open waggons, etc. 
 Ploughing: iron ploughs, scarifiers (cultivators), etc. 
 Thus the well-to-do peasantry are far better supplied with implements than the poor and even the middle peasantry. 
 It is sufficient to glance at this table to see how totally fictitious are the “average” figures which people are sofond of bringing into play when they talk of the “peasantry”. 
The commercial cultivation of the peasant bourgeoisie isaccompanied here by commercial livestock farming, namely,the breeding of coarse-wool sheep. 
 Regarding implements, we shall quote in addition figures for improved implements, which we have taken from Zemstvo statistical returns. 
 * Out of the total reaping and mowing machines (3,061),2,841, or 92. 
8%, belong to the peasant bourgeoisie ( 5 o f the total households). 
 It is quite natural that the well-to-do peasantry also employ a farming technique much above the average (larger size of farm, more plentiful supply of implements, availablefinancial resources, etc. 
); that is to say, the well-to-dopeasants “do their sowing faster, make better use of favour-able weather, sow the seed in more humid soil,” and reaptheir harvest in proper time; they thresh their grain as it is carted in from the field, etc. 
 It is also natural that the expenditure on the production of agricultural producediminishes (per unit of product) as the size of the farm increases. 
 Mr. 
 Postnikov proves this proposition in particular detail, using the following system of calculation: he deter-mines the number of people working (including hiredlabourers), the number of draught animals, implements, etc. 
,per 100 dessiatines of crop area in the various groups ofthe peasantry. 
 It is proved that these numbers diminish asthe size of the farm increases. 
 For example, those culti-vating under 5 dessiatines have per 100 dessiatines ofallotment land 28 people working, 28 draught animals, 4. 
7ploughs and scarifiers, and 10 carts, whereas those culti-vating over 50 dessiatines have 7 people working, 14 draughtanimals, 3. 
8 ploughs and scarifiers, and 4. 
3 carts. 
 (We omitmore detailed data for all groups, referring those interestedin the details to Mr. 
 Postnikov’s book. 
) The author’s general *Statistical Returns for Melitopol Uyezd , Simferopol, 1885 (Statistical Returns for Taurida Gubernia , Vol. 
 I),44—Statistical Returns for Dnieper Uyezd , Vol. 
 II, Simferopol, 1886. 
 conclusion is: “With the increase in the size of the farm and in the area cultivated by the peasant, the expenditure on the maintenance of labour-power, human and animal, that prime item of expenditure in agriculture, progressivelydecreases, and, among the groups that cultivate large areas,drops to nearly one half per dessiatine under crops of theexpenditure among the groups with small cultivated areas”(op. 
 cit. 
, p. 
 117). 
 To this law of the greater productivity and, hence, of the greater stability of the big peasant farms Mr. 
 Postnikov quite rightly attaches great importance, provingit with very detailed data not only for Novorossia alone,but also for the central gubernias of Russia. 
 * The further the penetration of commodity production into crop culti-vation, and, consequently, the keener the competition among the agriculturists, the struggle for land and for economic independence, the more vigorously must this law be man-ifested, a law which leads to the ousting of the middle andpoor peasants by the peasant bourgeoisie. 
 It must, however,be noted that technical progress in agriculture expressesitself in different ways, depending on the system of agri-culture, on the system of field cultivation. 
 Whereas in the case of grain growing and extensive cultivation this progressmay find expression in a mere expansion of the crop area *“Zemstvo statistics prove incontrovertibly that the larger the scale of the peasant farm, the smaller the number of implements, workers, and draught animals employed on a given tillage area”(op. 
 cit. 
, p. 
 162). 
 It is interesting to note how this law is reflected in Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
’s arguments. 
 In the above-quoted article ( Vestnik Yevropy , 1884, No. 
 7) he makes the following comparison: In the central black-earth belt there are 5-7-8 dess. 
 of arable per peasant horse, whereas “according to the rules of three-field crop rotation” there should be 7-10 dess. 
 (Ba-talin’s Calendar ). 
 “Consequently, the decline in horse-ownership by part of the population of this area of Russia must to a certain extentbe regarded as the restoration of the normal proportion between thenumber of draught animals and the area to be cultivated” (p. 
 346 in the article mentioned). 
 Thus the ruin of the peasantry leads to progress in agriculture. 
 Had Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
 paid attention not only to theagronomic but also to the social-economic aspect of this process hecould have seen that this is the progress of capitalist agriculture,for “the restoration of the normal proportion” between draught ani-mals and arable is achieved either by landlords who acquire their own implements, or by big peasant crop growers, i. 
e. 
, by the peasant bourgeoisie. 
 and reduction of the number of workers, animals, etc. 
, per unit of crop area, in the case of livestock or industrial-crop farming, with the adoption of intensive agriculture, this same progress may find expression, for example, in thecultivation of root crops, which require more workers perunit of crop area, or in the acquisition of dairy cattle, thecultivation of fodder grasses, etc. 
, etc. 
 The description of the top group of the peasantry must be supplemented by indicating the considerable employment of wage-labour.

9 100 Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
, in the above-mentioned article, argued about this question as follows: he took the farms employing work-ers as a percentage of the total number of peasant farms and arrived at the conclusion that “the number of peasants resorting to hired labour for the cultivation of the land, ascompared to the aggregate mass of the people, is quite insig-nificant: 2 to 3, a maximum of 5 peasant farmers out of 100are all that represent peasant capitalism . 
 . 
 . 
 it” (peasantfarming in Russia employing labourers) “is not a system firmly rooted in contemporary economic life, but something fortuitous, such as occurred 100 and 200 years ago” ( Vestnik Yevropy , 1884, No. 
 7, p. 
 332). 
 What sense is there in com-paring the number of farms employing workers with thetotal number of “peasant” farms, when the latter figurealso includes the plots of farm labourers? Why, by this method one could also get rid of capitalism in Russian industry: one would only need to take the families engagingin industries who employ wage-workers (i. 
e. 
, the families{ of manufacturers, large and small) as a percentage of the total number of families engaging in industries in Russia; the result would be a “quite insignificant” percentage of the “mass of the people. 
” It is far more correct to compare thenumber of farms employing labourers with the number ofactually independent farms, i. 
e. 
, of those living on agricul-ture alone and not resorting to the sale of their labour-power. 
 Furthermore, Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
 lost sight of a trifle, namely, that the peasant farms employing labourers are among the biggest: the percentage of farms employing labourers,“insignificant” when taken “in general and on the average,”turns out to be very imposing (34-64%) among the well-to-dopeasantry, who account for more than half of the total pro-duction and produce large quantities of grain for sale. 
 One can therefore judge how absurd is the opinion that farming based on the employment of labourers is “fortuitous,” some-thing that occurred 100 to 200 years ago! Thirdly, onlyby disregarding the real specific features of cultivation canone take as the criterion of “peasant capitalism” only farmlabourers, i. 
e. 
, regular workers, and ignore the day labour-ers. 
 It is commonly known that the hiring of day labourers plays a particularly important role in agriculture. 
 * Let us take the bottom group. 
 It consists of peasants who cultivate no land or who cultivate little; they “do not differmuch in economic status . 
 . 
 . 
 both groups serve as farmlabourers for their fellow villagers, or engage in outside, mainly agricultural employments” (p. 
 134, op. 
 cit. 
), i. 
e. 
, belong to the rural proletariat. 
 Let us note, for example,that in Dnieper Uyezd the bottom group constitutes 40%of the households, and those having no ploughing implements39% of the total households. 
 In addition to selling theirlabour-power, the rural proletariat obtain an income from leasing their allotment land: *England is the classic land of agricultural capitalism. 
 And in that country 40. 
8% of the farmers employ no hired labour; 68. 
1%employ not more than 2 workers; 82% employ not more than 4 workers (Yanson, Comparative Statistics , Vol. 
 II, pp. 
 22-23; quoted from Kablukov, The Workers in Agriculture , p. 
 16). 
 But he would be a fine economist, indeed, who forgot the mass of agricultural proletarians, both migratory and also resident (i. 
e. 
, such as get “employments” in their own villages), who hire themselves out by the day.

9 In the three uyezds of Taurida Gubernia, the land leased (in 1884-86) amounted to 25% of the total peasant arable; this does not include land leased, not to peasants, but tomiddle-class intellectuals. 
 In all, nearly 3 of the popula-tion in these three uyezds lease land; the allotments of therural proletariat are rented mainly by the peasant bour-geoisie. 
 Here are data in this regard: In three uyezds of Taurida Gubernia allotment land rented from neighbors (dessiatines) as % by peasants cultivating up to 10 dess .

 Land is leased, or sold, for one or two years and for longer periods—8, 9 or 11 years”(p. 
 139, op.

 Thus, the peasant bourgeoisie is also arepresentative of merchant’s and usurer’s capital. 
 * Here we have a striking refutation of the Narodnik prejudice *And itself resorts to the “very numerous” village banks and loan-and-savings societies, which render “substantial assistance” to “prosperous peasants. 
” “The economically weak peasants cannot find guarantors and do not get loans” (p. 
 368, op. 
 cit. 
). 
 that the “kulak” and the “usurer” have nothing in common with the “enterprising muzhik. 
” On the contrary, the threads both of merchant’s capital (the loaning of money on the security of land, the buying-up of various products, etc. 
) and of industrial capital (commercial agriculture with the aid of wage-workers, etc,. 
) merge in the hands of the peasant bourgeoisie. 
 It depends on surrounding circumstances, on the greater or lesser degree to which the Asiatic way of life is eliminated and culture is widespread in our countryside as to which of these forms of capital will develop at the expense of the other. 
 Let us examine, finally, the position of the middle group (cultivating from 10 to 25 dess. 
 per household, with an aver-age of 16. 
4 dess. 
). 
 Its position is a transitional one: its money income from agriculture (191 rubles) is somewhat lower than the sum annually spent by the average Taurid-ian (200 to 250 rubles). 
 Here draught animals work out at3. 
2 head per household, whereas for a full team 4 are required. 
Hence the position of the middle peasant’s farm is an unstableone, and to till his land he has to resort to “yoking. 
” *45 The cultivation of the land on a “yoking” basis is, it goes without saying, less productive (time lost in moving fromplace to place, shortage of horses, etc. 
), so that in onevillage, for example, Mr. 
 Postnikov was informed that“yokers often scarify no more than one dessiatine per day,which is half the normal rate. 
” ** If to this we add that in the middle group about 5 of the households have no plough-ing implements, that this group provides more workersthan it hires (according to Mr. 
 Postnikov’s calculations),its unstable character and its transitional position between *In Melitopol Uyezd, out of 13,789 households in this group only 4,218 till their land with their own animals; 9,201 “yoke. 
” InDnieper Uyezd, out of 8,234 households, 4,029 till the land with their own animals, and 3,835 “yoke. 
” See Zemstvo statistical returns for Melitopol Uyezd (p. 
 B. 
 195) and for Dnieper Uyezd (p. 
 B. 
 123). 
 **In the above-mentioned article Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
 argues a great deal about yoking being the “principle of co-operation,” etc. 
 It is reallyso simple to hush up the fact that the peasantry are breaking up intosharply distinct groups, that yoking is the co-operation of tottering farms which are being ousted by the peasant bourgeoisie, and then to talk in general about the “principle of co-operation”—probablyco-operation between the rural proletariat and the rural bourgeoisie! the peasant bourgeoisie and the rural proletariat will be clear. 
 We shall quote somewhat more detailed data about the ousting of the middle group (see Table on p. 
 81). 
 Thus, the distribution of allotment land is the most “equalised,” although here, too, the ousting of the bottomgroup by the top ones is marked. 
 But the situation radicallychanges when we pass from this compulsorily-held land to the free, i. 
e. 
, to the purchased and the rented land. 
 The concentration of this land is enormous, and as a result, the distribution of the total land in use by the peasants isquite unlike the distribution of the allotment land: themiddle group is pushed into second place (46% of allotmentland—41% of land in use), the well-to-do group very consid-erably enlarges its holdings (28% of allotment land—46% of land in use), while the poor group is being pushed out of the ranks of the cultivators (25% of allotment land—12%of land in use). 
 The table reveals an interesting phenomenon, one that we shall meet again, namely, the decline in the role ofallotment land in peasant farming. 
 In the bottom group this is due to the leasing out of land; in the top group to the fact that in the total farming area purchased and rentedland is overwhelmingly predominant. 
 The remnants of thepre-Reform system (the tying of the peasants to the land,and equalised, tax-assessed land tenure) are being utterlydestroyed by the penetration of capitalism into agricul-ture. 
 As for land renting in particular, the figures given enable us to clear up a very common mistake in the arguments ofthe Narodnik economists on this subject. 
 Take the argumentsof Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
 In the article quoted above he bluntly raisedthe issue of the relation of the renting of land to the break-up of the peasantry. 
 “Does the renting of land help to differentiate the peasant farms into big and small and todestroy the average, typical group?” ( Vestnik Yevropy , loc. 
 cit. 
, pp. 
 339-340. 
) Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
 answered this question in thenegative. 
 Here are his arguments: 1) “The large percentage ofpersons who resort to the renting of land. 
” Examples: 38 to 68%; 40 to 70%; 30 to 66%; 50 to 60% respectively in differ-ent uyezds of different gubernias.

23 The question arises, of what importance can “average” figures be here? Does the fact that those who rent land are “many”—56%—really do away with the concentration ofthe rented land in the hands of the rich? Is it not ridiculous to take the “average” area of rented land [12 dess. 
 per renting household. 
 Very often it is not even per renting household, but per existing household that is taken. 
 That is what Mr. 
 Karyshev, for example, does in his work “Peasant Rentings of Non-Allotment Land” (Dorpat, 1892; Vol. 
 II of Results of Zemstvo Statistical Investigations )] by putting together peas-ants of whom one takes 2 dessiatines at a fabulous price (15 rubles), evidently out of dire need, on ruinous terms, while another takes 48 dessiatines , over and above his own adequate amount of land, “buying” the land wholesale at the incompar-ably lower price of 3. 
55 rubles per dessiatine? No less hol-low is the third argument: Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
 himself took care to refute it by admitting that figures relating “to entire village communities” (in classifying the peasants according to allot-ment) “do not present a true picture of what is taking place in the community itself” (p. 
 342, op. 
 cit. 
). 
 ** *The data for the Melitopol and Berdyansk uyezds are analo-gous. 
 **Mr. 
 Postnikov cites an interesting example of a similar mistake It would be a great mistake to imagine that the concentra-tion of rented land in the hands of the peasant bourgeoisie is limited to individual renting and does not apply to rent-ing by the village community. 
 Nothing of the kind. 
 Therented land is always distributed “according to where the money lies,” and the relation between the groups of the peas-antry does not change in the least where land is rented by the community. 
 Hence, the argument of Mr. 
 Karyshev, for example, that the relation between community renting and individual renting expresses a “conflict between two prin-ciples (!?), the communal and the individual” (p. 
 159, loc. 
 cit. 
), that community renting “is characterised by the labour prin-ciple and the principle of even distribution of rented land among the community members” (ibid. 
, 230)—this argument belongs entirely to the sphere of Narodnik prejudices. 
 Not-withstanding the task he set himself of summing up the “results of Zemstvo statistical investigation,” Mr. 
 Kary-shev carefully avoided all the abundant Zemstvo statistical material about the concentration of rented land in the hands of small groups of well-to-do peasants. 
 Let us quote an example. 
 In the three indicated uyezds of Taurida Gubernia, state lands rented by peasant communities are distributed among the groups as follows: made by Zemstvo statisticians. 
 Noting the fact of commercial farming by the well-to-do peasants and their demand for land, hepoints out that “the Zemstvo statisticians, evidently regarding suchmanifestations in peasant life as something illegitimate, try tobelittle their importance” and to prove that the renting of land is deter-mined not by the competition of rich peasants but by the peasants’need for land. 
 To prove this, Mr. 
 Werner, the compiler of Taurida Gubernia Handbook (1889), classified the peasants of the entire Taurida Gubernia according to size of allotment , taking the group of peasants with 1 or 2 people working and 2 or 3 draught animals. 
 It turned outthat, within the bounds of this group, as the size of the allotmentincreases the number of renting households and the amount of rentedland decrease. 
 Obviously, such a method of calculation proves nothingat all, since only peasants with an equal number of draught animalsare taken, and it is the extreme groups that are omitted. 
 It is quitenatural that where the number of draught animals is equal the amountof cultivated land must also be equal, and consequently, the smallerthe allotment, the larger the amount of rented land. 
 The question is how the rented land is distributed among households with unequal numbers of draught animals, implements, etc.

7 A little illustration of the “labour principle” and of the “principle of even distribution”! Such are the Zemstvo statistical data on peasant farming in South Russia. 
 No room is left by these data for doubtingthe complete differentiation of the peasantry, the complete domination in the countryside of the peasant bourgeoisie. 
 * Highly interesting, therefore, is the attitude of Messrs. 
 V. 
 V. 
 and N. 
 —on towards these data, the more so that formerly both these writers admitted the need of raising the problemof the differentiation of the peasantry (Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
 in the above-mentioned article of 1884, and Mr. 
 N. 
 —on in Slovo [The Word ] in 1880, when he remarked on the interesting phenome-non in the village community itself that the “unenterpris-ing” muzhiks neglect their land, while the “enterprising”ones take the best land for themselves; cf. 
 Sketches , p. 
 71). 
 It should be noted that Mr. 
 Postnikov’s work is of a dualcharacter: on the one hand the author skilfully gathered and carefully processed extremely valuable Zemstvo statistics and managed, in doing so, to escape the “tendency to regardthe peasant community as something integral and homoge-neous, as it is still held to be by our urban intelligentsia”(p. 
 351, op. 
 cit. 
). 
 On the other hand, the author, not beingguided by theory, failed totally to appraise the data he had processed, and regarded them from the extremely narrow point of view of “measures,” proceeding to concoct projects *It is usually said that the data for Novorossia do not permit the drawing of general conclusions, because of the specific featuresof that locality. 
 We do not deny that the differentiation of the agri-cultural peasantry is more marked here than in the rest of Russia;but it will be seen from what follows that the specific nature ofNovorossia is by no means so great as is sometimes imagined. 
{ { about “agricultural-handicraft-factory communities” and about the necessity of “restricting,” “enjoining,” “observing,” etc. 
, etc. 
 Well then, our Narodniks did their best to ignore the first, the positive part of Mr. 
 Postnikov’s work and con-centrated their attention on the second part. 
 Both Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
and Mr. 
 N. 
 —on began with highly serious air to “refute” Mr. 
 Postnikov’s absolutely unserious “projects” (Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
 inRusskaya Mysl [Russian Thought ], 1894, No. 
 2; Mr. 
 N. 
 —on in his Sketches , p. 
 233, footnote), accusing him of the evil intention of introducing capitalism into Russia, and carefullyavoiding the data which revealed the prevalence of capita-list relations in the countryside of South Russia today. 
 * II. 
 ZEMSTVO STATISTICS FOR SAMARA GUBERNIA From the country’s southern outer area let us pass to the eastern region, to Samara Gubernia. 
 Let us take NovouzenskUyezd, the last one investigated; in the statistical report forthis uyezd we find the most detailed classification of the peas-ants according to economic status. 
 ** Here are the general data on the groups of the peasantry (the data that followcover 28,276 allotment-holding households, numbering164,146 persons of both sexes, i. 
e. 
, only the Russianpopulation of the uyezd, without Germans or farm-steaders—householders who farm both on community land and on separate non-community farmsteads. 
 The inclusion *“It is interesting,” wrote Mr. 
 N. 
 —on, that Mr. 
 Postnikov “has projects for 60-dessiatine peasant farms. 
” But “since agriculturehas fallen into the hands of capitalists,” productivity of labour maygrow still more “tomorrow,” “and it will be necessary (!) to convertthe 60-dessiatine into 200-or 300-dessiatine farms. 
” You see how simple it is: because the petty bourgeoisie of today in our countryside will be threatened tomorrow by the big bourgeoisie, therefore M r . 
 N. 
 —on refuses to recognise either today’s petty or tomorrow’s big bourgeoisie! **Statistical Returns for Samara Gubernia , Vol. 
 VII, Novou-zensk Uyezd , Samara, 1890. 
 An analogous classification is also given for Nikolayevsk Uyezd (Vol. 
 VI, Samara, 1889), but the data are much less detailed. 
 The Combined Returns for Samara Gubernia (Vol. 
 VIII, Pt. 
 1, Samara, 1892) contains only a classification accordingto size of allotment, the unsatisfactory nature of which we shall dealwith later on.

 The concentration of animals is still greater than the concentration of area under crops; the well-to-do peasants evidently combine capitalist livestock raising with their large-scale capitalist cropping. 
 At the opposite pole we have “peasants” who ought to be classed as allotment-hold-ing farm labourers and day labourers, for their main source of livelihood is the sale of their labour-power (as we shall see in a moment), and the landowners sometimes give one or two animals to their labourers to tie them down to their farms and to reduce wages. 
 It goes without saying that the peasant groups differ not only as to the size of their farms, but also in their methods of farming: firstly, in the top group a very large proportionof the peasant farmers (40 to 60%) are supplied withimproved implements (mainly iron ploughs, and also horse and steam threshers, winnowing machines, reapers, etc. 
). 
 In the hands of 24. 
7% of the households, the top group, are concen-trated 82. 
9% of the total improved implements; 38. 
2% of thehouseholds, the middle group, possess 17% of the improvedimplements; 37. 
1%, the poor, possess 0. 
1% (7 implementsout of 5,724). 
 * Secondly, the peasants with few horses are compelled by necessity to carry on “a different system offarming, a system of economic activity” entirely differentfrom that of the peasants with many horses, as the compilerof Returns for Novouzensk Uyezd says (pp. 
 44-46). 
 The well-to-do peasants “let their land rest .

 V. 
 V. 
 (Progressive Trends in Peasant Farming , St. 
 Petersburg, 1892, p. 
 225) concluded that there was a movement by the “peasant masses” to replace obsolete implements by improved ones (p. 
 254). 
 The methodby which this absolutely false conclusion was reached is very simple: Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
 took the total figures from the Zemstvo returns, without troubling to look at the tables showing how the implements weredistributed! The progress of the capitalist farmers (community mem-bers), who employ machines to cheapen the cost of producing commodity grain, is transformed by a stroke of the pen into the progressof the “peasant masses. 
” And Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
 did not hesitate to write “Although the machines are acquired by the well-to-do peasants; they are used by all (sic!!) the peasants” (221).

 they plough the same plot of land unwisely year afteryear, without allowing it to rest. 
” “And so on and so forthwithout end,” the compiler concludes this list. 
 “The factsenumerated concerning the radical difference between thefarming systems of the better-and the badly-off peasants result in grain of poor quality and bad harvests for the latter and comparatively better harvests for the former” (ibid. 
). 
 But how could such a big bourgeoisie arise under the agri-cultural community system? The answer is supplied by thefigures for land possessed and in use according to groups. 
The peasants in the section taken by us (76 households) have a total of 57,128 dess. 
 of purchased land and 304,514 dess. 
 of rented land, of which 177,789 dess. 
 are non-allotment landrented by 5,602 households; 47,494 dess. 
 of the allotmentland rented from other village communities are held by3,129 households, and 79,231 dess. 
 of the allotment land rentedin their own village communities are held by 7,092 house-holds. 
 The distribution of this enormous area of land, con-stituting more than q of the peasants’ total area under crops, is as follows (see Table on p. 
 89). 
 We see here an enormous concentration of purchased and rented land. 
 More than /FL0134 of the total purchased land is in the hands of 1. 
8% of the households, the very richest. 
 Of all the rented land, 69. 
7% is concentrated in the hands of peasant capitalists, and 86. 
6% is in the hands of the topgroup of the peasantry. 
 A comparison of the figures on therenting and the leasing-out of allotment land clearly revealsthe passage of the land into the hands of the peasant bourgeoi-sie. 
 Here, too, the conversion of the land into a commodity leads to the cheapening of the wholesale purchase price of land (and, consequently, to profiteering in land).

 To show what mistakes the Narodniks fall into by thus ignoringthe concentration of rented ]and, let us quote by way of example the arguments of Mr. 
 Karyshev in the well-known symposium The Influence of Harvests and Grain Prices on Certain Aspects of the Russian National Economy (St. 
 Peters-burg, 1897). 
 When grain prices fall, with an improvement of the harvest, and renting prices rise, the entrepreneur renters,concludes Mr. 
 Karyshev, have to reduce demand and hence the renting prices had been raised by the representatives of consumers’ economy (I, 288). 
 The conclusion is absolutely arbitrary: it is quite possible that the peasant bourgeoisie raise renting prices in spite of a drop in grain prices, for an improvement in the harvest may compensate for the drop in prices. 
 It is quite possible that the well-to-do peasantsraise renting prices even when there is no such compensa-tion, reducing the cost of production of grain by introducingmachinery. 
 We know that the employment of machines inagriculture is growing and that these machines are concen-trated in the hands of the peasant bourgeoisie. 
 Instead of studying the differentiation of the peasantry, Mr. 
 Karyshevintroduces arbitrary and incorrect premises about an averagepeasantry. 
 That is why all the conclusions and deductionssimilarly arrived at by him in the publication quoted are ofno value whatever. 
 Having ascertained that diverse elements exist among the peasantry, we can now easily get clarity on the question ofthe home market. 
 If the well-to-do peasants control aboutq of the total agricultural production, it is obvious that they must account for an incomparably larger share of thegrain on sale. 
 They produce grain for sale, whereas the badly-off peasants have to buy additional grain and sell their labour-power. 
 Here are the data: * *We identify with the sale of labour-power what the statisticians call “agricultural industries” (local and away from the village). 
 That by these “industries is meant employment as regular and day labourers is clear from the table of industries ( Combined Returns for Samara Gubernia , Vol. 
 VIII): of 14,063 males engaged in “agricultural industries,” 13,297 are farm labourers and day labourers (includingshepherds and ploughmen).

 “If the muzhik is prosper-ous, the factory flourishes, and vice versa” (V. 
 V. 
, Progressive Trends , p. 
 9). 
 Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
 is evidently not in the least inter-ested in the social form of the wealth which the “factory”needs and which is created only by the conversion of theproduct and the means of production, on the one hand, and oflabour-power, on the other, into a commodity. 
 Mr. 
 N. 
 —on, when speaking of the sale of grain, consoles himself with the thought that this grain is produced by the “muzhik-farmer” ( Sketches , p. 
 24), that by transporting this grain “the railways live at the expense of the muzhik” (p. 
 16). 
Really, are not these “community-member” capitalists“muzhiks”? “Some day we shall have occasion to point out,” wrote Mr. 
 N. 
 —on in 1880, and reprinted it in 1893, “that in the localities where communal land tenure prevails, agri-culture based on capitalist principles is almost completelyabsent (sic!!) and that it is possible only where communalties have either been entirely broken or are breaking down”(p. 
 59). 
 Mr. 
 N. 
 —on has never had this “occasion,” nor could he have had, for the facts point precisely to the development of capitalist agriculture among “community members ”* and *Novouzensk Uyezd, which we have taken as an illustration, reveals a particular “tenacity of the village community” (to use theterminology of Messrs. 
 V. 
 V. 
 & Co. 
): from the table in the Combined Returns (p. 
 26) we find that in this uyezd 60% of the communities have redivided the land, whereas in the other uyezds only 11 to 23% havedone so (for the gubernia 13. 
8% of the communities). 
% of house-holdersemployinghiredlabourers % of workingmalesengaged inagriculturalindustries to the complete adaptation of the notorious “communal ties” to the farms of big crop growers that employ labourers. 
 The relationship between the peasant groups proves to be absolutely analogous in Nikolayevsk Uyezd (cited statisticalreturns, p. 
 826 and foll. 
; we leave out those living away fromhome and the landless). 
 For example, 7. 
4%, the rich house-holds (having 10 and more draught animals), comprising13. 
7% of the population, concentrate in their hands 27. 
6% of the total livestock and 42. 
6% of the rented land, whereas 29%, the poor households (horseless and one-horse), compris-ing 19. 
7% of the population, have only 7. 
2% of the livestockand 3% of the rented land. 
 Unfortunately, the tables forNikolayevsk Uyezd, we repeat, are too scanty. 
 To finishwith Samara Gubernia, let us quote the following highly instructive description of the position of the peasantry from the Combined Returns for Samara Gubernia. 
 the Immigration of land-poor peasants from the westerngubernias, in connection with the appearance in the sphereof agricultural production of money-grubbing speculators in land, has with every passing year complicated the forms of the renting of land, raised its worth and converted the land into a commodity which has so quickly and immensely enriched some and ruined many others. 
 To illustrate the latter point, let us indicate the area cultivated by some of the south-ern merchant-and peasant-owned farms, where the tillage of 3,000 to 6,000 dessiatines is no rarity, while some prac-tise the cultivation of 8-10-15 thousand dessiatines of land, renting several tens of thousands of state-owned land. 
 “The existence and the growth of the agricultural (rural) proletariat in Samara Gubernia are to a considerable extent the product of recent times, with their increasing produc-tion of grain for sale, rise in renting prices, ploughing up of virgin and pasture land, clearing of forests, and so forth. 
 The landless households throughout the gubernia number 21,624 in all, whereas the non-farming ones number 33,772 (of those households that have allotments), while the horse-less and one-horse households together number 110,604 fami-lies, with a total of 600,000 persons of both sexes, counting five and a fraction persons per family. 
 We take the liberty of counting these, too, as proletarians, although legally they“. 
 . 
 . 
The natural increase in the population, augmented by have a share of communal land; actually, these are day labourers, ploughmen, shepherds, reapers and similar work-ers on big farms who cultivate 2 to 1 dessiatine of their own allotments so as to feed their families who remainat home” (pp. 
 57-58). 
 Thus, the investigators regard as proletarians not only the horseless peasants, but also those who have one horse. 
 Wenote this important conclusion, which fully coincides with that of Mr. 
 Postnikov (and with the data in the classified tables) and points to the real social-economic significance ofthe bottom group of the peasantry.

 The well-to-do peasantryhave also a considerable number of animals per household: 14. 
6 head (in terms of cattle, i. 
e. 
, counting 10 head of small domestic animals for one of cattle), and of the total numberof peasants’ cattle in the uyezd, nearly r (56%) is concen-trated in the hands of the peasant bourgeoisie. 
 At the oppo-site pole in the countryside, we find the opposite state ofaffairs; the complete dispossession of the bottom group, the rural proletariat, who in our example comprise a little less than 2 of the households (nearly 3 of the population), but who have only 8 of the total area under crops, and even less (11. 
8%) of the total number of animals. 
 These are mainlyallotment-holding farm labourers, day labourers and indus-trial workers. 
 Side by side with the concentration of crop areas and with the enhancement of the commercial character of agriculturethere takes place its transformation into capitalist agricul-ture. 
 We see the already familiar phenomenon: the sale of according to categories of peasants. 
—The Saratov statisticians com-piled their combined tables as follows: all the householders are divided into six categories according to size of allotment, each category is divided into six groups according to the number of draught ani-mals, and each group is divided into four subdivisions according to the number of working males in the family. 
 Summarised data aregiven only for the categories , so that we have to calculate those for the groups ourselves. 
 We shall deal with the significance of this table later on. 
 *Let us note that when classifying households according to eco-nomic strength, or to size of farm, we always get larger families among the well-to-do strata of the peasantry. 
 This phenomenon points to theconnection between the peasant bourgeoisie and large families,which receive a larger number of allotments; partly it shows the opposite: it indicates the lesser desire of the well-to-do peasantry to divide up the land. 
 One should not, however, exaggerate the signifi-cance of large families among the well-to-do peasants, who, as ourfigures show, resort in the greatest measure to the employment ofhired labour. 
 The “family co-operation” of which our Narodniks areso fond of talking is thus the basis of capitalist co-operation.

2 Here an important explanation is needed. 
 P. 
 N. 
 Skvortsov has quite rightly noted in one of his articles that Zem-stvo statistics attach far too “wide” a meaning to the term“industry” (or “employments”). 
 In fact, all sorts of occupa-tions engaged in by the peasants outside their allotments areassigned to the category of “industries”; factory ownersand workers, owners of flour mills and of melon fields, day labourers, regular farm labourers; buyers-up, traders and unskilled labourers; lumber-dealers and lumbermen; buildingcontractors and building workers; members of the liberalprofessions, clerks, beggars, etc. 
, all these are “industrial-ists”! This barbarous misuse of words is a survival of thetraditional—and we have the right even to say: official— view that the “allotment” is the “real,” “natural” occupation of the muzhik, while all other occupations are assignedindiscriminately to “outside” industries. 
 Under serfdom thisuse of the word had its raison d’être, but now it is a glaringanachronism. 
 Such terminology is retained partly becauseit harmonises wonderfully with the fiction about an “average” peasantry and rules right out the possibility of studying the differentiation of the peasantry (particularly in those placeswhere peasant “outside” occupations are numerous andvaried. 
 Let us remind the reader that Kamyshin Uyezd is anoted centre of the sarpinka industry 47). 
 The processing * o f *We say “ processing ” because the data on peasant industries col-lected in the house-to-house censuses are very comprehensive and detailed. 
% of peasantsemployingmale wage-workers % of farmsengaging inindustries household returns on peasant farming will be unsatisfactory so long as peasant “industries” are not classified according to their economic types, so long as among the “industrialists” employers are not separated from wage-workers . 
 This is the minimum number of economic types without discriminating between which economic statistics cannot be regarded as satisfactory. 
 A more detailed classification is, of course, desirable; for example; proprietors employing wage-work-ers—proprietors not employing wage-workers—traders, buyers-up, shopkeepers, etc. 
, artisans, meaning industrial-ists who work for customers, etc. 
 Coming back to our table, let us observe that after all we had some right to consider “industries” as being the sale of labour-power, for it is usually wage-workers who predominate among peasant “industrialists. 
” If it were possible to singlethe wage-workers out of the latter, we would, of course, obtain an incomparably smaller percentage of “industria-lists” in the top groups. 
 As to the data regarding wage-workers, we must note here the absolutely mistaken character of Mr. 
 Kharizomenov’sopinion that the “short-term hire [of workers] for reaping,mowing and day labouring, which is too widespread a phe-nomenon, cannot serve as a characteristic criterion of the strength or weakness of a farm” (p. 
 46 of “Introduction” tothe Combined Returns ). 
 Theoretical considerations, the example of Western Europe, and the facts of Russia (dealtwith below) compel us, on the contrary, to regard the hiringof day labourers as a very characteristic feature of the rural bourgeoisie. 
 Lastly, as regards rented land, the data show, here too, the same concentration of it in the hands of the peasant bourgeoi-sie. 
 Let us note that the combined tables of the Saratov sta-tisticians do not show the number of peasants who rent landand lease it out, but only the total land rented and leased out *; we have, therefore, to determine the amount of land rented and leased per existing , and not per renting household. 
 *The total amount of arable leased out in the uyezd is 61,639 dess. 
, i. 
e. 
, about 6, of the aggregate allotment arable (377,305 dess. 
).

5 100 100 100 100 Thus we see, here too, that the wealthier the peasants the more they rent land, despite the fact that they are better provided with allotment land. 
 Here too we see that the well-to-do are ousting the middle peasantry, and that the roleof allotment land in peasant farming tends to diminish at both poles of the countryside. 
 Let us examine in greater detail these data on land rent-ing. 
 With them are connected the very interesting andimportant investigations and arguments of Mr. 
 Karyshev(quoted Results ) and Mr. 
 N. 
 —on’s “corrections” to them. 
 Mr. 
 Karyshev devotes a special chapter (III) to “the depend-ence of land renting on the prosperity of the lessees. 
” The general conclusion he arrives at is that, “ other things being equal , the struggle for rentable land tends to go in favour of the better-off” (p. 
 156). 
 “The relatively more prosperous house-holds . 
 . 
 . 
 push the less prosperous ones into the background”(p. 
 154). 
 We see, consequently, that the conclusion drawn from a general review of Zemstvo statistical data is the same as that to which we are led by the data we are studying. 
 More-over, a study of the dependence of the amount of rented landon the size of the allotment led Mr. 
 Karyshev to the conclu-sion that classification according to allotment “obscures themeaning of the phenomenon that interests us” (p. 
 139): “land renting . 
 . 
 . 
 is more resorted to by a) the categories that are worse provided with land, but by b) the groups within them that are better provided. 
 Evidently, we have here two diametrically opposed influences, the confusion of whichAllotmentarableRentedland Leasedland Allotment Rented Leased { { { { prevents the understanding of either” (ibid. 
). 
 This conclusion follows naturally if we consistently adhere to the viewpoint that distinguishes the peasant groups according to economic strength ; we have seen everywhere in our data that the well-to-do peasants grab rentable land, despite the fact that theyare better provided with allotment land. 
 It is clear that thedegree of prosperity of the household is the determining factor in the renting of land, and that this factor merely undergoes a change but does not cease to be determining, with the change in the conditions of land allotment and renting. 
But, although Mr. 
 Karyshev investigated the influence of“prosperity,” he did not adhere consistently to the viewpointmentioned, and therefore characterised the phenomenoninaccurately , speaking of the direct connection between the degree to which the lessee is supplied with land and the rent-ing of land. 
 This is one point. 
 Another point is that the one-sidedness of Mr. 
 Karyshev’s investigation prevented himfrom appraising the full significance of the way rentable landis grabbed by the rich peasants. 
 In his study of “non-allot-ment renting”, he limits himself to summarising the Zemstvo statistics on land renting, without taking account of the les-sees’ own farms. 
 Naturally, with such a method of study, amore formal one, the problem of the relation between land rent-ing and the “prosperity,” of the commercial character of landrenting could not be solved. 
 Mr. 
 Karyshev, for example, wasin possession of the same data on Kamyshin Uyezd as we are, but he limited himself to reproducing absolute figures only of land renting (see Appendix No. 
 8, p. 
 XXXVI) and to cal-culating the average amount of rented land per allotment-holding household (text, p. 
 143). 
 The concentration of landrenting in the hands of the well-to-do peasants, its industri-al character, its connection with land leasing by the bottom group of the peasantry, were all overlooked. 
 Thus, Mr. 
 Ka-ryshev could not but see that the Zemstvo statistics refutethe Narodnik notion of land renting and show that the poorare ousted by the well-to-do peasants; but he gave an inac-curate description of this phenomenon, did not study it from all sides and came into conflict with the data, repeating theold song about the “labour principle,” etc. 
 But even the merestatement of the fact of economic discord and conflict amongthe peasantry seemed heresy to the Narodniks, and they pro-ceeded to “correct” Mr. 
 Karyshev in their own way. 
 Here is how Mr. 
 N. 
 —on does it, “using,” as he says (p. 
 153, note), Mr. 
 N. 
 Kablukov’s arguments against Mr. 
 Karyshev. 
 In §IX of his Sketches , Mr. 
 N. 
 —on discusses land renting and the various forms it assumes. 
 “When a peasant,” he says, “hassufficient land to enable him to obtain his livelihood bytilling his own, he does not rent any land” (152). 
 Thus, Mr. 
N. 
 —on flatly denies the existence of entrepreneur activity in peasant land renting and the grabbing of rentable land by rich peasants engaged in commercial crop growing. 
 His proof?Absolutely none: the theory of “people’s production” is notproved, but laid down as law. 
 In answer to Mr. 
 Karyshev, Mr. 
N. 
 —on quotes a table from the Zemstvo abstract for Khva-lynsk Uyezd showing that “the number of draught animals being equal, the smaller the allotment the more must this deficiency be compensated by renting” (153), * and again, “if the peasants are placed in absolutely identical condi-tions as regards the possession of animals, and if they havesufficient workers in their households, then the smaller theallotment they have, the more the land they rent” (154). 
 The reader will see that such “conclusions” are merely a quibble at Mr. 
 Karyshev’s inaccurate formulation, that Mr. 
 N. 
 —on’s empty trifles simply obscure the issue of the connectionbetween land renting and prosperity. 
 Is it not self-evidentthat where an equal number of draught animals is possessed, the less land a household has, the more it rents? That goes without saying, for it is the very prosperity whose differences are under discussion that is taken as equal. 
 Mr. 
 N. 
 —on’s assertion that peasants with sufficient land do not rent landis not in any way proved by this, and his tables merely showthat he does not understand the figures he quotes: by compar-ing the peasants as to amount of allotment land held, he brings out the more strikingly the role of “prosperity” and the grabbing of rentable land in connection with the leasing ofland by the poor (leasing it to these same well-to-do peasants,of course. 
) ** Let the reader recall the data we have quoted on *An exactly similar table is given by the statisticians for Kamyshin Uyezd. 
 Statistical Returns for Saratov Gubernia , Vol. 
 XI Kamyshin Uyezd, p. 
 249 and foll. 
 We can just as well, therefore, make use of the data for the uyezd we have taken. 
 **That the data quoted by Mr. 
 N. 
 —on refute his conclusions has already been pointed to by Mr. 
 P. 
 Struve in his Critical Remarks . 
 the distribution of rented land in Kamyshin Uyezd; imagine that we have singled out the peasants with “an equal number of draught animals” and, dividing them into categories according to allotment and into subdivisions according to the numberof persons working, we declare that the less land a peasanthas, the more he rents, etc. 
 Does such a method result inthe disappearance of the group of well-to-do peasants? YetMr. 
 N. 
 —on, with his empty phrases, has succeeded in bring-ing about its disappearance and has been enabled to repeat the old prejudices of Narodism. 
 Mr. 
 N. 
 —on’s absolutely useless method of computing the land rented by peasants per household according to groupswith 0, 1, 2, etc. 
, persons working is repeated by Mr. 
 L. 
Maress in the book The Influence of Harvests and Grain Prices , etc. 
 (I, 34). 
 Here is a little example of the “averages” boldly employed by Mr. 
 Maress (as by the other contributors to thisbook, written from a biassed Narodnik point of view). 
 InMelitopol Uyezd, he argues, the amount of rented land perrenting household is 1. 
6 dess. 
 in households having no workingmales, 4. 
4 dess. 
 in households having one working male, 8. 
3 in households having two, and 14. 
0 in households having three (p. 
 34). 
 And the conclusion is that there is an “ap-proximately equal per-capita distribution of rented land”!!Mr. 
 Maress did not think it necessary to examine the actual distribution of rented land according to groups of householdsof different economic strength, although he was in a position to learn this both from Mr. 
 V. 
 Postnikov’s book and from the Zemstvo abstracts. 
 The “average” figure of 4. 
4 dess. 
 of rentedland per renting household in the group of households havingone working male was obtained by adding together such figures as 4 dess . 
 in the group of households cultivating 5 to 10 dess. 
 and with 2 to 3 draught animals, and 38 dess . 
 in the group of households cultivating over 50 dess. 
 of land and with 4 and more draught animals. 
 (See Returns for Melitopol Uyezd,p. 
 D. 
 10-11. 
) It is not surprising that by adding together the rich and the poor and dividing the total by the number of itemsadded, one can obtain “equal distribution” wherever desired! Actually, however, in Melitopol Uyezd 21% of the house-holds, the rich ones (those with 25 dess. 
 and more under crops), comprising 29. 
5% of the peasant population,account—despite the fact that they are best provided with allotment and purchased land—for 66. 
3% of the total rented arable (Returns for Melitopol Uyezd, p. 
 B. 
 190-194). 
 On the other hand, 40% of the households, the poor ones (those with up to 10 dess. 
 under crops), comprising 30. 
1 % of the peasant population, account—despite the fact that they are worstprovided with allotment and purchased land—for 5. 
6% ofthe total rented arable. 
 As can be seen, this closely resembles“equal per-capita distribution”! Mr. 
 Maress bases all his calculations of peasant land-renting on the “assumption” that “the renting households are mainlyin the two groups worst provided” (provided with allotment land ; that “among the renting population there is equal per-capita (sic!) distribution of rented land”; and that “the rent-ing of land enables the peasants to pass from the groups worst provided to those best provided” (34-35). 
 We have already shown that all these “assumptions ” of Mr. 
 Maress directly contradict the facts . 
 Actually, the very contrary is the case, as Mr. 
 Maress could not but have noted, had he—indealing with inequalities in economic life (p. 
 35)—takenthe data for the classification of households according to eco-nomic indices (instead of according to allotment tenure ), and not limited himself to the unfounded “assumption” ofNarodnik prejudices. 
 Let us now compare Kamyshin Uyezd with other uyezds in Saratov Gubernia. 
 The ratios between the peasant groupsare everywhere the same, as is shown by the following data for the four uyezds (Volsk, Kuznetsk, Balashov and Serdobsk) in which, as we have said, the middle and the well-to-do peas-ants are combined: Four uyezds in Saratov Gubernia as % % of total Groups of householders With no draught animals24.

 But in Kamyshin Uyezd the well-to-do peasantry are more numerous and richer than in the other uyezds. 
 Thus, in five uyezds of the gubernia (including theKamyshin Uyezd) the households are distributed accordingto draught animals held as follows: with no draught animals—25. 
3%; with 1 animal—25. 
5%; with 2—20%; with 3—10. 
8%; and with 4 and more—18. 
4%, whereas in Kamyshin Uyezd, as we have seen, the well-to-do group is larger, and the badly-off group somewhat smaller. 
 Further, if we com-bine the middle and well-to-do peasantry, i. 
e. 
, if we takethe households with 2 draught animals and more, we get thefollowing data for the respective uyezds: Per household with 2 and more draught animals Draught animals ....

 This uyezd is one of those with the greatest abun-dance of land: 7. 
1 dess. 
 of allotment land per registered per-son, 48 male, as against 5. 
4 dess. 
 for the gubernia. 
 Hence, the land-abundance of the “peasantry” merely means the greater numbers and greater wealth of the peasant bourgeoisie. 
 In concluding this review of the data for Saratov Gubernia, we consider it necessary to deal with the classification of the peasant households. 
 As the reader has probably observed, wereject a limine * any classification according to allotment and exclusively employ classification according to economic strength (draught animals, area under crops). 
 The reasons foradopting this system must be given. 
 Classification according At once. 
— Ed. 
Kamyshin Volsk Kuznetsk Balashov Serdobsk to allotment is far more widespread in our Zemstvo sta-tistics, and in its defence the two following, at first sight very convincing, arguments are usually advanced. 
 * It is said, firstly, that to study the life of the agricultural peasantsit is natural and necessary to classify them according to land. 
This argument ignores a fundamental feature of Russian life,namely, the unfree character of allotment-land tenure,in that by force of law it bears an equalitarian character, and that the purchase and sale of allotment land is hindered in the extreme. 
 The whole process of the differentiation of theagricultural peasantry is one of real life evading these legalbounds. 
 In classifying the peasants according to allotment,we lump together the poor peasant who leases out land and the rich peasant who rents or buys land; the poor peasant whoabandons the land and the rich peasant who “gathers” land;the poor peasant who runs his most wretched farm with aninsignificant number of animals and the rich peasant whoowns many animals, fertilises his soil, introduces improve-ments. 
, etc. 
, etc. 
 In other words, we lump together the ruralproletarian and the members of the rural bourgeoisie. 
 The“averages” thus obtained obscure the differentiation , and are therefore purely fictitious. 
 ** The combined tables of the Sara-*See, for example, the introductions to the Combined Returns for Saratov Gubernia, to the Combined Returns for Samara Gubernia, and to Evaluation Returns for four uyezds of Voronezh Gubernia, and other Zemstvo statistical publications. 
 **We take this rare opportunity of expressing our agreement with Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
, who in his magazine articles of 1885 and subsequent years welcomed “the new type of Zemstvo statistical publications,”namely, the combined tables, which make it possible to classify household data not only according to allotment, but also according to economic strength. 
 “The statistical data,” wrote Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
 at thattime, “must be adapted to the groups themselves and not to such a conglomeration of the most diverse economic groups of peasants as the village or the village community. 
 ” (V. 
 V. 
, “A New Type of Local Statistical Publication,” pp. 
 189 and 190 in Severny Vestnik [Northern Herald ], 1885, No. 
 3. 
 Quoted in the “Introduction” to the Combined Returns for Saratov Gubernia, p. 
 36). 
 To our extreme regret in none of his later works has Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
 made any effort to glance at the data on the various groups of the peasantry, and, as we have seen, he has even ignored the factual part of the book by Mr. 
 V. 
 Post-nikov, who was probably the first to attempt the arrangement of the data according to the various groups of the peasantry and not according to “conglomerations of the most diverse groups”. 
 Whyis this? tov statisticians described above enable us to demonstrate clearly the uselessness of classification according to allot-ment. 
 Take, for example, the category of non-allotment peas-ants in Kamyshin Uyezd (see Combined Returns , p. 
 450 and foll. 
, the Returns for Kamyshin Uyezd, Vol. 
 XI, p. 
 174 and foll. 
). 
 The compiler of the Combined Returns , in describing this category, says that the area under crops is “very negli-gible” (“Introduction”, p. 
 45), i. 
e. 
, he assigns it to the cate-gory of the poor. 
 Let us take the tables. 
 The “average” areaunder crops in this category is 2. 
9 dess. 
 per household. 
 But see how this “average” was reached: by adding together the big crop growers (18 dess. 
 per household in the group with 5 andmore draught animals; the households in this group consti-tute about 8 of the whole category, but they possess about half of this category’s area under crops) and the poor,the horseless peasants, with 0. 
2 dess. 
 per household! Take the households employing farm labourers. 
 There are very few of them in this category—77 in all, or 2. 
5%. 
 But of these77 there are 60 in the top group, in which the area cultivated is 18 dess. 
 per household; and in this group the households employing farm labourers constitute 24. 
5%. 
 Clearly, weobscure the differentiation of the peasantry, depict the proper-tyless peasants in a better light than they actually are (by adding the rich to them and striking averages), while, on thecontrary, we depict the well-to-do peasants as being of lesser strength, because the category of peasants with large allot-ments includes, in addition to the majority, the well-off, alsothe badly-off (it is a known fact that even the large-allotment village communities always include indigent peasants). 
 We are now clear, too, as to the incorrectness of the second argu-ment in defence of classification according to allotment. 
 It is argued that by such classification the indices of economic strength (number of animals, area under crops, etc. 
) alwaysshow a regular increase according to the increase in the size of the allotment. 
 That is an undoubted fact, for the allot-ment is one of the major factors of well-being. 
 Where, con-sequently, the peasants are large-allotment holders there are always more members of the peasant bourgeoisie and, as a result, the “average” allotment figures for the whole categoryare raised. 
 All this, however, gives no grounds whatever for inferring that a method combining the rural bourgeoisie with the rural proletariat is correct. 
 We conclude: in systematising peasant household statistics one should not limit oneself to classification according to allotment. 
 Economic statistics must necessarily take the scale and type of farm as the basis of classification. 
 The indices for distinguishing these types should be taken in conformity with local conditions and forms of agriculture, while in deal-ing with extensive grain farming, one can limit oneself to clas-sifying according to area under crops (or to the number of draught animals); under other conditions one must take ac-count of the area under industrial crops, the technical proces-sing of agricultural produce, the cultivation of root crops or of fodder grasses, dairy farming, vegetable growing, etc. 
 When the peasantry combine agricultural and industrial occupationson a large scale, a combination of the two systems of classifi-cation is necessary, i. 
e. 
, of classification according to the scale and type of agriculture, and of classification according to thescale and type of “industries. 
” The methods of summarising peasant household returns are not such a narrowly specific and second-rate problem as one might imagine at first sight. 
On the contrary, it will be no exaggeration to say that at the present time it is the basic problem of Zemstvo statistics. 
 The completeness of household returns and the technique ofcollecting them * have reached a high degree of perfection, but owing to unsatisfactory summarising, a vast amount of most valuable information is simply lost, and the investigatorhas at his disposal merely “average” figures (for village communities, volosts, categories of peasants, size of allot-ment, etc. 
). 
 But these “averages,” as we have seen already,and shall see later, are often absolutely fictitious. 
 *About the technique of Zemstvo censuses see, in addition to the above-mentioned publications, the article by Mr. 
 Fortunatov in Vol. 
 I of Results of Zemstvo Statistical Investigation . 
 Specimens of household registration cards are reproduced in the “Introduction”to the Combined Returns for Samara Gubernia and to the Combined Returns for Saratov Gubernia , in the Statistical Returns for Orel Gubernia (Vol.

2 100 Hence, here too, notwithstanding the considerably smaller areas under crops, we find the same ratios between thegroups, the same concentration of crop areas and animals inthe hands of a small group of well-to-do peasants. 
 The ratiobetween the land held and the land in actual economicuse is the same as in the gubernias with which we are already familiar.

8 We see here a clear refutation of the view of the Saratov statisticians that the hiring of day labourers is not a character-istic index of a farm’s strength or weakness. 
 On the contra-ry, it is a supremely characteristic index of the peasant bour-geoisie. 
 In all forms of hiring by the day we observe that the percentage of peasants who hire labourers increases together with the increase in economic strength, despite the fact thatthe most affluent peasants are best provided with workers in their families. 
 Here, too, family co-operation is the basis of capitalist co-operation. 
 Further, we see that the number offarms hiring day labourers is 2 2 times (average for the uyezd) the number hiring seasonal workers—we take the hiring of day labourers for reaping; unfortunately, the statisticiansdid not give the total number of farms hiring day labourers, although this information was available. 
 In the three top groups, of 7,679 households 2,190 employ farm labourers,while 4,017 households, i. 
e. 
, the majority of the peasants in the well-to-do group, hire day labourers for reaping. 
 Of course, the hiring of day labourers is by no means specific to PermGubernia, and if we have seen above that in the well-to-doNo. 
 of workingmales per house-hold seasonal for mowingfor reapingfor threshing seasonal for mowing for reaping for threshing peasant groups from 2 to 6 and 9 tenths of the total number of proprietors employ farm labourers, the direct conclusion is the following. 
 The majority of the well-to-do peasant house-holds employ hired labour in one form or another. 
 The forma-tion of a body of regular farm labourers and day labourers is an essential condition for the existence of the well-to-do peasantry . 
 Lastly, it is extremely interesting to note that the ratio between the number of farms hiring day labourers and the number employing regular farm labourers diminishes from the bottom peasant groups to the top . 
 In the bottom groups the number of farms hiring day labourers always exceeds, many times over, the number employing regular farm labourers. 
In the top groups, on the contrary, the number of farms employing regular farm labourers is sometimes even larger than the number hiring day labourers. 
 This fact clearly pointsto the formation in the top groups of the peasantry of farms employing labourers, farms based on the regular employment of wage-labour; wage-labour is more evenly distributed overthe seasons of the year, and it becomes possible to dispense with the more costly and more troublesome hiring of day labourers. 
 Let us quote, incidentally, the returns on hiredlabour for Elabuga Uyezd, Vyatka Gubernia (the well-to-do peasants are here merged with the middle peasants).

1 Assuming that every day labourer works one month (28 days), the number of day labourers will be three times the number of seasonal workers.

7 176 Thus, here too, we see a profound difference in the systems and methods of farming employed by the poor and the affluent peasants. 
 And this difference must exist everywhere,since the well-to-do peasants everywhere concentrate intheir hands the greater part of the peasant-owned animals,and have more opportunities for expending-their labour onfarm improvements. 
 Therefore, if we learn, for example, that the post-Reform “peasantry” have at one and the same time created a group of horseless and cattleless households and“raised agricultural efficiency” by adopting the practice ofmanuring the soil (described in detail by Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
 in hisProgressive Trends in Peasant Farming , pp. 
 123-160 and foll. 
), this quite clearly shows us that the “progressive trends” simply indicate the progress of the rural bourgeoisie. 
 This is seen even more distinctly in the distribution of improvedagricultural implements, data regarding which are also avail-able in the Perm statistics. 
 These data, however, have beencollected not for the whole of the agricultural part of theuyezd, but only for its 3rd, 5th and 4th districts, comprising 15,076 households out of 23,574. 
 The following improved implements are registered: winnowers 1,049, seed-sorters 225,threshers 354, totalling 1,628.

8 1,628 100 One more illustration of Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
’s “Narodnik” thesis that improved implements are used by “all” peasants! The data on “industries” enable us this time to single out two main types of “industries,” indicating 1) the transforma-tion of the peasantry into a rural bourgeoisie (ownership ofcommercial and industrial establishment), and 2) the trans-formation of the peasantry into a rural proletariat (sale of labour-power, the so-called “agricultural industries”). 
 Thefollowing table shows the distribution by groups of thesediametrically opposite types of “industrialists” *: Distribution Commercial of commercial% of farms& industrial and industrialengaging inGroups of householders establish-establish-agriculturalmentsper 100 mentsindustriespeasants by groups as % of total Cultivating no land ....

2 A comparison of these data with those showing the dis-tribution of the area under crops and the hiring of workersonce again shows that the differentiation of the peasantrycreates a home market for capitalism. 
 *“Agricultural industries” are also singled out only for the last three districts. 
 The commercial and industrial establishments total692, namely 132 watermills, 16 oilmills, 97 pitch and tar works,283 “smithies, etc. 
” and 164 “shops, taverns, etc. 
” We see also how profoundly the facts are distorted when the most varied types of occupations are lumped together under the heading of “industries” or “employments,” when the “combination of agriculture with industries” is depicted (as,for example, by Messrs. 
 V. 
 V. 
 and N. 
 —on) as something uniform, identical in nature and precluding capitalism. 
 Let us point in conclusion to the similarity of the data for Ekaterinburg Uyezd. 
 If from the 59,709 households in the uyezd we subtract the landless (14,601 households), those hav-ing only meadow land (15,679 households), and those neg-lecting their allotments entirely (1,612 households), we getfor the remaining 27,817 households the following data:the 20,000 households that cultivate no land or cultivatelittle (up to 5 dess. 
) have an aggregate area under crops of 41,000 dess. 
 out of 124,000 dess. 
, i. 
e. 
, less than 3. 
 On the other hand, 2,859 well-to-do households (with over 10dess. 
 under crops) have 49,751 dess. 
 under crops, and 53,000dess. 
 of rented land out of a total of 67,000 dess. 
 (including47,000 dess. 
 out of 55,000 dess. 
 of rented peasant land). 
 Thedistribution of the two opposite types of “industries” and also of the households employing farm labourers in Ekaterinburg Uyezd is shown to be quite similar to the distribution ofthese indices of differentiation for Krasnoufimsk Uyezd. 
 V. 
 ZEMSTVO STATISTICS FOR OREL GUBERNIA We have at our disposal two volumes of statistics, for the Yelets and Trubchevsk uyezds of this gubernia, which clas-sify the peasant households according to the number of draught horses owned. 
 * Combining the two uyezds, we give the following joint data by groups. 
 *Statistical Returns for Orel Gubernia , Vol. 
 II, Moscow, 1887. 
 Yelets Uyezd, and Vol. 
 III, Orel, 1887. 
 Trubchevsk Uyezd. 
 Forthe latter uyezd the data do not include those for the suburban villagecommunities. 
 We take joint data for the renting of land, combiningthe allotment and non-allotment rented land. 
 We have determined the amount of leased land approximately, from the number of house-holds leasing out the whole of their allotments. 
 The figures obtainedconstitute the basis for determining the amount of land in use by each group (allotment #purchased land #rented land —land leased out).

2 100 From this we see that the general relations between the groups are the same as those we have seen earlier (the concen-tration of purchased and rented land in the hands of the well-to-do, the transfer of the land to them from the poor peas-ants, etc. 
). 
 Quite similar, too, are the relations between the groups as regards hired labour, “industries,” and “pro-gressive trends” in farming.

2 100 And so, in Orel Gubernia also we see the differentiation of the peasantry into two directly opposite types: on the onehand, into a rural proletariat (abandonment of land and saleof labour-power), and, on the other, into a peasant bour-geoisie (purchase of land, renting on a considerable scale,% of families % of population,both sexesAllotment land perhousehold (dess. 
) allotment purchased % of land rent-ing households rented leased out as % per household Animals (in termsof cattle) perhousehold % of total animals % of farmswith hiredworkers % of house-holds engagingin industries commercial& industrialestablishmentsper 100 farms Implementsper 100 farms % of totalimplements especially of allotment land, improved methods of farming, hiring of regular farm labourers and day labourers, here omitted, and the combining of commercial and industrial enterprises with agriculture. 
 The scale of farming by thepeasants here, however, is generally much smaller than inthe above-quoted cases; there are far fewer big crop growers,and the differentiation of the peasantry, to judge by these twouyezds, therefore seems weaker. 
 We say “seems” on the fol-lowing grounds: firstly, though we observe here that the “peas-antry” turn more rapidly into a rural proletariat and pro-duce hardly perceptible groups of rural bourgeois, we have,on the other hand, already seen examples of the reverse,where this latter pole of the countryside becomes particularlyperceptible. 
 Secondly, here the differentiation of the agri-cultural peasantry (we confine ourselves in this chapter to the agricultural peasantry) is obscured by the “industries,”the development of which is particularly extensive (40%of the families). 
 And the “industrialists” here too include,besides a majority of wage-workers, a minority of merchants,buyers-up, entrepreneurs, proprietors, etc. 
 Thirdly, here the differentiation of the peasantry is obscured because of the absence of data regarding the aspects of local agriculture thatare most closely connected with the market. 
 Commercial,market cultivation is not developed here to expand the cropareas to produce grain for sale but for the production of hemp. 
The largest number of commercial operations are bound up with this crop but the data of the tables given in the volume do not single out this particular aspect of agriculture among the various groups. 
 “Hemp growing is the main source of the peasants’ income” (that is, money income. 
 Returns for Trub-chevsk Uyezd , p. 
 5 of descriptions of villages, and many others), “the peasants devote their attention mainly to the cul-tivation of hemp. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 All the manure . 
 . 
 . 
 is used on the hempfields” (ibid. 
, 87), everywhere loans are contracted “on secu-rity of hemp,” and debts are paid with hemp (ibid. 
, passim). 
For the manuring of their hemp fields the well-to-do peasantsbuy manure from the poor ( Returns for Orel Uyezd , Vol. 
 VIII, Orel, 1895, pp. 
 91-105), hemp fields are leased out andrented in home and outside village communities (ibid. 
,260), and the processing of the hemp is done by part of the“industrial establishments” of whose concentration we have spoken. 
 It is clear how incomplete is that picture of differen-tiation which gives no information about the main commer-cial product of local agriculture. 
 * VI. 
 ZEMSTVO STATISTICS FOR VORONEZH GUBERNIA The returns for Voronezh Gubernia are distinguished for their exceptionally complete information and abundance of classifications. 
 In addition to the usual classification accord-ing to allotment, we have for several uyezds a classificationaccording to draught animals, to persons working (work-ing strength of family), to industries (not engaged in indus-tries; engaged in industries: a—agricultural, b—mixed andc—commercial and industrial), to farm labourers (farms with members employed as farm labourers;—with no farm labour-ers and with no members employed as such;—householdsemploying farm labourers). 
 The last classification is givenfor the largest number of uyezds, and at first glance one mightthink that it is the most suitable for studying the differentia-tion of the peasantry. 
 Actually, however, this is not the case: the group of farms providing farm labourers does not by any means embrace the whole of the rural proletariat, for itdoes not include farms providing day labourers, unskilledlabourers, factory workers, builders’ labourers, navvies,domestic servants, etc. 
 Farm labourers constitute only a partof the wage-workers provided by the “peasantry. 
” The group of farms that employ farm labourers is also very incomplete, for it does not include farms that hire day labourers. 
 The neu-tral group (which neither provides nor employs farm labour-ers) lumps together in each uyezd tens of thousands of *The compiler of the returns for Orel Uyezd states (Table No. 
 57) that the well-to-do peasants obtain nearly twice as much manure per head of cattle as do the poor (391 poods per head where there are7. 
4 animals per household, as against 208 poods per head where thereare 2. 
8 animals per household. 
 And this conclusion was reached byclassifying according to allotment, which obscures the real depth of differentiation). 
 This is due to the fact that the poor are compelled to use straw and dung as fuel, to sell it, etc. 
 Consequently, only thepeasant bourgeoisie secure the “normal” quantity of manure (400poods) per head of cattle. 
 In this connection, too, Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
 mightargue (as he does about the decline in horse possession) about “therestoration of the normal proportion” between the number of animals and the quantity of manure. 
 families, combining thousands of peasants who own no horses with thousands who own many, peasants who rent land and peasants who lease land, cultivators and non-cultivators, thousands of wage-workers and a minority of employers, etc. 
General “averages” for the entire neutral group are obtained,for example, by adding together landless households or thosepossessing 3 to 4 dess. 
 per household (of allotment and pur-chased land in all) and households possessing 25, 50 and more dessiatines of allotment land and purchasing additionally tens and hundreds of dessiatines of land (Returns for BobrovUyezd, p. 
 336, Col. 
 No. 
 148; for Novokhopersk Uyezd, p. 
 222)—by adding together households with 0. 
8 to 2. 
7 ani-mals per family and those with 12 to 21 animals (ibid. 
). 
 Nat-urally, one cannot depict the differentiation of the peasantry with the aid of such “averages,” and so we have to take the classification according to draught animals as the one most closely approximating classification according to scale of farming. 
 We have at our disposal four volumes of returns with this classification (for Zemlyansk, Zadonsk, Nizhnede-vitsk and Korotoyak uyezds), and from these we must choose Zadonsk Uyezd, because no separate returns are given for the others on the purchase and leasing of land according to groups. 
 Below we shall give combined data for all these four uyezds and the reader will see that the conclusions they yield are the same. 
 Here are general data for the groups in Zadonsk Uyezd (15,704 households, 106,288 persons of both sexes,135,656 dess. 
 of allotment land, 2,882 dess. 
 of purchased land,24,046 dess. 
 of rented, and 6,482 dess.

 The extremelynegligible scale of peasant farming even raises the question,nd naturally so, of whether the local peasants do not belong to the “industrialists” rather than to the tillers of the soil.

0 The distribution of improved implements and of the two opposite types of “industries” (the sale of labour-power andcommercial and industrial enterprise) is the same as in the data examined above. 
 The enormous percentage of households engaging in “industries,” the preponderance of grain-purchas-ing over grain-selling farms, the preponderance of moneyincome from “industries” over money income from agricul-ture *—all this gives us grounds for regarding this uyezd as “industrial” rather than agricultural. 
 Let us, however, *In the numerically small top group of the peasantry we see the opposite: the preponderance of grain sales over purchase, thereceipt of money income mainly from the land, and a high percentage of peasants employing farm labourers, possessing improved imple-ments, and owning commercial and industrial establishments. 
 All the typical features of the peasant bourgeoisie are clearly visible heretoo (despite its small numbers); they are visible in the shape of thegrowth of commercial and capitalist agriculture. 
per 100 farms % of total hiring farmlabourers providing farmlabourers Commercial& industrialestablishmentsper 100 farms engaging inindustries selling grain buying grain industries sale of agricul-tural produce see what sort of industries these are. 
 The Evaluation Returns on Peasant Landownership in Zemlyansk , Zadonsk , Korotoyak and Nizhnedevitsk Uyezds (Voronezh, 1889) contains a list of all the trades of the “industrialists,” working locallyand away from home (222 trades in all), classified in groupsaccording to allotment, and indicating the size of earnings ineach trade. 
 This list shows that the overwhelming majority of the peasant “industries ” consist of work for hire . 
 Of 24,134 “industrialists” in Zadonsk Uyezd, 14,135 are farm labourers, carters, shepherds and unskilled labourers, 1,813 are builders’labourers, 298 are town, factory and other workers, 446 areengaged in private service, 301 are beggars, etc. 
 In otherwords, the overwhelming majority of the “industrialists” aremembers of the rural proletariat, allotment-holding wage-workers , who sell their labour-power to rural and industrial employers. 
 * Thus, if we take the ratio between the different groups of the peasantry in a given gubernia or a given uyezd,we find everywhere the typical features of differentiation, both in the land-abundant steppe gubernias with their relativelyhuge peasant crop areas, and in the most land-poor localities with their miniature peasant “farms”; despite the most pro-*To supplement what has been said above about the term “in-dustries” as used in Zemstvo statistics, let us quote more detailed data on peasant industries in this locality. 
 The Zemstvo statisticianshave divided them into six categories: 1) Agricultural industries (59,277 persons out of a total of 92,889 “industrialists” in the 4 uyezds). 
 The overwhelming majority are wage-workers, but among them wealso find proprietors (melon growers, vegetable growers, bee-keepers, perhaps some coachmen, etc. 
). 
 2) Artisans and handicraftsmen (20,784 persons) Among the genuine artisans ( =those who work on orders for customers ) are included very many wage-workers, particularly building workers, etc. 
 Of the latter we have counted over 8,000 (the figure probably includes some proprietors: bakers, etc. 
). 
 3) Servants—1,737 persons. 
 4) Merchants and master-industrialists—7,104 persons. 
 As we have said, it is particularly necessary to single out this category from the general mass of “industrialists. 
” 5) Liberal professions—2,881 persons, including 1,090 beggars; in addition to these there are tramps, gendarmes, prostitutes, policemen, etc. 
 6) Town, factory and other workers—1,106 persons, local industrialists—71,112,migratory industrialists—21,777, males—85,255, females—7,634. 
 The earnings are the most varied: for example, in Zadonsk Uyezd 8,580 unskilled labourers earn 234,677 rubles, while 647 merchants andmaster-industrialists earn 71,799 rubles. 
 One can imagine the con-fusion that results when all these most diverse “industries” are lumped together—but that is what is usually done by our Zemstvo found difference in agrarian and agricultural conditions, the ratio between the top group of the peasantry and the bottom is everywhere the same. 
 If, however, we compare the different localities, in some we see with particular clarity the forma-tion of rural entrepreneurs from among the peasants and inothers we see the formation of a rural proletariat. 
 It goeswithout saying that in Russia, as in every other capitalistcountry, the latter aspect of the process of differentiation embraces an incomparably larger number of small cultivators (and very likely a larger number of localities) than the former.

 ZEMSTVO STATISTICS FOR NIZHNI-NOVGOROD GUBERNIA For three uyezds of Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia—the Knyaginin, Makaryev and Vasil uyezds—the Zemstvo house-to-house census returns have been reduced to one table, whichdivides the peasant farms (only allotment-holding and onlyof peasants living in their own villages) into five groupsaccording to draught animals held ( Material for the Evaluation of the Lands of Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia. 
 Economic Section . 
 Vols. 
 IV, IX and XII, Nizhni-Novgorod, 1888, 1889, 1890). 
 Combining these three uyezds, we get the following data on the groups of households (in the three uyezds mentioned the data cover 52,260 households and 294,798 persons of both sexes. 
 Allotment land—433,593 dess. 
, purchased—51,960 dess.

6% of the total, have 46. 
2% of the purchasedland, whereas the poor peasants, q of the households, have less than a quarter), as well as concentrate the rented land, and “gather” the allotment land leased by the poor. 
 As a result of all this the actual distribution of the land in use by the “peasantry” is quite unlike the distri-bution of the allotment land. 
 The horseless peasants haveactually less land at their disposal than the allotment guaran-teed them by law. 
 The one-horse and two-horse peasants increase their holdings by only 10 to 30% (from 8. 
1 dess.

4 dess. 
, and from 10. 
5 dess. 
 to 13. 
8 dess. 
), whereas the well-to-do peasants increase their holdings one and a half times to double . 
 While the differences in the allotment land of the groups are negligible, the differences in the actual scale of cultivation are enormous, as can be seen from the above-quoted data on animals and from the following data on area under crops: Groups of householders Horseless 1.

Area under cropsper household(dess. 
) % of total areaunder crops % of householdsemploying la-bourers % of peasantswith commercial& industrial es-tablishments* % of hhldswith outsideemployments When assessed by the area under crops the differences be-tween the groups are seen to be even greater than when assessed by the amount of land actually held and in use, to say noth-ing of the differences in the size of the allotments. 
 * This shows again and again the utter uselessness of classificationby allotment holding, the “equality” of which has now becomea legal fiction. 
 The other columns of the table show how the“combination of agriculture with industry” is taking place among the peasantry: the well-to-do peasants combine com-mercial and capitalist agriculture (the high percentage ofhouseholds employing farm labourers) with commercial andindustrial undertakings, whereas the poor combine the saleof their labour-power (“outside employments”) with cropgrowing on an insignificant scale, that is, are converted into allotment-holding farm labourers and day labourers. 
 Let us observe that the absence of a proportionate diminu-tion in the percentage of the households with outside employ-ments is explained by the extreme variety of these “employ-ments” and “industries” of the Nizhni-Novgorod peasantry:besides agricultural workers, unskilled labourers, building and shipbuilding workers, etc. 
, the industrialists here in-clude a relatively very large number of “handicraftsmen,”owners of industrial workshops, merchants, buyers-up, etc. 
Obviously, the lumping together of “industrialists” of suchdiverse types distorts the data on “households with outsideearnings. 
 ” ** On the question of the differences in cultivation by the vari-ous groups of peasants, let us observe that in the Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia, “manuring the land . 
 . 
 . 
 is one of the chiefconditions determining the degree of productivity” of theploughlands (p. 
 79 of the Returns for Knyaginin Uyezd). 
 The *If we take the size of the allotment of the horseless peasants (per household) as 100, the allotments of the higher groups will be expressed by the figures: 159, 206, 259, 321. 
 The corresponding figuresfor land actually held by each group will be as follows: 100, 214,314, 477, 786; and for area under crops the figures for the groups willbe: 100, 231, 378, 568, 873. 
 **On the “industries” of the Nizhni-Novgorod peasantry, see Mr. 
 Plotnikov’s Handicraft Industries of Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia (Nizhni-Novgorod, 1894), tables at the end of the book, also Zemstvostatistical returns, particularly for the Gorbatov and Semyonovuyezds. 
 average rye yield grows in proportion to the increase in the amount of manure used: with 300 to 500 cart-loads of manure per 100 dess. 
 of allotment land, the rye crop amounts to 47. 
1 meras * per dess. 
; with 1,500 cart-loads and more, to 62. 
7 meras (ibid. 
, p. 
 84). 
 Clearly, therefore, the difference be-tween the groups in the scale of their agricultural productionshould be still greater than the difference in area under crops,and the Nizhni-Novgorod statisticians made a big mistake in studying the produce of the peasant fields in general, and not of the fields of the poor and the well-to-do peasantryseparately. 
 VIII. 
 REVIEW OF ZEMSTVO STATISTICS FOR OTHER GUBERNIAS As the reader will have observed, in studying the process of the differentiation of the peasantry we use exclusivelyZemstvo house-to-house census statistics, if they cover moreor less extensive areas, if they give sufficiently detailed infor-mation on the most important indices of differentiation, and if (which is particularly important) they have been processed in such a way as to make it possible to single out the variousgroups of peasants according to their economic strength. 
The data given above, relating to seven gubernias, exhaustthe Zemstvo statistical material that answers these condi-tions and that we have been able to use. 
 For the sake of com-pleteness, let us now point briefly to the remaining, less complete, data of a similar kind (i. 
e. 
, based on house-to-housecensuses). 
 For Demyansk Uyezd of Novgorod Gubernia we have a table on peasant farms grouped according to the number of horses(Material for Evaluating the Farmlands of Novgorod Guber-nia, Demyansk Uyezd , Novgorod, 1888). 
 There is no informa-tion here on land renting and leasing (in dessiatines), but thedata given reveal the complete similarity of the relationsbetween the well-to-do and the indigent peasants in this guber-nia, as compared with the other gubernias. 
 Here too, for exam-ple, as we proceed from the bottom group to the top (from the horseless households to those with 3 and more horses), there is an increase in the percentage of farms with purchased and *1 mera =204 pounds— Ed. 
 rented land, despite the fact that those with many horses have an amount of allotment land above the average. 
 Households with 3 or more horses, 10. 
7% of the total number of house-holds and 16. 
1 % of the population, possess 18. 
3% of all allot-ment land, 43. 
4% of the purchased land, 26. 
2% of the rentedland (to judge from the area under rye and oats on rented land),and 29. 
4% of the total “industrial buildings. 
” On the otherhand 51. 
3 %, the horseless and one-horse households, constitut-ing 40. 
1% of the population, have only 33. 
2% of the allot-ment land, 13. 
8% of the purchased land, 20. 
8% of the rentedland (in the sense indicated above), and 28. 
8% of the “industri-al buildings. 
” In other words, here too the well-to-do peasants“gather” the land and combine commercial and industrial“trades” with agriculture, while the poor abandon the land and turn into wage-workers (the percentage of “persons engaged in industries” diminishes as we pass from the bottomgroup to the top—from 26. 
6 % among the horseless peasants to7. 
8% among those having 3 and more horses). 
 The incom-pleteness of these data compels us to omit them from thefollowing summary of the material on the differentiation of the peasantry. 
 For the same reason we omit the data on part of Kozelets Uyezd, Chernigov Gubernia ( Material for Evaluating Farm-lands, Compiled by the Chernigov Statistical Department of the Gubernia Zemstvo Board , Vol. 
 V, Chernigov, 1882; the data on the number of draught animals are classi-fied for 8,717 households of the black-earth district of the uyezd). 
 The relationships between the groups are the same heretoo: 36. 
8% of the households, with no draught animals andconstituting 28. 
8% of the population, have 21% of their ownand allotment land and 7% of the rented land, but accountfor 63% of the total land let out on lease by these 8,717 house-holds. 
 On the other hand, 14. 
3% of the households, with 4 and more draught animals and constituting 17. 
3 % of the pop-ulation, have 33. 
4% of their own and allotment land and32. 
1% of the rented land, and account for only 7% of theland let out on lease. 
 Unfortunately, the other households(owning 1 to 3 draught animals) are not subdivided into smaller groups. 
 In Material for an Investigation of the Land-Usage and Domestic Life of the Rural Population of Irkutsk and Yenisei Gubernias there is a very interesting table (classification according to number of draught horses) of peasant and settler farms in four regions of Yenisei Gubernia (Vol. 
 III, Irkutsk, 1893, p. 
 730 and foll. 
). 
 It is very interesting to observethat the relationship between the well-to-do Siberian and thesettler (and in this relationship the most ardent Narodnikwould hardly dare to seek the famous community principle!)is essentially the same as that between our well-to-do village community members and their horseless and one-horse “breth-ren. 
” By combining the settlers and the peasant old-timers(such a combination is necessary because the former serve aslabour-power for the latter), we get the familiar features of thetop and bottom groups. 
 Of the households, 39. 
4%, the bot-tom groups (those with no horses, and with 1 or 2), consti-tuting 24% of the population, have only 6. 
2% of the total arable and 7. 
1% of the total animals, whereas 36. 
4% of thehouseholds, those with 5 and more horses, constituting 51. 
2%of the population, have 73% of the arable and 74. 
5% of thetotal cattle. 
 The latter groups (5 to 9, 10 and more horses),cultivating 15 to 36 dess. 
 per household, resort extensively to wage-labour (30 to 70% of the farms employ wage-workers), whereas the bottom three groups, cultivating 0—0. 
2—3—5dess. 
 per household provide workers (20—35—59% of the farms). 
 The data on the renting and leasing out of land arethe only exception we have met to the rule (of the concentra-tion of rented land in the hands of the well-to-do), and this is the sort of exception that proves the rule. 
 The point is that in Siberia there are none of the conditions that created this rule, there is no compulsory and “equalitarian” allotmentof land, there is no established private property in land. 
The well-to-do peasant neither purchases nor rents land, but appropriates it (at least that has been the case till now); the leasing out and the renting of land are rather of the charac-ter of neighbourly exchange, and that is why the group data on the renting and the leasing of land display no consistency. 
 * *“The locally collected material giving facts on the leasing and renting of farmland was considered to be unworthy of especial treat-ment, because the phenomenon exists only in a rudimentary form;isolated cases of leasing out and renting occur now and again, but areof an utterly fortuitous character and exercise no influence yet on theeconomic life of Yenisei Gubernia” ( Material , Vol. 
 IV, Part 1, p. 
 V, For three uyezds of Poltava Gubernia we can determine approximately the way the area under crops is distributed (knowing the number of farms with different areas under crops —indicated in the statistical reports as “from—to” so manydessiatines—and multiplying the number of householdsin each division by the average area under crops withinthe limits indicated). 
 We get the following data for76,032 households (villagers, excluding non-peasants) with 362,298 dess. 
 under crops: 31,001 households (40. 
8%) cultivate no land or only up to 3 dess. 
 per household, to atotal of 36,040 dess. 
 under crops (9. 
9%); 19,017 households(25%) cultivate over 6 dess. 
 per household and have 209,195dess. 
 under crops (57. 
8%). 
 (See Economic Statistical Returns for Poltava Gubernia , Konstantinograd, Khorol and Piryatin uyezds. 
)50 The distribution of area under crops is very much the same as what we have seen in the case of TauridaGubernia, despite the basically smaller areas under crops. 
 Naturally, such an uneven distribution is possible only wherethe purchased and rented land is concentrated in the handsof a minority. 
 We have no complete data on this, since the statistics do not classify households according to economic strength and must therefore confine ourselves to the followingdata on Konstantinograd Uyezd. 
 In the chapter of farmingby the rural social-estates (Chapter II, §5, “Agriculture”) thecompiler of the abstract states: “In general, if rented plots aredivided into three categories: area per lessee of 1) up to 10 dess. 
, 2) from 10 to 30 dess. 
 and 3) over 30 dess.

 Clearly, these figures also point to the concentration of purchased and rented land in the hands ofthe well-to-do peasantry. 
 For Tver Gubernia, despite the wealth of information in the statistical returns the house-to-house censuses havebeen very inadequately processed; there is no classification of households according to economic strength. 
 This defect is used by Mr. 
 Vikhlyayev in the Statistical Returns for Tver Gubernia (Vol. 
 XIII, Part 2, Peasant Farming , Tver, 1897) to deny “differentiation” among the peasantry, to detect adrive towards “greater equality,” and to sing hymns in praiseof “people’s production” (p. 
 312) and “natural economy. 
” Mr. 
 Vikhlyayev enters into the most hazardous and unfounded *Statistical Survey of Kaluga Gubernia for 1896 , Kaluga, 1897,non-sow-ing up to15 15 to30 30 to45 45 to60 over60 Total % of house-holds ....

 . 
 { arguments on stratification,” not only without citing any precise data on the peasant groups, but without even having made clear for himself the elementary truth that differ-entiation is taking place within the village community, andthat therefore to talk about “stratification” and to classifyexclusively according to village communities or to volostsis simply ridiculous. 
 * IX. 
 SUMMARY OF THE ABOVE ZEMSTVO STATISTICS ON THE DIFFERENTIATION OF THE PEASANTRY In order to compare and combine the above-quoted data on the differentiation of the peasantry, we obviously cannottake absolute figures and put them into groups: for that we should require complete data for the whole group of dis-tricts and identical methods of classification. 
 We can onlycompare and juxtapose the relation of the top to the bot-tom groups (as regards possession of land, animals, imple-ments, etc. 
). 
 The relationship expressed, for example, inthe fact that 10% of the households have 30% of the area un-der crops, does away with the difference in the absolute figures and is therefore suitable for comparison with every similarrelationship in any locality. 
 But to make such a comparisonwe must single out in the other locality 10% of the house-holds, too, neither more nor less. 
 But the sizes of the groupsin the different uyezds and gubernias are not equal. 
 And *As a curiosity, let us quote one sample, Mr. 
 Vikhlyayev’s “general conclusion” reads: “The purchase of land by the peasants ofTver Gubernia tends to equalise the size of holdings” (p. 
 11). 
 Proof?—If we take the groups of village communities according to size of allotment, we shall find that the small-allotment communities have a larger percentage of households with purchased land. 
 Mr. 
 Vikhlyayevdoes not even suspect that it is the well-to-do members of the small-allotment communities who buy land! Of course, there is no need toexamine such “conclusions” of an out-and-out Narodnik, the more sothat Mr. 
 Vikhlyayev’s boldness has embarrassed even the economists in his own camp. 
 Mr. 
 Karyshev, in Russkoye Bogatstvo [Russian Wealth ] (1898, No. 
 8), although expressing his profound sympathy with the way Mr. 
 Vikhlyayev “orientates himself well among theproblems with which the economy of the country is faced at thepresent time,” is yet compelled to admit that Mr. 
 Vikhlyayev is toogreat an “optimist,” that his conclusions about the drive towards equality are “not very convincing,” that his data “tell us nothing,” so, we have to split up these groups so as to take in each local-ity an equal percentage of households . 
 Let us agree to take 20% of the households for the well-to-do peasants and 50% for the poor, i. 
e. 
, let us form out of the top groups one of 20%of the households, and out of the bottom groups one of50%. 
 Let us illustrate this method by an example. 
 Sup-pose we have five groups of the following proportions, fromthe bottom to the top: 30%, 25%, 20%, 15% and 10% of the households (S =100%). 
 To form a bottom group, we take the first group and t of the second group (30 # = 50%), and to form a top group we take the last group and q of the penultimate group (10 # =20%), the per-centages for area under crops, animals, implements, etc. 
, being determined, of course, in the same way. 
 That is to say, if the percentages for area under crops corresponding to the above-stated percentages of the households are as fol-lows: 15%, 20%, 20%, 21% and 24% (S=100%), then our top group, 20% of the households, will account for (24 # =38%) of the area under crops, while our bottom group, 50% of the households, will account for (15 # = 31%) of the area under crops. 
 Obviously, in splitting up the groups in this manner, we do not change by one iota the actual relationship between the bottom and top strata of the peasantry. 
 * This splitting up is necessary, firstly, because in this way, instead of 4—5—6—7 different groups, we getthree large groups with clearly defined indices **; secondly, because only in this way are data on the differentiation of the peasantry in the most varied localities under the mostvaried conditions comparable. 
 *This method involves a slight error, as a consequence of which the differentiation appears to be less than it really is. 
 Namely: to the top group are added average, and not the top members of the next group; to the bottom group are added average, and not the bottom members of the next group. 
 Clearly the error becomes greater as thegroups become larger and the number of groups smaller. 
 **In the next section we shall see that the proportions of the groups we have taken come very close to those of the groups of theRussian peasantry as a whole, divided according to the number of2594 5 1592 3 2192 32594 5 Pages 276-277 of the Statistical Review of Poltava Gubernia (Vol. 
 XIV, 1894) with V. 
 I. 
 Lenin’s notes To judge the interrelation between the groups we take the following data, the most important on the question of differ-entiation: 1) number of households; 2) number of persons of both sexes of the peasant population; 3) amount of allotmentland; 4) purchased land; 5) rented land; 6) land leased out; 7) total land owned or in use by the group (allotment # purchased # rented — land leased out); 8) area under crops; 9) number of draught animals; 10) total number of animals; 11) number of households employing farm labourers; 12) number of households with employments (singling out as far as possible those forms of “employment” among which workfor hire, sale of labour-power predominates); 13) commercialand industrial establishments and 14) improved agricul-tural implements. 
 The items given in italics (“leasing of land” and “employments”) are of negative significance, since they indicate the decline of the farm, the ruin of the peasantand his conversion into a worker. 
 All the other data are ofpositive significance, since they indicate the expansion of the farm and the conversion of the peasant into a rural entrepre-neur. 
 On all these points we compute for each group of farms the percentages of the total for the uyezd or for severaluyezds of one gubernia, and then ascertain (by the methodwe have described) what percentage of the land, area undercrops, animals, etc. 
, falls to the 20% of the households of thetop groups and to the 50% of the households of the bottom groups. 
 * We give a table drawn up in this manner covering the data for 21 uyezds in 7 gubernias, with a total of 558,570peasant farms and a population of 3,523,418 persons of bothsexes. 
 *We beg the reader not to forget that now we are dealing not with absolute figures, but with relationships between the top andthe bottom strata of the peasantry. 
 Therefore, for example, we nowtake the number of households employing farm labourers (or with“employments”) as percentages, not of the number of households in the given group, but of the total number of households employing farm labourers (or with “employments”) in the uyezd. 
 In other words,what we now ascertain is not the extent to which each group employswage-labour (or resorts to the sale of labour-power) but merely therelationships between the top and bottom groups as to the employ-ment of wage-labour (or to participation in “employments,” in the Table A .

 For Taurida Gubernia the returns for land leased out concern only two uyezds: Berdyansk and Dnieper. 
 2. 
 For the same gubernia the category of improved implements includes mowers and reapers. 
 3. 
 For the two uyezds of Samara Gubernia instead of the per-centage of land leased out the percentage of allotment-leasing non-farming households has been taken. 
 4. 
 For Orel Gubernia the amount of land leased out (and conse-quently of the total land in use) has been determined approximately. 
The same applies to the four uyezds of Voronezh Gubernia. 
 5. 
 For Orel Gubernia the returns for improved implements exist for only Yelets Uyezd. 
 6. 
 For Voronezh Gubernia, instead of the number of households with employments we have taken (for three uyezds: Zadonsk, Koro-toyak and Nizhnedevitsk) the number of households providing farmlabourers. 
 7. 
 For Voronezh Gubernia returns for improved implements exist for only two uyezds: Zemlyansk and Zadonsk. 
 8. 
 For Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia, instead of households engaged in “industries” in general, we have taken the households engaging in outside employments. 
 9. 
 For some of the uyezds, instead of the number of commercial and industrial establishments, we have had to take the number of households with commercial and industrial establishments. 
 10. 
 Where the statistical returns give several columns of “employ-ments” we have tried to single out those “employments” which most exactly indicate work for hire, the sale of labour-power. 
 11. 
 All rented land, as far as possible, has been taken—allotment and non-allotment, arable and meadow land. 
 12. 
 We would remind the reader that for Novouzensk Uyezd farm-stead peasants and Germans are excluded, for Krasnoufimsk Uyezd only the agricultural part of the uyezd has been taken for Ekaterin-burg Uyezd landless peasants and those possessing a share in meadowland alone are excluded, for Trubchevsk Uyezd suburban village communities are excluded, for Knyaginin Uyezd the industrial village of Bolshoye Murashkino is excluded, etc. 
 These exclusions are partlyours, and are partly due to the nature of the material. 
 Obviously, therefore, the differentiation of the peasantry must actually be more pronounced than appears in our table and chart. 
 To illustrate this combined table and to show clearly the complete similarity, of the relationship of the top to thebottom peasant groups in the most varied localities, we have drawn the following chart on which are plotted the percentages in the table. 
 To the right of the column indicat-ing the percentages of total households, runs a curve show-ing the positive indices of economic strength (enlargement of holding, increase in the number of animals, etc. 
), while to the left runs a curve showing the negative indices of economic strength (leasing out of land, sale of labour-power; these col-umns are shaded). 
 The distance from the top horizontal line of the chart to each continuous curve shows the share of the well-to-do groups in the sum-total of peasant farming, while the distance from the bottom horizontal line to each broken curve shows the share of the poor groups in that sum-total. 
 Lastly, to give a clear picture of the general charac-ter of the combined data, we have plotted an “average”curve (arrived at by calculating arithmetical averages fromthe percentages indicated in the chart. 
 To distinguish itfrom the others, this “average” curve is in red). 
 This “average”curve indicates, so to speak, the typical differentiation of the Russian peasantry today. 
 Now, in order to sum up the data on differentiation given above (§§I-VII), let us examine this chart column by column. 
 The first column to the right of the one indicating the percentages of households shows the proportion of the popu-lation belonging to the top and the bottom groups. 
 We see that everywhere the size of the families of the well-to-do peas-antry is above the average and that of the poor below theaverage. 
 We have already spoken of the significance of thisfact. 
 Let us add that it would be wrong to take as the unitfor all comparisons the individual (as the Narodniks are fondof doing) and not the household, the family. 
 While the expend-iture of the well-to-do family grows because of the larger size of the family, the mass of expenditure, on the other hand,in the large-family household diminishes (on buildings,domestic effects, household needs, etc. 
, etc. 
 The economic ad-vantages of large families are particularly stressed by Engel-hardt in his Letters From the Countryside , 51 and by Trirogov in his book, The Village Community and the Poll Tax , St. 
 Petersburg, 1882). 
 Therefore, to take the individual as theunit for comparisons, and to take no account of this diminu-tion, means artificially and falsely to identify the conditionof the “individual” in the large and in the small families. 
 Inci-dentally, the chart clearly shows that the well-to-do group of peasants concentrate in their hands a far larger share of agri-cultural production than would follow from a calculationper head of population. 
 The next column refers to allotment land. 
 In its distri-bution we see the greatest degree of equality, as should be the case by virtue of the legal status of allotment land. 
 But even here the process of the poor being ousted by thewell-to-do peasants is beginning: everywhere we find that the top groups hold a somewhat larger share of the allotmentland than the share they represent in the population, whilethe bottom groups hold a somewhat smaller one. 
 The “village community” tends to serve the interests of the peasant bour-geoisie. 
 Compared, however, with the actual land tenure the inequality in the distribution of allotment land is stillquite insignificant. 
 The distribution of allotment land doesnot (as is clearly evident from the chart) give any idea ofthe actual distribution of land and farm property. 
 * Then comes the column for purchased land. 
 In all cases this land is concentrated in the hands of the well-to-do: one-fifth of the households have about 6 or 7 tenths of all peasant-owned purchased land, whereas the poor peasants, constitut-ing half the households, account for a maximum of 15%!One can judge, therefore, the significance of the “Narodnik” fuss about enabling the “peasantry” to buy as much land as possible and as cheaply as possible. 
 The next column is that for rented land. 
 Here too we see everywhere the concentration of the land in the handsof the well-to-do (one-fifth of the households account for5 to 8 tenths of the total rented land) who, moreover, rent land at cheaper rates, as we have seen above. 
 This grabbing of rentable land by the peasant bourgeoisie clearly demon-strates that “peasant renting” carries an industrial character (the purchase of land for the purpose of selling the prod-uct. 
) ** In saying this, however, we do not at all deny *A single glance at the chart is sufficient to see how useless is classification according to allotment for a study of the differentiation of the peasantry. 
 **Very curious in Mr. 
 Karyshev’s book on the subject of rentings is the Conclusion (Chapter VI). 
 After all his assertions about the absence of an industrial character in peasant renting, assertions devoidof foundation and contradicting Zemstvo statistics, Mr. 
 Karyshevadvances a “theory of rent” (borrowed from W. 
 Roscher, etc. 
), in ‘efficient’ use of the land by . 
 . 
 . 
 the peasan t,” p. 
 371 ) and moderateother words, serves up with a scientific sauce the desiderata of West-European capitalist farmers: “long leases” (“w hat is needed is . 
 . 
 . 
 the fact of land renting being due to want. 
 On the contrary, the chart shows the entirely different character of renting by the poor, who cling to the land (half the households account for 1 to 2 tenths of the total rented land). 
 There arepeasants and peasants. 
 The contradictory significance of land renting in “peas-ant farming” stands out particularly vividly when wecompare the column on land renting with that on the leas-ing out of land (first column to the left, i. 
e. 
, among the negative indices). 
 Here we see the very opposite: the prin-cipal lessors of land are the bottom groups (half the house-holds account for 7 to 8 tenths of the land leased), whostrive to get rid of their allotments, which pass (despitelegal prohibitions and restrictions) into the hands of em-ployer farmers. 
 Thus, when we are told that the “peas-antry” rent land and that the “peasantry” lease out theirland, we know that the first applies mainly to the peasantbourgeoisie and the second to the peasant proletariat. 
 The relation of purchased, rented and leased land to the allotment determines also the actual land held by the groups (5th column to the right). 
 In all cases we see that the actual distribution of the total land at the disposal of the peasantshas nothing in common with the “equality” of the allot-ments. 
 Of the households 20% account for 35% to 50%of the total land, while 50% account for 20% to 30%. 
 Inthe distribution of area under crops (next column) the ousting of the bottom group by the top stands out in still greater relief, probably because the poor peasantry are rents that leave the tenant enough to cover wages, interest and the repayment of invested capital, and employer’s profit (373). 
 And Mr. 
Karyshev is not in the least disturbed by the fact that this sort oftheory” appears side by side with the usual Narodnik recipe: “avert”(398). 
 In order to “avert” capitalist farming Mr. 
 Karyshev advancesthe “theory” of capitalist farming! This sort of “conclusion” naturally crowned the basic contradiction in the book by Mr. 
 Karyshev who, on the one hand, shares all the Narodnik prejudices and wholehearted-ly sympathises with such classical theoreticians of the pettybourgeoisie as Sismondi (see Karyshev, Perpetual Hereditary Land-Hire on the European Continent , Moscow, 1885), but on the other hand, cannot avoid the admission that land renting gives an “impetus” (p. 
 396) to the differentiation of the peasantry, that the “better-off strata” oust the poorer, and that the development of agrarian rela-tions leads precisely to agricultural wage-labour (p. 
 397) often unable to make economic use of their land and aban-don it. 
 Both columns (total land held and area under crops) show that the purchase and the renting of land lead to a diminution of the share of the bottom groups in the gener-al system of economy, i. 
e. 
, to their being ousted by thewell-to-do minority. 
 The latter now play a dominant rolein the peasant economy, concentrating in their handsalmost as much of the area under crops as do all the rest of the peasants put together. 
 The next two columns show the distribution of draught and other animals among the peasantry. 
 The percentagesof animals differ very slightly from those of area under crops;nor could it be otherwise, for the number of draught animals(and also of other animals) determines the area under crops, and in its turn is determined by it. 
 The next column shows the share of the various groups of the peasantry in the total number of commercial andindustrial establishments. 
 One-fifth of the households (thewell-to-do group) concentrate in their hands about half ofthese establishments, while half the households, the poor, account for about 5,* that is to say, the “industries” that express the conversion of the peasantry into a bourgeoisieare concentrated mainly in the hands of the most affluentcultivators. 
 The well-to-do peasants, consequently, investcapital in agriculture (purchase and renting of land, hireof workers, improvement of implements, etc. 
), industrial establishments, commerce, and usury: merchant’s and entrepreneur capital are closely connected, and surroundingconditions determine which of these forms of capital be-comes predominant. 
 The data on households with “employments” (the first column to the left, among the negative indices) also charac-terise the “industries,” which are, however, of opposite significance, and mark the conversion of the peasant into aproletarian. 
 These “industries” are concentrated in the hands of the poor (they constitute 50% of the households and ac-*Even this figure (about 5 of all the establishments) is, of course, an exaggeration, for the category of non-sowing and horselessand one-horse peasants lumps agricultural labourers, unskilled labour-ers, etc. 
, together with non-cultivators (shopkeepers, artisans, etc. 
). 
 count for 60% to 90% of the total households with employ-ments), whereas the part played in them by the well-to-do groups is insignificant (it must not be forgotten that we have not been able to draw an exact line of demarcation betweenmasters and workers in this category of “industrialists”either). 
 One has only to compare the data on “employments”with the data on “commercial and industrial establish-ments” to see how utterly opposite are these two types of “industries,” and to realise what incredible confusion is created by the customary lumping together of thesetypes. 
 Households employing farm labourers are in all cases con-centrated in the group of well-to-do peasants (20% ofthe households account for 5 to 7 tenths of the total num-ber of farms employing labourers), who (despite their having larger families) cannot exist without a class ofagricultural labourers to “supplement” them. 
 Here wehave a striking confirmation of the proposition expressedabove: that to compare the number of farms employinglabourers with the total number of peasant “farms” (in-cluding the “farms” of the agricultural labourers) is absurd. 
 It is much more correct to compare the number of farms employing labourers with one-fifth of the peasant households, for the well-to-do minority account for about r, or even q, of the total of such farms. 
 The entrepreneur hiring of labourers from among the peasantry far exceeds hiring from necessity, that is, because of a shortage of work-ers in the family: the poor and small-family peasants, con-stituting 50% of the households, account for only about 0 of the total number of farms employing labourers (here too,incidentally, shopkeepers, industrialists, etc. 
, who do nothire workers on account of necessity, are included among the poor). 
 The last column, showing the distribution of improved implements, we could have headed “progressive trends inpeasant farming,” following the example of Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
 The“fairest” distribution of these implements is that in Novo-uzensk Uyezd, Samara Gubernia, where the well-to-do households, constituting one-fifth of the total, have only 73 out of 100 implements, whereas the poor, constitutinghalf the households, have as many as three out of a hundred. 
 Let us now compare the degree of peasant differentiation in the different localities. 
 In the chart two types of locali-ties stand out very clearly in this regard: in Taurida, Samara, Saratov and Perm gubernias the differentiation ofthe agricultural peasantry is markedly more intense thanin Orel, Voronezh and Nizhni-Novgorod gubernias. 
 Thecurves of the first four gubernias in the run belowthe red average line, while those of the last three gubernias run above the average, i. 
e. 
, show a smaller concen-tration of farming in the hands of the well-to-do minority. 
The localities of the first type are the most land-abundantand strictly agricultural (in Perm Gubernia the agricul-tural parts of the uyezds have been singled out), with exten-sive farming. 
 With farming of this character the differentia-tion of the agricultural peasantry is easily noted and therefore clearly visible. 
 Conversely, in the localities ofthe second type we see, on the one hand, a development ofcommercial agriculture such as is not noted in our data;for example, the sowing of hemp in Orel Gubernia. 
 Onthe other hand, we see the tremendous significance of “in-dustries,” both in the sense of work for hire (Zadonsk Uyezd, Voronezh Gubernia) and in the sense of non-agriculturaloccupations (Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia). 
 The significanceof both these circumstances for the question of the differen-tiation of the agricultural peasantry is enormous. 
 Of theformer (the different forms of commercial agriculture and agricultural progress in the different localities) we have already spoken. 
 The significance of the latter (the role ofthe “industries”) is no less obvious. 
 If in a given locality thebulk of the peasants are allotment-holding farm labourers,day labourers or wage-workers in industries, the differentia-tion of the agricultural peasantry will, of course, be marked very feebly. 
 * But to get a proper idea of the matter, these typical representatives of the rural proletariat must be com-pared with typical representatives of the peasant bourgeoi-sie. 
 The allotment-holding Voronezh day labourer who goes *It is quite possible that in the central black-earth gubernias, like Orel, Voronezh and others, the differentiation of the peasantry is indeed much feebler, because of land-poverty, heavy taxationand the wide prevalence of the labour-service system: all these arecircumstances retarding differentiation. 
 south in search of odd jobs must be compared with the Taurida peasant who cultivates huge tracts of land. 
 The Kaluga, Nizhni-Novgorod and Yaroslavl carpenter must be compared with the Yaroslavl or Moscow vegetable grow-er or peasant who keeps cows to sell the milk, etc. 
 Similarly,if the bulk of the peasants in a locality are engaged in themanufacturing industries, their allotments providing themwith only a small part of their means of livelihood, the data on the differentiation of the agricultural peasantry must be supplemented with data on the differentiation of thosewho engage in industries. 
 In Chapter V we shall deal withthis latter question; at the moment we are concerned onlywith the differentiation of the typically agricultural peas-antry. 
 X. 
 SUMMARY OF ZEMSTVO STATISTICS AND ARMY-HORSE CENSUS RETURNS52 We have shown that the relation of the top to the bot-tom group of the peasantry bears the very features that characterise the relation of the rural bourgeoisie to the rural proletariat; that these relationships are remark-ably similar in the most varied localities with the mostvaried conditions; that even their numerical expression(i. 
e. 
, percentages of the groups in the total area undercrops, number of animals, etc. 
) fluctuates within limits that, comparatively speaking, are very small. 
 The question naturally arises: how far can these data on the rela-tionships between the groups in the different localities be utilised for forming an idea of the groups into which the entire Russian peasantry is divided? In other words,what returns can enable us to judge the composition of, and the interrelation between, the top and the bottom groups of the entire Russian peasantry? There are very few of these returns, for no agricultural censuses are taken in Russia that register all the crop-raising farms in the country. 
 The only material by whichwe can judge into which economic groups our peasantry is divided is the combined Zemstvo statistics and the army-horse census returns showing the distribution of draughtanimals (or horses) among the peasant households. 
 Meagre as this material is, one can nevertheless draw from it con-clusions (certainly very general, approximate, aggregate) that are not without interest, particularly since the ratio ofpeasants with many horses to those with few has already been analysed and found to be remarkably similar in the most varied localities. 
 According to the data in Mr. 
 Blagoveshchensky’s Combined Zemstvo House-to-House Census Economic Returns (Vol. 
 I, Peasant Farming , Moscow, 1893), 53 the Zemstvo censuses covered 123 uyezds in 22 gubernias, having 2,983,733 peas-ant households and a population of 17,996,317 persons of both sexes. 
 But the data on the distribution of householdsaccording to draught animals are not everywhere of the same kind. 
 Thus, in three gubernias we have to omit 11 uyezds * where the households are classified not in four, but in only three groups. 
 For the remaining 112 uyezds in 21 gubernias we get the following combined figures covering nearly 2 2 million households with a population of 15 million: Groups of farms With no draught animals 613,238 24.

 For the whole of Russia we have data on the distribution of horses among the peasants in Sta-tistics of the Russian Empire .

 The first publication contains an analysis ofthe data collected in 1888 for 41 gubernias (including the 10 gubernias in the Kingdom of Poland), and the second for 18 gubernias in European Russia, plus the Caucasus,the Kalmyk Steppe and the Don Military Region. 
 Singling out 49 gubernias in European Russia (the returns for Don Region are not complete) and combining thedata for 1888 and 1891, we get the following picture of the distribution of the total number of horses belonging to the peasants in village communities .

6 Thus, all over Russia the distribution of draught horses among the peasantry is very close to the “average” degree of differentiation we have depicted in our chart. 
 Actu-ally, the disintegration is even somewhat deeper: in the hands of 22 per cent of the households (2. 
2 million out of 10. 
2 million) are concentrated 9 2 million horses out of 7 million, i. 
e. 
, 56. 
3% of the total number. 
 A vast massof 2. 
8 million households has none at all, while 2. 
9 million{{ { one-horse households have only 17. 
2% of the total num-ber of horses. 
 * Taking as our basis the above-established regularities in the relationship between the groups, we can now ascertain the real significance of these data. 
 If a fifth of the households possesses a half of the total number of horses, one may unerr-ingly conclude that no less (and probably more) than half the total peasant agricultural production is in their hands. 
 Such a concentration of production is possible only where this well-to-do peasantry concentrates in its hands the major part of the purchased lands and of peasant-rented land, both non-allotment and allotment. 
 It is this well-to-do minority who mainly do the buying and renting of land, despite the fact that in all probability they are best supplied with allotment land. 
 While the “average” Russian peasant in the very best of times barely makes ends meet (and it is doubtful whether he does), the well-to-do minority, whose circumstances are considerably above the average, not only cover all their expenditure by independent farming, but also obtain a surplus. 
 And this means that they are commodity producers, that they grow agriculturalproduce for sale. 
 More, they turn into a rural bourgeoisie, combining with relatively large-scale crop farms commer-cial and industrial enterprises,—we have seen that it is precisely “industries” of this kind that are most typical of the Russian “enterprising” muzhik. 
 Despite the fact that their families are the largest, that they have the largest number of family workers (these features have always been characteristic of the well-to-do peasantry, and the 5 o f the households should account for a large share of the *The way the distribution of horses among the peasantry has been changing latterly can be judged from the following data of the army-horse census of 1893-1894 ( Statistics of the Russian Empire , XXXVII). 
 In 38 gubernias of European Russia there were in 1893-1894: 8,288,987 peasant households; of these, horseless were 2,641,754, or 31.

2%; 3-horse—8.

 Of the total number of Russian peasant farms that resort to the hiring of labourers, a considerable major-ity should be those of this well-to-do minority. 
 We are justified in drawing this conclusion both on the basis of the preceding analysis and from a comparison between the proportion of the population represented by this group and the share it has of the total number of draught animals, and hence of the cultivated area, of farming in general. 
 Lastly, only this well-to-do minority can take a steady part in the “progressive trends in peasant farming. 
”54 Such should be the relation between this minority and therest of the peasantry; but it goes without saying that this relation assumes different forms and manifests itself in other ways depending on differences in agrarian conditions, sys-tems of farming and forms of commercial agriculture. 
 * The main trends of peasant differentiation are one thing;the forms it assumes, depending on the different local con-ditions, are another. 
 The position of the horseless and one-horse peasants is the very opposite. 
 We have seen above that the Zemstvo statisticians put even the latter (to say nothing of the for-mer) in the category of the rural proletariat. 
 Thus, we hard-ly exaggerate in our approximate calculation, which places in the category of the rural proletariat all the horseless and up to w of the one-horse peasants (about half the total households). 
 These peasants, who are worst provided with allotment land, often lease out their allotments because of lack of implements, seed, etc. 
 Of the total peasant-rented and purchased land theirs are but miserable scraps.

 A COMPARISON OF THE ARMY-HORSE CENSUSES OF 1888-1891 AND 1896-1900 The army-horse censuses of 1896 and 1899-1900 enable us now to compare the latest data with those quoted above. 
 By combining the 5 southern gubernias (1896) with 43 of the rest (1899-1900), we get the following data for 48 gubernias of European Russia: 1896-1900 Groups of farms Peasant households Horses owned Horses per Total % Total % household Horseless ...... 3,242,462 29.

5 100 100 A comparison of 1888-1891 and 1896-1900 reveals the growing expropriation of the peasantry. 
 The number of households increased by nearly 1 million. 
 The number ofhorses diminished, although very slightly. 
 The number ofhorseless households increased with particular rapidity, andtheir percentage rose from 27. 
3 to 29. 
2. 
 Instead of 5. 
6 mil-lion poor peasants (horseless and one-horse), we now have{ { {{{ { 16,910,19 6 Tota l...... . 
10,116,66 0 1. 
6 6. 
6 million. 
 The entire increase in the number of households has gone to enlarging the number of poor ones. 
 The per-centage of households rich in horses diminished. 
 Instead of 2. 
2 million households with many horses, we have only2 million. 
 The number of middle and well-to-do householdscombined (with 2 and more horses) remained almost sta-tionary (4,465,000 in 1888-1891 and 4,508,000 in 1896-1900). 
 Thus the conclusions to be drawn from these data are as follows. 
 The increasing poverty and expropriation of the peasant-ry is beyond doubt. 
 As for the relation of the top group of the peasantry to the bottom one, this remained almost unchanged. 
 If, in the manner described above, we constitute the bottomgroups of 50% of the households and the top groups of 20% of the households, we shall get the following: in 1888-1891 the poor, 50% of the households, had 13. 
7% of the horses. 
 The rich, 20% of the households, had 52. 
6%. 
 In 1896-1900 the poor, 50% of the households, also had 13. 
7% of the total peasant-owned horses, while the rich, 20% of the households, had 53. 
2% of the total number of horses. 
Consequently, the relationship between the groups remained almost unchanged. 
 Lastly, the peasantry as a whole became poorer in horses. 
 Both the number and the percentage of the many-horse households decreased. 
 On the one hand, this evidently marks the decline of peasant farming generally in EuropeanRussia. 
 On the other hand, one must not forget that thenumber of horses employed in agriculture in Russia isabnormally high for the area cultivated. 
 It could not be other-wise in a small-peasant country. 
 The drop in the number of horses consequently represents to a certain degree “the res-toration of the normal proportion between the number of draught animals and the amount of arable” among the peasant bourgeoisie (see Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
’s arguments on this point above, in Chapter II, §1). 
 It will be appropriate here to touch on the arguments on this question in the latest works of Mr. 
 Vikhlyayev(“Sketches of Russian Agricultural Reality,” St. 
 Petersburg,published by the magazine Khozyain [Farmer ]) and of Mr. 
 Chernenkov ( A Characterisation of Peasant Farming , Part I, Moscow, 1905). 
 They were so carried away by the diver-sity of the figures on the distribution of horses among the peasantry that they turned economic analysis into a statisticalexercise. 
 Instead of studying the types of peasant farm(day labourer, middle peasant, entrepreneur), they make astudy, like amateurs, of endless columns of figures, just asthough they have set out to astonish the world by their arithmetical zeal. 
 Only thanks to such play with figures was Mr. 
 Chernen-kov able to fling the objection at me that I am “prejudiced”in interpreting “differentiation” as a new (and not old) andfor some reason completely capitalist phenomenon. 
 Mr. 
Chernenkov was, of course, free to think that I was drawing conclusions from statistics and forgetting economics! — that I was proving something from a mere change in thenumber and the distribution of horses! To view intelligent-ly the differentiation of the peasantry, one must take thepicture as a whole: the renting of land, the purchase of land,machines, outside employments, the growth of commercial ag-riculture, and wage-labour. 
 Or maybe Mr. 
 Chernenkov consid-ers these also are neither “new” nor “capitalist” phenomena? XII. 
 ZEMSTVO STATISTICS ON PEASANT BUDGETS To finish with the problem of the differentiation of the peasantry, let us examine it from yet another aspect—thatof the highly specific data of peasant budgets. 
 We shallthus see clearly how profound is the difference between thetypes of peasantry under discussion. 
 In the appendix to Evaluation Returns on Peasant Land-ownership in Zemlyansk , Zadonsk , Korotoyak and Nizhne-devitsk Uyezds (Voronezh, 1889) there are “statistics on the composition and budgets of typical farms,” which are dis-tinguished for their extraordinary completeness. 
 * Of the *A big defect of these data is, firstly, lack of classification according to different indices; secondly, lack of text giving that infor-mation about the farms selected which could not be included in thetables (that sort of text is supplied, for example, to the data on thebudgets for Ostrogozhsk Uyezd). 
 Thirdly, extremely inadequate /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR 67 budgets we leave out one, as being quite incomplete (budget No. 
 14 for Korotoyak Uyezd), and divide the rest into six groups according to draught animals, as follows: a— with no hoses; b—with 1 horse; c—with 2 horses; d— with 3 horses; e—with 4 horses and f—with 5 horses and more (we shall designate the groups only by theseletters a to f). 
 True, classification along these lines is not quite suitable for this locality (in view of the enormous significance of “industries” in the economy of both the bot-tom groups and the top), but we have to take it for the sakeof comparing the budget data with the above-examinedhouse-to-house census data. 
 Such a comparison can only bemade by dividing the “peasantry” into groups, whereasgeneral and all-round “averages” are purely fictitious, as we have seen and shall see further on. 
 * Let us note here, incidentally, the interesting phenomenon that “average”budget figures nearly always characterise the farm of above-average type, i. 
e. 
, they picture the facts in a better lightthan they actually are.

00 100 It is sufficient to glance at the farm expenditure as com-pared with the total expenditure for each group to see thathere we have both proletarians and proprietors : in group a the farm expenditure is only 14% of the total expenditure,whereas in group f it is 61%. 
 The differences in the absolute figures of farm expenditure go without saying. 
 Such expend-iture is negligible in the case not only of the horselessbut also of the one-horse peasant, and the one-horse “peas-ant” is much closer to the ordinary type (in capitalistcountries) of allotment-holding farm labourer and daylabourer. 
 Let us also note the very considerable differencesin the percentage of expenditure on food (a’s nearly double f’s); as we know, a big percentage is evidence of a low stand-ard of living and is what most sharply differentiates thebudget of the proprietor from that of the worker . 
 *The Returns separate all “expenditure on personal and farm needs other than food” from expenditure on the maintenance of ani-mals, and under the first heading, expenditures on lighting and onrent, for example, are put side by side. 
 This is obviously wrong. 
We have separated personal from farm (“productive”) consumption, and under the latter heading we have included expenditure on tar,rope, horse-shoeing, building repairs, implements, harness; on labour-ers and job workers, on herdsman, on the renting of land, and on the maintenance of animals and poultry.

47 Thus, income from “industries” exceeds the gross income from agriculture in the two extreme groups: the proletarian-horseless peasant, and the rural entrepreneur. 
 The “personalindustries” of the bottom peasant groups consist, ofcourse, mainly of work for hire, while income from the leasing of land is an important item in the “miscellaneous incomes. 
” The group of “independent farmers” even includes those whose income from the leasing of land is slightlyless, and sometimes even more, than the gross income fromagriculture. 
 For example, in the case of one horseless peasant,the gross income from agriculture is 61. 
9 rubles, and fromthe leasing of land 40 rubles; in the case of another, the income from agriculture is 31. 
9 rubles and from the leasing of land 40 rubles. 
 It must not be forgotten, furthermore,that the income from the leasing of land and from farmlabouring goes entirely to cover the personal needs of the“peasant,” while from the gross agricultural income we mustdeduct expenditure on the conduct of the farm. 
 After making this deduction, we shall find that the net income of the *The item “balances from previous years” consists of grain (in kind) and cash; here the total figures are given, as we are dealingwith gross expenditure and income, in cash and kind. 
 The four columns relating to “industries” are copied from the Returns , which give no other information about the “industries. 
” Let us observe that in group e, carting should obviously be put under the heading of industrial establishments; it furnishes two membersof this group with 250 rubles income each, and one of them employsa farm labourer. 
from agricul-ture 56 from “indust-ries” balance fromprevious years Total “from per-sonal indus-tries” “from cart-ing” “from indus-trial establish-ments andundertakings” “miscellane-ous incomes” horseless peasant from agriculture is 41. 
99 rubles, and from “industries” 59. 
04 rubles, and in the case of the one-horse peasant, 69. 
37 and 49. 
22 rubles. 
 The mere juxtaposition of these figures shows that we have before us types of ag-ricultural labourers with allotments which cover part of thesubsistence expenditure (and because of this reduce wages). 
To confuse such types of peasants with proprietors (agricul-turists and industrialists) means blatantly to disregard all the requirements of scientific research. 
 At the other pole of the countryside we see just such proprietors as combine with independent crop farming com-mercial and industrial operations which yield an incomethat is considerable (under the given standard of living)and amounts to several hundred rubles. 
 The utter indefinite-ness of the heading “personal industries” conceals the dif-ferences between the bottom and the top groups in thisrespect, but the very size of the incomes from these “per-sonal industries” reveals the extent of this difference (letus remind the reader that in the Voronezh statistics thecategory “personal industries” may include begging, agri-cultural labouring, service as steward, manager, etc. 
, etc. 
). 
 As regards the size of net income, the horseless and one-horse peasants again stand out very sharply, with their most miser-able “balances” (1 to 2 rubles) and even deficits on themoney side. 
 The resources of these peasants are no larger,if not smaller, than those of wage-workers. 
 Only beginning with the 2-horse peasants do we see at least some net incomes and balances of a few dozen rubles (without which therecannot be the slightest question of proper farming). 
 Amongthe well-to-do peasantry net incomes reach sums (120 to 170rubles) that raise them well above the general level of theRussian working class. 
 * *An apparent exception is provided by category e with its big deficit (41 rubles), which, however, is covered by a loan. 
 This isexplained by the fact that in three of the households (out of the 5 in thiscategory) they celebrated weddings that cost 200 rubles. 
 (The totaldeficit of these 5 households amounted to 206 rubles 90 kopeks. 
) As aresult, this group’s expenditure on personal consumption, other than food, rose to the very high figure of 10 rubles 41 kopeks per person of both sexes, whereas in no other group, not excepting the rich group(f), does this expenditure amount to even 6 rubles. 
 Consequently, this deficit is quite opposite in character to that of the poor peasants. 
 Naturally, the combining of workers and employers in one category and the striking of an “average” budget pro-vide a picture of “moderate sufficiency” and of a “moderate” net income: income 491 rubles, expenditure 443 rubles,balance 48 rubles, including 18 rubles in cash. 
 But thatsort of average is absolutely fictitious. 
 It simply concealsthe utter poverty of the mass of peasants in the bottomgroups ( a and b, i. 
e. 
, 30 budgets out of 66), who with their trivial incomes (120 to 180 rubles per family gross income) are unable to make ends meet and live mainly by regularfarm labouring and day labouring. 
 An exact calculation of income and expenditure in cash and kind enables us to determine the relation of the differ-entiation of the peasantry to the market , for which only cash income and expenditure are important. 
 The propor-tion of the cash part of the budget to the total budget in thevarious groups is as follows: Percentage of cash part of expenditure to of income to gross expenditure gross income a) 57.

14 47. 
9 We see, consequently, that the percentage of the cash income and expenditure increases (expenditure with partic-ular regularity) from the middle groups to the extreme ones . 
 The farming is of the most sharply expressed commercial character in the case of the peasant with no horses and of the one with many. 
 This means that both live mainly by selling commodities, except that in the one instance the commodity It is a deficit resulting not from inability to satisfy minimum require-ments, but from increased requirements out of proportion to theincome of the given year. 
 is labour-power, while in the other it is goods produced for sale, with (as we shall see) a considerable employment of wage-labour, i. 
e. 
, a product that assumes the form of capital. 
 In other words, these budgets also show that thedifferentiation of the peasantry creates a home market forcapitalism by converting the peasant into a farm labourer, on the one hand, and into a small-commodity producer,a petty bourgeois, on the other. 
 Another, and no less important, deduction from these data, is that in all the peasant groups farming has to a very large extent become commercial , has become depend-ent upon the market: in no case does the cash part of income or expenditure fall below 40%. 
 And this percentagemust be regarded as a high one, for we are discussing the gross incomes of small agriculturists, in which even the maintenance of cattle is included, i. 
e. 
, straw, bran, etc. 
 * Evidently, even the peasantry in the central black-earthbelt (where money economy is, on the whole, more feeblydeveloped than in the industrial belt, or in the outlyingsteppe regions) cannot exist at all without buying and selling and are already completely dependent on the market, on the power of money . 
 It is needless to say how tremendously important this fact is, and how grave the error our Na-rodniks commit when they try to hush it up, ** being carried away by their sympathies for the natural economy whichhas passed out of existence never to return. 
 In modern society it is impossible to exist without selling, and any-thing that retards the development of commodity productionmerely results in a worsening of the conditions of the pro-ducers. 
 “The disadvantages of the capitalist mode of pro-duction,” says Marx, speaking of the peasant, “. 
 . 
 . 
 coincidehere therefore with the disadvantages occasioned by the imperfect development of the capitalist mode of production. 
 The peasant turns merchant and industrialist without the *Expenditure on the maintenance of cattle is almost entirely in kind: of a total expenditure of 6,316. 
21 rubles on this item by the 66 households, only 1,535. 
2 rubles were spent in cash, and of this sum 1,102. 
5 rubles were spent by one farmer -entrepreneur who kept 20 horses, evidently for industrial use.

57 conditions enabling him to produce his products as commod-ities” ( Das Kapital , III, 2, 346. 
 Russ. 
 trans. 
, p. 
 671). 
58 Let us observe that the budget data utterly refute the view, still fairly widespread, that taxes play an importantpart in the development of commodity production. 
 Undoubt-edly, quit-rents and taxes were at one time an importantfactor in the development of exchange, but at the presenttime commodity economy has become firmly established, and the indicated importance of taxes is becoming altogether secondary. 
 A comparison of the expenditure on taxes andduties with the peasants’ total cash expenditure shows aratio of 15. 
8% (for the respective groups it is: a—24. 
8%; b—21. 
9%; c—19. 
3%; d—18. 
8%; e—15. 
4% and f— 9. 
0%). 
 Hence, the maximum expenditure on taxes is one-third of the remaining cash expenditure unavoidably incurred by the peasant under the present conditions ofsocial economy. 
 If, however, we do not take the role of taxesin the development of exchange, but take them relative tothe income, we shall see that it is an excessively high one. 
How heavily the traditions of the pre-Reform epoch weigh down upon the peasant of today is seen most strikingly in the existence of taxes which absorb one-seventh of thegross expenditure of the small farmer, or even of the allotment-holding farm labourer. 
 Moreover, the distribu-tion of taxes within the village community is astonishinglyuneven: the better off the peasant, the smaller the part of his total expenditure that goes in taxes. 
 The horseless peas-ant pays in proportion to his income nearly three times asmuch as the peasant owning many horses (see above, tableon distribution of expenditure). 
 We speak of the distribu-tion of taxes within the village community, because if wecalculate the amount of taxes and duties per dessiatine of allotment land, it will be found to be nearly uniform. 
 After all that has been stated, this unevenness should notastonish us; it is inevitable in our village community,so long as the village community retains its compulsory,feudal character. 
 As we know, the peasants share all taxesaccording to land held: share of taxes and share of land merge in their minds in the one concept “soul,” or person.

—Trirogov, The Village Community and we have seen, however, the differentiation of the peasantry leads to a diminution of the role of allotment land at both poles of the contemporary countryside. 
 Naturally, under such conditions the distribution of taxes according to allot-ment land held (which is inseparably connected with thecompulsory nature of the village community) leads to theshifting of the tax burden from the well-to-do peasantsto the poor. 
 The village community (i. 
e.

3 tal This table graphically illustrates the difference in the ex-tent to which the various groups are provided with imple-ments and livestock, a point we mentioned above on thebasis of the mass data. 
 We see here the completely differ-ent degree to which the various groups hold property, this difference being such that even the horses of the poor peas-ant are very different from those of the affluent peasant. 
 * The horse of the one-horse peasant is a veritable “livingfraction”—not a “quarter of a horse,” to be sure, but fully“twenty-seven fifty-seconds” of a horse! **61 *German agricultural literature includes several monographs by Drechsler containing data on the weight of the cattle owned by farmers of various groups, classified according to amount of landheld. 
 60 These data show even more strikingly than the figures we have cited from Russian Zemstvo statistics the immeasurably inferior quality of the cattle owned by the small peasants as compared with those owned by the big peasants, particularly by the landlords. 
 I hopeto analyse these data for the press in the near future. 
 ( Note to 2nd edition . 
) **If these budget standards of the value of buildings, imple-ments and animals to be found in the various groups of peasants were applied to the summary data for 49 gubernias of European Russia that were cited above, it would be seen that one-fifth of the peasanthouseholds owns a considerably larger quantity of means of produc-tion than all the rest of the peasantry.

60 These data are very eloquent. 
 They strikingly reveal to us how utterly wretched is the “farm” not only of thehorseless but also of the one-horse peasant; and how utterly wrong is the customary method of lumping such peasants with the few but powerful peasants who spend hundredsof rubles on their farms, are in a position to improve theirimplements, hire “working folk,” and “buy in ” land on a large scale, renting to the amount of 50, 100 and 200 ru-bles a year. 
 ** Let us note, by the way, that the relatively high expenditure of the horseless peasant on “labourers and job-work” is very likely to be explained by the factthat the statisticians have placed under this heading twoentirely different things: the hiring of a worker who hasto work with his employer’s implements, i.

 Let us now examine the data on income from agriculture. 
 Unfortunately, in the Returns these data are far too inadequately analysed (partly, maybe, because of theirpaucity). 
 For example, the question of yield is not examined:there is no information on the sale of each particular kind of produce and on the conditions of sale.

67 What immediately strikes one in this table is the glaring exception: the huge drop in the percentage of cash income from agriculture in the top group, despite the fact that it cultivates the biggest area. 
 Farming on the biggest scaleis thus apparently in the greatest degree natural economy. 
It will be extremely interesting to make a closer examina-tion of this seeming exception, which throws light on thehighly important question of the connection between agriculture and “industries” of an entrepreneur character. 
 As we have already seen, the significance of industries ofthis type is particularly great in the budgets of the peas-ants owning many horses. 
 Judging from the data underexamination, especially typical of the peasant bourgeoisiein this locality is the tendency to combine agriculture with A page from V.

 Farming on the biggest scaleis thus apparently in the greatest degree natural economy. 
It will be extremely interesting to make a closer examina-tion of this seeming exception, which throws light on thehighly important question of the connection between agriculture and “industries” of an entrepreneur character. 
 As we have already seen, the significance of industries ofthis type is particularly great in the budgets of the peas-ants owning many horses. 
 Judging from the data underexamination, especially typical of the peasant bourgeoisiein this locality is the tendency to combine agriculture with commercial and industrial enterprises. 
 * It is not difficult to see, firstly, that it is wrong to compare farmers of this type with cultivators pure and simple, and, secondly, that agriculture under such circumstances very often only seemsto be natural economy. 
 When agriculture is combined withthe technical processing of agricultural produce (flour-milling, oil-pressing, potato-starch manufacture, distilling,etc. 
), the money income from such farming may be assigned to income from the industrial establishments and not from agriculture. 
 Actually, indeed, the agriculture in thiscase will be commercial, not natural, economy. 
 The samething has to be said of the farm in which a mass of agri-cultural produce is consumed in kind on the maintenanceof farm labourers and of horses employed on some indus-trial enterprise (for example, mail-carrying). 
 And it is precisely this type of farm that we have among the top group(budget No. 
 1 in Korotoyak Uyezd. 
 Family of 18 persons,4 working members, 5 farm labourers, 20 horses; incomefrom agriculture—1,294 rubles, nearly all in kind, andfrom industrial enterprises—2,675 rubles. 
 And such a “natural-economy peasant farm” is combined with the horseless and one-horse farms for the purpose of strikinga general “average”). 
 This example shows us once againhow important it is to combine classification accordingto scale and type of agricultural activity with classificationaccording to scale and type of “industrial” activity. 
 (C) Let us now examine the data on the peasants’ standard of living. 
 Expenditure on food in kind is givenincompletely in the Returns . 
 We single out the most important items: agricultural produce and meat. 
 ** *Of the 12 horseless peasants not one obtains any income from industrial establishments and undertakings; of the 18 with one horse each, one does; of the 17 with two horses two do; of the 9 with three horses three do; of the 5 with four horses two do; of the 5 owning morethan 4 horses four do. 
 **Under this head we combine the following items in the Returns : beef, mutton, pork and lard. 
 Where other cereals are calculated interms of rye it is according to the standards in Yanson’s Comparative Statistics adopted by the Nizhni-Novgorod statisticians (see Mate-rial for Gorbatov Uyezd.

21 This table shows that we were right in combining the horseless and one-horse peasants and contrasting them tothe rest. 
 The distinguishing feature of the groups of peasantsmentioned is insufficiency of food and its inferior quality(potatoes). 
 The food of the one-horse peasant is in some respects even worse than that of the horseless peasant. 
 The general “average” even on this question is entirelyfictitious, the insufficient nourishment of the mass of thepeasants being obscured by the satisfactory nourishment ofthe well-off peasantry, who consume almost one and a halftimes as much agricultural produce and three times as much meat * as do the poor peasants. 
 For the purpose of comparing the remaining data on the peasants’ food, all produce must be taken at its value—in rubles: *The extent to which the meat consumption of the village peas-ants is smaller than that of town dwellers is seen from even the follow-ing fragmentary data. 
 In Moscow in 1900, cattle weighing about 4million poods and of a total value of 18,986,714 rubles 59 kopeks were slaughtered in the city abattoirs ( Moskovskiye Vedomosti [Moscow Recorder ], 1901, No. 
 55). 
 This works out per head, both sexes, at about 4 poods or nearly 18 rubles per annum.

40 Thus, the general data on the peasants’ food confirm what has been said above. 
 Three groups stand out clearly: the bot-tom group (horseless and one-horse), the middle group (two-and three-horse), and the top group, whose food is nearlytwice as good as that of the bottom one. 
 The general “average” wipes out both extreme groups. 
 Cash expenditure on food is highest, both absolutely and relatively, in thetwo extreme groups—among the rural proletarians and therural bourgeoisie. 
 The former buy more , although they con-sume less , than the middle peasants; they buy the most essential agricultural produce, that of which they suffer a shortage. 
 The latter buy more because they consume more, increasing particularly their consumption of non-agricultural produce. 
 A comparison of these two extremegroups shows us clearly how a home market is created in acapitalist country for articles of personal consumption. 
 *** *Beef, pork, lard, mutton, butter, dairy produce, poultry and eggs. 
 **Salt, salted and fresh fish, herrings, vodka, beer, tea and sugar. 
 *** Of the money expenditure on agricultural produce first place goes to the purchase of rye, mainly by the poor, then the purchase of vegetables Expenditure on vegetables is valued at 85 kopeks per head of both sexes (ranging from 56 kopeks in group b to 1 ruble 31 kopeks in group e), including 47 kopeks in money. 
 This interesting fact shows us that even among the rural population, not to speak of the urban, a market is created for the produce of one of the forms of commercial agriculture, namely, market gardening. 
 Expenditure on vegetable oil is q in kind; that is to say, in this sphere domestic production and primitive handicraft still prevail.

87 It is not always correct to calculate this expenditure per head of both sexes, because the cost of fuel, lighting, house-hold effects, etc. 
, for example, is not proportionate to the number of members of the family. 
 These data also show the division of the peasantry (accord-ing to standard of living) into three different groups. 
Moreover, the following interesting peculiarity comes to light: the cash part of the expenditure on all personal con-sumption is highest in the bottom groups (in group a about half the expenditure is in money), whereas in the top groups the cash expenditure does not increase, amounting to only about a third. 
 How can this be reconciled with the above-noted fact that, in general, the percentage of money expend-iture increases in both extreme groups? Obviously in the top groups the cash expenditure is incurred mainly on pro-ductive consumption (expenditure on the farm), whereas in the bottom groups it is on personal consumption . 
 Here are the exact data on this:Groups property, clothing fuel (straw) clothing, footwear lighting other domestic needs total personal con-sumption other than of food of which in money Total on food and other consumption of which in money % of cash Cash expenditure per farm S a m e i n % part in (rubles) expenditure on a) 39.

6 Consequently, the transformation of the peasantry into a rural proletariat creates a market mainly for articles of consumption, whereas its transformation into a rural bour-geoisie creates a market mainly for means of production. 
In other words, among the bottom groups of the “peasantry”we observe the transformation of labour-power into a com-modity, and in the top ones the transformation of means of production into capital. 
 Both these transformations result in precisely that process of the creation of a home mar-ket which theory has established for capitalist countriesin general. 
 That is why F. 
 Engels, writing on the famineof 1891, said that it signified the creation of a home market for capitalism 63—a proposition that is unintelligible to the Narodniks, who regard the ruin of the peasantry merely as the decay of “people’s production,” and not as the trans-formation of patriarchal into capitalist economy. 
 Mr. 
 N. 
 —on has written a whole book on the home mar-ket, without noticing the process of the creation of a home market by the differentiation of the peasantry. 
 In his article “How Are We to Explain the Increase in Our State Revenues?” ( Novoye Slovo [New Word ], 1896, No. 
 5, Feb-ruary) he deals with this question in the following argu-ment: the tables of the income of the American worker show that the lower the income, the larger is the relative expenditure on food. 
 Consequently, with a decline in foodGroups on personal consumption on the farm on taxes and duties Total on personal consumption on the farm on taxes and duties Total personal con-sumption the farm consumption there is a still greater decline in the consump-tion of other products. 
 And in Russia there is a decline in the consumption of bread and vodka; hence there is also a decline in the consumption of other products, from whichit follows that the greater consumption of the well-to-do“stratum” (p. 
 70) of the peasantry is more than balancedby the diminution of the consumption of the masses. 
—Thisargument contains three errors: firstly, by substituting the worker for the peasant, Mr. 
 N. 
 —on skips over the question; the point at issue is the process of the creation of workers and employers . 
 Secondly, by substituting the worker for the peasant, Mr. 
 N. 
 —on reduces all consumption to per-sonal consumption and forgets about productive consump-tion, about the market for means of production. 
 Thirdly, Mr. 
 N. 
 —on forgets that the process of the differentiation of the peasantry is at the same time one of the displace-ment of natural by commodity economy, that, consequently,the market cannot be created by increasing consumption,but by transforming consumption in kind (even if moreabundant) into cash or paying consumption (even if less abundant). 
 We have just seen that the horseless peasants consume less, but buy more articles of personal consump-tion than the middle peasantry. 
 They become poorer,but at the same time receive and spend more money,—andboth these sides of the process are necessary for capitalism. 
 * In conclusion, let us make use of the budget figures to compare the standard of living of the peasants and therural workers. 
 Calculating the extent of personal consump-tion, not per head, but per adult working person (accordingto the rates of the Nizhni-Novgorod statisticians in the above-mentioned compilation), we get the following table: *This fact, which at first sight seems a paradox, is actually fully in keeping with the fundamental contradictions of capitalism, which are met with at every step in real life. 
 That is why close observers ofrural life have been able to note this fact quite independently of theory. 
 “For the development of his activities,” says Engelhardt about the kulak, the huckster, etc. 
, “it is important that the peasants (Letters from the Countryside , p. 
 493). 
 Engelhardt’s sympathy for a substantial (sic!!) agricultural life” (ibid. 
) did not prevent him at times from disclosing the most profound contradictions within the celebrated village community.

9 To compare the data on the standard of living of rural workers with this, we may take, firstly, average prices oflabour. 
 For 10 years (1881-1891) the average pay of a farmlabourer hired by the year in Voronezh Gubernia was 57rubles, and including keep, 99 rubles, * so that keep cost 42 rubles. 
 The amount of personal consumption by allot-ment-holding farm labourers and day labourers (horselessand one-horse peasants) is below this level. 
 The total cost of a family’s keep amounts to only 78 rubles in the caseof the horseless “peasant” (in a family of 4) and 98 rublesin the case of the one-horse “peasant” (in a family of 5),i. 
e. 
, less than the cost of a farm labourer ’s keep . 
 (We have omitted from the budgets of the horseless and one-horsepeasants farm expenditure and also taxes and duties, forin this locality the allotment is leased at not less than theamount of the taxes. 
) As was to be expected, the positionof the labourer who is tied to his allotment is worse thanthat of the labourer who is free from such tie (we say noth-ing of the tremendous degree to which the tying of peopledown to allotments develops relations of bondage andpersonal dependence). 
 The cash expenditure of the farmlabourer is far higher than the cash expenditure onpersonal consumption of the one-horse and horseless peasant.

3 Consequently, the standard of living of the one-horse and horseless peasants is not higher than that of farm labourers , and if anything rather approximates to the mini-mum standard of living of the latter. 
 The general conclusion from our review of the data on the bottom group of the peasantry is, accordingly, the follow-ing: both in its relation to the other groups, which areousting the bottom section of the peasantry from agri-culture, in its scale of farming, which covers only part ofthe expenditure on maintaining the family, in its sourceof livelihood (sale of labour-power), and, lastly, in its *The difference between the conditions in Orel and Voronezh gubernias is slight, and, as we shall see, the data given are of the usual kind. 
 We do not take the data in the above-mentioned workof S. 
 A. 
 Korolenko (see the juxtaposition of those data in Mr. 
 Ma-ress’s article in The Influence of Harvests , etc. 
, I, 11), for even the author himself admits that Messrs. 
 the landowners from whom these Computed in the manner stated above. 
{ { data were obtained sometimes “were carried away” . 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 standard of living, this group should be assigned to the allotment-holding farm labourers and day labourers . 
* In thus concluding our exposition of the Zemstvo statis-tics on peasant budgets, we cannot but stop to examinethe methods of treating the budget data employed byMr. 
 Shcherbina, the compiler of Evaluation Returns and author of the article on peasant budgets in the well-knownbook The Influence of Harvests and Grain Prices , etc. 
 (Vol. 
 II). 
 64 Mr. 
 Shcherbina states on some point in the Returns that he is using the theory “of the well-known politicaleconomist K. 
 Marx” (p. 
 111); as a matter of fact, he posi-tively distorts this theory, confusing the difference betweenconstant and variable capital with the difference betweenfixed and circulating capital (ibid. 
), and quite senselessly applying these terms and categories of developed capi-talism to peasant farming (passim), etc. 
 The whole ofMr. 
 Shcherbina’s treatment of the budget figures is nothingbut a gross and incredible abuse of “average magnitudes. 
”All the evaluation returns concern the “average” peasant. 
The income from the land computed for the 4 uyezds is divided by the number of farms (recall that for the horseless peasant this income is about 60 rubles per family, and forthe rich peasant about 700 rubles). 
 The “magnitude of con-stant capital” (sic!!?) “per farm ” (p. 
 114), i. 
e. 
, the value of the whole property, is determined; the “average” valueof implements, the average value of commercial and industrial establishments (sic!) is determined as 15 rubles per farm. 
 Mr. 
 Shcherbina ignores the detail that theseestablishments are the private property of the well-to-dominority, and divides them among all “equally”! The “average”expenditure on the renting of land (p. 
 118) is determined; *The Narodniks will probably draw from our comparison between the standard of living of farm labourers and that of the bottom groupof the peasantry, the conclusion that we “stand for” dispossessing thepeasantry of the land, etc. 
 Such a conclusion will be a wrong one. 
All that follows from what has been said is that we “stand for” abol-ishing all restrictions on the peasants’ right freely to dispose of their land, to give up their allotments, and to leave the village community. 
Only the peasant himself can be the judge of whether it is more advan-tageous to be a farm labourer with an allotment or without one. 
Hence such restrictions can on no account and in no way be justified. 
The defence of these restrictions by the Narodniks, on the other hand, as we have seen, it amounts to 6 rubles in the case of the one-horse peasant and to 100 to 200 rubles in the case of the rich peasant. 
 All this is added together and divided by the number of farms. 
 Even the “average” expenditure on “repairof capitals” is determined (ibid. 
). 
 The Lord alone knows whatthat means! If it means replenishment and repair of imple-ments and livestock, here are the figures we have alreadycited: with the horseless peasant this expenditure equals 8 (eight ) kopeks per farm, and with the rich peasant 75 rubles . 
 Is it not evident that if we add such “peasant farms” together and divide by the number of items added,we shall get the “law of average requirements” discoveredby Mr. 
 Shcherbina in the returns for Ostrogozhsk Uyezd(Vol. 
 II, Pt. 
 2, 1887) and so brilliantly applied subsequently? And from such a “law” it will not be difficult to draw the conclusion that “the peasant satisfies not his minimum require-ments, but their average level” (p. 
 123 and many others),that peasant farming is a special “type of development”(p. 
 100), etc. 
, etc. 
 This ingenuous device of “equalising” therural proletariat and the peasant bourgeoisie is reinforced by the already familiar classification according to allotment. 
 Had we applied it, for example, to the budget data, we wouldhave combined in one group such peasants, for example(in the category of those having large allotments, with15 to 25 dess. 
 per family), as: one who leases half his allot-ment (of 23. 
5 dess. 
) sows 1. 
3 dess. 
, lives mainly by means of “personal industries” (how surprisingly well this sounds!) and secures an income of 190 rubles for 10 persons of bothsexes (budget No. 
 10 in Korotoyak Uyezd); and anotherwho rents an additional 14. 
7 dess. 
, sows 23. 
7 dess. 
, employsfarm labourers and has an income of 1,400 rubles for 10 per-sons of both sexes (budget No. 
 2 in Zadonsk Uyezd). 
 Is it not clear that we shall get a special “type of development” if we add the farms of farm labourers and day labourers tothose of peasants employing workers, and divide the totalby the number of items added? One has only to make regu-lar and exclusive use of “average” data on peasant farming,and all “false ideas” about the differentiation of the peas-antry will be eliminated once and for all. 
 That is exactly what Mr. 
 Shcherbina does by adopting this method en grand * in his article in the book The Influence of Harvests , etc. 
 Here a huge effort is made to calculate the budgets of the whole of the Russian peasantry—and all by means of the very same, tried and tested, “averages. 
” The future historianof Russian economic literature will note with astonishmentthat the prejudices of Narodism caused the most elementaryrequirements of economic statistics to be forgotten, namely,that a strict distinction be drawn between employers and wage-workers, regardless of the form of land tenure that unites them, and regardless of the multiplicity and varietyof the intermediary types between them. 
 XIII. 
 CONCLUSIONS CHAPTER II Let us sum up the main points that follow from the data examined above: 1) The social-economic situation in which the contempo-rary Russian peasantry find themselves is that of commodityeconomy. 
 Even in the central agricultural belt (whichis most backward in this respect as compared with the south-eastern border regions or the industrial gubernias), the peasant is completely subordinated to the market, on whichhe is dependent as regards both his personal consumptionand his farming, not to mention the payment of taxes. 
 2) The system of social-economic relations existing among the peasantry (agricultural and village-community) shows us the presence of all those contradictions which are inherent in every commodity economy and every order ofcapitalism: competition, the struggle for economic independ-ence, the grabbing of land (purchasable and rentable),the concentration of production in the hands of a minority,the forcing of the majority into the ranks of the proletariat, their exploitation by a minority through the medium of merchant’s capital and the hiring of farm labourers. 
 Thereis not a single economic phenomenon among the peasantrythat does not bear this contradictory form, one specificallypeculiar to the capitalist system, i. 
e. 
, that does not expressa struggle and antagonism of interests, that does not imply advantage for some and disadvantage for others. 
 It is the case with the renting of land, the purchase of land, and with “industries” in their diametrically opposite types; it is We attach cardinal importance to this conclusion not only as regards capitalism in Russia, but also as regards the sig-nificance of the Narodnik doctrine in general. 
 It is these contradictions that show us clearly and irrefutably that thesystem of economic relations in the “community” villagedoes not at all constitute a special economic form (“people’sproduction,” etc. 
), but is an ordinary petty-bourgeois one. 
Despite the theories that have prevailed here during the past half-century, the Russian community peasantry are not antagonists of capitalism, but, on the contrary, are its deepestand most durable foundation. 
 The deepest—because it ishere, remote from all “artificial” influences, and in spite ofthe institutions which restrict the development of capital-ism, that we see the constant formation of the elements of capitalism within the “community” itself. 
 The most durable—because agriculture in general, and the peasantryin particular, are weighed down most heavily by the tradi-tions of the distant past, the traditions of patriarchal life,as a consequence of which the transformative effects ofcapitalism (the development of the productive forces, the changing of all social relations, etc. 
) manifest themselves here most slowly and gradually. 
 * 3) The sum-total of all the economic contradictions among the peasantry constitutes what we call the differentiationof the peasantry. 
 The peasants themselves very aptly andstrikingly characterise this process with the term “depeas-antising. 
” ** This process signifies the utter dissolution of the old, patriarchal peasantry and the creation of new types of rural inhabitants. 
 Before we proceed to describe these types, let us note the following. 
 Reference to this process was made in ourliterature long ago and has been repeated very often. 
 For example, in his day Mr. 
 Vasilchikov, who made use of the works of the Valuyev Commission, 66 noted the formation of a “rural proletariat” in Russia and the “differentiationof the peasant social estate” ( Landownership and Agricul-ture , 1st ed. 
, Vol. 
 I, Chapter IX). 
 This fact was also men-tioned by V. 
 Orlov ( Statistical Returns for Moscow Gubernia , Vol. 
 IV, Pt. 
 1, p. 
 14) and by many others. 
 But all these *Cf. 
 Das Kapital , I2, S. 
 527. 
65 references were very fragmentary. 
 No attempt was ever made to study this phenomenon systematically, and that is why we lack, to this day, adequate information about this phenomenon notwithstanding the wealth of data pro-vided by the Zemstvo house-to-house censuses. 
 Connectedwith this is the fact that the majority of the writerswho have dealt with this problem regard the break-upof the peasantry simply as the emergence of property inequality, as simple “differentiation,” to use the favourite term of the Narodniks in general and of Mr. 
 Karyshev inparticular (see his book on Rentings and his articles in Rus-skoye Bogatstvo ). 
 Undoubtedly, the emergence of property inequality is the starting-point of the whole process, but theprocess is not at all confined to property “differentiation. 
” The old peasantry is not only “differentiating,” it is being completely dissolved, it is ceasing to exist, it is being oustedby absolutely new types of rural inhabitants—types thatare the basis of a society in which commodity economy andcapitalist production prevail. 
 These types are the ruralbourgeoisie (chiefly petty bourgeoisie) and the rural prole-tariat—a class of commodity producers in agriculture and a class of agricultural wage-workers. 
 It is extremely instructive that the purely theoretical analysis of the process of the formation of agriculturalcapitalism points to the differentiation of the small produc-ers as an important factor in this process. 
 We have in mind one of the most interesting chapters in Vol. 
 III of Capital , namely Chapter 47, “Genesis of Capitalist Ground-Rent. 
”As the starting-point of this genesis Marx takes labour-rent (Arbeitsrente) *—“. 
 . 
 . 
 where the direct producer, using instruments of labour (plough, cattle, etc. 
) which actuallyor legally belong to him, cultivates soil actually owned by him during part of the week, and works during the remaining days upon the estate of the feudal lord without *In the Russian translation (p. 
 651 and foll. 
) this term is given as “trudovaya renta” (“trudovaya” is the adjectival form of “trud”—labour. 
— Ed. 
). 
 We think that our translation (“otrabotochnaya renta”— from “otrabotat,” to work off, to pay off by labour. 
— Ed. 
) is more correct, for the Russian language contains the specific term “otrabotki”(labour-service) which means precisely the work of the dependent peasant for the landowner. 
 67 III, 2, 323. 
 Russ. 
 trans. 
, 651). 
 The next form of rent is rent in kind (Produktenrente), when the direct producer produces the entire product on land which he himself exploits, and gives up to the landowner the whole of the surplus productin kind. 
 The producer here becomes more independent andis enabled to acquire by his labour a certain surplus overand above the amount of produce that satisfies his indis-pensable needs. 
 “Similarly, this form” of rent “will give rise to greater differences in the economic position of theindividual direct producers. 
 At least the possibility forsuch a differentiation exists, and the possibility for thedirect producer to have in turn acquired the means to exploitother labourers directly” (S. 
 329. 
 Russ. 
 trans. 
, 657. 
) 68 And so, while natural economy still prevails, at the veryfirst expansion of the independence of the dependent peas-ants, there already appear the germs of their differentia-tion. 
 But these germs can develop only under the nextform of rent, money rent , which represents a mere change in the form of rent in kind. 
 The direct producer gives up to the landowner not produce, but the price of this produce. 
 * The basis of this type of rent remains the same: the di-rect producer is as hitherto the traditional possessor of theland, but “the basis of this type of rent . 
 . 
 . 
 is approachingits dissolution” (330). 
 Money rent “presupposes a consid-erable development of commerce, of urban industry, of commodity production in general, and thereby of money circulation” (331). 
 69 The traditional, common-law relation-ship between the dependent peasant and the landowner istransformed here into a purely cash, contract-based *A strict distinction must be drawn between money rent and capitalist ground-rent the latter presupposes the existence in agri-culture of capitalists and wage-workers; the former the existenceof dependent peasants. 
 Capitalist rent is that part of surplus-valuewhich remains after the deduction of the employer’s profit, whereas money rent is the price of the entire surplus product paid by the peas-ant to the landowner. 
 An example of money rent in Russia is thequitrent paid by the peasant to the landlord. 
 Undoubtedly, the taxeswhich our peasants now have to pay represent, in part, money rent. 
Sometimes peasant renting of land also approximates to the payingof money rent; that is when the high rent the peasant has to pay for the land leaves him no more than a meagre wage. 
any compensation from the feudal lord. 
 . 
 . 
” ( Das Kapital , relationship. 
 This leads, on the one hand, to the expropria-tion of the old peasantry, and, on the other, to the peasant buying out his land and his liberty. 
 The transformation of rent in kind into money rent is furthermore not onlyinevitably accompanied, but even anticipated, by theformation of a class of propertyless day labourers, whohire themselves out for money. 
 During their genesis, whenthis new class appears but sporadically, the custom neces-sarily develops among the more prosperous peasants subject to rent payments (rentepflichtigen) of exploiting agri-cultural wage-labourers for their own account. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 In thisway, they gradually acquire the possibility of accumulat-ing a certain amount of wealth and themselves becomingtransformed into future capitalists. 
 The old self-employed possessors of land themselves thus give rise to a nursery school for capitalist tenants, whose development isconditioned by the general development of capitalistproduction beyond the bounds of the countryside”(Das Kapital , III, 2, 332. 
 Russ. 
 trans. 
, 659-660). 
 70 4) The differentiation of the peasantry, which develops the latter’s extreme groups at the expense of the middle “peasantry,” creates two new types of rural inhabitants. 
The feature common to both types is the commodity, moneycharacter of their economy. 
 The first new type is the ruralbourgeoisie or the well-to-do peasantry. 
 These include theindependent farmers who carry on commercial agriculture in all its varied forms (the principal ones of which we shall describe in Chapter IV), then come the owners of commer-cial and industrial establishments, the proprietors ofcommercial enterprises, etc. 
 The combining of commercialagriculture with commercial and industrial enterprises isthe type of “combination of agriculture with industries” that is specifically peculiar to this peasantry. 
 From among these well-to-do peasants a class of capitalist farmers iscreated, since the renting of land for the sale of grain plays(in the agricultural belt) an enormous part in their farms,often a more important part than the allotment. 
 The sizeof the farm, in the majority of cases, requires a labour force larger than that available in the family, for which reason the formation of a body of farm labourers, and still moreof day labourers, is a necessary condition for the existence of the well-to-do peasantry. 
 * The spare cash obtained by these peasants in the shape of net income is either directed towards commercial operations and usury, which are so excessively developed in our rural districts, or, underfavourable conditions, is invested in the purchase of land,farm improvements, etc. 
 In a word, these are small agrar-ians. 
 Numerically, the peasant bourgeoisie constitute asmall minority of the peasantry, probably not more than one-fifth of the total number of households (which is approximately three-tenths of the population), although, ofcourse, the proportion fluctuates considerably according todistrict. 
 But as to their weight in the sum-total of peasantfarming, in the total, quantity of means of productionbelonging to the peasantry, in the total amount of produce raised by the peasantry, the peasant bourgeoisie are undoubtedly predominant. 
 They are the masters of thecontemporary countryside. 
 5) The other new type is the rural proletariat, the class of allotment-holding wage-workers . 
 This covers the poor peasants, including those that are completely landless; but the most typical representative of the Russian rural pro-letariat is the allotment-holding farm labourer, day labourer,unskilled labourer, building worker or other allotment-holding worker. 
 Insignificant farming on a patch of land,with the farm in a state of utter ruin (particularly evidencedby the leasing out of land), inability to exist without the sale of labour-power ( =“industries” of the indigent peasants), an extremely low standard of living (probably lower eventhan that of the worker without an allotment)—such are thedistinguishing features of this type. 
 ** One must assign not less than half the total peasant households (which is *Let us note that the employment of wage-labour is not an essential feature of the concept “petty bourgeoisie. 
” This concept covers all independent production for the market, where the socialsystem of economy contains the contradictions described by us above(Sec. 
 2), particularly where the mass of producers are transformedinto wage-workers. 
 **To prove that it is correct to assign the indigent peasants to the class of allotment-holding wage-workers, one must show not only how, and what sort of, peasants sell labour-power, but also howand what sort of, employers buy labour-power. 
 This will be shown insubsequent chapters. 
 approximately /FL0058 of the population) to membership of the rural proletariat, i. 
e. 
, all the horseless and a large part of the one-horse peasants (this, of course, is only a wholesale, approximate calculation, one subject to more or less consid-erable modifications in the different areas, according tolocal conditions). 
 The grounds which compel us to believethat such a considerable proportion of the peasantry alreadybelong to the rural proletariat have been advanced above. 
 * It should be added that our literature frequently containstoo stereotyped an understanding of the theoretical propo-sition that capitalism requires the free, landless worker. 
This proposition is quite correct as indicating the maintrend, but capitalism penetrates into agriculture partic-ularly slowly and in extremely varied forms. 
 The allotment of land to the rural worker is very often to the interests of the rural employers themselves, and that is why theallotment-holding rural worker is a type to be found in allcapitalist countries. 
 The type assumes different forms indifferent countries: the English cottager is not the same asthe small-holding peasant of France or the Rhine provinces, and the latter again is not the same as the Knecht in Prussia. 
 Each of these bears traces of a specific agrarian system, ofa specific history of agrarian relations—but this does notprevent the economist from classing them all as one typeof agricultural proletarian. 
 The juridical basis of his rightto his plot of land is absolutely immaterial to such a classification. 
 Whether the land is his full property (as a *Prof. 
 Conrad considers the criterion for the real peasant in Germany to be ownership of a pair of draught animals (Gespann-bauerngüter), see Landownership and Agriculture (Moscow, 1896, pp. 
 84-85). 
 For Russia the criterion should rather be put higher. 
 Indefining the concept “peasant,” what Conrad takes is the percentage ofpersons or households engaged in “hired labour” or “subsidiary industries” generally (ibid. 
),—Prof Stebut, who cannot be denied authority on questions of fact, wrote in 1882 : “Since the fall of serfdom, the peasant with his small economic unit, engaged exclusively ingrowing grain, that is to say, principally in the central black-earthbelt of Russia, has in the majority of cases become an artisan, a farmlabourer or a day labourer, for whom agriculture is only a subsidiary occupation” (“Articles on Russian Agriculture, Its Defects and the Measures for Its Improvement,” Moscow, 1883, p. 
 11) Evidentlythe artisans here also include wage-workers in industry (building,etc. 
) However incorrect this use of terms, it is very widespread in small-holding peasant), or whether he is only allowed the use of it by the landlord or the Rittergutsbesitzer, * or, finally, whether he possesses it as a member of a Great-Russian peasant community—makes no difference at all. 
 ** In assigning the indigent peasants to the rural proletariatwe are saying nothing new. 
 This term has already beenused repeatedly by many writers, and only the Narodnikeconomists persist in speaking of the peasantry in gen-eral, as of something anti-capitalist, and close their eyes to the fact that the mass of the “peasantry” have alreadytaken a quite definite place in the general system of capi-talist production, namely, as agricultural and industrialwage-workers. 
 In our country, people are very fond ofsinging the praises of our agrarian system, which retains the village community and the peasantry, etc. 
, and of contrasting this to the Ostsee system, with its capitalistorganisation of agriculture. 
 It will not be without interest,therefore, to see what types of the agricultural populationin the Ostsee region 72 are sometimes assigned to the class of farm labourers and day labourers. 
 The peasants in the Ostsee gubernias are divided into those with large plots (25 to 50 dess. 
 in separate lots), cottagers (with plots of3 to 10 dess. 
) and landless peasants. 
 As Mr. 
 S. 
 Korolenko *Lord of the manor. 
— Ed. 
 **Let us quote examples of the various European forms of wage-labour in agriculture from the Handwört der Staatswiss . 
 (Land-ownership and Agriculture , Moscow, 1896). 
 “The peasants’ holding,” says J. 
 Conrad, “must be distinguished from the parcel , from the patch of the ‘landless peasant’ or the ‘market gardener,’ the owner of which is obliged to seek additionally outside occupation and employment”(pp. 
 83-84). 
 “In France, according to the 1881 census, 18 million per-sons, i. 
e. 
, somewhat less than half the population, obtained theirlivelihood in agriculture about 9 million owners of land, 5 milliontenant farmers and half-croppers, 4 million day labourers and owners of small plots, or tenants obtaining their livelihood mainly by wage-in France have their own land” (p. 
 233, Goltz). 
 In Germany, the rural workers include the following categories who possess land : 1) cottars, cottagers, gardeners [something like our gift-land peasants];2) contract day labourers; they possess land, and hire themselves out for a definite part of the year [cf. 
 our “three-dayers”]. 
 71 “Contract day labourers constitute the bulk of the agricultural labourers in those parts of Germany where big landed property predominates”(p. 
 236); 3) agricultural labourers who do their farming on rentedlabour . 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 It is assumed that at least 75% of the agricultural labourers /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR quite rightly remarks, the cottager “most closely approx-imates to the general type of Russian peasant of the central gubernias” ( Hired Labour , p. 
 495); he is everlastingly compelled to divide his time between seeking employment and cultivating his plot of land. 
 But what is particular-ly interesting to us is the economic position of the farm labourers . 
 The fact is that the landlords themselves find it advantageous to allot them land on account of wages. 
 Here are some examples of the holdings of Ostsee farm labourers:1) 2 dess. 
 of land (we have converted Loftstelle into dessia-tines: 1 Loftstelle =3 dess. 
); the husband works 275 days and the wife 50 days a year at a wage of 25 kopeks per day;2) 2 q dess. 
 of land; “the farm labourer keeps 1 horse, 3 cows, 3 sheep and 2 pigs” (pp. 
 508, 518); the farm labourer works alternate weeks and the wife works 50 days; 3) 6 dess. 
 of land (Bauska Uyezd, Courland Gubernia), “the farm labourer keeps 1 horse, 3 cows, 3 sheep and several pigs”(p. 
 518), he works 3 days a week and his wife 35 days ayear; 4) in Hasenpoth Uyezd, Courland Gubernia—8 dess. 
of land, “in all cases the farm labourers get their flour milled gratis and free medical aid and medicine, and their chil-dren attend school” (p. 
 519), etc. 
 We draw the reader’sattention to the size of the holdings and the scale of the farming of these farm labourers, i. 
e. 
, to the very conditions that, in the opinion of the Narodniks, set our peasants apartfrom the general European agrarian system, which corre-sponds to capitalist production. 
 We combine all the examples given in the publication quoted: 10 farm labourers own 31. 
5dess. 
 of land, that is, an average of 3. 
15 dess. 
 per labourer. 
The farm labourers here include peasants who work the lesser part of the year for the landlord (the husband half the year, and the wife 35 to 50 days) and also one-horse peasants who own 2 and even 3 cows each. 
 The question arises: what constitutes the notorious difference between our “communitypeasant” and the Ostsee farm labourer of this type? In theOstsee region they call things by their proper names, whereasin Russia one-horse farm labourers are combined withwealthy peasants, “averages” are struck, and sentimental talk is indulged in about the “community spirit,” the “labour principle,” “people’s production” and the “combination of agriculture with industries” . 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 6) The intermediary link between these post-Reform types of “peasantry” is the middle peasantry . 
 It is distin-guished by the least development of commodity production. 
 The independent agricultural labour of this category ofpeasant covers his maintenance in perhaps only the bestyears and under particularly favourable conditions, andthat is why his position is an extremely precarious one. 
 Inthe majority of cases the middle peasant cannot make ends meet without resorting to loans, to be repaid by labour-service, etc. 
, without seeking “subsidiary” employment onthe side, which also consists partly in the sale of labour-power, etc. 
 Every crop failure flings masses of the middlepeasants into the ranks of the proletariat. 
 In its socialrelations this group fluctuates between the top group, towards which it gravitates but which only a small minority of lucky ones succeed in entering, and the bottom group, into whichit is pushed by the whole course of social evolution. 
 Wehave seen that the peasant bourgeoisie oust not only the bottom group, but also the middle group, of the peasantry. 
Thus a process specifically characteristic of capitalist econ-omy takes place, the middle members are swept away and the extremes are reinforced—the process of “depeasantising. 
” 7)The differentiation of the peasantry creates a home market for capitalism . 
 In the bottom group, this formation of a market takes place on account of articles of consumption(the market of personal consumption). 
 The rural proletarian, by comparison with the middle peasantry, consumes less , and, moreover, consumes food of worse quality (potatoesinstead of bread, etc. 
), but buys more . 
 The formation and development of a peasant bourgeoisie creates a market intwofold fashion: firstly and mainly on account ofmeans of production (the market of productive consump-tion), since the well-to-do peasant strives to convert into capital those means of production which he “gathers” fromboth landlords “in straitened circumstances” and peasants inthe grip of ruin. 
 Secondly, a market is also created here onaccount of personal consumption, due to the expansion of therequirements of the more affluent peasants. 
 * *Only this fact that a home market is created by the differen-tiation of the peasantry can explain, for example, the enormous growth of the home market for cotton goods, the manufacture of which 8) On the question of whether the differentiation of the peasantry is progressing, and if so at what rate, we have no precise statistics that can be compared with the data in thecombined tables (§§I-VI). 
 This is not surprising, for till now (as we have already remarked) no attempt whatever has been made to study even the statics of the differentia-tion of the peasantry systematically and to indicate the forms in which this process is taking place. 
 * But all the gen-eral data on the economy of our rural districts indicate anuninterrupted and rapidly increasing differentiation: on the one hand, the “peasants” are abandoning and leasing out their land, the number of horseless peasants is growing,the “peasants” are fleeing to the towns, etc. 
; on the other hand, the “progressive trends in peasant farming” are also taking their course, the “peasants” are buying land, improv-ing their farms, introducing iron ploughs, developing grass cultivation, dairy farming, etc. 
 We now know which “peasants” are taking part in these two diametricallyopposite sides of the process. 
 Furthermore, the development of the migration move-ment is giving a tremendous impetus to the differentiationof the peasantry, and especially of the agricultural peas-antry. 
 It is well known that the migration of peasants is mainly from the agricultural gubernias (migration fromthe industrial gubernias is quite negligible), and precisely from the densely populated central gubernias, where there is the greatest development of labour-service (whichretards the differentiation of the peasantry). 
 That is the first point. 
 The second point is that it is mainly the peasants in medium circumstances who are leaving the areas of emi-has grown so rapidly in the post-Reform period along with the wholesale ruin of the peasantry. 
 Mr. 
 N. 
 —on, who illustrates his theories about the home market with this very example of our textile indus-try, was totally unable to explain the existence of this contradictoryphenomenon. 
 *The sole exception is I. 
 Hourwich’s splendid work The Economics of the Russian Village , New York, 1892.

 gration and mainly the extreme groups who are remaining at home. 
 Thus, migration is accelerating the differentiation of the peasantry in the areas of emigration and is carryingthe elements of differentiation to the new places (the agri-cultural wage-labour of settlers in Siberia in the first period of their new life. 
 * This connection between migration and the differentiation of the peasantry is fully proved by I. 
 Hourwich in his superb research work, Peasant Migration to Siberia (Moscow, 1888). 
 We strongly recommend to the reader this book which our Narodnik press has strenuously tried to hush up. 
 ** 9) A tremendous part, as is known, is played in our rural districts by merchant’s and usurer’s capital. 
 We consider it superfluous to cite numerous facts and indicate sources relating to this phenomenon: the facts are well known anddo not directly concern our theme. 
 The only question of interest to us is the following: What relation has merchant’s and usurer’s capital in our countryside to the differentia-tion of the peasantry? Is there any connection between the relations among the various groups of peasants described above and the relations between peasant creditorsand peasant debtors? Is usury a factor and a motive force of differentiation, or does it retard this differentiation? Let us first indicate how theory presents this question. 
 In the analysis of capitalist production given by the author of Capital very great significance was attached, as we know, to merchant’s and usurer’s capital. 
 The main pointsof Marx’s views on this subject are the following: 1) mer-chant’s and usurer’s capital, on the one hand, and industrial capital [i. 
e. 
, capital invested in production,whether agricultural or industrial], on the other, represent a single type of economic phenomenon, which is covered by the general formula: the buying of commodities in order to sell at a profit ( Das Kapital , I, 2. 
 Abschnitt, Chapter IV, especially pp. 
 148-149 of the second German edition 73). 
 2) Merchant’s and usurer’s capital always historically precede *Restriction of migration thus has an enormously retarding effect upon the differentiation of the peasantry. 
 **See also Mr. 
 Preemak’s Material in Figures for a Study of Migration to Siberia . 
 (Note to 2nd edition . 
) the formation of industrial capital and are logically the necessary premise of its formation ( Das Kapital , III, 1, S. 
 312-316; Russ. 
 trans. 
, pp. 
 262-265; III, 2, 132-137,149; Russ. 
 trans. 
, pp. 
 488-492, 502) 74; but in themselves neither merchant’s capital nor usurer’s capital represents asufficient premise for the rise of industrial capital (i. 
e. 
, capitalist production ); they do not always break up the old mode of production and replace it by the capitalist mode of production; the formation of the latter “depends entirely upon the stage of historical development and theattendant circumstances” (ibid. 
, 2, 133; Russ. 
 trans. 
,p. 
 489). 
 75 “To what extent they” (commercial and merchant’s capital) “bring about a dissolution of the old mode of produc-tion depends on their solidity and internal structure. 
 And whither this process of dissolution will lead, in other words, what new mode of production will replace the old, does notdepend on commerce, but on the character of the old mode ofproduction itself” (ibid. 
, III, 1, 316; Russ. 
 trans. 
, 265). 
 76 3) The independent development of merchant’s capital isinversely proportional to the degree of development of capitalist production (ibid. 
, S. 
 312; Russ. 
 trans. 
, 262) 77; the greater the development of merchant’s and usurer’s cap-ital, the smaller the development of industrial capital(=capitalist production ), and vice versa. 
 Consequently, as applied to Russia, the question to be answered is: Is merchant’s and usurer’s capital being linked up with industrial capital? Are commerce and usury, in disintegrating the old mode of production, leading to itsreplacement by the capitalist mode of production, or bysome other system? * These are questions of fact, ques-tions that must be answered in regard to all aspects of *Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
 touched upon this question on the very first page of The Destiny of Capitalism , but neither in this nor in any other of his works did he attempt to examine the facts about the relation between merchant’s and industrial capital in Russia. 
 Mr. 
 N. 
 —on, although claiming to be a faithful follower of Marx’s theory, pre-ferred, however, to replace the precise and clear category “merchant’s hazy term successfully evaded, positively evaded, this question. 
 The predecessor of capitalist production in Russia, according to him, 78isation” or “the capitalisation of income”; and under cover of thiscapital” by the vague and diffuse term of his own coinage—”capital-is not merchant’s capital, but . 
 . 
 . 
 “people’s production. 
 ” the national economy of Russia. 
 As regards peasant culti-vation the data reviewed above contain the reply, and an affirmative reply, to this question. 
 The ordinary Narodnik view that the “kulak” and the “enterprising muzhik” arenot two forms of one and the same economic phenomenon,but totally unconnected and opposite types of phenomena,is absolutely without foundation. 
 It is one of those Narod-nik prejudices which no one has ever even attempted to prove by an analysis of precise economic data. 
 The data indicate the contrary. 
 Whether the peasant hires workersfor the purpose of expanding production, whether he tradesin land (recall the data quoted above on the large scale ofland renting among the rich) or in groceries, or whetherhe trades in hemp, hay, cattle, etc. 
, or money (usurer), he represents a single economic type, and his operations amount, at bottom, to one and the same economic relation. 
Furthermore, that in the Russian community village therole of capital is not confined to bondage and usury, thatcapital is also invested in production, is apparent fromthe fact that the well-to-do peasant puts his money into the improvement of his farm, into the purchase and renting of land, the acquisition of improved implements, thehiring of workers, etc. 
, and not only into trading estab-lishments and undertakings (see above). 
 If capital in ourcountryside were incapable of creating anything but bondageand usury, we could not, from the data on production, establish the differentiation of the peasantry, the formation of a rural bourgeoisie and a rural proletariat; the wholeof the peasantry would represent a fairly even type ofpoverty-stricken cultivators, among whom only usurers wouldstand out, and they only to the extent of money owned andnot to the extent and organisation of agricultural production. 
 Finally, from the above-examined data follows the important proposition that the independent developmentof merchant’s and usurer’s capital in our countryside retards the differentiation of the peasantry. 
 The further the develop-ment of commerce proceeds, bringing the country closer tothe town, eliminating the primitive village markets and undermining the monopoly of the village shopkeeper, and the more there develop forms of credit that accord with Euro-pean standards, displacing the village usurer, the further and deeper must the differentiation of the peasantry proceed. 
 The capital of the well-to-do peasants, forced out of petty trade and usury, will flow more abundantly into production, whither it is already beginning toflow. 
 10) Another important phenomenon in the economy of our countryside that retards the differentiation of the peas-antry is the survivals of corvée economy, i. 
e. 
, labour-service. 
 Labour-service is based on the payment of labour in kind, hence, on a poor development of commodity econ-omy. 
 Labour-service presupposes and requires the middlepeasant, one who is not very affluent (otherwise he wouldnot agree to the bondage of labour-service) but is also nota proletarian (to undertake labour-service one must have one’s own implements, one must be at least in some measure a “sound” peasant). 
 When we said above that the peasant bourgeoisie are the masters of the contemporary countryside, we disregardedthe factors retarding differentiation: bondage, usury,labour-service, etc. 
 Actually, the real masters of the contemporary countryside are often enough not the representa-tives of the peasant bourgeoisie, but the village usurersand the neighbouring landowners. 
 It is, however, quitelegitimate to disregard them, for otherwise it is impossibleto study the internal system of economic relationships amongthe peasantry. 
 It is interesting to note that the Narodnik also employs this procedure, only he stops half-way and does not carry his reasoning to its logical conclusion. 
Speaking of the burden of taxes, etc. 
, in The Destiny of Capitalism , Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
 observes that due to these reasons “the conditions for a natural (sic!) life no longer exist” (287)for the village community, for the “ mir”. 
 Excellent! But the whole question is precisely: what are these “natural conditions” that do not yet exist in our countryside? Toobtain a reply to this question one must study the systemof economic relationships within the village community,lifting away, if one may so express it, the survivals of pre-Reform times which obscure these “natural conditions” of life in our countryside. 
 Had Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
 done this, he would have seen that this system of village relationshipsreveals the absolute differentiation of the peasantry, that the more completely bondage, usury, labour-service, etc. 
, are forced out, the more profoundly will the differentiation of the peasantry proceed. 
 * Above we have shown, on the basis of Zemstvo statistics, that this differentiation is already an accomplished fact, that the peasantry havecompletely split up into opposite groups. 
 *Incidentally. 
 In speaking of Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
’s The Destiny of Capi-talism , and particularly of Chapter VI, from which the quotation is taken, one cannot but indicate that it contains very good and quite fair pages. 
 These are the pages where the author does not deal with the “destiny of capitalism” and not even with capitalism at all, but with the methods of exacting taxes. 
 It is characteristic that Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
does not notice the inseparable connection between these methodsand the survivals of corvée economy, which latter (as we shall see below) he is capable of idealising ! C H A P T E R III79 THE LANDOWNERS’ TRANSITION CORVÉE TO CAPITALIST ECONOMY From peasant economy we must now pass to landlord economy. 
 Our task is to examine, in its main features, thepresent social-economic system of landlord economy and to describe the nature of the evolution of this system in the post-Reform epoch. 
 I. 
 THE MAIN FEATURES OF CORVÉE ECONOMY As our starting-point in examining the present system of landlord economy we must take the system of that econ-omy which prevailed in the epoch of serfdom. 
 The essenceof the economic system of those days was that the entireland of a given unit of agrarian economy, i. 
e. 
, of a givenestate, was divided into the lord’s and the peasants’ land; the latter was distributed in allotments among the peasants, who (receiving other means of production in addition, asfor example, timber, sometimes cattle, etc. 
) cultivatedit with their own labour and their own implements, andobtained their livelihood from it. 
 The product of this peas-ants’ labour constituted the necessary product, to employ the terminology of theoretical political economy; neces-sary—for the peasants in providing them with meansof subsistence, and for the landlord in providing him withhands; in exactly the same way as the product whichreplaces the variable part of the value of capital is a necessaryproduct in capitalist society. 
 The peasants’ surplus labour, on the other hand, consisted in their cultivation, with the same implements, of the landlord’s land; the productof that labour went to the landlord. 
 Hence, the surplus labour was separated then in space from the necessary labour: for the landlord they cultivated his land, for them-selves their allotments; for the landlord they worked some days of the week and for themselves others. 
 The peasant’sallotment in this economy served, as it were, as wages inkind (to express oneself in modern terms), or as a meansof providing the landlord with hands. 
 The peasants’ “own”farming of their allotments was a condition of the land-lord economy, and its purpose was to “provide” not the peasant with means of livelihood but the landlord with hands. 
 * It is this system of economy which we call corvée [Russ. 
: barshchina] economy. 
 Its prevalence obviously presumesthe following necessary conditions: firstly, the predominanceof natural economy. 
 The feudal estate had to constitute a self-sufficing, self-contained entity, in very slight contact with the outside world. 
 The production of grain by the land-lords for sale, which developed particularly in the latterperiod of the existence of serfdom, was already a harbinger ofthe collapse of the old regime. 
 Secondly, such an economyrequired that the direct producer be allotted the means of production in general, and land in particular; moreover, that he be tied to the land, since otherwise the landlordwas not assured of hands. 
 Hence, the methods of obtainingthe surplus product under corvée and under capitalist econ-omy are diametrically opposite: the former is based onthe producer being provided with land, the latter on the producer being dispossessed of the land. 
 ** Thirdly, a *An extremely vivid description of this system of economy is given by A. 
 Engelhardt in his Letters from the Countryside (St. 
 Petersburg 1885, pp. 
 556-557). 
 The author quite rightly points out that feudal economy was a definite, regular and complete system, thedirector of which was the landlord, who allotted land to the peasantsand assigned them to various jobs. 
 **In opposing the view of Henry George, who said that the ex-propriation of the mass of the population is the great and universal cause of poverty and oppression, Engels wrote in 1887: “This is not quite correct historically.... 
 In the Middle Ages, it was not theexpropriation of the people from , but on the contrary, their appropria-tion to the land which became the source of feudal oppression. 
 The peasant retained his land, but was attached to it as a serf or villein,and made liable to tribute to the lord in labour and in produce” ( The Condition of the Working-Class in England in 1844 , New York, 1887, Preface, p. 
 III). 
 80 condition for such a system of economy was the personal dependence of the peasant on the landlord. 
 If the landlord had not possessed direct power over the person of the peasant, he could not have compelled a man who had a plot of landand ran his own farm to work for him. 
 Hence, “other thaneconomic pressure,” as Marx says in describing this economicregime, was necessary (and, as has already been indicatedabove, Marx assigned it to the category of labour-rent ; Das Kapital , III, 2, 324). 
 81 The form and degree of this coercion may be the most varied, ranging from the peasant’sserf status to his lack of rights in the social estates. 
 Fourthly,and finally, a condition and a consequence of the systemof economy described was the extremely low and stagnantcondition of technique, for farming was in the hands of small peasants, crushed by poverty and degraded by perso-nal dependence and by ignorance. 
 II. 
 THE COMBINATION OF THE CORVÉE AND THE CAPITALIST SYSTEMS OF ECONOMY The corvée system of economy was undermined by the abolition of serfdom. 
 All the main foundations of thissystem were undermined: natural economy, the self-contained and the self-sufficient character of the landed estate,the close connection between its various constituents, and the landlord’s power over the peasants. 
 The peasant’s farm was separated from that of the landlord; the peasant wasto buy back his land and become the full owner of it; thelandlord, to adopt the capitalist system of farming, which,as has just been observed, has a diametrically oppositebasis. 
 But such a transition to a totally different system could not, of course, take place at once, and for two differ-ent reasons. 
 First, the conditions required for capitalistproduction did not yet exist. 
 A class of people was requiredwho were accustomed to work for hire; the peasants’ imple-ments had to be replaced by those of the landlord; agricul-ture had to be organised on the same lines as any other commercial and industrial enterprise and not as the business of the lord. 
 All these conditions could onlytake shape gradually, and the attempts of some landlords, immediately after the Reform, to import machinery and even workers from abroad could not but end in a fiasco. 
 The other reason why the transition to the capitalist conduct of affairs was not possible at once was that the oldcorvée system of economy had been undermined, but not yetcompletely destroyed. 
 The peasants’ farms were notentirely separated from those of the landlords, for the latterretained possession of very essential parts of the peasants’ allotments: the “cut-off lands,” 82 the woods, meadows, watering places, pastures, etc. 
 Without these lands (or ease-ment rights) the peasants were absolutely unable to carry onindependent farming, so that the landlords were able tocontinue the old system of economy in the form of labour-service. 
 The possibility of exercising “other than economic pressure” also remained in the shape of the peasants’ temporarily-bound status, 83 collective responsibility, corporal punishment, forced labour on public works, etc. 
 Thus, capitalist economy could not emerge at once, and corvée economy could not disappear at once. 
 The only pos-sible system of economy was, accordingly, a transitional one, a system combining the features of both the corvée and the capitalist systems. 
 And indeed, the post-Reformsystem of farming practised by the landlords bears preciselythese features. 
 With all the endless variety of forms charac-teristic of a transitional epoch, the economic organisationof contemporary landlord farming amounts to two main systems, in the most varied combinations—the labour-service * system and the capitalist system. 
 The first consists in the landlord’s land being cultivated with theimplements of the neighbouring peasants, the form ofpayment not altering the essential nature of this system(whether payment is in money, as in the case of job-hire, or in produce, as in the case of half-cropping, or in land or grounds, as in the case of labour-service in the narrowsense of the term). 
 This is a direct survival of corvéeeconomy, ** and the economic characterisation of the latter, *We are now replacing the term “corvée” by the term “labour-serv-ice” since the latter expression corresponds in greater measure to post-Reform relations and is by now generally accepted in our literature. 
 **Here is a particularly striking example: “In the south of Yelets Uyezd (Orel Gubernia),” writes a correspondent of the Department given above, is applicable almost entirely to the labour-service system (the only exception being that in one of the forms of the labour-service system one of the conditions of corvée economy disappears, namely, under job-hire, where labourinstead of being paid in kind is paid in money). 
 The capital-ist farming system consists of the hire of workers (annual,seasonal, day, etc. 
) who till the land with the owner’simplements. 
 The systems mentioned are actually interwoven in the most varied and fantastic fashion: on a mass of landlord estates there is a combination of the two sys-tems, which are applied to different farming operations. 
 * It is quite natural that the combination of such dissimilarand even opposite systems of economy leads in practice to awhole number of most profound and complicated conflicts and contradictions, and that the pressure of these contra-dictions results in a number of the farmers going bankrupt,etc. 
 All these are phenomena characteristic of every transi-tional period. 
 If we raise the question as to the relative incidence of the two systems, we shall have to say, first of all, that no pre-cise statistics are available on the matter, and it is not likely that they could be collected: that would require a registra-of Agriculture, “on the big landlords’ farms, side by side with culti-vation with the aid of annual labourers, a considerable part of theland is tilled by peasants in return for land leased to them. 
 The ex-serfs continue to rent land from their former landlords, and in return till their land Such villages continue to bear the name of ‘ corvée ’ of such-and-such a landlord” (S. 
 A. 
 Korolenko, Hired Labour , etc. 
, p. 
 118) Here is one more example: “On my farm,” writes another landlord, “all the work is done by my former peasants (8 villageswith approximately 600 persons); in return for this they get the useof pastures for their cattle (from 2,000 to 2,500 dess. 
); except that seasonal workers do the first ploughing and sow with seed drills” (ibid. 
, p. 
 325. 
 From Kaluga Uyezd). 
 *“Most of the estates are managed in the following way: part, although a very small part, of the land is cultivated by the ownerswith their own implements, with the aid of labourers hired by theyear” and other “workers, but all the rest of the land is leased to peas-ants for cultivation either on a half-crop basis” or in return for land, simultaneous resort is made to nearly all, or at any rate many, forms of hire” (i. 
e. 
, methods of “providing the farm with man power”).

 We would add that such a correction would Thus, although the labour-service system predominates in the purely Russian gubernias, the capitalist system of landlord farming must be considered the predominant one at present in European Russia as a whole. 
 Moreover, ourtable gives a far from complete picture of this predominance,for Group I of the gubernias includes some in which thelabour-service system is not applied at all (the Balticgubernias, for example), whereas Group III includes not a single gubernia, and in all probability not a single farmed estate in which the capitalist system is not applied at leastin part.

5 Lastly, it must be observed that sometimes the labour-service system passes into the capitalist system and merges with it to such an extent that it becomes almost impos-sible to distinguish one from the other. 
 For example, apeasant rents a plot of land, undertaking in return to performa definite number of days’ work (a practice which, as weknow, is most widespread; see examples in the next section). 
 How are we to draw a line of demarcation between such a “peasant” and the West-European or Ostsee “farm labourer”who receives a plot of land on undertaking to work adefinite number of days? Life creates forms that unitein themselves with remarkable gradualness systems of econ-omy whose basic features constitute opposites. 
 It becomes impossible to say where “labour-service” ends and where “capitalism” begins. 
 hardly alter our conclusion as to the predominance of the capitalist system, since a large part of the landowners’ fields in the black-earthbelt is rented, and the labour-service system predominates in thegubernias of this belt. 
 Having established the fundamental fact that the whole variety of forms of contemporary landlord farming amounts to two systems—the labour-service and the cap-italist systems, in various combinations, we shall nowproceed to give an economic description of the two systemsand determine which of them is eliminating the other underthe influence of the whole course of economic evolution. 
 III. 
 DESCRIPTION OF THE LABOUR-SERVICE SYSTEM Labour-service, as has already been observed above, is of exceedingly varied types. 
 Sometimes peasants under-take for a money payment to cultivate with their own implements the fields of the landowner—so-called “job-hire,” “dessiatine employments,” * cultivation of “cycles” **85 (i. 
e. 
, one dessiatine of spring crop and one of winter crop),etc. 
 Sometimes the peasant borrows grain or money, under-taking to work off either the entire loan or the intereston it. 
 *** Under this form a feature peculiar to the labour-service system in general stands out with great clarity— the bondage, the usurious character of this sort of hire oflabour. 
 In some cases the peasants work “for trespass”(i. 
e. 
, undertake to work off the legally established finefor cattle trespass), or work simply “out of respect” (cf. 
Engelhardt, loc. 
 cit. 
, 56), i. 
e. 
, gratis, or just for a drink, so as not to lose other “employments” by the landowner. 
 Last-ly, labour-service in return for land is very widespread inthe shape either of half-cropping or directly of work forland rented, for grounds used, etc. 
 Very often the payment for rented land assumes the most diverse forms, which sometimes are even combined, so that side by side with money rent we find rent in kind and “labour-service. 
” Here are a couple of examples: forevery dessiatine, 1 2 dess. 
 to be cultivated #10 eggs # *Statistical Returns for Ryazan Gubernia . 
 **Engelhardt, loc. 
 cit. 
 *** Statistical Returns for Moscow Gubernia , Vol. 
 V, Pt. 
 I, Moscow, 1879, pp, 186-189. 
 We give these references only as an illus-tration. 
 A mass of similar information is to be found in all the literature on peasant and private-landowner farming. 
 1 chicken #1 day’s female labour; for 43 dess. 
 of spring-crop land 12 rubles per dess. 
, and 51 dess.

 in cash #threshing of so many stacks of oats, 7 stacks of buckwheat and 20 stacks of rye #manur-ing of not less than 5 dessiatines of rented land with manurefrom own animals, at the rate of 300 cart-loads per dessia-tine (Karyshev, Rentings , p. 
 348). 
 In this case even the peasant’s manure is converted into a constituent part of the private landowner’s farm! The widespread and varied character of labour-service is indicated by the abundanceof terms used for it: otrabotki, otbuchi, otbutki, barshchina,basarinka, posobka, panshchina, postupok, viyemka, etc. 
(ibid. 
, 342). 
 Sometimes the peasant pledges himself to per-form “whatever work the owner orders” (ibid. 
, 346), or in general to “pay heed,” “give ear” to him, to “help out. 
” Labour-service embraces the “whole cycle of jobs in rurallife. 
 It is as labour-service that all operations relating tofield-cultivation and grain and hay harvesting get done,firewood is stocked and loads are carted” (346-347), roofs andchimneys are repaired (354, 348), and the delivery of poultry and eggs is undertaken (ibid. 
). 
 An investigator of Gdov Uyezd, St. 
 Petersburg Gubernia, quite justly remarks thatthe types of labour-service to be met with are of the “former,pre-Reform, corvée character” (349). 
 * Particularly interesting is the form of labour-service for land, so-called labour-service renting and rent pay-ment in kind. 
 ** In the preceding chapter we have seen how capitalist relations are manifested in peasant renting ofland; here we see “renting” which is simply a survival of *It is noteworthy that the enormous variety of forms of labour-service in Russia, and of forms of land renting with all sorts of supple-mentary payments, etc. 
, are covered in their entirety by the main forms of pre-capitalist relations in agriculture indicated by Marxin Chapter 47, Vol. 
 III of Capital . 
 In the preceding chapter, we have indicated that there are three main forms: 1) labour-rent, 2) rent inkind, and 3) money rent. 
 It is, therefore quite natural that Marx should want specifically Russian data as illustrations for the section dealing with ground-rent. 
 **According to Results of Zemstvo Statistical Investigations (Vol II), of all the land rented by peasants, 76% is paid for in money;3 to 7% by labour-service, 13 to 17% with part of the product and,finally, 2 to 3% by a combination of methods. 
 corvée economy, * and which sometimes passes impercep-tibly into the capitalist system of providing the estate with agricultural workers by alloting patches of land to them. 
 Zemstvo statistics establish beyond doubt this connectionbetween such “renting” and the lessors’ own farming. 
 “Withthe development of their own farming on the private land-owners’ estates, the owners had to guarantee themselves a supply of workers at the required time . 
 Hence, there develops in many places the tendency among them to dis-tribute land to the peasants on the labour-service basis, orfor a part of the crop together with labour-service. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
”This system of farming “. 
 . 
 . 
 is fairly widespread. 
 The morefrequently the lessors do their own farming, the smaller theamount of land available for leasing and the greater the demand for such land, the more widely does this form of land renting develop” (ibid. 
, p. 
 266, cf. 
 also 367). 
 Thus,we have here renting of a very special kind, under which thelandowner does not abandon his own farm, but whichexpresses the development of private-landowner cultivation , expresses not the consolidation of the peasant farm by the enlargement of area held, but the conversion of the peasant into an agricultural labourer . 
 In the preceding chapter we have seen that on the peasant’s farm the renting of land is ofcontradictory significance: for some it is a profitableexpansion of their farms; for others it is a deal made out ofdire need. 
 Now we see that on the landlord’s farm, too, the leasing of land is of contradictory significance: in some cases it is the transfer of the farm to another person for a paymentof rent; in others it is a method of conducting one’s ownfarm, a method of providing one’s estate with manpower. 
 Let us pass to the question of the payment of labour under labour-service. 
 The data from various sources are at one in testifying to the fact that the payment of labour where it is hired on a labour-service and bonded basis is alwayslower than under capitalist “free” hire. 
 Firstly, this is proved by the fact that rent in kind, i. 
e. 
, on the basis oflabour-service and half-cropping (which, as we have just *Cf. 
 examples given in footnote to pp. 
 194-195. 
 When corvée economy existed, the landlord gave the peasant land so that the peasantmight work for him. 
 When land is leased on the labour-servicebasis, the economic aspect of the matter is obviously the same. 
 seen, is merely labour-service and bonded hire), is every-where, as a general rule, more costly than money rent, very much more costly (ibid. 
, p. 
 350), sometimes twice as much (ibid. 
, 356, Rzhev Uyezd, Tver Gubernia). 
 Secondly, rentin kind is developed to the greatest degree among the poor-est groups of peasants (ibid. 
, 261 and foll. 
). 
 This is rentingfrom dire need, “renting” by the peasant who is no longerable to resist his conversion, in this way, into an agricul-tural wage-worker. 
 The well-to-do peasants do what they can to rent land for money. 
 “The tenant takes advantageof every opportunity to pay his rent in money, and thusto reduce the cost of using other people’s land” (ibid. 
,265)—and we would add, not only to reduce the cost ofrenting the land, but also to escape bonded hire. 
 In Rostov-on-Don Uyezd the remarkable fact was even observed of money rent being abandoned in favour of skopshchina, 86 as rents went up, despite a drop in the peasants’ share of the harvest (ibid. 
, p. 
 266). 
 The significance of rent in kind, which utterly ruins the peasant and turns him into a farmlabourer, is quite clearly illustrated by this fact. 
 * Thirdly, *The summary of the latest data on land renting (Mr. 
 Karyshev in the book: The Influence of Harvests , etc. 
, Vol 1) has fully confirmed the fact that it is only want that compels peasants to rent land on a half-crop or a labour-service basis, and that the well-to-do peasantsprefer to rent land for money (pp. 
 317-320), as rent in kind is every-where incomparably more costly for the peasant than in cash (pp. 
 342-346). 
 All these facts, however, have not prevented Mr. 
 Karyshevfrom presenting the situation as though “the poor peasant ... is better able to satisfy his need for food by slightly extending his crop area to other people’s land on a half-crop basis” (321). 
 Such are the fantas-tic ideas to which a bias in favour of “natural economy” can lead one! It has been proved that the payment of rent in kind is more costly than payment in cash, that it constitutes a sort of truck-system inagriculture, that the peasant is completely ruined and turned into a farm labourer—and yet our economist talks of improving “food”! Half-crop payment for rent, if you please, “helps ... the needy sectionof the rural population to obtain” land by renting it (320). 
 Our economist here calls it “help” to obtain land on the worst conditions, on the condition that the peasant is turned into a farm labourer. 
 Thequestion arises: what is the difference between the Russian Narodniks and the Russian agrarians, who always have been and always are ready to render the “needy section of the rural population” this kind of “help”? By the way, here is an interesting example. 
 In KhotinUyezd, Bessarabia Gubernia, the average daily earnings of a half-cropper are estimated at 60 kopeks, and a day labourer in the summer a direct comparison between the price of labour in the case of labour-service hire and of capitalist “free” hire shows the latter to be greater. 
 In the above-quoted publication of the Department of Agriculture, Hired Labour , etc. 
, it is calculated that the average pay for the complete cul-tivation, with the peasant’s own implements, of a dessia-tine of land under winter grain is 6 rubles (data for the cen-tral black-earth belt for the 8 years, 1883-1891). 
 If, however, we calculate the cost of the same amount of work on a hired labour basis, we get 6 rubles 19 kopeks for the work of thelabourer alone, not counting the work of the horse (the payfor the horse’s work cannot be put at less than 4 rubles50 kopeks, loc. 
 cit. 
, 45). 
 The compiler rightly considersthis to be “absolutely abnormal” (ibid. 
). 
 We would merely observe that the fact that payment for labour under purely capitalist hire is greater than under all forms of bondageand under other pre-capitalist relations has been estab-lished not only in agriculture, but also in industry, and notonly in Russia, but also in other countries. 
 Here are moreprecise and more detailed Zemstvo statistics on this question ( Statistical Returns for Saratov Uyezd , Vol. 
 I, Pt. 
 III, pp. 
 18-19. 
 Quoted from Mr. 
 Karyshev’s Rentings , p. 
 353). 
 (See Table on p. 
 203. 
) Thus, under labour-service (just as under bonded hire combined with usury) the prices paid for labour are usuallyless than half those under capitalist hire. 
 * Since labour at 35 to 50 kopeks. 
 “It seems that the earnings of a half-cropper are , after all , higher than the wages of a farm labourer ” (344; Mr. 
 Karyshev’s italics). 
 This “after all” is very characteristic. 
 But, unlike the farmlabourer, the half-cropper has his farm expenses, has he not? He hasto have a horse and harness, has he not? Why was no account takenof these expenses? Whereas the average daily wage in the summerin Bessarabia Gubernia is 40 to 77 kopeks (1883-1887 and 1888-1892), the average wage of a labourer with horse and harness is 124 to 180 kopeks (1883-1887 and 1888-1892). 
 Does it not rather “seem” thatthe farm labourer “after all” earns more than the half-cropper? Theaverage daily wage of a labourer working without a horse of his own(average for a whole year) is estimated at 67 kopeks for BessarabiaGubernia in the period 1882-1891 (ibid. 
, 178). 
 * After this, what can one do but describe as reactionary the criticism of capitalism made, for instance, by a Narodnik like PrinceVasilchikov? The very word “hired,” he exclaims pathetically, iscontradictory, for hire presupposes non-independence, and non-Saratov Uyezd Average prices (in rubles) paid for cultivating one dessiatine Category of work Under win-Under labour-service Hired labour, ac-ter contract, for the rent of arable cording to state-80 to 100% ments of: of wagesaccording according being to written to state-hirers hired advanced termsments of tenants Complete cultivation and harvesting, with carting and threshing 9.

 0 service can only be undertaken by a local peasant, and one who must be “provided with an allotment,” the fact of the tremendous drop in pay clearly indicates the importance of the allotment as wages in kind. 
 The allotment, in suchcases, continues to this day to serve as a means of “guaran-teeing” the landowner a supply of cheap labour. 
 But thedifference between free and “semi-free” * labour is far from exhausted by the difference in pay. 
 Of enormous importance also is the circumstance that the latter form of labour always presupposes the personal dependence of the onehired upon the one who hires him, it always presupposesthe greater or lesser retention of “other than economic pres-sure. 
” Engelhardt very aptly says that the lending of moneyfor repayment by labour-service is explained by the greater security of such debts: to extract payment from the peasant on a distraint order is a difficult matter, “but theauthorities will compel the peasant to perform the work he independence rules out “freedom. 
” This Narodnik-minded landlord forgets, of course, that capitalism substitutes free non-independence for bonded non-independence. 
*An expression employed by Mr. 
 Karyshev, loc. 
 cit. 
 It is a pity Mr. 
 Karyshev did not draw the conclusion that half-crop renting“helps” the survival of “semi-free” labour! has undertaken to do, even if his own grain remains ungath-ered” (loc. 
 cit. 
, 216). 
 “Only long years of slavery, of serf labour for the lord, have been able to produce the indiffer-ence” (only apparent) with which the cultivator leaveshis own grain in the rain to go carting somebody else’ssheaves (ibid. 
, 429). 
 Without one or other form of bindingthe population to their domiciles, to the “community,” with-out a certain lack of civic rights, labour-service as a system would be impossible. 
 It stands to reason that an inevitable consequence of the above-described features of the labour-service system is low productivity of labour: methods offarming based on labour-service can only be the moststereotyped; the labour of the bonded peasant cannot butapproximate, in quality, to the labour of the serf. 
 The combination of the labour-service and the capital-ist systems makes the present system of landlord farmingextremely similar in its economic organisation to thesystem that prevailed in our textile industry before thedevelopment of large-scale machine industry. 
 There, partof the operations was done by the merchant with his own implements and with wage-workers (fixing the yarn, dyeing and finishing the fabric, etc. 
), and part with the imple-ments of peasant handicraftsmen who worked for him, usinghis material. 
 Here, part of the operations is performed bywage-workers, using the employer’s implements, andanother part by the labour and the implements of peasants working on the land of others. 
 There, combined with industrial capital was merchant’s capital, and the handicrafts-man, besides being weighed down by capital, was burdenedwith bondage, the operations of the subcontractor, the truck-system, etc. 
 Here, likewise, combined with industrial capi-tal is merchant’s and usurer’s capital accompanied by all forms of pay reduction and intensification of the producer’s personal dependence. 
 There, the transitional system lastedfor centuries, being based on a primitive hand-labour tech-nique, and was smashed in some three decades by large-scalemachine industry; here, labour-service has continued almostsince the rise of Rus (the landowners forced the villeins into bondage as far back as the time of Russkaya Pravda 87), per-petuating routine technique, and has begun rapidly to giveway to capitalism only in the post-Reform epoch. 
 In both cases, the old system merely implies stagnation in the forms of production (and, consequently, in all social relations), and the domination of the Asiatic way of life. 
 In both cases, the new, capitalist forms of economy constituteenormous progress, despite all the contradictions inherentin them. 
 IV. 
 THE DECLINE OF THE LABOUR-SERVICE SYSTEM The question now arises: in what relation does the labour-service system stand to the post-Reform economy ofRussia? First of all, the growth of commodity economy conflicts with the labour-service system, since the latter is based on natural economy, on unchanging technique, on inseparable ties between the landlord and the peasant. 
 That is why thissystem is totally impracticable in its complete form, andevery advance in the development of commodity economyand commercial agriculture undermines the conditions ofits practicability. 
 Next we must take account of the following circumstance. 
 From the foregoing it follows that labour-service, as prac-tised in present-day landlord farming, should be dividedinto two types: 1) labour-service that can only be per-formed by a peasant farmer who owns draught animals andimplements (e. 
g. 
, cultivation of “cycle dessiatine,” plough-ing, etc. 
), and 2) labour-service that can be performed by a rural proletarian who has no implements (for example,reaping, mowing, threshing, etc. 
). 
 It is obvious that forboth peasant and landlord farming, the first and the secondtype of labour-service are of opposite significance, and thatthe latter type constitutes a direct transition to capitalism, merging with it by a number of quite imperceptible transi-tions. 
 In our literature labour-service is usually referredto in general, without this distinction being made. 
 Yet inthe process of the elimination of labour-service by capitalismthe shifting of the centre of gravity from the first type oflabour-service to the second is of enormous importance. 
 Here is an example from Statistical Returns for Moscow Gubernia : “On the majority of the estates . 
 . 
 . 
 the cultivation of the fields and the crops, i. 
e. 
, the jobs on the careful fulfilment of which the harvest depends, are done by reg-ular workers, whereas the harvesting, i. 
e. 
, the job in the performance of which promptness and speed are the prime consideration, is given to neighbouring peasants to be donein return for money lent, or for the use of pasture and othergrounds” (Vol. 
 V, Pt. 
 2, p. 
 140). 
 On such farms most ofthe hands are hired on the labour-service basis, but thecapitalist system undoubtedly predominates, and the “neigh-bouring peasants” are at bottom turned into rural workers, similar to the “contract day labourers” in Germany, who also have land and also hire themselves out for a definite part of the year (see above, p. 
 179, footnote). 
 The enormousdrop in the number of horses owned by peasants and the increase in the number of horseless households as a result of the crop failures of the 90s * could not but exert great influence in accelerating this process of the elimination of labour-service by the capitalist system. 
 ** Finally, one of the most important reasons for the decline of the labour-service system should be sought in the *The horse census of 1893-1894 in 48 gubernias revealed a drop of 9. 
6% in the number of horses possessed by all horse owners, and adrop of 28,321 in the number of horse owners. 
 In Tambov, Voronezh,Kursk, Ryazan, Orel, Tula and Nizhni-Novgorod gubernias, thedecline in the number of horses between 1888 and 1893 was 21. 
2%. 
In seven other gubernias of the black-earth belt the decline between1891 and 1893 was 17%. 
 In 38 gubernias of European Russia in 1888-1891 there were 7,922 260 peasant households, of which 5,736,436owned horses; in 1893-1894, there were in these gubernias 8,288,987households, of which 5,647,233 owned horses. 
 Consequently, thenumber of horse-owning households dropped by 89,000, while thenumber of horseless increased by 456,000 The percentage of horse-less households rose from 27. 
6% to 31. 
9% ( Statistics of the Russian Empire , XXXVII. 
 St. 
 Petersburg, 1896. 
) Above we have shown that in 48 gubernias of European Russia the number of horseless house-holds rose from 2. 
8 million in 1888-1891 to 3. 
2 million in 1896-1900—i. 
e. 
, from 27. 
3% to 29. 
2%. 
 In four southern gubernias (Bessarabia,Ekaterinoslav, Taurida, Kherson), the number of horseless house-holds rose from 305,800 in 1896 to 341,600 in 1904, i.

 differentiation of the peasantry. 
 The connection between labour-service (of the first type) and the middle group of the peasantry is clear and a priori—as we have already observed above—and can be proved by Zemstvo statistics. 
 Forexample, the abstract for Zadonsk Uyezd, Voronezh Guber-nia, gives returns of the number of farms doing job-work, inthe various groups of peasantry.

3 100 100 From the above it is clear that participation in job-work is less prevalent in the two extreme groups. 
 The largestpercentage of households taking job-work is to be found inthe middle group of the peasantry. 
 Since job-work is also frequently assigned in Zemstvo statistical abstracts to the category of “employments” in general, we see here, con-sequently, an example of the typical “employments” ofthe middle peasantry—exactly as in the preceding chapterwe acquainted ourselves with the typical “employments”of the bottom and top groups of the peasantry. 
 The types of “employments” examined there express the development of capitalism (commercial and industrial establishments andthe sale of labour-power), whereas the type of “employments”mentioned here, on the contrary, expresses the backward-ness of capitalism and the predominance of labour-service(if we assume that in the sum-total of “job-work” the predom-inant jobs are such as we have assigned to labour-service of the first type). 
 The greater the decline of natural economy and of the middle peasantry, the more vigorously is labour-servicebound to be eliminated by capitalism. 
 The well-to-do peas-ants cannot, naturally, serve as a basis for the labour-service system, for it is only dire need that compels the peasant to undertake the worst-paid jobs, jobs that are ruinous forhis own farm. 
 But the rural proletariat are equally unsuitable for the labour-service system, though for another reason: having no farm of his own, or possessing a miser-able patch of land, the rural proletarian is not tied down to it to the extent that the “middle” peasant is, and, as aconsequence, it is far easier for him to go elsewhere and hirehimself out on “free” terms, i. 
e. 
, for higher pay and withoutbondage at all. 
 Hence the universal dissatisfaction of ouragrarians at the peasants leaving for the towns or for “out-side employments” generally, hence their complaints that the peasants have “little attachment” (see below, p. 
 250). 
The development of purely capitalist wage-labour saps thevery roots of the labour-service system. 
 * *Here is a particularly striking example. 
 Zemstvo statisticians explain the comparative incidence of money renting and renting in kind in various parts of Bakhmut Uyezd, Ekaterinoslav Gubernia,in the following way: “Money renting is most widespread ... in the coal and salt-mining districts, and least widespread in the steppe and purely agriculturalarea The peasants, in general, are not eager to go out to work for others, and are particularly reluctant to accept irksome and badly-paid work on private estates. 
 Work in the coal mines, in ore-miningand in metallurgy generally, is arduous and injurious to the worker’s health, but, generally speaking, it is better paid, and attracts the worker with the prospect of monthly or weekly wages in cash, as hedoes not usually get money when he works on the landlord’s estate, for the reason that there he is either working in payment of the ‘bit’ of land he has rented, or of straw or grain he has borrowed, or hasmanaged to get his pay in advance to cover his ordinary needs, etc. 
 “All this induces the worker to avoid working on estates, and he does avoid doing so when there is an opportunity of earning moneyin some place other than the landlord’s ‘estate. 
’ And this opportunity occurs mostly where there are many mines, at which the workers are paid ‘good’ money. 
 With the ‘pence’ the peasant earns in the mines,he can rent land, without having to pledge himself to work on an estate, and in this way renting for money establishes its sway” (quoted from Results of Zemstvo Statistical Investigations , Vol. 
 II, p. 
 265). 
 In the steppe, non-industrial divisions of the uyezd, on the other hand, land renting on a skopshchina and a labour-service basis establishes its sway. 
 Thus, to escape labour-service the peasant is ready to flee even to the mines! Prompt payment in cash, the impersonal form of hire and regular working hours “attract” the worker to such an extent thathe even prefers the mines underground to agriculture, the agriculture about which our Narodniks wax so idyllic. 
 The whole point is that the peasant knows from bitter experience the real value of the labour-service idealised by the agrarians and the Narodniks, and he knows how much better are purely capitalist relations. 
 It is supremely important to note that this inseparable connection between the differentiation of the peasantry and the elimination of labour-service by capitalism—a connec-tion so obvious in theory—has long been noted by agricul-tural writers who have observed the various methods offarming on the landlord estates. 
 In the preface to hiscollection of articles on Russian agriculture writtenbetween 1857 and 1882, Prof. 
 Stebut points out that . 
 . 
 . 
 “In community peasant agriculture the farmer-industrialists are becoming differentiated from the farm labourers . 
 The former, who are becoming cultivators on a big scale, are beginning toemploy farm labourers and usually cease to take job-work, unless they find it absolutely necessary to enlarge their crop area somewhat, or to obtain the use of pasture land, which in most cases cannot be done except by taking job-work; the latter, on the other hand, cannot take any job-work for lack of horses. 
 Hence the obvious necessity for a transition , and a speedy transition , to farming based on wage-labour , since the peasants who still take job-work by the dessiatine are, due to the feeble state of their horses and to the multitude of jobs they undertake, beginning to turnout work that is bad from the viewpoint both of quality and of promptness of fulfilment” (p. 
 20). 
 References to the fact that the ruin of the peasantry is leading to the elimination of labour-service by capitalism are also made in current Zemstvo statistical material. 
 In Orel Gubernia, for example, it has been observed that the drop in grain prices ruined many tenants and that the land-owners were compelled to increase the area cultivated on capitalist lines. 
 “Simultaneously with the expansion of the area cultivated by the landlords, we observe everywhere a tendency to replace job-work by the labour of regular farm-hands and to do away with the use of peasants’ implements . 
 . 
 . 
 a tendency to improve the cultivation of the soil by the intro-duction of up-to-date implements . 
 . 
 . 
 to change the system of farming, to introduce grass crops, to expand and improve livestock farming and to make it profitable” ( Agricultural Survey of Orel Gubernia for 1887-88 , pp. 
 124-126. 
 Quoted from P. 
 Struve’s Critical Remarks , pp. 
 242-244). 
 In Poltava Gubernia, in 1890, when grain prices were low, there was observed “a diminution in peasant renting of land . 
 . 
 . 
 through-the severe drop in grain prices, there was an increase in the area cultivated by landowners employing regular labour” (The Influence of Harvests , etc. 
, I, 304). 
 In Tambov Guber-nia, a considerable increase has been observed in the pricespaid for work done by horses: for the three years 1892-1894, these prices were 25 to 30% higher than for the threeyears 1889-1891 ( Novoye Slovo , 1895, No. 
 3, p. 
 187). 
 This rise in the cost of work done by horses, a natural result ofthe decline in the number of peasant horses, cannot butentail the ousting of labour-service by the capitalist system. 
 It is by no means our intention, of course, to use these sep-arate references in order to prove that labour-service is beingeliminated by capitalism: no complete statistics on this subject are available. 
 We are merely using them to illus-trate the point that there is a connection between the differen-tiation of the peasantry and the elimination of labour-serviceby capitalism. 
 General and mass-scale data, which prove irre-futably that this elimination is going on, relate to the employ-ment of machinery in agriculture and to the employment of labour freely hired. 
 But before passing to these data, we must first deal with the views of the Narodnik economists oncontemporary farming by private landowners in Russia. 
 V. 
 THE NARODNIK ATTITUDE TO THE PROBLEM The point that the labour-service system is simply a survival of corvée economy is not denied even by theNarodniks. 
 On the contrary, it is admitted—although in aninsufficiently general form—by Mr. 
 N. 
 —on ( Sketches , §IX) and by Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
 (particularly explicitly in his article “Our Peasant Farming and Agronomy,” in Otechestvenniye Zapiski , 1882, No. 
 8-9). 
 The more astonishing is it that the Narodniks do their utmost to avoid admitting the clear and simple fact that the present system of private-landownerfarming is a combination of the labour-service and the capi-talist systems, and that, consequently, the more developed the former, the weaker the latter, and vice versa. 
 They avoid analysing the relation of each of these systems to the prod-uctivity of labour, to the payment of the worker’s labour,out the guberni a. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 Correspondingly, in many places, despite /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR to the basic features of the post-Reform economy of Russia, etc. 
 To put the question on this basis, on the basis of recognising the “ change ” actually taking place , meant to admit the inevitability of the progressive elimination of labour-service by capitalism. 
 To avoid drawing that conclusion,the Narodniks did not stop even at idealising the labour-service system . 
 This monstrous idealisation is the basic feature of the Narodnik views on the evolution of landlord economy. 
 Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
 even went so far as to write that “the people . 
 . 
 . 
 are the victors in the struggle for the form of agri-cultural technique, although their victory has resultedin their greater ruin” ( The Destiny of Capitalism , p. 
 288). 
 To admit such a “victory” is more eloquent than to admit defeat! Mr. 
 N. 
 —on discerned in the allotment of land to the peasants under corvée and under labour-service economy the “principle” “of linking the producer and the means ofproduction,” but he forgot the tiny circumstance that thisallotting of land served as a means of guaranteeing a supplyof labour for the landlords. 
 As we have indicated, Marx, indescribing pre-capitalist systems of agriculture, analysed all the forms of economic relations that, in general, exist in Russia, and clearly emphasised the necessity of small-scaleproduction and of a tie between the peasant and the land inthe case of both labour-rent, rent in kind and money rent. 
But could it ever have entered his head to elevate thisallotting of land to the dependent peasant into a “prin-ciple” of an eternal tie between the producer and the means of production? Did he forget even for a moment that this tie between the producer and the means of production wasthe source of, and condition for, medieval exploitation, con-stituted the basis for technical and social stagnation andnecessarily required all sorts of “other than economic, pres-sure”? An exactly similar idealisation of labour-service and of bondage is displayed by Messrs. 
 Orlov and Kablukov inMoscow Zemstvo Returns when they quote as a model the farm of a certain Mme. 
 Kostinskaya in Podolsk Uyezd (seeVol. 
 V, Pt. 
 I, pp. 
 175-176, and Vol. 
 II, pp. 
 59-62, Sect. 
 II). 
 In Mr. 
 Kablukov’s opinion, this farm proves “that it is possible to arrange matters in such a way as to preclude(sic!!) such an antagonism” (i. 
e. 
, antagonism of interests between landlord and peasant farming) “and assist in achiev-ing a flourishing (sic!) condition of both peasant and private farming” (Vol. 
 V, Pt. 
 I, pp. 
 175-176). 
 It seems, then, that the flourishing condition of the peasants consists in . 
 . 
 . 
labour-service and bondage. 
 They have no pastures or cattle-runs (Vol. 
 II, pp. 
 60-61),—which does not prevent Messrs. 
 the Narodniks from regarding them as “sound” peas-ants—and rent these grounds, for which they pay the proprietress in work , performing “all the jobs on her estate . 
 . 
 . 
 thoroughly, punctually and promptly. 
” * That is the limit in idealising an economic system which is a direct survival of corvée service! The methods employed in all such Narodnik reasoning are very simple; we have only to forget that the allotment of land to the peasant is one of the conditions of corvée or labour-service economy, we have only to omit the circum-stance that this allegedly “independent” cultivator must renderlabour-rent, rent in kind or money rent,—and we get the“pure” idea of “the tie between the producer and the means ofproduction. 
” But the actual relation between capitalism and pre-capitalist forms of exploitation does not change in the least from the fact of simply omitting these forms. 
 ** *Cf. 
 Volgin, op. 
 cit. 
, pp. 
 280-281. 
 **“It is said that the spread of labour-service renting in place of money renting ... is a retrogressive fact. 
 But do we say that it isdesirable or beneficial? We ... have never asserted that it is progres-sive,” stated Mr. 
 Chuprov on behalf of all the authors of The Influ-ence of Harvests , etc. 
 (see Verbatim Report of the Debates in the F. 
 E. 
 S. 
 of March 1 and 2, 1897, 88 p. 
 38) This statement is untrue even formally, for Mr. 
 Karyshev (see above) described labour-serviceas “help” to the rural population. 
 And in substance this statementabsolutely contradicts the actual content of all the Narodnik theorieswith their idealisation of labour-service. 
 It is to the great credit ofMessrs. 
 T. 
-Baranovsky and Struve that they have correctly presented the question (1897) of the significance of low grain prices: the criterion for appraising them must be whether such prices promote the elimi-nation of labour-service by capitalism or not. 
 Such a question isobviously one of fact, and in answering it we differ somewhat from thewriters mentioned. 
 On the basis of the data given in the text (seeparticularly §VII of this chapter and also Chapter IV), we consider it possible and even probable that the period of low grain prices will be marked by a no less, if not more, rapid elimination of labour-service by capitalism than was the preceding historical period of highgrain prices. 
 Let us deal somewhat with another, very curious, argu-ment of Mr. 
 Kablukov. 
 We have seen that he idealises labour-service; but it is remarkable that when he, as a statisti-cian, describes real types of purely capitalist farms in Moscow Gubernia, his description, in spite of himself, and in adistorted way, is a reflection of the very facts that prove theprogressive nature of capitalism in Russian agriculture. 
 Webeg the reader’s attention, and apologise in advance for our rather lengthy quotations. 
 Besides the old types of farms employing hired labour, there is to be found in Moscow Gubernia “a new, recent, emergent type of farm that has totally broken with all tradition and regards things simply, in the way people regard every industry that is to serve as a source of income. 
 Agriculture in this case is not regarded as ... a lord’s hobby, as an occupation anybody may engage in. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 No, here the necessity is recognised of having ... special knowledge.... 
 The basis of calculation” (as to the organisation of production) “is the same as in all other forms of production” ( Statistical Returns for Moscow Gubernia , Vol. 
 V, Pt. 
 I, pp. 
 185-186). 
 Mr. 
 Kablukov does not notice that this description of the new type of farm which has only “recently emerged,” in the 70s, proves precisely the progressive nature of capital-ism in agriculture. 
 It was capitalism that first turnedagriculture from a “lord’s hobby” into ordinary industry, it was capitalism that first compelled people “to regard things simply,” “to break with tradition” and to equip themselveswith “special knowledge. 
” Before capitalism this was both unnecessary and impossible, because the farms of the different manors, village communities and peasant families were “self-sufficing,” were not dependent on other farms, and no power on earth could drag them out of their age-long stagnation. 
 Capitalism was the force which created (through the mediumof the market) the social accounting of the output of the individual producers, and compelled them to reckon with the demands of social development. 
 It is this that constitutesthe progressive role of capitalism in agriculture in all Euro-pean countries. 
 Listen now to the way Mr. 
 Kablukov describes our purely capitalist farms: “Only then is account taken of labour-power as a necessary factor in acting upon nature; without this factor all organisation of the landlord’s estate will be fruitless. 
 Thus, with all appreciation of its significance, this element, at the same time, is not regarded as anindependent source of income, as was the case under serfdom, or as is the case now in those instances when what is made the basis of the estate’s profitability is not the product of labour, the obtaining ofwhich is the direct purpose of its application, not the striving to apply this labour to the production of its more valuable products and thereby to enjoy its results, but the striving to reduce the shareof the product which the worker gets for himself, the desire to reduce the cost of labour to the master as near as possible to zero” (p. 
 186). 
 Reference is made to farming based on labour in return for the useof cut-off lands. 
 “Under these circumstances, for a farm to be profitable the owner requires neither knowledge nor special qualities. 
 All that is obtained from this labour represents clear income for the owner,or at all events such income as is obtained almost without any expenditure of circulating capital. 
 But such farming cannot, of course, be well conducted and cannot be called farming in the strict senseof the term, any more than the leasing of all pasture and other grounds can be called such; there is no economic organisation here” (186). 
 And quoting examples of the leasing of cut-off lands in return forlabour-service, the author concludes: “The main emphasis in the farm economy, the manner of extracting an income from the soil, is rooted in the exertion of influence upon the worker rather than upon matterand its forces” (189). 
 This argument is an extremely interesting example of how distorted is the picture of actual facts when viewed fromthe angle of a wrong theory. 
 Mr. 
 Kablukov confuses produc-tion with the social system of production. 
 Under everysocial system production consists in “the exertion of influ-ence” upon matter and its forces. 
 Under every social system only the surplus product can be the landowner’s source of“income. 
” In both respects the labour-service system ofeconomy is fully identical with the capitalist system,Mr. 
 Kablukov’s opinion notwithstanding. 
 The real differencebetween them is that labour-service necessarily presupposes the lowest productivity of labour; hence, no possibility exists for increasing income by increasing the surplus prod-uct; that can only be done by one means, namely, byemploying all sorts of bonded forms of hire. 
 Under purely capi-talist economy, on the contrary, bonded forms of hire mustgo by the board, for the proletarian, not being tied to the land, is useless as an object of bondage;—to raise the productivity of labour becomes not only possible, but also necessary as the sole means of increasing income and with-standing severe competition. 
 Thus, the description of our purely capitalist farms, given by the very Mr. 
 Kablukov who so zealously tried to idealise labour-service, fully confirms the fact that Russian capitalism is creating the social conditions which necessarily demand the rationalisation of agriculture and the abolition of bondage, whereas labour-service, on the contrary, precludes the possibility of ration-alising agriculture and perpetuates technical stagnation and the producer’s condition of bondage. 
 Nothing could be more frivolous than the customary Narodnik exultation over the fact that capitalism in our agriculture is weak. 
 So much the worse if it is weak, for it only indicates the strength of pre-capitalist forms of exploitation, which are incomparably more burdensome to the producer. 
 VI. 
 THE STORY OF ENGELHARDT’S FARM Quite a special place among the Narodniks is held by Engelhardt. 
 To criticise his appraisal of labour-service andcapitalism would mean to repeat what has already been said in the preceding section. 
 We think it far more expedi-ent to set against Engelhardt’s Narodnik views the storyof Engelhardt’s own farm. 
 Such a critique will also be ofpositive value, because the evolution of this farm reflectsin miniature, as it were, the main features of the evolutionof all private-landowner farming in post-Reform Russia. 
 When Engelhardt settled down on the farm it was based on the traditional labour-service and bondage, whichpreclude “proper farming” ( Letters from the Countryside , 559). 
 Labour-service was the cause of the poor condition of cattle-raising, of the poor cultivation of the soil and of the monoto-nous persistence of obsolete systems of field cultivation (118). 
 “I saw that it was impossible . 
 . 
 . 
 to go on farming in the old way” (118). 
 The competition of grain from thesteppe regions was bringing down prices and making farm-ing unprofitable (p. 
 83). 
 * We would observe that from the *This fact that the competition of cheap grain serves as the motive for change in technique and, consequently , for replacing labour-service by free hire, deserves special attention. 
 The competition ofgrain from the steppe regions was also felt even in the years of high very outset, along with the labour-service system a certain part was played on the farm by the capitalist system: wage-workers, although very few in number, were also employed on the farm when it was run in the old way (the cow-man and others), and Engelhardt asserts that the wages ofhis farm labourer (drawn from among allotment-holdingpeasants) were “fabulously low” (11), low because “ it was impossible to give more ” considering that cattle-raising was in a bad way. 
 The low productivity of labour made it impossible to raise wages. 
 Thus, the starting-point on Engelhardt’sfarm was the features, familiar to us, of all Russian farms:labour-service, bondage, the very lowest productivity oflabour, “incredibly low” payment of labour, routine farm-ing. 
 What changes did Engelhardt introduce into this state of things? He began to sow flax—a commercial and indus-trial crop requiring the employment of labour on a big scale. 
The commercial and capitalist character of the cultivationwas accordingly enhanced. 
 But how was he to obtain labour?Engelhardt tried at first to employ in the new (commer-cial) cultivation the old system, that of labour-service. 
 Nothing came of that; the work was badly done, the “des-siatine” proved to be beyond the strength of the peasants,who resisted with all their might “gang work” and bondedterms of labour. 
 “The system had to be changed. 
 MeanwhileI got on my feet. 
 I acquired my own horses, harness, carts, ploughs and harrows and was already in a position to run the farm with regular workers. 
 I began to produce flax, partlywith my regular workers and partly on a job basis, hiringlabourers for definite jobs” (218). 
 Thus, the transition to thenew system of farming and to commercial cultivationdemanded the replacement of labour-service by the capitalist system. 
 To increase productivity of labour, Engelhardt resorted to the well-tried method of capitalist production:piece work. 
 Women were engaged to work by the stack, or thepood, and Engelhardt (not without some naïve triumph)tells of the success of this system; the cost of cultivationincreased (from 25 rubles per dess. 
 to 35 rubles), but profit also increased by 10 to 20 rubles; the women’s productivity grain prices; the period of low prices, however, lends this competition particular force. 
 of labour increased following the change from bonded to hired labour (from half a pood per night to a whole pood) and the earnings of the women increased to 30-50 kopeks per day (“unprecedented in our parts”). 
 The local textile mer-chant was full of praise for Engelhardt: “Your flax hasgiven a great fillip to trade” (219). 
 Applied at first to the cultivation of the commercial crop, hired labour gradually began to embrace other agricultural operations. 
 One of the first operations to be withdrawn by capital from the labour-service system was threshing. 
It is well known that on all farms run by privatelandowners this work is mostly performed on capitalistlines. 
 “Part of the land,” wrote Engelhardt, “I lease to peas-ants for cultivation in cycles, for otherwise I would find it hard to cope with the reaping of the rye” (211). 
 Thus, labour-service functions as a direct transition to capitalism, byensuring the farmer a supply of day labourers in the busiestseason. 
 At first cycle-cultivation included threshing, buthere, too, the poor quality of the work done compelledthe farmer to resort to hired labour. 
 Land began to be leased for cycle-cultivation without threshing, which latter was done partly by farm labourers and partly, through the mediumof a contractor, by a team of wage-workers, at piece rates. 
Here, too, the results of replacing labour-service by the capi-talist system were: 1) an increase in the productivity oflabour: formerly 16 people threshed 900 sheaves per day, now 8 did 1,100 sheaves; 2) an increase in the yield; 3) a reduction in threshing time; 4) an increase in the work-er’s earnings; 5) an increase in the farmer’s profits (212). 
 Further, the capitalist system also embraced tillage opera-tions. 
 Iron ploughs were introduced in place of the old woodenones, and the work passed from the bound peasant to the farm labourer. 
 Engelhardt triumphantly reports the success of his innovation, the diligence of the labourers,and quite justly shows that the customary accusations flungat the labourer of being lazy and dishonest are due to the“brand of serfdom” and to bonded labour “for the lord,” andthat the new organisation of farming also demands something of the farmer: a display of enterprise, a knowledge of people and ability to handle them, a knowledge of the job and its scope, acquaintance with the technical and commercial aspects of agriculture—i. 
e. 
, qualities that were not and could not be possessed by the Oblomovs89 of the feudal or bondage-suffering countryside. 
 The various changes in the technique of agriculture are inseparably connected with one anotherand inevitably lead to the transformation of its economy. 
For example, let us suppose you introduce the cultivationof flax and clover—that will immediately necessitate numer-ous other changes, and if these are not made, the business will not run smoothly. 
 The ploughing implements will have to be changed and iron ploughs substituted for wooden ones,iron harrows for wooden ones, and this in turn will require adifferent type of horse, a different type of labourer, a different system of farming as regards the hire of labourers , etc. 
” (154-155). 
 The change in the technique of agriculture thus proved to be inseparably bound up with the elimination of labour-service by capitalism. 
 Particularly interesting in this regardis the gradualness with which this elimination takes place:the system of farming, as hitherto, combines labour-serviceand capitalism, but the main weight gradually shifts from the former to the latter. 
 Here is a description of how Engelhardt’s reorganised farm operated: Nowadays I have much work to do, because I have changed the whole system of farming. 
 A considerable partof the work is done by regular labourers and day labourers. 
The work is extremely varied. 
 I clear brushwood for wheat growing, uproot birches for flax growing. 
 I have rented meadow land by the Dnieper, and have sown clover, lotsof rye and much flax. 
 I need an enormous number of hands. 
To secure them, you have to make arrangements in goodtime, for when the busy season starts everybody will be occu-pied either at home or on other farms. 
 This recruitment of labour is done by advancing money or grain for work to be done” (pp. 
 116-117). 
 Labour-service and bondage remained, consequently, even on a “properly” conducted farm; but, firstly, they now occu-pied a subordinate position as compared with free hire, and,secondly, the very labour-service underwent a change; it was mainly the second type of labour-service which remained, that implying the labour not of peasant farmers, but ofregular labourers and agricultural day labourers. 
 Thus, Engelhardt’s own farm is better than all arguments in refuting Engelhardt’s Narodnik theories. 
 He set out to farm on rational lines, but was unable to do so, under the given social and economic conditions, except by organisingthe farm on the basis of employing farm labourers. 
 Theraising of the technical level of agriculture and the supplant-ing of labour-service by capitalism proceeded hand in handon this farm, as it does on all private-landowner farms in general in Russia. 
 This process is most clearly reflected in the employment of machinery in Russian agriculture. 
 VII. 
 THE EMPLOYMENT OF MACHINERY IN AGRICULTURE The post-Reform epoch is divided into four periods as regards the development of agricultural machinery productionand the employment of machinery in agriculture. 
 * The first period covers the years immediately preceding the peasantReform and the years immediately following it. 
 The land-lords at first rushed to purchase foreign machinery so as to get along without the “unpaid” labour of the serfs and to avoid the difficulties connected with the hiring of free work-ers. 
 This attempt ended, of course, in failure; the fever soondied down, and beginning with 1863-1864 the demand forforeign machinery dropped. 
 The end of the 70s saw thebeginning of the second period, which continued until 1885. 
 It was marked by an extremely steady and extremely rapid increase in machinery imports from abroad; home produc-tion also grew steadily, but more slowly than imports. 
 From1881 to 1884 there was a particularly rapid increase in *See Historico-Statistical Survey of Russian Industry , Vol.

 imports of agricultural machinery, due partly to the abolition, in 1881, of the duty-free import of pig-iron and cast-iron for the needs of factories producing agricultural machinery. 
 The third period extended from 1885 to the beginning of the90s. 
 Agricultural machinery, hitherto imported duty-free,now had an import duty imposed (of 50 kopeks gold perpood) . 
 The high duty caused an enormous drop in machineryimports, while home production developed slowly owing to the agricultural crisis which set in at that time. 
 Finally, the beginning of the 90s evidently saw the opening of afourth period, marked by a fresh rise in the import of agri-cultural machinery, and by a particularly rapid increaseof its home production. 
 Let us cite statistics to illustrate these points. 
 Average annual imports of agricultural machinery at various periods were as follows: Thousand ThousandPeriodspoodsrubles 1869-1872 259. 
4 787. 
9 1873-1876 566.

2 2,596 1893-1896 864. 
8 4,868 There are, unfortunately, no such complete and precise data on the production of agricultural machinery and implements in Russia. 
 The unsatisfactory state of our factory-and-works statistics, the confusing of the production ofmachinery in general with the production of specificallyagricultural machinery, and the absence of any firmly estab-lished rules for distinguishing between “factory” and “handicraft” production of agricultural machinery—all this prevents a complete picture of the development of agricul-tural machinery production in Russia being obtained. 
Combining all the data available from the above-mentionedsources, we get the following picture of the development ofagricultural machinery production in Russia: Production, imports and employment of agricultural machinery and implements T h o u s a n d s o f r u b l e s 1876 646 415 280 988 2,329 1,628 3,957 1879 1,088 433 557 1,752 3,830 4,000 7,830 1890 498 217 2,360 1,971 5,046 2,519 7,565 1894 381 314 6,183 2,567 9,445 5,194 14,639 These data show the vigorousness of the process in which primitive agricultural implements are giving way to improved ones (and, consequently, primitive forms of farming to capitalism). 
 In 18 years the employment of agri-cultural machinery increased more than 3. 
5-fold, and thiswas mainly because of the expansion of home production,which more than quadrupled. 
 Noteworthy, too, was theshifting of the main centre of such production from the Vistula and Baltic gubernias to the south-Russian steppe gubernias. 
 Whereas in the 70s the main centre of agricul-tural capitalism in Russia was the western outer gubernias,in the 1890s still more outstanding areas of agriculturalcapitalism were created in the purely Russian gubernias. 
 * It is necessary to add, regarding the data just cited, that although they are based on official (and, as far as we know, the only) information on the subject under examination, theyare far from complete and are not fully comparable for thedifferent years. 
 For the years 1876-1879 returns are availablethat were specially compiled for the 1882 exhibition; they are the most comprehensive, covering not only “factory” *To make possible a judgement of the way the situation has changed in recent years, we quote data from the Yearbook of Russia (published by Central Statistical Committee, St. 
 Petersburg, 1906), for1900-1903. 
 The value of the output of agricultural machinery in theEmpire is estimated at 12,058,000 rubles, and of imports in 1902at 15,240,000 rubles, and in 1903 at 20,615,000 rubles.

 The enormous difference in these figures is explained by the fact that of the 340 establishments less than one-third (100) were counted as possessing steampower, and more than half (196) as being operated by handlabour; 236 establishments of the 340 had no foundries oftheir own and had their castings made outside ( Historico-Statistical Survey , loc. 
 cit. 
). 
 The data for 1890 and 1894, on the other hand, are from Collections of Data on Factory Industry in Russia (published by Department of Commerce and Industry). 
 * These data do not fully cover even the “factory” production of agricultural machinery and imple-ments; for example, in 1890, according to the Collection , there were in European Russia 149 works engaged in this industry, whereas Orlov’s Directory mentions more than 163 works producing agricultural machinery and implements;in 1894, according to the first-mentioned returns, there werein European Russia 164 works of this kind ( Vestnik Finansov , 1897, No. 
 21, p. 
 544), but according to the List of Factories and Works there were in 1894-95 over 173 factories producing agricultural machinery and implements. 
 As for the small-scale, “handicraft” production of agricultural machinery andimplements, this is not included in these data at all. 
 ** That *In the Vestnik Finansov , No. 
 21, for 1897, comparative data are given for 1888-1894, but their source is not given specifically. 
 **The total number of workshops engaged in the manufacture and repair of agricultural implements was given for 1864 as 64; for1871 as 112; for 1874 as 203; for 1879 as 340; for 1885 as 435; for 1892 as 400; and for 1895 as approximately 400 ( Agriculture and Forestry in Russia , p. 
 358, and Vestnik Finansov , 1896, No. 
 51). 
 The Collections , on the other hand, estimated that in 1888-1894 there were only from157 to 217 factories of this kind (average of 183 for the 7 years). 
 Hereis an example illustrating the ratio of “factory” production of agri-cultural machinery to “handicraft” production: it was estimated that in Perm Gubernia in 1894 there were only 4 “factories,” with a com-bined output of 28,000 rubles, whereas for this branch of industrythe 1894-95 census showed 94 “handicraft establishments,” with a is why there can be no doubt that the data for 1890 and 1894 greatly understate the actual facts; this is confirmed by the opinion of experts, who considered that in the beginning of the 1890s agricultural machinery and implements weremanufactured in Russia to a sum of about 10 million rubles(Agriculture and Forestry , 359), and in 1895 to a sum of nearly 20 million rubles ( Vestnik Finansov , 1896, No. 
 51). 
 Let us quote somewhat more detailed data on the types and quantity of agricultural machinery and implements man-ufactured in Russia. 
 It is considered that in 1876 therewere produced 25,835 implements; in 1877—29,590; in1878—35,226; in 1879—47,892 agricultural machines andimplements. 
 How far these figures are exceeded at the pres-ent time may be seen from the following: in 1879 about 14,500 iron ploughs were manufactured, and in 1894— 75,500 ( Vestnik Finansov , 1897, No. 
 21). 
 “Whereas five years ago the problem of the measures to be taken to bringabout the wider use of iron ploughs on peasant farms was oneawaiting solution, today it has solved itself. 
 It is no longer ararity for a peasant to buy an iron plough; it has become a common thing, and the number of iron ploughs now acquired by peasants every year runs into thousands. 
” * The mass of primitive agricultural implements employed in Russiastill leaves a wide field for the production and sale of ironploughs. 
 ** The progress made in the use of ploughs has even raised the issue of the employment of electricity. 
 According to a report in the Torgovo-Promyshlennaya Gazeta [Commer-cial and Industrial News ] (1902, No. 
 6), at the Second Con-gress of Electrical Engineers “considerable interest wasaroused by a paper read by V. 
 A. 
 Rzhevsky on ‘Electricity inAgriculture. 
’” The lecturer illustrated by means of someexcellent drawings the tillage of fields in Germany with the aid of electric ploughs, and, from the plan and estimates he had combined output of 50,000 rubles, and what is more, the number of “handicraft” establishments included such as employed 6 wage-workers and had an output of over 8,000 rubles.

 drawn up at a landowner’s request for his estate in one of 3 the southern gubernias, cited figures showing the economies to be effected by this method of tilling the land. 
 According to this plan, it was proposed to plough 540 dess. 
 annually,and a part of this twice a year. 
 The depth of furrow was to befrom 4 2 to 5 vershoks. 
 * The soil was pure black earth. 
 In addition to ploughs, the plan provided for machineryfor other field-work, and also for a threshing machine and a mill, the latter of 25 h. 
p. 
, calculated to operate 2,000 hours per annum. 
 The cost of completely equipping the estate,including six versts of overhead cable of 50-mm. 
 thickness,was estimated at 41,000 rubles. 
 The cost of ploughing onedessiatine would be 7 rubles 40 kopeks if the mill were putup, and 8 rubles 70 kopeks with no mill. 
 It was shown that at the local costs of labour, draught animals, etc. 
, the use of electrical equipment would in the first case effect a saving of 1,013 rubles, while in the second case, less power being used without a mill, the saving would be 966 rubles. 
 No such sharp change is to be noted in the output of threshing and winnowing machines, because their production was relatively well established long ago. 
 ** In fact, a special centre for the “handicraft” production of these machines was established in the town of Sapozhok, Ryazan Gubernia, and the surrounding villages, and the local members of the peasant bourgeoisie made plenty of money at this “industry” (cf. 
 Reports and Investigations , I, pp. 
 208-210). 
 A particu-larly rapid expansion is observed in the production of reap-ing machines. 
 In 1879, about 780 of these machines were produced; in 1893 it was estimated that 7,000 to 8,000 were sold a year, and in 1894-95 about 27,000. 
 In 1895, for example, the works belonging to J. 
 Greaves in the town of Berdyansk, Taurida Gubernia, “the largest works in Europe in this line of production” ( Vestnik Finansov , 1896, No. 
 51) i. 
e. 
, in the production of reaping machines, turned out 4,464 reapers. 
 Among the peasants in Taurida Gubernia reaping machines have become so widespread that a special *7.

 **In 1879 about 4,500 threshing machines were produced, and in 1894-1895 about 3,500. 
 The latter figure, however, does not includeoutput by handicraft industry. 
 occupation has arisen, namely, the mechanical reaping of other people’s grain. 
 * Similar data are available for other, less widespread, agricultural implements. 
 Broadcast seeders, for example,are now being turned out at dozens of works, and the moreperfect row drills, which were produced at only two worksin 1893 ( Agriculture and Forestry , 360), are now turned out at seven works ( Productive Forces , I, 51), whose output has again a particularly wide sale in the south of Russia. 
 Machinery is employed in all branches of agricultureand in all operations connected with the productionof some kinds of produce: in special reviews reference is madeto the extended use of winnowing machines, seed-sorters, seed-cleaners (trieurs), seed-driers, hay presses, flax-scutchers, etc. 
 In the Addendum to the Report on Agriculture for 1898, *In 1893, for example, “700 peasants gathered with their machines on the Uspensky estate belonging to Falz-Fein (who owned 200,000 dessiatines) and offered their services, but half of them went awayempty-handed, as only 350 were engaged” (Shakhovskoi, Agricultural Outside Employments , Moscow, 1896, p. 
 161). 
 In the other steppe gubernias, however, especially the Transvolga gubernias, reapingmachines are not widely used as yet. 
 Still, in recent years these gubernias too have been trying very hard to overtake Novorossia. 
 Thus, the Syzran-Vyazma railway carried agricultural machinery, traction-engines and parts weighing 75,000 poods in 1890, 62,000 poods in 1891,88,000 poods in 1892, 120,000 poods in 1893, and 212,000 poods in1894; in other words, in a matter of five years the quantities carriedalmost trebled. 
 Ukholovo railway station dispatched agricultural machinery of local manufacture to the extent of about 30,000 poods in 1893, and about 82,000 poods in 1894, whereas up to and including1892 the weight of agricultural machinery dispatched from that sta-tion was even less than 10,000 poods per annum. 
 “Ukholovo stationdispatches mainly threshing machines produced in the villages ofKanino and Smykovo, and partly in the uyezd town of Sapozhok, Ryazan Gubernia. 
 In the village of Kanino there are three foundries, belonging to Yermakov, Karev and Golikov, mainly engaged onagricultural-machinery parts. 
 The work of finishing and assemblingthe machines is done in the above-mentioned two villages (Kaninoand Smykovo), of which almost the entire populations are thus em-ployed” ( Brief Review of the Commercial Activity of the Syzran-Vyazma Railway in 1894, Pt. 
 IV, Kaluga, 1896, pp. 
 62-63). 
 Interesting in this example are, first, the fact of the enormous increase in productionprecisely in recent years, which have been years of low grain prices;and, second, the fact of the connection between “factory” and so-called “handicraft” production. 
 The latter is nothing more nor lessthan an “annex” to the factory. 
 published by the Pskov Gubernia Zemstvo Administration (Severny Kurier [Northern Courier ], 1899, No. 
 32), the in-creasing use of machinery is noted, particularly of flax-scutchers, in connection with the transition from flaxproduction for home use to that for commercial purposes. 
There is an increase in the number of iron ploughs. 
 Referenceis made to the influence of migration in augmenting thenumber of agricultural machines and in raising wages. 
 In Stavropol Gubernia (ibid. 
, No. 
 33), agricultural ma-chinery is being employed on an increasing scale in connectionwith the growing immigration into this gubernia. 
 In 1882,there were 908 machines: in 1891-1893, an average of29,275; in 1894-1896, an average of 54,874; and in 1895, asmany as 64,000 agricultural implements and machines. 
 The growing employment of machines naturally gives rise to a demand for engines: along with steam-engines,“oil engines have latterly begun to spread rapidly on ourfarms” (Productive Forces, I, 56), and although the firstengine of this type appeared abroad only seven years ago,there are already 7 factories in Russia manufacturing them. 
 In Kherson Gubernia in the 70s only 134 steam-engines were registered in agriculture ( Material for the Statistics of Steam-Engines in the Russian Empire , St. 
 Petersburg, 1882), and in 1881 about 500 ( Historico-Statistical Survey , Vol. 
 II, section on agricultural implements). 
 In 1884-1886,in three uyezds of the gubernia (out of six), 435 steam thresh-ing machines were registered. 
 “At the present time (1895) there must be at least twice as many” (Tezyakov, Agricul-tural Workers and the Organisation of Sanitary Supervision over Them, in Kherson Gubernia , Kherson, 1896, p. 
 71). 
 The Vestnik Finansov (1897, No. 
 21) states that in Kherson Gu-bernia, “there are about 1,150 steam-threshers, and in the Kuban Region the number is about the same, etc. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 Lat-terly the acquisition of steam-threshers has assumed anindustrial character. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 There have been cases of a five-thousand-ruble threshing machine with steam-engine fullycovering its cost in two or three good harvest years, and ofthe owner immediately getting another on the same terms. 
 Thus, 5 and even 10 such machines are often to be met with on small farms in the Kuban Region. 
 There they have becomean essential accessory of every farm that is at all well organised. 
” “Generally speaking, in the south of Russia today, more than ten thousand steam-engines are in use for agricultural purposes” ( Productive Forces , IX, 151). 
 * If we remember that the number of steam-engines in use in agriculture throughout European Russia in 1875-1878 was only 1,351 and that in 1901, according to incompletereturns ( Collection of Factory Inspectors ’ Reports for 1903 ), the number was 12,091, in 1902—14,609, in 1903—16,021 and in 1904—17,287, the gigantic revolution brought about by capitalism in agriculture in this country during the last twoor three decades will be clear to us. 
 Great service in acceler-ating this process has been rendered by the Zemstvos. 
 Bythe beginning of 1897, Zemstvo agricultural machinery andimplement depots “existed under the auspices of 11 gubernia and 203 uyezd Zemstvo boards, with a total working capital of about a million rubles” ( Vestnik Finansov , 1897, No. 
 21). 
 In Poltava Gubernia, the turnover of the Zemstvo depotsincreased from 22,600 rubles in 1890 to 94,900 rubles in1892 and 210,100 rubles in 1895. 
 In the six years, 12,600iron ploughs, 500 winnowing machines and seed-sorters, 300 reaping machines, and 200 horse-threshers were sold. 
 “The principal buyers of implements at the Zemstvo depots areCossacks and peasants; they account for 70% of the totalnumber of iron ploughs and horse-threshers sold. 
 The pur-chasers of seeding and reaping machines were mainlylandowners, and large ones at that, possessing over 100 dessiatines” ( Vestnik Finansov , 1897, No. 
 4). 
 *Cf. 
 an item from Perekop Uyezd, Taurida Gubernia, in Russkiye Vedomosti [Russian Gazette ] of August 19, 1898 (No. 
 167). 
 “Owing to the widespread use of reaping machines and steam-and horse-threshing machines among our farmers ... field-work is proceeding very rapidly. 
 The old-fashioned method of the threshing with ‘rollers’ is a thing of the past.... 
 Every year the Crimean farmer increases his crop area and therefore has willy-nilly to resort to the aid of improved agricultural implements and machines. 
 While it is not possible with rollers to thresh more than 150 to 200 poods of grain per day, a 10-h. 
p. 
 steam-thresher will do from 2,000 to 2,500 poods, and a horse-thresher from 700 to 800 poods. 
 That is why the demand for agricultural implements, reapers and threshers is growing so rapidly from year to year that the factories and works producing agricultural implements exhaust their stocks, as has happened this year, and are unable to satisfy the farmers’ demand. 
” The drop in grain prices, which compels farmers to reduce production costs, must be regarded as one of the most important causes of the increased use of improved implements. 
 According to the report of the Ekaterinoslav Gubernia Zemstvo Board for 1895, “the use of improved agricultural implements in the gubernia is spreading very rapidly. 
” For example, in the Verkhne-Dnieper Uyezd therewere: 1894 1895 Ploughs, scarifiers and cultivators: ”” ” ” private landowners’ 5,220 6,752 ”” ” ” peasants’ 27,271 30,112 Horse-threshers: ”” private landowners’ 131 290 ”” peasants’ 671 838 (Vestnik Finansov , 1897, No. 
 6) According to the data of the Moscow Gubernia Zemstvo Board, peasants in Moscow Gubernia in 1895 owned 41,210iron ploughs; 20. 
2% of all householders owned such ploughs(Vestnik Finansov , 1896, No. 
 31). 
 In Tver Gubernia, accord-ing to a special record made in 1896, there were 51,266 ironploughs, owned by 16. 
5% of the total number of household-ers. 
 In Tver Uyezd there were only 290 iron ploughs in 1890, and 5,581 in 1896 ( Statistical Returns for Tver Gubernia , Vol. 
 XIII, Pt. 
 2, pp. 
 91, 94). 
 One can judge, therefore, howrapid is the consolidation and improvement of the farmsof the peasant bourgeoisie. 
 VIII. 
 THE SIGNIFICANCE OF MACHINERY IN AGRICULTURE Having established the fact of the extremely rapid devel-opment of the production of agricultural machinery and of the employment of machines in Russia’s post-Reform agriculture, we must now examine the social and eco-nomic significance of this phenomenon. 
 From what has beensaid above regarding the economics of peasant and land-lord farming, the following conclusions may be drawn:on the one hand, capitalism is the factor giving rise to,and extending the use of, machines in agriculture; on the other, the application of machinery to agriculture is of a capitalist character, i. 
e. 
, it leads to the establishment ofcapitalist relations and their further development. 
 Let us dwell on the first of these conclusions. 
 We have seen that the labour-service system of economy and the patri-archal peasant economy inseparably connected with it are by their very nature based on routine technique, on thepreservation of antiquated methods of production. 
 There isnothing in the internal structure of that economic regime tostimulate the transformation of technique; on the contrary,the secluded and isolated character of that system of econo-my, and the poverty and downtrodden condition of the de-pendent peasant preclude the possibility of improvements. 
 Inparticular, we would point to the fact that the payment oflabour under the labour-service system is much lower (as wehave seen) than where hired labour is employed; and itis well known that low wages are one of the most impor-tant obstacles to the introduction of machines. 
 And the facts do indeed show us that an extensive movement for thetransformation of agricultural technique only commenced inthe post-Reform period of the development of commodityeconomy and capitalism. 
 The competition that is the productof capitalism, and the dependence of the cultivator on the world market made the transformation of technique a neces-sity, while the drop in grain prices made this necessity par-ticularly urgent. 
 * To explain the second conclusion, we must examine land-lord and peasant farming separately. 
 When a landlordintroduces a machine or an improved implement, he replaces the implements of the peasant (who has worked for him) with his own; he goes over, consequently, fromlabour-service to the capitalist system of farming. 
 The spreadof agricultural machines means the elimination of labour-*“In the past two years, under the influence of low grain prices and of the need to cheapen agricultural jobs at all costs, reaping machines have also ... begun to be so widely employed that depots are unable to meet all requirements on time” (Tezyakov, loc cit. 
, p. 
 71). 
The present agricultural crisis is a capitalist crisis. 
 Like all capi-talist crises, it ruins capitalist farmers and peasants in one locality, in one country, in one branch of agriculture, and at the same timegives a tremendous impulse to the development of capitalism in another locality, in another country, in other branches of agriculture. 
 It is the failure to understand this fundamental feature of thepresent crisis and of its economic nature that constitutes the main error in the reasoning on this theme of Messrs. 
 N. 
 —on, Kablukov, etc. 
, etc. 
 service by capitalism. 
 It is possible, of course, that a con-dition laid down, for example, for the leasing of land is the performance of labour-service in the shape of day-work at a reaping machine, thresher, etc. 
, but this will be labour-service of the second type, labour-service which convertsthe peasant into a day labourer. 
 Such “exceptions,” conse-quently, merely go to prove the general rule that the intro-duction of improved implements on the farms of private landowners means converting the bonded (“independent” according to Narodnik terminology) peasant into a wage-work-er—in exactly the same way as the acquisition of his owninstruments of production by the buyer-up, who gives outwork to be done in the home, means converting the bonded“handicraftsman” into a wage-worker. 
 The acquisition by the landlord farm of its own implements leads inevitably to the undermining of the middle peasantry, who get means of sub-sistence by engaging in labour-service: We have already seenthat labour-service is the specific “industry” of the middlepeasant, whose implements, consequently, are a componentpart not only of peasant, but also of landlord, farming. 
 * Hence, the spread of agricultural machinery and improvedimplements and the expropriation of the peasantry areinseparably connected. 
 That the spread of improved imple-ments among the peasantry is of the same significance hard-ly requires explanation after what has been said in thepreceding chapter. 
 The systematic employment of machin-ery in agriculture ousts the patriarchal “middle” peasant as inexorably as the steam-power loom ousts the handicraftweaver. 
 The results of the employment of machinery in agri-culture confirm what has been said, and reveal all the typi-cal features of capitalist progress with all its inherent contra-*Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
 expresses this truth (that the existence of the middle peasant is largely conditioned by the existence of the labour-service system of farming among the landlords) in the following original way:“the owner shares, so to speak, the cost of maintaining his (the peas-ant’s) implements. 
” “It appears,” says Mr. 
 Sanin, in a just commenton this, “that it is not the labourer who works for the landowner,but the landowner who works for the labourer.

 47. 
 dictions. 
 Machines enormously increase the productivity of labour in agriculture, which, before the present epoch, was almost entirely untouched by social development. 
 That is why the mere fact of the growing employment ofmachines in Russian agriculture is sufficient to enable one tosee how utterly unsound is Mr. 
 N. 
 —on’s assertion that there is “absolute stagnation” ( Sketches , p. 
 32) in grain production in Russia, and that there is even a “decline in the productivity” of agricultural labour. 
 We shall return to this assertion, which contradicts generally establishedfacts and which Mr. 
 N. 
 —on needed for his idealisation of the pre-capitalist order. 
 Further, machines lead to the concentration of produc-tion and to the practice of capitalist co-operation in agri-culture. 
 The introduction of machinery, on the one hand, calls for capital on a big scale, and consequently is onlywithin the capacity of the big farmers; on the other hand,machines pay only when there is a huge amount of productsto be dealt with; the expansion of production becomes anecessity with the introduction of machines. 
 The wide use of reaping machines, steam-threshers, etc. 
, is therefore indicative of the concentration of agricultural production—and we shall indeed see later that the Russian agriculturalregion where the employment of machines is particularlywidespread (Novorossia) is also distinguished by the quiteconsiderable size of its farms. 
 Let us merely observe that it would be a mistake to conceive the concentration of agriculture in just the one form of extensive enlargementof the crop area (as Mr. 
 N. 
 —on does); as a matter of fact, the concentration of agricultural production manifests itselfin the most diverse forms, depending on the forms of com-mercial agriculture (see next chapter on this point). 
 The concentration of production is inseparably connected with the extensive co-operation of workers on the farm. 
 Abovewe saw an example of a large estate on which the grainwas harvested by setting hundreds of reaping machines into operation simultaneously. 
 “Threshers drawn by 4 to8 horses require from 14 to 23 and even more workers, half of whom are women and boys, i. 
e. 
, semi-workers. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 The 8 to 10 h. 
 p. 
 steam-threshers to be found on all large farms”(of Kherson Gubernia), “require simultaneously from 50 to 70 workers, of whom more than half are semi-workers, boys and girls of 12 to 17 years of age” (Tezyakov, loc. 
 cit. 
, 93). 
 “Large farms, on each of which from 500 to 1,000 workers are gathered together simultaneously, may safely be likened toindustrial establishments,” the same author justly observes(p. 
 151). 
 * Thus, while our Narodniks were arguing that the “village community” “could easily” introduce co-operationin agriculture, life went on in its own way, and capitalism, splitting up the village community into economic groups with opposite interests, created large farms based on theextensive co-operation of wage-workers. 
 From the foregoing it is clear that machines create a home market for capitalism: first, a market for means ofproduction (for the products of the machine-building indus-try, mining industry, etc. 
, etc. 
), and second, a market for labour-power. 
 The introduction of machines, as we haveseen, leads to the replacement of labour-service by hiredlabour and to the creation of peasant farms employing labour-ers. 
 The mass-scale employment of agricultural machinerypresupposes the existence of a mass of agricultural wage-workers. 
 In the localities where agricultural capitalism is most highly developed, this process of the introduction o f wage-labour along with the introduction of machines isintersected by another process, namely, the ousting ofwage-workers by the machine. 
 On the one hand, the forma-tion of a peasant bourgeoisie and the transition of the landowners from labour-service to capitalism create a demand for wage-workers; on the other hand, in places where farm-ing has long been based on wage-labour, machines oust wage-workers. 
 No precise and extensive statistics are avail-able to show what is the general effect of both these processesfor the whole of Russia, i. 
e. 
, whether the number of ag-ricultural wage-workers is increasing or decreasing. 
 There can be no doubt that hitherto the number has been increasing (see next section). 
 We imagine that now too it is continuing to increase **: firstly, data on the ousting of wage-workers in *Cf. 
 also next chapter, § 2, where more detailed data are given on the size of capitalist farms in this part of Russia. 
 **It hardly needs to be explained that in a country with a mass of peasantry, an absolute increase in the number of agricultural wage-workers is quite compatible not only with a relative, but also withan absolute, decrease of the rural population. 
 agriculture by machines are available only for Novorossia, while in other areas of capitalist agriculture (the Baltic and western region, the outer regions in the East, some of the industrial gubernias) this process has not yet been noted ona large scale. 
 There still remains an enormous area wherelabour-service predominates, and in that area the introduc-tion of machinery is giving rise to a demand for wage-work-ers. 
 Secondly, the growth of intensive farming (introduc-tion of root crops, for example) enormously increases the demand for wage-labour (see Chapter IV). 
 A decline in theabsolute number of agricultural (as against industrial) wage-workers must, of course, take place at a certain stage in thedevelopment of capitalism, namely, when agriculture through-out the country is fully organised on capitalist lines and when the employment of machinery for the most diverse agricultural operations is general. 
 As regards Novorossia, local investigators note here the usual consequences of highly developed capitalism. 
 Machinesare ousting wage-workers and creating a capitalist reservearmy in agriculture. 
 “The days of fabulous prices for hands have passed in Kherson Gubernia too. 
 Thanks to . 
 . 
 . 
 the increased spread of agricultural implements . 
 . 
 . 
” (andother causes) “ the prices of hands are steadily falling ” ments, which makes the large farms independent of workers * the workers in a difficult position” (Tezyakov, loc. 
 cit. 
, 66-71). 
 The same thing is noted by another Zemstvo MedicalOfficer, Mr. 
 Kudryavtsev, in his work Migrant Agricultural Workers at the Nikolayev Fair in the Township of Kakhovka , Taurida Gubernia , and Their Sanitary Supervision in 1895 (Kherson, 1896). 
 “The prices of hands . 
 . 
 . 
 continue to fall, and a considerable number of migrant workers find *Mr. 
 Ponomaryov expresses himself on this score thus. 
 “Ma-chines, by regulating the harvesting price, in all probability dis-cipline the workers at the same time” (article in Selskoye Khozyaistvo i Lesovodstvo [Agriculture and Forestry ], quoted in Vestnik Finansov , 1896, No. 
 14). 
 It will be remembered that the “Pindar of the capital-ist factory,”90 Dr. 
 Andrew Ure, welcomed machines as creating “order” and “discipline” among the workers. 
 Agricultural capitalism in Russia has already managed to create not only “agricultural facto-ries,” but also the “Pindars” of these factories. 
(author’s italics ). 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 “The distribution of agricultural imple-and at the same time reduces the demand for hands, places themselves without employment and are unable to earn anything; i. 
e. 
, there is created what in the language of economic science is called a reserve army of labour—artifi-cial surplus-population” (61). 
 The drop in the prices of labourcaused by this reserve army is sometimes so great that“many farmers possessing machines preferred” (in 1895)“to harvest with hand labour rather than with machines”(ibid. 
, 66, from Sbornik Khersonskogo Zemstva [Kherson Zemstvo Symposium ], August 1895)! More strikingly and convincingly than any argument this fact reveals how pro-found are the contradictions inherent in the capitalistemployment of machinery! Another consequence of the use of machinery is the grow-ing employment of female and child labour. 
 The existing system of capitalist agriculture has, generally speaking, given rise to a certain hierarchy of workers, very much remi-niscent of the hierarchy among factory workers. 
 For exam-ple, on the estates in South Russia there are the followingcategories: a) full workers , adult males capable of doing all jobs b) semi-workers , women and males up to the age of 20; semi-workers are divided again into two categories: aa) 12, 13 to 15, 16 years of age—these are semi-workers in the strict-er sense of the term—and bb) semi-workers of great strength ; “in the language used on the estates, ‘three-quarter’ work-ers,” * from 16 to 20 years of age, capable of doing all the jobs done by the full worker, except mowing. 
 Lastly, c) semi-workers rendering little help , children not under 8 and not over 14 years of age; these act as swine-herds, calf-herds,weeders and plough-boys. 
 Often they work merely for theirfood and clothing. 
 The introduction of agricultural imple-ments “lowers the price of the full worker’s labour” and renderspossible its replacement by the cheaper labour of women and juveniles. 
 Statistics on migrant labour confirm the fact of the displacement of male by female labour: in 1890, ofthe total number of workers registered in the township ofKakhovka and in the city of Kherson, 12. 
7% were women;in 1894, for the whole gubernia women constituted 18. 
2%(10,239 out of 56,464); in 1895, 25. 
6% (13,474 out of 48,753). 
 Children in 1893 constituted 0. 
7% (from 10 to 14 years of *Tezyakov, loc. 
 cit. 
, 72. 
 age), and in 1895, 1. 
69% (from 7 to 14 years of age). 
 Among local workers on estates in Elisavetgrad Uyezd, Kherson Gubernia, children constituted 10. 
6% (ibid. 
). 
 Machines increase the intensity of the workers’ labour. 
 For example, the most widespread type of reaping machine(with hand delivery) has acquired the characteristic nameof “lobogreyka” or “chubogreyka,” * since working with it calls for extraordinary exertion on the part of the worker: he takes the place of the delivery apparatus (cf. 
 Productive Forces , I, 52). 
 Similarly, intensity of labour increases with the use of the threshing machine. 
 The capitalist mode ofemploying machinery creates here (as everywhere) a power-ful stimulus to the lengthening of the working day. 
 Nightwork, something previously unknown, makes its appear-ance in agriculture too. 
 “In good harvest years . 
 . 
 . 
 work on some estates and on many peasant farms is carried on evenat night” (Tezyakov, loc. 
 cit. 
, 126), by artificial illumina-tion—torchlight (92). 
 Finally, the systematic employmentof machines results in traumatism among agricultural work-ers; the employment of young women and children at machines naturally results in a particularly large toll of inju-ries. 
 The Zemstvo hospitals and dispensaries in KhersonGubernia, for example, are filled, during the agriculturalseason, “almost exclusively with traumatic patients” andserve as “field hospitals, as it were, for the treatment of theenormous army of agricultural workers who are constantly being disabled as a result of the ruthless destructive work of agricultural machines and implements” (ibid. 
, 126). 
 A spe-cial medical literature is appearing that deals with injuriescaused by agricultural machines. 
 Proposals are being madeto introduce compulsory regulations governing the use ofagricultural machines (ibid. 
). 
 The large-scale manufacture of machinery imperatively calls for public control and regula-tion of production in agriculture, as in industry. 
 Of theattempts to introduce such control we shall speak below. 
 Let us note, in conclusion, the extremely inconsistent attitude of the Narodniks towards the employment of machin-ery in agriculture. 
 To admit the benefit and progressive nature of the employment of machinery, to defend all *Literally “brow-heater” or “forelock-heater. 
”— Ed. 
 measures that develop and facilitate it, and at the same time to ignore the fact that machinery in Russian agriculture is employed in the capitalist manner, means to sink to the view-point of the small and big agrarians. 
 Yet what our Narod-niks do is precisely to ignore the capitalist character of theemployment of agricultural machinery and improved imple-ments, without even attempting to analyse what types ofpeasant and landlord farms introduce machinery. 
 Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
 angrily calls Mr. 
 V. 
 Chernyayev “a representative of capi-talist technique” ( Progressive Trends , 11). 
 Presumably it is Mr. 
 V. 
 Chernyayev, or some other official in the Minis-try of Agriculture, who is to blame for the fact that theemployment of machinery in Russia is capitalist in charac-ter! Mr. 
 N. 
 —on, despite his grandiloquent promise “not to depart from the facts” ( Sketches , XIV), has preferred to ignore the fact that it is capitalism that has developed theemployment of machinery in our agriculture, and he has eveninvented the amusing theory that exchange reduces theproductivity of labour in agriculture (p. 
 74)! To criticisethis theory, which is proclaimed without any analysis of the facts, is neither possible nor necessary. 
 Let us confine our-selves to citing a small sample of Mr. 
 N. 
 —on’s reasoning. 
 “If,” says he, “the productivity of labour in this country wereto double, we should have to pay for a chetvert (about sixbushels) of wheat not 12 rubles, but six, that is all” (234). 
Not all, by far, most worthy economist. 
 “In this country” (as indeed in any society where there is commodity economy), the improvement of technique is undertaken by individualfarmers, the rest only gradually following suit. 
 “In thiscountry,” only the rural entrepreneurs are in a positionto improve their technique. 
 “In this country,” this progressof the rural entrepreneurs, small and big, is inseparably connected with the ruin of the peasantry and the creation of a rural proletariat. 
 Hence, if the improved technique used onthe farms of rural entrepreneurs were to become sociallynecessary (only on that condition would the price be reducedby half), it would mean the passing of almost the whole ofagriculture into the hands of capitalists, it would mean the complete proletarisation of millions of peasants, it would mean an enormous increase in the non-agricultural popula-tion and an increase in the number of factories (for the productivity of labour in our agriculture to double, there must be an enormous development of the machine-building industry, the mining industry, steam transport, the con-struction of a mass of new types of farm buildings, shops, ware-houses, canals, etc. 
, etc. 
). 
 Mr. 
 N. 
 —on here repeats the little error of reasoning that is customary with him: he skips overthe consecutive steps that are necessary with the develop-ment of capitalism, he skips over the intricate complex of social-economic changes which necessarily accompany the development of capitalism, and then weeps and wails overthe danger of “destruction” by capitalism. 
 IX. 
 WAGE-LABOUR IN AGRICULTURE We now pass to the principal manifestation of agricultur-al capitalism—to the employment of hired labour. 
 Thisfeature of post-Reform economy was marked most stronglyin the outer regions of south and east European Russia,in that mass shift of agricultural wage-workers known asthe “agricultural migration. 
” For this reason we shall first cite data concerning this main region of agricultural capi-talism in Russia and then examine the data relating to thewhole of Russia. 
 The tremendous movements of our peasants in search of work for hire have long ago been noted in our literature. 
Reference to them was made by Flerovsky ( Condition of the Working Class in Russia , St. 
 Petersburg, 1869), who tried to determine their relative incidence in the various guber-nias. 
 In 1875, Mr. 
 Chaslavsky gave a general review of“agricultural outside employments” ( Compendium of Polit-ical Knowledge , Vol. 
 II) and noted their real significance (“there was formed . 
 . 
 . 
 something in the nature of a semi-vagrant population . 
 . 
 . 
 something in the nature of future farm labourers”). 
 In 1887, Mr. 
 Raspopin gathered togetherZemstvo statistics on this phenomenon and regarded themnot as “employments” of the peasants in general, but as aprocess of the formation of a class of wage-workers in agricul-ture. 
 In the 90s, the works of Messrs. 
 S. 
 Korolenko, Rudnev, Tezyakov, Kudryavtsev and Shakhovskoi appeared, thanks to which a much fuller study of this phenomenon was made. 
 The principal area to which agricultural wage-workers migrate embraces Bessarabia, Kherson, Taurida, Ekate-rinoslav, Don, Samara, Saratov (southern part) and Orenburg gubernias. 
 We confine ourselves to European Russia, but it must be observed that the movement spreads, ever furtherafield (especially in the recent period), and covers the NorthCaucasus and the Ural region, etc. 
 Data concerning capital-ist agriculture in this area (the area of commercial grainfarming) will be given in the next chapter; there, too, we shall point to other localities to which agricultural labourers migrate. 
 The principal area from which agriculturallabourers migrate is the central black-earth gubernias:Kazan, Simbirsk, Penza, Tambov, Ryazan, Tula, Orel,Kursk, Voronezh, Kharkov, Poltava, Chernigov, Kiev,Podolia and Volhynia. 
 * Thus the movement of workers proceeds from the most thickly-populated to the most thinly-populated localities, the ones being colonised; from thelocalities where serfdom was most developed to those whereit was least developed **; from localities where labour-serv-ice is most developed to localities where it is little devel-oped and capitalism is highly developed. 
 Hence, the workers flee from “semi-free” to free labour. 
 It would be a mistake to think that this flight amounts exclusively to a movementfrom thickly-populated to thinly-populated areas. 
 A studyof the movement of workers (Mr. 
 S. 
 Korolenko, loc. 
 cit. 
)has revealed the singular and important fact that workersmigrate from many areas in such great numbers as to create a shortage of hands in these places, one that is com-pensated by the arrival of workers from other places. 
 Hence,the departure of workers expresses not only the tendency ofthe population to spread more evenly over the giventerritory, but also the tendency of the workers to go to areaswhere conditions are better. 
 This tendency will become quite clear to us if we recall that in the area of departure, the area of labour-service, agricultural workers’ wages are *In Chapter VIII, where we examine the movement of wage-workers in Russia as an entire process, we shall describe in greaterdetail the character and direction of migration from the various localities. 
 **In his day Chaslavsky pointed out that in the localities in which workers arrived, serfs constituted from 4 to 15% of the total,and in the localities which workers left, from 40 to 60%. 
 particularly low , while in the area of attraction, the area of capitalism, wages are far higher. 
 * As to the extent of “agricultural migration,” general data exist only in the above-mentioned book by Mr. 
 S. 
Korolenko, who calculates the surplus of workers (relativeto the local demand for them) at 6,360,000 for the whole ofEuropean Russia, including 2,137,000 in the above-enumerat-ed 15 gubernias of agricultural emigration, whereas in the 8 gubernias of immigration the shortage of workers is esti-mated at 2,173,000 persons. 
 Despite the fact that Mr. 
 S. 
 Ko-rolenko’s methods of calculation are by no means alwayssatisfactory, his general conclusions (as we shall see repeat-edly below) must be regarded as approximately correct,and the number of migratory workers not only not an exag-geration, but if anything an understatement of the facts. 
 There can be no doubt that part of these two million workerswho come to the South are non-agricultural workers. 
 ButMr. 
 Shakhovskoi (loc. 
 cit. 
) estimates quite arbitrarily,approximately, that industrial workers account for half thisnumber. 
 Firstly, we know from all sources that the workers who migrate to this region are mainly agricultural, and sec-ondly, agricultural workers come there not only from thegubernias mentioned above. 
 Mr. 
 Shakhovskoi himself quotesa figure which confirms Mr. 
 S. 
 Korolenko’s calculations. 
He states that in 11 black-earth gubernias (which are includ-ed in the above-described area from which agricultural work-ers emigrate) there were issued in 1891 a total of 2,000,703 passports and identity cards (loc. 
 cit. 
, p. 
 24), whereasaccording to Mr. 
 S. 
 Korolenko’s calculations the number ofworkers who left these gubernias was only 1,745,913. 
 Con-sequently, Mr. 
 S. 
 Korolenko’s figures are not in the leastexaggerated, and the total number of migratory rural workers in Russia must obviously be over 2 million. 
 ** The *See table of data for 10 years in Chapter VIII, §IV: the for-mation of a home market for labour-power. 
 **There is another way of checking Mr. 
 S. 
 Korolenko’s figure. 
 We learn from the above-quoted books of Messrs. 
 Tezyakov and Kud-ryavtsev that the number of agricultural workers who in their search for “employments” use the railways at least in part, is about 0 of the total workers (combining the figures of both authors, we get the result that out of 72,635 workers interrogated, only 7,827 trav-elled at least part of the journey by rail). 
 Yet the number of workers existence of such a mass of “peasants” who abandon their homes and allotments (where they have homes and allot-ments) vividly testifies to the tremendous process of the conversion of small cultivators into rural proletarians, ofthe enormous demand by growing agricultural capitalismfor wage-labour. 
 The question now arises, what is the total number of rural wage-workers in European Russia, both migratory and resident? The only attempt to answer this question that we know is the one made in Mr. 
 Rudnev’s work Peasant Industries in European Russia ( Sbornik Saratovskogo Zem-stva [Symposium of the Saratov Zemstvo ], 1894, Nos. 
 6 and 11). 
 This work, an extremely valuable one, gives a summaryof the Zemstvo statistics for 148 uyezds in 19 gubernias of European Russia. 
 The total number of “industrialists” is put at 2,798,122, out of 5,129,863 working males (18 to60 years of age), i. 
e. 
, 55% of the total number of workingpeasants. 
 * Under “agricultural industries” the author includes only work as hired agricultural labourers (farm labourers, day labourers, herdsmen, stockyard workers). 
 An estimate of the percentage of agricultural workers to the total number of males of working age in various guberniasand districts of Russia, leads the author to the conclusion carried in 1891 by the three principal railways in the direction exam-ined does not exceed 200,000 (170,000 to 189,000)—as we are toldby Mr. 
 Shakhovskoi (loc. 
 cit. 
, p. 
 71, according to railway returns). 
Consequently, the total number of workers leaving for the Southmust be about 2 million. 
 Incidentally, the very small proportion ofagricultural workers who travel by rail points to the incorrectness of Mr. 
 N. 
 —on’s view when he assumed that the passenger traffic on our railways is in the main that of agricultural workers. 
 Mr. 
 N. 
 —on lost sight of the fact that non-agricultural workers receive higherwages and therefore make greater use of the railways and that themigration season of these workers (for example, builders, navvies,stevedores and many others) is also spring and summer. 
 *By “industries,” as Mr. 
 Rudnev also points out, are meant all sorts ot occupations by peasants except cultivation on their own,purchased or rented land. 
 Undoubtedly, the majority of these “in-dustrialists” are wage-workers in agriculture or in industry. 
 Wetherefore call the reader’s attention to the closeness of these figuresto our estimate of the number of rural proletarians: in Chapter II, it was assumed that the latter constitute about 40% of the peasants. 
 Here we see that “industrialists” constitute 55%, and of these, in allprobability, over 40% are engaged in all sorts of hired labour. 
 that in the black-earth belt about 25% of all working males are engaged in hired agricultural labour, and in the non-black-earth area about 10%. 
 This gives us the number of agricultural workers in European Russia as 3,395,000, or,in round numbers, 3 2 million (Rudnev, loc. 
 cit. 
, p. 
 448. 
 This number is about 20% of the total number of males ofworking age). 
 It must be observed in this connection that,according to Mr. 
 Rudnev, “day labour and agricultural job-work were placed in the category of industries by the statisticians only when they were the chief occupation ofthe given person or family” (loc. 
 cit. 
, 446). 
 * Mr. 
 Rudnev’s figure should be regarded as the minimum, because, firstly, the Zemstvo census returns are more orless out-of-date, relating to the 80s and at times even to the 70s, and because, secondly, in determining the percent-age of agricultural workers, no account whatever was takenof the Baltic and Western gubernias, where agriculturalcapitalism is highly developed. 
 For want of other data,however, we are obliged to take this figure of 3 2 mil-lion. 
 It appears, consequently, that about one-fifth of the peas-ants have already reached a position where their “chiefoccupation” is that of wage-labour for rich peasants and land-lords. 
 We see here the first group of the entrepreneurs who present a demand for the labour-power of the rural proletar-iat. 
 These are the rural entrepreneurs, who employ about half of the bottom group of the peasantry . 
 Thus, there is to be observed a complete interdependence between the formationof a class of rural entrepreneurs and the expansion of thebottom group of the “peasantry,” i. 
e. 
, the increase in the number of rural proletarians. 
 Among these rural entrepre-neurs a prominent part is played by the peasant bourgeoi-sie: for example, in 9 uyezds of Voronezh Gubernia, 43. 
4%of the farm labourers are employed by peasants (Rudnev,434). 
 Were we to take this percentage as the standard forall rural workers and for the whole of Russia, it would be seen that the peasant bourgeoisie present a demand for *This figure does not include, therefore, the mass of peasants for whom hired agricultural labour is not the chief occupation, but one of equal importance with their own farms. 
 /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR some one and a half million agricultural workers. 
 One and the same “peasantry” throws on to the market millions of work-ers in search of employers—and presents an impressive demand for wage-workers. 
 X. 
 THE SIGNIFICANCE OF HIRED LABOUR IN AGRICULTURE Let us now attempt to depict the principal features of the new social relations that take shape in agriculture withthe employment of hired labour, and to define their signif-icance. 
 The agricultural workers who come to the South in such masses belong to the poorest strata of the peasantry. 
 Of the workers who come to Kherson Gubernia, /FL0133 make the journey on foot, since they lack the money for railway fare;“they tramp for hundreds and thousands of versts alongthe railway track and the banks of navigable rivers, admir-ing the splendid pictures of rapidly-moving trains andsmoothly-gliding ships” (Tezyakov, 35). 
 On the average, the worker takes with him about 2 rubles *; often enough he even lacks the money to pay for a passport, and gets a monthlyidentity card for ten kopeks. 
 The journey takes from10 to 12 days, and after such a long tramp (sometimesundertaken barefoot in the cold spring mud), the travel-ler’s feet swell and become calloused and bruised. 
 About 0 of the workers travel on dubi (large boats made out of rough boards, holding from 50 to 80 persons and usuallypacked to the limit). 
 The reports of an official commission(the Zvegintsev Commission) 91 note the grave danger of this form of travel: “not a year passes but that one, two oreven more of these overcrowded dubi go to the bottom with their passengers” (ibid. 
, 34). 
 The overwhelming majority of the workers have allotments, but of absolutely insignif-icant dimensions. 
 “As a matter of fact,” Mr. 
 Tezyakov quitejustly observes, “all these thousands of agricultural workersare landless village proletarians, for whom outside employ-*Money for the journey is obtained by the sale of property, even household goods, by mortgaging the allotment, by pawning things,clothes, etc. 
, and even by borrowing money, to be repaid in labour,from priests, landlords and local kulaks” (Shakhovskoi, 55). 
 ness is growing rapidly, and at the same time is swelling the ranks of the rural proletariat” (77). 
 Striking confirmation of the rapidity of this growth is the number of workernovices, i. 
e. 
, of those seeking employment for the first time. 
These novices constitute as many as 30%. 
 Incidentally, thisfigure enables us to judge how rapid is the process thatcreates bodies of permanent agricultural workers. 
 The mass migration of workers has given rise to special forms of hire peculiar to highly-developed capitalism. 
 Inthe South and South-East, numerous labour markets havearisen where thousands of workers gather and employersassemble. 
 These markets are usually held in towns, indus-trial centres, trading villages and at fairs. 
 The industrial character of the centres is of particular attraction to the workers, who readily accept employment on non-agriculturaljobs, too. 
 Thus, in Kiev Gubernia, labour marketsare held in Shpola and Smela (large centres of the beet-sugar industry), and in the town of Belaya Tserkov. 
In Kherson Gubernia, they are held in the commercial villages (Novoukrainka, Birzula and Mostovoye, where on Sundays over 9,000 workers gather, and many other vil-lages), at railway stations (Znamenka, Dolinskaya, etc. 
), andin towns (Elisavetgrad, Bobrinets, Voznesensk, Odessa, andothers). 
 In the summer, townspeople, labourers and “cadets”(the local name for tramps) from Odessa also come to hire themselves out for agricultural work. 
 In Odessa rural workers hire themselves out in what is called SeredinskayaSquare (or the “Mowers’ Market”). 
 “The workers make forOdessa, avoiding other markets, in the hope of gettingbetter earnings here” (Tezyakov, 58). 
 The township of KrivoiRog is an important centre where workers are hired for agri-culture and mining. 
 In Taurida Gubernia, the township of Kakhovka is particularly noted for its labour market, whereformerly as many as 40,000 workers gathered; in the ninetiesfrom 20,000 to 30,000 gathered there, and now, judging fromcertain data, the number is still smaller. 
 In Bessarabia Gubernia, mention should be made of the town of Akkerman; in Ekaterinoslav Gubernia, of the town of Ekaterinoslav, andLozovaya Station; in Don Gubernia, of Rostov-on-Don, frequented every year by as many as 150,000 workers. 
 Inments are now the sole means of livelihood .

 . 
 Landless-North Caucasus, of the towns of Ekaterinodar and Novo-rossiisk, Tikhoretskaya Station, and other places. 
 In Samara Gubernia, of the village of Pokrovskaya (opposite Saratov), the village of Balakovo and other places. 
 In SaratovGubernia, of the towns of Khvalynsk and Volsk. 
 In Sim-birsk Gubernia, of the town of Syzran. 
 Thus, capitalism hascreated in the outer regions a new form of the “combination ofagriculture with industries,” namely, the combination of agricultural and non-agricultural hired labour. 
 Such a combination is possible on a wide scale only in the period ofthe final and highest stage of capitalism, that of large-scalemachine industry, which attenuates the importance of skill,of “hand labour,” facilitates the transition from one occupa-tion to another, and levels the forms of hire. 
 * Indeed, the forms of hire in this locality are very pecu-liar and very characteristic of capitalist agriculture. 
 All thesemi-patriarchal, semi-bonded forms of hired labour whichone so frequently meets in the central black-earth beltdisappear here. 
 The only relationships left are thosebetween hirers and hired, a commercial transaction for the purchase and sale of labour-power. 
 As always under developed capitalist relations, the workers prefer hire by the day, orby the week, which enables them to make the pay correspondmore exactly to the demand for labour. 
 “Prices are fixedfor the area of each market (within a radius of about 40versts) with mathematical precision, and it is very hard for the employers to beat down the price, because the muzhik who has come to the market prefers to lie aroundor go on to another place rather than work for lower pay”(Shakhovskoi, 104). 
 It goes without saying that violentfluctuations in prices paid for labour cause innumerablebreaches of contract—only not on one side, as the employers usually claim, but on both sides: “concerted action is taken by both sides”: the labourers agree among themselves *Mr. 
 Shakhovskoi refers to another form of the combination of agricultural and non-agricultural labour. 
 Thousands of rafts are floateddown the Dnieper to the towns in the lower reaches of the river. 
 On every raft there are from 15 to 20 workers (raftsmen), mostly Bye-lorussians and Great-Russians from Orel Gubernia. 
 “For the wholevoyage they get practically nothing”; they count chiefly on gettingemployment at reaping and threshing. 
 These hopes are rewardedonly in “good” years. 
 to demand more, and the employers—to offer less (ibid. 
, 107). 
 * How openly “callous cash payment” reigns here in the relations between the classes may be seen, for example, from the following fact: “experienced employers know verywell” that the workers will “give in” only when they haveeaten up their food stock. 
 “A farmer related that when hecame to the market to hire workers . 
 . 
 . 
 he walked amongthem, poking with his stick at their knapsacks (sic !): if they had bread left, he would not talk to them; he would leave the market” and wait “until the knapsacks in the marketwere empty” (from the Selsky Vestnik [Rural Herald ], 1890, No. 
 15, ibid. 
, 107-108). 
 As under developed capitalism anywhere, so here, we see that the worker is particularly oppressed by small capital. 
 The big employer is forced by sheer commercial considera-tions ** to abstain from petty oppression, which is of little advantage and is fraught with considerable loss shoulddisputes arise. 
 That is why the big employers, for example(those employing from 300 to 800 workers), try to keeptheir workers from leaving at the end of the week, and themselves fix prices according to the demand for labour; some even adopt a system of wage increases if the priceof labour in the area goes up—and all evidence goes toshow that these increases are more than compensated bybetter work and the absence of disputes (ibid. 
, 130-132;104). 
 A small employer, on the contrary, sticks at nothing. 
 “The farmsteaders and German colonists carefully ‘choose’ their workers and pay them 15 or 20% more; but the amountof work they ‘squeeze’ out of them is 50 per cent more”(ibid. 
, 116). 
 The “wenches” who work for such an employer *“At harvest time in a good year the worker triumphs, and it is a hard job to get him to give way. 
 He is offered a price, but he won’t consider it; he keeps repeating: give me what I ask and it’s a go. 
 And that is not because labour is scarce, but because, as theworkers say, ‘it’s our turn now. 
’” (Reported by a volost clerk; Sha-khovskoi, 125. 
)“If the crop is a bad one and the price of labour has dropped, thekulak employer takes advantage of this condition to discharge the worker before the contract has expired, and the worker loses the sea-son either in seeking work in the same district or in tramping thecountry,” a landlord correspondent confesses (ibid. 
, 132).

 The colonists who hire mowers get their sons to follow on their heels (i. 
e. 
, to speed up the workers!) in shifts , so that the speeders-up, replacing one another three times a day, come with renewed energy to drive the workers on: “that is why it is so easy to recognise those who have worked for the Ger-man colonists by their haggard appearance. 
 Generally speak-ing, the farmsteaders and the Germans avoid hiring those who have formerly worked on landowners’ estates. 
 ‘ You ’ll not stand the pace with us ,’ they say quite frankly” (ibid. 
). 
 * Large-scale machine industry, by concentrating large masses of workers, transforming the methods of production,and destroying all the traditional, patriarchal cloaks and screens that have obscured the relations between classes, always leads to the directing of public attention towardsthese relations, to attempts at public control and regula-tion. 
 This phenomenon, which has found particularly strik-ing expression in factory inspection, is also beginning tobe observed in Russian capitalist agriculture, precisely in the region where it is most developed. 
 The question of the workers’ sanitary conditions was raised in Kherson Guber-nia as early as 1875 at the Second Gubernia Congress of Doctors of the Kherson Zemstvo, and was dealt with again in 1888; in 1889 there was drawn up a programme for thestudy of the workers’ conditions. 
 The investigation of sani-tary conditions that was carried out (on a far from adequate scale) in 1889-1890 slightly lifted the veil concealingthe conditions of labour in the remote villages. 
 It was seen, for instance, that in the majority of cases the workers have no living quarters; where barracks are provided, they are usuallyvery badly built from a hygienic point of view, and “not *The same characteristics are displayed by the “Cossacks” of the Kuban Region: “The Cossack resorts to every possible method to force down the price of labour, acting either individually or throughthe community” (sic! What a pity we lack more detailed informationabout this latest function of the “community”!): “cutting down thefood, increasing the work quota, docking the pay, retaining the work-ers’ passports, adopting public resolutions prohibiting specific farmers from employing workers, on pain of a fine, at above a defi-nite rate, etc. 
” (“Migrant Workers in the Kuban Region” by A. 
 Belo-borodov, in Severny Vestnik , February 1896, p. 
 5. 
) infrequently” dug-outs are met with—they are inhabited, for example, by shepherds, who suffer severely from damp-ness, overcrowding, cold, darkness and the stifling atmos-phere. 
 The food provided is very often unsatisfactory. 
 The working day, as a rule, is from 12 2 to 15 hours, which is much longer than the usual working day in large-scaleindustry (11 to 12 hours). 
 An interval during the hottest part of the day is met with only “as an exception”—and cases of brain diseases are no rarity. 
 Work at machines gives riseto occupational division of labour and occupational diseases. 
 For example, working at threshing machines are “drum-mers” (they put the sheaves into the drum; the work is verydangerous and most laborious: thick corn-dust beats into their faces), and “pitchers” (they pitch up the sheaves; the work is so heavy that the shifts have to be changed everyhour or two). 
 Women sweep up the straw, which boys carry aside, while from 3 to 5 labourers stack it in ricks. 
 The num-ber employed on threshing in the whole gubernia mustexceed 200,000 (Tezyakov, 94). 
 * Mr. 
 Tezyakov’s conclusions regarding the sanitary conditions of agricultural work, are as follows: “Generally speaking, the opinion of the ancientsthat the labour of the husbandman is “the pleasantest and healthiest of occupations’ is hardly sound at the present time, when the capitalist spirit reigns in agriculture. 
 With theintroduction of machinery into agriculture, the sanitary con-ditions of agricultural labour have not improved, but have changed for the worse. 
 Machinery has brought into the fieldof agriculture a specialisation of labour so little known here before that it has had the effect of developing among the rural population occupational diseases and a host of seriousinjuries” (94). 
 A result of the investigations into sanitary conditions (after the famine year and the cholera) was the attempt toorganise medical and food depots, at which the labourerswere to be registered, placed under sanitary supervision and provided with cheap dinners. 
 However modest the scale and the results of this organisation may be and however *Let us observe, in passing, that this operation, threshing, is most frequently done by hired labourers. 
 One can judge, thereforehow large must be the number employed on threshing all over Russia! precarious its existence, * it remains an important historical fact, revealing the trends of capitalism in agriculture. 
 At the Congress of Doctors of Kherson Gubernia it was pro-posed, on the basis of data gathered by practitioners: torecognise the importance of medical and food depots andthe need for improving their sanitary condition and extend-ing their activities to give them the character of labourexchanges providing information on the prices of labour and their fluctuations; to extend sanitary inspection to all more or less big farms employing considerable numbers oflabourers, “as is done in industrial establishments” (p. 
 155);to issue strict regulations governing the employment ofagricultural machines and the registration of accidents;to raise the question of the workers’ right to compensation and of providing better and cheaper steam transport. 
 The Fifth Congress of Russian Doctors passed a resolution call-ing the attention of the Zemstvos concerned to the activi-ties of the Kherson Zemstvo in the organisation of medicaland sanitary inspection. 
 In conclusion, let us return to the Narodnik economists. 
 Above we have seen that they idealise labour-service andclose their eyes to the progressive nature of capitalism as com-pared with that system. 
 Now we must add that they areunfavourably disposed to the “migration” of workers, andfavour local “employments. 
” Here, for example, is how this usual Narodnik view is expressed by Mr. 
 N. 
 —on: “The ask, is it advantageous from the economic point of view? Not personally for each individual peasant, but how far is itadvantageous for the peasantry as a whole, from the national-economic point of view? . 
 . 
 . 
 What we want is to point to the purely economic disadvantage of the annual peregrina-tion, God knows where to, for the entire summer, when itwould seem that one could find plenty of occupations athand. 
 . 
 . 
” (23-24). 
 *Of the six uyezd Zemstvo assemblies in Kherson Gubernia, whose views on the question of organising supervision over workers are reported by Mr. 
 Tezyakov, four declared against this system. 
The local landowners accused the gubernia Zemstvo board of “turningthe workers into absolute idlers,” etc. 
peasants . 
 . 
 . 
 set off in quest of wor k. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 How far, one may We assert, the Narodnik theory notwithstanding, that the “peregrination” of the workers not only yields “purely economic” advantages to the workers themselves, but in general should be regarded as progressive; that publicattention should not be directed towards replacing outsideemployments by local “occupations close at hand,” but, onthe contrary, towards removing all the obstacles in the wayof migration, towards facilitating it in every way, towards improving and reducing the costs of all conditions of the workers’ travel, etc. 
 The grounds for our assertion are asfollows: 1) “Purely economic” advantage accrues to the workers from “peregrination” in that they go to places where wagesare higher, where their position as seekers of employment is a more advantageous one. 
 Simple as this argument is, it is too often forgotten by those who love to rise to a higher, alleg-edly “national-economic” point of view. 
 2) “Peregrination” destroys bonded forms of hire and labour-service. 
 Let us recall, for example, that formerly, when migration was little developed, the southern landowners (and other employers) readily resorted to the following system ofhiring labourers: they sent their agents to the northerngubernias and (through the medium of rural officials) hiredtax-defaulters on terms extremely disadvantageous to thelatter. 
 * Those offering employment consequently enjoyed the advantage of free competition, but those seeking it did not. 
 We have quoted instances of the peasant’s readiness toflee from labour-service and bondage even to the mines. 
 It is not surprising, therefore, that on the question of “peregrination ” our agrarians go hand in hand with the Narodniks. 
 Take Mr. 
 S. 
 Korolenko, for example. 
 In his book he quotes numerous opinions of landlords in opposition to the “migration” of workers, and adduces a host of “argu-ments” against “outside employments”: “dissipation,” *Shakhovskoi, loc. 
 cit. 
, 98 and foll. 
 The author cites even the list of “fees” paid to clerks and village elders for the hire of peasantson advantageous terms. 
—Tezyakov: loc. 
 cit. 
, 65. 
—Trirogov The Village Community and the Poll Tax ; article entitled “Bondage in the National Economy. 
” “rowdy habits,” “drunkenness,” “dishonesty,” “the striving to leave the family in order to get rid of it and escape paren-tal supervision,” “the craving for amusement and a brighter life,” etc. 
 But here is a particularly interesting argument:“Finally, as the proverb says, ‘if it stay at one spot, a stonewill gather moss,’ and a man who stays at one spot willcertainly amass property and cherish it” (loc. 
 cit. 
, p. 
 84). 
The proverb does indeed very strikingly indicate what hap-pens to a man who is tied to one spot. 
 Mr. 
 S. 
 Korolenko is particularly displeased with the phenomenon we referredto above, namely, that “too” many workers leave certaingubernias and that the shortage thus created is made good bythe arrival of workers from other gubernias. 
 In noting thisfact as regards, for example, Voronezh Gubernia, Mr. 
 S. 
 Korolenko points to one of the reasons for this, namely, the large number of peasants possessing gift-land allot-ments. 
 “Evidently such peasants, who are relatively worse off materially and are not worried about their all toomeagre property, more frequently fail to carry out the obli-gations they undertake and in general more readily leave for other gubernias, even when they could find plenty of employment at home. 
” “Such peasants, having little attach-ment (sic!) to their own inadequate allotments, andsometimes not even possessing implements, more readilyabandon their homes and go to seek their fortunes far fromtheir native villages, without troubling about employment locally, and sometimes even about obligations undertaken, since they have nothing on which distraint can be made”(ibid. 
). 
 “Little attachment!” That’s just the term. 
It should give food for thought to those who talk about the disadvantages of “peregrination” and the preferableness of local “occupations close at hand”! * *Here is another example of the pernicious influence of Narodnik prejudices. 
 Mr. 
 Tezyakov, whose splendid work we have frequently quoted, notes the fact that from Kherson Gubernia many local workers go to that of Taurida, although there is a great shortage of labour inthe former gubernia. 
 He calls this “an extremely queer phenomenon”:it means a loss to the employers and a loss to the workers, who aban-don jobs at home and risk finding none in Taurida” (33). 
 We, on thecontrary, think that Mr. 
 Tezyakov’s statement is extremely queer. 
 Do the workers really not understand what is to their advantage, 3) “Peregrinations” mean creating mobility of the popu-lation. 
 Peregrinations are one of the most important factors preventing the peasants from “gathering moss,” of which more than enough has been fastened on them by history. 
 Unlessthe population becomes mobile, it cannot develop, and itwould be naïve to imagine that a village school can teachpeople what they can learn from an independent acquaint-ance with the different relations and orders of things in the South and in the North, in agriculture and in industry, in the capital and in the backwoods. 
 -and have they not the right to seek the most advantageous conditions of employment they can get? (In Taurida Gubernia the wages ofagricultural workers are higher than in Kherson Gubernia. 
) Are wereally to think that it is obligatory for the muzhik to live and work where he is registered and “provided with an allotment”? C H A P T E R IV THE GROWTH OF AGRICULTURE Having examined the internal economic structure of peasant and landlord economy, we must now take up thequestion of the changes in agricultural production and ask: do these changes express a growth of capitalism and of the home market? I. 
 GENERAL DATA ON AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION IN POST-REFORM RUSSIA AND ON THE TYPES OF AGRICULTURE Let us glance first of all at the general statistics on grain production in European Russia. 
 The considerable harvestfluctuations render the data for individual periods or forindividual years quite useless. 
 * It is necessary to take dif-ferent periods and the data for a whole number of years. 
 We have at our disposal the following data: for the period ofthe 60s, the data for 1864-1866 ( Military Statistical Abstract , IV, St. 
 Petersburg, 1871, data of gubernatorial reports). 
 For the 70s, the returns of the Department of Ag-riculture for the entire decade ( Historico-Statistical Survey of Russian Industry , Vol. 
 I, St. 
 Petersburg, 1883). 
 And last-ly, for the 1880s, we have data for the five years of 1883-1887 ( Statistics of the Russian Empire , IV); this five-year period can represent the whole of the eighties, since the aver-age harvest for the ten years, 1880-1889, is even some-what higher than for the five years 1883-1887 (see Agricul-*If only for this reason, Mr. 
 N. 
 —on is absolutely wrong in draw-ing the boldest conclusions from the returns for 8 years of one decade(1871-1878)! ture and Forestry in Russia , published for the Chicago Exhibition, pp. 
 132 and 142). 
 Further, in order to judge of the trend of evolution in the 90s we take the data for the decade 1885-1894 ( Productive Forces , I, 4). 
 Lastly, the data for 1905 ( Yearbook of Russia , 1906) are quite adequate for a judge-ment of the present time. 
 The 1905 harvest was only a littlelower than the average for the five years 1900-1904. 
 Let us compare all these data.

68 We see from this that until the 1890s the post-Reform era is characterised by an undoubted increase in the produc-tion both of cereals and potatoes. 
 The productivity ofagricultural labour rises: firstly, the size of the net yieldgrows faster than that of the sown area (with occasionalexceptions); secondly, we must bear in mind that the propor-tion of the population engaged in agricultural production steadily diminished during this period owing to the diversion of the population from agriculture to commerce andindustry, and also owing to the migration of peasants beyondthe bounds of European Russia. 
 ** What is particularly *For the period 1883-1887 we have taken the population of 1885; the increase is taken at 1. 
2%. 
 The difference between the data of thegubernatorial reports and those of the Department of Agriculture is,as we know, inconsiderable. 
 The figures for 1905 have been arrivedat by converting poods into chetverts (about six bushels each. 
— Ed. 
) **Mr. 
 N. 
 —on is quite wrong when he asserts that “there are no grounds whatever for assuming a decline in their number” (the numberof persons engaged in agricultural production), “quite the contrary”( Sketches , 33, note). 
 See Chapter VIII, §II. 
Population(both sexes,millions) noteworthy is the fact that it is commercial agriculture that is growing: there is an increase in the amount of grain gath-ered (after subtracting seed) per head of the population, while among this population there is an ever-growingdivision of social labour; there is an increase in the commer-cial and industrial population; the agricultural populationsplits up into rural entrepreneurs and a rural proletariat;there is an extension of specialisation in agriculture itself, so that the amount of grain produced for sale grows far more rapidly than the total amount of grain produced inthe country. 
 The capitalist character of the process is strik-ingly illustrated by the increased share of potatoes in thetotal agricultural production. 
 * The increase in the area under potatoes signifies, on the one hand, an improvement in agricultural technique (the introduction of root-crops) and increased technical processing of agricultural produce(distilling and the manufacture of potato starch). 
 On theother hand, it is, from the viewpoint of the rural entrepre-neur class, the production of relative surplus-value (cheap-ening of the cost of maintaining labour-power, deterioration of the people’s nourishment). 
 The data for the decade 1885-1894 show further that the crisis of 1891-1892, which tre-mendously intensified the expropriation of the peasantry,led to a considerable reduction in the output of cereals andto a reduction in the yield of all crops; but the process ofthe displacement of cereals by potatoes continued with such force that the per-capita output of potatoes increased, not-withstanding the reduced yield. 
 Finally, the last five years(1900-1904) also show an increase in agricultural produc-tion, an increase in the productivity of agricultural labour *The net per-capita potato crop increased between 1864-1866 and 1870-1879 in all areas of European Russia without exception. 
Between 1870-1879 and 1883-1887 the increase took place in 7 areasout of 11 (the Baltic, Western, Industrial, North-Western, Northern,Southern, Steppe, Lower- and Transvolga areas). 
 Cf. 
 Agricultural Statistical Information Based on Material Obtained from Farmers , Vol. 
 VII, St. 
 Petersburg, 1897 (published by Min-istry of Agriculture). 
94 In 1871, in the 50 gubernias of European Russia, the area under potatoes was 790,000 dess. 
 in 1881—1,375,000dess. 
 and in 1895—2,154,000 dess, i. 
e. 
, an increase during the 15years of 55%. 
 Taking the potato crop in 1841 as 100, we get the follow-ing figures for the later years: 1861—120; 1871—162; 1881—297; 1895—530. 
 and a worsening of the conditions of the working-class (increase in the part played by potatoes). 
 As we have noted above, the growth of commercial agriculture manifests itself in the specialisation ofagriculture. 
 Mass-scale and gross data on the production of allcrops can give (and then not always) only the most generalindications of this process, since the specific features ofthe different areas thereby disappear. 
 Yet it is precisely the segregation of the different agricultural areas that is one of the most characteristic features of post-Reform agri-culture in Russia. 
 Thus, the Historico-Statistical Survey of Russian Industry (Vol. 
 I, St. 
 Petersburg, 1883), quoted by us, enumerates the following agricultural areas:the flax area, “the region where stock farming predominates,” and where, in particular, “dairy farming is considerably developed”; the region where grain crops predominate, particu-larly the three-field area and the area with the improvedfallow or multi-field grass system (part of the steppe belt,which “is characterised by the production of the most valu-able, so-called élite grains, mainly intended for the foreign market”); the beet area, and the area in which potatoes are cultivated for distilling purposes. 
 “The economic areasindicated have arisen in European Russia comparativelyrecently, and with every passing year continue increasinglyto develop and become more segregated” (loc. 
 cit. 
, p. 
 15). 
 * Our task should now be, consequently, to study this process of the specialisation of agriculture, and we should ascertain whether a growth of commercial agriculture is to be observedin its various forms, whether capitalist agriculture comesinto existence in the process, and whether agricultural capi-talism bears the features we indicated above in analysingthe general data on peasant and landlord farming. 
 It goes without saying that for our purposes it will be sufficient if we confine ourselves to describing the principal areas of commercial agriculture. 
 *Cf. 
 also Agriculture and Forestry in Russia , pp. 
 84-88; here a tobacco area is added. 
 The maps drawn by Messrs. 
 D. 
 Semyonov andA. 
 Fortunatov show the areas according to the particular crops pre-dominating in them; for example the rye, oat and flax area, Pskov and Yaroslavl gubernias; the rye, oat and potato area, Grodno and Moscow gubernias, and so on. 
 But before examining the data for the separate areas, let us note the following: the Narodnik economists, as we have seen, do all they can to evade the fact that the charac-teristic feature of the post-Reform period is the growth ofcommercial agriculture. 
 Naturally, in doing so they alsoignore the circumstance that the drop in grain prices isbound to stimulate the specialisation of agriculture and thedrawing of agricultural produce into the sphere of exchange. 
 Here is an instance. 
 The authors of the well-known book The Influence of Harvests and Grain Prices all proceed from the postulate that the price of grain is of no importance tonatural economy, and they repeat this “truism” endlessly. 
One of them, Mr. 
 Kablukov, has observed, however, thatunder the general conditions of commodity production this postulate is substantially wrong. 
 “It is possible, of course,” he writes, “that the grain placed on the market has cost lessto produce than that grown on the consumer’s farm, inwhich case it would appear to be in the interest also of the consuming farm to change from cultivating cereals to other crops” (or to other occupations, we would add), “and, consequently, for it too the market price of grain assumesimportance as soon as it fails to coincide with its cost of production” (I, 98, note, author’s italics). 
 “But we cannot take that into account,” he says peremptorily. 
 Why is that?Because, it seems: 1) a change-over to other crops is possible“only where certain conditions exist. 
” By means of this empty truism (everything on earth is possible only under cer-tain conditions!) Mr. 
 Kablukov calmly evades the fact thatthe post-Reform period in Russia has created, and con-tinues to create, the very conditions that call forthe specialisation of agriculture and the diversion ofthe population from agriculture. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 2) Because “in our climate it is impossible to find a crop equal to cereals in food value”. 
 The argument is highly original, expressing a mereevasion of the issue. 
 What has the food value of other crops to do with the matter, if we are dealing with the sale of these other crops and the purchase of cheap grain? . 
 . 
 . 
3) Because “grain farms of the consuming type always have a rational basis for their existence. 
” In other words, because Mr. 
 Kablukov “and colleagues” regard natural economy as“rational. 
” The argument, as you see, is irrefutable. 
 . 
 .

 II. 
 THE GRAIN-FARMING AREA This area covers the outer region in the south and the east of European Russia, the steppe gubernias of Novorossiaand the Transvolga. 
 Agriculture is distinguished here forits extensive character and the enormous scale of the produc-tion of grain for sale. 
 If we take the eight gubernias ofKherson, Bessarabia, Taurida, Don, Ekaterinoslav, Saratov, Samara and Orenburg, we shall find that in 1883-1887 the net crop of cereals (not including oats) for a populationof 13,877,000 amounted to 41. 
3 million chetverts,i. 
e. 
, more than one-fourth of the total net yield of the 50gubernias of European Russia. 
 The crop most commonlysown here is wheat—the principal export grain. 
 * Agricul-ture develops here fastest of all (by comparison with the other areas of Russia), and these gubernias relegate thecentral black-earth gubernias, formerly in the lead, to thebackground: Thus there is a shifting of the principal centre of grain production: in the 1860s and 1870s the central black-earthgubernias were ahead of all the rest, but in the 1880s theyyielded priority to the steppe and Lower Volga gubernias: their production of grain began to diminish . 
 This interesting fact of the enormous growth of agricul-tural production in the area described is to be explainedby the circumstance that in the post-Reform period theouter steppe regions have been colonies of the central, long-settled part of European Russia. 
 The abundance of free land has attracted an enormous stream of settlers, who *Except for Saratov Gubernia, with 14. 
3% under wheat, in the rest of the gubernias mentioned we find 37. 
6% to 57. 
8% under wheat.

 Areas of gubernias according to Histor-ico-Statistical Survey . 
 The “Lower Volga and Transvolga area is badly constituted, for to the steppe gubernias, with their enormousproduction of grain, have been added that of Astrakhan (lacking grain for its food requirements) and of Kazan and of Simbirsk, which should more appropriately be included in the central black-earth belt.

28 have quickly increased the area under crops. 
 * The exten-sive development of commercial crops was possible only because of the close economic ties of these colonies withcentral Russia, on the one hand, and the European grain-importing countries, on the other. 
 The development of industry in central Russia and the development of commercialfarming in the outer regions are inseparably connected and create a market for each other. 
 The industrial gubernias received grain from the South, selling there the products oftheir factories and supplying the colonies with labour, artisans (see Chapter V, §III on the migration of small indus-trialists to the outer regions), and means of production(timber, building materials, tools, etc. 
). 
 Only because of this social division of labour could the settlers in the steppe localities engage exclusively in agriculture and sell huge quan-tities of grain in the home and particularly in the foreign market. 
 Only because of their close connection with the home and foreign markets could the economicdevelopment of these localities proceed so rapidly; and it was precisely capitalist development, for along with the growth of commercial farming there was an equally rapid processof the diversion of the population into industry, the process of the growth of towns and of the formation of new centres of large-scale industry (see below, Chapters VII and VIII). 
 ** *See Mr. 
 V. 
 Mikhailovsky’s material ( Novoye Slovo , [New Word ], June 1897) on the enormous increase in the population of the outerregions and on the migration to these parts, from 1885 to 1897, ofhundreds of thousands of peasants from the interior gubernias. 
 Onthe increase in the area under crops, see the above-mentioned work by V. 
 Postnikov, the Zemstvo statistical returns for Samara Gubernia; Grigoryev’s Peasant Migration from Ryazan Gubernia . 
 On Ufa Gubernia, see Remezov’s Sketches of the Life of Wild Bashkiria —a vivid description of how the “colonisers” felled timber for shipbuildingand transformed the fields “cleared” of “wild” Bashkirs into “wheatfactories. 
” This is a sample of colonial policy that bears comparison with any of the Germans’ exploits in a place like Africa. 
 **Cf. 
 Marx, Das Kapital , III, 2, 289,—one of the basic features of the capitalist colony is abundance of free land easily accessible tosettlers (the Russian translation of this passage, p. 
 623, is quite wrong).

 Russ. 
 trans. 
, p. 
 553,—the enormous grain surplusin the agricultural colonies is to be explained by the fact that their entire population is at first “almost exclusively engaged in farming, and particularly in producing agricultural mass products,” which As to the question of whether the growth of commercial farming in this area is bound up with technical progress in agriculture and with the creation of capitalist relations,that has been dealt with above. 
 In Chapter II we saw how large the areas cultivated by peasants in these localities are and how sharply capitalist relations manifestthemselves there even within the village community. 
 In the preceding chapter we saw that in this area there has been a particularly rapid development in the use of machinery,that the capitalist farms in the outer regions attract hun-dreds of thousands and millions of wage-workers, with huge farms created on a scale unprecedented in agriculture, onwhich there is extensive co-operation of wage-workers, etc. 
 We have little left now to add in completion of this picture. 
 In the outer steppe regions the privately-owned estates are not only distinguished occasionally for their enormous size, but are also the scene of farming on a very big scale. 
Above we made reference to crop areas of 8, 10 and 15 thou-sand dessiatines in Samara Gubernia. 
 In Taurida Gubernia, Falz-Fein owns 200,000 dess. 
, Mordvinov 80,000 dess. 
; twoindividuals own 60,000 dess. 
 each, “and many proprietors have from 10,000 to 25,000 dessiatines” (Shakhovskoi, 42). 
 An idea of the scale of farming can be obtained, for example,from the fact that in 1893 there were 1,100 machines (ofwhich 1,000 belonged to the peasantry) haymaking for Falz-Fein. 
 In Kherson Gubernia there were 3. 
3 million dessia-tines under cultivation in 1893, of which 1. 
3 million dess. 
 belonged to private owners; in five uyezds of the gubernia (without Odessa Uyezd) there were 1,237 medium-sized farms (250 to 1,000 dess. 
 of land), 405 big farms (1,000 to 2,500 dess. 
) and 226 farms each of over 2,500 dess. 
 According to data gathered in 1890 on 526 farms, they employed 35,514 work-ers, i. 
e. 
, an average of 67 workers per farm, of whom from 16 to 30 were annual labourers. 
 In 1893, 100 more or less big farms in Elisavetgrad Uyezd employed 11,197 workers (an average of 112 per farm!), of whom 17. 
4% were annual, are exchanged for industrial products “They [the colonial states] receive through the world market finished products ... which they would have to produce themselves under other circumstances. 
”96 39. 
5% seasonal, and 43. 
1% day labourers.

 Lastly, here are the data for Novouzensk Uyezd, Samara Gubernia. 
 In Chapter II we took only Russian peasants farm-ing community allotments; now we add Germans and farm-stead peasants (those farming non-community holdings). 
Unfortunately no data are available for the farms of pri-vate landowners.

 We have had occasion to observe that the area described is the most typical of agricultural capitalism in Rus-sia—typical not in the agricultural sense, of course, but inthe social-economic sense. 
 These colonies, having developedwith the greatest freedom, show us what relations could andshould have developed in the rest of Russia, had not thenumerous survivals of pre-Reform life retarded the development of capitalism. 
 The forms, however, of agricultural capitalism, as will be seen from what follows, are extremely varied. 
 III. 
 THE STOCK-FARMING AREA. 
 GENERAL DATA ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF DAIRY FARMING We now pass to another very important area of agricul-tural capitalism in Russia, namely, the region in which not cereal, but livestock produce is of predominant significance. 
This region embraces, apart from the Baltic and the westerngubernias, the northern, the industrial and parts of someof the central gubernias (Ryazan, Orel, Tula, and Nizhni-Novgorod). 
 Here animals are kept for dairy produce, and the whole character of agriculture is adapted to obtaining as large a quantity as possible of the more valuable marketHouseholdspurchased rented Area cultivated Animals (total, interms of cattle) Improved agriculturalimplements Employed workerspurchased rented Area culti-vated Animals (total, interms of cattle) produce of this sort. 
 * “Before our very eyes a marked tran-sition is taking place from stock farming for manure to stockfarming for dairy produce; it has been particularly notice-able during the past ten years” (work quoted in previousfootnote, ibid. 
). 
 It is very difficult by the use of statisticsto describe the various regions of Russia in this respect,because it is not the total number of horned cattle that is hereimportant, but the number of dairy cattle and their quality. 
If we take the total number of animals per hundred inhab-itants, we shall find that it is biggest in the outer stepperegions of Russia and smallest in the non-black-earth belt(Agriculture and Forestry , 274); we shall find that as time goes on the number diminishes (Productive Forces , III, 6. 
 Cf. 
 Historico-Statistical Survey , I). 
 Hence, we observe here what Roscher noted in his day, namely, that the number ofanimals per unit of the population is largest in districtsof “extensive livestock farming” (W. 
 Roscher, National-oekonomik des Ackerbaues . 
 7-te Aufl. 
, Stuttg. 
, 1873, S. 
 563-564 **). 
 We, however, are interested in intensive livestock farming, and in dairy farming in particular. 
 We are com-pelled, therefore, to confine ourselves to the approximate computation made by the authors of the above-mentioned, Sketch , without claiming to make an exact estimate of the phenomenon; such a computation clearly illustrates therelative positions of the various regions of Russia as todegree of dairy-farm development. 
 We quote this computationin extenso, supplementing it with some averages arrived atand data on the cheese-making industry in 1890 accordingto “factory” statistics. 
 *In other parts of Russia stock farming is of a different kind. 
 For example, in the extreme South and South-East, the most exten-sive form of stock farming has become established, namely, cattle-fattening for beef. 
 Further north, horned cattle are used as draught animals. 
 Lastly, in the central black-earth belt cattle are used as“manure-making machines. 
” V. 
 Kovalevsky and I. 
 Levitsky, Sta-tistical Sketch of Dairy Farming in the Northern and Central Belts of European Russia (St. 
 Petersburg, 1879). 
 The authors of this work, like the majority of agricultural experts, display very little interest in the social-economic aspect of the matter or understanding of this aspect It is quite wrong, for example, to draw from the fact of farmsbecoming more profitable the direct conclusion that they ensure “the people’s well-being and nutriment” (p. 
 2).

 To judge the development of dairy farming, we can only make use of data on butter production and cheesemaking. 
 This industry arose in Russia at the very end of the 18th century (1795); cheese making on landlords’ estates began to develop in the 19th century, but suffereda severe crisis in the 1860s, which opened the period ofcheese making by peasants and merchants. 
 The number of cheese-making establishments in the 50 gubernias of European Russia was as follows: * In 1866 72 with 226 workersand output valued at 119,000 rbs . 
 ”1879 108 ” 289 ”” ” ” ” 225,000 ” ”1890 265 ” 865 ”” ” ” ” 1,350,000 ” Thus, in 25 years production increased more than ten-fold; only the dynamics of the phenomenon may be judgedfrom these data, which are extremely incomplete. 
 Let usquote some more detailed material. 
 In Vologda Gubernia an improvement in dairy farming began, properly speaking, in 1872, when the Yaroslavl-Vologda railway was opened;since then “farmers have begun to see to the improvement oftheir herds, to introduce grass cultivation, to acquireimproved implements . 
 . 
 . 
 and have tried to place dairyfarming on a purely commercial basis” ( Statistical Sketch , *Data from Military Statistical Abstract and Mr. 
 Orlov’s Directory (1st and 3rd eds. 
). 
 Concerning these sources, see Chapter VII. 
 Let us merely observe that the figures quoted minimise the actual rapidity of development, since the term “factory” or “works” wasemployed in a narrower sense in 1879 than in 1866; and in 1890 in astill narrower sense than in 1879. 
 The 3rd ed of the Directory con-tains information on the date of establishment of 230 factories; itappears that only 26 were established before 1870, 68 in the 70s, 122 in the 80s and 14 in 1890. 
 This speaks of a rapid increase in pro-duction. 
 As for the latest List of Factories and Works (St. 
 Petersburg, 1897), utter chaos reigns there: cheese making is registered for two or three gubernias and for the rest omitted altogether . 
 20). 
 In Yaroslavl Gubernia “the ground was prepared” by the so-called “cheese-making artels” of the 70s, and “cheese making continues to develop on the basis of private enter-prise, merely retaining the title of ‘artel’” (25); cheese-making “artels” figure—may we add—in the Directory of Factories and Works as establishments employing wage-workers. 
 Instead of 295,000 rubles, the authors of the Sketch estimate the output of cheese and butter, according to official returns, at 412,000 rubles (computed from figures scattered throughout the book); correction of the figurebrings the value of the output of fresh butter and cheeseto 1,600,000 rubles, and if we add clarified butter and softcheese, to 4,701,400 rubles, not counting either the Balticor the western gubernias. 
 For the later period let us quote the following opinions from the above-cited publication of the Department ofAgriculture Hired Labour , etc. 
 Concerning the industrial gubernias in general we read: “A complete revolution in theposition of the farms in this area has been brought aboutby the development of dairy farming”; it “indirectly has also helped to bring about an improvement in agriculture”; “dairy farming in the area is developing with every year”(258). 
 In Tver Gubernia “there is to be observed the tend-ency both among private landowners and peasants toimprove the methods of maintaining cattle”; the income fromstock farming is estimated at 10 million rubles (274). 
 In Yaroslavl Gubernia “dairy farming . 
 . 
 . 
 is developing with every year. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 Cheese and butter making have even begun toassume something of an industrial character . 
 . 
 . 
 milk . 
 . 
 . 
 isbought up from neighbours and even from peasants. 
 Onecomes across cheese factories run by a whole company ofowners” (285). 
 “The general trend of private-landowner farming here,” writes a correspondent from Danilov Uyezd, Yaroslavl Gubernia, “is marked at the present time by thefollowing: 1) the transition from three-field to five-and sev-en-field crop rotation, with the sowing of herbage in thefields; 2) the ploughing up of disused lands; 3) the introduc-tion of dairy farming, and as a consequence, the stricter selection of cattle and an improvement in their maintenance” (292). 
 The same thing is said of Smolensk Gubernia, wherethe value of the output of cheese and butter amounted to 240,000 rubles in 1889—according to a report of the Gover-nor (according to statistical returns, 136,000 rubles in 1890). 
 The development of dairy farming is noted in the Kaluga, Kovno, Nizhni-Novgorod, Pskov, Esthland andVologda gubernias. 
 The value of the output of butter andcheese in the last-mentioned gubernia was estimated at35,000 rubles according to statistics for 1890, to 108,000rubles according to the Governor’s report, and to 500,000 rubles according to local returns for 1894, which gave a total of 389 factories . 
 “That is what the statistics say. 
 Actually, however, there are far more factories, since, according toinvestigations by the Vologda Zemstvo Board, thereare 224 factories in Vologda Uyezd alone. 
” Production isdeveloped in three uyezds, and has partly penetrated a fourth. 
 * One can judge from this how many times the above-quoted figures need to be multiplied in order to approachthe real situation. 
 The plain view of an expert that at thepresent time the number of butter and cheese-making estab-lishments “amounts to several thousand” ( Agriculture and Forestry in Russia , 299), gives a truer picture of the facts than the allegedly exact figure of 265. 
 Thus the data leave not the slightest doubt about the enormous development of this special type of commercialfarming. 
 The growth of capitalism was accompanied heretoo by the transformation of routine technique. 
 “In thesphere of cheese making,” we read, for example, in Agri-culture and Forestry , “more has been done in Russia during the last 25 years than perhaps in any other country” (301). 
Mr. 
 Blazhin says the same thing in his article “TechnicalProgress in Dairy Farming” ( Productive Forces , III, 38-45). 
 The principal change is that the “age-old” method of leav-ing cream to settle has been replaced by the system of *Nedelya [Week ], 1896, No. 
 13. 
 Dairy farming is so profitable that urban traders have rushed into the business and, incidentally,have introduced such methods as the settlement of accounts in goods. 
 One local landowner, who has a large factory, organised an artel “with prompt cash payment for milk” in order to release the peasantsfrom bondage to buyers-up and to “capture new markets. 
” A char-acteristic example, showing the real significance of artels and of the celebrated “organisation of sales,” namely, “emancipation” frommerchant’s capital through the development of industrial capital. 
 separating cream in centrifugal machines (separators); * The machine has enabled the work to be carried on irrespective of atmospheric temperature, increased the butter yield from milk by 10%, improved the quality of the product, reducedthe cost of butter production (the machine requires lesslabour, space, and ice, as well as fewer utensils), and has ledto the concentration of production. 
 Large peasant butterieshave grown up, handling “as much as 500 poods of milk a day, which was physically impossible . 
 . 
 . 
 when the milk was left to settle” (ibid. 
). 
 Improvements are being made inthe instruments of production (permanent boilers, screwpresses, improved cellars), and production is being assistedby bacteriology, which is providing pure cultures of the typeof lactic-acid bacilli needed for fermenting cream. 
 Thus, in the two areas of commercial farming we have described, the technical improvements called into being bythe requirements of the market were effected primarily inthose operations that were easiest to change and are partic-ularly important for the market: reaping, threshing andwinnowing in commercial grain farming, and the technical processing of animal produce in the area of commercial stock farming. 
 As to the keeping of cattle, capital finds itmore profitable for the time being to leave that to the smallproducer: let him “diligently” and “industriously” tend “his”cattle (and charm Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
 with his diligence—see Pro-gressive Trends , p. 
 73), let him bear the brunt of the hardest and roughest work of tending the milk-yielding machine. 
 Capital possesses the latest improvements and methods notonly of separating the cream from the milk, but also ofseparating the “cream” from this “diligence”, of separatingthe milk from the children of the peasant poor. 
 IV. 
 CONTINUATION. 
 THE ECONOMY OF LANDLORD FARMING IN THE AREA DESCRIBED We have cited the evidence of agronomists and farmers to the effect that dairy farming on the landlordestates leads to the rationalisation of agriculture. 
 Let us *Until 1882 there were hardly any separators in Russia. 
 From 1886 onward they spread so rapidly as to displace the old methodutterly. 
 In the 1890s even butter-extractor separators appeared. 
 add here that the analysis of the Zemstvo statistics on this question made by Mr. 
 Raspopin * fully confirms this con-clusion. 
 We refer the reader to Mr. 
 Raspopin’s article fordetailed data and give here only his main conclusion. 
 “The interdependence of the condition of stock raising and dairy farming, on the one hand, and the number of dilapidatedestates and the intensity of farming, on the other, is beyond question. 
 The uyezds (of Moscow Gubernia) where dairy cattle raising, dairy farming, is most developed show thesmallest percentage of dilapidated farms and the highest percentage of estates with highly developed field cultiva-tion. 
 Throughout Moscow Gubernia ploughland is beingreduced and turned into meadow and pastureland, while grain rotations are yielding place to multi-field herbage rotations. 
 Fodder grasses and dairy cattle, and not grain,are now predominant . 
 . 
 . 
 not only on the farming estates in Moscow Gubernia but throughout the Moscow industrial district” (loc. 
 cit. 
). 
 The scale of butter production and cheese making is particularly important precisely because it testifies to a com-plete revolution in agriculture, which becomes entrepre-neur farming and breaks with routine. 
 Capitalism subor-dinates to itself one of the products of agriculture, and all other aspects of farming are fitted in with this principalproduct. 
 The keeping of dairy cattle calls forth the culti-vation of grasses, the change-over from the three-field system to multi-field systems, etc. 
 The waste products of cheesemaking go to fatten cattle for the market. 
 Not only milk processing, but the whole of agriculture becomes a commer-cial enterprise. 
 ** The influence of cheese production and *This problem also has been raised by Mr. 
 Raspopin (perhaps for the first time in our literature) from the correct, theoretically sound point of view. 
 At the very outset he observes that “the enhance-ment of the productivity of stock farming—in particular, thedevelopment of dairy farming—is proceeding in this country alongcapitalist lines and serves as one of the most important indices of the penetration of capital into agriculture. 
 **Dr. 
 Zhbankov says in his Sanitary Investigation of Factories and Works of Smolensk Gubernia (Smolensk, 1894, Vol. 
 I, p. 
 7) that “the number of workers engaged in cheese making proper ... is veryinconsiderable.... 
 There are far more auxiliary workers, needed bothfor cheese making and for agriculture; these are herdsmen, milkmaids, butter making is not confined to the farms on which they are carried on, since milk is often bought up from the surrounding peasants and landlords. 
 By buying up the milk, capitalsubordinates to itself the small agriculturists too, partic-ularly with the organisation of the so-called “amalgamated dairies,” the spread of which was noted in the 70s (see Sketch by Messrs. 
 Kovalevsky and Levitsky). 
 These are establishments organised in big towns, or in their vicinity, which process very large quantities of milk brought in byrail. 
 As soon as the milk arrives the cream is skimmed and sold fresh, while the skimmed milk is sold at a low price to poorer purchasers. 
 To ensure that they get produce of acertain quality, these establishments sometimes conclude contracts with the suppliers, obliging them to adhere to certain rules in feeding their cows. 
 One can easily see howgreat is the significance of large establishments of this kind: on the one hand they capture the public market (the sale of skimmed milk to the poorer town-dwellers), and on theother hand they enormously expand the market for the rural entrepreneurs. 
 The latter are given a tremendous impetus to expand and improve commercial farming. 
 Large-scale industry brings them into line, as it were, by demanding produce of a definite quality and forcing out of the market (or placing at the mercy of the usurers) the smallproducer who falls below the “normal” standard. 
 There should also operate in the same direction the grading of milk as to quality (fat content, for example), on which tech-nicians are so busily engaged, inventing all sorts of lacto-densimeters, etc. 
, and of which the experts are so heartily in favour (cf. 
 Productive Forces , III, 9 and 38). 
 In this respect the role of the amalgamated dairies in the develop-ment of capitalism is quite analogous to that of elevators in commercial grain farming. 
 By sorting grain as to quality the elevators turn it into a product that is not individual etc. 
; in all the [cheese] factories these workers outnumber the cheese makers proper, two, three and even four times over. 
” Let us note inpassing that according to Dr. 
 Zhbankov’s description, the conditions of labour here are very insanitary, and the working day is excessively long (16 to 17 hours), etc. 
 Thus, in the case of this area of commercialagriculture, too, the traditional notion of the idyllic occupation ofthe agriculturist is a false one. 
 but generic (res fungibilis,97 as the lawyers say), i. 
e. 
, for the first time they adapt it fully to exchange (cf. 
 M. 
 Ser-ing’s article on the grain trade in the United States of America in the symposium Landownership and Agriculture , p. 
 281 and foll. 
). 
 Thus, the elevators give a powerful impetusto commodity-grain production and spur on its technicaldevelopment by also introducing grading for quality. 
 Sucha system strikes a double blow at the small producer. 
 Firstly, it sets up as a standard, legalises, the higher-quality grain of the big crop sowers and thereby greatly depreciates theinferior grain of the peasant poor. 
 Secondly, by organisingthe grading and storing of grain on the lines of large-scalecapitalist industry, it reduces the big sowers’ expenses onthis item and facilitates and simplifies the sale of grain for them, thereby placing the small producer, with his patriar-chal and primitive methods of selling from the cart in themarket, totally at the mercy of the kulaks and the usurers. 
Hence, the rapid development of elevator construction inrecent years means as big a victory for capital and degrada-tion of the small commodity-producer in the grain business as does the appearance and development of capitalist “amal-gamated dairies. 
” From the foregoing material it is clear that the devel-opment of commercial stock farming creates a home market, * firstly, for means of production—milk-processing equipment, premises, cattle sheds, improved agricultural implements required for the change-over from the routine three-field system to multi-field crop rotations, etc. 
; andsecondly, for labour-power. 
 Stock farming placed on anindustrial footing requires a far larger number of workers *The market for commercial stock farming is created chiefly by the growth of the industrial population, with which we shalldeal in detail later on (Chapter VIII, §II). 
 As regards foreign trade,let us confine ourselves to the following remarks: cheese exports inthe early part of the post-Reform period were much below imports; but in the 90s they almost equalled them (for the 4 years 1891-1894, the annual average imports amounted to 41,800 poods, and exportsto 40,600 poods; in the five years 1886-1890, exports even exceededimports). 
 The exports of cow and ewe butter have always greatlyexceeded imports; these exports are rapidly increasing: in 1866-1870the average annual exports amounted to 190,000 poods and in 1891-1894 to 370,000 poods ( Productive Forces , III, 37). 
 /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR than the old stock farming “for manure. 
” The dairy farm-ing area—the industrial and north-western gubernias—does really attract masses of agricultural labourers. 
 Very many people go to seek agricultural work in the Moscow, St. 
 Peters-burg, Yaroslavl and Vladimir gubernias; fewer, but never-theless a considerable number, go to the Novgorod, Nizhni-Novgorod and other non-black-earth gubernias. 
 Accordingto correspondents of the Department of Agriculture in the Moscow and other gubernias private-landowner farming is actually conducted in the main by labourers from otherareas. 
 This paradox—the migration of agricultural workersfrom the agricultural gubernias (they come mostly from thecentral black-earth gubernias and partly from the north-ern) to the industrial gubernias to do agricultural jobs in place of industrial workers who abandon the area en masse—is an extremely characteristic phenomenon (seeS. 
 A. 
 Korolenko on this point, loc. 
 cit). 
 It proves moreconvincingly than do any calculations or arguments that thestandard of living and the conditions of the working peoplein the central black-earth gubernias, the least capitalist ones, are incomparably lower and worse than in the indus-trial gubernias, the most capitalist ones; it proves that inRussia, too, the following has become a universal fact,namely, the phenomenon characteristic of all capitalistcountries, that the conditions of the workers in industryare better than those of the workers in agriculture (because in agriculture oppression by capitalism is supplemented by the oppression of pre-capitalist forms of exploitation). 
That explains the flight from agriculture to industry,whereas not only is there no flow from the industrial guber-nias towards agriculture (for example, there is no migrationfrom these gubernias at all), but there is even a tendency to look down upon the “raw” rural workers, who are called “cow-herds” (Yaroslavl Gubernia), “cossacks” (Vladimir Guber-nia) and “land labourers” (Moscow Gubernia). 
 It is important also to note that cattle herding requires a larger number of workers in winter than in summer. 
 Forthat reason, and also because of the development of agricul-tural processing trades, the demand for labour in the area described not only grows, but is more evenly distributed over the whole year and over a period of years. 
 The most reliable material for judging this interesting fact is the data on wages, if taken for a number of years. 
 We give these data, confining ourselves to the groups of Great-Russian and Little-Russian gubernias. 
98 We omit the western gubernias, owing to their specific social conditions and artificialcongestion of population (the Jewish pale of settlement),and quote the Baltic gubernias only to illustrate the rela-tions that arise where capitalism is most highly developed.

 Petersburg, Novgorodand Pskov.

hired bythe year hired forthe summer summer pay, % ofyearly pay lowestaverage highestaverage Difference Duringsowing Averageduringharvesting Difference Let us examine this table, in which the three principal columns are printed in italics. 
 The first column shows the proportion of summer to yearly pay. 
 The lower this propor-tion is, and the nearer the summer pay approximates to halfthe yearly pay, the more evenly is the demand for labourspread over the entire year and the less the winter unemploy-ment . 
 The least favourably placed in this respect are the central black-earth gubernias—the area where labour-serviceprevails and where capitalism is poorly developed. 
 * In the industrial gubernias, in the dairy-farming area the demandfor labour is higher and winter unemployment is less. 
 Over a period of years, too, the pay is most stable here, as may be seen from the second column, which shows the differencebetween the lowest and the highest pay in the harvest season. 
 Lastly, the difference between the pay in the sowing season and the pay in the harvest season is also least in the non-black-earth belt, i. 
e. 
, the demand for workers is more evenly distributed over the spring and summer. 
 In all respects mentioned the Baltic gubernias stand even higher thanthe non-black-earth gubernias, while the steppe gubernias, with their immigrant workers and with harvest fluctuations of the greatest intensity, are marked by the greatest insta-bility of wages. 
 Thus, the data on wages testify that agricul-tural capitalism in the area described not only creates a demand for wage-labour, but also distributes this demandmore evenly over the whole year. 
 Lastly, reference must be made to one more type of dependence of the small agriculturist in the area describedupon the big farmer. 
 This is the replenishment of landlords’ herds by the purchase of cattle from peasants. 
 The landlords find it more profitable to buy cattle from peasants drivenby need to sell “at a loss” than to breed cattle themselves— just as our buyers-up in so-called handicraft industry often prefer to buy finished articles from the handicraftsmen at *A similar conclusion is drawn by Mr. 
 Rudnev: “In those local-ities where the work of labourers hired by the year is given a rela-tively high valuation the wages of the summer worker approximatemore closely to half the yearly pay. 
 Hence, on the contrary, in thewestern gubernias, and in nearly all the densely-populated central black-earth gubernias, the worker’s labour in the summer is given a very low valuation” (loc. 
 cit. 
, 455). 
 a ruinously cheap price rather than manufacture them in their own workshops. 
 This fact, which testifies to the extreme degradation of the small producer, and to his being able to keep going in modern society only by endlessly reducinghis requirements, is turned by Mr. 
 V.

 into an argumentin favour of small “people’s” production! . 
 . 
 . 
 “We are entitledto draw the conclusion that our big farmers . 
 . 
 . 
 do not dis-play a sufficient degree of independence. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 The peasant, however . 
 . 
 . 
 reveals greater ability to effect real farming improvements” ( Progressive Trends , 77). 
 This lack of independence is expressed in the fact that “our dairy farmers. 
 . 
 . 
 buy up the peasants’ (cows) at a price rarely amountingto half the cost of raising them—usually at not morethan a third, and often even a quarter of this cost” (ibid. 
, 71). 
 The merchant’s capital of the stock farmers has made the small peasants completely dependent, it has turnedthem into its cowherds, who breed cattle for a mere song,and has turned their wives into its milkmaids. 
 * One would think that the conclusion to be drawn from this is that there isno sense in retarding the transformation of merchant’s capital into industrial capital, no sense in supporting small production, which leads to forcing down the producer’sstandard of living below that of the farm labourer. 
 But *Here are two descriptions of the living standard and living conditions of the Russian peasant in general. 
 M. 
 Y. 
 Saltykov, in Petty Things of Life , writes about the “enterprising muzhik” as fol-lows: “The muzhik needs everything, but what he needs most of all ...is the ability to exhaust himself, not to stint his own labour.... 
 Theenterprising muzhik simply expires at it” (work). 
 “His wife and grownup children, too, all toil worse than galley-slaves. 
” V. 
 Veresayev, in a story entitled “Lizar” ( Severny Kurier [North-ern Courier ], 1899, No. 
 1), tells the story of a muzhik in the Pskov Gubernia named Lizar, who advocates the use of drops, etc. 
, “to pre-vent an increase. 
” “Subsequently,” observes the author, “I heard frommany Zemstvo doctors, and particularly from midwives, that theyfrequently have similar requests from village husbands and wives. 
 ” “Moving in a certain direction, life has tried all roads and at last hasreached a blind alley. 
 There is no escape from it. 
 And so a new solu-tion of the problem is naturally arising and increasingly maturing. 
” The position of the peasant in capitalist society is indeed hopeless, doom of small economy.

 solution of Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
 thinks otherwise. 
 He is delighted with the “zeal” (p. 
 73, loc. 
 cit. 
) of the peasant in tending his cattle; he is delighted with the “good results from livestock farming” obtained by the peasant woman who “spends all her lifewith her cow and sheep” (80). 
 What a blessing, to be sure!To “spend all her life with her cow” (the milk of whichgoes to the improved cream separator), and as a rewardfor this life, to receive “one-fourth of the cost” of tending this cow! Now really, how after that can one fail to declare in favour of “small people’s production”! V. 
 CONTINUATION. 
 THE DIFFERENTIATION OF THE PEASANTRY IN THE DAIRY-FARMING AREA In the literature dealing with the effect of dairy farm-ing on the conditions of the peasantry, we constantly comeup against contradictions: on the one hand reference ismade to progress in farming, the enlargement of incomes,the improvement of agricultural technique and the acquisi-tion of improved implements; on the other hand, we have statements about the deterioration of food, the creationof new types of bondage and the ruin of the peasants. 
 Afterwhat was stated in Chapter II, we should not be surprised atthese contradictions: we know that these opposite opinionsrelate to opposite groups of the peasantry. 
 For a more pre-cise judgement of the subject, let us take the data showing the classification of peasant households according to thenumber of cows per household. 
 * *Zemstvo statistics taken from Mr. 
 Blagoveshchensky’s Combined Returns . 
99 About 14,000 households in these 18 uyezds are not classified according to the number of cows owned: the total isnot 289,079 households, but 303,262. 
 Mr. 
 Blagoveshchensky citessimilar data for two other uyezds in the black-earth gubernias, butthese uyezds are evidently not typical. 
 In 11 uyezds of Tver Gubernia( Statistical Returns , XIII, 2) the percentage of allotment households owning no cows is not high (9. 
8), but 21. 
9% of the households, having 3 and more cows, concentrate in their hands 48. 
4% of the total numberof cows. 
 Horseless households constitute 12. 
2%; households with 3and more horses constitute only 5. 
1% and they own only 13. 
9% ofthe total number of horses. 
 Let us note, in passing, that a smallerconcentration of horses (as compared with that of cows) is also to be observed in other non-black-earth gubernias.

8 Thus, the distribution of cows among the peasants in the non-black-earth belt is found to be very similar to thedistribution of draught animals among the peasants in the black-earth gubernias (see Chapter II). 
 Moreover, the con-centration of dairy cattle in the area described proves tobe greater than the concentration of draught animals. 
 Thisclearly points to the fact that it is with the local form ofcommercial farming that the differentiation of the peasantryis closely connected. 
 The same connection is evidently indi-cated by the following data (unfortunately, not sufficiently complete). 
 If we take the aggregate Zemstvo statistics(given by Mr. 
 Blagoveshchensky; for 122 uyezds of 21 guber-nias), we get an average of 1. 
2 cows per household. 
Hence, in the non-black-earth belt the peasantry evidentlyown more cows than in the black-earth belt, and in Peters-burg Gubernia they are better off than in the non-black-earth belt in general. 
 On the other hand, in 123 uyezds of22 gubernias the cattleless households constitute 13%,while in the 18 uyezds we have taken, they amount to 17%,and in the 6 uyezds of Petersburg Gubernia 18. 
8%. 
 Hence,the differentiation of the peasantry (in the respect we are now examining) is most marked in Petersburg Gubernia, followed by the non-black-earth belt in general. 
 By thisindication, commercial farming is the principal factor in the differentiation of the peasantry. 
 The data show that about half the peasant households (those having no cows, or one cow) can take only aNo. 
 ofhouse-holds % No. 
 ofcows % Cows perhouseholdNo. 
 ofhouse-holds % No. 
 ofcows % Cows perhousehold negative part in the benefits of dairy farming. 
 The peasant with one cow will sell milk only out of need, to the detri-ment of his children’s nourishment. 
 On the other hand, about one-fifth of the households (those with 3 cows andmore) concentrate in their hands probably more than halfthe total dairy farming since the quality of their cattleand the profitableness of their farms should be higher thanin the case of the “average” peasant. 
 * An interesting illustra-tion of this conclusion is provided by the data on a locality where dairy farming and capitalism in general are highlydeveloped. 
 We refer to Petersburg Uyezd. 
 ** Dairy farming is particularly widely developed in the summer residentialpart of the uyezd, inhabited mainly by Russians; here themost widely cultivated crops are: grasses (23. 
5% of the allotment arable, as against 13. 
7% for the uyezd), oats (52. 
3% of the arable) and potatoes (10. 
1%). 
 Agriculture isdirectly influenced by the St. 
 Petersburg market, whichneeds oats, potatoes, hay, milk and horse traction (loc. 
cit. 
, 168). 
 The families of the registered population are46. 
3% engaged “in the milk industry. 
” Of the total number of cows 91% provide milk for the market. 
 The income from this industry amounts to 713,470 rubles (203 rubles perfamily, 77 rubles per cow). 
 The nearer the locality is to St. 
Petersburg, the higher is the quality of the cattle and thebetter the attention they receive. 
 The milk is sold in twoways: 1) to buyers-up on the spot and 2) in St. 
 Petersburg to “dairy farms,” etc. 
 The latter type of marketing is much *These data regarding the opposite groups of peasants should be borne in mind when one meets sweeping statements like the follow-ing: “An annual income from dairy stock farming ranging from 20to 200 rubles per household is, over the enormous area of the northerngubernias, not only a most considerable means of extending andimproving stock farming, but has also had the effect of improving fieldcultivation and even of reducing migration in search of employment, by providing the population with work at home—both in tending cattle and in bringing hitherto neglected land into a properly cultivatedcondition” ( Productive Forces , III, 18). 
 On the whole, migration is not decreasing, but increasing. 
 In some localities, however, thedecrease may be due either to the increase in the percentage of well-to-do peasants, or to the development of “work at home,” i. 
e. 
, work for local rural entrepreneurs.

 . 
 . 
 able to deliver their milk to St. 
 Petersburg direct”—they have no horses, it does not pay to cart small quantities, etc. 
 The buyers-upof the milk include not only specialist merchants, but indi-viduals with dairies of their own.

7 One can judge from this how the benefits of dairy farm-ing are distributed among all the peasants in the non-black-earth belt, among whom, as we have seen, the concentrationof dairy cattle is even greater than among these 560 families. 
It remains for us to add that 23. 
1% of the peasant familiesin St. 
 Petersburg Uyezd hire workers (most of whom, here, as everywhere in agriculture, are day labourers). 
 Bearing in mind that agricultural workers are hired almostexclusively by families having fully-operating farms”(constituting only 40. 
4% of the total number of familiesin the uyezd) “the conclusion must be that more than halfof such farms do not manage without hired labour” (158). 
 Thus, at opposite ends of Russia, in the most varying localities, in St. 
 Petersburg and, say, Taurida gubernias,the social and economic relations within the “villagecommunity,” prove to be absolutely identical. 
 The“muzhik-cultivators” (Mr. 
 N. 
 —on’s term) in both places differentiate into a minority of rural entrepreneurs and a mass of rural proletarians. 
 The specific feature of agriculture is that capitalism subjugates one aspect of rural economyNo. 
 offamilies No. 
 of cowsbelongingto them Cows perfamily “Earnings”of these fam-ilies (rubles) Per family Per cow in one district, and another aspect in another, which is why identical economic relations are manifested in the most varied forms of agronomy and everyday life. 
 Having established the fact that in the area described, too, the peasantry splits up into opposite classes, we shall easilyachieve clarity about the contradictory opinions usuallyexpressed as to the role of dairy farming. 
 Quite naturally,the well-to-do peasantry receive an incentive to develop and improve their farming methods and as a result grass culti-vation is widespread and becomes an essential part of com-mercial stock-farming. 
 The development of grass cultivationis observed, for example, in Tver Gubernia; in Kashin Uyezd,the most progressive in that gubernia, as many as one-sixthof all peasant households plant clover ( Returns , XIII, 2, p. 
 171). 
 It is interesting, moreover, to note that on the pur-chased lands a larger proportion of arable is occupied byherbage than on the allotments: the peasant bourgeoisienaturally prefer private ownership of land to communaltenure. 
 * In the Survey of Yaroslavl Gubernia (Vol. 
 II, 1896) we also find numerous references to the increase in grass cultivation, and again mainly on purchased and rented lands. 
 ** In the same publication we find references to the spread of improved implements: iron ploughs, threshingmachines, rollers, etc. 
 Butter and cheese making, etc. 
, aredeveloping very considerably. 
 In Novgorod Gubernia it wasnoted as far back as the beginning of the 80s that along with a general deterioration and diminution of peasant stock-breeding, there was an improvement in certain individuallocalities where there was a profitable market for milk andwhere the milk-feeding of calves was an old-establishedindustry (Bychkov: An Essay in the House-to-House Investi-gation of the Economic Position and Farming of the Peasants *A substantial improvement in the maintenance of cattle is observed only where there has been a development in the production of milk for sale (pp. 
 219, 224). 
 **Pp. 
 39, 65, 136, 150, 154, 167, 170, 177 and others. 
 Our pre-Reform system of taxation retards the progress of agriculture heretoo. 
 “Owing to the congestion of the farmsteads,” writes a correspond-ent, “grass cultivation has been introduced all over the volost; the clover, however, is sold to cover tax arrears (91). 
 The taxes in this gubernia are sometimes to high that the peasant who leases hisland has himself to pay a sum to the new holder of the allotment. 
 in Three Volosts of Novgorod Uyezd , Novgorod, 1882). 
 The milk-feeding of calves, which is also a type of commercial livestock farming, is, generally speaking, a fairly widespread industry in the Novgorod and Tver gubernias and in otherplaces not far from the big cities (see Hired Labour , etc. 
, published by the Department of Agriculture). 
 “This industry,”says Mr. 
 Bychkov, “by its very nature, brings an income tothe already well-provided peasants possessing considerable numbers of cows, since with one cow, and sometimes even with two of poor yield, the milk-feeding of calves is unthink-able” (loc. 
 cit. 
, 101). 
 * But the most outstanding index of the economic successes of the peasant bourgeoisie in the area described is the hiringof labourers by peasants. 
 The local landowners feel that they are being confronted by competitors, and in their communications to the Department of Agriculture they some-times even attribute the shortage of workers to the factthat these are snatched up by the well-to-do peasants ( Hired Labour , 490). 
 The hiring of labourers by peasants is noted in the Yaroslavl, Vladimir, St. 
 Petersburg and Novgorod gubernias (loc. 
 cit. 
, passim). 
 A mass of such references is also scattered throughout the Survey of Yaroslavl Gubernia . 
 This progress of the well-to-do minority, however, is a heavy burden upon the mass of the poor peasants. 
 InKoprin Volost, Rybinsk Uyezd, Yaroslavl Gubernia, forexample, one finds the spread of cheese making—on the initiative of “V. 
 I. 
 Blandov, the well-known founder of cheese-making artels. 
” ** “When the poorer peasants, with only one cow each, deliver . 
 . 
 . 
 their milk (to the cheese *Let us note, by the way, that the variety of “industries” of the local peasantry prompted Mr. 
 Bychkov to distinguish two types of industrialists, according to the amount of earnings. 
 It appearedthat less than 100 rubles was earned by 3,251 persons (27. 
4% of thepopulation); their earnings totalled 102,000 rubles, or an average of31 rubles per person. 
 Over 100 rubles was obtained by 454 (3. 
8%of the population): their earnings totalled 107,000 rubles, or an average of 236 rubles per person The first group consisted mainly of wage-workers of every kind, the second of traders, hay merchants,timber dealers, etc. 
 **The “cheese-making artels” of Koprin Volost are mentioned in the Directory of Factories and Works , and the Blandovs are the largest firm in the cheese-making industry: in 1890 they owned 25 factories factory) they do so, of course, to the detriment of their own nourishment”; whereas the well-to-do peasants improve their cattle (pp. 
 32-33). 
 Among the types of wage-labour undertaken, one finds employment away from home, atcheese-making establishments; from among the young peas-ants a body of skilled cheese makers is arising. 
 In thePoshekhonye Uyezd “the number . 
 . 
 . 
 of cheese and butter establishments is increasing from year to year,” but “the benefits accruing to peasant farming from cheese and butter making hardly compensate for the disadvantages to peasantlife resulting from our cheese and butter establishments. 
”On the peasants’ own admission they are often compelled tostarve, for with the opening of a cheese or butter factory insome locality, the milk is sent there and the peasants usually drink diluted milk. 
 The system of payment in kind is coming into vogue (pp. 
 43, 54, 59 and others), so that it is to be regrettedthat our “people’s” petty production is not covered bythe law prohibiting payment in kind in “capitalist” factories. 
 * Thus, the opinions of people directly acquainted with the matter confirm our conclusion that the majority of the peasants play a purely negative part in the progress of local agriculture. 
 The progress of commercial farmingworsens the position of the bottom groups of peasants andforces them out of the ranks of the cultivators altogether. 
Be it noted that reference has been made in Narodnik litera-ture to this contradiction between the progress of dairy *Here is the characteristic view of Mr. 
 Stary Maslodel [Old Butter Maker]: “Whoever has seen and knows the countryside today andremembers what it was 40 or 50 years ago will be amazed at the differ-ence. 
 In the old villages all the houses were the same both outsideand inside; today, however side by side with hovels stand fine houses, side by side with the indigent live the rich, side by side with the downtrodden and despised live those who feast and make merry. 
In former times one often came across villages in which there was nota single landless peasant; now in every village there are no less thanfive and sometimes a full dozen. 
 And to tell the truth, butter makingis much to blame for this transformation of the villages. 
 In 30 years butter making has enriched many, has beautified their homes; many peasants who supplied milk during the period of development of thebutter industry have become prosperous, acquired more cattle, andpurchased land on a community or individual basis; but many morehave fallen into poverty; landless peasants and beggars have appearedin the villages” ( Zhizn [Life ], 1899, No. 
 8 quoted from Severny Krai farming and the deterioration of the peasants’ nourishment (for the first time, I think, by Engelhardt). 
 But it is pre-cisely this example that enables one to see the narrowness of the Narodnik appraisal of the phenomena occurring amongthe peasantry and in agriculture. 
 They note a contradictionin one form, in one locality, and do not realise that it istypical of the entire social and economic system, manifest-ing itself everywhere in different forms. 
 They note the contradictory significance of one “profitable industry,” and strongly urge the “implanting” among the peasantry of allsorts of other “local industries. 
” They note the contradictorysignificance of one form of agricultural progress and donot understand that machines, for example, have exactlythe same political and economic significance in agriculture as in industry. 
 VI. 
 THE FLAX-GROWING AREA We have described the first two areas of capitalist agri-culture in fairly great detail because of their widespread character and of the typical nature of the relations observed there. 
 In our further exposition we shall confine ourselvesto briefer remarks on some highly important areas. 
 Flax is the chief of the so-called “industrial crops. 
” The very term indicates that we are dealing here with commer-cial farming. 
 For example, in the “flax” gubernia of Pskov, flax has long been the peasants’ “first money,” to use a local expression ( Military Statistical Abstract , 260). 
 Flax growing is simply a means of making money. 
 Thepost-Reform period is marked on the whole by an undoubtedincrease in commercial flax growing. 
 Thus, at the end ofthe 60s, the output of flax in Russia was estimated at approx-imately 12 million poods of fibre (ibid. 
, 260); at the begin-ning of the 80s at 20 million poods of fibre ( Historico-Statistical Survey of Russian Industry , Vol. 
 I, St. 
 Petersburg, 1883, p. 
 74); at the present time, in the 50 gubernias ofEuropean Russia over 26 million poods of fibre are gath-ered. 
 * In the flax-growing area proper (19 gubernias of the *The average for 1893-1897 was 26,291,000 poods, according to the figures of the Central Statistical Committee. 
 See Vestnik Finansov , 1897, No. 
 9, and 1898, No. 
 6. 
 Formerly the statistics for flax produc-non-black-earth belt) the area under flax has changed in recent years as follows; 1893—756,600 dess. 
; 1894—816,500 dess. 
; 1895—901,800 dess. 
; 1896—952,100 dess. 
, and 1897— 967,500 dess. 
 For the whole of European Russia (50 guber-nias) the figure for 1896 was 1,617,000 dess. 
 under flax andfor 1897—1,669,000 dess. 
 ( Vestnik Finansov , ibid. 
, and 1898, No. 
 7), as against 1,399,000 dess. 
 at the beginning of the1890s ( Productive Forces , I, 36). 
 Similarly, general opinions expressed in publications also testify to the growth of commercial flax growing. 
 Thus, regarding the first twodecades after the Reform, the Historico-Statistical Survey states that “the region of flax cultivation for indus-trial purposes has been enlarged by several gubernias”(loc. 
 cit. 
, 71), which is due particularly to the extension of the railways. 
 Concerning the Yuryev Uyezd, Vladimir Gubernia, Mr. 
 V. 
 Prugavin wrote at the beginning of theeighties: “The cultivation of flax . 
 . 
 . 
 has become very wide-spread here during the past 10 to 15 years. 
” “Some large-family households sell flax to the extent of 300 to 500 rublesand more per annum. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 They buy” (flax seed) “in Rostov. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 The peasants in these parts are very careful in selecting seed” (The Village Community, Handicraft Industries and Agri-culture of Yuryev Uyezd , Vladimir Gubernia , Moscow, 1884, pp. 
 86-89). 
 The Zemstvo Statistical Returns for Tver Gubernia (Vol. 
 XIII, Pt. 
 2) notes that “the most impor-tant spring grain crops, barley and oats, are yielding place to potatoes and flax” (p. 
 151); in some uyezds flax occupies from 3 to w of the area under spring crops, for example, in Zubtsov, Kashin and other uyezds, “in which flax growing tion were very inexact; that is why we have preferred to take approximate estimates based on comparisons of the most varied sourcesmade by experts. 
 The amount of flax produced fluctuates consider-ably year by year. 
 For that reason Mr. 
 N. 
 —on, for example, who set out to draw the boldest conclusions about the “diminution” of flaxproduction and “the reduction of the area under flax” ( Sketches , p. 
 236 and foll. 
) from figures for some six years, slipped into the most curious errors (see P. 
 B. 
 Struve’s examination of them in Critical Remarks , p. 
 233 and foll. 
). 
 Let us add to what has been said in the text that according to the data cited by Mr. 
 N. 
 —on, the maximum area under flax in the 1880s was 1,372,000 dess. 
 and the weight of gatheredfibre 19,245,000 poods, whereas in 1896-1897 the area was 1,617,000-1,669,000 dess. 
, and the weight of gathered fibre 31,713,000-30,139,000 poods. 
 has assumed the clearly expressed speculative character of an industry” (p. 
 145), developing particularly on rented virgin and disused land. 
 Moreover, it is noted that in some gubernias, where free land is still available (virgin soil,wasteland, forest-cleared tracts), flax growing is particularlyexpanding, but in some of the old established flax-growinggubernias “the cultivation of flax is either on the old scaleor is even yielding place, for example, to the newly-intro-duced cultivation of root-crops, vegetables, etc. 
” ( Vestnik Finansov , 1898, No. 
 6, p. 
 376, and 1897, No. 
 29), i. 
e. 
, to other types of commercial farming. 
 As for flax exports, during the first two decades after the Reform they increased with remarkable rapidity: from anaverage of 4. 
6 million poods in the years 1857-1861 to 8. 
5 million poods in the years 1867-1871 and to 12. 
4 million poods in the years 1877-1881; but then exports seemedto become stationary, amounting in the years 1894-1897 toan average of 13. 
3 million poods. 
 * The development of com-mercial flax growing led, naturally, to exchange not onlybetween agriculture and industry (sale of flax and purchase of manufactured goods), but between different types of commercial agriculture (sale of flax and purchase of grain). 
 The following data concerning this interesting phenomenonclearly demonstrate that a home market for capitalismis created not only by the diversion of population fromagriculture to industry, but also by the specialisation of commercial farming.

 **See N. 
 Strokin, Flax Growing in Pskov Gubernia , St. 
 Peters-burg, 1882. 
 The author borrowed these data from the Proceedings of the Commission on Taxation. 
 How does this growth of commercial flax growing affect the peasantry, who, as we know, are the principal flax producer? * “Travelling through Pskov Gubernia and observ-ing its economic life, one cannot help noticing that side byside with occasional large and rich units, hamlets and vil-lages, there are extremely poor units; these extremes are a characteristic feature of the economic life of the flax area . 
” “Flax growing has taken a speculative turn,” and “the greater part” of the income from flax “is pocketed by buyers-up and by those who lease out land for flax growing” (Strokin,22-23). 
 The ruinous rents constitute real “money rent”(see above), and the mass of the peasants are in a state of“complete and hopeless dependence” (Strokin, ibid. 
) upon thebuyers-up. 
 The sway of merchant’s capital was established in this locality long ago, ** and what distinguishes the post-Reform period is the enormous concentration of this capi-tal, the undermining of the monopoly of the former smallbuyers-up and the formation of “flax agencies” which havecaptured the whole flax trade. 
 The significance of flax grow-ing, says Mr. 
 Strokin about Pskov Gubernia, “is expressed . 
 . 
 . 
 in the concentration of capital in a few hands” (p. 
 31). 
 Turning flax growing into a gamble, capital ruined vastnumbers of small agriculturists, who worsened the qualityof the flax, exhausted the land, were reduced to leasing outtheir allotments and finally swelled the ranks of “migratory”workers. 
 On the other hand, a slight minority of well-to-do peasants and traders were able—and competition made it necessary—to introduce technical improvements. 
 Coutéscutchers, both hand-worked (costing up to 25 rubles) andhorse-operated (three times dearer), were introduced. 
 In1869 there were only 557 such machines in Pskov Gubernia,in 1881 there were 5,710 (4,521 hand-worked and 1,189 horse-*Of 1,399,000 dess.

 In the black-earth belt, of 609,600 dess.

4% belongs to pri-vate owners ( Productive Forces , 1, 36). 
 **The Military Statistical Abstract in its day pointed to the fact that the “flax sown by the peasants very often really belongs tothe bulinyas ” (local name for small buyers-up), “while the peasant is merely a labourer on his field” (595). 
 Cf. 
 Historico-Statistical Survey , p. 
 88. 
 operated). 
 * “Today,” we read in the Historico-Statistical Survey , “every sound peasant family engaged in flax growing has a Couté hand-machine, which has actually come to becalled the ‘Pskov scutcher’” (loc. 
 cit. 
, 82-83). 
 What pro-portion this minority of “sound” householders who acquiremachines is to the rest of the peasantry, we have already seen in Chapter II. 
 Instead of the primitive contrivances which cleaned the seeds very badly, the Pskov Zemstvobegan to introduce improved seed-cleaners (trieurs), and“the more prosperous peasant industrialists” now find itprofitable to buy these machines themselves and to hirethem out to flax growers ( Vestnik Finansov , 1897, No. 
 29, p. 
 85). 
 The bigger buyers-up of flax establish drying rooms and presses and hire workers to sort and scutch the flax(see example given by Mr. 
 V. 
 Prugavin, loc. 
 cit. 
, 115). 
Lastly, it should be added that the processing of flax-fibrerequires quite a large number of workers: it is estimatedthat the cultivation of one dessiatine of flax requires 26 working days of agricultural work proper, and 77 days to extract the fibre from stalks ( Historico-Statistical Survey , 72). 
 Thus, the development of flax growing leads, on theone hand, to the farmer being more fully occupied duringthe winter and, on the other, to the creation of a demand forwage-labour on the part of those landlords and well-to-do peasants who engage in flax growing (see the example in Chapter III, §VI). 
 Thus, in the flax-growing area, too, the growth of commer-cial farming leads to the domination of capital and to thedifferentiation of the peasantry. 
 A tremendous obstacle tothe latter process is undoubtedly the ruinously high rent-ing prices of land, ** the pressure of merchant’s capital, the tying of the peasant to his allotment and the high paymentsfor the allotted land. 
 Hence, the wider the development *Strokin, 12. 
 **At the present time renting prices of flax land are falling due to the drop in the price of flax, but the area of land under flax, in the Pskov flax area in 1896, for example, has not diminished ( Vestnik Finansov , 1897, No. 
 29). 
 of land purchase by the peasants, * and of migration in search of employment, ** and the more widespread the use of improved implements and methods of cultivation, themore rapidly will merchant’s capital be supplanted by indus-trial capital, and the more rapidly will a rural bourgeoisiebe formed from among the peasantry, and the system of labour-service for the landlord replaced by the capitalist system. 
 VII. 
 THE TECHNICAL PROCESSING OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCE Above we have already had occasion to note (Chapter I, §I) that writers on agriculture, in classifying systems offarming according to the principal market product, assignthe industrial or technical system of farming to a specialcategory. 
 The essence of this system is that the agriculturalproduct, before going into consumption (personal or produc-tive), undergoes technical processing. 
 The establishmentswhich effect this processing either constitute part of the veryfarms on which the raw material is produced or belong tospecial industrialists who buy up the raw material fromthe peasant farmers. 
 From the standpoint of political econ-omy the difference between these two types is unimportant. 
The growth of agricultural technical trades is extremelyimportant as regards the development of capitalism. 
 Firstly,this growth represents one of the forms of the developmentof commercial farming, and is, moreover, the form that showsmost vividly the conversion of agriculture into a branch of *Pskov Gubernia is one of the foremost in Russia in the devel-opment of the purchase of land by peasants. 
 According to theCombined Statistical Material on the Economic Position of the Rural Population (published by Chancellery of the Committee of Minis-ters), the lands purchased by peasants amount here to 23% of the total allotment arable, this is the maximum for all the 50 gubernias. 
 It works out at an average of 0. 
7 dess. 
 of purchased land per head ofthe male peasant population as of January 1, 1892. 
 In this respectonly Novgorod and Taurida gubernias exceed Pskov Gubernia. 
 **The number of males leaving Pskov Gubernia in search of employment increased, statistics show from 1865-1875 to 1896 nearly fourfold (Industries of the Peasant Population of Pskov Gubernia , Pskov, 1898, p. 
 3). 
 industry of capitalist society. 
 Secondly, the development of the technical processing of agricultural produce is usually connected intimately with technical progress in agriculture: on the one hand, the very production of the raw materialfor processing often necessitates agricultural improvement(the planting of root-crops, for example); on the other hand,the waste products of the processing are frequently utilisedin agriculture, thus increasing its effectiveness and restor-ing, at least in some measure, the equilibrium, the inter-dependence, between agriculture and industry, thedisturbance of which constitutes one of the most profoundcontradictions of capitalism. 
 We must accordingly now describe the development of technical agricultural trades in post-Reform Russia. 
 1) D i s t i l l i n g Here we regard distilling only from the point of view of agriculture. 
 Accordingly, there is no need for us to dwellon the rapid concentration of distilling in large plants (partly due to excise requirements), on the rapid progress of factory technique, with the consequent cheapening ofproduction, and the increase in excise duties which hasoutstripped this cheapening of production and because ofits excessive amount has retarded the growth of consump-tion and production. 
 Here are data for “agricultural” distilling in the whole of the Russian Empire *: Distilleries in 1896-97No.

 159 5,457 Total ...... 2,037 29,788 *The law of June 4, 1890, laid down the following criteria of agricultural distilling: 1) distilling season, from September 1 to June 1, when no field-work is done; 2) proportion between the quantity ofspirits distilled and the number of dessiatines of arable land on theestate. 
 Plants carrying on partly agricultural and partly industrial{{ Thus, over /FL0134 of the distilleries (accounting for over t of the total output) are directly connected with agriculture. 
 Being large capitalist enterprises, these establishments lend the same character to all the landlord farms on which theyare set up (the distilleries belong almost without exceptionto landlords, mainly to members of the nobility). 
 Thetype of commercial farming under review is particularlydeveloped in the central black-earth gubernias, in which are concentrated over 0 of the total number of distilleries in the Russian Empire (239 in 1896-97, of which 225 wereagricultural and mixed), producing over a quarter of thetotal output of spirits (7,785,000 vedros in 1896-97, of which6,828,000 at agricultural and at mixed distilleries). 
 Thus inthe area where labour-service predominates, the commercial character of agriculture most frequently (as compared with other areas) manifests itself in the distilling of vodka fromgrain and potatoes. 
 Distilling from potatoes has undergonea particularly rapid development since the Reform, as maybe seen from the following data relating to the whole of theRussian Empire *: Materials used for distilling (thousand poods) All cropsPotatoes % Potatoes In 1867 .

8 Thus, with a general twofold increase in the quantity of crops distilled, the quantity of potatoes used increased about15-fold. 
 This fact strikingly corroborates the propositionestablished above (§I in this chapter) that the enormousincrease in the potato area and crop signifies the growthof precisely commercial and capitalist farming, along with improvement of agricultural technique, with the replace-ment of the three-field system by multi-field crop rotation, distilling are called mixed distilleries (cf. 
 Vestnik Finansov , 1896, No. 
 25, and 1898, No. 
 10). 
 *Sources: Military Statistical Abstract , 427; Productive Forces , IX, 49, and Vestnik Finansov , 1898, No. 
 14. 
{ etc. 
* The area of the biggest development of distilling is also distinguished for the biggest (in the Russian gubernias, i. 
e. 
, not counting the Baltic and the western gubernias) net per-capita harvest of potatoes. 
 Thus in the northernblack-earth gubernias the figures for 1864-1866, 1870-1879 and 1883-1887 were 0. 
44, 0. 
62 and 0. 
60 chet-verts respectively, whereas for the whole of EuropeanRussia (50 gubernias) the corresponding figures were 0. 
27, 0. 
43 and 0. 
44 chetverts. 
 As far back as the beginning of the 80s the Historico-Statistical Survey noted that “the region marked by the greatest expansion of potato cultiva-tion covers all the gubernias of the central and northernparts of the black-earth belt, the Volga and Transvolgagubernias and the central non-black-earth gubernias” (loc. 
 cit. 
, p. 
 44). 
 ** The expansion of potato cultivation by landlords and well-to-do peasants means an increase in the demand forhired labour; the cultivation of a dessiatine of potatoesabsorbs much more labour *** than the cultivation of a dessia-tine of cereals and the use of machinery in, for example, *Cf.

 The by-products of distilling (wash) are often used (evenby commercial and not only agricultural establishments) in commer-cial beef-cattle raising. 
—Cf. 
 Agricultural Statistical Information , Vol. 
 VII, p. 
 122 and passim. 
 **The great rapidity with which the use of potatoes for distilling has increased in the central agricultural gubernias can be seen fromthe following data. 
 In six gubernias: Kursk, Orel, Tula, Ryazan,Tambov and Voronezh, during the period 1864-65 to 1873-74 anaverage of 407,000 poods of potatoes was distilled per annum; during1874-75 to 1883-84—7,482,000 poods; during 1884-85 to 1893-94, 20,077,000 poods. 
 For the whole of European Russia the corresponding figures are: 10,633,000 poods, 30,599,000 poods and 69,620,000 poods. 
The number of distilleries using potatoes in the above guberniasaveraged 29 per annum in the period 1867-68 to 1875-76; in the period1876-77 to 1884-85, 130; and in the period 1885-86 to 1893-94, 163. 
For the whole of European Russia the corresponding figures are: 739, 979, 1,195 (see Agricultural Statistical Information , Vol. 
 VII). 
 *** For example, according to the Zemstvo statistical returns for Balakhna Uyezd, Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia, the cultivationof one dess. 
 of potatoes requires 77. 
2 working days, including 59. 
2working days of a woman occupied in planting, hoeing, weeding anddigging. 
 The greatest increase, therefore, is in the demand for the day labour of local peasant women. 
 the central black-earth area is still very slight. 
 Thus, while the number of workers engaged in the distilling industry proper has decreased, * the elimination of labour-service by the capitalist system of farming, with the cultivation ofroot-crops, has increased the demand for rural day labourers. 
 2) B e e t -S u g a r P r o d u c t i o n The processing of sugar-beet is even more highly concen-trated in big capitalist enterprises than distilling is, and islikewise an adjunct of the landlords’ (mainly noblemen’s)estates. 
 The principal area of this industry is the south-west-ern gubernias, and then the southern black-earth and cen-tral black-earth gubernias. 
 The area under sugar-beet amounted in the 60s to about 100,000 dess. 
, ** in the 70s to about 160,000 dess. 
 ***; in 1886-1895 to 239,000 dess. 
, **** in 1896-1898 to 369,000 dess. 
,( *) in 1900 to 478,778 dess. 
, in 1901 to 528,076 dess. 
 ( Torgovo-Promyshlennaya Gazeta , 1901, No. 
 123), in 1905-06 to 483,272 dess. 
 ( Vestnik Finan-sov, 1906, No. 
 12). 
 Hence, in the period following the Reform the area cultivated has increased more than 5-fold. 
 Incomparably more rapid has been the growth of the amountof sugar-beet harvested and processed: on an average theweight of sugar-beet processed in the Empire in the years *In 1867 the number of workers in European Russia employed in distilleries was estimated at 52,660 ( Military Statistical Abstract . 
 In Chapter VII we shall show that this source tremendously overstatesthe number of factory workers), and in 1890 at 26,102 (according toOrlov’s Directory ). 
 The workers engaged in distilling proper are few in number and, moreover, differ but little from rural workers. 
 “All the workers employed in the village distilleries,” says Dr. 
 Zhbankov, for example, “which, moreover, do not operate regularly, since theworkers leave for field-work in the summer, differ very distinctlyfrom regular factory workers they wear peasant clothes, retain theirrural habits, and do not acquire the particular polish characteristicof factory workers” (loc. 
 cit. 
, II, 121).

 In European Russia, without the Kingdom of Poland, there was in 1896-1898 an area of 327,000 dess, under sugar-beet. 
 1860-1864 was 4. 
1 million berkovets *; in 1870-1874— 9. 
3 million; in 1875-1879—12. 
8 million; in 1890-1894— 29. 
3 million; and in 1895-96 and 1897-98—35 million. 
 ** The amount of processed sugar-beet has grown since the 60s more than 8-fold. 
 Hence, there has been an enor-mous increase in the beet yield, i. 
e. 
, in labour produc-tivity, on the big estates organised on capitalist lines. 
 *** The introduction of a root-plant like beet into the rotation is indissolubly linked with the transition to a more advanced system of cultivation, with improved tillage and cattlefeed, etc. 
 “The tillage of the soil for beetroot,” we read inthe Historico-Statistical Survey (Vol. 
 I), “which, generally speaking, is rather complicated and difficult, has been broughtto a high degree of perfection on many beet farms, espe-cially in the south-western and Vistula gubernias. 
 In different localities, various more or less improved implementsand ploughs are used for tilling; in some cases even steamploughing has been introduced ” (p. 
 109). 
 This progress of large-scale capitalist farming gives rise to quite a considerable increase in the demand for agricul-tural wage-workers—regular and particularly day labour-ers—the employment of female and child labour beingparticularly extensive (cf. 
 Historico-Statistical Survey , II, 32). 
 Among the peasants of the neighbouring gubernias aspecial type of migration has arisen, known as migration“to sugar” (ibid. 
, 42). 
 It is estimated that the complete culti-vation of a morg ( =q dess. 
) **** of beet land requires 40 working days ( Hired Labour , 72). 
 The Combined Material on the Position of the Rural Population (published by Com-mittee of Ministers) estimates that the cultivation of onedessiatine of beet land, when done by machine, requires 12,and when by hand 25, working days of males, not counting women and juveniles (pp. 
 X-XI). 
 Thus, the cultivation of the total beet area in Russia probably engages not lessthan 300,000 agricultural day labourers, men and women.

— Ed. 
 But the increase in the number of dessiatines under beet is not enough to give a complete idea of the demand for hired labour, since some jobs are paid for at so much per berkovets. 
 Here, for example, is what we read in Reports and Investi-gations of Handicraft Industry in Russia (published by Minis-try of State Properties, Vol. 
 II, St. 
 Petersburg, 1894, p. 
 82). 
 “The female population both of the town, and of the uyezd” (the town of Krolevets, Chernigov Gubernia, is referred to) “think highly of work on the beet fields; in the autumn the cleaning of beets is paid at 10 kopeks per berkovets, and twowomen clean from six to ten berkovets a day, but some con-tract to work during the growing season as well, weedingand hoeing; in that case, for the full job, including diggingand cleaning, they get 25 kopeks per berkovets of cleaned beets. 
” The conditions of the workers on the beet plantations are extremely bad. 
 For instance, the Vrachebnaya Khronika Kharkovskoi Gubernii * (September 1899, quoted in Russkiye Vedomosti , 1899, No. 
 254) cites “a number of exceedingly deplorable facts about the conditions of those working on the red-beet plantations . 
 Thus, the Zemstvo physician, Dr. 
 Podolsky, of the village of Kotelva, Akhtyrka Uyezd, writes: ‘In the autumn typhus usually breaks out among young people employed on the red-beet plantations of thewell-to-do peasants . 
 The sheds assigned for the workers’ leisure and sleeping quarters are kept by such planters ina very filthy condition; by the time the job ends the straw used for sleeping is literally converted into dung, for it is never changed: this becomes a breeding ground of infection. 
Typhus has had to be diagnosed immediately in the case offour or five patients brought in from one and the sameplantation. 
’ In the opinion of this doctor, ‘most of thesyphilis cases come from the red-beet plantations. 
’ Mr. 
 Feinberg rightly asserts that ‘work on the plantations, which is no less injurious to the workers themselves and tothe surrounding population than work in the factories, has particularly disastrous consequences, because large numbersof women and juveniles are engaged in it, and because theworkers here are without the most elementary protection from society and the State’; in view of this, the author wholly *Medical Chronicle of Kharkov Gubernia . 
—Ed. 
 supports the opinion expressed by Dr. 
 Romanenko at the Seventh Congress of Doctors of Kharkov Gubernia that ‘in issuing compulsory regulations, consideration must also be given to the conditions of the workers on the beet plantations . 
 These workers lack the most essential things; they live formonths under the open sky and eat from a common bowl. 
’” Thus, the growth of beet cultivation has enormously increased the demand for rural workers, converting the neigh-bouring peasantry into a rural proletariat. 
 The increase in the number of rural workers has been but slightly checkedby the inconsiderable drop in the number of workers engagedin the beet-sugar industry proper. 
 * 3) P o t a t o -S t a r c h P r o d u c t i o n From branches of technical production conducted exclu-sively on landlord farms let us pass to such as are more orless within the reach of the peasantry. 
 These include, pri-marily, the processing of potatoes (partly also wheat and other cereals) into starch and treacle. 
 Starch production has developed with particular rapidity in the post-Reformperiod owing to the enormous growth of the textile indus-try, which raises a demand for starch. 
 The area covered bythis branch of production is mainly the non-black-earth,the industrial, and, partly, the northern black-earth guber-nias. 
 The Historico-Statistical Survey (Vol. 
 II) estimates that in the middle of the 60s, there were about 60 establish-ments with an output valued at about 270,000 rubles,while in 1880 there were 224 establishments with an outputvalued at 1,317,000 rubles. 
 In 1890, according to the Direc-tory of Factories and Works there were 192 establishments employing 3,418 workers, with an output valued at1,760,000 rubles. 
 ** “In the past 25 years,” we read in the *In European Russia 80,919 workers were employed in 1867 at beet-sugar factories and refineries ( The Ministry of Finance Year-book , I. 
 The Military Statistical Abstract overstated the figure here too, giving it as 92,000, evidently counting the same workers twice). 
 The figure for 1890 is 77,875 workers (Orlov’s Directory ). 
 **We take the data given in the Historico-Statistical Survey as being the most uniform and comparable. 
 The Returns and Historico-Statistical Survey , “the number of establishments engaged in starch production has increased 4 2 times and the total output 10 w times; nevertheless, this productivity is far from covering the demand for starch” (p. 
 116), asevidenced by the increased starch imports from abroad. 
 Ana-lysing the data for each gubernia, the Historico-Statistical Survey reaches the conclusion that our production of potato-starch (unlike that of wheat-starch) is of an agricultural character, being concentrated in the hands of peasants and landlords. 
 “Showing promise of extensive development”in the future, “it is even now furnishing our rural popu-lation with considerable advantages” (126). 
 We shall see in a moment who enjoys these advantages. 
 But first let us note that two processes must be distinguished in the development of starch production: on the one hand, the appearance of new small factories and the growth ofpeasant production, and on the other, the concentration ofproduction in large steam-powered factories. 
 For instance,in 1890 there were 77 steam-powered factories, with 52%of the total number of workers and 60% of the total output concentrated in them. 
 Of these works only 11 were estab-lished before 1870, 17 in the 70s, 45 in the 80s, and 2 in 1890(Mr. 
 Orlov’s Directory ). 
 To acquaint ourselves with the economy of peasant starch production, let us turn to local investigations. 
 In MoscowGubernia, in 1880-81, 43 villages in 4 uyezds engaged in starch making. 
 * The number of establishments was official data of the Department of Commerce and Manufacture, estimated that in 1864 there were in Russia 55 starch-making estab-lishments whose output was valued at 231,000 rubles. 
 The Military Statistical Abstract estimates that in 1866 there were 198 establish-ments with an output valued at 563,000 rubles, but this undoubtedlyincluded small establishments, not now reckoned as factories. 
 Generallyspeaking, the statistics of this trade are very unsatisfactory: smallfactories are some times counted, and at others (much more often)are not. 
 Thus, Orlov’s Directory gives the number of establishments in Yaroslavl Gubernia in 1890 as 25 (the List for 1894-95 gives 20), while according to the Survey of Yaroslavl Gubernia (Vol. 
 II, 1896), in Rostov Uyezd alone there were 810 starch and treacle establish-ments. 
 Hence, the figures given in the text can indicate only thedynamics of the phenomenon, but not the actual development of theindustry. 
 *Statistical Returns for Moscow Gubernia , Vol. 
 VII, Pt. 
 1, estimated at 130, employing 780 workers and having an output valued at not less than 137,000 rubles. 
 The industry spread mainly after the Reform; its technique gradually improved and larger establishments were formed requiringmore fixed capital and showing a higher productivity oflabour. 
 Hand graters were replaced by improved ones, thenhorse power appeared, and finally the drum was introduced, considerably improving and cheapening production. 
 Here are data we have compiled from a house-to-house census of “handicraftsmen,” according to size of establishment: Workers No.

 Theseestablishments bring the peasant bourgeoisie considerableprofit, and also improve agricultural technique. 
 But thesituation of the workers in these workshops is very unsat-isfactory, owing to the extremely insanitary working condi-tions and the long working day.

 To enlarge their business the workshop owners rent a considerable amount of allotment land from the poor peasants. 
 Forexample, in the village of Tsybino (Bronnitsy Uyezd), 18owners of starch workshops (out of 105 peasant families inthe village) rent allotments from peasants who have leftin search of employment, and also from horseless peasants, thus adding to their own 61 allotments 133 more, which they have rented; concentrated in their hands are a total of194 allotments, i. 
e. 
, 44. 
5% of the total number of allot-ments in the village. 
 “Exactly similar things,” we read inthe Returns , “are met with in other villages where the starch industry is more or less developed” (loc. 
 cit. 
, 42). 
 * The owners of the starch workshops have twice as much live-stock as the other peasants: they average 3. 
5 horses and3. 
4 cows per household, as against 1. 
5 horses and 1. 
7 cowsamong the local peasants in general. 
 Of the 68 workshopowners (covered by the house-to-house census) 10 ownpurchased land, 22 rent non-allotment land and 23 rent allotment land. 
 In short, these are typical representatives of the peasant bourgeoisie. 
 Exactly analogous relations are to be found in the starch-making industry in the Yuryev Uyezd, Vladimir Gubernia(V. 
 Prugavin, loc. 
 cit. 
, p. 
 104 and foll. 
). 
 Here, too, the work-shop owners carry on production mainly with the aid of wage-labour (out of 128 workers in 30 workshops, 86 are hired); and here, too, the workshop owners are far abovethe mass of the peasantry as far as stock-breeding and agri-culture are concerned; they use potato pulp as feed for theircattle. 
 Even real capitalist farmers emerge from amongthe peasants. 
 Mr. 
 Prugavin describes the farm of a peas-ant who owns a starch works (valued at about 1,500 rubles) employing 12 wage-workers. 
 This peasant grows potatoes onhis own farm, which he has enlarged by renting land. 
 Thecrop rotation is seven-field and includes clover. 
 For the farmwork he employs from 7 to 8 workers, hired from spring to *Compare with this statement the general view of V.

 autumn (“from end to end”). 
 The pulp is used as cattle feed, and the owner intends to use the waste water for his fields. 
 Mr. 
 Y. 
 Prugavin assures us that this works enjoys “quite exceptional conditions. 
” Of course, in any capitalist societythe rural bourgeoisie will always constitute a very smallminority of the rural population, and in this sense will,if you like, be an “exception. 
” But this term will not elimi-nate the fact that in the starch-making area, as in all the other commercial farming areas in Russia, a class of rural entrepreneurs is being formed, who are organising capital-ist agriculture. 
 * 4) V e g e t a b l e -O i l P r o d u c t i o n The extraction of oil from linseed, hemp, sunflower and other seeds is also frequently an agricultural industry. 
 One can gauge the development of vegetable-oil productionin the post-Reform period from the fact that in 1864 thevegetable-oil output had an estimated value of 1,619,000rubles, in 1879 of 6,486,000 rubles, and in 1890 of 12,232,000rubles. 
 ** In this branch of production, too, a double process of development is to be observed: on the one hand, small peasant (and sometimes also landlord) oil presses produc-ing oil for sale are established in the villages. 
 On theother hand, large steam-driven works develop, which concen-trate production and oust the small establishments. 
 *** Here *As a matter of interest, let us mention that both Mr. 
 Pru-gavin (loc. 
 cit. 
, 107), the author of the description of the Moscowindustry (loc. 
 cit. 
, 45), and Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
 ( Essays on Handicraft Industry , 127), have discerned the “artel principle” in the fact that some gratingestablishments belong to several owners. 
 Our sharp-eyed Narodniks have contrived to observe a special “principle” in the association of rural entrepreneurs, and have failed to see any new social-economic“principles” in the very existence and development of a class of ruralentrepreneurs. 
 **Returns and Material of the Ministry of Finance , 1866 , no. 
 4, Orlov’s Directory , 1st and 3rd editions. 
 We do not give figures for the number of establishments because our factory statistics confuse small agricultural oil-pressing establishments with big industrial ones, attimes including the former, and at others not including them fordifferent gubernias at different times. 
 In the 1860s, for example, ahost of small oil presses were included in the category of “works. 
” *** For example, in 1890, 11 works out of 383 had an output valued at 7,170,000 rubles out of 12,232,000 rubles. 
 This victory of the industrial over the rural entrepreneurs is causing profound we are interested solely in the agricultural processing of oil-bearing plants. 
 “The owners of the hempseed oil presses,” we read in the Historico-Statistical Survey (Vol. 
 II), “belong to the well-to-do members of the peasantry”; they attachparticular value to vegetable-oil production because itenables them to obtain excellent feed for their cattle (oil-cake). 
 Mr. 
 Prugavin (loc. 
 cit. 
), noting the “extensive develop-ment of the production of linseed oil” in the Yuryev Uyezd, Vladimir Gubernia, states that the peasants derive “no little advantage” from it (pp. 
 65-66), that crop and stockraising is conducted on a far higher level by peasants whoown oil presses than by the bulk of the peasantry and thatsome of the oil millers also resort to the hire of ruralworkers (loc. 
 cit. 
, tables, pp. 
 26-27 and 146-147). 
 The Perm handicraft census for 1894-95 also showed that crop raising is conducted on a much higher level by handicraftoil millers than by the bulk of the peasants (larger areasunder crops, far more animals, better harvests, etc. 
), andthat this improvement in cultivation is accompanied bythe hiring of rural workers. 
 * In the post-Reform period in Voronezh Gubernia, there has been a particular develop-ment of the commercial cultivation of sunflower seed, which is crushed for oil in local presses. 
 The area under sunflowersin Russia in the 70s was estimated at about 80,000 dess. 
(Historico-Statistical Survey , I), and in the 80s at about 136,000 dess. 
, of which q belonged to peasants. 
 “Since then, however, judging by certain data, the area under this plant has considerably increased, in some places by100 per cent and even more” ( Productive Forces , I, 37). 
 “In the village of Alexeyevka alone” (Biryuch Uyezd, Voronezh Gubernia), we read in the Historico-Statistical dissatisfaction among our agrarians (e. 
g. 
, Mr. 
 S. 
 Korolenko, loc. 
 cit. 
) and our Narodniks (e. 
g. 
, Mr. 
 N. 
 —on’s Sketches , pp. 
 241-242). 
 We do not share their views. 
 The big works will raise the productivity of labour and socialise production. 
 That is one point. 
 Another is thatthe workers conditions in the big works will probably be better, andnot only from the material angle, than at the small agricultural oilpresses.

 II, “there are more than 40 oil presses, and Alexeyevka itself, solely owing to sunflowers, has prospered and grown from a wretched little hamlet into a rich town-ship, with houses and shops roofed with sheet iron” (p. 
 41). 
How this wealth of the peasant bourgeoisie was reflected inthe condition of the mass of the peasantry may be seen fromthe fact that in 1890, in the village of Alexeyevka, out of2,273 families registered (13,386 persons of both sexes), 1,761 had no draught animals, 1,699 had no implements, 1,480 cultivated no land, and only 33 families did notengage in industries. 
 * In general, it should be stated that peasant oil presses usually figure, in Zemstvo house-to-house censuses, among the“commercial and industrial establishments,” of whose dis-tribution and role we have already spoken in Chapter II. 
 5) T o b a c c o G r o w i n g In conclusion, let us make some brief observations on the development of tobacco growing. 
 The average crop in Russia for the years 1863-1867 was 1,923,000 poods from 32,161 dess. 
; for 1872-1878 it was 2,783,000 poods from 46,425 dess. 
; for the 80s, it was 4 million poods from 50,000 dess. 
 ** The number of plantations in the same periods was estimated at 75,000, 95,000 and 650,000 respectively, which evidently indicates a very considerable increase in the num-ber of small cultivators drawn into this type of commercial farming. 
 Tobacco growing requires a considerable number of workers. 
 Among the types of agricultural migration note is *Statistical Returns for Biryuch Uyezd , Voronezh Gubernia . 
— The number of industrial establishments counted in the village was153. 
 According to Mr. 
 Orlov’s Directory for 1890 there were in this village 6 oil presses employing 34 workers, with output valued at17,000 rubles, and according to the List of Factories and Works for 1894-95 there were 8 oil presses employing 60 workers, with an output valued at 151,000 rubles. 
 **The Ministry of Finance Yearbook , I. 
— Historico-Statistical Survey , Vol. 
 I. 
— Productive Forces , IX, 62. 
 The area under tobacco fluctuates considerably from year to year: for example, the averagefor 1889-1894 was 47,813 dess. 
 (crop—4,180,000 poods), and for 1892-1894 was 52,516 dess. 
 with a crop of 4,878,000 poods. 
 See Returns for Russia , 1896, pp. 
 208-209. 
 therefore made of migration to tobacco plantations (partic-ularly to the outer gubernias in the South, where the culti-vation of tobacco has recently expanded with exceptional rapidity). 
 Reference has already been made in publicationsto the fact that the workers on the tobacco plantations leada very hard life. 
 * In the Survey of Tobacco Growing in Russia (Parts II and III, St. 
 Petersburg, 1894, published by order of the Department of Agriculture), there are very detailed and interesting data on tobacco growing as a branch of commer-cial farming. 
 Mr. 
 V. 
 S. 
 Shcherbachov, describing tobaccogrowing in Malorossia, gives wonderfully precise informa-tion on three uyezds of Poltava Gubernia (Priluki, Lokhvi-tsa and Romny). 
 This information, gathered by the author and arranged by the Bureau of Statistics, Poltava Gubernia Zemstvo Board, covers 25,089 peasant farms in the threeuyezds that grow tobacco; they have 6,844 dessiatinesunder tobacco and 146,774 dessiatines under cereals. 
 Thefarms are distributed as follows: Three uyezds of Poltava Gubernia (1888) Area in dessiatines Groups of farms according No.

. 
 25,089 6,844 146,774 We see an enormous concentration of both the tobacco and the cereal area in the hands of the capitalist farms. 
Less than one-eighth of the farms (3,000 out of 25,000)hold more than half the area under cereals (74,000 dess. 
out of 147,000), with an average of nearly 25 dess. 
 per farm. 
 *Beloborodov, above-mentioned article in Severny Vestnik , 1896, No. 
 2. 
 Russkiye Vedomosti , 1897, No. 
 127 (May 10) reported a trial in which 20 working women sued the owner of a tobacco plan-tation in the Crimea, and stated that “numerous facts were revealedin court, depicting the impossible hard life of the plantation workers. 
” Almost half the area under tobacco (3,200 dess. 
 out of 6,800) belongs to these farms, the average per farm being over 1 dessiatine, whereas for all the other groups the area under tobacco does not exceed one-to two-tenths of adessiatine per household.

 Shcherbachov, in addition, gives data showing the same farms grouped according to area under tobacco: No.

. 
 25,089 6,844 From this it can be seen that the concentration of the tobacco area is considerably greater than that of the cereal area. 
 The branch of specifically commercial agricul-ture in this locality is concentrated in the hands ofcapitalists to a greater extent than is agriculture in general. 
Out of 25,000 farms, 2,773 account for 4,145 dess. 
 undertobacco out of 6,844 dess. 
, or more than three-fifths. 
 Thebiggest tobacco planters, numbering 324 (a little over one-tenth of all the planters), have 2,360 dess. 
 under tobacco, or over one-third of the total area. 
 This averages over 7 dessiatines under tobacco per farm. 
 To judge of the sort of farm it must be, let us recall that tobacco cultivationrequires at least two workers for a period of 4 to 8 summer months, depending on the grade of tobacco. 
 The owner of 7 dessiatines under tobacco must there-fore have at least 14 workers; in other words, he mustundoubtedly base his farm on wage-labour. 
 Some grades oftobacco require not two but three seasonal workers per dessia-tine, and day labourers in addition. 
 In a word, we see quiteclearly that the greater the degree to which agriculture becomes commercial, the more highly developed is its capi-talist organisation. 
{{ The preponderance of small and tiny farms among the tobacco growers (11,997 farms out of 25,089 have up to one-tenth of a dessiatine planted) does not in the least refute the fact of the capitalist organisation of this branch ofcommercial agriculture; for this mass of tiny farms accountsfor an insignificant share of the output (11,997, i. 
e. 
, nearlyhalf the farms, have in all 522 dess. 
 out of 6,844, or lessthan one-tenth). 
 Nor do “average” figures, to which people so often confine themselves, provide a picture of the real situation (the average per farm is a little over 4 dessiatine under tobacco). 
 In some uyezds the development of capitalist agriculture and the concentration of production are still more marked. 
In the Lokhvitsa Uyezd, for example, 229 farms out of 5,957 each have 20 dessiatines and more under cereals. 
 Their owners have 22,799 dess. 
 under cereals out of a totalof 44,751, i. 
e. 
, more than half. 
 Each farmer has about100 dess. 
 under crops. 
 Of the land under tobacco they have1,126 dess. 
 out of 2,003 dess. 
 And if the farms are groupedaccording to area under tobacco, we have in this uyezd 132 farmers out of 5,957 with two and more dessiatines under tobacco. 
 These 132 farmers have 1,441 dess. 
 under tobacco outof 2,003, i. 
e. 
, 72% and more than ten dessiatines under tobacco per farm. 
 At the other extreme of the same LokhvitsaUyezd we have 4,360 farms (out of 5,957) having up to one-tenth of a dessiatine each under tobacco, and altogether 133 dessiatines out of 2,003, i. 
e. 
, 6%. 
 It goes without saying that the capitalist organisation of production is accompanied here by a very considerable development of merchant ’s capital and by all sorts of exploi-tation outside the sphere of production. 
 The small tobaccogrowers have no drying sheds, are unable to give their tobacco time to ferment and to sell it (in 3 to 6 weeks) as a finished product. 
 They sell the unfinished product at half the price to buyers-up, who very often plant tobacco them-selves on rented land. 
 The buyers-up “squeeze the smallplanters in every way” (p. 
 31 of cited publication). 
 Commer-cial agriculture is commercial capitalist production: this relation can be clearly traced (if only one is able to select the proper methods) in this branch of agricul-ture too. 
 VIII. 
 INDUSTRIAL VEGETABLE AND FRUIT GROWING; SUBURBAN FARMING With the fall of serfdom, “landlord fruit growing,” which had been developed on quite a considerable scale, “suddenlyand rapidly fell into decline almost all over Russia. 
” * The construction of railways changed the situation, giving a“tremendous impetus” to the development of new, commer-cial fruit growing, and brought about a “complete change for the better” in this branch of commercial agriculture. 
 ** O n the one hand, the influx of cheap fruit from the South under-mined the industry in the centres where it was formerly con-ducted ***; and on the other hand, industrial fruit growing developed, for example, in the Kovno, Vilna, Minsk, Grodno, Mogilev and Nizhni-Novgorod gubernias, along with the expansion of the fruit market. 
 **** Mr. 
 V. 
 Pashkevich points out that an investigation into the condition of fruit farmingin 1893-94 revealed a considerable development of it as anindustrial branch of agriculture in the previous ten years,an increase in the demand for gardeners, undergardeners, etc. 
( *) Statistics confirm such views: the amount of fruit carried by the Russian railways is increasing,( **) fruit imports, which increased in the first decade after the Reform,are declining. 
( ***) It stands to reason that commercial vegetable growing, which provides articles of consumption for incomparably larger masses of the population than fruit growing does, has developed still more rapidly and still more extensively. 
Industrial vegetable growing becomes widespread, firstly,near the towns( **** ); secondly, near factory and commercial *Historico-Statistical Survey , I, p.

 and industrial settlements * and also along the railways; and thirdly, in certain villages, scattered throughout Russia and famous for their vegetables. 
 ** It should be observed that there is a demand for this type of produce not only amongthe industrial, but also among the agricultural population:let us recall that the budgets of the Voronezh peasants showa per-capita expenditure on vegetables of 47 kopeks, morethan half of this expenditure being on purchased produce. 
 To acquaint ourselves with the social and economic rela-tions that arise in this type of commercial agriculture wemust turn to the data of local investigations in theparticularly developed vegetable-growing areas. 
 NearSt. 
 Petersburg, for example, frame and hot-house vegetablegrowing is widely developed, having been introduced by migratory vegetable growers from Rostov. 
 The number of frames owned by big growers runs into thousands, and bymedium growers, into hundreds. 
 “Some of the big vegetablegrowers supply tens of thousands of poods of pickled cabbageto the army. 
” *** According to Zemstvo statistics in Peters-burg Uyezd 474 households of the local population are engaged in vegetable growing (about 400 rubles income per household) and 230 in fruit growing. 
 Capitalist relations arevery extensively developed both in the form of merchant’scapital (the industry is “ruthlessly exploited by profiteers”)and in the form of hiring workers. 
 Among the immi-grant population, for example, there are 115 master vege-table growers (with an income of over 3,000 rubles each) and 711 worker vegetable growers (with an income of 116rubles each. 
) **** *See examples of settlements of this type in Chapters VI and VII.

 Actually there are far more vegetable growers than stated in the text, for most of them have been classed underprivate-landowner farming, whereas the data cited refer only topeasant farming. 
 The peasant vegetable growers near Moscow are the same sort of typical members of the rural bourgeoisie. 
 “According to an approximate estimate, over 4 million poods of vegeta-bles and greens reach Moscow’s markets every year. 
 Some ofthe villages do a big trade in pickled vegetables: NogatinoVolost sells nearly a million vedros of pickled cabbage tofactories and barracks, and even sends consignments toKronstadt. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 Commercial vegetable growing is widespread in all the Moscow uyezds, chiefly in the vicinity of towns and factories. 
” * “The cabbage is chopped by hired labourers who come from Volokolamsk Uyezd” ( Historico-Statistical Survey , I, p. 
 19). 
 Exactly similar relations exist in the well-known vegeta-ble-growing district in Rostov Uyezd, Yaroslavl Gubernia, embracing 55 vegetable-growing villages—Porechye, Ugo-dichi and others. 
 All the land, except pastures and meadows,has long been turned into vegetable fields. 
 The technicalprocessing of vegetables—preserving—is highly developed. 
 ** Together with the product of the land, the land itselfand labour-power are converted into commodities. 
 Despite the “village community,” the inequality of land tenure, for example, in the village of Porechye, is very great: in onecase a family of 4 has 7 “vegetable plots,” in another afamily of 3 has 17; this is explained by the fact that no peri-odical land redistribution takes place here; only privateredivisions take place, and the peasants “freely exchange” their “vegetable plots” or “patches” ( Survey of Yaroslavl Gubernia , 97-98). 
 *** “A large part of the field-work . 
 . 
 . 
 is done by male and female day labourers, many of whom come *Productive Forces , IV, 49 and foll. 
 It is interesting to note that different villages specialise in producing particular kinds ofvegetables.

 A comparison of the data given by Mr. 
 Stolpyansky(1885) and by the Directory (1890) shows a considerable increase in the factory production of canned goods in this area.

 Volgin’s “doubt” as to whether “the land occupied by vegetable plots is often redivided” (op.

, 172, footnote). 
 to Porechye in the summer season both from neighbouring villages and from neighbouring gubernias” (ibid. 
, 99). 
 It is estimated that in the whole of Yaroslavl Gubernia 10,322 persons (of whom 7,689 are from Rostov) engagedin “agriculture and vegetable growing” are migratory workers—i. 
e. 
, in the majority of cases are wage-workersin the given occupation. 
 * The above quoted data on the migration of rural workers to the metropolitan gubernias,101 Yaroslavl Gubernia, etc. 
, should be brought into connectionwith the development not only of dairy farming but alsoof commercial vegetable growing. 
 Vegetable growing also includes the hot-house cultiva-tion of vegetables, an industry that is rapidly developingamong the well-to-do peasants of Moscow and Tver guber-nias. 
 ** In the first-named gubernia the 1880-81 census showed 88 establishments with 3,011 frames; there were 213workers, of whom 47 (22. 
6%) were hired; the total output wasvalued at 54,400 rubles. 
 The average hot-house vegetablegrower had to put at least 300 rubles into the “business. 
”Of the 74 peasants for whom house-to-house returns are given, 41 possess purchased land, and as many rent land, there is an average of 2. 
2 horses per peasant. 
 It is clear from thisthat the hot-house vegetable industry is only within the reachof members of the peasant bourgeoisie. 
 *** In the south of Russia melon growing also comes within the type of commercial agriculture under review. 
 Here are some brief observations about its development in a district described in an interesting article in the Vestnik Finansov *Here, too, a characteristic specialisation of agriculture is to be observed: “It is noteworthy that in places where vegetable growing has become the special occupation of part of the peasant population, the others grow hardly any vegetables at all, but buy them at localmarkets and fairs” (S. 
 Korolenko, loc. 
 cit. 
, 285).

” This branch of production arose in the village of Bykovo (Tsarev Uyezd, Astrakhan Gubernia) at the end of the 60s and the beginning of the 70s. 
 The melons, which at first went only to the Volgaregion, were consigned, with the coming of the railways, tothe capital cities. 
 In the 80s the output “increased at leasttenfold” owing to the enormous profits (150 to 200 rublesper dess. 
) made by the initiators of the business. 
 Like true petty bourgeois, they did all they could to prevent the number of growers from increasing and were most careful in guardingfrom their neighbours the “secret” of this new and profitableoccupation. 
 Of course, all these heroic efforts of the “muzhikcultivator” * to stave off “fatal competition” ** were in vain, and the industry spread much wider—to Saratov Guber-nia and the Don region. 
 The drop in grain prices in the 90s gave a particularly strong impetus to production, compel-ling “local cultivators to seek a way out of their difficultiesin crop rotation systems. 
” *** The expansion of production considerably increased the demand for hired labour(melon growing requires a considerable amount of labour, so that the cultivation of one dessiatine costs from 30 to 50 rubles), and still more considerably increased the profits of theemployers and ground-rent. 
 Near “Log” Station (Gryazi-Tsaritsyn Railway), the area under water-melons in 1884was 20 dess. 
, in 1890 between 500 and 600 dess. 
, and in 1896between 1,400 and 1,500 dess. 
, while rent rose from 30 kopeks to between 1. 
50 and 2 rubles and to between 4 and 14 rubles per dess. 
 for the respective years. 
 The over-rapid expan-sion of melon planting led at last, in 1896, to overproduc-tion and a crisis, which finally confirmed the capitalistcharacter of this branch of commercial agriculture. 
 Melonprices fell to a point where they did not cover railway charges. 
 The melons were left ungathered in the fields. 
 After tast-ing tremendous profits the entrepreneurs now learned whatlosses were like. 
 But the most interesting thing is the meansthey have chosen for combating the crisis: the means chosen isto win new markets, to effect such a cheapening of produce *Mr. 
 N. 
 —on’s term for the Russian peasant. 
 **Mr. 
 V. 
 Prugavin’s term. 
 *** Better tilth is required to raise water-melons and this renders the soil more fertile when sown later to cereals. 
 and of railway tariffs as to transform it from an item of luxury into an item of consumption for the people (and at points of production, into cattle feed). 
 “Industrial melon growing,” the entrepreneurs assure us, “is on the road tofurther development; apart from high railway tariffs thereis no obstacle to its further growth. 
 On the contrary, theTsaritsyn-Tikhoretskaya Railway now under construc-tion . 
 . 
 . 
 opens a new and extensive area for industrial melon growing. 
” Whatever the further destiny of this “industry” may be, at any rate the history of the “melon crisis” isvery instructive, constituting a miniature picture, it is true,but a very vivid one, of the capitalist evolution of agri-culture. 
 We still have to say a few words about suburban farming . 
 The difference between it and the above-described types of commercial agriculture is that in their case the entire farmis adapted to some one chief market product. 
 In the case ofsuburban farming, however, the small cultivator trades inbits of everything: he trades in his house by letting it tosummer tenants and permanent lodgers, in his yard, in his horse and in all sorts of produce from his fields and farmyard: grain, cattle feed, milk, meat, vegetables, berries, fish,timber, etc. 
; he trades in his wife’s milk (baby-farmingnear the capitals), he makes money by rendering the mostdiverse (not always even mentionable) services to visitingtownsfolk, * etc. 
, etc. 
 ** The complete transformation by capitalism of the ancient type of patriarchal farmer, the complete subjugation of the latter to the “power of money”is expressed here so vividly that the suburban peasant isusually put in a separate category by the Narodnik whosays that he is “no longer a peasant. 
” But the differencebetween this type and all preceding types is only one of form. 
 The political and economic essence of the all-round transfor-*Cf. 
 Uspensky, A Village Diary . 
 **Let us refer, in illustration, to the above-quoted Material on peasant farming in Petersburg Uyezd. 
 The most varied typesof petty traffic have here assumed the form of “industries”; summer-letting, boarding, milk-selling, vegetable-selling, berry-selling, “horse employments,” baby-farming, crayfish-catching, fishing, etc.

 Borisov in Vol. 
 IX of Transactions of the Commis-sion of Inquiry into Handicraft Industry . 
 mation effected in the small cultivator by capitalism is every-where the same. 
 The more rapid the increase in the number of towns, the number of factory, commercial and industrial townships, and the number of railway stations, the moreextensive is the area of the transformation of our “village-community man” into this type of peasant. 
 We should notforget what was said in his day by Adam Smith—thatimproved communications tend to convert every village into a suburb. 
 * Remote areas cut off from the outside world, already an exception, are with every passing day increas-ingly becoming as rare as antiquities, and the cultivator isturning with ever-growing rapidity into an industrialistsubjected to the general laws of commodity production. 
 In thus concluding the review of the data on the growth of commercial agriculture, we think it not superfluous to repeat here that our aim has been to examine the main (byno means all) forms of commercial agriculture. 
 IX. 
 CONCLUSIONS ON THE SIGNIFICANCE OF CAPITALISM IN RUSSIAN AGRICULTURE In chapters II-IV the problem of capitalism in Russian agriculture has been examined from two angles. 
 First weexamined the existing system of social and economic rela-tions in peasant and landlord economy, the system whichhas taken shape in the post-Reform period. 
 It was seen that the peasantry have been splitting up at enormous speed into a numerically small but economically strong rural bourgeoi-sie and a rural proletariat. 
 Inseparably connected with this“depeasantising” process is the landowners’ transition fromthe labour-service to the capitalist system of farming. 
 Thenwe examined this same process from another angle: we took as our starting-point the manner in which agriculture is transformed into commodity production, and examinedthe social and economic relations characteristic of each of the principal forms of commercial agriculture. 
 It was shownthat the very same processes were conspicuous in both *“Good roads, canals and navigable rivers, by diminishing the expense of carriage, put the remote parts of the country more nearly upon a level with those in the neighbourhood of the town. 
” Op. 
cit. 
, Vol. 
 I, pp. 
 228-229. 
 peasant and private-landowner farming under a great variety of agricultural conditions. 
 Let us now examine the conclusions that follow from all the data given above. 
 1) The main feature of the post-Reform evolution of agri-culture is its growing commercial, entrepreneur character. 
As regards private-landowner farming, this fact is soobvious as to require no special explanation. 
 As regards peas-ant farming, however, it is not so easily established, firstly, because the employment of hired labour is not an abso-lutely essential feature of the small rural bourgeoisie. 
 Aswe have observed above, this category includes every smallcommodity-producer who covers his expenditure by inde-pendent farming, provided the general system of economy is based on the capitalist contradictions examined in Chap-ter II. 
 Secondly, the small rural bourgeois (in Russia, asin other capitalist countries) is connected by a number oftransitional stages with the small-holding “peasant,” andwith the rural proletarian who has been allotted a patchof land. 
 This circumstance is one of the reasons for the viability of the theories which do not distinguish the existence of a rural bourgeoisie and a rural proletariat among“the peasantry. 
” * 2) From the very nature of agriculture its transformation into commodity production proceeds in a special way, un-like the corresponding process in industry. 
 Manufacturing industry splits up into separate, quite independent branches, each devoted exclusively to the manufacture of one productor one part of a product. 
 The agricultural industry,however, does not split up into quite separate branches,but merely specialises in one market product in one case,and in another market product in another, all the other aspects of agriculture being adapted to this principal (i. 
e. 
, market) product. 
 That is why the forms of commercialagriculture show immense diversity, varying not only in *The favourite proposition of the Narodnik economists that “Rus-sian peasant farming is in the majority of cases purely natural econ-omy” is, incidentally, built up by ignoring this fact. 
 ( The Influence of Harvests and Grain Prices , I, 52. 
) One has but to take “average” figures, which lump together both the rural bourgeoisie and the rural proletariat—and this proposition will pass as proved! different areas, but also on different farms. 
 That is why, when examining the question of the growth of commercial agriculture, we must on no account confine ourselves to gross data for agricultural production as a whole. 
 * 3) The growth of commercial agriculture creates a home market for capitalism. 
 Firstly, the specialisation of agri-culture gives rise to exchange between the various agricul-tural areas, between the various agricultural undertakings, and between the various agricultural products. 
 Secondly, the further agriculture is drawn into the sphere of commoditycirculation the more rapid is the growth of the demandmade by the rural population for those products of manufac-turing industry that serve for personal consumption; andthirdly, the more rapid is the growth of the demand for means of production, since neither the small nor the big rural entrepreneur is able, with the old-fashioned “peasant”implements, buildings, etc. 
, etc. 
, to engage in the new,commercial agriculture. 
 Fourthly and lastly, a demand iscreated for labour-power, since the formation of a smallrural bourgeoisie and the change-over by the landowners to capitalist farming presuppose the formation of a body of regular agricultural labourers and day labourers. 
 Only thefact of the growth of commercial agriculture can explain thecircumstance that the post-Reform period is characterised byan expansion of the home market for capitalism (develop-ment of capitalist agriculture, development of factory industry in general, development of the agricultural engineer-*It is to data of this kind that the authors of the book mentioned in the preceding note confine themselves when they speak of “thepeasantry. 
” They assume that every peasant sows just those cereals that he consumes, that he sows all those types of cereals that he con-sumes, and that he sows them in just that proportion in which they are consumed. 
 It does not require much effort to “deduce” from such“assumptions” (which contradict the facts and ignore the mainfeature of the post-Reform period) that natural economy predominates. 
 In Narodnik literature one may also encounter the following ingenious method of argument: each separate type of commercial agriculture is an “exception”—by comparison with agriculture as awhole. 
 Hence , all commercial agriculture in general, it is averred, must be regarded as an exception, and natural economy must be considered the general rule! In college textbooks on logic, in thesection on sophisms, numerous parallels of such lines of reasoning are to be found. 
 ing industry in particular, development of the so-called peasant “agricultural industries,” i. 
e. 
, work for hire, etc. 
). 
 4) Capitalism enormously extends and intensifies among the agricultural population the contradictions withoutwhich this mode of production cannot exist. 
 Notwithstand-ing this, however, agricultural capitalism in Russia, inits historical significance, is a big progressive force. 
 First-ly, capitalism has transformed the cultivator from a “lord of the manor,” on the one hand, and a patriarchal, depend-ent peasant, on the other, into the same sort of industrial-ist that every other proprietor is in present-day society. 
 Before capitalism appeared, agriculture in Russia was thebusiness of the gentry, a lord’s hobby for some, and a duty,an obligation for others; consequently, it could not be conducted except according to age-old routine, necessarily involving the complete isolation of the cultivator from allthat went on in the world beyond the confines of hisvillage. 
 The labour-service system—that living survival ofold times in present-day economy—strikingly confirms thischaracterisation. 
 Capitalism for the first time broke with the system of social estates in land tenure by converting the land into a commodity. 
 The farmer’s product wasput on sale and began to be subject to social reckoning—firstin the local, then in the national, and finally in the inter-national market, and in this way the former isolation ofthe uncouth farmer from the rest of the world was com-pletely broken down. 
 The farmer was compelled willy-nilly, on pain of ruin, to take account of the sum-total of social relations both in his own country and in other coun-tries, now linked together by the world market. 
 Even thelabour-service system, which formerly guaranteed Oblo-mov an assured income without any risk on his part, with-out any expenditure of capital, without any changes inthe age-old routine of production, now proved incapable ofsaving him from the competition of the American farmer. 
That is why one can fully apply to post-Reform Russia whatwas said half a century ago about Western Europe—thatagricultural capitalism hag been “the motive force whichhas drawn the idyll into the movement of history. 
” * *Misère de la philosophie (Paris, 1896), p. 
 223; the author con-temptuously describes as reactionary jeremiads, the longings of those Secondly, agricultural capitalism has for the first time undermined the age-old stagnation of our agriculture;it has given a tremendous impetus to the transformation ofits technique, and to the development of the productiveforces of social labour. 
 A few decades of “destructive work”by capitalism have done more in this respect than entirecenturies of preceding history. 
 The monotony of routinenatural economy has been replaced by a diversity of formsof commercial agriculture; primitive agricultural imple-ments have begun to yield place to improved implementsand machines; the immobility of the old-fashioned farmingsystems has been undermined by new methods of agricul-ture. 
 The course of all these changes is linked inseparablywith the above-mentioned phenomenon of the specialisa-tion of agriculture. 
 By its very nature, capitalism in agri-culture (as in industry) cannot develop evenly: in one place(in one country, in one area, on one farm) it pushes forwardone aspect of agriculture, in another place another aspect,etc. 
 In one case it transforms the technique of some, and in other cases of other agricultural operations, divorcing them from patriarchal peasant economy or from the patri-archal labour-service. 
 Since the whole of this process isguided by market requirements that are capricious and not always known to the producer, capitalist agriculture, in each separate instance (often in each separate area, some-times even in each separate country), becomes more one-sided and lopsided than that which preceded it, but, taken as a whole, becomes immeasurably more many-sided and rational than patriarchal agriculture. 
 The emergence of who thirst for a return to the good old patriarchal life, simple manners, etc. 
, and who condemn the “subjection of the soil to thelaws which dominate all other industries. 
 ”102 We are fully aware that to the Narodniks the whole of the argu-ment given in the text may appear not only unconvincing but posi-tively unintelligible, But it would be too thankless a task to analyse in detail such opinions as, for example, that the purchase-and-saleof the land is an “abnormal” phenomenon (Mr. 
 Chuprov, in the debateon grain prices, p. 
 39 of the verbatim report), that the inalienabilityof the peasants’ allotments is an institution that can be defended, thatthe labour-service system of farming is better, or at all events no worse, than the capitalist system, etc. 
 All that has been said above goes to refute the political and economic arguments advanced by the separate types of commercial agriculture renders possible and inevitable capitalist crises in agriculture and cases ofcapitalist overproduction, but these crises (like all capitalistcrises) give a still more powerful impetus to the develop-ment of world production and of the socialisation of labour. 
 * Thirdly, capitalism has for the first time created in Russia large-scale agricultural production based on the employmentof machines and the extensive co-operation of workers. 
Before capitalism appeared, the production of agricul-tural produce was always carried on in an unchanging, wretch-edly small way—both when the peasant worked for himselfand when he worked for the landlord—and no “communitycharacter” of land tenure was capable of destroying thistremendously scattered production. 
 Inseparably linkedwith this scattered production was the scattered nature of the farmers themselves. 
 ** Tied to their allotment, to their tiny “village community,” they were completelyfenced off even from the peasants of the neighbouring village *The West-European romanticists and Russian Narodniks strongly emphasise in this process the one-sidedness of capitalist agriculture, the instability created by capitalism, and crises—andon this basis deny the progressive character of capitalist advance as compared with pre-capitalist stagnation. 
 **Accordingly, notwithstanding the difference in the forms of land tenure, one can fully apply to the Russian peasant what Marx said of the small French peasant: “The small-holding peasants form a vast mass, the members of which live in similar conditions but with-out entering into manifold relations with one another. 
 Their mode of production isolates them from one another instead of bringing them into mutual intercourse. 
 The isolation is increased by France’s bad means of communication and by the poverty of the peasants. 
Their field of production (Produktionsfeld), the small holding, admits of no division of labour in its cultivation, no application of science and, therefore, no diversity of development, no variety of talent,no wealth of social relationships. 
 Each individual peasant familyis almost self-sufficient, it itself directly produces the major part ofits consumption and thus acquires its means of life more throughexchange with nature than in intercourse with society. 
 A small hold-ing, a peasant and his family; alongside them another small holding, another peasant and another family. 
 A few score of these make up avillage, and a few score of villages make up a Department. 
 In thisway, the great mass of the French nation is formed by simple addi tion of homologous magnitudes, much as potatoes in a sack form a sackof potatoes. 
” ( Der achtzehnte Brumaire des Louis Bonaparte , Hmb. 
, 103 community by the difference in the categories to which they belonged (former landowners’ peasants, former state peasants, etc. 
), by differences in the size of their holdings—by differences in the terms on which theiremancipation took place (which terms were sometimesdetermined simply by the individual attributes of the land-lords and by their whims). 
 Capitalism for the first timebroke down these purely medieval barriers—and it was a very good thing that it did. 
 Now the differences between the various grades of peasants, between the various cate-gories based on the size of allotment holdings, are far lessimportant than the economic differences within each grade,each category and each village community. 
 Capitalismdestroys local seclusion and insularity, and replaces the minute medieval divisions among cultivators by a major division, embracing the whole nation, that divides them intoclasses occupying different positions in the general systemof capitalist economy. 
 * The mass of cultivators were formerly tied to their place of residence by the very conditionsof production, whereas the creation of diverse forms and could not but cause the movement of enormous masses of the population throughout the country; and unless thepopulation is mobile (as we have said above) there can be Fourthly, and lastly, agricultural capitalism in Russia for the first time cut at the root of labour-service and the personal dependency of the farmer. 
 This system oflabour-service has held undivided sway in our agriculture from the days of Russkaya Pravda ** down to the present-day cultivation of the fields of private landowners with the *“The need for association, for organisation in capitalist society, has not diminished but, on the contrary, has grown immeasurably. 
 But it is utterly absurd to measure this need of the new society withthe old yardstick. 
 This new society is already demanding firstly, that the association shall not be according to locality, social-estate or category; secondly, that its starting-point shall be the differencein status and interests that has been created by capitalism and bythe differentiation of the peasantry.

diverse areas of commercial and capitalist agriculture no question of developing its understanding and initiative. 
 peasants’ implements; the wretchedness and uncouthness of the farmer, degraded by his labour being “semi-free” if not feudal, in character, are inevitable concomitants of this system; if the civil rights of the cultivator had notbeen impaired (by, for example, his belonging to the lowestsocial estate; corporal punishment; assignment to publicworks; attachment to allotment, etc. 
) the labour-servicesystem would have been impossible. 
 That is why agricul-tural capitalism in Russia has performed a great historical service in replacing labour-service by hired labour. 
 * Su m-ming up what has been said above on the progressive histor-ical role of Russian agricultural capitalism, it may be saidthat it is socialising agricultural production. 
 Indeed, thefact that agriculture has been transformed from the priv-ileged occupation of the top estate or the duty of the bottom estate into an ordinary commercial and industrialoccupation; that the product of the cultivator’s labour hasbecome subject to social reckoning on the market; thatroutine, uniform agriculture is being converted into techni-cally transformed and diverse forms of commercial farming; that the local seclusion and scattered nature of the small farmers is breaking down; that the diverse forms of bondageand personal dependence are being replaced by imper-sonal transactions in the purchase and sale of labour-power,these are all links in a single process, which is socialisingagricultural labour and is increasingly intensifying the contradiction between the anarchy of market fluctuations, between the individual character of the separate agricul-tural enterprises and the collective character of large-scalecapitalist agriculture. 
 Thus (we repeat once more), in emphasising the progres-sive historical role of capitalism in Russian agriculture *One of Mr. 
 N. 
 —on’s innumerable plaints and lamentations over the destructive work of capitalism in Russia deserves specialattention: “... Neither the strife among the appanage princes nor theTartar invasion affected the forms of our economic life” ( Sketches , p. 
 284); only capitalism has displayed “contempt for its own histor-ical past” (p. 
 283). 
 The sacred truth! Capitalism in Russian agricultureis progressive precisely because it has displayed “contempt” for the“age-old”, “time-hallowed” forms of labour-service and bondage,which, indeed, no political storms, the “strife among the appanageprinces” and the “Tartar invasion” inclusive, were able to destroy. 
 we do not in the least forget either the historically tran-sient character of this economic regime or the profound social contradictions inherent in it. 
 On the contrary, we have shown above that it is precisely the Narodniks who,capable only of bewailing the “destructive work” of capital-ism, give an extremely superficial appraisal of thesecontradictions, glossing over the differentiation of the peas-antry, ignoring the capitalist character of the employment of machinery in our agriculture, and covering up with such expressions as “agricultural industries” and “employments”the emergence of a class of agricultural wage-workers. 
 X. 
 NARODNIK THEORIES ON CAPITALISM IN AGRICULTURE. 
 “THE FREEING OF WINTER TIME” The foregoing positive conclusions regarding the significance of capitalism must be supplemented by an examinationof certain special “theories” on this question currentin our literature. 
 Our Narodniks in most cases have been totally unable to digest Marx’s fundamental views on agri-cultural capitalism. 
 The more candid among them havebluntly declared that Marx’s theory does not cover agricul-ture (Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
 in Our Trends ), while others (like Mr. 
 N. 
 —on) have preferred diplomatically to evade the question ofthe relation between their “postulates” and Marx’s theory. 
 One of the postulates most widespread among the Narodnik economists is the theory of “the freeing of winter time. 
”The essence of it is as follows. 
 * Under the capitalist system agriculture becomes a separate industry, unconnected with the others. 
 However,it is not carried on the whole year but only for five or six months. 
 Therefore, the capitalisation of agriculture leads to “the freeing of winter time,” to the “limitation of the work-ing time of the agricultural class to part of the workingyear,” which is the “fundamental cause of the deteriora-tion of the economic conditions of the agricultural classes” *V. 
 V. 
, Essays on Theoretical Economics , p. 
 108 and foll. 
 N. 
 —on, Sketches, p. 
 214 and foll. 
 The same ideas are to be found in Mr. 
 Kablukov’s Lectures on Agricultural Economics , Moscow, 1897, p. 
 55 and foll. 
 (N. 
 —on, 229), of the “diminishing of the home market” and of “the wastage of the productive forces” of society (Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
). 
 Here you have the whole of this celebrated theory, which bases the most sweeping historical and philosophical conclusions solely on the great truth that in agriculture jobsare distributed over the year very unevenly! To take thisone feature, to reduce it to absurdity by means of abstract assumptions, to discard all the other specific features of the complex process which transforms patriarchal agricul-ture into capitalist agriculture—such are the simplemethods used in this latest attempt to restore the romantictheories about pre-capitalist “people’s production. 
” To show how inordinately narrow this abstract postulate is, let us indicate briefly those aspects of the actual process that are either entirely lost sight of, or are underratedby our Narodniks. 
 Firstly, the further the specialisationof agriculture proceeds, the more the agricultural pop-ulation decreases, becoming an ever-diminishing part ofthe total population. 
 The Narodniks forget this, although in their abstractions they raise the specialisation of agri-culture to a level it hardly ever reaches in actual fact. 
They assume that only the operations of sowing and reap-ing grain have become a separate industry; the cultiva-tion and the manuring of the soil, the processing and thecarting of produce, stock raising, forestry, the repair of buildings and implements, etc. 
, etc. 
—all these operations have been turned into separate capitalist industries. 
 The application of such abstractions to present-day realities willnot contribute much towards explaining them. 
 Secondly,the assumption that agriculture undergoes such completespecialisation presupposes a purely capitalist organisation of agriculture, a complete division into capitalist farmers and wage-workers. 
 To talk under such circumstances about“the peasant” (as Mr. 
 N. 
 —on does, p. 
 215) is the height of illogicality. 
 The purely capitalist organisation of agri-culture presupposes, in its turn, a more even distributionof jobs throughout the year (due to crop rotation, rational stock raising, etc. 
), the combination with agriculture, in many cases, of the technical processing of produce, theapplication of a greater quantity of labour to the preparation of the soil, etc. 
 * Thirdly, capitalism presupposes the com-plete separation of agricultural from industrial enterprises . 
 But whence does it follow that this separation does not permit the combination of agricultural and industrial wage-labour ? We find such a combination in developed capital-ist society everywhere. 
 Capitalism separates the skilledworkers from the plain labourers, the unskilled, who passfrom one occupation to another, now drawn into jobs at some large enterprise, and now thrown into the ranks of the work-less. 
 ** The greater the development of capitalism and large-*To make no bald assertion, let us give examples of our private landowner farms whose organisation approximates in the great-est measure to the purely capitalist type. 
 Let us take Orel Gubernia (Zemstvo Statistical Returns for Kromy Uyezd , Vol. 
 IV, Pt. 
 2, Orel 1892).

 “In the summer the horses and the permanent workers are busy round the fields; in late autumn and partly in winter they cart potatoes and starch to the drying sheds and starch factory, and also cart timber from the woods to the ... station; thanksto all this, the work is spread fairly evenly now over the whole year”(p. 
 145), as is evident, incidentally, from the register showing thenumber of days worked monthly: average number of horse days,293 per month; fluctuations: from 223 (April) to 362 (June). 
 Average male days, 216; fluctuations: from 126 (February) to 279 (November). 
 Average female days 23; fluctuations: from 13 (January) to 27 (March). 
Is this reality anything like the abstraction the Narodniks are busyingthemselves with? **Large-scale capitalist industry creates a nomad working class. 
 It is formed from the rural population, but is chiefly engaged in industrial occupations. 
 “They are the light infantry of capital, thrown labour is used for various operations of building and draining, brick-by it, according to its needs, now to this point, now to that. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 Nomad scale industry, the greater, in general, are the fluctuations in the demand for workers not only in agriculture, but also in industry. 
 * Therefore, if we presuppose the maximum development of capitalism, we must also presuppose the maxi-mum facility for the transfer of workers from agriculturalto non-agricultural occupations, we must presuppose theformation of a general reserve army from which labour-power is drawn by all sorts of employers. 
 Fourthly, if we take the present-day rural employers, it cannot, of course, be denied that sometimes they experience difficulty in providing their farms with workers. 
 But it must not be for-gotten, either, that they have a means of tying the workers to their farms, namely, by allotting them patches of land, etc. 
 The allotment-holding farm labourer or day labourer is a type common to all capitalist countries. 
 One of the chief errors of the Narodniks is that they ignore the forma-tion of a similar type in Russia. 
 Fifthly, it is quite wrong to discuss the freeing of the farmer’s winter time inde-pendently of the general question of capitalist surplus-population. 
 The formation of a reserve army of unemployed is characteristic of capitalism in general, and the specific features of agriculture merely give rise to special forms of this phenomenon. 
 That is why the author of Capital , for instance, deals with the distribution of employment in agri-culture in connection with the question of “relative surplus-population,” ** as well as in a special chapter where he 692104. 
) “In general such large-scale undertakings as railways with-draw a definite quantity of labour-power from the labour-market,which can come only from certain branches of economy, for example,agriculture ...” (ibid. 
, II. 
 B. 
, S. 
 303) . 
105 *For example the Moscow Medical Statistics placed the number of factory workers in this gubernia at 114,381; this was the number atwork; the highest figure was 146,338 and the lowest, 94,214 ( General Summary , etc. 
, Vol. 
 IV, Pt. 
 I, p. 
 98); in percentages: 128%—100%— 82%. 
 By increasing, in general, the fluctuations in the number ofworkers, capitalism evens out, in this respect too, the differences between industry and agriculture. 
 **For example, in regard to the agricultural relations of England, Marx says: “There are always too many agricultural labourers for theordinary, and always too few for the exceptional or temporary needsof the cultivation of the soil” (I 2, 725), 106 so that, notwithstanding the permanent “relative surplus-population,” the countryside seems to be inadequately populated. 
 As capitalist production takes discusses the difference between the “working period” and the “time of production” ( Das Kapital , II. 
 B. 
, Chapter 13). 
 The working period is the period in which labour is applied to the product; the time of production is the time duringwhich the product is in production, including the periodin which labour is not applied to it. 
 The working perioddoes not coincide with the time of production in very manyindustries, among which agriculture is merely the most typical, but by no means the only one. 
 * In Russia, as com-pared with other European countries, the differencebetween the working period in agriculture and the time ofproduction is a particularly big one. 
 “When capitalist pro-duction later accomplishes the separation of manufactureand agriculture, the rural labourer becomes ever more dependent on merely casual accessory employment and his condition deteriorates thereby. 
 For capital . 
 . 
 . 
 all differ-ences in the turnover are evened out. 
 Not so for the labourer”(ibid. 
, 223-224). 
 109 So then, the only conclusion that fol-lows from the specific features of agriculture in the instanceunder review is that the position of the agricultural workermust be even worse than that of the industrial worker. 
This is still a very long way from Mr. 
 N. 
 —on’s “theory” that the freeing of winter time is the “fundamental reason”for the deterioration of the conditions of the “agriculturalclasses” (?!). 
 If the working period in our agriculture equalled12 months, the process of the development of capitalism would go on exactly as it does now; the entire differencewould be that the conditions of the agricultural worker would come somewhat closer to those of the industrial worker. 
 ** population is formed. 
 “Part of the agricultural population is therefore constantly on the point of passing over into an urban or manufactur-ing proletariat” (ibid. 
, 668)107; this part of the population suffers chronically from unemployment; the work it gets is extremely irregu-lar and is the worst paid (e. 
g. 
, working at home for shops, etc. 
) *Particularly noteworthy in this connection is Marx’s obser-vation that in agriculture too there are ways of distributing the demand for labour more evenly over the entire year,” namely, by raising a greater variety of products, by substituting crop rotation for the three-field system, cultivating root-crops, grasses, etc. 
 But all these methods“require an increase of the circulating capital advanced in produc-tion, invested in wages, fertilisers, seed, etc. 
” (ibid. 
, S. 
 225-226). 
 108 **We say “somewhat,” because the deterioration of the conditions of the agricultural worker is far from being due to irregularity of Thus the “theory” of Messrs. 
 V. 
 V. 
 and N. 
 —on makes abso-lutely no contribution whatever even to the general problem of the development of agricultural capitalism. 
 As for the specific features of Russia, it not only does not explainthem, but on the contrary obscures them. 
 Winter unemploy-ment among our peasantry depends not so much on capital-ism as on the inadequate development of capitalism. 
We have shown above (§IV of this chapter), from the data on wages, that of the Great-Russian gubernias, winter unemployment is most prevalent in those where capi-talism is least developed and where labour-service prevails. 
That is quite understandable. 
 Labour-service retards thedevelopment of labour productivity, retards the devel-opment of industry and agriculture, and, consequently, the demand for labour-power, and at the same time, while tying the peasant to his allotment, provides him neitherwith employment in winter time nor with the possibilityof existing by his wretched farming. 
 XI. 
 CONTINUATION. 
— THE VILLAGE COMMUNITY. 
— ’S VIEWS ON SMALL-SCALE AGRICULTURE. 
— ENGELS’S OPINION OF THE CONTEMPORARY AGRICULTURAL CRISIS “The community principle prevents capital from seizing agricultural production,”—that is how Mr. 
 N. 
 —on (p. 
 72) expresses another current Narodnik theory, formulated injust as abstract a fashion as the previous one. 
 In Chap-ter II we quoted a series of facts showing the fallacy of this stock premise. 
 Now let us add the following. 
 It isa great mistake to think that the inception of agricul-tural capitalism itself requires some special-form of land tenure. 
 “But the form of landed property with which the incipient capitalist mode of production is confronted does not suit it. 
 It first creates for itself the form required by subordinating agriculture to capital. 
 It thus transforms feudal landed property, clan property, small-peasant prop-erty in mark communes * (Markgemeinschaft)—no matter *In another place Marx points out that “common lands (Gemein-eigentum) constitute the second supplement of the management of how divergent their juristic forms may be—into the eco-nomic form corresponding to the requirements of this mode of production” ( Das Kapital , III, 2, 156). 
 Thus, by the very nature of the case, no peculiarities in the system of landtenure can serve as an insurmountable obstacle to capitalism,which assumes different forms in accordance with the differ-ent conditions in agriculture, legal relationships and mannerof life. 
 One can see from this how wrong is the very pres-entation of the question by our Narodniks, who have created a whole literature on the subject of “village community or capitalism?” Should some Anglomaniac aristocrat happento offer a prize for the best work on the introduction ofcapitalist farming in Russia, should some learned societycome forward with a scheme to settle peasants on farm-steads, should some idle government official concoct a project for 60-dessiatine holdings, the Narodnik hastens tothrow down the gauntlet and fling himself into the frayagainst these “bourgeois projects” to “introduce capitalism ” and destroy that Palladium of “people’s industry,” the village community. 
 It has never entered the head of our good Narodnik that capitalism has been proceeding on its way while all sorts of projects have been drafted and refuted, and thecommunity village has been turning, and has actuallyturned, * into the village of small agrarians. 
 That is why we are very indifferent to the question of the form of peasant land tenure. 
 Whatever the form of land tenure may be, the relation between the peasant bourgeoi-sie and the rural proletariat will not undergo any essentialchange. 
 The really important question concerns not theform of land tenure at all, but the remnants of the purely *If we are told that we are running ahead in making such an assertion, our reply will be the following. 
 Whoever wants to depictsome living phenomenon in its development is inevitably and neces-sarily confronted with the dilemma of either running ahead or laggingbehind. 
 There is no middle course. 
 And if all the facts show that the character of the social evolution is precisely such that this evolution has already gone very far (see Chapter II), and if, furthermore,precise reference is made to the circumstances and institutions thatretard this evolution (excessively high taxes, social-estate exclusive-ness of the peasantry, lack of full freedom in the purchase and saleof land, and in movement and settlement), then there is nothing wrong in such running ahead. 
 medieval past, which continue to weigh down upon the peasantry—the social-estate seclusion of the peasant communities, collective responsibility, excessively high taxation of peasant land out of all proportion to the taxationof privately-held land, the absence of full freedom inthe purchase and sale of peasant lands, and in the movementand settlement of the peasantry. 
 * All these obsolete insti-tutions, while not in the least safeguarding the peasantry against break-up, only lead to the multiplication of diverse forms of labour-service and bondage, to tremendousdelay in social development as a whole. 
 In conclusion we must deal with an original Narodnik attempt to give an interpretation to some statements madeby Marx and Engels in Volume III of Capital , in favour of their views that small-scale agriculture is superior to large-scale, and that agricultural capitalism does not playa progressive historical role. 
 Quite often, with this end inview, they quote the following passage from Volume IIIof Capital : “The moral of history, also to be deduced from other observations concerning agriculture, is that the capitalist system works against a rational agriculture, or that arational agriculture is incompatible with the capitalistsystem (although the latter promotes technical improvementsin agriculture), and needs either the hand of the small farmerliving by his own labour (selbst arbeitenden) or the control of associated producers” (III, 1, 98. 
 Russ. 
 trans. 
, 83). 
 111 What follows from this assertion (which, let us note in passing, is an absolutely isolated fragment that has foundits way into a chapter dealing with the way changes in theprices of raw materials affect profits, and not into Part VI, which deals specifically with agriculture)? That capitalism is incompatible with the rational organisation of agricul-ture (as also of industry) has long been known; nor isthat the point at issue with the Narodniks. 
 And the pro-gressive historical role of capitalism in agriculture is *The defence of some of these institutions by the Narodniks very glaringly reveals the reactionary character of their views, which is gradually bringing them closer and closer to the agrarians. 
 especially emphasised by Marx here. 
 There remains Marx’s reference to the “small peasant living by his own labour. 
” None of the Narodniks who have referred to this point has taken the trouble to explain how he understands this, hastaken the trouble to connect this point with the context, onthe one hand, and with Marx’s general theory of small-scaleagriculture, on the other. 
—In the passage quoted from Cap-ital the point dealt with is how considerably the prices of raw materials fluctuate, how these fluctuations disturb the proportionality and systematic working of production,how they disturb the conformity of agriculture and indus-try. 
 It is only in this respect —in respect of the propor-tionality, systematic working and planned operation of pro-duction—that Marx places small peasant economy on a par with the economy of “associated producers. 
” In this respect, even small medieval industry (handicraft) is similarto the economy of “associated producers” (cf. 
 Misère de la philosophie , edition cited, p. 
 90), whereas capitalism differs from both these systems of social economy in its anarchyof production. 
 By what logic can one draw the conclusion from this that Marx admitted the viability of small-scale agriculture, * that he did not acknowledge the progressive historical role of capitalism in agriculture? Here is whatMarx said about this in the special part dealing with agri-culture, in the special section on small peasant economy (Chapter 47, §V): “Proprietorship of land parcels by its very nature excludes the development of social productive forces oflabour, social forms of labour, social concentration of capital,large-scale cattle raising, and the progressive applicationof science. 
 “Usury and a taxation system must impoverish it every-where. 
 The expenditure of capital in the price of the land withdraws this capital from cultivation. 
 An infinite frag-mentation of means of production, and isolation of the pro-ducers themselves. 
 Monstrous waste of human energy. 
 *Let us recall that Engels, shortly before his death, and at a time when the agricultural crisis connected with the drop in prices was fully manifest, considered it necessary to protest emphatically against the French “disciples,” who had made some concessions tothe doctrine of the viability of small-scale agriculture. 
 112 Progressive deterioration of conditions of production and increased prices of means of production—an inevitable law of proprietorship of parcels. 
 Calamity of seasonal abundance for this mode of production” (III, 2, 341-342. 
 Russ. 
 trans. 
,667). 
 113 “Small landed property presupposes that the overwhelm-ing majority of the population is rural, and that not social,but isolated labour predominates; and that, therefore, under such conditions wealth and development of reproduc-tion, both of its material and spiritual prerequisites,are out of the question, and thereby also the prerequi-sites for rational cultivation” (III, 2, 347. 
 Russ. 
 trans. 
,p. 
 672). 
 114 The writer of these lines, far from closing his eyes to the contradictions inherent in large-scale capitalist agricul-ture, ruthlessly exposed them. 
 But this did not prevent himfrom appreciating the historical role of capitalism: “ . 
 . 
 . 
 One of the major results of the capitalist mode of production is that, on the one hand, it transforms agriculturefrom a mere empirical and mechanical self-perpetuating process employed by the least developed part of society into the conscious scientific application of agronomy, inso far as this is at all feasible under conditions of privateproperty; that it divorces landed property from the rela-tions of dominion and servitude, on the one hand, and, onthe other, totally separates land as an instrument of produc-tion from landed property and landowner. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 The rational-ising of agriculture, on the one hand, which makes it forthe first time capable of operating on a social scale, andthe reduction ad absurdum of property in land, on the other,are the great achievements of the capitalist mode ofproduction. 
 Like all of its other historical advances, it also attained these by first completely impoverishing the direct producers” (III, 2, 156-157. 
 Russ. 
 trans. 
, 509-510). 
 115 One would think that after such categorical statements by Marx there could be no two opinions as to how he viewedthe question of the progressive historical role of agricul-tural capitalism. 
 Mr. 
 N. 
 —on, however, found one more subterfuge: he quoted Engels’s opinion on the present agricul-tural crisis, which should, in his view, refute the proposition of the progressive role of capitalism in agricul-ture. 
 * Let us see what Engels actually says. 
 After summarising the main propositions of Marx’s theory of differential rent, Engels establishes the law that “the more capital is invested in the land, and the higher the development of agriculture and civilisation in general in a given country, the more rents rise per acre as well as in total amount, and the more immense becomes the tribute paid by society to the big landowners in the form of surplus-profits” ( Das Kapital , III, 2, 258. 
 Russ. 
 trans. 
, 597). 
116 This law, says Engels, explains “the wonderful vitality of the class of big landowners,” who accumulate a mass of debts and never-theless “land on their feet” in all crises; for example, the abo-lition of the Corn Laws in England, which caused a drop in grain prices, far from ruining the landlords, exceedingly enriched them. 
 It might thus seem that capitalism is unable to weaken the power of the monopoly represented by landed property. 
 “But everything is transitory,” continues Engels. 
 “Trans-oceanic steamships and the railways of North and SouthAmerica and India” called forth new competitors. 
 The North American prairies and the Argentine pampas, etc. 
, flooded the world market with cheap grain. 
 “And in face of this competition—coming from virgin plains as well as from Russian and Indian peasants ground down by taxation— the European tenant farmer and peasant could not prevail *See Novoye Slovo , 1896, No. 
 5, February, letter to editors by Mr. 
 N. 
 —on, pp. 
 256-261. 
 Here also is the “quotation” on the “moral of history. 
” It is remarkable that neither Mr. 
 N. 
 —on nor any other of the numerous Narodnik economists who have tried to use the pres-ent agricultural crisis to refute the theory of the progressive histor-ical role of capitalism in agriculture, has ever once raised the ques-tion in a straightforward manner, on the basis of a definite economictheory; has ever once stated the grounds which induced Marx toadmit the progressiveness of the historical role of agricultural capi-talism, or has definitely indicated just which of these grounds herepudiates, and why. 
 In this, as in other cases, the Narodnikeconomists prefer not to oppose Marx’s theory outright, but confinethemselves to casting vague hints at the “Russian disciples. 
” Confiningourselves in this work to the economy of Russia, we have given abovethe grounds for our opinions on this question. 
 at the old rents. 
 A portion of the land in Europe fell deci-sively out of competition as regards grain cultivation, and rents fell everywhere; our second case, variant 2—falling prices and falling productivity of the additional invest-ment of capital—became the rule for Europe; and there-fore the lament of landlords from Scotland to Italy and from the south of France to the east of Prussia. 
 Fortunately, the plains are far from being entirely brought under cultivation; there are enough left to ruin all the big landlords of Europe and the small ones into the bargain” (ibid. 
, 260. 
 Russ. 
 trans. 
, 598, where the word “fortunately” is omitted. 
)117 If the reader has read this passage carefully it should be clear to him that Engels says the very opposite of what Mr. 
 N. 
 —on wants to foist on him. 
 In Engels’s opinion the present agricultural crisis is reducing rent and is even tend-ing to abolish it altogether; in other words, agricultural capitalism is pursuing its natural tendency to abolish the monopoly of landed property. 
 No, Mr. 
 N. 
 —on is posi-tively out of luck with his “quotations. 
” Agricultural capitalism is taking another, enormous step forward; it is boundlessly expanding the commercial production of agricul-tural produce and drawing a number of new countries into the world arena; it is driving patriarchal agriculture out of its last refuges, such as India or Russia; it is creating some-thing hitherto unknown to agriculture, namely, the purely industrial production of grain, based on the co-operation of masses of workers equipped with the most up-to-date machinery; it is tremendously aggravating the position of the old European countries, reducing rents, thus undermin-ing what seemed to be the most firmly established monop-olies and reducing landed property “to absurdity” not only in theory, but also in practice; it is raising so vividly the need to socialise agricultural production that this need is beginning to be realised in the West even by representa-tives of the propertied classes. 
 * And Engels, with his char-acteristic cheerful irony, welcomes the latest steps of world *Are not, indeed, such manifestations as the celebrated Antrag Kanitz (Kanitz plan— Ed. 
) proposed in the German Reichstag, 118 or the proposal of the American farmers that all elevators be made state property typical signs of the times”? capitalism: fortunately, he says, there is still enough uncul-tivated prairie land left to enable things to continue as they have been doing.

O, sancta simplicitas! *Without rhyme or reason. 
— Ed. 
 C H A P T E R V THE FIRST STAGES OF CAPITALISM IN INDUSTRY Let us now pass from agriculture to industry. 
 Here, too, our task is formulated as in the case of agriculture: we have to analyse the forms of industry in post-Reform Russia,that is, to study the present system of social and economicrelations in manufacturing industry and the character ofthe evolution of that system. 
 Let us start with the mostsimple and primitive forms of industry and trace their development. 
 I. 
 DOMESTIC INDUSTRY AND HANDICRAFTS By domestic industry we mean the processing of raw materials in the household (peasant family) that produces them. 
 Domestic industries are a necessary adjunct of natu-ral economy, remnants of which are nearly always retainedwhere there is a small peasantry. 
 It is natural, therefore,that in Russian economic literature one should meet repeatedreferences to this type of industry (the domestic productionof articles from flax, hemp, wood, etc. 
, for consumption in the home). 
 However, the existence of domestic industry on any extensive scale is rarely found nowadays andonly in the most remote localities; until very recently,Siberia, for example, was one of them. 
 Industry as a profes-sion does not yet exist in this form: industry here is linkedinseparably with agriculture, together they constitute a single whole. 
 The first form of industry to be separated from patriar-chal agriculture is artisan production, i. 
e. 
, the production of articles to the order of a consumer. 
 * The raw materials may belong either to the customer-consumer or to the arti-san, and payment for the latter’s work is made either in cash or in kind (artisan’s premises and keep, remuneration with part of the product, for example, flour, etc. 
). 
 While constituting an essential part of urban life, artisan produc-tion is to be met on a considerable scale in the rural dis-tricts too, where it serves as a supplement to peasant farm-ing. 
 A certain percentage of the rural population consists of specialist-artisans engaged (sometimes exclusively, sometimes in conjunction with agriculture) in tanning, boot-making, tailoring, blacksmithery, dyeing of homespun fabrics, finishing of peasant-made woollens, flour-milling, etc. 
 Owing to the extremely unsatisfactory state of our eco-nomic statistics we have no precise data on the degree to which artisan production is spread throughout Russia; but isolated references to this form of industry are scat-tered through nearly all descriptions of peasant farming and investigations of what is called “handicraft” industry, ** and are even to be found in official factory statistics. 
 *** The Zemstvo statistical returns, in registering peasantindustries, sometimes single out a special group, “arti-sans” (cf. 
 Rudnev, loc. 
 cit. 
), but this category (according *Kundenproduktion. 
 Cf. 
 Karl Bücher, Die Entstehung der Volkswirtschaft , Tübingen, 1893. 
 (Work done to order. 
 Cf. 
 Karl Bücher, The Rise of the National Economy . 
—Ed. 
)119 **It would be impossible to cite quotations in support of this: innumerable references to artisan production are scattered throughoutall investigations of handicraft industry, although according to themost accepted view, artisans do not come within the category known as handicraftsmen. 
 We shall have more than one occasion to see how hopelessly indefinite is the term “handicraft. 
” *** The chaotic condition of these statistics is illustrated par-ticularly vividly by the fact that no criteria have yet been decidedon for distinguishing handicraft from factory establishments. 
 Inthe 60s, for example, village dyeing sheds of a purely handicraft type were classified with the latter ( The Ministry of Finance Yearbook , Vol. 
 I, pp. 
 172-176), and in 1890, peasant fulling mills were mixedup with woollen factories (Orlov’s Directory of Factories and Works , 3rd ed. 
, p. 
 21), etc. 
 Nor is the latest List of Factories (St. 
 Petersburg, 1897) free from this confusion. 
 For examples, see our Studies , pp. 
 270-271. 
 [See also present edition, Vol, 4, “On the Question of Our Factory Statistics. 
”— Ed. 
] /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR to current terminology) includes all building workers. 
 From the viewpoint of political economy this is utterly wrong, for the bulk of the building workers belong to the category, not of independent industrialists working on orders from customers, but of wage-workers employed by con-tractors. 
 Of course, it is not always easy to distinguish the village-artisan from the small commodity-producer or from the wage-worker; this requires an economic analysis of the data concerning every small industrialist. 
 A noteworthy attempt to draw a strict line of demarcation between arti-san production and the other forms of small industry is the analysis of the returns of the Perm handicraft census of 1894-95. 
 * The number of local village artisans was estimated at approximately one per cent of the peasant population, and (as might have been expected) the largest percentage of artisans was found in the uyezds where industry was least developed. 
 As compared with the small commodity-producers, the artisans are more closely connected with the land: 80. 
6 per 100 artisans engage in agriculture (among the other “handicraftsmen” the percentage is lower). 
 The employment of wage-labour is met with among artisans too,but is less developed among industrialists of this type than among the others. 
 The size of establishments (taking the number of workers) is also smaller among the artisans. 
 The average earnings of the artisan-cultivator are estimated at 43. 
9 rubles per year, and of the non-cultivator at 102. 
9 rubles. 
 We confine ourselves to these brief remarks, since a detailed examination of artisan production does not enter into our task. 
 In this form of industry commodity production does not yet exist; here only commodity circulation makes its appearance, in the case where the artisan receives pay-ment in money, or sells the share of the product he has received for work done and buys himself raw materials and instruments of production. 
 The product of the artisan’s *We have devoted a special article to this census in our Studies, pp. 
 113-199. 
 (See present edition, Vol. 
 2, The Handicraft Census of 1894-95 in Perm Gubernia and General Problems of “Handicraft ” Industry . 
—Ed. 
) All the facts cited in the text concerning the Perm “handicraftsmen” are taken from that article. 
 labour does not appear in the market, hardly ever leaving the sphere of peasant natural economy. 
 * It is natural, there-fore, that artisan production is characterised by the same routine, fragmentation and narrowness as small patri-archal agriculture. 
 The only element of development nativeto this form of industry is the migration of artisans to otherareas in search of employment. 
 Such migration was fairlywidely developed, particularly in the old days, in our rural districts; usually it led to the organisation of independ-ent artisan establishments in the areas of attraction. 
 II. 
 SMALL COMMODITY-PRODUCERS IN INDUSTRY. 
 THE CRAFT SPIRIT IN THE SMALL INDUSTRIES We have seen that the artisan appears on the market, although not with the wares he produces. 
 Naturally,once he comes into contact with the market, he begins intime to produce for the market, i. 
e. 
, becomes a commodity-producer . 
 This transition takes place gradually, at first as an experiment: goods are sold which are left on his hands by chance, or are produced in his spare time. 
 The gradual-ness of the transition is heightened by the fact that the marketfor wares is at first extremely restricted, so that the dis-tance between the producer and the consumer increases veryslightly, and the product passes as hitherto directly from the producer to the consumer, its sale sometimes being preceded by its exchange for agricultural produce. 
 ** The further *The closeness of artisan production to the natural economy of the peasants sometimes leads to attempts on their part to organisesuch production for the whole village, the peasants providing the artisan with his keep, he undertaking to work for all the inhabitants of the village concerned. 
 Nowadays this system of industry is to bemet with only by way of exception, or in the most remote borderregions (for example, the blacksmith’s trade is organised on theselines in some of the villages in Transcaucasia. 
 See Reports and Investigations of Handicraft Industry in Russia , Vol. 
 II, p. 
 321). 
 **E.

, the exchange of earthenware utensils for grain, etc. 
 When grain was cheap the equivalent of a pot was sometimes con-sidered to be the amount of grain the pot would hold.

 development of commodity production is expressed in the expansion of commerce in the appearance of specialist-merchants, buyers-up; the market for wares is not thesmall village bazaar or the district fair, * but the whole region, then the whole country, and sometimes even othercountries. 
 The production of industrial wares in the shape of commodities is the first step to the separation of industry from agriculture, and to mutual exchange between them. 
Mr. 
 N. 
 —on, with his characteristically stereotyped and abstract way of understanding things, limits himself todeclaring that the “separation of industry from agriculture”is a quality of “capitalism” in general, without taking the trouble to examine either the different forms of this sepa-ration or the different stages of capitalism. 
 It is importantto note, therefore, that commodity production on the small-est scale in the peasant industries already begins to sepa-rate industry from agriculture, although at that stage ofdevelopment the industrialist does not, in the majority of cases, separate from the agriculturist. 
 Later on we shall show how the more developed stages of capitalism lead to theseparation of industrial from agricultural enterprises, tothe separation of industrial workers from agriculturists. 
 In the rudimentary forms of commodity production, com-petition among the “handicraftsmen” is still very slight, but as the market expands and embraces wide areas, this com-petition grows steadily stronger and disturbs the smallindustrialist’s patriarchal prosperity, the basis of whichis his virtually monopolist position. 
 The small commodity-producer feels that his interests, as opposed to the interests of the rest of society, demand the preservation of this monop-olist position, and he therefore fears competition. 
 He exerts every effort, individually and with others, to check compe-tition, “not to let” rivals into his district, and to consoli-date his assured position as a small master possessing a *An investigation of one of these country fairs showed that 31% of the total turnover (about 15,000 rubles out of 50,000 rubles) wasaccounted for by “handicraft” goods. 
 See Transactions of the Handi-craft Commission , I, 38. 
 How restricted the market is at first for the small commodity-producers is seen, for example, from the factthat the Poltava boot-makers sell their wares within a radius of some60 vorsts from their village, Reports and Investigations , I, 287. 
 definite circle of customers. 
 This fear of competition so strik-ingly reveals the true social nature of the small commodity-producer that we think it necessary to examine the relative facts in greater detail. 
 In the first place, let us quote an exam-ple relative to handicraft. 
 The Kaluga sheepskin dressers gooff to other gubernias to treat sheepskins; this industry hasdeclined since the abolition of serfdom; the landlords, whenthey released serfs for “sheepskinning,” in return for a siza-ble tribute, took great care that the sheepskinners knew their “definite places” and did not permit other dressers to invadetheir districts. 
 Organised on these lines the industry wasso profitable that “places” were transferred for as muchas 500 and 1,000 rubles, and if an artisan came to adistrict other than his own, it sometimes led to sanguinary clashes. 
 The abolition of serfdom undermined this medieval prosperity: “the convenience of railway travel in this casealso aids competition. 
” * One of the phenomena of the same type observed in a number of industries and bearing fullythe character of a general rule, is the desire of the smallindustrialists to keep technical inventions and improvements secret, to conceal profitable occupations from others, in order to stave off “fatal competition. 
” Those who establisha new industry or introduce some improvement in an oldone, do their utmost to conceal these profitable occupationsfrom their fellow-villagers and resort to all sorts of devicesfor this purpose (e. 
g. 
, as a make-believe they keep the old arrangements in the establishment), let no one enter their workshops, work in garrets and say nothing about their workeven to their own children.

 brush-making industry in Moscow Gubernia “is usually attributed to the present producers’ objection to having new competitors. 
 It is said that they do all they can to con-ceal their work from strangers, and so only one producerhas apprentices from outside. 
” * Concerning the village of Bezvodnoye, Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia, famous for itsmetalware industry, we read the following: “It is remarkablethat to this day” (the beginning of the 80s; the industry has existed since the beginning of the 50s) “the inhabitants of Bezvodnoye carefully conceal their craft from the neigh-bouring peasants. 
 They have made more than one attemptto induce the volost administration to issue an instructionmaking it a punishable offence to carry the craft toanother village; though they have failed to get this formal-ity adopted, each of them seems to be morally bound by such an instruction, in virtue of which they refrain fromgiving their daughters in marriage to inhabitants of neigh-bouring villages, and as far as possible avoid taking girlsin marriage from those villages. 
” ** The Narodnik economists have not only tried to obscure the fact that the bulk of the small peasant industrialists belong to the category of commodity-producers, but haveeven created quite a legend about some profound antagonismallegedly existing between the economic organisation of thesmall peasant industries and large-scale industry. 
 Theunsoundness of this view is also evident, by the way, from the above-quoted data. 
 If the big industrialist stops at nothing to ensure himself a monopoly, the peasant engagingin “handicrafts” is in this respect his twin brother; the pettybourgeois endeavours with his petty resources to upholdsubstantially the same class interests the big manufacturerseeks to protect when he clamours for protection, bonuses,-privileges, etc.

 *** Sensing that competition will be fatal to him, the petty bourgeois strives to stave it off, just as his ideologist, the Narodnik,senses that capitalism is fatal to the “foundations” so dear to his heart,and for that reason strives to “avert,” to prevent, to stave off,etc. 
, etc. 
 III. 
 THE GROWTH OF SMALL INDUSTRIES AFTER THE REFORM. 
 TWO FORMS OF THIS PROCESS AND ITS SIGNIFICANCE From the foregoing there also emerge the following features of small production that merit attention. 
 Theappearance of a new industry signifies, as we have alreadyobserved, a process of growing social division of labour. 
 Hence, such a process must necessarily take place in every capitalist society, to the extent that a peasantry and semi-natural agriculture still remain to one degree or other, andto the extent that diverse ancient institutions and traditions(due to bad means of communication, etc. 
) prevent large-scale machine industry from directly replacing domestic industry. 
 Every step in the development of commodity economy inevitably leads to the peasantry producing anever-increasing number of industrialists from their ranks;this process turns up new soil, as it were, prepares newregions in the most backward parts of the country, or newspheres in the most backward branches of industry, for subsequent seizure by capitalism. 
 The very same growth of capitalism manifests itself in other parts of the country,or in other branches of industry, in an entirely differentway; not in an increase but in a decrease in the number ofsmall workshops and of home workers absorbed by the fac-tory. 
 It is clear that a study of the development of capital-ism in the industry of a given country requires that the strictest distinction be made between these processes; tomix them up is to lead to an utter confusion of concepts. 
 * *Here is an interesting example of how these two different processes occur in one and the same gubernia, at one and the same time and in one and the same industry. 
 The spinning-wheelindustry (in Vyatka Gubernia) is ancillary to the domestic productionof fabrics. 
 The development of this industry marks the rise of commodityproduction, which embraces the making of one of the instrumentsfor the production of fabrics. 
 Well, we see that in the remote parts of the gubernia, in the north, the spinning wheel is almost unknown (Material for a Description of the Industries of Vyatka Gubernia , II, 27) and there “the industry might newly emerge,” i. 
e. 
, might makethe first breach in the patriarchal natural economy of the peasants. 
Meanwhile, in other parts of the gubernia this industry is alreadydeclining, and the investigators believe that the probable cause of the decline is “the increasingly widespread use among the peasantry In post-Reform Russia the growth of small industries, expressing the first steps in the development of capital-ism, has manifested, and manifests, itself in two ways: firstly, in the migration of small industrialists and handi-craftsmen from the central, long-settled and economicallymost advanced gubernias, to the outer regions; secondly,in the formation of new small industries and the spread ofpreviously existing industries among the local population. 
 The first of these processes is one of the manifestations of the colonisation of the border regions to which we havereferred (Chapter IV, §II). 
 The peasant industrialistin the Nizhni-Novgorod, Vladimir, Tver, Kaluga and othergubernias, sensing the increased competition accompanyingthe growth of the population, and the growth of capitalist manufacture and of the factory that constitute a menace to small production, leaves for the South, where “artisans”are still few, earnings high and the living cost low. 
 Inthe new locality a small establishment was set up whichlaid the foundations for a new peasant industry that spreadlater in the village concerned and in its environs. 
 The cen-tral districts of the country, possessing an industrial culture of long standing, thus helped the development of the sameculture in new parts of the country, where settlement wasbeginning. 
 Capitalist relations (which, as we shall see below,are also characteristic of the small peasant industries)were thus carried to the entire country. 
 * Let us pass to the facts that express the second of the above-mentioned processes. 
 We shall first say that although of factory-made cotton fabrics” (p 26). 
 Here, consequently, the growth of commodity production and of capitalism is manifested in theelimination of petty industry by the factory. 
 *See, for example, S. 
 A. 
 Korolenko, loc. 
 cit.

 we note the growth of small peasant establishments and industries, we do not as yet deal with their economic organisation: from what follows it will be evident that these industries either lead to the formation of capitalist simpleco-operation and merchant’s capital or constitute a compo-nent part of capitalist manufacture. 
 The fur industry in Arzamas Uyezd, Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia, began in the town of Arzamas and then gradually spread to the surrounding villages, embracing an ever larger area. 
 At first there were few furriers in the villages andthey employed numerous workers; labour was cheap, sincepeople hired themselves out in order to learn the trade. 
After learning it they left and opened small establishmentsof their own, thus preparing a wider field for the domina-tion of capital, which now controls a large section of the industrialists. 
 * Let us note in general that this abundance of wage-workers in the first establishments of a rising industry and the subsequent transformation of these wage-workers into small masters is a very widespread phenomenon, bearing the character of a general rule. 
 ** Obviously, it would be a profound error to deduce from this that “in spite of various historical considerations . 
 . 
 . 
 it is not big establish-ments that absorb small ones, but small ones that grow out of big ones. 
” *** The large size of the first establishments expresses no concentration of the industry; it is explained by the solitary character of these establishments and by the eagerness of local peasants to learn a profitable trade in them. 
 As to the process of the spread of peasant indus-tries from their old centres to the surrounding villages, it is observed in many cases. 
 For example, the post-Reform period saw the development (as regards the number of vil-lages involved in industry, the number of industrialists, and the total output) of the following exceptionally important *Transactions of the Handicraft Commission , III. 
 **For example, the same thing has been noted in the dyeing industry of Moscow Gubernia ( Industries of Moscow Gubernia , VI, I, 73-99), in the hat (ibid.

 I), in the fur (ibid.

 * The author of an article on handicraft industries in seven volosts of Tula Uyezd notes as a general phenomenon “an increase in the number of artisans since the peasantReform,” “the appearance of artisans and handicraftsmen inplaces where there were none in pre-Reform times. 
” ** A similar view is expressed by Moscow statisticians.

 **** The data on the brush, pin, hook, hat, starch, boot, spectacle frame, harness, fringe and furniture industries have beenselected from the handicraft house-to-house census material quotedTotal num-ber of estab-lishments Similarly, the Perm handicraft census revealed (according to data showing the time of origin of 8,884 small artisan and handicraft establishments) that the post-Reform period is characterised by a particularly rapid growth ofsmall industries. 
 It will be interesting to take a closer glanceat this process of the rise of new industries. 
 The productionof woollen and semi-silk fabrics in Vladimir Guberniabegan recently, in 1861. 
 At first this was a peasant outside occupation, but later “subcontractors” made their appear-ance in the villages, who distributed yarn. 
 One of the first“factory owners” at one time traded in groats, buying themup in the Tambov and Saratov “steppes. 
” With the buildingof railways, grain prices were levelled out, the grain tradebecame concentrated in the hands of millionaires, and so our merchant decided to invest his capital in an industrial weaving enterprise; he went to work in a factory, learntthe business and became a “subcontractor. 
” * Thus, the forma-tion of a new “industry” in this locality was due to the factthat the general economic development of the country wasforcing capital out of trade and directing it towards indus-try. 
 ** The investigator of the industry we have taken as an example points out that the case he has described isby no means an isolated one: the peasants who earnedtheir living by outside employments “were pioneers in allsorts of industries, carried their technical knowledgeto their native villages, got new labour forces to follow their example and migrate, and fired the imagination of the rich muzhiks with stories of the fabulous profits which the industrybrought the workroom owner and the subcontractor. 
 The richmuzhik, who used to store his money away in a chest, ortraded in grain, paid heed to these stories and put his moneyinto industrial undertakings” (ibid. 
). 
 The boot and felt industries in Alexandrov Uyezd, Vladimir Gubernia, arose in some places in the following way: the owners of calico in Industries of Moscow Gubernia and in Mr. 
 Isayev’s book of the same title. 
 *Industries of Vladimir Gubernia , III, 242-243. 
 **In his researches into the historical destiny of the Russian factory, M. 
 I. 
 T. 
-Baranovsky showed that merchant’s capital was anecessary historical condition for the formation of large-scale industry. 
See his The Factory , etc. 
, St. 
 Petersburg, 1898. 
 workrooms or of small yarn-distributing shops, seeing that handweaving was declining, opened workshops of another kind, sometimes hiring craftsmen so as to get to know the trade and to teach their children. 
 * To the extent that large-scale industry forces small capital out of the branch ofproduction, this capital flows into others and stimulatestheir development in the same direction. 
 The general conditions of the post-Reform period which called forth the development of small industries in the rural districts are very vividly described by investigators ofMoscow industries. 
 “On the one hand, the conditions ofpeasant life have greatly deteriorated during this period,”we read in a description of the lace industry, “but on theother, the requirements of the population, of that part which lives under more favourable conditions, have considerably increased. 
 ** And the author, using the data of the region he has taken, notes an increase in the numberof those owning no horses and raising no crops, side by sidewith an increase in the number of peasants owning manyhorses and in the total number of cattle belonging to peasants. 
 Thus, on the one hand, there was an increase in the number of persons in need of “outside earnings” and in search ofindustrial work, while on the other, a minority ofprosperous families grew rich, accumulated “savings,” andwere “able to hire a worker or two, or give out work to poorpeasants to be done at home. 
” “Of course,” the author explains, “we are not dealing here with cases where individuals who are known as kulaks, or blood-suckers, develop fromamong such families; we are merely examining mostordinary phenomena among the peasant population. 
” So then, local investigators point to a connection between the differentiation of the peasantry and the growth of small peasant industries. 
 And that is quite natural. 
 From the data given in Chapter II it follows that the differentiation of theagricultural peasantry had necessarily to be supplementedby a growth of small peasant industries. 
 As natural economydeclined, one form of raw-material processing after anotherturned into separate branches of industry; the formation of *Industries of Vladimir Gubernia , II, 25, 270. 
 **Industries of Moscow Gubernia , Vol. 
 II, Pt. 
 II, p. 
 8 and foll. 
 a peasant bourgeoisie and of a rural proletariat increased the demand for the products of the small peasant industries, while at the same time supplying free hands for these indus-tries and free money. 
 * IV. 
 THE DIFFERENTIATION OF THE SMALL COMMODITY-PRODUCERS. 
 DATA ON HOUSE-TO-HOUSE CENSUSES OF HANDICRAFTSMEN IN MOSCOW GUBERNIA Let us now examine the social and economic relations that develop among the small commodity-producers inindustry. 
 The task of defining the character of these relationsis similar to the one outlined above, in Chapter II, in rela-tion to the small farmers. 
 Instead of the scale of farming, we must now take as our basis the size of the industrial establishments; we must classify the small industrialistsaccording to the size of their output, ascertain the partwage-labour plays in each group, the conditions of technique,etc. 
 ** The handicraft house-to-house censuses that we need for such an analysis are available for Moscow Gubernia. 
 *** For *The fundamental theoretical error made by Mr. 
 N. 
 —on in his arguments about the “capitalisation of industries” is that heignores the initial steps of commodity production and capitalism inits consecutive stages. 
 Mr. 
 N. 
 —on leaps right over from “people’s production” to “capitalism,” and then is surprised, with amusingnaïvety, to find that he has got a capitalism that is without basisthat is artificial, etc. 
 **Describing “handicraft” industry in Chernigov Gubernia, Mr. 
 Varzer notes “the variety of economic units” (on the one hand,families with incomes from 500 to 800 rubles, and on the other,“almost paupers”) and makes the following observation: “Under suchcircumstances, the only way to present a full picture of the economiclife of the craftsmen is to make a house-to-house inventory and toclassify their establishments in a number of average types with alltheir accessories. 
 Anything else will be either a fantasy of casualimpressions or arm-chair exercises in arithmetical calculations basedon a diversity of average norms ...” ( Transactions of the Handicraft Commission , Vol. 
 V, p. 
 354).

 VI and VII. 
 Industries of Moscow Gubernia, and A. 
 Isayev’s Industries of Moscow Gubernia , Moscow, 1876-1877, 2 vols. 
 For a small number of industries similar information is given in Industries of Vladimir Gubernia . 
 It goes without saying that in the present chapter we confine ourselvesto an examination of only those industries in which the small a number of industries the investigators quote precise sta-tistics on output, and sometimes also on the farms of each separate craftsman (date of origin of establishment, number of workers, family and hired, total annual output, numberof horses owned by craftsmen, method of cultivating thesoil, etc. 
). 
 The investigators provide no classified tables,however, and we have therefore been obliged to compilethem ourselves, dividing the craftsmen in each industry into grades (I, bottom; II, middle and III, top) according to the number of workers (family and hired) per establish-ment, and sometimes according to the volume of output,technical organisation, etc. 
 In general, the criteria accord-ing to which the craftsmen have been divided into gradesare based on all the data given in the description of the industry; but in different industries we have found it neces-sary to take different criteria for dividing the craftsmeninto grades. 
 For example, in very small industries we haveplaced in the bottom grade establishments with 1 worker,in the middle grade those with 2, and in the top grade thosewith 3 and more; whereas in the bigger industries we have placed in the bottom grade establishments with 1 to 5 work-ers, in the middle grade those with 6 to 10, etc. 
 Had we notemployed different methods of classification we could nothave presented for each industry data concerning establish-ments of different size. 
 The table drawn up on these linesis given in the Appendix (see Appendix I); it shows the criteria according to which the craftsmen in each industry are divided up into grades, gives for each grade in eachindustry absolute figures of the number of establishments,workers (family and hired combined), aggregate output,establishments employing wage-workers, number of wage-workers. 
 To describe the farms of the handicraftsmen we have calculated the average number of horses per peasant household in each grade and the percentage of craftsmenwho cultivate their land with the aid of “a labourer” (i. 
e. 
, commodity-producers work for the market and not for buyers-up,—at all events, in the overwhelming majority of cases. 
 Work for buyers-upis a more complicated phenomenon, one that we shall examine sepa-rately later on. 
 The house-to-house censuses of handicraftsmen who work for buyers-up are unsuitable for judging the relations existing among small commodity-producers. 
 resort to the hire of rural workers). 
 The table covers a total of 37 industries, with 2,278 establishments and 11,833 employed and an aggregate output valued at over 5 million rubles; but if we subtract the 4 industries not included in thegeneral list because of incompleteness of data, or becauseof their exceptional character, * there is a total of 33 indus-tries, 2,085 establishments, 9,427 workers and an aggregateoutput of 3,466,000 rubles, or, with corrections (in the case of 2 industries), about 3 w million rubles. 
 Since there is no need to examine the data for all the 33 industries, and as it would be too arduous a task, we havedivided these industries into four categories: 1) 9 indus-tries with an average of 1. 
6 to 2. 
5 workers (family and hiredcombined) per establishment; 2) 9 industries with an average of 2. 
7 to 4. 
4 workers; 3) 10 industries with an average of 5. 
1 to 8. 
4 workers; and 4) 5 industries with an average of11. 
5 to 17. 
8 workers. 
 Thus, in each category we have com-bined industries that are fairly similar as regards the numberof workers per establishment, and in our further expositionwe shall limit ourselves to the data for these four categories of industries. 
 We give these data in extenso. 
 (See Table on p. 
 347. 
) This table combines those principal data on the rela-tions between the top and bottom grades of handicrafts-men that will serve us for our subsequent conclusions. 
We can illustrate the summarised data for all four catego-ries with a chart drawn up in exactly the same way as the one with which, in Chapter II, we illustrated the differen-tiation of the agricultural peasantry. 
 We ascertain whatpercentage each grade constitutes of the total number ofestablishments, of the total number of family workers, ofthe total number of establishments with wage-workers, of the total number of workers (family and wage combined), of the aggregate output and of the total number of wage-workers, and we indicate these percentages (in the mannerdescribed in Chapter II) on the chart (see chart on p. 
 349). 
 *On these grounds the pottery “industry,” in which 20 establish-ments employ 1,817 wage-workers, has been excluded. 
 It is charac-teristic of the confusion of terms prevailing among us that the Moscowstatisticians included this industry, too, among the “handicraft”industries (see combined tables in Part III of Vol.

 Absolute figures * of a) establishmentsb) workers c) aggregate output (rubles) Total Total Total Total Categories ofindustries{ { { { { Let us now examine the conclusions to be drawn from these data. 
 We begin with the role of wage-labour. 
 In the 33 indus-tries wage-labour predominates over family labour: 51% of the workers are hired; for the “handicraftsmen” of Mos-cow Gubernia this percentage is even lower than the actualone. 
 We have computed the data for 54 industries of Mos-cow Gubernia for which exact figures as to wage-workers employed are available, and got the figure of 17,566 wage-workers out of a total of 29,446 workers, i. 
e. 
, 59. 
65%. 
 For Perm Gubernia the percentage of wage-workers among all handicraftsmen and artisans combined was established as24. 
5%, and among commodity-producers alone, as from 29. 
4 to 31. 
2%. 
 But these gross figures, as we shall see below, embrace not only small commodity-producers, but alsocapitalist manufacture. 
 Far more interesting, therefore, is the conclusion that the role of wage-labour rises parallel to the increase in the size of establishments : this is observed both in comparing one category with another and in comparing the different grades in the same category. 
 The larger the establishments, the higher the percentage ofthose employing wage-workers and the higher the percent-age of wage-workers. 
 The Narodnik economists usually limit themselves to declaring that among the “handicraftsmen”small establishments with exclusively family workers pre-vail, and in support of this often cite “average” figures. 
 As is evident from the data given, these “averages” are unsuit-able for characterising the phenomenon in this regard, and the numerical preponderance of small establishments with family workers does not in the least eliminate the basicfact that the tendency of small commodity production is towards the ever-growing employment of wage-labour , towards the formation of capitalist workshops . 
 Moreover, the data cited also refute another, no less widespread, Narodnik assertion, namely, that wage-labour in “handicraft” production really serves to “supplement” family labour, thatit is resorted to not for the purpose of profit-making, etc.

 In the majority of indus-tries we see that the employment of wage-labour increases aswe pass from the bottom grade to the top, notwithstanding the fact that the number of family workers per establish-ment also increases. 
 The employment of wage-labour doesnot smooth out differences in the size of the “handicrafts-men’s” families, but accentuates them. 
 The chart very clearly shows this common feature of the small industries:the top grade employs the bulk of the wage-workers,despite the fact that it is best provided with family workers. 
“Family co-operation ” is thus the basis of capitalist co-opera-tion . 
 * It goes without saying, of course, that this “law” applies only to the smallest commodity-producers, only to the rudiments of capitalism; this law proves that the tend-ency of the peasantry is to turn into petty bourgeois. 
 Assoon as workshops with a fairly large number of wage-workers arise, the significance of “family co-operation” mustinevitably decline. 
 And we see, indeed, from our data that this law does not apply to the biggest grades of the top cat-egories. 
 When the “handicraftsman” turns into a real capi-talist employing from 15 to 30 wage-workers, the part playedby family labour in his workshops declines and becomesquite insignificant (for example, in the top grade of the topcategory, family workers constitute only 7% of the total number of workers). 
 In other words, to the extent that the “handicraft” industries are so small that “family co-operation” predominates in them, this family co-operation isthe surest guarantee of the development of capitalistco-operation. 
 Here, consequently, stand out in full relief thedialectics of commodity production, which transform “work-ing with our own hands” into working with others’ hands, into exploitation. 
 Let us pass to the data on productivity of labour. 
 The data on total output per worker in each grade show thatwith the increase in the size of the establishment labour prod-uctivity improves . 
 This is to be observed in the overwhelm-*The same conclusion follows from the data regarding the Perm “handicraftsmen”, see our Studies , pp. 
 126-128. 
 (See present edition, Vol. 
 2, The Handicraft Census of 1894-95 in Perm Gubernia .

) ing majority of the industries, and in all categories of industries without exception; the chart graphically illus-trates this law, showing that the share of the top grade in total output is greater than is its share in the total numberof workers; in the bottom grade the reverse is the case. 
 Thetotal output per worker in the establishments of the topgrades is from 20 to 40 per cent higher than that in the bottomgrade establishments. 
 It is true that the big establishments usually have a longer working period and sometimes handle more valuable material than do the small ones, but thesetwo circumstances cannot eliminate the fact that labourproductivity is considerably higher in the big workshopsthan in the small ones. 
 * Nor can it be otherwise. 
 The big establishments have from 3 to 5 times as many workers (fam-ily and hired combined) as the small ones, and co-operation on a larger scale cannot but increase the productivityof labour. 
 The big workshops are always better equippedtechnically, they have better implements, tools, accesso-ries, machines, etc. 
 For example, in the brush industry, a“properly organised workshop” must have as many as 15 workers, and in hook-making 9 to 10 workers. 
 In the toy industry the majority of handicraftsmen make shift withordinary stoves for drying their goods; the bigger toy-makershave special drying ovens, and the biggest makers havespecial drying premises. 
 In metal toy-making, 8 makers outof 16 have special workshops, divided as follows: I) 6 have none; II) 5 have 3; and III) 5 have 5. 
 A total of 142 mirror and picture-frame makers have 18 special workshops, thefigures by grades being: I) 99 have 3; II) 27 have 4; andIII) 16 have 11. 
 In the screen-plaiting industry screens areplaited by hand (in grade I), and woven mechanically (ingrades II and III). 
 In the tailoring industry the number of sewing-machines per owner according to grade is as follows: I) 1. 
3; II) 2. 
1; and III) 3. 
4, etc. 
, etc. 
 In investigating thefurniture industry, Mr. 
 Isayev notes that the one-manbusiness suffers the following disadvantages: 1) lack of a *For the starch-making industry, which is included in our tables, data are available on the duration of the working period inestablishments of various sizes. 
 It appears (as we have seen above)that even in an equal period the output per worker in a big establish-ment is higher than that in a small one. 
 complete set of tools; 2) limited assortment of articles made, because there is no room in the craftsman’s hut for bulky articles; 3) much higher cost of materials when bought retail (30 to 35% higher); 4) necessity of selling wares cheaper,partly due to lack of confidence in the small “handicrafts-man” and partly to his need of money. 
 * It is well known that exactly the same sort of thing is to be observed not onlyin the furniture industry, but also in the vast majority of small peasant industries. 
 Lastly, it must be added that the value of the goods produced per worker not onlyincreases from the bottom to the top grade in the majority ofindustries, but also from the small to the big industries. 
 Inthe first category of industries the average output per workeris 202 rubles, in the second and third about 400 rubles, and in the fourth over 500 rubles (the figure 381 should, for the reason stated above, be increased by about fiftyper cent). 
 This circumstance points to the connectionbetween the rise in the price of raw materials and the oustingof the small establishments by the big ones. 
 Every step inthe development of capitalist society is inevitably accom-panied by a rise in the price of such materials as timber, etc. 
, and thus hastens the doom of the small establishments. 
 From the foregoing it follows that the relatively big capitalist establishments also play a tremendous part inthe small peasant industries. 
 While constituting a smallminority of the total number of establishments, they con-centrate, however, quite a big share of the total number of workers, and a still bigger share of the total output. 
Thus, in 33 industries of Moscow Gubernia, the top-gradeestablishments, constituting 15% of the total, account for45% of the aggregate output; while the bottom-grade estab-lishments, constituting 53% of the total, account for only 21% of the aggregate output. 
 It goes without saying that the distribution of the net income from the industries mustbe far more uneven. 
 The data of the Perm handicraft censusof 1894-95 clearly illustrate this. 
 Selecting the largest *The small producer tries to make up for these unfavourable conditions by working longer hours and with greater intensity (loc. 
cit. 
, p 38).

 The small proprietors obtain a net income considerably below thewages of the hired workers employed in the big estab-lishments; elsewhere we have shown in detail that thisphenomenon is no exception but is a general rule for smallpeasant industries. 
 ** *See our Studies , p. 
 153 and foll. 
 (see present edition, Vol. 
 2, The Handicraft Census of 1894-95 in Perm Gubernia . 
—Ed. 
) where data are given for each industry separately. 
 Let us note that all these datarefer to handicraftsmen cultivators who work for the market. 
 **From the data given in the text it can be seen that in the small peasant industries a tremendous, and even predominant, part isplayed by establishments with an output exceeding 1,000 rubles. 
 Let us recall that in our official statistics establishments of this kind have always been, and still are, classed among “factories and works”[cf. 
 Studies , pp. 
 267 and 270 (see present edition, Vol. 
 4, “On the Question of Our Factory Statistics. 
”— Ed. 
) and Chapter VII, §II]. 
 Thus, if we thought it permissible for an economist to use the current,traditional terminology beyond which our Narodniks have never gone, we would be entitled to establish the following “law”: among peasant, “handicraft” establishments a predominant part is played by “factoriesand works,” not included in official statistics because of theirunsatisfactory nature. 
Number of estab-lishments family hiredtotaltotal perworker total per wage-worker total per fami-ly worker Summing up the conclusions that follow from the data we have analysed, we must say that the economic system of the small peasant industries is typically petty bourgeois, the same as that which we have seen among the smallfarmers. 
 The expansion, development and improvement ofthe small peasant industries cannot take place in the pres-ent social and economic atmosphere except by generatinga minority of small capitalists on the one hand, and a majority of wage-workers, or of “independent craftsmen” who lead a harder and worse life than the wage-workers, onthe other. 
 We observe, consequently, in the smallest peas-ant industries the most pronounced rudiments of capital-ism—of that very capitalism which various economistsof the Manilov 121 type depict as something divorced from “people’s production. 
” From the viewpoint of the home mar-ket theory the facts we have examined are also of no littleimportance. 
 The development of small peasant industriesleads to an expansion of the demand by the more prosperousindustrialists for means of production and for labour-power,which is drawn from the ranks of the rural proletariat. 
 The number of wage-workers employed by village artisans and small industrialists all over Russia should be quiteimpressive, if in the Perm Gubernia alone, for example,there are about 6,500. 
 * *Let us add that in other gubernias, besides Moscow and Perm, the sources note quite analogous relations among the small commodity-producers. 
 See, for instance, Industries of Vladimir Gubernia , Vol. 
 II, house-to-house censuses of shoemakers and fullers; Transactions of the Handicraft Commission , Vol II—on the wheelwrights of Medyn Uyezd; Vol. 
 II—on the sheepskin dressers of the same uyezd; Vol.

 All these sources differ from the house-to-house census datawe have examined only in their incompleteness and poverty. 
 Theessence of the matter, however, is identical everywhere. 
 V. 
 CAPITALIST SIMPLE CO-OPERATION The establishment by small commodity-producers of rel-atively large workshops marks the transition to a higherform of industry. 
 Out of scattered small production risescapitalist simple co-operation . 
 “Capitalist production only then really begins . 
 . 
 . 
 when each individual capital employssimultaneously a comparatively large number of labourers; when consequently the labour-process is carried on on an extensive scale and yields, relatively, large quantities ofproducts. 
 A greater number of labourers working together,at the same time, in one place (or, if you will, in the samefield of labour), in order to produce the same sort of commod-ity under the mastership of one capitalist, constitutes, both historically and logically, the starting-point of capi-talist production. 
 With regard to the mode of productionitself, manufacture, in its strict meaning, is hardly to bedistinguished, in its earliest stages, from the artisantrades of the guilds, otherwise than by the greater numberof workmen simultaneously employed by one and the same individual capital. 
 The workshop of the medieval master handicraftsman is simply enlarged” ( Das Kapital , I 2, S. 
 329). 
122 It is this starting-point of capitalism that is to be seen, consequently, in our small peasant (“handicraft”) indus-tries. 
 The different historical situation (absence or slight development of guild handicrafts) merely changes the way in which identical capitalist relations are made manifest. 
The difference between the capitalist workshop and the work-shop of the small industrialist lies at first only in thenumber of workers simultaneously employed. 
 That is why thefirst capitalist establishments, being numerically in the minority, are submerged, as it were, in the general mass of small establishments. 
 However, the employment of alarger number of workers inevitably leads to consecutivechanges in production itself, to the gradual transformationof production. 
 Under primitive hand technique differencesbetween the individual workers (in strength, dexterity, skill, etc. 
) are always very considerable; if only for this reason the position of the small industrialist is extremelyprecarious; his dependence upon market fluctuations assumes the most burdensome forms. 
 Where, however, several workers are employed in an establishment, the individual differences between them are smoothed out in the workshop itself: “the collective working day of a large number ofworkmen simultaneously employed . 
 . 
 . 
 gives one day ofaverage social labour,” 123 and as a consequence, the manu-facture and sale of the products of the capitalist workshopacquire incomparably greater regularity and stability. 
 It becomes possible to make fuller use of premises, warehouses, implements, instruments of labour, etc. 
; and this leadsto a cheapening of production costs in the larger workshops. 
 * The organisation of production on a larger scale and thesimultaneous employment of many workers require the accu-mulation of a fairly large capital, which is often formed, not in the sphere of production, but in the sphere of trade, etc. 
 The size of this capital determines the form in which theproprietor himself takes part in the enterprise—whetherhe himself is a worker, if his capital is still very small,or whether he gives up working himself and specialises incommercial and entrepreneur functions. 
 “One can establish a connection between the position of the workshop owner and the number of his workers”—we read, for example, in adescription of the furniture industry. 
 “The employment of2 or 3 workers provides the proprietor with such a smallsurplus that he has to work alongside of them. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 Theemployment of 5 workers already gives the proprietor enough to enable him to give up manual labour in some measure, to *For example, concerning the metal-beaters124 of Vladimir Gubernia, we read: “With the employment of a larger number of workers a considerable reduction in expenditure may be effected; this concerns expenditure on light, blocks, anvil-stone and casing”(Industries of Vladimir Gubernia , III, 188). 
 In the copper-beating industry of Perm Gubernia a one-man establishment needs a com-plete set of tools (16 items); for two workers “a very small addition”is required. 
 “For workshops employing 6 or 8 persons three or four sets of tools are required.... 
 Only one lathe is kept even in a workshop employing 8 men” ( Transactions of the Handicraft Commission , X, 2939). 
 The fixed capital of a big workshop is estimated at 466 rubles,of a medium workshop at 294 rubles, and of a small one at 80 rubles;and the total output at 6,200 rubles, 3,655 rubles, and 871 rublesrespectively. 
 That is to say, in the small workshops the output is 11 times the amount of the fixed capital, in the medium ones 12 times, and in the big ones 14 times. 
 take it easy somewhat, and to engage mainly in the last two business functions” (i. 
e. 
, purchase of materials and sale of goods). 
 “As soon as the number of wage-workers reaches 10 or exceeds this figure, the proprietor not only gives upmanual labour but practically ceases to supervise his work-ers: he appoints a foreman for the purpose. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 He nowbecomes a small capitalist, a ‘born master’” (Isayev, Indus-tries of Moscow Gubernia , I, 52-53). 
 The statistics we have cited graphically confirm this description, showing a decline in the number of family workers with the appearanceof a considerable number of wage-workers. 
 The general significance of capitalist simple co-operation in the development of capitalist forms of industry is de-scribed by the author of Capital as follows: “Historically, however, this form is developed in oppo-sition to peasant agriculture and to the carrying on ofindependent handicrafts whether in guilds or not. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 Justas the social productive power of labour that is developedby co-operation, appears to be the productive power ofcapital, so co-operation itself, contrasted with the process of production carried on by isolated independent labourers, or even by small employers, appears to be a specific form ofthe capitalist process of production. 
 It is the first changeexperienced by the actual labour-process, when subjectedto capital. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 The simultaneous employment of a large num-ber of wage-labourers, in one and the same process, which is a necessary condition of this change, also forms the starting-point of capitalist production. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 If then, on theone hand, the capitalist mode of production presents itself tous historically, as a necessary condition to the transforma-tion of the labour-process into a social process, so, on theother hand, this social form of the labour-process presents itself, as a method employed by capital for the more profi-table exploitation of labour, by increasing that labour’sproductiveness. 
 “In the elementary form, under which we have hitherto viewed it, co-operation is a necessary concomitant of allproduction on a large scale, but it does not, in itself, repre-sent a fixed form characteristic of a particular epoch in the development of the capitalist mode of production. 
 At themost it appears to do so, and that only approximately, in the handicraft-like beginnings of manufacture . 
 . 
 . 
” (Das Kapital , I2, 344-345). 
125 We shall see later how closely small “handicraft” estab-lishments in Russia which employ wage-workers areconnected with incomparably more highly developed andmore widespread forms of capitalism. 
 As for the role of theseestablishments in the small peasant industries, the statis-tics already given show that these establishments create fairly wide capitalist co-operation in place of the previous scattered production and considerably raise the produc-tivity of labour. 
 Our conclusion as to the tremendous role of capitalist co-operation in the small peasant industries and as to its pro-gressive significance is in sharp contrast to the widespread Narodnik doctrine of the predominance of all sorts of mani-festations of the “artel principle” in the small peasantindustries. 
 As a matter of fact, the reverse is the case; thedistinguishing feature of small industry (and handicrafts) isthe extremely scattered nature of the individual producers. 
In support of the contrary view Narodnik literature could advance nothing more than a collection of individual examples, the overwhelming majority of which do not applyto co-operation at all, but to temporary, miniature associa-tions of masters, big and small, for the common purchaseof raw materials, for the building of a common workshop,etc. 
 Such artels do not in the least affect the predominant significance of capitalist co-operation. 
 * To obtain an exact idea of how widely the “artel principle” is actually appliedit is not enough to cite examples taken at random here and *We do not think it worth our while to support the statement made in the text with examples, a host of which may be found inMr. 
 V. 
 V. 
’s The Artel in Handicraft Industry (St. 
 Petersburg, 1895). 
 Mr. 
 Volgin has dealt with the true significance of the examples cited by Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
 (op. 
 cit. 
, p. 
 182 and foll. 
) and has shown the very negli-gible part played by the “artel principle” in our “handicraft” industry. 
Let us merely note the following assertion by Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
: “...the amal-gamation of several independent handicraftsmen into one productionunit ... is not imperatively dictated by competition, as is proved by the absence in the majority of industries of workshops of any size employing wage-workers” (93). 
 To advance such a bald and sweepingthesis is, of course, much easier than to analyse the house-to-housecensus data available on this question. 
 /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR there; it is necessary to take the data for some area which has been thoroughly investigated, and to examine the relative incidence and significance of the various forms of co-operation. 
 Such, for example, are the data of the Perm“handicrafts” census of 1894-95; and we have shownelsewhere ( Studies , pp. 
 182-187 *) what an amazing dis-persion of small industrialists was revealed by the census,and what importance attaches to the very few big estab-lishments. 
 The conclusion we have drawn as to the role of capitalist co-operation is based not on isolated examples,but on the precise data of the house-to-house censuses, whichembrace scores of the most diverse industries in differentlocalities. 
 VI. 
 MERCHANT’S CAPITAL IN THE SMALL INDUSTRIES As we know, the small peasant industries in many cases give rise to special buyers-up, who are particularly engagedin the commercial operations of marketing products and purchasing raw materials, and who usually in one way or another subject the small tradesmen to themselves. 
 Let us seewhat connection this phenomenon has with the general sys-tem of small peasant industries and what its significance is. 
 The principal economic operation of the buyer-up is to buy goods (finished products or raw materials) in order to resell them. 
 In other words, the buyer-up is a representa-tive of merchant’s capital. 
 The starting-point of all capital—both industrial and merchant’s—is the accumulation offree money in the hands of individuals (by free money wemean that money which is not needed for personal consump-tion, etc. 
). 
 How this property differentiation takes place in our rural districts has been shown in detail above by the data on the differentiation of the agricultural and theindustrial peasantry. 
 These data revealed one of the conditions giving rise to the appearance of the buyer-up, namely: the scattered nature, the isolation of the small producers, theexistence of economic conflict and strife among them. 
 *See present edition, Vol. 
 2, The Handicraft Census of 1894-95 in Perm Gubernia . 
—Ed. 
 Another condition relates to the character of the functions performed by merchant’s capital, i. 
e. 
, to the marketing of wares and to the purchase of raw materials. 
 Where the devel-opment of commodity production is slight, the small producerlimits himself to disposing of his wares in the small localmarket, sometimes even to disposing of them directly to theconsumer. 
 This is the lowest stage of the development ofcommodity production, hardly to be distinguished from artisan production. 
 As the market expands, this petty, scat-tered marketing (which fully conforms to petty, scatteredproduction) becomes impossible . 
 In the big market, selling must he on a big, on a mass scale. 
 And so the petty characterof production proves to be in irreconcilable contradictionwith the need for big, wholesale marketing. 
 Under the existing social and economic conditions, with the isolation of the small producers and their differentiation, this con-tradiction could only be resolved by the well-to-do minoritytaking charge of marketing, concentrating it in their hands. 
By buying-up goods (or raw materials) on a large scale, thebuyers-up thus cheapened marketing costs and transformed marketing from a petty, casual and irregular operation into a large and regular one; and this purely economic advantageof large-scale marketing inevitably led to the small pro-ducer finding himself cut off from the market and defencelessin face of the power of merchant’s capital. 
 Thus, under com-modity economy, the small producer inevitably falls into dependence upon merchant’s capital by virtue of the purely economic superiority of large, mass-scale marketing overscattered, petty marketing. 
 * It goes without saying that actually the profits of the buyers-up are often far fromlimited to the difference between the returns of mass sales *Regarding the significance of trading, merchant’s capital in the development of capitalism in general we would refer the reader toCapital , Vol. 
 III. 
 See especially III, I, S. 
 253-254 (Russ. 
 trans. 
, 212), on the essence of commodity-trading capital; S. 
 259 (Russ. 
 trans.

, 260-261), on the historical role of merchant’s capital as necessary “premises for the development of capitalist production. 
” 126 and those of petty sales, just as the profits of the industrial capitalists often consist of deductions from normal wages. 
 Nevertheless, to explain the profits of the industrial capi-talists we must assume that labour-power is sold at its realvalue. 
 Similarly, to explain the role of the buyer-up we mustassume that he buys and sells goods in accordance with thegeneral laws of commodity exchange. 
 Only these economiccauses of the domination of merchant’s capital can provide the key to an understanding of the variety of forms which it assumes in real life, and among which we constantly meet(there can be no doubt of that) the plainest fraud. 
 To pro-ceed otherwise, as the Narodniks usually do, that is, to con-fine oneself to enumerating the various tricks of the “kulaks,”and on these grounds completely to brush aside the economic nature of the phenomenon would be to adopt the viewpoint of vulgar economics. 
 * To substantiate our thesis concerning a necessary causal relation between small production for the market and thedomination of merchant’s capital, lot us deal in greater detailwith one of the best descriptions of how the buyer-up appears and of the part he plays. 
 We have in mind the investigation of the lace industry in Moscow Gubernia ( Industries of Mos-cow Gubernia , Vol. 
 VI, Pt. 
 II). 
 The “tradeswomen” came into being in the following way. 
 In the 1820s, when thisindustry first developed, and later, when the number oflace-makers was still small, the principal buyers were the landlords, the “gentry”. 
 The consumer was in the neighbour-hood of the producer. 
 As the industry spread, the peasantsbegan to send their lace to Moscow “as chance offered,”for example, through comb-makers. 
 The inconvenience of *The preconceived viewpoint of the Narodniks, who have ideal-ised the “handicraft” industries and pictured merchant’s capitalas a sort of deplorable deviation and not as a necessary accessory tosmall production for the market is unfortunately reflected in statis-tical investigations. 
 Thus, we have a number of house-to-house cen-suses of handicraftsmen (for Moscow, Vladimir and Perm gubernias) which carefully investigated the business of each small industrialist,but ignored the business of the buyers-up, did not investigate how his capital is built up and what determines its magnitude, what arethe sales’ receipts and purchase costs of the buyer-up etc. 
 Cf. 
 our Studies , p. 
 169 (See present edition, Vol. 
 2, The Handicraft Census of 1894-95 in Perm Gubernia . 
—Ed. 
). 
 this primitive form of marketing very soon made itself felt: “how can a muzhik not engaged in this business go from house to house?” The sale of the lace was entrusted to one of the lace-makers, who was compensated for the time she lost. 
“She also brought back thread for the lace. 
” Thus the incon-veniences of isolated marketing led to turning trade into aspecial function performed by one person who gathered thewares from many lace-makers. 
 The patriarchal proximity of these women workers one to the other (relatives, neigh-bours, fellow-villagers, etc. 
) at first gave rise to attempts atthe co-operative organisation of sales, to attempts at entrust-ing this function to one of the women workers. 
 But moneyeconomy at once causes a breach in the age-old patriarchalrelations, at once gives rise to the phenomena we noted above when examining the mass-scale data on the differentiation of the peasantry. 
 Production for sale teaches that time ismoney. 
 It becomes necessary to compensate the intermedi-ary for her lost time and labour; she becomes accustomed tothis occupation and begins to make it her profession. 
 “Journ-eys of this kind, repeated several times, gave rise to the tradeswoman type” (loc. 
 cit. 
, 30). 
 The woman who has been to Moscow several times establishes the permanent connec-tions which are so necessary for proper marketing. 
 “Thusthe need and habit of living on earnings from commissionoperations develops. 
” In addition to commission earnings,the tradeswoman “does what she can to advance the price of materials, paper, thread”; she sells the lace above the set price and pockets the difference; the tradeswomen declarethat the price received was less than the one agreed on:“take it or leave it,” they say. 
 “The tradeswomen begin . 
 . 
 . 
 tobring goods from the towns and make a considerable profit. 
”The commission agent thus becomes an independent trader who now begins to monopolise sales and to take advantage of her monopoly to subjugate the lace-makers completely. 
Usurious operations appear alongside commercial operations—the lending of money to the lace-makers, the takingof goods from them at reduced prices, etc. 
 “The girls . 
 . 
 . 
pay 10 kopeks per ruble as a commission for sales. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 They know very well that the tradeswoman makes even more out of them by selling the lace at a higher price. 
 But theysimply do not know how to arrange things differently. 
 When I suggested that they should take turns in going to Moscow, they replied that this would be worse, because they did not know where to sell the lace, whereas the tradeswoman already knew all the places. 
 She sells the finished lacefor them and brings back orders, materials, patterns, etc. 
;she always gives them money in advance, or on loan, andone can even sell her a piece of lace outright, should the needarise. 
 Thus, on the one hand, the tradeswoman becomes a most needed, indispensable person; on the other, she gradu-ally develops into a person who cruelly exploits the labourof others—a woman kulak” (32). 
 To this it should be addedthat such types develop from among the small producersthemselves: “However many enquiries we made, we foundthat all the tradeswomen had formerly been lace-makers them-selves, and consequently, were familiar with the trade; they came from the ranks of these same lace-makers; they had hadno capital to start with, and had only gradually begun totrade in calico and other goods, as they made money out oftheir commissions” (31). 
 * There can, therefore, be no doubt that under commodity economy, not only prosperous industrialists in general, but also, and particularly, representatives of merchant’s capital emerge from among the small produc-ers. 
 ** And once they have emerged, the elimination of small, scattered marketing by large-scale, wholesale market-ing becomes inevitable. 
 *** Here are a few examples of how marketing is organised by the bigger “handicraft” proprietors who are at the same time buyers-up. 
 The marketing of abacuses by craftsmen of Moscow Gubernia (see the statistics *The emergence of buyers-up from among the small producers themselves is a common thing noted by investigators almost every-where as soon as they touch upon this question. 
 See, for example, the same remark about “distributors” in the kid-glove industry ( In-dustries of Moscow Gubernia , Vol. 
 VII, Pt. 
 II, pp. 
 175-176), about the buyers-up in the Pavlovo industry (Grigoryev, loc. 
 cit. 
, 92),and many others. 
 **Korsak ( Forms of Industry ) in his day quite rightly noted the connection between the unprofitableness of small-scale marketing (and of small-scale buying of raw materials) and the “general character ofsmall, scattered production” (pp. 
 23 and 239). 
 *** Very often the big handicraft proprietors whom we discussed in detail above are also in some measure buyers-up. 
 For instance,the purchase of the wares of small industrialists by big ones is a very widespread practice. 
 relating to them in our table; Appendix I) is done mainly at fairs all over Russia. 
 To do business oneself at a fair one must have, firstly, a considerable amount of capital, as only wholesale trade is conducted at the fairs; and, secondly,one must have an agent to buy up wares where they are made,and to send them on to the merchant. 
 These requirementsare met “by the one merchant-peasant,” who is also a “crafts-man,” possesses a considerable amount of capital and engages in finishing the abacuses (i. 
e. 
, fitting the frames and beads) and marketing them; his six sons are “engagedexclusively in commerce,” so that two persons have to behired to cultivate the allotment. 
 “It is not surprising,”observes the investigator, “that he is able to sell his wares . 
 . 
 . 
at all the fairs, whereas the smaller traders usually sell theirs at nearby markets” ( Industries of Moscow Gubernia , VII, Pt. 
 I, Sec. 
 2, p. 
 141). 
 In this case the representative of merchant’scapital was still so little differentiated from the generalmass of “muzhik cultivators” that he even continued toretain his allotment farm and his large patriarchal family. 
The spectacle-frame makers of Moscow Gubernia are entirely dependent upon the industrialists to whom they sell their wares. 
 These buyers-up are at the same time “crafts-men” possessing their own workshops; they lend raw mate-rials to the poor on condition that the finished articles aredelivered to them, the “masters,” etc. 
 The small industrial-ists made an attempt to sell their wares in Moscow themselves, but failed; it did not pay to sell goods in small quanti-ties amounting to a matter of 10 or 15 rubles (ibid. 
, 263). 
 In the lace industry of Ryazan Gubernia the tradeswomen make profits amounting to 12 to 50% of the lace-makers’ earnings. 
 The “substantial” tradeswomen have established regular-connections with marketing centres and send goods by mail, which saves travelling expenses. 
 How necessary wholesale marketing is can be seen from the fact that the traders consider that even sales amounting to 150 and 200 rubles do not cover marketing expenses ( Transactions of the Handicraft Commission , VII, 1184). 
 The marketing of Belyov lace is organised as follows. 
 In the town of Belyov there are three grades of tradeswomen: 1) The distributor, who hands out small orders, makes the round of the lace-makers herself and delivers the finished article to the bigger tradeswomen. 
 2) The subcontractor, who places orders herself, or buys up goods from the distributors and delivers them to the big cities, etc. 
 3) The big tradeswomen (2 or 3 “firms”), who do business with commission agents, towhom they send lace and from whom they receive big orders. 
It is “practically impossible” for the provincial trades-women to sell their goods to the big shops: “the shops preferto do business with the wholesale buyers-up who deliver the wares in big quantities . 
 . 
 . 
 of the most diverse patterns”; the tradeswomen are obliged to sell to these “suppliers”;“it is from them that they learn all the requirements of themarket; it is they who fix prices; in short, but for them, thereis no way out” ( Transactions of the Handicraft Commis-sion , X, pp. 
 2823-2824). 
 Numerous such examples could be given. 
 But those given are quite sufficient to show how utterly impossible is small, scattered marketing whereproduction is for big markets. 
 In view of the scattered state of the small producers and of their complete differen-tiation * large-scale marketing can only be organised by large capital , which, by virtue of this, reduces the handi-craftsmen to a position of utter helplessness and dependence. 
 One can therefore judge how absurd are the current Narod-nik theories which recommend helping the “handicraftsmen”by “organising marketing. 
” From the purely theoreticalaspect such theories belong to the category of petty-bour-geois utopias, based on a failure to understand the indissol-uble connection between commodity production and capi-talist marketing. 
 ** As for the facts of Russian reality, the authors of such theories simply ignore them: they ignorethe scattered state of the small commodity-producers and *Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
 asserts that the handicraftsman who is under the sway of merchant’s capital “suffers losses that are fundamentallyquite superfluous” ( Essays on Handicraft Industry , 150). 
 Maybe Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
 imagines that the differentiation of the small producers is “fundamentally” a “quite superfluous” phenomenon, i. 
e. 
, fundamen-tally as regards the commodity economy under which the small pro-ducer lives? **“It is not a matter of the kulak, but of the shortage of capital among the handicraftsmen,” say the Perm Narodniks ( A Sketch of the Condition of Handicraft Industry in Perm Gubernia , p. 
 8). 
 But what is a kulak if not a handicraftsman with capital? The trouble is justthat the Narodniks refuse to investigate the process of differentiation of the small producers which yields entrepreneurs and “kulaks” from their utter differentiation; they ignore the fact that it is from their very midst that “buyers-up” have emerged and continue to emerge; that in capitalist society marketing can only be organised by big capital. 
 It is natural that if oneleaves out of account all these features of the unpleasant butundoubted reality, it is not difficult to conjure up phanta-sies * ins Blaue hinein. 
 ** We are unable here to go into descriptive details showing exactly how merchant’s capital manifests itself in our “handi-craft” industries, and how helpless and wretched is theposition in which it places the small industrialist. 
 More-over, in the next chapter we shall have to describe the domi-nance of merchant’s capital at a higher stage of development,where (as an adjunct of manufacture) it organises capital-ist domestic industry on a mass scale. 
 Here let us confine ourselves to indicating the main forms assumed by mer-*Among the quasi-economic arguments advanced in support of the Narodnik theories is the one about the small amount of “fixed”and “circulating” capital needed by the “independent handicraftsman. 
” The line of this extremely widespread argument is as follows: handi-craft industries greatly benefit the peasant and therefore should be implanted. 
 (We do not dwell on the amusing notion that the mass of the peasantry which is being steadily ruined can be helped byturning some of their number into small commodity-producers. 
) Andin order to implant these industries one must know how much “cap-ital” the handicraftsman needs to carry on his business. 
 Here is oneof numerous calculations of this sort. 
 The Pavlovo handicraftsman, says Mr. 
 Grigoryev for our edification, needs a fixed “capital” of 3 to 5 rubles, 10-13-15 rubles, etc. 
, counting cost of implements, and a cir-culating “capital” of 6 to 8 rubles, counting weekly expenditure on food and raw materials. 
 “Thus, the amount of the fixed and circulating capital (sic!) in Pavlovo District is so small that it is very easy to acquire the tools and materials needed for independent (sic!!) pro-duction” (loc. 
 cit. 
, 75). 
 And indeed, what could be “easier” than such an argument? With a stroke of the pen the Pavlovo proletarian is turned into a “capitalist”; all that was needed was to call his weeklykeep and miserably cheap tools “capital. 
” But the real capital of the big buyers-up who have monopolised sales, who alone are able to be “independent” de facto, and who handle capital running into thethousands this real capital the author simply passes over! Queer people, indeed, these well-to-do Pavlovians: for generations they have used, and continue to use, every foul means to pile up thousands ofrubles of capital, whereas according to the latest discoveries it seems that a “capital” of a few dozen rubles is sufficient to make one “inde-pendent”! chant’s capital in the small industries. 
 The first and simplest form is the purchase of wares by the merchant (or owner of a big workshop) from the small commodity producers. 
 Where buying-up is poorly developed, or where there arenumerous competing buyers-up, the sale of goods to the mer-chant may not differ from any other sale; but in the vastmajority of cases the local buyer-up is the only person towhom the peasant can regularly dispose of his wares, and then the buyer-up takes advantage of his monopoly position to force the price he pays to the producer down to rock bot-tom. 
 The second form of merchant’s capital consists in itscombination with usury: the peasant, who is constantly inneed of money, borrows it from the buyer-up and repays thedebt with his goods. 
 The sale of his goods in this case (which is very widespread) always takes place at artificially reduced prices, which often do not leave the handicraftsman asmuch as a wage-worker could get. 
 Moreover, the relationsof the creditor to the debtor inevitably lead to the personaldependence of the latter, to bondage, to the creditor takingadvantage of specific occasions of the debtor’s need, etc. 
 The third form of merchant’s capital is payment for wares with goods, a common practice among village buyers-up. 
 Thespecific feature of this form is that it is typical not onlyof the small industries but of absolutely all undevelopedstages of commodity production and capitalism. 
 Only large-scale machine industry, which has socialised labour and broken radically with all patriarchal usages, has eliminated this form of bondage by causing it to be legally prohibitedin large industrial establishments. 
 The fourth form of mer-chant’s capital is payment by the merchant with the partic-ular kinds of goods that are needed by the “handicraftsman”for production (raw or auxiliary materials, etc. 
). 
 The sale of materials of production to the small industrialist may also be an independent operation of merchant’s capital, quite analogous to the operation of buying-up finished goods. 
When, however, the buyer-up of finished goods begins topay for them with the raw materials needed by the “handi-craftsman,” this marks a very big step in the development of capitalist relations. 
 Having cut off the small indus-trialist from the finished-goods market, the buyer-up now cuts him off from the raw-materials market, and thereby brings him completely under his sway. 
 It is only one step from this form to that higher form of merchant’s capital under which the buyer-up directly hands out materials to the “handicraftsmen” to be worked up for a definite payment. 
The handicraftsman becomes de facto a wage-worker,working at home for the capitalist; the merchant’s capitalof the buyer-up is here transformed into industrial cap-ital. 
 * Capitalist domestic industry arises. 
 In the small industries it is met with more or less sporadically; its introduction on a mass scale, however, relates to the next andhigher stage of capitalist development. 
 VII. 
 “INDUSTRY AND AGRICULTURE” Such is the usual heading of special sections in descrip-tions of peasant industries. 
 In view of the fact that at the initial stage of capitalism which we are examining theindustrialist has hardly yet become differentiated from thepeasant, his connection with the land is something indeedhighly characteristic and requires special examination. 
 Let us begin with the data given in our table (see Appendix I). 
 To characterise the farms of the “handicraftsmen” there are given here, firstly, data on the average number ofhorses owned by the industrialists of each grade. 
 By combin-ing the 19 industries for which such data are available weget an all-round average per industrialist (master or petty-master) of 1. 
4 horses, and for the grades: I) 1. 
1; II) 1. 
5 and III) 2. 
0. 
 Thus the higher the proprietor’s position in respect to the size of his industrial establishment, the higher hisposition as an agriculturist. 
 The biggest industrialists havealmost twice as many draught animals as the small ones. 
But with regard to their farms even the smallest industrial-ists (grade I) are above the middle peasantry, for the gen-eral average for Moscow Gubernia in 1877 was 0. 
87 horses per peasant household. 
 ** Thus it is only the relatively *The pure form of merchant’s capital is the purchase of a com-modity in order to sell this same commodity at a profit. 
 The pure form of industrial capital is the purchase of a commodity in order to sell it in worked-up form , hence the purchase of raw materials, etc. 
, and the purchase of labour-power, which processes the material. 
 **See Combined Statistical Material on the Economic Position of the Rural Population , published by the Committee of Ministers, Appendix I: Data of Zemstvo house-to-house investigations, pp. 
 372-373. 
 prosperous peasants who become master and petty-master industrialists. 
 The poor peasants, on the other hand, do not, in the main, provide master industrialists but worker industrialists (wage-workers employed by “handicraftsmen,”migratory workers, etc. 
). 
 Unfortunately, for the overwhelm-ing majority of Moscow industries no data are availableon the farms of the wage-workers engaged in small indus-tries. 
 An exception is the hat industry (see general data on it in our table, Appendix I). 
 Here are exceedingly instruc-tive data on the farms of master hat-makers and workerhat-makers.

e. 
, are members of the peasantbourgeoisie, whereas the wage-workers are recruited fromthe mass of ruined peasants. 
 * Still more important for characterising the relations described are the data on the methods by which the master industrialists cultivate theirland. 
 The Moscow investigators distinguished three methodsof cultivating the soil: 1) by means of the personal labour *It is characteristic that the author of the description of the hat industry “did not observe” even here the differentiation of the peas-antry both in agriculture and in industry. 
 Like all Narodniks, helimited himself in his conclusions to the absolutely vapid banalitythat “industry does not prevent one from engaging in agriculture” (Industries of Moscow Gubernia , VI, I, p. 
 231) The social and eco-nomic contradictions both in the system of industry and in the system of agriculture were thus safely passed over. 
No.

 of horseless ones Arrears (rubles) of the householder; 2) by “hiring,” i. 
e. 
, by hiring some neigh-bour who tills the land of the “distressed” householder with his own implements. 
 This method of cultivation is characteristic of the poor peasant who is being steadilyruined. 
 Of opposite significance is the third method,namely, cultivation with the aid of a “labourer,” i. 
e. 
, thehire of agricultural (“land”) labourers by the farmer. 
 Theseworkers are usually hired for the whole summer; and, partic-ularly in the busy season, the master usually reinforces them with employees from his workshop. 
 “Thus, the method of cultivating the soil with the aid of the ‘land’ laboureris quite a profitable one” ( Industries of Moscow Gubernia , VI, I, 48). 
 In our table we have assembled the data on this method of cultivation for 16 industries, in 7 of which there are no masters who hire “land labourers. 
” In all these16 industries the master industrialists who hire rural labour-ers constitute 12% of the total, and by grades: I) 4. 
5%; II) 16. 
7% and III) 27. 
3%. 
 The better off the industrialists are,the more often we find rural entrepreneurs among them. 
 The analysis of the data on the industrial peasantry conse-quently reveals the same picture of parallel differentiationin both industry and agriculture that we observed in Chapter II on the basis of the data on the agricultural peasantry. 
 The hiring of “land labourers” by “handicraft” masters is very widespread in all the industrial gubernias. 
 We meet, for example, with references to the hiring of agricul-tural labourers by the rich bast-matting makers of Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia. 
 The furriers of the same guberniahire agricultural labourers, who usually come from the purely agricultural surrounding villages. 
 The “village-community peasants of Kimry Volost engaged in the boot industryfind it profitable to hire for the cultivation of their fieldsmen and women labourers who come to Kimry in largenumbers from Tver Uyezd and neighbouring . 
 . 
 . 
 localities. 
”The pottery decorators of Kostroma Gubernia send their wage-workers, when not occupied at their regular jobs, to work in the fields. 
 * “The independent masters” (metal-beaters of Vladimir Gubernia) “keep special field workers”; *Transactions of the Handicraft Commission , III, 57, 112; VIII, 1354; IX, 1931, 2093, 2185. 
 that is why their fields are well cultivated, although they themselves “quite often can neither plough nor mow. 
” * In Moscow Gubernia, the hiring of “land labourers” is re-sorted to by many industrialists apart from those about whomdata are given in our table; for example, pin-makers, felt-makers and toy-makers send their workers to jobs in thefields too; the glass-bead-makers, metal-beaters, button-makers, cap-makers and harness-makers employ agricultural labourers, etc. 
 ** The significance of this fact—the hiring of agricultural workers by peasant industrialists —is very great. 
 It shows that even in the small peasant industries the phenomenon characteristic of all capitalist countries is beginning to be manifested, and that goes to confirm the progressive historical role of capitalism, namely, a rise in the standard of living of the population, an increase in its requirements. 
 The industrialist is beginning to look down upon the “raw” agriculturist with his coarse patriar-chal manners and is trying to rid himself of the hardest and worst-paid agricultural jobs. 
 In the small industries, in which capitalism is least developed, this is to be ob-served very slightly as yet; the industrial worker is only just beginning to be differentiated from the agricultural worker. 
 In the succeeding stages of development of capitalist indus-try this phenomenon, as we shall see, is to be observed ona mass scale. 
 The importance of the “tie between agriculture and industry” compels us to review in greater detail the datarelating to other gubernias besides Moscow. 
 Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia. 
 Among the mass of bast-matting makers agriculture is on the decline, and they areneglecting the land; about 3 of the winter-crop area and 2 of the spring-crop area are “wasteland. 
” For the “well-to-do muzhiks,” however, “the land is no longer a wickedstepmother, but a mother bountiful”: they have enough ani-mals, they have manure, they rent land, they try to keeptheir strips out of the periodical redistribution and tend thembetter. 
 “Now the wealthy muzhik has become a landlord, while the other muzhik, the poor one, is in serf dependence *Industries of Vladimir Gubernia , III, 187, 190. 
 **Industries of Moscow Gubernia , loc. 
 cit. 
 upon him” ( Transactions of the Handicraft Commission , III, 65). 
 The furriers “are bad farmers,” but here too we must single out the bigger proprietors who “rent land from their poor fellow-villagers,” etc. 
 The following is a summary oftypical budgets of furriers of different groups: Income (in rubles)Expenditure (in rubles) Typesfromof fami-Wagelies ac-work-cordingersto eco-nomic strength Rich 14 3 2 19 5 — 212.

Concerning the blacksmiths, the investigator says that“industry is more important than agriculture” for the richmasters, on the one hand, and for the “landless” labourers, on the other (ibid. 
, IV, 168). 
 In Industries of Vladimir Gubernia the question of the relation between industry and agriculture is dealt with muchmore thoroughly than in any other work of investigation. 
For a whole number of industries precise data are given onthe farms, not only of “handicraftsmen” in general (such “aver-age” figures, as is clear from all the aforesaid, are quite fictitious), but of the various grades and groups of “handi-craftsmen,” such as: big masters, small masters, wage-*Transactions of the Handicraft Commission , III, 38, and foll.

)Rented LandLeased in kind in cash agriculture industry total in kind in cash total Balance Cash expenditure as % workers; workroom owners and weavers; master industrialists and the rest of the peasantry; households engaged in local and in outside industries, etc. 
 The general conclusion drawnby Mr. 
 Kharizomenov from these data is that if the “handi-craftsmen” are divided into three categories, viz. 
—1) big industrialists; 2) small and medium industrialists; 3) wage-workers, there is to be observed a deterioration of agriculture as from the first category to the third, a diminution in the amount of land and animals, an increase in theproportion of “distressed” farms, etc. 
 * Unfortunately, Mr. 
 Kharizomenov examined these data too restrictedly and one-sidedly, and paid no attention to the parallel andindependent process of the differentiation of the peasant agri-culturists. 
 That is why he failed to draw from these data the conclusion that inevitably follows from them, namely, thatthe peasantry both in agriculture and in industry are split-ting up into a petty bourgeoisie and a rural proletariat. 
 ** That is why, in describing the different industries, he quite often sinks to the traditional Narodnik arguments about the influence of “industry” in general over “agriculture” in general *See Yuridichesky Vestnik [The Legal Messenger ], 1883, Vol. 
 XIV, Nos. 
 11 and 12. 
 **How near Mr. 
 Kharizomenov was to drawing such a conclu-sion may be seen from the following description of post-Reform economic development which he gives in speaking of the silk trade: “Serfdom evened out the economic level of the peasantry: it tied thehands of the rich peasant, sustained the poor peasant and preventedthe family division of property. 
 Natural economy narrowed too muchthe arena for commercial and industrial activity. 
 The local marketdid not provide sufficiently wide scope for enterprise. 
 The peasant merchant or industrialist accumulated money—without risk, it is true, but very slowly—accumulated it and put it away in his chest. 
Beginning with the 60s conditions change. 
 Serfdom comes to an end;credit and the railways, by creating an extensive and distant market,provide scope for the enterprising peasant merchant and industrialist. 
All those who have been above the average economic level quickly get on their feet, develop trade and industry and extend their exploit-ing activities quantitatively and qualitatively. 
 All those who havebeen below that level fall, sink, drop into the ranks of the landless,the non-farming, the horseless. 
 The peasantry split up into the groupsof kulaks, semi-prosperous peasants and farmless proletariat. 
 Thekulak element of the peasantry rapidly copy all the habits of a cul-tured milieu; they live in grand style, and from them a huge class is formed of the semi-cultured sections of Russian society” (III, 20, 21). 
 127 (see, for example, Industries of Vladimir Gubernia , II, 288; III, 91), i. 
e. 
, to the ignoring of the profound contradictions in the very system of both industry and agriculture, the exist-ence of which he himself was obliged to admit. 
 Another investigator of the industries of Vladimir Gubernia, Mr. 
 V. 
 Prugavin, is a typical spokesman of the Narodnik views onthis subject. 
 Here is a sample of his reasoning. 
 The cotton-weaving industry in Pokrov Uyezd “cannot be regarded at all as a harmful factor (sic!!) in the agricultural life of theweavers” (IV, 53). 
 The data testify to the poor farms of the mass of weavers, and to the fact that among the workroom owners, farming is conducted at a level far above thegeneral (ibid. 
); from the tables it is evident that some work-room owners hire agricultural labourers too. 
 Conclusion: “industry and agriculture march hand in hand, conditioningeach other’s development and prosperity” (60). 
 A fine spec-imen of the phrases used to obscure the fact that the develop-ment and prosperity of the peasant bourgeoisie go hand inhand both in industry and in agriculture. 
 * The data of the Perm handicraft census of 1894-95 revealed the same thing: it is among the small commodity-producers (masters and petty masters) that the level of agri-culture is highest and rural labourers are met with; among the artisans agriculture is on a lower level, while among thecraftsmen who work for buyers-up the condition of agricul-ture is worst (as to the agriculture of the wage-workers and of various groups of masters, no data, unfortunately, havebeen gathered). 
 The census also revealed that the “handicrafts-men” who do not engage in agriculture differ from those who do in that 1) their labour productivity is higher,2) their net incomes from industry are incomparably higher, and 3) their level of culture and literacy is higher. 
 All these are evidences which confirm the conclusion drawn above, *Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
 confines himself to the same sort of phrases in dealing with this subject in Chapter VIII of his Essays on Handicraft Industry . 
 “Farming ... is sustained by industry” (205). 
 “Handicraft industries are one of the most reliable mainstays of agriculture in the industrial gubernias” (219). 
 Proof? Any amount: take, for example, the master tanners, starch-makers, oil-millers (ibid. 
, 224), etc, and you will find that their farming is on a higher level than that of themasses! namely, that even the initial stage of capitalism manifests the tendency of industry to raise the population’s standard of living (see Studies , p. 
 138 and foll. 
). 
 * Lastly, the following point is connected with the question of the relation of industry to agriculture. 
 The larger estab-lishments usually have a longer working period. 
 For example,in the furniture industry of Moscow Gubernia, the workingperiod of those working in plain wood equals 8 months (the average workshop staff here is 1. 
9 workers); for the bent-wood establishments it is 10 months (2. 
9 workers per estab-lishment), and in the heavy-furniture trade it is 11 months(4. 
2 workers per establishment). 
 In the shoe industry ofVladimir Gubernia the working period in 14 small workshopsequals 40 weeks, and that in 8 large ones (9. 
5 workers per establishment, as against 2. 
4 in the small workshops) 48 weeks, etc. 
 ** Naturally, this fact is connected with the large number of workers (family, hired industrial and hired agri-cultural) in the big establishments and explains the greatstability of these establishments and their tendency tospecialise in industrial activities. 
 Let us now sum up the data given above on “industry and agriculture. 
” It is usual at the lower stage of capitalismwhich we are reviewing for the industrialist still to bescarcely differentiated from the peasant. 
 The combinationof industry with agriculture plays an extremely importantpart in aggravating and accentuating the differentiation of the peasantry: the prosperous and the well-off peasants open workshops, hire workers from among the rural proletar-iat, and accumulate money for commercial and usurioustransactions. 
 The peasant poor, on the other hand, providethe wage-workers, the handicraftsmen who work for buyers-up, and the bottom groups of petty-master handicraftsmen, those most crushed by the power of merchant’s capital. 
 Thus, the combination of industry with agriculture consolidates *See present edition, Vol. 
 2, The Handicraft Census of 1894-95 in Perm Gubernia . 
—Ed. 
 **Sources are indicated above. 
 The same thing is revealed by the household censuses of the basket-makers, guitar-makers and starch-makers in Moscow Gubernia. 
 The Perm handicraft census also mentionsthe longer working period of the large workshops (see Sketch of Handicraft Industry in Perm Gubernia , p. 
 78. 
 No precise data, unfor-tunately, are given). 
 and develops capitalist relations, spreading them from indus-try to agriculture and vice versa. 
 * That characteristic feature of capitalist society, the separation of industry from agriculture, manifests itself at this stage in the most rudi-mentary form, but it does manifest itself and—what isparticularly important—in a way totally different from whatthe Narodniks imagine. 
 When the Narodnik says that industrydoes no “damage” to agriculture, he discerns damage in the abandonment of agriculture for profitable industry. 
 But such a notion is an invention (and not a deductionfrom the facts), and a bad invention at that, for it ignoresthe contradictions which permeate the entire econom-ic system of the peasantry. 
 The separation of industry fromagriculture takes place in connection with the differentia-tion of the peasantry, and does so by different paths at the two poles of the countryside: the well-to-do minority openindustrial establishments, enlarge them, improve theirfarming methods, hire farm labourers to till the land,devote an increasing part of the year to industry, and—at acertain stage of the development of the industry—find it more convenient to separate their industrial from their agricultural undertakings, i. 
e. 
, to hand over the farm toother members of the family, or to sell farm buildings, ani-mals, etc. 
, and adopt the status of burghers, of merchants. 
 ** The separation of industry from agriculture is preceded inthis case by the formation of entrepreneur relations in agri-culture. 
 At the other pole of the countryside the separation of industry from agriculture consists in the fact that the poorpeasants are being ruined and turned into wage-workers(industrial and agricultural). 
 At this pole of the countryside *For instance, in the woollen trade of Vladimir Gubernia the big “factory owners” and subcontractors are distinguished by the fact of their farming being on the highest level. 
 “During periods of stag-nation in production the subcontractors try to buy estates, to engagein farming, and to give up industry altogether” ( Industries of Vla-dimir Gubernia , II, 131). 
 This instance is worth noting, since facts of this kind sometimes lead the Narodniks to conclude that “the peasants are going back to agriculture,” that the “exiles from the soil must be restored to the land” (Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
 in Vestnik Yevropy , No. 
 7, 1884).

 it is not the profitableness of industry, but need and ruin, that compels the peasant to abandon the land, and not only the land but also independent industrial labour; here the process of the separation of industry from agriculture is one of theexpropriation of the small producer. 
 VIII. 
 “THE COMBINATION OF INDUSTRY WITH AGRICULTURE” Such is the favourite Narodnik formula with the aid of which Messrs. 
 V. 
 V. 
, N. 
 —on and Co. 
 hope to solve the problem of capitalism in Russia. 
 “Capitalism” separateindustry from agriculture; “people’s production” combines them in the typical and normal peasant farm—in this ingenuous contra-position lies a good part of their theory. 
We are now in a position to sum up as regards the questionof how in reality our peasantry “combine industry with agri-culture,” since a detailed examination has been made aboveof the typical relations existing among the agricultural and among the industrial peasantry. 
 Let us enumerate the diverse forms of the “combination of industry with agriculture” tobe observed in the economics of Russian peasant farming. 
 1) Patriarchal (natural) agriculture is combined with domestic industries (i. 
e. 
, with the working up of raw mate-rials for home consumption) and with corvée service for the landowner. 
 This form of combining peasant “industries” with agri-culture is most typical of the medieval economic regime,of which it is an essential component. 
 * In post-Reform Russia all that is left of such patriarchal economy—in whichthere is as yet absolutely no capitalism, commodity produc-tion, or commodity circulation—is vestiges in the shape of the domestic industries of the peasants and labour-service. 
 2) Patriarchal agriculture is combined with industry in the form of artisan production. 
 *Korsak, in Chapter IV of the book mentioned above, cites historical evidence of the following nature, for example: “the abbot gave out (in the village) flax for spinning”; the peasants were bound This form of combination is still very close to the pre-ceding one, differing from it only in that here commodity circulation manifests itself—when the artisan is paid in money and appears on the market to purchase tools, rawmaterials, etc. 
 3) Patriarchal agriculture is combined with the small-scale production of industrial products for the market, i. 
e. 
,with commodity production in industry. 
 The patriarchal peasant is transformed into a small commodity-producer, who, as we have shown, tends to the employment of wage-labour, i. 
e. 
, to capitalist production. 
 A condition for thistransformation is now a certain degree of differentiationamong the peasantry: we have seen that the small mastersand petty masters in industry belong, in the majority of cases, to the prosperous or to the well-off group of peasants. 
 In its turn, the development of small commodity productionin industry gives a further impetus to the differentiation ofthe peasant agriculturists. 
 4) Patriarchal agriculture is combined with work for hire in industry (and also in agriculture). 
 * This form is a necessary addition to the preceding one: there it is the product that becomes a commodity, here itis labour-power. 
 Small-scale commodity production inindustry is necessarily accompanied, as we have seen, by theappearance of wage-workers and of handicraftsmen who workfor buyers-up. 
 This form of the “combination of agriculture with industry” is characteristic of all capitalist countries, *As has been shown above, such confusion of terminology prevails in our economic literature and economic statistics that thecategory peasants’ “industries” is used to cover domestic industry, labour-service, handicrafts, small commodity production, trading, work for hire in industry, work for hire in agriculture, etc. 
 Here isan example of how the Narodniks take advantage of this confusion. 
Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
, singing the praises of the “combination of industry withagriculture,” points, in illustration, to the “timber industry” and“unskilled labour”: “He (the peasant) is strong and accustomed to hard work; that is why he can do all kinds of unskilled labour” ( Essays on Handicraft Industry , 26). 
 And this sort of fact figures among a heap of others to back the conclusion that: “We observe a protestagainst the splitting-up of occupations,” “the durability of theorganisation of production that arose when natural economy stillpredominated” (41). 
 Thus, even the conversion of the peasant into a lumberworker and unskilled labourer was passed off, among other and one of the most striking features of the post-Reform history of Russia is the extremely rapid and extremely wide incidence of this form. 
 5) Petty-bourgeois (commercial) agriculture is com-bined with petty-bourgeois industries (small commodity pro-duction in industry, petty trade, etc. 
). 
The difference between this form and the third is thathere petty-bourgeois relations embrace not only industry but also agriculture. 
 Being the most typical form of the combination of industry with agriculture in the economy ofthe small rural bourgeoisie, this form is therefore charac-teristic of all capitalist countries. 
 The honour of discov-ering a capitalism without a petty bourgeoisie fell to the Russian Narodnik economists alone. 
 6) Wage-labour in agriculture is combined with wage-labour in industry. 
 We have already discussed how such acombination of industry and agriculture manifests itselfand what it signifies. 
 Thus, the forms of the “combination of agriculture with industry” among our peasantry are extremely varied: there are those which express the most primitive economic system with the dominance of natural economy; there are thosewhich express a high development of capitalism; there area whole number of transitional stages between the formerand the latter. 
 By confining oneself to general formulassuch as: the “combination of industry with agriculture,” or the “separation of industry from agriculture”), one can-not advance a single step in explaining the actual processof development of capitalism. 
 IX. 
 SOME REMARKS ON THE PRE-CAPITALIST ECONOMY OF OUR COUNTRYSIDE The essence of the problem of “the destiny of capital-ism in Russia” is often presented as though prime import-ance attaches to the question: how fast ? (i. 
e. 
, how fast is capitalism developing?). 
 Actually, however, far greater importance attaches to the question: how exactly ? and to the question: where from ? (i. 
e. 
, what was the nature of the pre-capitalist economic system in Russia?). 
 The principal errors of Narodnik economics are the false replies given to precisely these two questions, i. 
e. 
, in a wrong presentation of exactly how capitalism is developing in Russia, in a false idealisation of the pre-capitalist order. 
In Chapter II (and partly in III) and in the present onewe have examined the most primitive stages of capitalismin small-scale agriculture and in the small peasant indus-tries; in doing so we could not avoid many references to the features of the pre-capitalist order. 
 If we now try to summarise these features we shall arrive at the conclusionthat the pre-capitalist countryside constituted (from theeconomic point of view) a network of small local markets which linked up tiny groups of small producers , severed from each other by their separate farms , by the innumerable medi-eval barriers between them , and by the remnants of medieval dependence . 
 As to the scattered nature of the small producers, it stands out in boldest relief in their differentiation bothin agriculture and in industry, which we establishedabove. 
 But their fragmentation is far from being confined to this. 
 Although united by the village community into tiny administrative, fiscal and land-holding associations, thepeasants are split up by a mass of diverse divisions intogrades, into categories according to size of allotment, amountof payments, etc. 
 Let us take, for example, the Zemstvostatistical returns for Saratov Gubernia; there the peasants are divided into the following grades: gift-land, owner, full owner and state peasants, state peasants with com-munity holdings, state peasants with quarter holdings, 128 state peasants that formerly belonged to landlords, appan-age, state-land tenant, and landless peasants, owners whowere formerly landlords’ peasants, peasants whose farm-steads have been redeemed, owners who are former appanage peasants, colonist freeholder, settler, gift-land peasants whoformerly belonged to landlords, owners who were formerstate peasants, manumitted, those who did not pay quitrent,free tiller, 129 temporarily bound, former factory-bound, etc. 
; further, there are registered peasants, migrant, etc. 
 All these grades differ in the history of their agrarian rela-tions, in size of allotments, amount of payments, etc. 
, etc. 
And within the grades there are innumerable differences of a similar kind: sometimes even the peasants of one and the same village are divided into two quite distinct catego-ries: “Mr. 
 X’s former peasants” and “Mrs. 
 Y’s former peas-ants. 
” All this diversity was natural and necessary inthe Middle Ages, in the remote past; at the present time,however, the preservation of the social-estate exclusivenessof the peasant communities is a crying anachronismand greatly worsens the conditions of the toiling masses, while at the same time not in the least safeguarding them against the burdens of the new, capitalist era. 
 The Narod-niks usually shut their eyes to this fragmentation, andwhen the Marxists express the view that the splitting upof the peasantry is progressive, the Narodniks confinethemselves to hackneyed outcries against “supporters of land dispossession,” thereby covering up the utter fallacy of their views about the pre-capitalist countryside. 
 Onehas only to picture to oneself the amazing fragmentationof the small producers, an inevitable consequence ofpatriarchal agriculture, to become convinced of the pro-gressiveness of capitalism, which is shattering to the very foundations the ancient forms of economy and life, with their age-old immobility and routine, destroying thesettled life of the peasants who vegetated behind theirmedieval partitions, and creating new social classes striv-ing of necessity towards contact, unification, and activeparticipation in the whole of the economic (and not only economic) life of the country, and of the whole world. 
 If we take the peasants who are handicraftsmen or small industrialists we shall find the same thing. 
 Their inter-ests do not transcend the bounds of the small area ofsurrounding villages. 
 Owing to the insignificant areacovered by the local market they do not come into contact with the industrialists of other districts; they are in mortal terror of “competition,” which ruthlessly destroysthe patriarchal paradise of the small handicraftsmen andindustrialists, who live lives of stagnant routine undis-turbed by anybody or anything. 
 With respect to thesesmall industrialists, competition and capitalism perform a useful historical function by dragging them out of their backwoods and confronting them with all the issues thatalready face the more developed strata of the population. 
 A necessary attribute of the small local markets is, apart from primitive forms of artisan production, primitive forms of merchant’s and usury capital. 
 The more remote a village is, the further away it is from the influence of thenew capitalist order, from railways, big factories and large-scale capitalist agriculture, the greater the monopoly ofthe local merchants and usurers, the more they subjugatethe surrounding peasantry, and the cruder the forms of this subjugation. 
 The number of these small leeches is enormous (when compared with the meagre produceof the peasants), and there is a rich variety of local namesto designate them. 
 Recall all these “prasols,” “shibais,”“shchetinniks,” “mayaks,” “ivashes,” “bulinyas,” etc. 
, etc. 
The predominance of natural economy, which accounts for the scarcity and dearness of money in the countryside, results in the assumption of an importance by all these “kulaks”out of all proportion to the size of their capital. 
 The depend-ence of the peasants on the money owners inevitablyacquires the form of bondage. 
 Just as one cannot conceiveof developed capitalism without large-scale merchant’s capital in the form of commodities or money so the pre-capitalist village is inconceivable without small tradersand buyers-up, who are the “masters” of the small localmarkets. 
 Capitalism draws these markets together, combinesthem into a big national market, and then into a worldmarket, destroys the primitive forms of bondage and personal dependence, develops in depth and in breadth the contradic-tions which in a rudimentary form are also to be observedamong the community peasantry—and thus paves the wayfor their resolution. 
 C H A P T E R VI CAPITALIST MANUFACTURE AND CAPITALIST DOMESTIC INDUSTRY I. 
 THE RISE OF MANUFACTURE AND ITS MAIN FEATURES By manufacture is meant, as we know, co-operation based on division of labour. 
 In origin, manufacture belongs directly to the above-described “first stages ofcapitalism in industry. 
” On the one hand, workshops witha more or less considerable number of workers graduallyintroduce division of labour, and in this way capitalistsimple co-operation grows into capitalist manufacture. 
 The statistics on the Moscow industries quoted in the pre-ceding chapter clearly show the process of this genesisof manufacture: the larger workshops in all fourth cate-gory industries, in some of the third category, and inindividual cases of the second category, systematicallyapply division of labour on a wide scale and must therefore be classed as types of capitalist manufacture. 
 More detailed data on the technique and the economicsof some of these industries will be given below. 
 On the other hand, we have seen how merchant’s capital in the small industries, upon reaching its highest stageof development, reduces the producer to the position of a wage-worker processing the raw material of others for pay-ment by the piece. 
 If further development leads to theintroduction of systematic division of labour into production and transforms the technique of the small producer, if the “buyer-up” singles out certain detailed operations and gets them done by wage-workers in his own workshop, if, parallel with the distribution of work to be done in thehome, and inseparably connected with it, big workshopswith division of labour emerge (belonging very often tothese same buyers-up), we are confronted with a processof the genesis of capitalist manufacture of another kind. 
 * Manufacture is highly important in the development of capitalist forms of industry, as the link between handi-crafts and small commodity production with primitive formsof capital, and large-scale machine industry (the factory). 
Manufacture is closer to the small industries because it continues to be based on hand technique, so that the big establishments cannot, therefore, fully displace the smallones, cannot completely divorce the industrialist fromagriculture. 
 “Manufacture was unable, either to seize uponthe production of society to its full extent, or to revo-lutionise that production to its very core (in ihrer Tiefe). 
 It towered up as an economic work of art, on the broad foundation of the town handicrafts, and of the rural domes-tic industries. 
” ** What brings manufacture closer to the factory is the rise of the big market, of big establishmentswith wage-workers, of big capital, which has broughtmasses of propertyless workers under its complete domination. 
 In Russian literature the prejudice regarding the isolation of so-called “factory” production from “handicraft” *For a description of this process of the genesis of capitalist manufacture, see Marx’s Das Kapital , III, 318-320.

, 267-270. 
130 “It was not even in the bosom of the old guilds that manufacture was born. 
 It was the merchant that became the head of the modern workshop, and not the old guild-master. 
” ( Misère de la philosophie , 190. 
131 We have had occasion elsewhere to enumerate the principal features of the concept manufacture according to Marx.

 2, The Handicraft Census of 1894-95 in Perm Gubernia .

132 production, regarding the “artificiality” of the former and the “people’s” character of the latter, is so widespread that we think it particularly important to examine the data on all the more important branches of manufacturing industry and to show their economic organisation after they had grown out of the stage of small peasant indus-tries, and before they were transformed by large-scale machine industry. 
 II. 
 CAPITALIST MANUFACTURE IN RUSSIAN INDUSTRY Let us begin with the industries that process fibres. 
 1) T h e W e a v i n g I n d u s t r i e s The weaving of linen, wool, cotton and silk fabrics, gal-loons, etc. 
, was organised everywhere in Russia as follows (before the appearance of large-scale machine industry). 
 The industry was headed by big capitalist workshopsemploying tens and hundreds of wage-workers; the owners of these workshops, possessing sizable capital, undertook the large-scale purchase of raw material, partly working it up in their own establishments, and partly giving out yarn and warp to small producers (workroom owners, middle-men, 133 subcontractors, peasant-“handicraftsmen” etc. 
) who wove the cloth at home or in small workshops at piece rates. 
 The work itself was done by hand, and the following operations were distributed among the workers: 1) yarn-dyeing; 2) yarn-winding (very often women and children special-ised in this operation); 3) yarn-fixing (“fixers”); 4) weaving; 5) weft-winding for weavers (bobbin hands, mostly children). 
 Sometimes in the big workshops there were special “threaders” (who threaded the warp through the eyes of the batten and reed. 
) * Division of labour is usually applied, not only to single operations, but to wares, that is, the *Cf. 
 Statistical Returns for Moscow Gubernia , Vol. 
 VII, Pt. 
 III (Moscow, 1883), pp. 
 63-64. 
 weavers specialise in producing various sorts of cloth. 
 The selection of some operations to be done in the home does not, of course, make any change whatever to the economic structure of this type of industry. 
 The workrooms or homes where the weavers work are simply external departments of the manufactory. 
 The technical basis of such industry is hand production with extensive and systematic division of labour; from the economic point of view we see here the formation of large capital which controls the purchase of raw materials and the sale of wares on an extremely extensive (national) market, and under whose complete sway are a mass of proletarian weavers; a few large establish-ments (manufactories in the narrow sense of the term) domi-nate a mass of small ones. 
 Division of labour leads to the emergence of specialist artisans from among the peasantry; non-agricultural centres of manufacture arise, such as the village of Ivanovo in Vladimir Gubernia (in 1871 it became the town of Ivanovo-Voznesensk and is now a centre of large-scale machine industry), the village of Velikoye in Yaroslavl Gubernia, and many other villages in Moscow, Kostroma, Vladimir and Yaroslavl gubernias,which have now turned into factory towns. 
 * In our economic literature and statistics the industry organised in this way is usually split up into two parts: peasants who work in their homes, or in not particularly big workrooms, workshops, etc. 
, are classed under “handicraft” industry, while the bigger workrooms and workshops are placed among the “factories and works” (and, moreover, quite fortuitously, since no definitely established and uniformly applied rules exist as to the separation of small establishments from big ones, of workrooms from manufactories, of workers occupied in their homes from workers occupied in the workshop of the capitalist). 
 ** Naturally, such classification, which places some wage-workers on one side, and some masters who hire these very wage-workers (in addition to the workers in their establishments) on the other, is nonsense from the scientific viewpoint. 
 *For a list of the most important towns of this type, see next chapter. 
 **Examples of such confusion will be given in the next chapter. 
 Let us illustrate this by detailed data regarding one of the “handicraft weaving” industries, namely, silk-weaving in Vladimir Gubernia. 
 * The “silk industry” is a typical specimen of capitalist manufacture. 
 Hand labour prevails. 
 Of the total number of establishments the small ones constitute the majority (179 out of 313, or 57% of thetotal, have from 1 to 5 workers), but in greater part they are not independent and are far behind the big ones in their significance to the industry as a whole. 
 Establishmentswith 20 to 150 workers constitute 8% of the total (25), but in them 41. 
5% of the aggregate number of workers are con-centrated, and they account for 51% of the total output. 
Of the total number of workers in the industry (2,823) there are 2,092 wage-workers, i. 
e. 
, 74. 
1%. 
 “On the job we meet with division of labour both in wares and in individualoperations. 
” Weavers are rarely able to make both “velvet” and “satin” (the two principal lines in this trade). 
 “The division of labour into separate operations within the work-shop is most strictly practised only in the big factories” (i. 
e. 
, manufactories) “that employ wage-workers. 
” The fully independent proprietors number only 123, who alonebuy the raw materials themselves and sell the finished article; they have 242 family workers and “employ 2,498 wage-workers, who in greater part are paid by the piece,” a total, consequently, of 2,740 workers, or 97% of the aggregate number of workers. 
 It is thus clear that the dis-tribution by these manufactory owners, through the mediumof “middle-men” (workroom owners), of work to be done inthe home is no special form of industry at all, but ismerely one of the operations of capital in manufacture. 
Mr. 
 Kharizomenov rightly observes that the “mass of smallestablishments (57%) alongside the small number of bigones (8%), and the insignificant number of workers employed *See Industries of Vladimir Gubernia , III. 
 It would be impos-sible and superfluous to give detailed data on all the weaving industries described in the literature on our handicraft industry. 
 More-over, in the majority of these industries the factory now reignssupreme. 
 On the subject of “handicraft weaving” see also Statistical Returns for Moscow Gubernia , Vols. 
 VI and VII.

 cit . 
 per establishment (7 2) conceal the true character of the trade” (loc. 
 cit. 
, 39). 
 The specialisation characteristic of manufacture is seen here clearly in the separation of theindustrialists from agriculture (the land is abandoned, on the one hand by the impoverished weavers, and on the other by the big manufactory owners) and in the formationof a special type of industrial population, who live much more “decently” than do the agriculturists, and look down upon the muzhik (loc. 
 cit. 
, 106). 
 Our factory statisticshave always registered only a very casually selected fraction of this industry. 
 * The “galloon industry” in Moscow Gubernia is capital-ist manufacture organised in a quite analogous fashion. 
 ** Such precisely is the case with regard to the printed calicoindustry in Kamyshin Uyezd, Saratov Gubernia. 
 Accord-ing to the Directory for 1890, there were here 31 “factories” with 4,250 workers and output totalling 265,000 rubles, while according to the List there was one “work-distributing office” with 33 workers in the establishment and an output totalling 47,000 rubles. 
 (In other words, in 1890 workers employed in the establishment and on the sidewere lumped together!) According to local investigators, in 1888 nearly 7,000 looms were engaged in producing printed calico, *** an output totalling 2 million rubles, and “the *The Military Statistical Abstract managed to count in Vladimir Gubernia, in 1866, 98 silk factories (!) with 98 workersand a total output of 4,000 rubles(!). 
 The Directory for 1890 gives 35 factories, 2,112 workers, and 936,000 rubles. 
 According to the List for 1894-95 there were 98 factories, 2,281 workers, with an outputof 1,918,000 rubles, and in addition, 2,477 workers “outside of establishments, on the side. 
” Just try to distinguish “handicraftsmen” here from “factory workers”! **According to the Directory for 1890 there were outside of Moscow 10 galloon factories, with 303 workers and an output totalling 58,000 rubles. 
 But according to Statistical Returns for Moscow Gubernia (Vol. 
 VI, Pt. 
 II), there were 400 establishments, with 2,619 workers (of whom 72. 
8% were wage-workers) and with an output totalling 963,000 rubles. 
 *** The Collection of Factory Inspectors ’ Reports for 1903 (St. 
 Petersburg, 1906) states that in Saratov Gubernia there were 33 distributing offices with 10,000 workers.

) whole business is run by a few manufacturers,” who employ “handicraftsmen” too, including children of 6 and 7 years of age for a payment of 7 to 8 kopeks per day ( Reports and Investigations , Vol. 
 I). 
 * And so forth. 
 2) O t h e r B r a n c h e s o f t h e T e x t i l e I n d u s t r y. 
 T h e F e l t T r a d e To judge by official factory statistics, felt production shows a very poor development of “capitalism”: in allEuropean Russia there are altogether 55 factories, with1,212 workers and an output totalling 454,000 rubles(Directory for 1890). 
 But these figures merely show a casually picked fragment of a widely developed capitalist industry. 
 Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia occupies first place for the development of “factory” felt production, and in thatgubernia the principal centre of the industry is the town ofArzamas and the suburb Viyezdnaya Sloboda (where thereare 8 “factories” with 278 workers and an output total-ling 120,000 rubles; in 1897 there were 3,221 inhabitants; and in the village of Krasnoye, 2,835). 
 It is in the environs of these centres that “handicraft” felt-making isdeveloped, in some 243 establishments, employing 935workers, with an output totalling 103,847 rubles ( Trans-actions of the Handicraft Commission , V). 
 To illustrate clearly the economic organisation of felt-making in this district, let us try the graphic method and indicate by specific symbols the producers who occupy special placesin the general structure of the industry. 
 It is clear, therefore, that the separation of “factory” and “handicraft” industry is purely artificial, that what wehave before us is a single and integral structure of industry which fully fits into the concept of capitalist manu-*The centre of this industry is Sosnovka Volost, where the Zem-stvo census of 1886 counted 4,626 households, with a population of38,000 persons of both sexes; 291 industrial establishments. 
 Altogetherin the volost 10% of the households were houseless (as against 6.

5% of the households cultivated on land (as against 22.

 ** From the technical aspect it is hand production. 
 The organisation of the work is that of co-operation basedon division of labour, which is here observed in two forms:as to wares (some villages specialise in plain felt, others *The sources are shown in the text. 
 The number of estab-lishments is about half the number of independent workers (52 establishments in Vasilyev Vrag, 5 #55#110 in Krasnoye village and 21 establishments in the 4 small villages). 
 On the other hand, thefigures for the town of Arzamas and Viyezdnaya Sloboda standsfor the number of “factories,” and not of workers. 
 **Let us note that the diagram given is typical of all Russian industries organised on the lines of capitalist manufacture: every-where at the head of the industry we find big establishments (some-times classed among “factories and works”), and a mass of smallVILLAGE OF VASILYEV VRAGVILLAGES OF KHOKHLOVO, DOLZHNIKOVO, SHATOVKA AND YAMISHGHY VILLAGE OF KRASNOYE VYAZOVOV AND OTHER BIG “FACTORY-OWNERS” IN VIYEZDNAYA SLOBODA AND ARZAMAS108 220110P10 J9 JP9S95 WUVYA 6UWU2Qabout 8: 52 220110J1004159 G in boots, hats, socks, etc. 
), and as to individual opera-tions (for example, the whole village of Vasilyev Vrag shapes hats and socks for the village of Krasnoye, where the semi-prepared article is finished, etc. 
). 
 This is capitalistco-operation, for it is headed by big capital, which hascreated large manufactories and has brought under its sway(by an intricate web of economic relations) a mass of smallestablishments. 
 The overwhelming majority of the pro-ducers have been transformed into workers performing one operation and producing for entrepreneurs under extremely insanitary conditions. 
 * The long standing of the industry and the fully established capitalist relations resultin the separation of the industrialists from agriculture:in the village of Krasnoye agriculture is in utter ruin, and the life of the inhabitants differs from that of the agricultural population. 
 ** Quite analogous is the organisation of the felt industry in a number of other districts. 
 In 363 village communitiesof Semyonov Uyezd in the same gubernia, the industry in1889 was carried on by 3,180 households, with 4,038 per-sons working. 
 Of 3,946 workers, only 752 worked for the market, 576 were wage-workers and 2,618 worked formasters on the basis, in greater part, of using the latter’smaterials; 189 households gave out work to 1,805 households. 
The big owners have workshops with as many as 25 wage-establishments completely under their sway—in a word, capitalist co-operation based on division of labour and hand production. 
 Non-agricultural centres are formed by manufacture in exactly the sameway, not only here, but also in the majority of other industries.

 **It is not without interest to note here the specific jargon of the inhabitants of Krasnoye; this is characteristic of the territorialisolation peculiar to manufacture. 
 “In the village of Krasnoye factories are given the Matroisk name of povarnyas (lit. 
 kitchens— Ed. 
).... 
 Matroisk is one of the numerous branches of the Ophen dialect, the three main branches of which are Ophen proper, spoken mainly in Vladimir Gubernia; Galivon , in Kostroma Gubernia; and Matroisk , in the Nizhni-Novgorod and Vladimir gubernias” ( Transactions of the Handicraft Commission , V, p 465).

 * The big owners are called thousanders ; their turn-over runs to from 5,000 to 100,000 rubles; they have their own wool warehouses, and their own booths for the sale ofwares. 
 ** For Kazan Gubernia the List gives 5 felt “facto-ries,” with 122 workers and an output totalling 48,000rubles, as well as 60 outside workers. 
 Evidently the latter arealso included among the “handicraftsmen,” concerning whom we read that they often work for “buyers-up” and that there are establishments having 60 workers. 
 *** Of 29 felt “factories” in Kostroma Gubernia, 28 are concentrated inKineshma Uyezd, and have 593 workers employed in theestablishments and 458 outside ( List , pp. 
 68-70; two of the enterprises have only outside workers. 
 Steam-engines already appear). 
 From the Transactions of the Handicraft Commission (XV) we learn that out of a total of 3,908 wool-carders and felt-makers in this gubernia, 2,008 areconcentrated in Kineshma Uyezd. 
 The Kostroma felt-makersare in greater part dependent or work for wages in extremelyinsanitary workshops. 
 **** In Kalyazin Uyezd, Tver Guber-nia, we find, on the one hand, that home work is done for “factory owners” ( List, 113), and, on the other, that precisely this uyezd is a centre of “handicraft” felt-makers; as many as3,000 of them come from this uyezd, passing through thewasteland called “Zimnyak” (in the 60s it was the site ofAlexeyev’s cloth mill), and forming “an enormous labour market of wool-carders and felt-makers. 
”( *) In Yaroslavl Gubernia outside work for “factory owners is also done”(List , 115) and there are “handicraftsmen” who work for merchant proprietors, using the latter’s wool, etc.

( **) They show that two-thirds of the total output and of the total number of workers are concentrated *Material for Evaluation of the Lands of Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia , Vol.

 in 18 establishments, which have an average of 15. 
6 wage-workers. 
 * The “handicraft” hat-makers perform only part of the hat-making operations: they make the shapes , which are sold to Moscow merchants who have their own“finishing establishments”; on the other hand, “clippers”(women who clip the down) work at home for the “handi-craft” hat-makers. 
 Thus, all in all, we find here capitalistco-operation based on division of labour and entangled in a whole network of diverse forms of economic depend-ence. 
 In the centre of the industry (the village of Klenovo,Podolsk Uyezd) the separation of the industrialists(mainly wage-workers) from agriculture ** is clearly to be seen, together with a rise in the level of the population’srequirements: they live “more decently,” dress in calico and even in cloth, buy samovars, abandon ancient customs, etc. 
, thereby evoking the bitter complaints of the localadmirers of old times. 
 *** The new era even occasioned the appearance of migratory hat-makers. 
 A typical example of capitalist manufacture is the cap industry in the village of Molvitino, Bui Uyezd, Kostroma Gubernia. 
 **** “The principal . 
 . 
 . 
 occupation in the village of Molvitino and in . 
 . 
 . 
 36 hamlets is the cap industry. 
”Agriculture is being abandoned. 
 Since 1861 the industryhas greatly developed; sewing-machines have become widelyused. 
 In Molvitino 10 workshops are busy all year roundwith 5 to 25 male and 1 to 5 female workers each. 
 “The best workshop . 
 . 
 . 
 has a turnover of about 100,000 rubles per annum. 
”( *) Work is also distributed to homes (for example, materials for the crowns are made by women in their homes). 
Division of labour cripples the workers, who work under themost insanitary conditions and usually contract tuberculosis. 
The lengthy existence of the industry (for over 200 years) has produced highly skilled craftsmen; the Molvitino craftsmen are known in the big cities and in the remote outer regions. 
 *Some of these establishments were occasionally included among “factories and works. 
” See, for example, the Directory for 1879, p. 
 126.

 (*) By some accident, such workshops have not yet been included among “factories and works. 
” The centre of the hemp industry in the Medyn Uyezd, Kaluga Gubernia, is the village of Polotnyani Zavod. 
 This is a large village (according to the census of 1897 it had 3,685 inhabitants) with a population that is landless andhighly industrial (over 1,000 “handicraftsmen”); it is thecentre of the “handicraft” industries of Medyn Uyezd. 
 * The hemp industry is organised in the following way: the bigproprietors (of whom there are three, the biggest being Yerokhin) have workshops employing wage-workers and circulating capital of more or less considerable dimensionsfor purchasing raw materials. 
 The hemp is combed in the“factory,” spun by spinners in their homes, and twistedboth in the factory and in the home. 
 It is warped in thefactory and woven both in the factory and in the home. 
 In 1878 a total of 841 “handicraftsmen” was counted in the hemp industry; Yerokhin is considered to be both a “handicrafts-man” and a “factory owner,” employing 94-64 workers in1890 and in 1894-1895; according to Reports and Investiga-tions (Vol. 
 II, p. 
 187), “hundreds of peasants” work for him. 
 In Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia, the rope industry is also centred in non-agricultural industrial villages, Nizhni Izbylets and Verkhni Izbylets in the Gorbatov Uyezd. 
 ** According to Mr. 
 Karpov ( Transactions of the Handicraft Commission , Vol. 
 VIII), the Gorbatov-Izbylets district is one large rope-making area; part of the inhabitants of thetown of Gorbatov are also engaged in the industry, and the villages of Verkhni Izbylets and Nizhni Izbylets are, in fact, “almost part of the town of Gorbatov”; the inhab-itants live like townspeople, drink tea every day, wearclothing bought in the shops, and eat white bread. 
 Alto-gether, as many as two-thirds of the inhabitants of 32villages are engaged in the industry, a total of 4,701 work-ing (2,096 men and 2,605 women) with an output of about 1 2 million rubles. 
 The industry has been in existence *Transactions of the Handicraft Commission , II. 
 **According to Zemstvo statistics (Vol. 
 VII of Material , Nizhni-Novgorod, 1892) in these villages in 1889 there were 341 and 119 households, numbering respectively 1,277 and 540 persons of bothsexes. 
 There were 253 and 103 allotment households. 
 Householdsparticipating in industries numbered 284 and 91, of which 257 and32 did not engage in agriculture. 
 There were 218 and 51 horselesshouseholds. 
 Those leasing their allotments numbered 237 and 53. 
 for nearly 200 years, and is now declining. 
 It is organised as follows: all work for 29 proprietors, using the latter’s materials, are paid by the piece, are “totally dependent upon the proprietors” and work from 14 to 15 hours a day. 
According to Zemstvo statistics (1889) the industry employs1,699 male workers (plus 558 females and males of non-working age). 
 Of 1,648 working only 197 work for sale, 1,340work for proprietors * and 111 are wage-workers employed in the workshops of 58 proprietors. 
 Of 1,288 allotment households, only 727, or a little over half, cultivate all theirland themselves. 
 Of 1,573 allotment-holding workingpersons, 306, or 19. 
4%, do not engage in agriculture at all. 
Turning to the question as to who these “proprietors” are,we must pass from the sphere of “handicraft” industry to that of “factory” industry. 
 According to the List for 1894-95 there were two rope factories there, with 231 workersemployed on the premises and 1,155 working outside, with anoutput totalling 423,000 rubles. 
 Both these establishmentshave installed motors (which they did not have eitherin 1879 or in 1890), and we therefore clearly see here the transition from capitalist manufacture to capitalist machine industry, and the transformation of “handicraft”work distributors and buyers-up into real factory owners. 
 In Perm Gubernia the handicraft census of 1894-95 reg-istered 68 peasant rope-and-string yards, with 343 workers(of whom 143 were hired) and an output totalling 115,000 rubles. 
 ** These small establishments are headed by big manu-factories, which are reckoned together, viz. 
: 6 ownersemploy 101 workers (91 hired) and have an output totalling81,000 rubles. 
 *** The system of production in these big es-tablishments may serve as the most striking example of“serial manufacture” (as Marx calls it 135), i. 
e. 
, the sort of manufacture in which different workers perform different *Cf. 
 Nizhni-Novgorod Handbook , Vol IV, article by Rev.

 To all appearances these same establishments also figure in the List , p. 
 152. 
 For the purpose of com-paring the big establishments with the small ones we have singledout the agriculturist commodity-producers, see Studies , p. 
 156. 
 (See present edition, Vol. 
 2, The Handicraft Census of 1894-95 in Perm consecutive operations in working up the raw material: 1) hemp scutching; 2) combing; 3) spinning; 4) coiling; 5) tarring; 6) winding on drum; 7) passing threads through perforated board; 8) passing threads through iron bush;9) stranding of plaits, twisting and gathering of ropes. 
 * The organisation of the hemp industry in Orel Gubernia is evidently similar: from among the considerable numberof small peasant establishments big manufactories emerge, principally in the towns, and are included among the “fac-tories and works” (according to the Directory for 1890 there were in Orel Gubernia 100 hemp-scutching factories, with1,671 workers and an output totalling 795,000 rubles). 
The peasants work in the hemp industry “for merchants”(probably for the very same manufacturers), using the latter’s materials, at piece rates, the work being divided up into special operations: “scutchers” scutch the hemp;“spinners” spin it; “bearders” trim it, “wheelmen” turn thewheel. 
 The work is very hard; many contract consump-tion and “rupture. 
” The dust is so thick that “unless accus-tomed you will not stay in it for a quarter of an hour. 
” The work is done in ordinary sheds from dawn to dusk, from May to September. 
 ** 4) T h e W o o d -W o r k i n g T r a d e s The most typical example of capitalist manufacture in this sphere is the chest-making industry. 
 According to the data, for instance, of the Perm investigators, “this indus-try is organised as follows: a few big proprietors, owningworkshops that employ wage-workers, purchase materials,partly make the wares on their own premises, but mainly give out material to small workshops making parts, and in their own shops assemble them and, after finishing, send the ready article to market. 
 Division of labour .

 III, p. 
 47 and foll. 
 **See Zemstvo statistical returns for Trubchevsk, Karachev and Orel uyezds of Orel Gubernia. 
 The connection between the big manufactories and the small peasant establishments is also evident from the fact that the employment of wage-labour develops in thelatter as well: for example, in Orel Uyezd, 16 peasant master spinners on the job extensively: the making of the entire chest is divided into ten or twelve operations, each separately per-formed by handicraftsmen. 
 The organisation of the industry consists in the combination of workers performing one oper-ation (Teilarbeiter, as they are called in Das Kapital ) under the command of capital . 
” * This is heterogeneous manufacture (heterogene Manufaktur, as Marx calls it136), in which the different workers do not perform consecutive operations in turning the raw material into the product, but make the various parts of the product, which are afterwards assem-bled. 
 The preference of the capitalists for the domestic workof “handicraftsmen” is to be explained partly by the above-mentioned character of manufacture, and partly (and mainly)by the cheaper labour of the home workers. 
 ** Let us observe that the relatively big workshops in this industry are sometimes also included among “factories and works. 
 ”*** In all probability, the chest-making industry is organised similarly in Vladimir Gubernia, in Murom Uyezd where,according to the List , there are 9 “factories” (all hand-operated), with 89 workers on the premises and 114 outside , and an output totalling 69,810 rubles. 
 The carriage industry, in Perm Gubernia, for example, is organised on similar lines: from among the mass of smallestablishments there emerge assembly workshops employingwage-workers; the small handicraftsmen are workers whomake parts of the carriages both out of their own materials, and out of materials supplied by the “buyers-up” (i. 
e. 
, owners of the assembly workshops. 
) **** We read about the Poltava “handicraft” carriage builders that in the suburb ofArdon there are workshops that employ wage-workers andalso distribute work to homes (the bigger masters having asmany as 20 outside workers).

 of labour as to wares is to be observed in the building of town carriages: some villages specialise in sleighs, others in wheeled vehicles, etc. 
 “The town carriages, com-pletely assembled in the villages (but without the metal-work, wheels or shafts), are sent to Kazan merchant custom-ers, who in turn send them to blacksmiths for the metal-work. 
 The carriages are then sent back again to the shopsand workshops in the town, where they are finished off, i. 
e. 
, are upholstered and painted. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 Kazan, where town carriages were formerly iron-mounted, graduallypassed this work on to handicraftsmen, who work at homefor a smaller payment than do the town craftsmen. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
” * Hence, capital prefers to distribute work to home workersbecause this reduces the cost of labour-power. 
 The organi-sation of the carriage industry, as is evident from the data quoted, constitutes, in the majority of cases, a system ofhandicraftsmen making parts, who are under the sway ofcapital. 
 The large industrial village of Vorontsovka, Pavlovsk Uyezd, Voronezh Gubernia (9,541 inhabitants in 1897), constitutes, as it were, a single manufactory of wooden articles ( Transactions of the Handicraft Commission , etc. 
 , Vol. 
 IX, article by Rev. 
 M. 
 Popov). 
 Over 800 houses are engagedin the industry (as well as some households in the suburb ofAlexandrovka, which has over 5,000 inhabitants). 
 Theymake carts, tarantasses, wheels, chests, etc. 
, to a total of about 267,000 rubles. 
 Less than one-third are independent masters; hired workers in masters’ workshops are rare. 
 ** The majority work to order for peasant merchants at piecerates. 
 The workers are in debt to the proprietors and areworn out by arduous toil: the people are growing feebler. 
The inhabitants of the suburb are industrial, not of the rural type, and scarcely engage in agriculture at all (except to work vegetable plots), since their allotments aremiserably small. 
 The industry has been long in existence, *Reports and Investigations , III. 
 **There are 14 big timber merchants. 
 These have timber-seasoning rooms (costing about 300 rubles), of which there are 24 in the village, each employing 6 workers. 
 These merchants also give out materials to workers, whom they get into their grip by advancing them diverting the population from agriculture and increasingly widening the rift between the rich and the poor. 
 The people subsist on meagre food; they dress “more smartly than before,” “but beyond their means,” in clothing that is entirelybought. 
 “The population has succumbed to the spirit ofindustry and trade. 
” “Nearly all who have no craft carry on the peasant has, generally speaking, become more unreserved, and this has made him more developed and resourceful. 
” * The celebrated wooden-spoon industry of the Semyonov Uyezd, Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia, is close to capitalist manufacture in its organisation. 
 True, there are no big work-shops standing out from among the mass of small workshopsand dominating them, but we find a deeply-rooted division of labour and the complete subjection of the mass of part-job workers to capital. 
 Before it is ready, the spoon passes throughno less than 10 hands, the buyers-up getting some of theoperations done by specially hired workers or giving themout to specialist workers (for example, for varnishing);some of the villages specialise in particular operations (for example, the village of Dyakovo specialises in spoon-finishing to the order of the buyer-up, at piece rates; thevillages of Khvostikovo, Dianovo and Zhuzhelka specialisein varnishing, etc. 
). 
 The buyers-up purchase the timberwholesale in the Samara and other gubernias, where theysend parties of hired workers; they own warehouses for raw material and manufactured goods, supply the most valuable material to handicraftsmen for processing, etc. 
The mass of workers doing part jobs merge into a single,complex mechanism of production, entirely under the swayof capital. 
 “It is all the same to the spoon-makers whetherthey work for hire at the master’s cost and on his prem-ises, or are occupied in their own cottages, for in this industry, as in others, everything has been weighed, meas-ured and counted. 
 The spoon-maker never earns more than *It will be appropriate here to note in general the process of development of capitalism in the timber industry . 
 The timber merchants do not sell the timber raw; they hire workers to dress it and to make various wooden articles, which they then sell.

 Under the influence of industry and trade, just enough to keep body and soul together. 
” * It is quite natural that under such conditions the capitalists who dominate the whole trade are in no hurry to open their own workshops, and the industry, based on hand skill andtraditional division of labour, stagnates in its seclusion andimmobility. 
 Tied to the land, the “handicraftsmen” seemto have become petrified in their routine: as in 1879, so in1889, they still count money in the old style, in banknotes and not in silver. 
 The toy industry in Moscow Gubernia is headed similarly by establishments of the capitalist-manufactory type. 
 ** Of 481 workshops, 20 have over 10 workers each. 
 Divisionof labour, both as to wares and as to individual operations,is practised on a very wide scale, enormously raising the productivity of labour (at the cost of crippling the worker). 
 For example, it is estimated that a small workshopyields a return of 26% of the selling price, and a big work-shop, one of 58%. 
 *** Of course, the fixed capital of the big proprietors is also much larger; technical devices aremet with (for example, drying sheds). 
 The centre of the industry is a non-agricultural township, the suburb of Ser-giyevsky (where there are 1,055 workers out of a totalof 1,398, with an output to the amount of 311,000 rublesout of a total of 405,000 rubles; the population, accordingto the 1897 census, numbers 15,155). 
 The author of thearticle on this industry, referring to the prevalence of small workshops, etc. 
, considers it more, but still not very, likely that the industry will develop into manufacture rather thaninto factory industry. 
 “In the future, too,” he says, “thesmall producers will always be able to compete more or lesssuccessfully with large-scale production” (loc. 
 cit. 
, 93). 
The author forgets that in manufacture the technical basis is always the same hand-production that obtains in the small industries; that the division of labour can never be such a *Transactions of the Handicraft Commission , Vol II, 1879. 
 See also Zemstvo statistical Material for Semyonov Uyezd, Vol. 
 XI, 1893. 
 **The statistics we have given (Appendix I to Chapter V, Industries Nos. 
 2, 7, 26) cover only a small fraction of the toy-makers;but these data show the appearance of workshops with 11 to 18 workers.

; and that manufac-ture is never in a position to embrace the whole of produc-tion, but remains a mere superstructure over the mass of 5) T h e P r o c e s s i n g o f L i v e s t o c k P r o d u c e. 
 T h e L e a t h e r a n d F u r T r a d e s The most extensive areas of the leather industry present particularly striking examples of the complete mergingof “handicraft” and factory industry, examples of capi-talist manufacture highly developed (in depth and in breadth). 
 What is characteristic is the fact that the gubernias which are conspicuous for the size of their“factory” leather industry (Vyatka, Nizhni-Novgorod, Permand Tver) are marked by a particular development of“handicraft” industries in this sphere. 
 In the village of Bogorodskoye, Gorbatov Uyezd, Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia, there were, according to the Directory for 1890, 58 “factories” with 392 workers and an outputtotalling 547,000 rubles; according to the List for 1894-95 there were 119 “works,” with 1,499 workers on the premisesand 205 outside, and with an output totalling 934,000rubles (the latter figures covering only the processing of livestock produce, the principal local industry). 
 But these data deal only with the top levels of capitalist manufacture. 
 Mr. 
 Karpov in 1879 computed in this villageand its environs over 296 establishments, with 5,669 workers (a large number of whom worked at home for capitalists), and with an output totalling about 1,490,000 rubles * i n the following industries: tanning, shingle-gluing, basket-weaving (for packing goods), harness-making, horse-collar-making, mitten-making and, standing by itself, pottery. 
 The Zemstvo census of 1889 listed 4,401 industrialists for this district, and of 1,842 workers for whom detailed infor-mation is given, 1,119 work for hire in other people’s work-shops and 405 work at home for masters. 
 ** “Bogorodskoye, *Transactions of the Handicraft Commission , IX. 
small establishments. 
 with its population of 8,000, is a huge tannery in continuous operation. 
” * To be more precise, it is a “serial” manu-factory controlled by a few big capitalists who buy the raw materials, tan the hides, and turn them into a varietyof articles, hiring several thousand absolutely propertylessworkers for the job and ruling over the small establish-ments. 
 ** This industry has had a very long existence, since the 17th century; particularly memorable in the industry’s history are the Sheremetevs (beginning of the 19th century), landlords who helped considerably to developthe industry and, incidentally, protected the proletariat,which came into existence here long ago, from the local rich. 
After 1861 the industry greatly developed, and particularlydid big establishments grow at the expense of the small ones; centuries of industrial activity produced from among the population remarkably skilled craftsmen who havecarried the trade all over Russia. 
 The firmly-rooted capi-talist relations have led to the separation of industry fromagriculture: hardly any farming is done in Bogorodskoyevillage itself, which, on the contrary, divorces neighbour-ing peasants who move into this “town” from the land. 
 *** Mr. 
 Karpov notes in this village “a complete absence of peasant characteristics among the inhabitants,” so that“you would never think you were in a village and not atown. 
” This village leaves Gorbatov and all the otheruyezd towns of Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia far behind, with the exception, perhaps, of Arzamas. 
 It is “one of the consid-*Transactions of the Handicraft Commission , IX. 
 **Thus, at the head of the horse-collar industry are 13 big proprietors, each with 10 to 30 wage-workers and 5 to 10 outsideworkers. 
 The big mitten-makers do the cutting in their own work-shops (employing 2 or 3 wage-workers) and get the mittens sewn off thepremises by from 10 to 20 women; these are divided into thumb-makers and stitchers , the former taking the work from the owners and sub-dividing it among the latter, whom they exploit (information for 1879) *** In 1889, of 1,812 households (with 9,241 inhabitants) 1,469 cultivated no land (in 1897 there were 12,342 inhabitants). 
 The vil-lages of Pavlovo and Bogorodskoye differ from the other villages ofGorbatov Uyezd in that very few of their inhabitants leave them; on the contrary, of all the peasants of the Gorbatov Uyezd who have left their villages, 14. 
9% live in Pavlovo and 4. 
9% in Bogorodskoye. 
The increase of the population between 1858 and 1889 was 22. 
1%for the uyezd, but 42% for the village of Bogorodskoye. 
 (See Zemstvo erable commercial and industrial centres in the gubernia, and its industry and commerce run into the millions. 
” “The radius of the industrial and commercial influence of Bogorod-skoye is very wide; but most closely connected with theindustry of Bogorodskoye is that of its environs within aradius of 10 to 12 versts. 
 These industrial environs are, as itwere, a continuation of Bogorodskoye itself. 
” “The inhab-itants of Bogorodskoye do not in the least resemble the ordinary, raw muzhiks: they are artisans of the burgher type, shrewd, experienced people, who look down on thepeasants. 
 The manner of life and the ethical standards of theBogorodskoye inhabitants are completely urban. 
” To thiswe must add that the industrial villages of Gorbatov Uyezdare marked by a relatively high level of literacy among the population. 
 Thus, the percentage of literate and student men and women is, in the villages of Pavlovo,Bogorodskoye and Vorsma, 37. 
8% and 20% respectively, asagainst 21. 
5% and 4. 
4% in the rest of the uyezd (see Zem-stvo statistical Material ). 
 Quite analogous (only on a smaller scale) are the relations in the leather-processing industries of the villages of Katun-ki and Gorodets (Balakhna Uyezd), Bolshoye Murashkino(Knyaginin Uyezd), Yurino (Vasil Uyezd), and Tubanayev-ka, Spasskoye, Vatras and Latyshikha in the same uyezd. 
These are similar non-agricultural centres with a “ring”of surrounding agricultural villages, and with similar diverse industries and numerous small establishments (and also workers in the home) subordinated to big entrepreneurs, whose capitalist workshops are occasionally included among“factories and works. 
” * Without going into statistical details, which will provide nothing new compared with what has already been said, let us merely quote the following extremely interesting description of the village ofKatunki: ** “A certain patriarchal simplicity in the relations between masters and workmen, which, however, is not so noticeable at first sight *See Zemstvo statistical Material for uyezds mentioned. 
— Transactions of the Handicraft Commission , IX and VI. 
— Directory and List . 
—Reports and Investigations , II. 
 **In 1889 it had 380 households (none cultivating land) with 1,305 inhabitants In the whole of the Katunki Volost, 90. 
6% of the and is, unfortunately (?), disappearing increasingly every year ... testifies to the handicraft character of the industries (?). 
 It is only recently that the factory character both of the industries and of the population has begun to be observed, under the influence, in partic-ular, of the town, intercourse with which has been facilitated by the inauguration of the steamboat service. 
 Today the village looks like a regular industrial township: there is no sign of agriculture what-ever, the houses are built close together as in the towns; the fine brick houses of the rich, and alongside of them the miserable hovels of the poor; the long wooden and brick buildings of the factoriescrowded in the middle of the village—all this sharply distinguishes Katunki from the neighbouring villages and clearly points to the industrial character of the local population. 
 The inhabitants themselvespossess features of character that also call to mind the type of “factory hand” who has already taken shape in Russia: a certain showiness in house furniture, in clothes and manners, spendthrifthabits of life in most cases, and little care for the morrow, a forward-ness and often affectation in speech, a certain superciliousness towards the country yokel—all these features are possessed by them in common with all Russian factory people. 
” * In the town of Arzamas, Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia, the “factory” statistics listed in 1890 a total of 6 tanneries, employing 64 workers ( Directory ); this is only a small frac-tion of the capitalist manufacture which embraces the fur,boot-making and other industries. 
 The same factoriesemploy workers in the home, both in the town of Arzamas (in 1878, estimated at 400) and in 5 suburban villages, where out of the 360 furrier households, 330 work for Arzamasmerchants, using their materials and working 14 hoursa day for 6 to 9 rubles per month **; that is why the fur-riers are pallid, feeble and degenerating folk. 
 In the suburb households are engaged in industries, 70. 
1% of working people being occupied in industries alone (i.

, not engaging in agriculture). 
 As regards literacy, this volost stands far above the average for the uyezd, yielding in this respect only to the Chernoretsk Volost, whichis also non-agricultural and has highly developed boat-buildingindustries. 
 The village of Bolshoye Murashkino had in 1887 a total of856 households (of which 853 cultivated no land) with 3,473 personsof both sexes. 
 According to the 1897 census, the population of Gorodets was 6,330, of Bolshoye Murashkino 5,341, of Yurino 2,189, of Spasskoye 4,494 and of Vatras 3,012.

 of Viyezdnaya Sloboda, of the 600 boot-maker households, 500 work for masters, from whom they receive the cut-out leather. 
 The industry is of long standing, being about 200 years old, and is still growing and developing. 
 Theinhabitants hardly engage in agriculture at all; theirwhole manner of life is purely urban, and they live “ingrand style. 
” The same applies to the furrier villagesmentioned above, the inhabitants of which “look down with disdain upon the peasant and call him a ‘country bumpkin ’. 
” * We find exactly the same thing in Vyatka Gubernia. 
 The Vyatka and Slobodskoi uyezds are centres both of“factory” and of “handicraft” leather and fur trades. 
 In theVyatka Uyezd, the handicraft tanneries are concentrated on the outskirts of the town and “supplement” the indus-trial activities of the big works, ** for example, by working for the big owners; working for the latter also, in the major-ity of cases, are the handicraft harness-makers and glue-makers. 
 The fur factory owners have hundreds workingfor them in the home, sewing sheepskins, etc. 
 This is just a single capitalist manufactory with branches: sheepskin-dressing and sheepskin-coat-making, leather and harness,etc. 
 Still more striking are the relations existing in the Slo-bodskoi Uyezd (the centre of the industries is the suburbof Demyanka); here we see a small number of big factoryowners *** at the head of handicraft tanners (numbering 870), boot-and mitten-makers (855), sheepskin-dressers(940), and tailors (309 make short sheepskin coats to orderfrom capitalists). 
 Generally speaking, such organisationof the production of leather goods is evidently very wide-spread: thus, in the town of Sarapul, Vyatka Gubernia, theList gives 6 tanneries, also making footwear, which employ, in addition to 214 workers on the premises, 1,080 outsideworkers (p. 
 495).

 depicted in such bright hues by all sorts of Manilovs, if all the Russian merchants and factory owners were to compute with equal detail and precision the outside workers employed by them? * Reference should be made here to the industrial village of Rasskazovo, Tambov Uyezd, Tambov Gubernia (populationin 1897 was 8,283), a centre both of “factory” industry (clothmills, soap-works, tanneries and distilleries) and of “handi-craft” industry, the latter being closely connected with the former; and to the industries: tanning, felt-making (as manyas 70 masters, and establishments employing from 20 to30 workers), glue-making, boot-making, stocking knitting(there is not a household where stockings are not knit fromwool that “buyers-up” give out by weight), etc. 
 Near this village is the suburb of Belaya Polyana (300 households), celebrated for industries of the same kind. 
 In MorshanskUyezd, the centre of the handicraft industries is the villageof Pokrovskoye-Vasilyevskoye, which is also the centre offactory industry (see Directory and Reports and Investiga-tions , Vol. 
 III). 
 In Kursk Gubernia, noteworthy as industrial villages and centres of “handicraft” industries are the sub-urbs: Veliko-Mikhailovka (Novy Oskol Uyezd; popula-tion in 1897 was 11,853), Borisovka (Graivoron Uyezd—18,071 inhabitants), Tomarovka (Belgorod Uyezd, 8,716inhabitants), Miropolye (Sudzha Uyezd, over 10,000 inhabi-tants. 
 See Reports and Investigations , Vol. 
 I, Information for 1888-1889). 
 In the same villages you will also find leather “works” (see Directory for 1890). 
 The principal “handicraft” industry is leather and boot-making. 
 It arose as *Cf. 
 also List , p. 
 489, regarding the well-known “handicraft” village of Dunilovo, Shuya Uyezd, Vladimir Gubernia. 
 The Directory for 1890 listed here 6 fur factories employing 151 workers, whileaccording to the Transactions of the Handicraft Commission (Vol. 
 X) there are about 2,200 furriers and 2,300 sheepskin-coat-makers inthis district; in 1877 as many as 5,500 “handicraftsmen” were counted. 
 Probably, the making of hair sieves in this uyezd is organised in the same way; in this industry there are engaged about 40 villages and asmany as 4,000 people, known as “Mardassers” (from the name of thisdistrict). 
 We have described the similar organisation of the leatherand cobbling industries in Perm Gubernia in our Studies , p. 
 171 and foll. 
 (See present edition, Vol. 
 2, The Handicraft Census of 1894-95 in Perm Gubernia . 
—Ed. 
) far back as the first half of the 18th century and reached the peak of its development in the 60s of the 19th century having become “a stable organisation of a purely commer-cial character. 
” The whole business was monopolised bycontractors, who bought the leather and gave it out to beprocessed by handicraftsmen. 
 The railways destroyed thismonopoly character of capital, and the capitalist contrac-tors transferred their capital to more profitable under-takings. 
 Today it is organised as follows: there are about 120 big entrepreneurs; they own workshops where wage-workers are employed, and also distribute work to homes;there are as many as 3,000 small independent masters(who, however, buy their leather from the big ones); thereare 400 people who work at home (for the big masters), and as many wage-workers; then there are the apprentices. 
 The total number of boot-makers is over 4,000. 
 Inaddition, there are handicraft potters, icon-case makers,icon painters, table-cloth weavers, etc. 
 A highly characteristic and typical example of capital-ist manufacture is the squirrel-fur industry in Kargopol Uyezd, Olonets Gubernia, described with such knowledge of the facts, and with truthful and artless presentation of thewhole life of the industrial population by a craftsman andteacher in the Transactions of the Handicraft Commission (Vol. 
 IV). 
 According to his description (in 1878), theindustry has existed since the beginning of the 19th cen-tury: 8 masters employ 175 workers, in addition to which they have as many as 1,000 seamstresses and some 35 familiesof furriers working for them at home (in different villages),1,300 to 1,500 persons in all, with an output totalling336,000 rubles. 
 As a point of interest, it should be notedthat when this was a flourishing industry it was not included in the “factory” statistics. 
 The Directory for 1879 makes no mention of it. 
 But when it began to decline the statisticsincluded it. 
 The Directory for 1890 listed for the town and the uyezd of Kargopol 7 works, with 121 workers and an out-put totalling 50,000 rubles, whereas the List gave 5 works, with 79 workers (plus 57 outside) and an output totalling 49,000 rubles. 
 * The order of things prevailing in this branch of *Here is some information about the “handicraftsmen” relating to 1894. 
 “The squirrel furs are sewn by some of the poorest women capitalist manufacture is very instructive as a specimen of what goes on in our age-old, purely native “handicraft industries,” that have been left stranded in one of Russia’s numerous rural backwoods. 
 The craftsmen work 15 hours aday in a very unhealthy atmosphere and earn 8 rubles permonth, less than 60 or 70 rubles per year. 
 The masters’incomes amount to about 5,000 rubles per annum. 
 Therelations between masters and workers are “patriarchal”: according to ancient custom, the master gives the workers kvass and salt gratis, which they have to beg from hiscook. 
 As a mark of gratitude to the master (for “giving”them work) the workers come, without pay, to pull squirreltails, and also clean furs after work. 
 The workers live in theworkshop all the week, and the masters knock them about, seemingly in a joke (p. 
 218, loc. 
 cit. 
), make them do all sorts of jobs, such as raking hay, shovelling snow, fetchingwater, rinsing clothes, etc. 
 Labour is astonishingly cheap inKargopol itself, and the peasants in the vicinity “are readyto work for next to nothing. 
” Work is done by hand, thereis systematic division of labour, and there is a lengthy apprenticeship (8 to 12 years); the lot of the apprentices can easily be imagined. 
 6) T h e R e m a i n i n g L i v e s t o c k P r o c e s s i n g T r a d e s A particularly noteworthy example of capitalist manu-facture is the celebrated boot industry of the village ofKimry, Korcheva Uyezd, Tver Gubernia, and its environs.

 Pletnev. 
 This work is the best for clarity of description of thewhole organisation of the industry. 
 The latest works give valuable The industry is a very old one, having existed since the 16th century. 
 Since the Reform, it has continued to grow and develop. 
 In the early 70s Pletnev counted 4 volosts in the area covered by this industry, but in 1888 the areaincluded 9 volosts. 
 Basically the organisation of theindustry is as follows. 
 It is headed by the owners of big work-shops employing wage-workers; they distribute the cut-outleather to be made up by outside workers. 
 Mr. 
 Pletnev counted 20 such masters, employing 124 adults and 60 boys, with an output totalling 818,000 rubles, while the number ofworkers occupied at home for these capitalists is estimatedby the author approximately at 1,769 adults and 1,833 boys. 
Then come the small masters, each with 1 to 5 wage-workersand 1 to 3 boys. 
 These masters dispose of their goods mainly in the village market in Kimry; they number 224 and have 460 adults and 301 boys working for them; outputtotals 187,000 rubles. 
 Hence, there are 244 masters alto-gether, employing 2,353 adults (of whom 1,769 work at home)and 2,194 boys (of whom 1,833 work at home), with an outputtotalling 1,005,000 rubles. 
 Further, there are workshops which do various individual operations: currying (skin-clean-ing with scraper); chipping (gluing of chips left from curry-ing); special carting (4 masters, with 16 employees and upto 50 horses); special carpentry (box-making), etc. 
 * Plet-nev calculated the total output at 4. 
7 million rubles forthe whole district. 
 In 1881 the number of handicraftsmen was computed at 10,638, and with migrants, 26,000, with an output totalling 3. 
7 million rubles. 
 As to conditions statistics and facts of the people’s life, but give a less satisfactory exposition of the economic structure of this complex industry.

 I. 
 *Cf. 
 Reports and Investigations : 7 groups of industrialists: 1) traders in leather goods; 2) buyers-up of footwear; 3) masters of bigworkshops (5-6 of them), who stock leather and distribute it to home workers; 4) masters of small workshops employing wage-workers; also give out material to home workers; 5) one-man establishments—working either for the market or for masters (sub 3 and 4); 6) wage-workers (craftsmen, journeymen, boys); 7) “last-makers, notchers, and also owners and workers in currying, greasing and gluing workshops”(p. 
 227, loc. 
 cit. 
). 
 The population of Kimry village, according to the 1897 census, is 7,017. 
 of labour, it is important to note the excessively long work-ing day (14 to 15 hours) and the extremely insanitary working conditions, payment in goods, etc. 
 The centre of the industry, Kimry village, “is more like a small town”(Reports and Investigations , I, 224); the inhabitants are poor agriculturists, and are engaged in their industry allthe year round; only the rural handicraftsmen give up theindustry during haymaking. 
 The houses in Kimry village are urban, and the inhabitants are distinguished for their urban habits of life (such as “showiness”). 
 Until veryrecently this industry was not included in “factory” statistics,probably because the masters “readily style themselveshandicraftsmen” (ibid. 
, 228). 
 The List has for the first time included 6 boot workshops in Kimry district, with 15 to 40 workers each on the premises, and with no outside workers. 
 Of course, it contains no end ofgaps. 
 Manufacture also includes the button industry of Moscow Gubernia, Bronnitsi and Bogorodskoye uyezds—the makingof buttons from hoofs and rams’ horns. 
 Engaged in this industry are 487 workers, employed in 52 establishments; the output totals 264,000 rubles. 
 Establishments with fewerthan 5 employees number 16; those with 5 to 10—26; thosewith 10 and more—10. 
 Masters who do without wage-workersnumber only 10; these work for big masters, using thelatter’s materials. 
 Only the big industrialists (who, as is evident from the figures given, should have from 17 to 21 workers per establishment) are quite independent. 
 It isthey, evidently, who figure in the Directory as “factory owners” (see p. 
 291: 2 establishments with an output total-ling 4,000 rubles and with 73 workers). 
 This is “serial manu-facture”; the horns are first steamed in what is called the “smithy” (a wooden hut with a furnace); then they are passed on to the workshop where they are cut up, after which they go to a stamping press, where the pattern isimprinted, and, lastly, are finished and polished on lathes. 
The industry has its apprentices. 
 The working day is 14hours. 
 Payment in goods is a regular thing. 
 The relations between masters and men are patriarchal, as seen in the following: the master calls the workers “boys,” and thepay-book is called the “boys’ book”; when the master pays the workers, he lectures them and never grants in full their “requests” for payment. 
 The horn industry, which is included in our table of small industries (Appendix I to Chapter V, Industries Nos. 
 31and 33), is also of the same type. 
 “Handicraftsmen” employingdozens of wage-workers figure also in the Directory as “fac-tory owners” (p. 
 291). 
 Division of labour is practised;work is also given out to home workers (horn trimmers). 
 The centre of the industry in Bogorodsk Uyezd is the big village of Khoteichi, where agriculture is receding intothe background (population in 1897 was 2,494). 
 The MoscowZemstvo publication stated quite rightly: Handicraft Industries of Bogorodsk Uyezd , Moscow Gubernia , in 1890 , that this village “ is nothing but a large comb manufactory ” (p. 
 24, our italics). 
 In 1890, over 500 industrialists were counted in this village, with an output of from 3. 
5 to 5. 
5million combs. 
 “More often than not, the horn dealer is alsoa buyer-up of finished goods, and in many cases a big comb-maker as well. 
” The position of those makers who are com-pelled to take horns “at piece rates” is particularly bad: “their position is actually worse than that of the wage-workers in the big establishments. 
” Dire need compelsthem to exploit the labour of their whole families beyondmeasure, to lengthen their working day and to put juveniles to work. 
 “During the winter, work in Khoteichi starts at oneo’clock in the morning, and it is hard to say for certain when it ends in the cottage of the ‘independent’ craftsman doing ‘piece-work. 
’” Payment in goods is widely practised. 
 “Thissystem, eliminated with such difficulty from the factories, isstill in full force in the small handicraft establishments”(27). 
 Probably, the horn goods industry is organised on similarlines in Kadnikov Uyezd, Vologda Gubernia, in the area of Ustye village (known as “Ustyanshchina”), where there are 58 hamlets. 
 Mr. 
 V. 
 Borisov ( Transactions of the Handicraft Commission , Vol. 
 IX) counts 388 handicraftsmen here, with an output totalling 45,000 rubles; all the handicraftsmenwork for capitalists, who buy horns in St. 
 Petersburg and tortoise-shell abroad. 
 At the bead of the brush industry in Moscow Gubernia (see Appendix I to Chapter V, Industry No. 
 20) we find bigestablishments with a large number of wage-workers and with systematic division of labour. 
 * It is interesting to note at this point the changes that took place in the organisation of this industry between 1879 and 1895 (see Moscow Zemstvo publication: The Brush Industry According to the Investi-gation of 1895 ). 
 Some well-to-do industrialists went to Moscow to carry on the industry there. 
 The number of indus-trialists increased 70%, the increase being particularly largein the number of women ( #170%) and girls ( #159%). 
 The number of big workshops with wage-workers diminished: the proportion of establishments with wage-workersdropped from 62% to 39%. 
 This was due to the fact that themasters began to distribute work to be done in the home . 
 The introduction into general use of the drilling machine(for making holes in brush blocks) accelerated and facili-tated one of the main processes in brushmaking. 
 The demand for “setters” (craftsmen who “set” bristle in the block) increased;and this operation, which became increasingly special-ised, fell to the lot of women, their labour being cheaper. 
The women began to work at home setting bristle, and werepaid by the piece. 
 Thus, the growing resort to domestic industry was caused in this case by progress in technique (drilling machine), progress in division of labour (the womendo nothing but set bristle), and progress in capitalist exploi-tation (the labour of women and girls being cheaper). 
 Thisexample shows very clearly that domestic industry by no means eliminates the concept of capitalist manufacture , but, on the contrary, is sometimes even a sign of its further development . 
 7) T h e P r o c e s s i n g o f M i n e r a l P r o d u c t s In the section relating to ceramics we get an example of capitalist manufacture in the industries of the Gzhel district (an area of 25 villages Bronnitsi and Bogorodskoyeuyezds, Moscow Gubernia). 
 The relevant statistics are givenin our table of small industries (Appendix I to Chapter V,Industries Nos. 
 15, 28 and 37). 
 From these data it is evident *The “sawyer” saws the brush blocks; the “borer” bores holes in them; the “cleaner” cleans the bristle; the “setter” “sets” the bristle;the “joiner” glues wooden strips on the brush backs ( Statistical Returns for Moscow Gubernia , Vol. 
 VI, Pt. 
 I, p. 
 18). 
 that despite the enormous differences between the three Gzhel industries: pottery, porcelain and decorative, these differences disappear as we pass from one grade of establish-ment to another in each industry, and we get a series ofworkshops of successively increasing dimensions. 
 Hereare the average numbers of workers per establishmentaccording to grade in these three industries: 2. 
4—4. 
3—8. 
4—4. 
4. 
—7. 
9—13. 
5—18—69—226. 
4. 
 In other words, the work-shops range from the very smallest to the very biggest. 
 There is no doubt that the big establishments belong to thecategory of capitalist manufacture (inasmuch as they havenot introduced machines, have not developed into factories);what is important, however, is not only this, but also thatthe small establishments are connected with the big ones ; that we have a single system of industry here and not separate workshops of one or other type of economic organisation. 
“Gzhel constitutes a single economic whole” (Isayev, loc. 
cit. 
, 138), and the big workshops in the district have grownslowly and gradually out of the small ones (ibid. 
, 121). 
The work is done by hand, * with considerable division of labour : among the potters we find wheel hands (specialising in different sorts of pottery), kilnmen, etc. 
, and sometimesspecial workers for preparing colours. 
 In the manu-facture of porcelain-ware division of labour is extremelydetailed: crushers, wheel hands, feeders, kilnmen,decorators, etc. 
 The wheel hands even specialise in the various kinds of porcelain ware (cf. 
 Isayev, loc. 
 cit. 
, 140: in one case division of labour increases productivity oflabour by 25%). 
 The decorators’ shops work for the porce-lain makers and are, therefore, only departments of thelatter’s manufactories, performing a special detailed oper-ation. 
 It is characteristic of developed capitalist man-ufacture that physical strength itself becomes a special-ity. 
 Thus, in Gzhel, some of the villages are engaged *Let us observe that in this industry, as in the above-described weaving industries, capitalist manufacture is, strictly speaking, the economy of yesterday. 
 Characteristic of the post-Reform era is the transformation of this manufacture into large-scale machine industry. 
 The number of Gzhel potteries using steam-engines was 1 in 1866, 2 in 1879 and 3 in 1890 (according to data in The Ministry of Finance Yearbook , Vol. 
 I, and Directory for 1879 and 1890). 
 (almost to a man) in clay digging; for heavy work not requir-ing special skill (grinding), workers from the Tula and Ryazan gubernias are employed almost exclusively, being superior in strength and vigour to the not very robustGzhelians. 
 Payment in goods is widely practised. 
 Agri-culture is in a bad way. 
 “The Gzhelians are a degeneratingrace” (Isayev, 168)—weak-chested, narrow-shouldered,feeble; the decorators lose their sight at an early age, etc. 
 Capitalist division of labour breaks up the worker and deforms him. 
 The working day is from 12 to 13 hours. 
 8) T h e M e t a l T r a d e s. 
 T h e P a v l o v o I n d u s t r i e s The celebrated Pavlovo lock and cutlery industries cover the whole of Gorbatov Uyezd, Nizhni-Novgorod Guber-nia, and Murom Uyezd, Vladimir Gubernia. 
 These indus-tries originated very long ago. 
 Smirnov states that as farback as 1621 there were (according to the cadastres 137) 11 smithies in Pavlovo. 
 By the middle of the 19th centurythese industries constituted a far-flung network of fullydeveloped capitalist relations. 
 After the Reform, the indus-tries in this district continued to develop and expand. 
 According to the Zemstvo census of 1889, in Gorbatov Uyezd13 volosts and 119 villages were engaged in industry; atotal of 5,953 households, 6,570 male workers (54% of thetotal number working in these villages) and 2,741 old men,juveniles and women, 9,311 persons in all. 
 In the Murom Uyezd, Mr. 
 Grigoryev in 1881 registered 6 industrial volosts, 66 villages, 1,545 households and 2,205 male workers(39% of the total number working in these villages). 
 Notonly were large, non-agricultural industrial villages formed(Pavlovo, Vorsma), but even the surrounding peasants werediverted from agriculture: outside of Pavlovo and Vorsma, in Gorbatov Uyezd, 4,492 persons were engaged in indus-tries, of whom 2,357, or more than half did not engage inagriculture. 
 Life in centres like Pavlovo has become quite urban and has given rise to incomparably more developed requirements, more cultured environment, clothes, manner of life, etc. 
, than among the surrounding “raw” peasants. 
 * *See above regarding the greater literacy of the population of Pavlovo and Vorsma and the migration of peasants from the villagesto these centres. 
 Turning to the economic organisation of the Pavlovo industries, we must first of all note the indubitable fact that the “handicraftsmen” are headed by the most typical capitalist manufactories. 
 For example, in the Zavyalovs’establishment (which already in the 60s employed over 100workers at the bench and has now introduced a steam-engine) a penknife passes through 8 or 9 hands: the forger,blade-maker, handle-maker (usually an outside worker), hardener, facer, polisher, finisher, grinder and marker. 
 This is extensive capitalist co-operation based on division oflabour, with a considerable number of the workers perform-ing individual operations employed at home and not inthe capitalist’s workshop. 
 Here are facts given byMr. 
 Labzin (in 1866) on the bigger establishments in the villages of Pavlovo, Vorsma and Vacha, covering all branches of production in this district: 15 proprietors had 500 work-ers occupied on the premises and 1,134 workers outside,making a total of 1,634, with an output totalling 351,700rubles. 
 How far this description of economic relations isapplicable to the whole district at the present time may be seen from the following data *: Number of persons engaged in industries and working Districts Pavlovo ......... 3,132 2,819 619 3,438 6,570 District around village of 2 Selitba .......

 Annensky’s Report , and also A.

 Potresov’s researches (cited above). 
 The figures for the Murom district are approximate. 
 The number ofinhabitants, according to the 1897 census, was 4,674 in Vorsma, and12,431 in Pavlovo. 
for the mar-ket for proprie-tors as wage-workers for proprie-tors and aswage-workers Total Approximate totaloutput (millionrubles) { Thus, the organisation of the industry as outlined by us prevails in all the districts. 
 All in all, about three-fifths of the total number of workers are employed capitalistically. 
 Here too, consequently, we find manufacture predominatingin the general structure of the industry * and holding masses of workers under its sway, without, however, being able toeradicate small production. 
 The relative tenacity of thelatter is fully explained, firstly, by the fact that in some branches of the Pavlovo industry mechanised production has not yet been introduced at all (for instance, in lock-making); and, secondly, by the fact that the small producertries to save himself from sinking by resorting to meansthat cause him to sink far lower than the wage-worker. 
These means are: lengthening the working day, and reducing the standard of living and of general requirements. 
 “The earnings of the group of handicraftsmen who work forproprietors are less subject to fluctuation (Grigoryev, loc. 
 cit. 
,65); at Zavyalovs’, for example, the lowest-paid workeris the handle-maker; “he works at home, and that is whyhe is satisfied with lower earnings” (68). 
 The handicrafts-men who work “for factory owners” are “able to earn some-what more than the average earnings of the one who takeshis products to the market. 
 Larger earnings are particularlynoticeable among the workers who live in the factories”(70). 
 ** The working day in the “factories” is from 14 2 to 15 hours, with a maximum of 16 hours. 
 “The working day of the home-working handicraftsmen, on the other hand, is never less than 17 hours and sometimes as muchas 18 and even 19 hours” (ibid. 
). 
 It would not be in the *The data we have given by no means express this predominance to the full: as will presently be seen, the handicraftsmen who workfor the market are subjugated to capital even more than those who work for proprietors, and the latter handicraftsmen even more than the wage-workers. 
 The Pavlovo industries show in strong relief that inseparable connection between merchant’s and industrial capitalwhich in general is characteristic of capitalist manufacture in itsrelation to the small producers. 
 **Connection with the land is also an important factor in reducing earnings. 
 The village handicraftsmen “on the whole earn less than the Pavlovo locksmiths” (Annensky, Report , p.

 True, we must bear in mind that the former grow their own grain, but even so “theconditions of the ordinary village handicraftsman can scarcely beconsidered better than those of the average Pavlovo locksmith” (61). 
 least surprising if the law of June 2, 1897138 caused an increase here in home-work; it is high time these “handi-craftsmen” directed their efforts towards compelling the proprietors to organise factories! Let the reader alsorecall the notorious Pavlovo “loan-purchase,” “exchange,”“wife-pawning” and similar forms of bondage and personaldegradation which grind down the quasi-independent smallproducer. 
 * Fortunately, rapidly developing large-scale machine industry does not so readily tolerate these worst forms of exploitation as manufacture does.

 This is also an industrial village, the major-ity of whose inhabitants do not engage in agriculture atall, and which serves as the centre of an industrial area ofseveral villages. 
 According to the Zemstvo census of 1889 (Material , Vol. 
 VIII, Nizhni-Novgorod, 1895), in the Bezvodnoye Volost (581 households) 67. 
3% of the house-holds cultivated no land, 78. 
3% had no horses, 82. 
4%engaged in industries, and 57. 
7% had literate persons andschoolchildren in the family (as against an average for theuyezd of 44.

 The Bezvodnoye industries are devoted to the production of various metal goods: chains, fish-hooks, and metal fabrics; the output was estimated at 2 2 mil-lion rubles in 1883 * and 1 2 million rubles in 1888-89. 
 ** The organisation of the industry is as follows: work for pro-prietors, using their materials, which is distributed amonga number of workers performing single operations and done partly in the employers’ workshops and partly in the home. 
 For example, in the making of fish-hooks the various oper-ations are performed by “benders,” “cutters” (who workin a special shed) and “pointers” (women and children whosharpen the hook-points in their homes); all these work atpiece rates for the capitalist, while the bender gives out work on his own account to the cutters and pointers.

 16,000 to 17,000 rubles. 
 If we add to this that division of labour is very widely practised here, * it will be clear that what we have is capitalist manufacture. 
 ** “ The sma l l industrial units, which are an anomaly under the existingconditions of technique and division of labour, can onlyhold out alongside the big workshops by lengtheningthe working day to the utmost” (Isayev, loc. 
 cit. 
, p. 
 33)—among the tray-makers, for example, for as long as 19 hours. 
 The ordinary working day here is from 13 to 15 hours; with the small proprietors it is from 16 to 17 hours. 
 Pay-ment in goods is widely practised (both in 1876 and in1890). 
 *** Let us add that the lengthy existence of this industry (it arose at the beginning of the 19th century, at thelatest) and extensive specialisation have, in this case too, produced highly skilled workers; the Zagarians are famed for their craftsmanship. 
 Specialities have also sprung up inthe industry which need no preliminary training and arewithin the grasp of even under-age workers. 
 “This verypossibility,” Mr. 
 Isayev rightly observes, “of becoming anunder-age worker at once and acquiring a trade, as it were, without having to study, indicates that the handicraft spirit, which demands the training of labour-power, isdisappearing; the simplicity of many of the detailedoperations is a symptom of the transition of handicraft tomanufacture” (loc. 
 cit. 
, 34). 
 Let us only observe that to acertain degree the “handicraft spirit” always remains in manufacture, for its basis is the same hand production. 
 *A copper-smith’s workshop needs five operatives to do the different jobs; a tray-maker’s at least 3, while a “normal workshop” needs 9 workers. 
 “In the large establishments” a “fine division” (oflabour) is practised “with the object of increasing productivity” (Isayev, loc. 
 cit. 
, 27 and 31). 
 **The Directory for 1890 gives for the district of Zagarye 14 factories employing 184 workers, with an output totalling 37,000 rubles. 
 A comparison of these figures with the above-quoted Zemstvostatistics shows that in this case too the factory statistics covered onlythe upper strata of widely developed capitalist manufacture.

 10) T h e J e w e l l e r y , S a m o v a r a n d A c c o r d i o n T r a d e s The village of Krasnoye, Kostroma Gubernia and Uyezd, is one of the industrial villages usually held up as centresof our “people’s” capitalist manufacture. 
 This large village(in 1897 it had 2,612 inhabitants) is purely urban incharacter; the inhabitants live like townspeople and (with very few exceptions) do not engage in agriculture. 
 Krasnoye is the centre of the jewellery industry whichcovers 4 volosts and 51 villages (including SidorovskoyeVolost of Nerekhta Uyezd), and in them 735 households andabout 1,706 workers. 
 * “The principal representatives of industry,” said Mr. 
 Tillo, “are undoubtedly the big indus-trialists of the village of Krasnoye: the Pushilovs, Mazovs, Sorokins, Chulkovs and other merchants. 
 They buy mate-rials (gold, silver and copper), employ craftsmen, buyup finished articles, distribute orders for work to be donein the home, supply samples, etc. 
” (2043). 
 The big indus-trialists have their workshops, so-called “rabotorni” (labo-ratories), where the metal is smelted and forged, then to be given out for finishing to “handicraftsmen”; they havetechnical appliances, such as “pretsi” (presses and diesfor stamping), “punches” (for embossing designs), “roll-ers” (for stretching the metal), benches, etc. 
 Division oflabour is widely practised: “Nearly every article passes through several hands in an established order in the course of manufacture. 
 For example, in the making of ear-rings,the master industrialist first sends the silver to his ownworkshop, where part of it is rolled and part drawninto wire; then on receipt of an order the material is givento a craftsman who, if he has a family, divides the work among several persons; one uses a punch to cut the silver plates into the shapes for the ear-rings, another bends thewire into the rings with which the ear-rings are attached *Transactions of the Handicraft Commission , Vol.

 to the ears, a third solders these parts, and, lastly, a fourth polishes the finished ear-rings. 
 None of this work is diffi-cult, or requires much training; very often the soldering and the polishing are done by women and by children of 7 or8 years of age” (2041). 
 * Here, too, the working day is excessively long, usually as much as 16 hours. 
 Payment inprovisions is common.

” * The samovar and accordion industries in Tula town and environs are highly typical examples of capitalist man-ufacture. 
 Generally speaking, the “handicraft” industriesin this district have a long history, dating back to the15th century. 
 ** They evidenced a particularly rapid development in the middle of the 17th century; Mr. 
 Borisov considers that the second period in the development of the Tula industries then began. 
 In 1637 the first iron foundrywas built (by the Dutchman Vinius). 
 The Tula gunsmithsformed a separate smiths’ suburb, constituted a separatesocial estate, enjoying special rights and privileges. 
 In 1696the first iron foundry was erected in Tula by a famous Tula blacksmith, and the industry spread to the Urals and Siberia. 
 *** Then began the third period in the history of the Tula industries. 
 The craftsmen set up their own workshopsand taught the trade to surrounding peasants. 
 In the 1810sand 1820s the first samovar factories were started. 
 “By1825 there were in Tula 43 different factories that belonged to gunsmiths, while those in existence at the present time nearly all belong to one-time gunsmiths, now Tulamerchants” (loc. 
 cit. 
, 2262). 
 Here, consequently, we observea direct continuity and connection between the old guild-masters and the principals of subsequent capitalist manu-facture. 
 In 1864 the Tula gunsmiths were freed from serf dependence 140 and assigned to the burgher estate; earnings dropped as a consequence of the severe competition of thevillage handicraftsmen (which caused a reverse flow ofindustrialists from town to country); the workers turned tothe samovar, lock, cutlery, and accordion industries (thefirst Tula accordions appeared in 1830-1835). 
 The samovar industry is at present organised as follows. 
 It is headed by big capitalists who own workshops employ-*Vestnik Finansov , 1898, No. 
 42. 
 **See Mr. 
 V. 
 Borisov’s article in Transactions of the Handi-craft Commission , Vol. 
 IX. 
 *** The Tula blacksmith, Nikita Demidov Antufyev, won Peter the Great’s favour by building an ironworks near the town of Tula;in 1702 he was granted the Nevyansk works.

 ing tens and hundreds of wage-workers, but they also distribute many separate operations to be done by workers, urban and rural, in their homes; those who perform these operations sometimes still have their own workshops andemploy wage-workers. 
 Naturally, side by side with thebig there are small workshops, with all the consecutivestages of dependence upon the capitalists. 
 Division oflabour is the general basis of the whole structure of this trade. 
 The process of samovar-making is divided into the following separate operations: 1) rolling the copper sheetsinto tubes (tubing); 2) soldering the tubes; 3) filing theseams; 4) fitting the bottoms; 5) beating out the shapes;6) cleaning the insides: 7) turning the bodies and necks;8) plating; 9) press-punching the vents in the bottoms and the covers; 10) assembling the samovars. 
 Further, there are the separate processes of casting the small copper parts: a)preparing the moulds and b) casting. 
 * Where work is given out to be done in the home, each of these operations mayconstitute a special “handicraft” industry. 
 One of these“industries” was described by Mr. 
 Borisov in Vol. 
 VII of the Transactions of the Handicraft Commission . 
 This industry (samovar tubing) consists in peasants doing at piece ratesone of the operations we have described, using merchants’materials. 
 The handicraftsmen left Tula town to work inthe countryside after 1861; the cost of living and standardof requirements were lower in the countryside (loc. 
 cit. 
, p. 
 893). 
 Mr. 
 Borisov quite rightly attributes this tenacity of the “handicraftsman” to the retention of hand-labour inthe beating out of samovars; “it will always be profitablefor the manufacturer to employ the village handicraftsman,because he works at from 10 to 20% below the rate of theurban artisan” (916). 
 Mr. 
 Borisov estimated the value of the output of samo-vars in 1882 at approximately 5 million rubles, the numberof workers (handicraftsmen included) totalling from 4,000to 5,000. 
 In this case also the factory statistics cover only *The Transactions of the Handicraft Commission , Vol. 
 X, contain an excellent description by Mr. 
 Manokhin of the samovar industry in Suksun, Perm Gubernia. 
 Its organisation is the same as that in TulaGubernia.

 Borisov’s article on handicraftindustries at the 1882 exhibition. 
 a fraction of capitalist manufacture. 
 The Directory for 1879 counted in Tula Gubernia 53 samovar “factories ” (all hand-operated) with 1,479 workers and an output totalling 836,000 rubles. 
 The Directory for 1890 gives 162 factories, 2,175 workers, and an output of 1. 
1 million rubles; the listof firms, however, contains only 50 factories (1 steam-operated), with 1,326 workers and an output totalling 698,000rubles. 
 Evidently, some hundred small establishments were in this case classed as “factories. 
” Lastly, the List gives the following for 1894-95: 25 factories (4 steam-operated), 1,202 workers ( #607 outside), and an output totalling 1,613,000 rubles. 
 In these data neither the number of factories nor thenumber of workers are comparable (for the reason given above,and also because of the lumping together in previous years of workers on the premises and outside). 
 The only thing beyond doubt is that manufacture is being steadily dis-placed by large-scale machine industry: in 1879, therewere 2 factories with 100 and more workers; in 1890 therewere 2 (one steam-operated) and in 1894-95 there were 4(three steam-operated). 
 * The accordion industry, which is at a lower stage of economic development, is organised in precisely the sameway. 
 ** “In the making of accordions there are over ten separate trades” ( Transactions of the Handicraft Commis-sion , IX, 236); the making of the different parts of an accordion or the performance of some of the operations constitute separate, quasi-independent “handicraft” indus-tries. 
 “When things are quiet all the handicraftsmen work *Evidently there are analogous features in the organisation of the mechanical trades in Tula and its environs. 
 Mr. 
 Borisov in 1882 estimated that the number of workers employed in these industrieswas from 2,000 to 3,000, producing wares to a value of nearly 2 2 mil-lion rubles. 
 These “handicraftsmen” are very much under the heel ofmerchant’s capital. 
 The hardware “factories” in Tula Gubernia sometimes also have outside workers (cf. 
 List, pp. 
 393-395). 
 **The development of accordion-making is also interesting as a process of the elimination of primitive folk instruments and of the creation of a wide, national market; without this market there couldhave been no division of labour by processes, and without divisionof labour the finished article could not have been produced cheaply: displaced the primitive string folk instrument, the balalaika” ( Trans-actions of the Handicraft Commission , Vol. 
 IX, p. 
 2276). 
 “Owing to their cheapness . 
 . 
 . 
 the accordions have nearly everywhere for factories or for more or less big workshops, the own-ers of which supply them with materials; when, however, there is a brisk demand for accordions, a large number of small producers appear, who buy up parts from the handi-craftsmen, assemble them and take the finished articles tothe local shops where accordions are very readily purchased”(ibid. 
). 
 Mr. 
 Borisov in 1882 estimated from 2,000 to 3,000workers in this industry, with an output totalling about 4 million rubles; factory statistics in 1879 showed two “factories,” with 22 workers and an output totalling 5,000rubles; in 1890, 19 factories, with 275 workers and anoutput totalling 82,000 rubles; in 1894-95 one factory,with 23 workers (plus 17 outside) and an output totalling20,000 rubles. 
 * Steam-engines are not employed at all. 
 All these figure variations indicate a purely haphazard pickingof individual establishments which are component partsof the complex organism of capitalist manufacture. 
 III. 
 TECHNIQUE IN MANUFACTURE. 
 DIVISION OF LABOUR AND ITS SIGNIFICANCE Let us now draw conclusions from the foregoing data and see whether they are really indicative of a specialstage in the development of capitalism in our industry. 
 The feature common to all the industries we have examined is the retention of hand production and systematic, widely practised division of labour. 
 The process of produc-tion is split up into several single operations performedby different specialist craftsmen. 
 The training of suchspecialists takes a fairly long time, and therefore a naturalconcomitant of manufacture is apprenticeship . 
 It is well known that under the general conditions of commodityeconomy and capitalism this gives rise to the worst forms of *The Tula town census of November 29, 1891, gave 36 establish-ments selling accordions and 34 accordion workshops (see Tula Gubernia Handbook for 1895, Tula, 1895). 
 personal dependence and exploitation. 
 * The disappearance of apprenticeship is connected with a higher development of manufacture and with the advent of large-scale machine industry, when machines reduce the period of train-ing to a minimum or when such simple single operationsarise as can be done even by children (see above exampleof Zagarye). 
 The retention of hand production as the basis of manu-facture explains its comparative immobility, which is particularly striking when compared with the factory. 
The development and extension of division of labourproceeds very slowly, so that for whole decades (and evencenturies) manufacture retains its form once it has beenadopted; as we have seen, quite a number of the industries examined are of quite ancient origin, yet no great changes in methods of production have been observed in themajority of them until recently. 
 As for division of labour, we shall not repeat here the commonly known tenets of theoretical economics concern-ing the part it plays in the process of development of the productive powers of labour. 
 On the basis of hand produc-tion no other progress in technique was possible except bydivision of labour. 
 ** Let us merely note the two major circumstances that make clear the need for division oflabour as a preparatory stage for large-scale machine indus-try. 
 Firstly, the introduction of machines is possible only when the production process has been split into a number of the simplest, purely mechanical operations; machines are *Let us confine ourselves to one example. 
 In the village of Borisovka, Graivoron Uyezd, Kursk Gubernia, there is an icon-painting industry, employing about 500 persons. 
 The majority of the crafts-men hire no workers, but keep apprentices, who work from 14 to 15hours a day. 
 When a proposal was made to set up an art school, thesecraftsmen strongly opposed it, for fear of losing the gratuitous labour-power of their apprentices ( Reports and Investigations , I, 333). 
 In domestic industry the conditions of children under capitalist manu-facture are no better than those of apprentices, since the domestic worker is compelled to lengthen the working day and exert all theefforts of his family to the utmost. 
 **“The domestic form of large-scale production and manufacture are an inevitable and to a certain extent even a desirable way outfor small independent industry when it covers a large district” (Kha-rizomenov, in Yuridichesky Vestnik , 1883, No. 
 11, p. 
 435). 
 first used for the simplest operations and their spread to the more complicated processes is very gradual. 
 For example, in weaving, the power-loom has long predominated in the production of plain fabrics, whereas silk weaving continuesto be carried on mainly by hand; in the engineering tradethe machine is applied first of all to one of the simplestoperations—grinding, etc. 
 But this splitting of productioninto the simplest operations, while being a necessary prepar-atory step to the introduction of large-scale machine production, leads at the same time to a growth of smallindustries. 
 The surrounding population is enabled to performsuch detailed operations in its homes, either to order ofthe manufactory owners, using their materials (bristle-setting in brush manufacture, sewing sheepskins, sheepskin coats, mittens, boots, etc. 
, in the leather trade, horn-trimming in comb manufacture, samovar “tubing,” etc. 
),or even “independently” buying the materials, makingcertain parts of the product and selling them to the manu-facturers (in the hat, carriage, accordion and other indus-tries, etc. 
). 
 It seems paradoxical that the growth of small (sometimes even “independent”) industries should be an expression of the growth of capitalist manufacture: never-theless it is a fact. 
 The “independence” of such “handicrafts-men” is quite fictitious. 
 Their work could not be done,and their product would on occasion even have no use-value,if there were no connection with other detailed operations, with other parts of the product. 
 And only big capital , ruling (in one form or another) over a mass of workersperforming separate operations was able * to and did create this connection. 
 One of the main errors of Narodnik econom-ics is that it ignores or obscures the fact that the “handi-craftsman” performing a single operation is a constituent part of the capitalist manufactory. 
 The second circumstance that must particularly be stressed is that manufacture trains skilled workers. 
 Large-scale machine industry could not have developed so quickly *Why is it that only capital was able to create this connection? Because, as we have seen, commodity production gives rise to thescattered condition of the small producers and to their completedifferentiation, and because the small industries bequeathed tomanufacture a heritage of capitalist workshops and merchant’s capital. 
 in the post-Reform period had it not been preceded by a long period in which manufacture trained workers. 
 For instance, the investigators of the “handicraft” weaving industry of the Pokrov Uyezd, Vladimir Gubernia, note theremarkable “technical skill and experience” of the weaversof Kudykino Volost (where the village of Orekhovo and thefamous Morozov mills are situated): “nowhere. 
 . 
 . 
 do we findsuch intensity . 
 . 
 . 
 of labour . 
 . 
 . 
 ; a strict division of labour between the weaver and the bobbin-hand is invariably prac-tised here. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
” “The past . 
 . 
 . 
 has imparted to the Kudykin-ians . 
 . 
 . 
 expert skill in the technique of production . 
 . 
 . 
 anability to cope with all sorts of difficulties. 
” * “Factories cannot be erected in any village and in any number,” weread in reference to silk weaving: “the factory must follow the weaver into the villages where, due to migratory labour” (or, let us add, due to domestic industry), “a contingent ofproficient workers has been formed. 
” ** Establishments like the St. 
 Petersburg boot factory141*** could not have devel-oped so quickly if in the district around Kimry village, say,skilled workers who have now taken to migration had not been developing for centuries, etc. 
 That, incidentally, is why very great importance attaches to the formation bymanufacture of a whole number of large districts whichspecialised in certain trades and trained large numbers ofskilled workers. 
 **** Division of labour in capitalist manufacture disfigures and cripples the worker, including the “handicraftsman” who makes single parts. 
 It produces virtuosi and cripples; the former as rare exceptions, whose skill arouses the *Industries of Vladimir Gubernia , IV, 22. 
 **Ibid. 
, III, 63. 
 *** In 1890 it had 514 workers and an output of 600,000 rubles; in 1894-95, 845 workers, output 1,288,000 rubles. 
 **** This is very aptly described by the term “wholesale crafts. 
” “Beginning with the 17th century,” writes Korsak, “rural industrybegan to develop more perceptibly; whole villages, especially thosenear Moscow and situated along the high roads, began to engage insome particular industry; the inhabitants of some became tanners,of others weavers, and of still others dyers, cartwrights, smiths, etc.... 
 Towards the close of the last century very many of these wholesale crafts , as some call them, had developed in Russia” (loc.

 IV. 
 THE TERRITORIAL DIVISION OF LABOUR AND THE SEPARATION OF AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY Directly connected with division of labour in general is, as has been noted, territorial division of labour—the specialisation of certain districts in the production ofsome one product, of one sort of product and even of acertain part of a product. 
 The predominance of handproduction, the existence of a mass of small establishments, the preservation of the worker’s connection with the land, the tying of the craftsman to a given trade,—all this inevitably gives rise to the seclusion of the differentindustrial districts of manufacture; sometimes this localseclusion amounts to complete isolation from the rest ofthe world, *** with which only the merchant masters have dealings. 
 In the following effusion Mr. 
 Kharizomenov underrates the significance of the territorial division of labour: “Thevast distances of the Empire go hand in hand with sharpdifferences of natural conditions: one locality is rich in tim-ber and wild animals, another in cattle, while a third abounds in clay or iron. 
 These natural features determined the character of industry. 
 The great distances and incon-*Let us confine ourselves to two examples: Khvorov, the cele-brated Pavlovo locksmith, made 24 locks to a weight of one zolotnik (4. 
25 grammes. 
—Ed. 
); some of the parts of these locks were no largerthan a pin’s head (Labzin, loc. 
 cit. 
, 44). 
 One toy-maker in Moscow Gubernia spent nearly all his life finishing harnessed horses and achieved such dexterity that he could finish 400 a day ( Statistical Returns for Moscow Gubernia , Vol. 
 VI, Pt. 
 II, pp. 
 38-39). 
 **This is how Mr. 
 Grigoryev describes the Pavlovo handicrafts-at the same vice and had with his bare left foot worn more than half-way through the board on which he stood; with bitter irony he said that the employer intended to get rid of him when he had worn theboard right through” (op.

 who for six years had been working veniences of communication made the transport of raw materials impossible, or extremely costly. 
 As a result, industry had necessarily to nestle where an abundance of raw material was close at hand. 
 Hence the characteristicfeature of our industry—the specialisation of commodityproduction in large and compact areas” ( Yuridichesky Vestnik , loc. 
 cit. 
, p. 
 440). 
 Territorial division of labour is not a characteristic feature of our industry, but of manufacture (both in Russia and in other countries); the small industries did notproduce such extensive districts, while the factory brokedown their seclusion and facilitated the transfer of estab-lishments and masses of workers to other places. 
 Manufac-ture not only creates compact areas, but introduces specialisation within these areas (division of labour as to wares). 
 The availability of raw materials in the givenlocality is not at all essential for manufacture, and is hardlyeven usual for it, for manufacture presupposes fairly widecommercial intercourse. 
 * Connected with the above-described features of manu-facture is the circumstance that this stage of capitalist evolution is marked by a specific form of separation ofagriculture from industry. 
 It is no longer the peasant whois the most typical industrialist, but the non-farming“artisan” (and at the other pole—the merchant and the work-shop owner). 
 In most cases (as we have seen) the industries organised on the lines of manufacture have non-agricultu-ral centres: either towns or (much more often) villages, whose inhabitants hardly engage in agriculture at all, and which should be classed as settlements of a commer-cial and industrial character. 
 The separation of industry from agriculture is here deeply rooted in the technique of manufacture, in its economy, and in the peculiarities of its way of life (or culture). 
 Technique ties the worker to one trade and therefore, on the one hand, renders him unfit for agriculture (physically weak, etc. 
), and, on the *Imported (i. 
e. 
, not local) raw material is used in the weaving industries, the Pavlovo and Gzhel industries, the Perm leatherindustries, and many others (cf. 
 Studies , pp. 
 122-124). 
 (See present edition, Vol. 
 2, The Handicraft Census of 1894-95 in Perm Gubernia . 
—Ed. 
) other, demands continuous and long pursuit of the craft. 
 The economic structure of manufacture is characterised by a far deeper differentiation among the industrialists than is the case in the small industries; and we haveseen that in the small industries, differentiation in indus-try is paralleled by differentiation in agriculture. 
 Withthe utter pauperisation of the mass of producers, whichis a condition and a consequence of manufacture, its work-ing personnel cannot be recruited from among farmers who are at all economically sound. 
 Among the culturalpeculiarities of manufacture are, firstly, the very lengthy(sometimes age-old) existence of the industry, whichleaves its impress upon the population; and secondly, thehigher standard of living of the population. 
 * We shall deal with the latter circumstance in greater detail further on, but first let us note that manufacture does not bring aboutthe complete separation of industry from agriculture. 
 Underhand technique the big establishments cannot eliminate thesmall ones completely, especially if the small handicrafts-men lengthen their working day and reduce the level of their requirements: under such conditions, manufacture, as we have seen, even develops the small industries. 
 It is natu-ral, therefore, that in the majority of cases we see aroundthe non-agricultural centre of manufacture a whole regionof agricultural settlements, the inhabitants of which alsoengage in industries. 
 Hence, in this respect, too, we find clearly revealed the transitional character of manufacture between small hand production and the factory. 
 If even in *Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
 in his Essays on Handicraft Industry , assures us that “in our country ... there are very few localities of handicraft industrywhere agriculture has been entirely abandoned (36)—we have shownabove that, on the contrary, there are very many—and that “theslight manifestations of division of labour that we observe in ourcountry must be ascribed not so much to the energy of industrial progress as to the immobility of the size of peasant holdings...” (40). 
 Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
 fails to notice that these “localities of handicraft industry”are distinguished by a special system of technique, economy andculture, and that they characterise a specific stage in the developmentof capitalism. 
 The important thing is that the majority of “industrialvillages” received the “smallest allotments” (39)—(in 1861, after their industrial life had proceeded for scores and in some cases hun-dreds of years!)—and of course, had there not been this connivance ofthe authorities there would have been no capitalism. 
 the West the manufacturing period of capitalism could not bring about the complete separation of the industrial work-ers from agriculture, * in Russia, with the preservation of many institutions that tie the peasants to the land, suchseparation could not but be retarded. 
 Therefore, we repeat,what is most typical of Russian capitalist manufactureis the non-agricultural centre which attracts the popula-tion of the surrounding villages—the inhabitants of which are semi-agriculturists and semi-industrialists—and dominates these villages. 
 Particularly noteworthy in this connection is the fact of the higher cultural level of the population of such non-agricultural centres. 
 A higher degree of literacy, a consid-erably higher standard of requirements and life, vigorous dissociation from the “rawness” of “native village soil”— such are the usual distinguishing features of the inhabitantsof such centres. 
 ** One can understand the enormous *Das Kapital , I2, 779-780. 
142 **The importance of this fact impels us to supplement the data given in §II with the following. 
 Buturlinovka settlement, BobrovUyezd, Voronezh Gubernia, is one of the centres of leather produc-tion. 
 There are 3,681 households, of which 2,383 do not engage in agriculture. 
 Population over 21,000. 
 Households with literate persons constitute 53%, as against 38% for the uyezd (Zemstvo statisticalreturns for Bobrov Uyezd). 
 Pokrovskaya settlement and Balakovovillage, Samara Gubernia, each have over 15,000 inhabitants, ofwhom very many are from outside. 
 Non-farming households—50%and 42%. 
 Literacy is above average. 
 The statistical materials state that the commercial and industrial villages in general are distinguished for their higher literacy and the “mass-scale appearance of non-farminghouseholds” (Zemstvo statistical returns for Novouzensk and Niko-layevsk uyezds).

 Kharizomenov,with his driver, a silk-weaver. 
 This weaver strongly and bitterlydeclaimed against the “drab” life of the peasants, the scantiness of their requirements, their backwardness, etc. 
, and wound up with the exclamation: “Good Lord, to think what these people live for!” Ithas long been observed that what the Russian peasant is poorest in isconsciousness of his own poverty. 
 Of the artisan in the capitalistmanufactory (not to mention the factory), it must be said that in this respect he is, comparatively speaking, very rich. 
 significance of this fact, which clearly demonstrates the pro-gressive historical role of capitalism, and moreover of purely “people’s” capitalism, which even the most ardent Narodnik would scarcely dare characterise as “artificial,”since the overwhelming majority of the centres describedare usually classified under the heading of “handicraft” indus-try! The transitional character of manufacture is revealedhere too, since it merely begins the transformation of the mentality of the population, and only large-scale machine industry completes it. 
 V. 
 THE ECONOMIC STRUCTURE OF MANUFACTURE In all the industries organised on the lines of manu-facture that we have examined, the vast mass of the workersare not independent, are subordinated to capital, and receive only wages, owning neither raw material nor finishedproduct. 
 At bottom, the overwhelming majority of the work-ers in these “industries” are wage-workers , although this relationship never achieves in manufacture the com-pleteness and purity characteristic of the factory. 
 In manu-facture, merchant’s capital is combined with industrial capital, is interwoven with it in the most diverse ways, and the dependence of the operative on the capitalistassumes a host of forms and shades, from work for hire in another person’s workshop, to work at home for a “mas-ter,” and finally to dependence in the purchase of rawmaterial or in the sale of the product. 
 Under manufacture, side by side with the mass of dependent workers, there always remains a more or less considerable number ofquasi-independent producers. 
 But all this diversity of forms of dependence merely covers up the main feature of manu-facture, the fact that the split between the representativesof labour and of capital is already manifested in full force. 
 By the time the emancipation of the peasants took place this split in the larger centres of Russian manufacture hadalready been sealed by a continuity of several generations. 
 In all the “industries” above examined we see a mass of people whose only means of livelihood is to work in a condi-tion of dependence upon members of the propertied class; on the other hand, we see a small minority of well-to-do industrialists who control (in one form or another) nearly the whole industry of the given district. 
 It is this fundamen-tal fact that imparts to our manufacture a pronouncedcapitalist character, as distinct from the preceding stage. 
Dependence on capital and work for hire existed then too, butit had not yet taken definite shape, had not yet embraced themass of industrialists, the mass of the population, had not given rise to a split among the various groups of individuals participating in production. 
 Moreover, production itself in thepreceding stage still preserves its small dimensions—thedifference between the master and the worker is relativelysmall—there are scarcely any big capitalists (who alwayshead manufacture)—nor are there any workers tied to a single operation and thereby tied to capital, which com-bines these detailed operations into a single mechanism of production. 
 Here is an old writer’s evidence which strikingly con-firms this characterisation of the data cited by us above: “In the village of Kimry, as in other so-called rich Rus-sian villages, Pavlovo, for example, half the populationare beggars who live entirely on alms. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 If an operative falls sick, and moreover lives alone, he risks going the next week without a crust of bread. 
” * Thus, the main feature of the economy of Russian manu-facture was already fully revealed by the 60s—the con-trast between the “wealth” of a whole number of “celebrated” “villages” and the complete proletarisation of the over-whelming majority of “handicraftsmen. 
” Connected with this feature is the circumstance that the most typical work-ers in manufacture (namely, artisans who have entirely or virtually broken with the land) are already gravitating towards the next, and not the preceding, stage of capitalism, that they stand closer to the worker in large-scale machine industry than to the peasant. 
 The above-quoted data on *N. 
 Ovsyannikov, “Relation of the Upper Volga Area to the Nizhni-Novgorod Fair. 
” Article in Nizhni-Novgorod Handbook , Vol. 
 II (Nizhni-Novgorod, 1869). 
 The author bases himself on data forKimry village for 1865. 
 This author supplements his review of the fair with a description of the social and economic relations in the industries represented there. 
 the cultural level of the handicraftsmen are striking proof of this. 
 But that description cannot be extended to the whole mass of the working personnel in manufacture. 
 The retention of a vast number of small establishments andsmall masters, the retention of connection with the landand the exceedingly extensive development of work in thehome—all this leads to large numbers of “handicraftsmen”in manufacture gravitating still towards the peasantry, towards becoming small masters, towards the past and not the future, * and clinging to all sorts of illusions about the possibility (by supreme exertion, by thrift and resource-fulness) of becoming independent masters. 
 ** Here is a remarkably fair appraisal of these petty-bourgeoisillusions given by an investigator of the “handicraft industries” of Vladimir Gubernia: “The final victory of large-scale industry over small industry, the bringing together of the workers, scattered in numerous workrooms, within the walls of a single silk mill, is only a matter of time, and the sooner this victory is achieved the better it will be for the weavers. 
 “Characteristic of the present organisation of the silk industry are the instability and indefiniteness of economic categories, the struggle between large-scale production, and small production andagriculture. 
 This struggle drags the small master and the weaver into fevers of excitement, yielding them nothing but divorcing them from the land, dragging them into debt and overwhelming them in periodsof depression. 
 Concentration of production will not reduce the weaver’s wages, but will make it unnecessary to entice workers and intox-icate them, to attract them with advances that do not correspondto their annual earnings. 
 With the diminution of mutual competition factory owners lose interest in expending considerable sums on in-volving the weaver in debt. 
 Moreover, large-scale production soclearly counterposes the interests of the factory owner and the workers, the wealth of the one and the poverty of the others, that the weaver cannot develop the desire to become a factory owner himself. 
 Smallproduction gives the weaver no more than large-scale production does, but it lacks the stability of the latter and for that reason cor-rupts the worker much more deeply. 
 False hopes arise in the mind ofthe handicraft weaver, he looks forward to the opportunity of setting up his own loom . 
 To achieve this ideal he strains himself to the ut-most, falls into debt, steals, lies, regards his fellow-weavers not as *Exactly like their Narodnik ideologists. 
 **For isolated heroes of individual endeavour (such as Duzhkin in V. 
 Korolenko’s Pavlovo Sketches ) this is still possible in the period of manufacture, but, of course, not for the mass of propertyless workers who perform a single operation. 
 friends in misfortune, but as enemies, as competitors for the very wretched loom that he sees in his mind’s eye in the remote future. 
 The small master does not understand his economic insignificance; he cringes to the buyers-up and the factory owners, hides from hisfellow-weavers where and on what terms he buys his raw materials and sells his product. 
 Imagining that he is an independent master, he becomes a voluntary and wretched tool, a plaything in the handsof the big traders. 
 No sooner does he succeed in dragging himself out of the mire, in acquiring three or four looms, than he begins to talk about the troubles of the employer, the laziness and drunkennessof the weavers, about the necessity of insuring the factory owner against non-payment of debts. 
 The small master is the incarnation of industrial servility, just as in the good old days the butler andthe housekeeper were the incarnation of serf servility. 
 So long as the instruments of production are not entirely divorced from the producer and the latter still has opportunities of becoming an inde-pendent master, so long as the economic gulf between the buyer-up and the weaver is bridged by proprietors, small masters and middle-men, who direct and exploit the lower economic categories and are subjectto the exploitation of the upper ones, the social consciousness of those who work is obscured and their imagination is distorted by fictions. 
 Competition arises where there should be solidarity, andthe interests of what are really antagonistic economic groups are united. 
 Not confining itself to economic exploitation, the present organisation of silk production finds its agents among the exploitedand lays upon them the task of obscuring the minds and corrupting the hearts of those who work” ( Industries of Vladimir Gubernia , Vol. 
 III, pp. 
 124-126). 
 VI. 
 MERCHANT’S AND INDUSTRIAL CAPITAL IN MANUFACTURE. 
 THE “BUYER-UP” AND THE “FACTORY OWNER” From the data given above it is evident that along with big capitalist workshops we always find an extremelylarge number of small establishments at this stage of cap-italist development; numerically, these, as a rule, even predominate, although they play a quite subordinate role in the sum-total of production. 
 This retention (and even, aswe have seen above, development) of small establishmentsunder manufacture is quite a natural phenomenon. 
 Underhand production, the large establishments have no decisiveadvantage over the small ones; division of labour, by creat-ing the simplest detailed operations, facilitates the rise of small workshops. 
 For this reason, a typical feature of cap-italist manufacture is precisely the small number of rela-tively large establishments side by side with a considerable number of small establishments. 
 Is there any connection between the one and the other? The data examined above leave no doubt that the connection between them is of the closest, that it is out of the small establishments that thelarge ones grow, that the small establishments are some-times merely outside departments of the manufactories, thatin the overwhelming majority of cases the connectionbetween them is maintained by merchant’s capital, which belongs to the big masters and holds sway over the small ones. 
 The owner of the big workshop has to buy raw materials and sell his wares on a large scale; the bigger his turnover,the smaller (per unit of product) are his expenses on the pur-chase and sale of goods, on sorting, warehousing, etc. 
, etc. 
;and so there arises the retail reselling of raw materials to small masters, and the purchase of their wares, which the manufactory owner resells as his own. 
 * If (as is often the case) bondage and usury are linked with these transactionsin the sale of raw materials and the purchase of wares,if the small master gets materials on credit and deliverswares in payment of debt, the big manufactory owner obtains a high level of profit on his capital such as he could never obtain from wage-workers. 
 Division of labour givesa fresh impetus to the development of such relations ofdependence of the small masters upon the big ones: the lat-ter either distribute materials in the homes for makingup (or for the performance of certain detailed operations), or buy up from the “handicraftsmen” parts of products, *Let us supplement the above by one other example. 
 In the furnishing industry of Moscow Gubernia (information dated 1876,from Mr. 
 Isayev’s book), the biggest industrialists are the Zenins,who introduced the making of costly furniture and “trained genera-tions of skilled artisans. 
” In 1845 they established a sawmill of their own (in 1894-95—12,000 rubles output, 14 workers, steam-engine). 
 Let us note that altogether in this industry there were 708 establish-ments, 1,979 workers, of whom 846, or 42. 
7%, were hired, and anoutput totalling 459,000 rubles. 
 In the beginning of the 60s theZenins began to buy raw materials wholesale in Nizhni-Novgorod. 
 Theybought timber in waggon-loads at 13 rubles per hundred planks and sold it to small handicraftsmen at 18-20 rubles. 
 In 7 villages (where 116 are at work) the majority sell furniture to Zenin, who has a fur-niture and plywood warehouse in Moscow (established in 1874) witha turnover reaching 40,000 rubles. 
 About 20 one-man jobbers areworking for the Zenins. 
 special sorts of products, etc. 
 In short, the closest and most inseparable tie between merchant’s and industrial capital i s one of the most characteristic features of manufacture. 
 The “buyer-up” nearly always merges here with the manu-factory owner (the “factory owner,” to use the current butwrong term, which classifies every workshop of any sizeas a “factory”). 
 That is why, in the overwhelming major-ity of cases, data on the scale of production of the big establishments in themselves give no idea of their real significance in our “handicraft industries,” * for the owners of such establishments have at their command the labour, notonly of the workers employed in their establishments, butof a mass of domestic workers, and even (de facto) of a massof quasi-independent small masters, in relation to whom they are buyers-up. 
” ** The data on Russian manufacture thus bring out in striking relief the law established by theauthor of Capital , namely, that the degree of development of merchant’s capital is inversely proportional to thedegree of development of industrial capital. 
 143 And indeed, we may characterise all the industries described in §II as follows: the fewer the big workshops in them, the more is “buying-up” developed, and vice versa; all that changesis the form of capital that dominates in each case and that *Here is an example illustrating what has been said above. 
 In the village of Negino, Trubchevsk Uyezd, Orel Gubernia, there is anoil works employing 8 workers, with an output of 2,000 rubles ( Direc-tory for 1890). 
 This small works would seem to indicate that the role of capital in the local oil-pressing industry is very slight But theslight development of industrial capital is merely indicative of anenormous development of merchant’s and usurer’s capital. 
 From theZemstvo statistical returns we learn of this village that of 186households 160 are completely in the grip of the local factory owner, who even pays all their taxes for them , lends them all they need (and that over many, many years), receiving help at a reduced price inpayment of debt. 
 The mass of the peasants in Orel Gubernia are in asimilar state of bondage. 
 Can one, under such circumstances, rejoiceover the slight development of industrial capital? **One can therefore imagine what sort of picture one gets of the economic organisation of such “handicraft industries” if the big manufactory owners are left out of account (after all, this is nothandicraft, but factory industry!), while the “buyers-up” are depicted asbeing “virtually quite superfluous and called into being solely bythe failure to organise the sale of products” (Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
, Essays on Handicraft Industry , 150)! places the “independent” handicraftsman in conditions which often are incomparably worse than those of the wage-worker. 
 The fundamental error of Narodnik economics is that it ignores, or glosses over, the connection between the bigand the small establishments, on the one hand, and betweenmerchant’s and industrial capital, on the other. 
 “The fac-tory owner of the Pavlovo area is nothing more than acomplex type of buyer-up,” says Mr. 
 Grigoryev (loc. 
 cit. 
, p. 
 119). 
 That is true, not only of Pavlovo, but of the majority of industries organised on the lines of capitalistmanufacture; the reverse is likewise true: the buyer-upin manufacture is a complex type of “factory owner”; this,incidentally, is one of the fundamental differences betweenthe buyer-up in manufacture and the buyer-up in the small peasant industries. 
 But to see in this fact of the connec-tion between the “buyer-up” and the “factory owner” someargument in favour of small industry (as Mr. 
 Grigoryevand many other Narodniks do) means drawing absolutelyarbitrary conclusions and distorting facts to fit precon-ceived notions. 
 A host of facts testify, as we have seen, to the point that the combination of merchant’s capital with industrial capital makes the position of the directproducer considerably worse than that of the wage-worker,lengthens his working day, reduces his earnings, andretards economic and cultural development. 
 VII. 
 CAPITALIST DOMESTIC INDUSTRY AS AN APPENDAGE OF MANUFACTURE Capitalist domestic industry—i. 
e. 
, the processing at home, for payment by the piece, of raw materials obtained from an entrepreneur—is also met with, as indicated in the preceding chapter, in the small peasant industries. 
 Later we shall see that it is met with again (and on a large scale) alongside the factory, i. 
e. 
, large-scale machine industry. 
 Thus, capitalist domestic industry is met with at all stages of the development of capitalism in industry, but is most characteristic of manufacture. 
 Both the small peasant industries and large-scale machine industry man-age very easily without domestic industry. 
 The manufactory period, however, of capitalist development, with its characteristic retention of the worker’s connection with the land, and with an abundance of small establishments around big ones—can be imagined with difficulty, or hardly atall, without the distribution of home work. 
 * And the facts of Russia do indeed show, as we have seen, that in theindustries organised on the lines of capitalist manufacturethe distribution of home work is particularly widespread. 
 That is why we think it most appropriate to examine in precisely this chapter the characteristic features of capi-talist domestic industry, although some of the examplesquoted below cannot be assigned specifically to manu-facture. 
 Let us point, first of all, to the multitude of middle-men between the capitalist and the worker in domestic industry. 
 The big entrepreneur cannot himself distributematerials to hundreds and thousands of workers, scatteredsometimes in different villages; what is needed is theappearance of middle-men (in some cases even of a hierarchyof middle-men) to take the materials in bulk and distribute them in small quantities. 
 We get a regular sweating system, ** a system of the severest exploitation: the “subcon-tractor” (or “workroom owner,” or “tradeswoman” in the laceindustry, etc. 
, etc. 
), who is close to the worker, knows howto take advantage even of specific cases of his distressand devises such methods of exploitation as would be inconceivable in a big establishment, and as absolutely preclude all possibility of control or supervision. 
 *** *In Western Europe also, as we know, the manufactory period of capitalism was distinguished by the extensive development ofdomestic industry—in the weaving industries for instance. 
 It isinteresting to note that in describing clock-making, which he cites asa classic example of manufacture, Marx points out that the dial, spring and case are rarely made in the manufactory itself, and that, in general, the detail worker often works at home ( Das Kapital , I, 2-te Aufl. 
, S. 
 353-354). 
 144 **These words are in English in the original. 
— Ed. 
 *** That, incidentally, is why the factory fights such middle-men, as, for example, the “jobbers,” workers who hire workmen on their own account. 
 Cf. 
 Kobelyatsky: Handbook for Factory Owners , etc. 
, St. 
 Petersburg, 1897, p. 
 24 and foll. 
 All the literature on the handi-craft industries teems with facts testifying to the extreme exploitation Alongside the sweating system, and perhaps as one of its forms, should be placed the truck system *—the system of payment in provisions—which is prohibited in factories, but continues to reign in handicraft industries, especiallywhere the work is distributed to homes. 
 Above, in describ-ing the various industries, instances were given of thiswidespread practice. 
 Further, capitalist domestic industry inevitably entails extremely insanitary working conditions. 
 The utter poverty of the worker, the utter impossibility of control-ling working conditions by regulations of any kind, and thecombination of the living and working premises, such arethe conditions that convert the dwellings of the homeworkers into hotbeds of infection and occupational disease. 
 In the large establishments one can fight such things; domestic industry, however, is in this respect the most“liberal” form of capitalist exploitation. 
 An excessively long working day is also an essential feature of domestic work for the capitalist and of the smallindustries in general. 
 Instances have been given illustrat-ing the comparative length of the working day in the “factories” and among the “handicraftsmen. 
” The drawing of women and of children of the tenderest age into production is nearly always observed in domesticindustry. 
 To illustrate this, let us cite some facts froma description of the women’s industries of Moscow Gubernia. 
 There are 10,004 women engaged in cotton winding; children start work at the age of 5 or 6 (!); daily earnings are 10kopeks, yearly 17 rubles. 
 The working day in the women’sindustries in general is as much as 18 hours. 
 In theknitting industry children start work from the age of six,daily earnings are 10 kopeks, yearly 22 rubles. 
 Altogether 37,514 females are employed in the women’s industries; they begin working from the age of 5 or 6 (in 6 out of 19 indus-tries, which 6 industries account for 32,400 female workers); of craftsmen by middle-men where work is distributed to homes. 
 Let us cite as an example Korsak’s general opinion, loc. 
 cit. 
, . 
p. 
 258,the description of “handicraft” weaving (quoted above), the descrip-tions of the women’s industries in Moscow Gubernia ( Statistical Returns for Moscow Gubernia , Vols. 
 VI and VII), and many others. 
 *These words are in English in the original. 
— Ed. 
 the average daily earnings are 13 kopeks, yearly 26 rubles 20 kopeks. 
 * One of the most pernicious aspects of capitalist domestic industry is that it leads to a reduction in the levelof the worker’s requirements. 
 The employer is able torecruit workers in remote districts where the popular stand-ard of living is particularly low and where the worker’sconnection with the land enables him to work for a bare pittance. 
 For example, the owner of a village stocking establishment explains that in Moscow rents are high andthat, besides, the knitters “have to be . 
 . 
 . 
 supplied withwhite bread . 
 . 
 . 
 whereas here the workers do the job intheir own cottages and eat black bread. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 Now how canMoscow compete with us!” ** In the cotton-winding indus-try the explanation of the very low wages is that for the peasants’ wives, daughters, etc. 
, this is merely a supple-mentary source of income. 
 “Thus, the system prevailing inthis trade forces down to the utmost limit the wages ofthose for whom it is the sole means of livelihood, reducesthe wages of those who obtain their livelihood exclusively by factory labour below their minimum needs, or retards the raising of their standard of living. 
 In both cases itcreates extremely abnormal conditions.

 Kharizomenov, “and itfinds them in their native villages, far from the centresof industry.

 That wages drop steadily as one moves from the industrial centres to the outer regions is an undoubted fact. 
” **** Hence, the employers are perfectly well able to take advantage of the conditions which artificially tie thepopulation to the rural districts. 
 The isolation of the home workers is a no less pernicious aspect of this system. 
 Here is a graphic description of this aspect of the matter, as given by buyers-up *Mme. 
 Gorbunova, who has described the women’s industries, wrongly gives the earnings as 18 kopeks and 37 rubles 77 kopeks respectively, for she takes only the average figures for each industryand leaves out of account the different numbers of women workingin the different industries.

 themselves: “The operations of both” (the small and the big buyers-up of nails from the Tver blacksmiths) “are organised according to one system—when they collect the nails, they pay partly in money and partly in iron, andto make the blacksmiths more tractable always have them working in their homes. 
” * These words provide a simple clue to the “vitality” of our “handicraft” industry! The isolation of the home workers and the abundance of middle-men naturally lead to widespread bondage, to all kinds of personal dependence, which usually accompany“patriarchal” relationships in remote rural districts. 
 Work-ers’ indebtedness to employers is extremely widespreadin the “handicraft” industries in general, and in domesticindustry in particular. 
 ** Usually the worker is not only a Lohnsklave but also a Schuldsklave. 
 *** Instances were given above of the conditions in which the worker is placed bythe “patriarchal character” of rural relationships. 
 **** Passing from the description of capitalist domestic industry to the conditions making for its spread, we mustfirst make mention of the connection between this system and the tying of the peasant to his allotment. 
 The lack of freedom of movement, the necessity of occasionally suffer-ing monetary loss in order to get rid of land (when pay-ments for the land exceed returns from it, so that a peas-ant who leases his allotment finds himself paying a sum tothe lessee), the social-estate exclusiveness of the peasant community—all this artificially enlarges the sphere of *Reports and Investigations , 1, 218.

 **** “Of course,” we read of the blacksmiths of Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia, “here, too, the master exploits the worker’s labour, but toa lesser degree (?), and moreover it is done patriarchally, as it were, by common consent (!) without any misunderstandings” ( Transactions of the Handicraft Commission , IV, 199). 
 application of capitalist home-work, artificially binds the peasant to these worst forms of exploitation. 
 Obsolete institutions and an agrarian system that is thoroughly saturated with the social-estate principle thus exert a mostpernicious influence in both agriculture and industry,perpetuating technically backward forms of production whichgo hand in hand with the greatest development of bondageand personal dependence, with the hardest lot and the most helpless position of the working people. 
 * Furthermore, there is also an undoubted connection between home-work for capitalists and the differentiation ofthe peasantry. 
 Extensive incidence of home-work presup-poses two conditions: 1) the existence of a mass of ruralproletarians who have to sell their labour-power, and to sell it cheaply; 2) the existence of well-to-do peasants, well acquainted with local conditions, who can undertake thefunction of agents in distributing work. 
 A salesman sent inby the merchant will not always be able to fulfil this function (particularly in the more or less complex industries)and will hardly ever be able to fulfil it with such “virtu-osity” as can a local peasant, “one of themselves. 
” ** The big entrepreneurs would probably be unable to carry outhalf their operations in distributing work to home workersif they did not have at their command a whole army ofsmall entrepreneurs who can be trusted with goods oncredit or on commission, and who greedily clutch at everyopportunity of enlarging their small commercial operations. 
 Finally, it is extremely important to point to the signifi-cance of capitalist domestic industry in the theory of the *Of course, in all capitalist society there will always be a rural proletariat that agrees to take home-work on the worst terms; but obsolete institutions enlarge the sphere of application of domestic industry and hinder the struggle against it. 
 Korsak, as far back as1861, pointed to the connection between the tremendously widespreadnature of domestic industry in Russia and our agrarian system (loc. 
cit. 
, 305-307). 
 **We have seen that the big master-industrialists, the buyers-up, workroom owners and subcontractors are at the same time well-to-do agriculturists. 
 “The subcontractor,” we read, for example, ina description of galloon-weaving in Moscow Gubernia ( Statistical Returns for Moscow Gubernia , Vol. 
 VI, Pt. 
 II, p. 
 147), “is a peasant just like his weaver, but has a cottage, a horse and a cow more thanthe weaver has, and perhaps is able with his whole family to drink surplus-population created by capitalism. 
 No one has talked so much about the “freeing” of the Russian workers by capitalism as have Messrs. 
 V. 
 V. 
, N. 
 —on and other Narodniks, but none of them has taken the trouble toanalyse the specific forms of the “reserve army” of labour thathave arisen and are arising in Russia in the post-Reformperiod. 
 None of the Narodniks has even noticed the triflingdetail that home workers constitute what is, perhaps, the largest section of our “reserve army” of capitalism. 
 * B y distributing work to be done in the home the entrepreneursare enabled to increase production immediately to thedesired dimensions without any considerable expenditure ofcapital and time on setting up workshops, etc. 
 Such animmediate expansion of production is very often dictated by the conditions of the market, when increased demand results from a livening up of some large branch of industry(e. 
g. 
, railway construction), or from such circumstancesas war, etc. 
 ** Hence, another aspect of the process which *This error of the Narodniks is all the more gross in that the majority of them want to follow the theory of Marx, who most emphatically stressed the capitalist character of “modern domestic industry” and pointed especially to the fact that these home workers constitute one of the forms of the relative surplus-population charac-teristic of capitalism .

 In Moscow Gubernia, the tailoring industry is widespread (Zemstvo statistics counted in the gubernia at the end of the 1870s a total of 1,123 tailors working locally and 4,291working away from home); most of the tailors worked for the Moscow ready-made clothing merchants. 
 The centre of the industry is the Perkhushkovo Volost, Zvenigorod Uyezd (see data on the Perkhush-kovo tailors in Appendix I to Chapter V, Industry No. 
 36). 
 The Per-khushkovo tailors did particularly well during the war of 1877. 
 Theymade army tents to the order of special contractors; subcon-tractors with 3 sewing-machines and ten women day workers “made”from 5 to 6 rubles a day. 
 The women were paid 20 kopeks per day. 
“It is said that in those busy days over 300 women day workers from various surrounding villages lived in Shadrino (the principal village in the Perkhushkovo Volost)” ( Statistical Returns for Moscow Gubernia , Vol. 
 VI, Pt. 
 II, loc. 
 cit. 
, 256). 
 “At that time the Perkhushkovo tailors,that is, the owners of the workshops, made so much money thatnearly all of them built themselves fine homes” (ibid. 
). 
 These hundredsof women day workers who, perhaps, would have a busy season once in 5 to 10 years, must always be available, in the ranks of the reserve we described in Chapter II as the formation of an agricul-tural proletariat of millions, is, incidentally, the enormous development in the post-Reform period of capitalist domestic industry. 
 “What has become of the hands releasedfrom the occupations of domestic, strictly natural economy,which had in view the family and the few consumers inthe neighbouring market? The factories overcrowded withworkers, the rapid expansion of large-scale domestic industry provide a clear answer” ( Industries of Vladimir Gubernia , III, 20.

 The figures given in the following sectionwill show how great the number of workers employed byentrepreneurs in domestic industry must be in Russiatoday. 
 VIII. 
 WHAT IS “HANDICRAFT” INDUSTRY? In the two preceding chapters we dealt mainly with what in Russia is usually called “handicraft” industry; wemay now try to answer the question put in the heading. 
 Let us begin with some statistics, so as to judge which of the forms of industry analysed above figure in publica-tions among the general mass of “handicraft industries. 
” The Moscow statisticians, in concluding their investi-gation of the peasant “industries,” summarised all and sundry non-agricultural occupations. 
 They listed altogether 141,329 persons (Vol. 
 VII, Pt. 
 III) engaged in local industries (in the making of commodities), but among these were included artisans (a section of the shoe-makers, gla-ziers and many others), wood sawyers, etc. 
, etc. 
 Not fewerthan 87,000 (according to our calculations of the differentindustries) were domestic workers employed by capital-ists. 
 * The number of wage-workers in the 54 industries for which we have been able to combine the data is 17,566, out of 29,446, i. 
e. 
, 59. 
65%. 
 For Vladimir Gubernia wehave obtained the following results (from five issues ofIndustries of Vladimir Gubernia ): altogether, 18,286 engaged in 31 industries; of these 15,447 were engaged in *Let us recall that Mr. 
 Kharizomenov (article quoted above) calculated that of 102,245 persons engaged in 42 industries of MoscowGubernia, 66% were engaged in industries where there was an abso-lute predominance of the domestic system of large-scale production. 
 industries in which capitalist domestic industry predominates (including 5,504 wage-workers, i. 
e. 
, hirelings of the sec-ond degree, so to speak). 
 Further, there are 150 rural arti-sans (of whom 45 are hired) and 2,689 small commodity-producers (of whom 511 are hired). 
 The total number ofcapitalistically engaged workers is (15,447 #45#511 =) 16,003, i. 
e. 
, 87. 
5%. 
 * In Kostroma Gubernia (on the basis of Mr. 
 Tillo’s tables in the Transactions of the Handicraft Commission ), there are 83,633 local industrialists, of whom 19,701 are lumber-workers (fine “handicraftsmen”!), while29,564 work in their homes for capitalists; some 19,954 areengaged in industries in which small commodity-producerspredominate, and some 14,414 are village artisans. 
 ** In 9 uyezds of Vyatka Gubernia there are (according to the same Transactions ) 60,019 local industrialists; of these, 9,672 are millers and oil-pressers; 2,032 arepure artisans (engaged in fabric-dyeing); 14,928 are partlyartisans and partly commodity-producers, the overwhelmingmajority working independently; 14,424 engage in industriespartly subordinated to capital; 14,875 engage in industries entirely subordinated to capital; 4,088 engage in industries in which wage-labour completely predominates. 
 ** On the basis of the data in the Transactions regarding the other gubernias we have compiled a table of those industries on *Unfortunately, we are unable to acquaint ourselves with the latest work on handicraft industry in Yaroslavl Gubernia ( Handi-craft Industries . 
 Published by Statistical Bureau of Yaroslavl Gubernia Zemstvo. 
 Yaroslavl, 1904). 
 Judging from the detailed review in Russkiye Vedomosti (1904, No. 
 248), it is an extremely valuable piece of research. 
 The number of handicraftsmen in the gubernia isestimated as 18,000 (the number of factory workers in 1903 wasplaced at 33,898). 
 Industries are on the decline. 
 One-fifth of the enter-prises employ wage-workers. 
 One quarter of the total number ofhandicraftsmen are wage-workers. 
 Of the total number of handi-craftsmen 15% are engaged in establishments with 5 and more workers. 
 Exactly one half of all the handicraftsmen work for masters, withmaterials supplied by the latter. 
 Agriculture is on the decline; one-sixth of the handicraftsmen have neither horses nor cows, one-thirdcultivate by hiring a neighbour; one-fifth have no land under crops. 
The earnings of a handicraftsman are 1 2, rubles a week! ( Note to 2nd edition . 
) **All these figures are approximate, for the source does not give precise figures. 
 Among the village artisans are included millers, black-smiths, etc. 
, etc. 
 the organisation of which more or less detailed information is available. 
 We get 97 industries employing 107,957 persons, with an output totalling 21,151,000 rubles. 
 Of these, industries in which wage-labour and capitalist domesticindustry predominate employ 70,204 persons (18,621,000 rub-les); industries in which wage-workers and workers occupiedat home for capitalists constitute only a minority employ26,935 persons (1,706,000 rubles); and, finally, industries in which independent labour almost completely predomi-nates employ 10,818 persons (824,000 rubles). 
 According toZemstvo statistical materials regarding 7 industries ofGorbatov and Semyonov uyezds of Nizhni-NovgorodGubernia, there are 16,303 handicraftsmen, of whom 4,614work for the local market; 8,520 work “for a master,” and 3,169 as wage-workers; in other words, 11,689 are capitalis-tically employed workers. 
 According to the returns of the1894-95 Perm handicraft census, of 26,000 handicraftsmen,6,500 (25%) are wage-workers, and 5,200 (20%) work forbuyers-up, in other words, 45% are capitalistically employedworkers. 
 * Fragmentary as the data are (no others were available), they nevertheless clearly show that, taken as a whole, a mass of capitalistically employed workers are classified among the “handicraftsmen. 
” For instance, those workingat home for capitalists number (according to the above-quoteddata) over 200,000 . 
 And this is for some 50 or 60 uyezds, by no means all of which have been investigated thoroughly. 
 For the whole of Russia the number of workers of this typemust be something like two million. 
 ** If to these are added *See Studies , pp. 
 181-182.

 2, The Handicraft Census of 1894-95 in Perm Gubernia .

) **For example, capitalist work in the home is particularly developed in the ready-made clothing industry, which is growingrapidly. 
 “The demand for such an article of prime necessity as ready-made clothing is increasing from year to year” ( Vestnik Finansov , 1897 No. 
 52, Survey of Nizhni-Novgorod Fair). 
 The enormous development of this industry has taken place only since the 80s. 
 At the present time, in Moscow alone ready-made clothing is producedto a total value of not less than 16 million rubles, with some 20,000workers employed. 
 It is estimated that for the whole of Russia the /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR the wage-workers employed by “handicraftsmen”—and, as may be seen from the above-quoted figures, their number is by no means as small as is sometimes thought here in Russia—we shall have to concede that the figure of 2 millionindustrial workers capitalistically employed outside theso-called “factories and works” is, if anything, a minimumfigure. 
 * To the question—“What is handicraft industry?”—the data quoted in the last two chapters compel us to give the answer that the term used is absolutely unsuitable forpurposes of scientific investigation, and is one usuallyemployed to cover all and sundry forms of industry, fromdomestic industries and handicrafts to wage-labour in verylarge manufactories. 
 ** This lumping together of the most diverse types of economic organisation, which prevails in a host of descriptions of “handicraft industries,” *** was output reaches the sum of 100 million rubles ( Successes of Russian Industry According to Surveys of Expert Commissions , St. 
 Petersburg, 1897, pp. 
 136-137). 
 In St. 
 Petersburg, the 1890 census gave the number employed in ready-made clothing (Group XI, Classes 116-118) as 39,912, counting members of industrialists families, including 19,000workers, and 13,000 one-man producers with their families ( St. 
 Petersburg According to the Census of December 15 , 1890 ). 
 The 1897 census shows that the total number of persons employed in the clothingindustry in Russia was 1,158,865, the members of their families num-bering 1,621,511; total 2,780,376. 
 ( Note to 2nd edition . 
) *Let us recall that the number of “handicraftsmen” in Russia is estimated at no less than 4 million (Mr. 
 Kharizomenov’s figureMr. 
 Andreyev gave the figure of 7 2 million, but his methods are too sweeping)147; consequently, the total figures given in the text cover about one-tenth of the total number of “handicraftsmen. 
” **Cf. 
 Studies , p. 
 179 and foll. 
 (See present edition, Vol, 2, The Handicraft Census of 1894-95 in Perm Gubernia . 
—Ed. 
) *** The desire to retain the term “handicraftsmanship” for the purpose of scientifically defining forms of industry has led in our publications to purely scholastic arguments about, and definitionsof, this “handicraftsmanship. 
” One economist “understood” handi-craftsmen to mean only commodity-producers, while another included artisans in this term; one considered connection with the land asan essential feature, while another allowed for exceptions; oneexcluded wage-labour, while another allowed for it where, for example,there were up to 16 workers, etc. 
, etc. 
 It goes without saying thatarguments of this sort (instead of investigation of the different forms of industry) could lead nowhere. 
 Let us observe that the tenacity of the special term “handicraftsmanship” is to be explained most of taken over quite uncritically and quite senselessly by the Narodnik economists, who made a tremendous step backward by comparison, for example, with a writer like Korsak, and availed themselves of the prevailing confusion of terms toevolve the most curious theories. 
 “Handicraft industry” wasregarded as something economically homogeneous, some-thing sufficient unto itself, and was “ counterposed ” (sic!) to “capitalism,” which without further ado was taken to mean “factory” industry. 
 Let us take Mr. 
 N. 
 —on, for instance. 
 On p. 
 79 of his Sketches we find the heading “Capita-lisation (?) of Industries,” * and then, without any reserva-tion or explanation, “Data on Factories. 
”. 
 . 
 . 
 The simplicityis positively touching: “capitalism”=“factory industry, ” and factory industry =what is classified under this heading in official publications. 
 And on the basis of such a profound “analysis” the masses of capitalistically employed workersincluded among the “handicraftsmen” are wiped off capital-ism’s account. 
 On the basis of this sort of “analysis” the ques-tion of the different forms of industry in Russia is completelyevaded. 
 On the basis of this sort of “analysis” one of the most absurd and pernicious prejudices is built up concerning the distinction between our “handicraft” industry and our “fac-tory” industry, the divorcement of the latter from theformer, the “artificial character” of “factory” industry, etc. 
It is a prejudice because no one has ever so much asattempted to examine the data, which in all branches of man” is an industrialist belonging to the lower estates, a person who may be patronised and in relation to whom schemes may be concoctedwithout compunction; the form of industry is left out of account. 
The merchant, however and the member of the nobility (even thoughthey be small industrialists) are rarely classified as “handicraftsmen. 
” By “handicraft” industries are usually meant all sorts of peasant , and only peasant, industries. 
 *This term “capitalisation,” of which Messrs. 
 V. 
 V. 
 and N. 
 —on are so fond, is permissible in a newspaper article, for the sakeof brevity, but it is totally out of place in an economic investigationof which the whole purpose is to analyse the various forms and stages of capitalism, their significance, their connection, and their consecu-tive development. 
 “Capitalisation” may be taken to mean anythingin the world: the hiring of a single “labourer,” buying-up, and a steam-driven factory. 
 How can one make head or tail of it, with all thesethings jumbled together! industry show a very close and inseparable connection between “handicraft” industry and “factory” industry. 
 The object of this chapter has been to show in what pre-cisely this connection consists and precisely which specifictechnical, economic and cultural features are representedby the form of industry that in Russia stands betweensmall-scale industry and large-scale machine industry. 
 C H A P T E R VII THE DEVELOPMENT OF LARGE-SCALE MACHINE INDUSTRY I. 
 THE SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTION OF THE FACTORY AND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF “FACTORY” STATISTICS148 Before dealing with large-scale machine (factory) industry, we must first establish the fact that the scientific conception of the term does not correspond at all to its common, everyday meaning. 
 In our official statistics, andin literature generally, a factory is taken to mean any moreor less big industrial establishment with a more or lessconsiderable number of wage-workers. 
 According to Marx’stheory, however, the term large-scale machine (factory) industry applies only to a definite stage of capitalism in industry, namely, the highest stage. 
 The principal andmost important feature of this stage is the employment of asystem of machines for production. 
 * The transition from the manufactory to the factory signifies a complete tech-nical revolution, which does away with the craftsman’s manual skill that has taken centuries to acquire, and this technical revolution is inevitably followed by the mostthoroughgoing destruction of social production relations,by a final split among the various groups of participantsin production, by a complete break with tradition, by anintensification and extension of all the dark aspects of capitalism, and at the same time by a mass socialisation of labour by capitalism. 
 Large-scale machine industry isthus the last word of capitalism, the last word of its“elements of social progress” ** and regress. 
 From this it is clear that the transition from the man-ufactory to the factory is particularly important when we *Das Kapital , I, Chapter 13 [Chap. 
 15, Eng. 
 ed. 
— Ed. 
]. 
 **Ibid. 
, I2, S. 
 499. 
149 deal with the development of capitalism. 
 Whoever confuses these two stages deprives himself of the possibility of understanding the transforming, progressive role of cap-italism. 
 That is the mistake made by our Narodnik econo-mists, who, as we have seen, naïvely identify capitalismgenerally with “factory” industry and propose to solve theproblem of the “mission of capitalism” and even of its “uni-fying significance” * by simply referring to factory statistics. 
 Apart from the fact that on matters of factory statistics these writers (as we shall show in detail below) havebetrayed astonishing ignorance, they commit a still gravererror in their amazingly stereotyped and narrow understand-ing of Marx’s theory. 
 In the first place, it is ridiculousto reduce the problem of the development of large-scale machine industry to mere factory statistics. 
 It is a ques-tion not only of statistics, but of the forms assumed andthe stages traversed by the development of capitalismin the industry of the country under consideration. 
 Onlyafter the substance of these forms and their distinguish-ing features have been made clear is there any sense in illustrating the development of this or that form by means of properly compiled statistics. 
 If, however, theyrestrict themselves to Russian statistics, this inevitablyleads to lumping together the most diverse forms of capi-talism, to not seeing the wood for the trees. 
 Secondly,to reduce the whole mission of capitalism to that of increasing the number of “factory” workers means to betray as profound an understanding of theory as didMr. 
 Mikhailovsky when he expressed surprise as to whypeople talk about the socialisation of labour by capitalism,when all that this socialisation amounts to, he averred,is that several hundred or thousand workers saw, chop, cut, plane, etc. 
, under one roof. 
 ** The task of our further exposition is twofold: on the one hand, we shall examine in detail the condition of ourfactory statistics and the question of their suitability.

 On the other hand, we shall examine the data attesting to the growth of large-scale machine industry in the post-Reform period. 
 II. 
 OUR FACTORY STATISTICS The main source of factory statistics in Russia is the returns supplied annually by owners of factories and worksto the Department of Commerce and Manufacture, in con-formity with the law passed at the very beginning of thepresent century. 
 * The very detailed regulations in this law concerning the submission of information by factory owners are nothing but a pious wish, and to this day the factory statistics are organised on the old, purely pre-Reform lines and are simply appendices to gubernatorialreports. 
 There is no precise definition of the term “factory-and-works,” and consequently gubernia and even uyezdauthorities employ it in the most diverse ways. 
 There is no central body to direct the proper and uniform collection, and verification, of returns. 
 The distribution ofindustrial establishments among various departments(Mining, Department of Commerce and Manufacture,Miscellaneous Taxes Department, etc. 
) still furtherincreases the confusion. 
 ** In Appendix II we cite the data on our factory industry in the post-Reform period that are to be found in officialpublications, namely, for the years of 1863-1879 and 1885-1891. 
 These data relate only to trades not subject to ex-cise duty; moreover, for different periods informationis given for a different number of trades (the returns for *For a detailed review of the sources of our factory statistics, see in Statistical Chronicle of the Russian Empire , Series II, Vol.

 (See present edition, Vol. 
 4. 
— Ed. 
) 1864-1865 and for 1885 and subsequent years being the fullest); that is why we have singled out 34 trades for which data are available for 1864-1879 and 1885-1890, i. 
e. 
, for 22 years. 
 To judge the value of these data, letus first examine the most important publications on ourfactory statistics. 
 Let us begin with the 60s. 
 The compilers of factory statistics in the 60s fully appre-ciated the extremely unsatisfactory nature of the returns they were handling. 
 In their unanimous opinion the number of workers and the total output were considerablyunderstated in the factory-owners’ reports; “there is nouniform definition, even for the different gubernias, ofwhat should be regarded as a factory and a works, sincemany gubernias include among the factories and works, for example, windmills, brick-making sheds and small industrial establishments, while others take no accountof them, with the result that even comparative data onthe total numbers of factories and works in the differentgubernias are valueless. 
” * Still more trenchant is the criti-cism by Bushen, Bok and Timiryazev, ** who, in addition, point to the inclusion of those occupied at home among the factory workers, to the fact that some factory owners supplyreturns only for workers who live on the factory premises,etc. 
 “There are no correct official statistics on manufactoryand factory industry,” says Mr. 
 Bushen, “and there will benone until there is a change in the main principles on which the primary material is gathered. 
” *** “The tables of facto-ries and works for many trades include, evidently by misun-derstanding, numerous purely artisan and handicraft estab-lishments that possess nothing of the character of a factory orworks. 
” **** In view of this, the editors of the Yearbook refused even to summarise the data printed, “not desiring to pass on to the public incorrect and obviously exaggerated figures. 
” **** To give the reader a precise idea of the extent *P.

 of this obvious exaggeration, let us turn to the data given in the Yearbook , which differs to advantage from all other sources, in that it contains a list of factories with an out-put exceeding 1,000 rubles. 
 At the present time (since1885), establishments with a smaller total output are notcounted as factories. 
 An estimate of these small establish-ments according to the Yearbook reveals that 2,366 were included in the general list of factories, employing 7,327 workers and an output amounting to 987,000 rubles. 
 The total number of factories, however, in 71 trades, accord-ing to the Yearbook , was 6,891, with 342,473 workers and an output totalling 276,211,000 rubles. 
 Consequently,the small establishments represent 34. 
3% of the totalnumber of establishments, 2. 
1% of the total number of workers, and 0. 
3% of the total output. 
 It stands to reason that it is absurd to regard such small establishments (withan average per establishment of a little over 3 workersand less than 500 rubles output) as factories, and thatthere can be no question of there being anything like a com-plete registration of them. 
 Not only have such establish-ments been classed as factories in our statistics, but there have even been cases of hundreds of handicraftsmen beingquite artificially and arbitrarily combined as a “factory. 
”For example, this very Yearbook mentions in the rope-mak-ing trade of the Izbylets Volost, Gorbatov Uyezd, Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia, a factory “of the peasants of the Izbylets Volost; 929 workers; 308 spinning wheels; output 100,400 rubles” (p. 
 149); or in the village of Vorsma in thesame uyezd, a factory of “temporarily bound peasants ofCount Sheremetev; 100 smithies; 250 carpenters’ benches(in homes); 3 horse-operated and 20 hand-operated grind-stones; 902 workers; output 6,610 rubles” (p. 
 281). 
 One can imagine what an idea of the real situation such statistics give! * *As to understatements by factory owners in their returns regarding the number of employed workers and the output, the above-mentioned sources make two interesting attempts at verification. 
Timiryazev compared the returns made by over a hundred big factoryowners for the official statistics with the returns they made for the1865 Exhibition. 
 The latter figures proved to be 22% higher than the former (loc. 
 cit. 
, I, pp. 
 IV-V). 
 In 1868 the Central Statistical A special place among the sources of factory statistics of the 60s is held by the Military Statistical Abstract (Vol. 
 IV. 
 Russia, St. 
 Petersburg, 1871). 
 It gives data on all the factories and works of the Russian Empire, includ-ing mining and excise-paying establishments, and estimatesthat in 1866 there were in European Russia no morenor less than 70,631 factories, 829,573 workers, with anoutput totalling 583,317,000 rubles!! These curious figures were arrived at, firstly, because they were taken, not from the reports of the Ministry of Finance, but from thespecial returns of the Central Statistical Committee (thesereturns were never published in any of the Committee’spublications, nor is it known by whom, how and when theywere gathered and processed); * secondly, because the com-pilers of the Military Statistical Abstract did not hesitate in the least to class even the smallest establishments asfactories. 
 ( Military Statistical Abstract , p. 
 319) and further-more supplemented the basic returns with other material:returns of the Department of Commerce and Manufacture,returns of the Commissariat, returns of the Ordnance and Naval Departments, and finally, returns “from the most diverse sources” (ibid. 
, p. 
 XXIII). 
 ** Therefore, in using Committee, as an experiment, instituted a special investigation of factory industry in Moscow and Vladimir gubernias (where in 1868nearly half of all the workers and of the total output of the factories andworks of European Russia were concentrated). 
 If we take the tradesfor which data are given both by the Ministry of Finance and the CentralStatistical Committee, we get the following figures: according to the Ministry of Finance there were 1,749 factories, 186,521 workers, with an output totalling 131,568,000 rubles, whereas according tothe investigation by the Central Statistical Committee there were 1,704factories, 196,315 workers on premises plus 33,485 outside workers,and an output totalling 137,758,000 rubles. 
 *It is very possible that these returns were simply taken from gubernatorial reports, which, as we shall see below, always enormously **How widely the Military Statistical Abstract applied the term “factory” becomes particularly evident through the following: theYearbook statistics are called “the statistics of our large establish-ments” (p. 
 319, authors’ italics). 
 As we have seen, 3, of these “large” establishments have an output of less than 1,000 rubles!! We omitmore detailed proof of the point that the figures given in the Military Statistical Abstract must not be used for purposes of comparison with present-day factory statistics, since this task has already beenexaggerate the number of factories and works. 
 the data of the Military Statistical Abstract for purposes of comparison with present-day data, Messrs. 
 N. 
 —on, * Karyshev ** and Kablukov *** revealed their total unfamiliarity with the principal sources of our factorystatistics and their utterly uncritical attitude towardsthese statistics. 
 During the debate in the Free Economic Society on the paper read by M. 
 I. 
 Tugan-Baranovsky, who pointed to the completely erroneous character of the figures in the Mili-tary Statistical Abstract , several speakers declared that even if there was an error in the number of workers, it wasonly a slight one—10 to 15%. 
 That was said, for example,by Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
 (see verbatim report of debate, St. 
 Petersburg,1898, p. 
 1). 
 He was “joined” by Mr. 
 V. 
 Pokrovsky, who also confined himself to a bald statement (p. 
 3). 
 Without even attempting a critical examination of the various sourcesof our factory statistics, these people and their supporterscontented themselves with generalities about the unsatisfac-tory nature of factory statistics, and about the data havingrecently become more exact (??) and so forth. 
 The main issue, the crude error of Messrs. 
 N. 
 —on and Karyshev, was thus simply glossed over , as P. 
 B. 
 Struve quite rightly observed (p. 
 11). 
 We therefore think it worth while to calculate thoseexaggerations in the data of the Military Statistical Abstract which could and should have been noticed by anybody handling the sources attentively. 
 For 71 trades we have the parallel statistics for 1866 both of the Ministry of Finance ( Ministry of Finance Yearbook , I) and of unknown origin ( Military Statistical Abstract ). 
 For these trades, leaving out the metallurgical, the Military Statistical Abstract exaggerated the number of workers employed in factories and works in European Russia by 50,000 . 
 Further, for those trades for which the Yearbook gave only gross figures for the Empire, refusing to analyse them in detail performed by Mr. 
 Tugan-Baranovsky (see his book The Factory , etc.

 336 and foll.

 in view of their “obvious exaggeration” ( Yearbook , p. 
 306), the Military Statistical Abstract gives 95,000 workers over and above these figures. 
 In brick-making the num-ber of workers is exaggerated by a minimum of 10 ,000; to convince oneself of this, one should compare the data bygubernias given in the Military Statistical Abstract and those in Returns and Material of the Ministry of Finance , No. 
 4 of 1866 and No. 
 6 of 1867. 
 For the metallurgical trades the Military Statistical Abstract exaggerated the number of workers by 86 ,000 as compared with that in the Year-book , having evidently included some of the mine workers in its figure. 
 For the excise-paying trades the Military Statistical Abstract , as we shall show in the next section, exaggerates the number of workers by nearly 40 ,000. 
 Altogether there is an exaggeration of 280,000. 
 This is a mini-mum and incomplete figure, for we lack material to verify the data of the Military Statistical Abstract f or all trades. 
 One can therefore judge to what extent those who assertthat the error of Messrs. 
 N. 
 —on and Karyshev is trifling are informed on this subject! In the 1870s much less was done to combine and analyse factory statistics than in the 1860s. 
 The Ministry of Finance Yearbook contains data for only 40 trades (not subject to excise duty) for 1867-1879 (Vols. 
 VIII, X andXII; see Appendix II), the exclusion of the other tradesbeing ascribed to the “extremely unsatisfactory nature of the material” for industries “which are connected with agricultural life, or are appendages of artisan and handi-craft industries” (Vol. 
 VIII, p. 
 482; same, Vol. 
 X, p. 
 590). 
The most valuable source for the 1870s is Mr. 
 P. 
 Orlov’sDirectory of Factories and Works (1st edition, St. 
 Peters-burg, 1881, returns for 1879 taken from the same reports of factory owners to the Department of Commerce and Manufacture). 
 This publication lists all establishmentswith an output of not less than 2,000 rubles. 
 The others,being small and inseparable from handicraft establish-ments, are not enumerated in this list, but are included in the summarised data given by the Directory . 
 Since no separate totals are given for establishments with an output of 2,000 rubles and over, the general data of the Directory , like those of previous publications, combine the small establishments with the large ones; for different trades and different gubernias unequal numbers of small establish-ments are included (quite fortuitously, of course) in the statistics. 
 * Regarding trades connected with agriculture, the Directory repeats (p. 
 396) the Yearbook ’s reservation and refuses to give “ even approximate totals” (author’s italics) owing to the inaccuracy and incompleteness ofthe data. 
 ** This view (quite a legitimate one, as we shall see below) did not, however, prevent the inclusion in the Directory ’s general totals of all these particularly unreliable figures, which are thus lumped together withrelatively reliable ones. 
 Let us give the Directory ’s total figures for European Russia, with the observation that,unlike previous figures, they also embrace excise-paying trades (the second edition of the Directory , 1887, gives the returns for 1884; the third, 1894, those for 1890): No.

 Thus,the number of establishments with an output exceeding 1,000 rubles was estimated in 1884 at 19,277, and in 1890, at 21,124; with an output of 2,000 rubles and over: in 1884at 11,509, and in 1890 at 17,642. 
 **** *Examples will be given in the next section. 
 Here let us refer to p. 
 679 and foll. 
 of the Directory ; a glance at these pages will readily convince anyone of the justice of what has been said in the text. 
 **In the third edition of the Directory (St. 
 Petersburg, 1894), this reservation is not repeated, regrettably so, for the data are asunsatisfactory as ever. 
 *** Certain missing data have been added approximately; see Directory , p. 
 695. 
 **** See classification of factories according to total output in the second and third editions of the Directory . 
 In 1889 the Department of Commerce and Manufactures began to issue in separate editions Collections of Data on Factory Industry in Russia (for 1885 and subsequent years). 
 These data are based on the material mentioned(factory owners’ reports), and their treatment is far fromsatisfactory, being inferior to that in the above-mentionedpublications of the 60s. 
 The only improvement is thatthe small establishments, i. 
e. 
, those with an output of under 1,000 rubles, are not included among the factories and works, and information regarding them is givenseparately, without their being distributed according totrades. 
 * This, of course, is a totally inadequate criterion of what a “factory” is; a complete registration of establish-ments with an output exceeding 1,000 rubles is out of the question under the present system of gathering information; the separation of “factories” in trades connected with agri-culture is done quite haphazardly—for instance, for somegubernias and in some years watermills and windmillsare classed as factories, while in others they are not. 
 ** The author of the section “Chief Results of Factory Indus-try in Russia for 1885-1887” (in the Collections for these years) falls repeatedly into error in disregarding the factthat the data for the different gubernias are dissimilarand not comparable. 
 Finally, to our characterisation ofthe Collections let us add that till 1891 inclusive they only covered trades not subject to excise duty, while from 1892 onwards they cover all trades, including mining and excise-paying; no special mention is made of data *It goes without saying that the data on the small establish-ments are quite haphazard: in some gubernias and in some years their number is given in hundreds and thousands, in others in tens and units. 
 For example, in Bessarabia Gubernia, from 1887 to 1890: 1,479—272—262—1,684; in Penza Gubernia, from 1885 to 1891: 4—15—0—1,127—1,135—2,148—2,264, etc.

 (See present edition, Vol. 
 4, “On the Question of Our Factory Statistics. 
”— Ed. 
) Mr. 
 Tugan-Bara-novsky was somewhat mistaken in asserting that the numberof actual factories dropped between 1885 and 1891 ( The Factory , p. 
 350), and comparing the average number of workers per factory for different trades at different times (ibid. 
, 355). 
 The data in theCollection are too chaotic for use, without being specially processed, in drawing such conclusions. 
 comparable with others given previously, and no explanation whatever is given of the methods by which ironworks are included in the total number of factories and works (for instance, ironworks statistics have never given the value butmerely the volume of works’ output. 
 How the compilers ofthe Collections arrived at the value of the output is unknown). 
 In the 1880s there was still another source of informa-tion about our factory industry, one deserving attention for its negative qualities and because Mr. 
 Karyshev useddata from this source. 
 * This is the Returns for Russia for 1884-85 (St. 
 Petersburg, 1887. 
 Published by the Central Statistical Committee), which gives in one of its tablesthe “totals of output of factory industry in European Russia, 1885” (Table XXXIX); the number of factories and of workers is given only for Russia as a whole, without beingdistributed according to gubernias. 
 The source of infor-mation is “data of reports of Messrs. 
 the Governors”(p. 
 311). 
 The data cover all trades, including both excise-paying and mining, and for every trade the “average” number of workers and output per works is given for the whole of European Russia. 
 Now it is these “averages” thatMr. 
 Karyshev proceeded to “analyse. 
” To judge their value,let us compare the data in the Returns with those in the Collection (to make such a comparison we must subtract from the first-mentioned data the metallurgical, excise-paying, fishing and “other” trades; this will leave 53 trades; the data are for European Russia): Number of Output S o u r c e s(thous and factoriesworkers rubles ) “Returns for Russia” ... 54,179 559,476 569,705 “Collection of Department of Commerce and Manu-facture” .......

 Karyshev, “Statistical Survey of the Distribution of the Principal Branches of Manufacturing Industry in Russia. 
” Yuridichesky Vestnik , 1889, No. 
 9, September. 
 Together with Mr. 
 Karyshev’s latest work, examined by us in our Studies , this article serves as an example of how not to handle our factory statistics. 
 Thus, the gubernatorial reports included tens of thou-sands of small agricultural and handicraft establishments among the “factories”! Of course, such establishments were included among the factories quite fortuitously for thevarious trades, and for the various gubernias and uyezds. 
Here are examples of the number of works according tothe Returns and the Collection , in some trades: fur—1,205 and 259; leather—4,079 and 2,026; mat-and-bag—562 and 55; starch-and-treacle—1,228 and 184; flour-milling— 17,765 and 3,940; oil-pressing—9,341 and 574; tar-distil-ling—3,366 and 328; brick-making—5,067 and 1,488;pottery and glazed tile—2,573 and 147. 
 One can imaginethe sort of “statistics” that will be obtained if one esti-mates the “size of establishments” * in our factory indus-try by taking “average figures” based on such a method of computing “factories”! But Mr. 
 Karyshev forms hisestimate in precisely this manner when he classes under large-scale industry only those trades in which the above-mentioned “ average number ” of workers per factory (for the whole of Russia) is over one hundred . 
 By this phenomenal method the conclusion is reached that only a quarter of the total output is provided by “large-scale industry asunderstood within the above-indicated limits”!! (p. 
 47 ofarticle cited). 
 ** Further on we shall show that factories with 100 and more workers actually account for more thanhalf the total output of our factory industry. 
 *Section IV of Mr. 
 Karyshev’s article. 
 Let us observe that for comparison with the Returns we could, instead of the Collection , have taken Mr. 
 Orlov’s Directory , the second edition of which (1884) is quoted by Mr. 
 Karyshev too. 
 **“Thus, three quarters of the latter” (total annual output) “is provided by establishments of a relatively small type. 
 Thisphenomenon may have its roots in many extremely important elements of Russian national economy. 
 To them, by the way, should be assigned the system of land tenure of the mass of the population , the tenacity of the village community (sic!), which raises serious obstaclesto the development of a professional class of factory workers in ourcountry. 
 With this is combined (!) the widespread character of the domestic form of the processing of products in the very (central) zone of Russia in which our factories and works are mainly concentrated” (ibid. 
, Mr. 
 Karyshev’s italics). 
 Poor “village community”! It alonemust bear all the blame for everything, even for the statistical errorsof its learned admirers! Let us observe, incidentally, that the data of the local gubernia statistical committees (which are used for the gubernatorial reports) are always distinguished by the utter vagueness of the term “factory-and-works” and by thecasual registration of small establishments. 
 Thus, inSmolensk Gubernia, for 1893-94, some uyezds counteddozens of small oil-presses as factories, while others did notcount any; the number of tar “works” in the gubernia was given as 152 (according to Directory for 1890, not one), with the same casual registration in the various uyezds,etc. 
 * For Yaroslavl Gubernia, the local statisticians in the 90s gave the number of factories as 3,376 (against 472in the Directory for 1890), including (for some uyezds) hundreds of flour-mills, smithies, small potato-processing works, etc. 
 ** Quite recently our factory statistics have undergone a reform which has changed the plan for the gathering ofinformation, changed the significance of the term “factory-and-works” (new criteria have been adopted; the presence of an engine or of not less than 15 workers), and enlistedfactory inspectors in the work of gathering and verifyinginformation. 
 We refer the reader for details to the above-mentioned article in our Studies *** where a detailed examination is made of the List of Factories and Works (St. 
 Petersburg, 1897) **** compiled according to the new plan, and where it is shown that despite the reform, improvements in our factory statistics are scarcely noticeable ; that the term “factory-and-works” has remained absolutelyvague; that the data are very often still quite haphazardand must, therefore, be handled with extreme caution.

 **** According to Mr. 
 Karyshev’s calculations, the totals of the figures given in the List relating to European Russia are: 14,578 factories, with 885,555 workers and an output totalling 1,345,346,000rubles. 
 ( *) The collections of factory inspectors’ reports published by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry (for 1901-1903) give data on Only a proper industrial census, organised on European lines, can extricate our industrial statistics from their chaotic condition. 
 * It follows from the review of our factory statistics that the data they contain cannot in the overwhelming majorityof cases be used without being specially processed, the prin-cipal object of which should be to separate the relativelyuseful from the utterly useless. 
 In the next section we shall examine in this respect the data on the most important trades, but at the moment we put the question: is the number of fac-tories in Russia increasing or decreasing? The main difficultyin answering this question is that in our factory statistics theterm “factory” is employed in the most chaotic manner;that is why the negative replies to this question which are sometimes given on the basis of factory statistics (e. 
g. 
, by Mr. 
 Karyshev) cannot be of any use. 
 We must firstestablish some definite criterion for the term “factory”;without that condition it would be absurd to illustratethe development of large-scale machine industry with the number of factories and works, as well as workers employed in them (for 64 gubernias of Russia), the factories and works being classi-fied according to the number of workers (up to 20; 21-50; 51-100;101-500-501-1,000; over 1,000). 
 This is a big step forward in ourfactory statistics. 
 The data for large workshops (21 workers and over)are probably reliable, at least in some degree. 
 The data for “factories”with fewer than 20 workers are obviously casual and utterly worth-less. 
 For example, in Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia the number offactories employing fewer than 20 workers in 1903 is given as 266;the number of workers employed in them—1,975, or an average offewer than 8 workers. 
 In Perm Gubernia there are 10 such factorieswith 159 workers! Ridiculous, of course. 
 The total for 1903 for 64 gubernias: 15,821 factories with 1,640,406 workers; and if we deduct factories and works employing fewer than 20 workers, we get 10,072 factories and works with 1,576,754 workers.

 Reports of papers and debates at Nizhni-Novgorod congress. 
 Mr. 
 Mikhailovsky very vividlydescribed the chaotic condition of factory statistics, showing how thequestionnaire travels “down to the lowest police official, who circulates it at last, getting a receipt, of course, to those industrial establish-ments which he deems worthy of attention, but most often in thoseof them which he circularised the previous years”;—how the repliesgiven to the various questions are either: “same as last year”—(it isenough to go over the Collections of the Department of Commerce and Manufacture for the various trades in various gubernias to be convinced of the truth of this)—or are absolutely meaningless, etc. 
 data for establishments of which the totals have at various times included various numbers of small flour-mills, oil-presses, brick-sheds, etc. 
, etc. 
 Let us take as a criterion the employment of not fewer than 16 workers in theestablishment, and then we shall see that the number ofsuch industrial establishments in European Russia in 1866was a maximum of from 2,500 to 3,000, in 1879 about4,500, in 1890 about 6,000, in 1894-95 about 6,400, and in 1903 about 9,000. 
 * Consequently, the number of factories in Russia in the post-Reform period is growing , and grow-ing fairly rapidly . 
 III. 
 AN EXAMINATION OF HISTORICO-STATISTICAL DATA ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF LARGE-SCALE INDUSTRY We have noted above that to judge the development of large-scale industry from factory statistics it is necessaryto separate the relatively useful material in these statistics from the utterly useless. 
 Let us, with this in view, examine the main branches of our manufacturing industry. 
 *The data concern all trades (i. 
e. 
, including excise-paying) except mining. 
 For 1879, 1890 and 1894-95 we have computed the data from Directories and the List. 
 From the data in the List we have excluded printing works, of which no account was taken formerly in factorystatistics (see Studies , p. 
 273) [See present edition, Vol 4, “On the Question of Our Factory Statistics. 
”— Ed. 
]. 
 For 1866 we have according to the data in the Yearbook for 71 trades, 1,861 establishments each employing 16 and more workers, out of a total of 6,891 establish-ments; in 1890 these 71 trades accounted for about four-fifths of thetotal number of establishments with 16 and more workers. 
 The crite-rion adopted by us for the term “factory” is, in our view, the mostexact, since the most varied programmes for our factory statisticshave undoubtedly accepted the inclusion of establishments with 16 and more workers among the factories, and this for all branches of industry. 
 There can be no doubt that the factory statistics never could,and cannot now, register all establishments employing 16 and more workers (see instances in Chapter VI, §II), but we have no groundsfor thinking that there were more omissions formerly than now. 
 For1903 the data are from the Collection of Factory Inspectors ’ Reports . 
 In the 50 gubernias of European Russia there were 8,856 factories and works with over 20 workers 41 each. 
 1) T e x t i l e T r a d e s At the head of the wool trades is cloth production, which in 1890 had an output of over 35 million rubles andemployed 45,000 workers. 
 The historico-statistical data on thistrade indicate a considerable drop in the number ofworkers, namely, from 72,638 in 1866 to 46,740 in 1890. 
 * T o appraise this phenomenon we must take account of the fact that up to the 1860s inclusive, felt cloth productionwas organised on specific and original lines: it was con-centrated in relatively large establishments which, however,did not in any way come under the category of capitalistfactory industry, since they were based on the labour of serfs, or of temporarily bound peasants. 
 In the surveys of the “factory” industry of the 60s we therefore meet with thedivision of cloth mills into 1) those owned by landlordsor nobles, and 2) those owned by merchants. 
 The formerproduced mainly army cloth, the government contracts havingbeen distributed equally among the mills in proportion to the number of machines. 
 Compulsory labour was the cause of the technical backwardness of such establishments andof their employing a much larger number of workers thanthe merchant mills based on the employment of hiredlabour. 
 ** The principal drop in the number of workers, engaged in felt cloth production took place in the gubernias with landlord factories; thus, in the 13 such gubernias (enumerated in the Survey of Manufactory Industries ), the number of workers dropped from 32,921 to 14,539 (1866and 1890), while in the 5 gubernias with merchant factories *In all cases, unless otherwise stated, we take the data of the Yearbook for 1866 and those of the Directories for 1879 and 1890. 
— The Historico-Statistical Survey (Vol. 
 II) gives annual information on cloth production from 1855 to 1879; the following are the five-year averages of workers employed from 1855-1859 to 1875-1879:107,433; 96,131; 92,117; 87,960 and 81,458. 
 **See A Survey of Various Branches of Manufactory Industry in Russia , Vol. 
 I, St. 
 Petersburg, 1862, particularly pp. 
 165 and 167. 
 Cf. 
 also Military Statistical Abstract , D. 
 357 and foll. 
 At the present time we rarely meet in the lists of cloth manufacturers the celebratednoble families that constituted the overwhelming majority in the1860s. 
 (Moscow, Grodno, Liflandia, Chernigov and St. 
 Petersburg) it dropped from 31,291 to 28,257. 
 From this it is clear that we have here two opposite trends, both of which, however, indicate the development of capitalism—on the one hand, the decline of landlord establishments of a manorial-posses-sional character,150 and on the other, the development of purely capitalist factories out of merchant establishments. 
 A considerable number of the workers employed in felt cloth production in the 60s were not factory workers at all in the strict sense of the term; they were dependent peasants working for landlords. 
 * Cloth production is an example of that specific phenomenon of Russian history—the employ-ment of serf labour in industry. 
 Since we are dealing only with the post-Reform period, the above brief remarks will suffice to show the way in which this phenomenon is reflected in factory statistics. 
 ** We shall now quote some figures drawn from statistics on steam-engines in order to estimate the development of large-scale machine production in this industry: in 1875-1878, in the wool-spinning and cloth industries of European Russia there were 167 mecha-nised establishments using 209 steam-engines with a total of4,632 h.

, and in 1890 there were 197 establishments using *The following examples are taken from Zemstvo statistical material.

 Gladkov’s cloth factory in Volsk Uyezd, Saratov Gubernia (in 1866 it had 306 workers), we read in the Zemstvostatistical abstract for this uyezd (p. 
 275) that peasants were forcedto work in the factory belonging to the lord. 
 “They worked in thefactory until they married, and then became tax-paying membersof the peasant community. 
” In the village of Ryassy, Ranenburg Uyezd, Ryazan Gubernia, there was in 1866 a cloth factory employing 180 workers. 
 The peasants performed their corvée by working in themill, which was closed down in 1870 ( Statistical Returns for Ryazan Gubernia , Vol.

 The use of steam power, therefore, did not make very rapid progress; this is to be explained partly by the traditions of land-lord factories and partly by the displacement of felt cloth by the cheaper worsted and mixed fabrics. 
 * In the years 1875-1878 there were seven mechanised establishments using 20 steam-engines with a total of 303 h. 
p. 
, and in 1890 there were 28 mechanised establishments employing 61 steam-engines to a total of 1,375 h. 
p. 
 ** In regard to the woollen-goods industry let us also take note of felt-making, a branch that shows in particularly striking fashion the impossibility of comparing factory statis-tics for different times: the figures for 1866 are 77 factories with a total of 295 workers, while for 1890 they are 57 factories with 1,217 workers. 
 The former figure includes 60 small establishments employing 137 workers with an out-put of under 2,000 rubles, while the latter includes an establishment with four workers. 
 In 1866 39 small estab-lishments were recorded in Semyonov Uyezd, Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia, where felt-making is now highly devel-oped but is regarded as a “handicraft” and not a “factory”industry (see Chapter VI, §II, 2). 
 Further, a particularly important place in the textile trades is held by cotton processing, a branch which now employs over 200,000 workers. 
 Here we observe one of the biggest errors of our factory statistics, namely, the combining of factory workers and capitalistically occu-pied home workers. 
 Large-scale machine industry developed here (as in many other cases) by drawing home workers into the factory. 
 It is obvious how distorted this process will appear if work-distributing offices and work-rooms are classed as “factories,” if home workers are lumped *Cf. 
 Successes of Russian Industry According to Surveys of Expert Commissions , St. 
 Petersburg, 1897, p. 
 60. 
 **The data on steam-engines in this and the following instances are taken from Material for the Statistics of Steam-Engines in the Russian Empire published by the Central Statistical Committee, St. 
 Petersburg, 1882; for 1890 they are taken from Collection of Data on Factory Industry ; data on mechanised establishments are from the Directory . 
 together with factory workers! For 1866 (according to the Yearbook ) up to 22,000 home workers were included among factory workers (by no means the full number, for theYearbook , evidently by pure accident, omits in the case of Moscow Gubernia those notes about “work from villageto village” which are so abundant for Vladimir Gubernia). 
For 1890 (according to the Directory ) we found only about 9,000 such workers. 
 Clearly, the figures given in the factory statistics (1866—59,000 workers in the cotton-weaving mills; 1890—75,000) underrate the increase in the number of factory workers that actually took place. 
 * Here are data showing what different establishments wereclassed at different times as cotton-weaving “factories”: ** Total cotton-These include Y e a r sweavingfactoriesoffices workrooms“factories” 1866 436 256 38 142 1879 411 209 66 136 1890 311 283 21 7 Thus, the decrease in the number of “factories” shown by the “statistics” actually indicates the displacing ofdistributing offices and workrooms by the factory. 
 Let usillustrate this by the example of two factories: *Cf. 
 Tugan-Baranovsky, loc. 
 cit. 
, p. 
 420. 
—The total number of village hand weavers working for capitalists was estimated by Semyonov at approximately 385,857 in 1859 (loc. 
 cit. 
, III, 273); to these he added another 200,000 village workers engaged “in otherfactory trades” (ibid. 
, p. 
 302). 
 At the present time, as we have seen above, the number of capitalistically employed home workers is much larger. 
 **Establishments with an output of under 2,000 rubles are classed as workrooms. 
 The data of the special investigation of facto-ries and works in Moscow and Vladimir gubernias made in 1868 by the Central Statistical Committee contain the repeated statement that the output figures of the small weaving establishments merelyindicate pay for work done. 
 Establishments that distribute work tohome workers are classed as offices. 
 For 1866 the figure given for these establishments is far from complete, owing to obvious omissions in the case of Moscow Gubernia.

 In the 1860sthere were about 11,000, * and in 1890 about 87,000. 
 Large-scale machine industry was consequently developing atenormous speed. 
 In cotton spinning and weaving there was recorded in 1875-1878 a total of 148 mechanised estab-lishments, having 481 steam-engines totalling 20,504 h.

,and in 1890, 168 mechanised establishments, having 554steam-engines with a total of 38,750 h.

 Precisely the same mistake is made in Russian statistics in relation to linen production, wherein a decrease in the number of factory workers is erroneously shown (1866— 17,171; 1890—15,497). 
 Actually, in 1866, of 16,900 loomsbelonging to linen-mill owners only 4,749 were kept in theirestablishments, the remaining 12,151 being held by work-room owners. 
 ** The number of factory workers for 1866, therefore, included about 12,000 home workers, and for 1890 only about 3,000 (computed from Directory ). 
 The number of power-looms, however, grew from 2,263 in 1866(computed from Military Statistical Abstract ) to 4,041 in *Military Statistical Abstract , 380.

 Petersburg, 1863, p.

 * Lastly, of the textile trades mention should be made of dyeing, printing and finishing, in which trades the factory statistics combine factories and the very smallest handi-craft establishments with only 1 or 2 workers each andan output of a few hundred rubles. 
 ** Naturally, this causes no little confusion and obscures the rapid growth of large-scale machine industry. 
 The following figures reflect thisgrowth: in the wool-cleaning, dyeing, bleaching and finishing trades in 1875-1878 there were 80 mechanised establishments with 255 steam-engines totalling 2,634h.

 2) W o o d -W o r k i n g I n d u s t r i e s In this section the most reliable data are those on saw-milling, although in the past small establishments were also included here. 
 *** The enormous development of this trade in the post-Reform period (1866—4 million rubles; 1890—19 million rubles), accompanied by a considerableincrease in the number of workers (4,000 and 15,000) and inthe number of steam-powered establishments (26 and 430),is particularly interesting, in that it affords striking evidence of the growth of the lumber industry. 
 Saw-milling is but one of the operations of the lumber industry, which is a necessaryconcomitant of the first steps of large-scale machine industry. 
 As to the rest of the trades in this section, namely, *In silk-weaving in 1879 there were 495 power-looms and 5,996 hand-looms ( Historico-Statistical Survey ), and in 1890 there **For example, in 1879 the number of factories computed in these trades was 729; of this number, 466 had 977 workers and an out-put of 170,000 rubles. 
 Even today one can find many such “factories”—for instance, in the description of the handicraft industries of Vyatkaand Perm gubernias.

 furnishing and carpentry, bast-matting, and pitch and tar—the factory statistics relating to them are distin-guished for their particularly chaotic condition. 
 The small establishments so numerous in these trades were formerlyincluded among the “factories” in numbers fixed arbi-trarily, and the same is sometimes done even today. 
 * 3) C h e m i c a l, L i v e s t o c k -P r o d u c t a n d C e r a m i c I n d u s t r i e s The statistics on the chemical industry proper are dis-tinguished for their relative reliability. 
 The following returnsshow its growth: in 1857 chemical products were consumedin Russia to a total of 14 million rubles (3. 
4 millionrubles home produced and 10. 
6 million rubles imported); in 1880, to a total of 36 4 million rubles (7 2 million ru-bles home produced and 28 w imported); and in 1890, to a total of 42. 
7 million rubles (16. 
1 million rubles homeproduced and 26. 
6 imported). 
 ** These data are particularly interesting because the chemical industries are extremelyimportant as producers of auxiliary materials for large-scale machine industry, i. 
e. 
, articles of productive (and not per-sonal) consumption. 
 As to potash and saltpetre production,let us remark that the number of factories given is unre-liable, again due to the inclusion of small establishments. 
 *** *Thus in 1879, of 91 bast-matting factories 39 had an output of less than 1,000 rubles each (Cf. 
 Studies , p. 
 155). 
 [See present edi-tion Vol. 
 2, The Handicraft Census of 1894-95 in Perm Gubernia .

] In the pitch-and-tar trade for 1890 there were computed 140 factories, all with an output exceeding 2,000 rubles; for 1879, 1,033were computed, of which 911 had an output of less than 2,000 rubles;for 1866 the number listed was 669 (for the Empire), while the Military Statistical Abstract even gave the figure of 3,164!!

 The production of saltpetre is now concentrated in one factory in St. 
Petersburg, whereas in the 60s and 70s saltpetre was obtained from The tallow trade has undoubtedly declined in the post-Reform period. 
 Thus, the value of output of the tallow-candle and tallow-boiling trade was estimated in 1866-1868 at 13. 
6 million rubles, and in 1890 at 5 millionrubles. 
 * This decline is to be explained by the growing use of mineral oils for lighting, which are displacing the old-time tallow candle. 
 For leather production (1866: 2,308 establishments with 11,463 workers and an output totalling 14. 
6 million rubles; 1890: 1,621 establishments with 15,564 workers and anoutput totalling 26. 
7 million rubles) statistics constantlylump together factories and small establishments. 
 Therelatively high cost of raw materials, which explains thehigh total output, and the fact that this trade requires very few workers, make it particularly difficult to draw a line of demarcation between the handicraft establishments andthe factories. 
 In 1890, of the total number of factories(1,621), only 103 had an output of less than 2,000 rubles;in 1879 there were 2,008 out of a total of 3,320 **; in 1866, of 2,308 factories *** 1,042 had an output of less than 1,000 rubles (these 1,042 factories employed 2,059 workers and had an output totalling 474,000 rubles). 
 Thus, the numberof factories increased, although the factory statistics showa decrease. 
 As for the small leather establishments, theirnumber is still very large today: for instance, The Factory Industry and Trade of Russia , published by the Ministry of Finance (St. 
 Petersburg, 1893), gives a total of nearly 9,500 handicraft works, with 21,000 workers and an outputof 12 million rubles. 
 These “handicraft” establishmentsare much larger than those which in the 60s were includedamong “factories and works. 
” Since small establishments *Here, too, the number of factories in the 60s and 70s included a host of small establishments. 
 **In 1875, Prof. 
 Kittary, in his Map of Leather Production in Russia , gave an aggregate of 12,939 establishments, with output totalling 47 2 million rubles, whereas the factory statistics gave 2,764 establishments, with output totalling 26 2 million rubles (Historico-Statistical Survey ). 
 In the fur trade, another in this section, a similar lumping is observed of small establishments together withfactories: Cf. 
 Directory for 1879 and for 1890. 
 *** The Military Statistical Abstract gave an aggregate of even 3,890!! are included among the “factories and works” in unequal numbers in the different gubernias and in different years, the statistics on this trade should be treated with great caution. 
 The steam-engine statistics for 1875-1878 gavefor this industry 28 mechanised establishments with 33steam-engines to a total of 488 h. 
p. 
 and in 1890 there were66 mechanised establishments with 82 steam-engines toa total of 1,112 h. 
p. 
 In these 66 factories 5,522 workers (more than a third of the total) were concentrated with an output totalling 12. 
3 million rubles (46% of the total),so that the concentration of production was very con-siderable, and the productivity of labour in the largeestablishments far above the average. 
 * The ceramic trades fall into two categories in accord-ance with the character of the factory statistics: in some, there is hardly any combining of small-scale productionwith large. 
 That is why these statistics are fairly reliable. 
This applies to the following industries: glass, porcelainand chinaware, plaster and cement. 
 Particularly remark-able is the rapid growth of the last-mentioned trade, which is evidence of the development of the building industry: the total output in 1866 was estimated at 530,000rubles ( Military Statistical Abstract ), and in 1890 at 3,826,000 rubles; the number of power-operated establishments in1875-1878 was 8, and in 1890 it was 39. 
 On the other hand,in the pottery and brick trades the inclusion of small establishments is observed on a tremendous scale, and for that reason the factory statistics are very unsatisfactory,being particularly exaggerated for the 60s and 70s. 
 Thus,in the pottery trade in 1879 there were listed 552 establish-ments, with 1,900 workers and an output totalling 538,000rubles, and in 1890, 158 establishments with 1,978 workers and an output totalling 919,000 rubles. 
 If we subtract the small establishments (those with an output of lessthan 2,000 rubles) we get: 1879—70 establishments, with *If we distribute the factories shown in the Directory as for 1890 according to date of establishment we get the following: of 1,506 factories the number established at dates unknown was 91, before1850—331; in the 1850s—147; in the 60s—239; in the 70s—320; inthe 80s—351; in 1890—21. 
 In every succeeding decade more factorieswere established than in the preceding one. 
 840 workers and an output of 505,000 rubles; 1890—143 establishments, with 1,859 workers and an output of 857,000 rubles. 
 That is to say, instead of the decrease in the number of “factories” and stagnation in the number of workersshown in the statistics, there was actually a considerableincrease in both the one and the other. 
 In brick-makingthe official data for 1879 showed 2,627 establishments,with 28,800 workers and an output totalling 6,963,000 rubles; for 1890—1,292 establishments, with 24,334 workers and an output of 7,249,000 rubles; and without the smallestablishments (those with an output of less than 2,000rubles) we get for 1879—518 establishments, with 19,057workers and an output of 5,625,000 rubles; and for 1890—1,096 establishments, with 23,222 workers and an output of 7,240,000 rubles. 
 * 4) M e t a l l u r g i c a l I n d u s t r i e s In the factory statistics for the metallurgical indus-tries the sources of confusion are, firstly, the inclusion of small establishments (exclusively in the 60s and 70s), ** and, secondly and mainly, the fact that metallurgical plants are “subject, not to the jurisdiction” of the Depart-ment of Commerce and Manufacture, but to that of theDepartment of Mines. 
 The returns of the Ministry ofFinance usually omit ironworks “on principle”; but there have never been uniform and invariable rules for the separa-tion of ironworks from the other works (and it would hardly *The small establishments in these industries are now classed with the handicrafts. 
 Cf. 
, for instance, the table of small industries(Appendix I) or Studies , pp. 
 158-159. 
 (See present edition, Vol. 
 2, The Handicraft Census of 1894-95 in Perm Gubernia . 
—Ed. 
). 
 The Ministry of Finance Yearbook (Vol. 
 I) refused to give totals for these industries because the figures were obviously exaggerated. 
 Progress in statistics since then is expressed in an increased boldness and disregard of the quality of material used. 
 **Thus, in the 60s, dozens of smithies were classed for some gubernias as “ironworks. 
” See Returns and Material of the Ministry of Finance , 1866, No.

 also the example quoted above (§II) where the Yearbook for 1866 includes the small handicraftsmen of the Pavlovo district among the “factory owners:” be possible to devise them). 
 That is why the factory statis-tics published by the Ministry of Finance always include ironworks to some extent, although the actual degree to which they are included varies for different gubernias andfor different years. 
 * General data on the increased use of steam-engines in metallurgy since the Reform will begiven below, when we deal with the mining and metallur-gical industry. 
 5) F o o d I n d u s t r i e s These industries merit special attention for the question that concerns us, since the confusion in factory statisticsattains here its maximum. 
 And yet, these industries occupy a prominent place in our factory industry as a whole. 
 Thus, according to the Directory for 1890 these indus-tries account for 7,095 factories, with 45,000 workers andan output totalling 174 million rubles out of a total forEuropean Russia of 21,124 factories, with 875,764 workersand an output of 1,501 million rubles. 
 The fact is that the principal trades of this group—flour-milling, groat-milling and oil-pressing—consist of the processing ofagricultural produce. 
 There are hundreds and thousandsof small establishments in Russia engaged in this process-ing in every gubernia, and since there are no generallyestablished rules for selecting the “factories and works” from among them, the statistics pick out such small establish-ments quite fortuitously . 
 That is why the numbers of “facto-ries and works” for different years and for different guberniasfluctuate enormously. 
 Here, for example, are the figures forthe flour-milling trade for various years, as taken fromvarious sources: 1865—857 mills ( Returns and Material of the Ministry of Finance ); 1866—2,176 ( Yearbook ); 1866—18,426 (Military Statistical Abstract ); 1885—3,940 ( Collection ); 17,765 ( Returns for Russia ); 1889, 1890 and 1891—5,073, *See examples in Studies , p. 
 269 and p. 
 284 (see present edition, Vol. 
 4, “On the Question of Our Factory Statistics. 
”— Ed. 
), where Mr. 
 Karyshev’s error in ignoring this circumstance is examined. 
 TheDirector y for 1879, for instance, includes the Kulebaki and Vyksa ironworks, or departments of them (pp. 
 356 and 374), which are omitted in the Directory for 1890. 
 /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR 5,605 and 5,201 * (Collection ); 1894-95—2,308 ( List ). 
 Among the 5,041 mills listed in 1892 ( Collection ), 803 were steam-, 2,907 water-, 1,323 wind-and 8 horse-operated! Some gubernias counted only steam-mills, others includedwatermills (in numbers ranging from 1 to 425), still others(the minority) included also windmills (from 1 to 530) andhorse-operated mills. 
 One can imagine the value of suchstatistics, and of conclusions based on a credulous use of the data they provide! ** Obviously, to judge the growth of large-scale machine industry we must first establish adefinite criterion for the term “factory. 
” Let us take as sucha criterion the employment of steam-engines: steam-millsare a characteristic concomitant of the epoch of large-scalemachine industry.

 only apparent. 
 If the data for 1879 and 1890 are made com-parable, i. 
e. 
, if we exclude establishments with an output of less than 2,000 rubles (not included in the lists) we get for 1879: 272 works, with 2,941 workers and an outputtotalling 5,771,000 rubles, and for 1890—379 works, with4,741 workers and an output totalling 12,232,000 rubles. 
That large-scale machine industry has developed in thistrade no less rapidly than in flour-milling is evident, for example, from the statistics for steam-engines; in 1875-1878 there were 27 steam-powered works, with 28 steam-engines of 521 h. 
p. 
, while in 1890 there were 113 mechanisedworks, with 116 steam-engines totalling 1,886 h. 
p. 
 The other trades of this group are relatively small. 
 Let us note that in the mustard and fish-products trades, for instance, the statistics of the 60s included hundreds of small establishments such as have nothing whatever incommon with factories and are now not classed as such. 
The extent to which our factory statistics for various yearsneed correction is evident from the following: with theexception of flour-milling, the Directory for 1879 gave in this section a total of 3,555 establishments with 15,313 workers, and for 1890—1,842 establishments with 19,159workers. 
 For 7 trades, * small establishments (with an output of less than 2,000 rubles) were included as follows: in 1879—2,487 with 5,176 workers and an output totalling 916,000rubles and in 1890, seven establishments, employing ten workers and with an output totalling two thousand rubles! To make the data comparable, one should, consequently,subtract in one case five thousand workers, and in the other, ten persons! 6) E x c i s e -P a y i n g a n d O t h e r T r a d e s In some of the excise-paying trades we observe a decrease in the number of factory workers between the 1860s and the present day, but the decrease is not nearly asconsiderable as is asserted by Mr. 
 N. 
 —on, ** who blindly *Oil-pressing, starch, treacle, malt, confectionery, preserves and vinegar. 
 **Russkoye Bogatstvo , 1894, No. 
 6, pp. 
 104-105. 
 believes every figure in print. 
 The fact is that for the majority of excise-paying trades the only source of informa-tion is the Military Statistical Abstract , which, as we know, tremendously exaggerates the totals in thefactory statistics. 
 Unfortunately, however, we have littlematerial with which to verify the data in the Abstract . 
 In distilling, the Military Statistical Abstract counted in 1866 a total of 3,836 distilleries with 52,660 workers (in 1890—1,620, with 26,102 workers), but the number of distilleries does not coincide with the data of the Ministryof Finance, which in 1865-66 calculated 2,947 operating dis-tilleries and in 1866-67—3,386. 
 * Judging by this, the number of workers is exaggerated by some 5,000 to 9,000. 
 Invodka distilling, the Military Statistical Abstract computes 4,841 distilleries, with 8,326 workers (1890: 242 distilleries with 5,266 workers); of these Bessarabia Gubernia has3,207 distilleries with 6,873 workers. 
 The absurdity ofthese figures is glaring. 
 In fact, we learn from materialpublished by the Ministry of Finance ** that the actual number of vodka distilleries in Bessarabia Gubernia was 10 or 12, and in the whole of European Russia 1,157. 
 The num-ber of workers was consequently exaggerated by a minimum of 6 thousand . 
 The cause of this exaggeration is, evidently, that the Bessarabian “statisticians” included vineyard ownersamong the owners of distilleries (see below on tobacco-making). 
 In beer-and mead-brewing, the Military Statistical Abstract counts 2,374 breweries, with 6,825 workers (1890— 918 breweries, with 8,364 workers), whereas The Ministry of Finance Yearbook estimates a total of 2,087 breweries in European Russia for 1866. 
 The number of workers is exag-gerated here too.

 sons, as against 80,919 according to the data of The Minis-try of Finance Yearbook (1890—77,875 workers). 
 In tobacco-making, the Military Statistical Abstract gives 5,327 factories, with 26,116 workers (1890—281 facto-ries, with 26,720 workers); of these, 4,993 factories with20,038 workers are in Bessarabia Gubernia. 
 Actually, thenumber of tobacco factories in Russia in 1866 was 343, andin Bessarabia Gubernia 13. 
 * The number of workers has been exaggerated by about 20 thousand , and even the com-pilers of the Military Statistical Abstract themselves indicated that “the factories shown in Bessarabia Gubernia. 
 . 
 . 
 are nothing but tobacco plantations” (p. 
 414). 
 Mr. 
 N. 
 —on evidently thought it superfluous to glance at the text ofthe statistical publication he uses; that is why he failed to notice the error, and discoursed with a highly serious air about a “slight increase in the number of workers inthe . 
 . 
 . 
 tobacco factories” (article cited, p. 
 104)!! Mr. 
 N. 
 —on simply takes the total number of workers in the excise-paying trades from the Military Statistical Abstract and the Directory for 1890 (186,053 and 144,332) and calculates the percentage of decrease. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 “In a period of 25 years there has been a considerable drop in the number of workersemployed. 
 It has diminished by 22. 
4%. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 “Here” (i. 
e. 
, in theexcise-paying trades) “we see no signs of an increase, theplain fact being that the number of workers has simplydeclined by a quarter of its previous magnitude” (ibid. 
). 
 Indeed, what could be “simpler”! Take the first figure you lay your hands on, and calculate a percentage! As for thetrifling circumstance that the figure given in theMilitary Statistical Abstract exaggerates the number of workers by some forty thousand , that can be ignored. 
 7) C o n c l u s i o n s The criticism of our factory statistics given in the last two sections leads us to the following main conclusions: *The Ministry of Finance Yearbook , p. 
 61. 
 Cf. 
 Survey of Manu-factory Industry (Vol. 
 II, St. 
 Petersburg, 1863), which gives detailed information for 1861: 534 factories, with 6,937 workers; and in Bessa-rabia Gubernia, 31 factories, with 73 workers. 
 The number of tobaccofactories fluctuates greatly from year to year. 
 1. 
The number of factories in Russia has been rapidly growing in the post-Reform period . 
 The opposite conclusion, which follows from our factory statistics, is erroneous. 
 The point is that the figures weare given of factories include small artisan, handicraftand agricultural establishments, and the further back we go from the present day , the larger the number of small establishments included in the number of factories . 
 2. 
The number of factory workers and the volume of output of factories and works are likewise exaggerated for the pastperiod in our statistics . 
 This is due, firstly, to the fact that formerly a greater number of small establishments wereincluded. 
 Hence, the data for the industries that mergewith handicrafts are particularly unreliable. 
 * Secondly, it is due to the fact that in the past more capitalistically employed home workers were classified as factory workersthan today. 
 3. 
 It is customary in this country to think that if figures are taken from the official factory statistics they mustbe considered comparable with other figures taken from the same source, and must be regarded as more or less reliable, until the contrary is proved. 
 What has been saidabove, however, leads to the opposite conclusion, namely,that all comparisons of our factory statistics for differenttimes and for different gubernias must be regarded asunreliable until the reverse is proved. 
 IV. 
 THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MINING INDUSTRY ** In the initial period of Russia’s post-Reform development the principal centre of ore-mining was the Urals. 
 Consti-tuting a single area, until quite recently separated sharply *If we take the gross figures for all trades and for long periods, the exaggeration resulting from the cause mentioned will not be great,for the small establishments account for a small percentage of the total number of workers and the total output. 
 It goes without saying that one presumes a comparison of figures taken from similar sources(there can be no question of comparing the returns of the Ministryof Finance with those of gubernatorial reports, or of the Military Statistical Abstract ).

 III, St. 
 Petersburg, 1859, pp.

 from Central Russia, it has at the same time an original industrial structure. 
 For ages the basis of the “organisation of labour” in the Urals was serfdom, which to this day, the very end of the 19th century, leaves its impress on quiteimportant aspects of life in this mining area. 
 In the olddays serfdom was the basis of the greatest prosperity ofthe Urals and of its dominant position, not only in Russia,but partly also in Europe. 
 In the 18th century iron was one of Russia’s principal items of export; in 1782 nearly 3. 
8 million poods of iron were exported; in 1800-1815 from 2to 1 2 million poods; in 1815-1838 about 1 3 million poods. 
 Already “in the 20s of the 19th century Russia wasproducing 1 2 times as much pig-iron as France, 4 2 times as much as Prussia and 3 times as much as Belgium. 
” But the very serfdom that helped the Urals to rise to such heights when European capitalism was in its initial period wasthe very cause of the Urals’ decline when capitalism wasin its heyday. 
 The iron industry in the Urals developed veryslowly. 
 In 1718 Russia’s output of pig-iron was about 6 2 million poods, in 1767 about 9 2 million poods, in 1806— 12 million poods, in the 30s—9 to 11 million poods, in the 40s—11 to 13 million poods, in the 50s—12 to 16 millionpoods, in the 60s—13 to 18 million poods, in 1867—17 2 million poods. 
 In one hundred years the output was not evendoubled, and Russia dropped far behind other European Ministry of Finance Yearbook , Vol.

 The main cause of stagnation in the Urals was serfdom; the ironmasters were at once feudal landlords and indus-trialists, and their power was based not on capital and com-petition, but on monopol y * and their possessional right. 
 The Ural ironmasters are big landowners even today. 
 In1890, the 262 ironworks in the Empire had 11. 
4 million dessiatines of land (including 8. 
7 million dessiatines of forestland), of which 10. 
2 million belonged to 111 Uralsironworks (forestland covering 7. 
7 million dessiatines). 
On the average, consequently, each Urals works possessesvast latifundia covering some hundred thousand dessia-tines. 
 The allotment of land to the peasants from these estates has to this day not been completed. 
 Labour is obtained in the Urals, not only by hire, but also on the labour-service basis. 
 The Zemstvo statistics for Krasnoufimsk Uyezd, Perm Gubernia, for example, estimate that thereare thousands of peasant farms that have the use of fac-tory-owned land, pastures, woodland, etc. 
, either gratis, or at a low rent. 
 It stands to reason that this free use of the land actually has a very high cost, for it serves to reducewages to a very low level; the ironworks get their “own”workers, tied down to the works and cheaply paid . 
 ** *When the peasants were emancipated, the Ural ironmasters particularly insisted on, and secured the retention of, a law prohibit-ing the opening of any coal-and wood-burning establishments within the area of their undertakings. 
 For some details, see Studies , pp. 
 193-194. 
 (See present edition, Vol. 
 2, The Handicraft Census of 1894-95 in Perm Gubernia . 
—Ed. 
) **The Ural worker “is ... partly a cultivator, so that work in the mines is of good assistance to him on his farm, although the pay is lower than in the other mining-and-metal districts” (Vestnik Finansov , 1897, No. 
 8). 
 As we know, the terms on which the Ural peasants were emancipated from serf dependence were made to correspond to their position in the mining industry. 
 The mining and works populationwas divided into workmen having no land, who had to work in theindustry all year round, and agricultural labourers, having allotments, who had to do auxiliary jobs. 
 Highly characteristic is the term that has survived to this day, namely, of Ural workers being “debtbound. 
”When, for example, one reads in the Zemstvo statistics “informationabout a team of workers bound by debt to their jobs in the shops ofthe Arta works” one involuntarily turns to the title-page to see the date: Is it really ninety-four, and not, say, forty-four ? 151 Here is the way Mr. 
 V. 
 D. 
 Belov describes these relation-ships: The Urals enjoy the advantage, says Mr. 
 Belov, of having This lofty principle of mutual benefit manifests itself primarily in reduction of wages to a particularly low level. 
“In the South . 
 . 
 . 
 a worker costs twice and even three timesas much as in the Urals”—for example, according to datacovering several thousand workers, 450 rubles (annuallyper worker) as against 177 rubles. 
 In the South “at the firstopportunity of earning a decent wage in the fields of their native villages or anywhere else, the workers leave the iron-works, and coal- or ore-mines” (Vestnik Finanso v, 1897, No. 
 17, p. 
 265). 
 In the Urals, however, a decent wage is not to be dreamt of. 
 Naturally and inseparably connected with the low wages and servile status of the Ural workers is the technical backwardness of the Urals. 
 There pig-iron is smelted mostly *Transactions of the Commission of Inquiry into Handicraft Industry , Vol. 
 XVI, St. 
 Petersburg, 1887, pp. 
 8-9 and foll. 
 The same author later goes on to talk about “healthy people’s” industry!workers who have been moulded by their “original” history. 
 “Workers in other factories, abroad, or even in St. 
 Petersburg, have not theinterests of their factory at heart: they are here today and gone tomorrow. 
 While the factory is running they work; when losses take the place of profits, they take up their knapsacks and go off as fastand as readily as they came. 
 They and their employers are permanentenemies.... 
 The position is entirely different in the case of the Uralworkers. 
 They are natives of the place and in the vicinity of theworks they have their land, their farms and their families. 
 Their own welfare is closely, inseparably, bound up with the welfare of the works. 
 If it does well, they do well; if it does badly, it is bad for them; butthey cannot leave it (sic!): they have more here than a knapsack(sic!); to leave means to wreck their whole world, to abandon theland, farm and family.... 
 And so they are ready to hang on for yearsto work at half pay, or, what amounts to the same thing, to remain unemployed half their working time so that other local workers like themselves may earn a crust of bread. 
 In short, they are ready toaccept any terms the employers offer, so long as they are allowed toremain.... 
 Thus, there is an inseparable bond between the Ural workersand the works; the relationships are the same today as they were inthe past, before their emancipation from serf dependence; only the form of these relationships has changed, nothing more. 
 The former principle of serfdom has been superseded by the lofty principle ofmutual benefit. 
 ” * with the aid of wood fuel, in old-fashioned furnaces with cold or slightly heated blast. 
 In 1893, the number of cold-blast furnaces in the Urals was 37 out of 110, while in the South, there were 3 out of 18. 
 A mineral-fuel furnacehad an average output of 1. 
4 million poods per year, whilea wood-fuel furnace had one of 217,000 poods. 
 In 1890Mr. 
 Keppen wrote: “The refining process of smelting pig-iron isstill firmly established in the ironworks of the Urals, whereas in other parts of Russia it has been almost entirely displaced by the puddling process. 
” 152 Steam-engines are used to a far less extent in the Urals than in the South. 
 Lastly,we cannot but note the seclusion of the Urals, its isolation from the centre of Russia owing to the vast distance and the absence of railways. 
 Until quite recently the products of the Urals were transported to Moscow mainly by the prim-itive method of “floating” by river once a year. 
 * Thus the most direct survivals of the pre-Reform system, extensive practice of labour-service, bonded condition of theworkers, low productivity of labour, backwardness of tech-nique, low wages, prevalence of hand production, primi-tive and rapaciously antediluvian exploitation of the region’snatural wealth, monopolies, hindrances to competition, seclusion and isolation from the general commercial and industrial march of the times—such is the general pictureof the Urals. 
 The mining area in the South ** is in many respects the very opposite of the Urals. 
 The South is in the period of *For a description of this floating see Crags by Mr. 
 Mamin-Sibiryak. 
 In his writings this author vividly portrays the specific life of the Urals, which differs very little from that of the pre-Reformperiod, with the lack of rights, ignorance and degradation of a popu-lation tied down to the factories, with the “earnest, childish dissipa-tions” of the “gentry,” and the absence of that middle stratum of so-ciety (middle class and other intellectuals) which is so characteristic of capitalist development in all countries, not excluding Russia. 
 **In mining statistics the term “South and South-West Russia” means the Volhynia, Don, Ekaterinoslav, Kiev, Astrakhan, Bessa-rabia, Podolsk, Taurida, Kharkov, Kherson and Chernigov gubernias. 
It is to these that the quoted figures apply. 
 All that is said further on about the South could also be said (with slight modifications) of Poland, which forms another mining area of outstanding signifi-cance in the post-Reform period. 
 formation and is as young as the Urals are old and the system prevailing there “time-hallowed. 
” The purely capital-ist industry which has arisen here during recent decades recognises no traditions, no social-estate or national divi-sions, no seclusion of definite sections of the population. 
There has been a mass influx of foreign capital, engineersand workers into South Russia; and in the present period ofboom (1898) entire factories are being brought there from America.

21 These figures clearly show what a technical revolution is now taking place in Russia, and what an enormous capac-ity for the development of productive forces is possessedby large-scale capitalist industry. 
 The predominance ofthe Urals meant the predominance of serf labour, technicalbackwardness and stagnation.

— Ed. 
 *** It goes without saying that the Ural ironmasters depict the situation somewhat differently. 
 Here is a sample of their eloquent see that the development of metallurgical industry is proceeding faster in Russia than in Western Europe and in some respects even faster than in the United States. 
 In 1870 Russia produced 2. 
9% of the world output of pig-iron(22 million poods out of 745 million), and in 1894—5. 
1%(81. 
3 million poods out of 1,584. 
2) ( Vestnik Finansov , 1897, No. 
 22). 
 In the last 10 years (1886-1896) Russia hastrebled her output of pig-iron (32 2 to 96 2 million poods), whereas it took France, for example, 28 years to do so (1852-1880), the U. 
S. 
A. 
 23 years (1845-1868), England 22 (1824-1846) and Germany 12 (1859-1871; see Vestnik Finansov , 1897, No. 
 50). 
 The development of capitalism in theyoung countries is greatly accelerated by the example and the aid of the old countries. 
 Of course, the last decade (1888-1898) has been a period of exceptional boom, which, like all capitalist prosperity, will inevitably lead to acrisis; but capitalist development cannot proceed at allexcept in spurts. 
 The introduction of machinery into production and the increase in the number of workers have been much more rapid in the South than in the Urals. 
 * complaints at last year’s congresses: “The historical services rendered by the Urals are common knowledge. 
 For two hundred years all Russiaploughed and reaped, hammered, dug and hewed with the productsof Ural factories. 
 The Russian people wore on their breasts crossesmade of Ural copper, rode on Ural axles, used fire-arms made of Ural steel, cooked pancakes on Ural frying-pans, and rattled Ural pennies in their pockets The Urals satisfied the requirements of the entireRussian people ...” (who used scarcely any iron. 
 In 1851 the consump-tion of pig-iron in Russia was estimated at about 14 pounds per inhab-itant, in 1895—1. 
13 poods, and in 1897—1. 
33 poods) “... producingarticles to suit their needs and tastes. 
 The Urals generously (?) squan-dered their natural wealth, without chasing after fashion, or being carried away by the making of rails, fire grates and monuments. 
 And in return for their centuries of service—they found themselves one fine day forgotten and neglected” ( Vestnik Finansov , 1897, No. 
 32; Results of Mining Congresses in the Ural s). 
 Indeed, what neglect of “time-hallowed” institutions. 
 And it is all the fault of insidious capi-talism, which has introduced such “instability” into our national economy. 
 How much nicer it would be to live in the old way, without “being carried away by the making of rails,” and to cook oneself pan-cakes on Ural frying-pans! *Mr.

* Consequently, it is capitalist large-scale industry that rapidly increases the number of workers, at the same time enormously increasing the productivity oftheir labour. 
 Alongside of the South, mention should be made of the Caucasus, which is also characterised by an amazing growthof the mining industry in the post-Reform period. 
 The out-put of oil, which in the 60s did not even reach a million poods (557,000 in 1865), was in 1870—1.

 Nearlyall the oil is obtained in Baku Gubernia, and Baku “from an insignificant town has turned into a first-class Russian industrial centre, with 112,000 inhabitants. 
” ** The *The number of workers in iron production in the Urals in 1886 was 145,910, and in 1893—164,126, in the South 5,956 and 16,467.

 For 1902 there are no data on the number of steam-engines and horse-power.

 in wholeof Russia in Urals in South enormous development of the extraction and processing of oil has given rise in Russia to a greater consumption of kerosene that has completely ousted the American product (increase of personal consumption with the cheapening ofthe product by factory processing), and to a still greaterconsumption of oil by-products as fuel in factories, in worksand on the railways (increase of productive consumption). 
 * The number of workers in the mining industry of the Cau-casus has also grown very rapidly: from 3,431 in 1877 to 17,603 in 1890, i. 
e. 
, has increased fivefold . 
 To illustrate the structure of industry in the South let us take the data for the coal industry in the Donets Basin(where the average mine is smaller than in any other partof Russia). 
 Classifying the mines according to number of workers employed, we get the following picture: ** (See Table on p. 
 493. 
) Thus, in this area (and in this one only) there are extremely small peasants’ mines, which, however, despitetheir great number, play an absolutely insignificant partin the total output (104 small mines account for only 2% of the total coal output) and are marked by an exceedingly low productivity of labour. 
 On the other hand, the 37 largestmines employ nearly r of the total number of workers and produce over 70% of the total coal output. 
 Produc-tivity of labour increases parallel with the increase inthe size of the mines, even irrespective of whether machinery is used or not (cf. 
, for example, categories V and III of mines, as to quantity of steam-power and output per worker). 
Concentration of production in the Donets Basin is steadilyincreasing: thus, in the four years 1882-1886, of 512 coalconsigners, 21 dispatched over 5,000 wagon-loads (i. 
e. 
,3 million poods) each, making 229,700 wagon-loads out *In 1882, over 62% of the locomotives were fuelled with wood; in 1895-96, however, wood fuelled 28.

 After capturing the home market, the oil industry went in quest of foreign markets, and the export of oil to Asia is growing very rapidly ( Vestnik Finansov , 1897, No. 
 32) in spite of the a priori predictions of certain Russianeconomists who love to talk about the absence of foreign marketsfor Russian capitalism.

 In the four years 1891-1895, however, there were 872 consigners, of whom 55 dispatched over 5,000 wagon-loads each, making 925,400 wagon-loads out of 1,178,000, i.

 * The foregoing data on the development of the mining industry are particularly important in two respects: first-ly, they reveal with exceptional clarity the essence of the change in social-economic relations that is taking place in Russia in all spheres of the national economy; secondly,they illustrate the theoretical proposition that in adeveloping capitalist society there is a particularly rapidgrowth of those branches of industry which produce means of production , i. 
e. 
, articles not of personal, but of pro-ductive, consumption. 
 The replacement of one form of social economy by another is particularly clear in the miningindustry, because here the typical representatives of the twoforms are distinct areas. 
 In one area there is the oldpre-capitalist world, with its primitive, routine technique,personal dependence of a population tied to place of resi-dence, firmly established social-estate traditions, monop-olies, etc. 
; while in the other area one finds a completebreak with all tradition, a technical revolution, and therapid growth of purely capitalist machine industry. 
 ** This example brings out in bold relief the mistake of the Narod-nik economists. 
 They deny the progressive nature of capi-talism in Russia, pointing to the fact that in agriculture our entrepreneurs readily resort to labour-service and inindustry to the distribution of home work and that inmining they seek to secure the tying down of theworker, legislative prohibition of competition by small *From data of N. 
 S.

 **Latterly the Urals, too, have begun to change under the influence of the new conditions of life; and this change will be still more rapidwhen the Urals are tied closer to “Russia” by railway lines. 
 Of partic-ular importance in this respect will be the proposed connection byrail of the Urals and the South with a view to the exchange of Uraliron-ore for Donets coal.

 establishments, etc. 
, etc. 
 The illogicality of such arguments and their flagrant distortion of historical perspective are glaring. 
 Whence, indeed, does it follow that the efforts of our entrepreneurs to utilise the advantages of pre-capitalistmethods of production should be charged to our capitalism,and not to those survivals of the past which retard the devel-opment of capitalism and which in many cases are preservedby force of law? Can one be surprised, for instance, at the southern mine owners being eager to tie the workers down and to secure the legislative prohibition of competitionby small establishments, when in the other mining areasuch tying down and such prohibitions have existed forages, and exist to this day, and when in another area theironmasters, by using more primitive methods and employ-ing cheaper and more docile labour, get a profit on their pig-iron, without effort, of “kopek per kopek and sometimeseven one and a half kopeks per kopek”? * Should we not, on the contrary, be surprised at the fact that, under thesecircumstances, there are people who are capable of idealis-ing the pre-capitalist economic order in Russia, and who shut their eyes to the most urgent and pressing necessity of abolishing all obsolete institutions that hinder thedevelopment of capitalism? ** On the other hand, the data on the growth of the min-ing industry are important because they clearly reveal amore rapid growth of capitalism and of the home market on account of articles of productive consumption than on account of articles of personal consumption. 
 This circum-stance is ignored by Mr. 
 N. 
 —on, for instance, who argues that the satisfaction of the entire home demand for theproducts of the mining industry “will probably take placevery soon” ( Sketches , 123). 
 The fact is that the consumption of metals, coal, etc. 
 (per inhabitant), does not and cannot remain stationary in capitalist society, but necessarily *Article by Yegunov in Reports and Investigations of Handi-craft Industry , Vol. 
 III, p. 
 130. 
 **For example, Mr. 
 N. 
 —on levelled all his complaints solely against capitalism (cf. 
, in particular, his observations on the southern mine owners, Sketches , pp. 
 211 and 296) and thus utterly distorted the relation between Russian capitalism and the pre-capitalist struc-ture of our mining industry. 
 increases . 
 Every new mile of railway, every new workshop, every iron plough acquired by a rural bourgeois increases the demand for the products of ore-mining. 
 Although from 1851 to 1897 the consumption of pig-iron, for example, inRussia increased from 14 pounds per head to 1 3 poods, even this latter amount will have to increase very consider-ably before it approaches the size of the demand for pig-iron in the advanced countries (in Belgium and England it is over 6 poods per inhabitant). 
 V. 
 IS THE NUMBER OF WORKERS IN LARGE CAPITALIST ENTERPRISES GROWING? Having examined the statistics of the factory and mining industries, we can now attempt to answer this question, one which has so much engaged the attention ofthe Narodnik economists, and which they have answeredin the negative (Messrs. 
 V. 
 V. 
, N. 
 —on, Karyshev and Kablukov have asserted that the number of factoryworkers in Russia is increasing—if it is increasing— more slowly than the population). 
 Let us observe first of all that the question must be whether an increase is takingplace in the commercial and industrial population at theexpense of the agricultural population (of this below), orwhether an increase is taking place in the number ofworkers employed in large-scale machine industry. 
 It cannot be asserted that the number of workers in small industrialestablishments or in manufactories must increase in a developing capitalist society, for the factory constantly eliminates the more primitive forms of industry. 
 Ourfactory statistics, however, as was shown in detail above, do not always refer to the factory in the scientific sense of the term. 
 To examine the data on the question that interests us, we must take, firstly, the returns for all branches, and, secondly, the returns for a long period. 
 Only if we do thatis there a guarantee that the data will be more or less com-parable. 
 We take the years 1865 and 1890, a stretch of twenty-five years in the post-Reform period. 
 Let ussum up the available statistics. 
 The factory statistics give the fullest data for 1865; for European Russia they showed 380,638 factory workers in all trades except distilling, brewing, beet-sugar and tobacco. 
 * To determine the num-ber of workers in these trades, we have to take the only data available, those of the Military Statistical Abstract , which, as has been shown above, must be corrected. 
 By adding the127,935 workers in the trades mentioned, ** we get the total number of factory workers in European Russia in1865 (in excise-paying and non-excise-paying trades) as 508,573 . 
 *** For 1890 the corresponding figure will be 839,730 . 
**** The increase is 65%, much greater than the increase in population. 
 It must, however, be borne in mindthat actually the increase was undoubtedly bigger than these figures show : above it was demonstrated in detail that the factory statistics for the 1860s are exaggerated due to their inclusion of small handicraft, artisan and agricultural establishments, as well as home workers. 
Unfortunately, we are unable, for lack of material, to cor-rect all these exaggerations in full, and prefer not to correctthem in part, especially as more exact data will be givenbelow regarding the number of workers in large factories. 
 Let us pass to the mining and metallurgical statistics. 
 For 1865 the number of mine workers was given only for thecopper and iron trades, as well as the gold and platinumfields; for European Russia it was 133,176 . 
( *) In 1890, *Returns and Material of the Ministry of Finance , 1867, No. 
 6. 
 It has been shown above that for comparison with contemporarydata one can only take data from the same source, i. 
e. 
, those of the Ministry of Finance. 
 **The number of workers in brewing is 6,825, this figure is also exaggerated, but it cannot be corrected for lack of data; in beet-sugar making—68,334 (according to The Ministry of Finance Year-book ); tobacco-making—6,116 (corrected) and distilling—46,660 (corrected). 
 *** Mr. 
 Tugan-Baranovsky quotes for 1866 the figure given by Mr. 
 Veshnyakov—493,371 ( The Factory , p. 
 339). 
 We do not know how this figure was arrived at; it differs very slightly from the one wegive. 
 **** According to the Directory for 1890. 
 From the total of 875,764 we have to subtract the number of workers duplicated inmining statistics, viz. 
, 291 in asphalt, 3,468 in salt, and 32,275 in rails production. 
 ( *) For the number of mine workers in the 60s, see Statistical Chronicle , I, 1866; The Ministry of Finance Yearbook , I; Statistical Returns for Mining , for 1864-1867, St. 
 Petersburg, 1864-1867, pub-lished by the Mining Scientific Committee. 
 there were in the same trades 274,748 workers ,* i. 
e. 
, more than twice as many . 
 The latter figure represents 80. 
6% of the total number of mine workers in European Russia in 1890; if we assume that in 1865 the trades mentioned alsocovered 80. 
6% of the total mine workers, ** we get the total number of mine workers for 1865 as 165,230 and for 1890 as 340,912. 
 An increase of 107%. 
 Further, railway workers also belong to the category of workers in big capitalist enterprises. 
 In 1890, in European Russia, together with Poland and the Caucasus, they num-bered 252,415. 
 *** The figure for 1865 is unknown, but it can be determined with a sufficient degree of approxima-tion, since the number of railway workers employed perverst of railway fluctuates very slightly. 
 Counting 9 workers per verst, we get the total number of railway workers in 1865 as 32,076. 
 **** *Statistical Returns for the Mining and Metallurgical Industries in 1890 , St. 
 Petersburg, 1892. 
 According to this source the total for European Russia is 342,166, and if we subtract the numberof workers at the kerosene refineries (included in the Directory ) and correct certain minor errors, the total will be 340,912. 
 **Among the other branches of mining industries there are some in which the number of workers has probably increased slightly(salt mining), there are some in which the number must have increasedvery considerably (coal-mining, stone-quarrying), and some whichdid not exist at all in the 1860s (such as quicksilver-mining). 
 *** Statistical Survey of Railways and Inland Waterways , St. 
 Petersburg, 1893, p. 
 22. 
 Published by Ministry of Communications. 
Unfortunately, we lack the data to separate European Russia. 
 Underrailway workers we include, not only permanent, but temporary(10,447) and day labourers (74,504). 
 The average annual pay of atemporary worker is 192 rubles, and of a day labourer 235 rubles. 
 The average daily pay is 78 kopeks. 
 Consequently, both the tempo-rary and the day workers are engaged for the greater part of the year,so that to disregard them, as Mr. 
 N. 
 —on does ( Sketches , p. 
 124), is wrong. 
 **** The number of workers per verst employed on the railways in 1886 was 9. 
0, in 1890—9. 
5; in 1893—10. 
2 in 1894—10. 
6; in 1895— 10. 
9; thus the number obviously tends to grow. 
 See Returns for Russia for 1890 and 1896, and Vestnik Finansov , 1897, No. 
 39. 
—Let us make the reservation that in this section we are concerned exclusively withcomparing the data for 1865 and 1890, it is therefore absolutelyimmaterial whether we take the number of railway workers for the wholeof the Empire or only for European Russia; whether we take 9 workers per verst or fewer, or whether we take all branches of mining or only those for which data exist for 1865. 
 Let us sum up our calculations. 
 Number of workers in large capitalist enterprises (in thousands) YearsIn factory In OnTotalindustry mining railways 1865 509 165 32 706 1890 840 340 252 1,432 Thus, in 25 years the number of workers in large capital-ist enterprises more than doubled, i. 
e. 
, it increased notonly much faster than the population in general, but even faster than the urban population. 
 * The steadily increasing diversion of workers from agriculture and from the smallindustries to big industrial enterprises is consequentlybeyond doubt. 
 ** This is indicated by the very statistics that are so often resorted to and abused by our Narodniks. 
 But theculminating point of their abuse of the statistics is the fol-lowing truly phenomenal device: they work out the propor-tion of factory workers to the total population (!) and on the basis of the figure arrived at (about 1%) expa-tiate on how insignificant this “handful” *** of workers is! Mr. 
 Kablukov, for example, after repeating the calculation of *In European Russia the urban population in 1863 was 6. 
1 million, and in 1897, 12. 
0 million. 
 **The latest data on the number of workers in large capitalist enterprises are as follows for 1900 data exist regarding the number of factory workers in non-excise-paying enterprises; for 1903, data areavailable for excise-paying enterprises. 
 On workers in the mining andmetallurgical industries data exist for 1902. 
 The number of railwayworkers may be determined by reckoning 11 men per verst (informa-tion as of January 1, 1904). 
 See Yearbook of Russia , 1906, and Returns for the Mining and Metallurgical Industries , for 1902. 
 Summing up these data, we get the following: in the 50 gubernias of European Russia in 1900-1903 there were 1,261,571 factory workers;477,025 mining workers; 468,941 railway workers. 
 Total, 2,207,537. 
In the entire Russian Empire there were 1,509,516 factory workers,626,929 mining workers, 655,929 railway workers. 
 Total, 2,792,374. 
 These figures, too, fully bear out what is said in the text.

, 326 and others. 
 the proportion of “factory workers in Russia” * to the population, goes on to say: “In the West, however (!!), the number of workers engaged in manufacturing industry . 
 . 
 . 
” (is it not obvious to every schoolboy that “factory workers”and “workers engaged in manufacturing industry” are notone and the same thing at all?) . 
 . 
 . 
 “constitute quite a differ-ent proportion of the population,” namely, from 53% inBritain to 23% in France. 
 “It is not difficult to see that the difference in the proportion of the class of factory workers (!!) there and here is so great that it is out of the question toidentify the course of our development with that of West-ern Europe. 
” And this is written by a professor and special-ist in statistics! With extraordinary valour he perpetratestwo misrepresentations at one blow: 1) factory workers are replaced by workers engaged in manufacturing industry, and 2) the latter are replaced by the population engaged in manufacturing industry. 
 Let us explain the meaning of these categories to our learned statisticians. 
 In France, according to the census of 1891, the workers engaged in manufacturing industry numbered 3. 
3 million—less than one-tenth of the population (36. 
8 million classified according to occupation;and 1. 
3 million not classified according to occupation). 
 These are workers employed in all industrial establishments and enterprises, and not only factory workers. 
 The popula-tion, however, that is engaged in manufacturing industry numbered 9. 
5 million (about 26% of the total population). 
 Added here to the number of workers are employers, etc. 
 (1 million); then office employees, clerks, etc. 
, 0. 
2 million; dependents in household , 4. 
8 million; and domestic servants, 0. 
2 million. 
 ** To illustrate the corresponding proportions in Russia, we must take particular centres as our examples, for we have no statistics showing the occupations of the whole population. 
 Let us take one urban and one rural centre. 
 In Petersburg the factory statistics for 1890 gave the number of factory workers as 51,760 (according to the Directory ), whereas according to the St. 
 Petersburg census of December 15, 1890, the number of persons of both sexes *Lectures on Agricultural Economics , Moscow, 1897, p. 
 14. 
 **The Statesman’s Yearbook , 1897, p. 
 472. 
 engaged in manufacturing industry was 341,991, distrib-uted as follows: * Number of persons of both sexes Members of Independent families and (i.

 Let these figures give food for thought to Messrs. 
 N. 
 —on, Kablukov and Co.

6 Needless to say, these data fully confirm what has been said above regarding the absurdity of the Narodnik deviceof comparing the number of factory workers with the wholepopulation. 
 It will be interesting, first of all, to group the data on the occupational distribution of the whole population of Russia, in a way that will illustrate the division of social labour as the basis of the whole of commodity pro-duction and capitalism in Russia. 
 From this point of view,the entire population should be distributed into threelarge subdivisions: I. 
 Agricultural. 
 II. 
 Commercial andindustrial. 
 III. 
 Unproductive (more precisely, not par-ticipating in economic activity). 
 Of the nine groups given (a to i), only one cannot be directly and entirely assigned to any one of these three main subdivisions. 
 Thatis group g: private service, domestic servants and day labourers. 
 This group has to be distributed approximately between the commercial-and-industrial and the agricul-tural population. 
 We have assigned to the former the section of this group which is shown as residing in towns (2. 
5 million), and to the latter those residing in rural areas (3. 
3 million). 
 We then get the following picture of the dis-tribution of the total population of Russia: Agricultural population of Russia ...... 97. 
0 million Commercial and industrial ......... 21. 
7 ” Unproductive ............... 6. 
9 ” Total ....... 
 125. 
6 million This picture clearly shows, on the one hand, that com-modity circulation and, hence, commodity production arefirmly implanted in Russia. 
 Russia is a capitalist country. 
On the other hand, it follows from this that Russia is stillvery backward, as compared with other capitalist coun-tries, in her economic development. 
 To proceed. 
 After the analysis we have made in the present work, the statistics of the occupations of the wholepopulation of Russia can and should be used to determineapproximately the main categories into which the entire population of Russia is divided according to class status, i. 
e. 
, according to their status in the social system of pro-duction. 
 It is possible to determine these categories—only approx-imately, of course—because we know the main economicgroups into which the peasantry are divided. 
 And theentire mass of the agricultural population of Russia may safelybe regarded as peasants, for the number of landlords in the sum-total is quite negligible. 
 Quite a considerable section of landlords, moreover, are included in the category ofrentiers, government officials, high dignitaries, etc. 
 Inthe peasant mass of 97 millions, however, one must distin-guish three main groups: the bottom group—the proletar-ian and semi-proletarian strata of the population; the middle group—the poor small peasant farmers; and the top group— the well-to-do small peasant farmers. 
 We have analysedabove the main economic features of these groups as dis-tinct class elements. 
 The bottom group is the propertyless population, which earns its livelihood mainly, or half ofit, by the sale of labour-power . 
 The middle group comprises the poor small peasant farmers, for the middle peasant in the best of years just barely manages to make ends meet, but the principal means of livelihood of this group is “independent” (supposedly independent, of course) small-scale farming . 
 Finally, the top group consists of the well-to-do small peasant farmers, who exploit more or lessconsiderable numbers of allotment-holding farm labourersand day labourers and all sorts of wage-labourers ingeneral. 
 These groups constitute approximately 50%, 30% and 20% respectively of the total. 
 Above we invariably took theshare of each group in the total number of households orfarms. 
 Now we shall take them as a proportion of the popula-tion. 
 This change effects an increase in the bottom groupand a decrease in the top one. 
 But this, undoubtedly, is precisely the change that has taken place in Russia in the past decade, as is proved incontrovertibly by the declinein horse-ownership and by the ruin of the peasantry, thegrowth of poverty and unemployment in the rural districts,etc. 
 That is to say, among the agricultural population we have about 48. 
5 million proletarians and semi-proletarians; about 29. 
1 million poor small peasant farmers and theirfamilies, and about 19. 
4 million of the population on thewell-to-do small farms. 
 Now the question is how to distribute the commercial and industrial and the unproductive population. 
 The latter group contains sections of the population who obviously belong to the big bourgeoisie: all the rentiers (“living onincome from capital and real estate”—first subdivisionof group 14 in our statistics: 900,000), then part of thebourgeois intelligentsia, the high military and civil offi-cials, etc. 
 Altogether, these will number about 1 2 million. 
 At the opposite pole of this group of unproductive popula-tion are the lower ranks of the army, navy, gendarmerie andpolice (about 1. 
3 million), domestics and numerous serv-ants (about 2 million altogether), nearly 2 million beg-gars, tramps, etc. 
, etc. 
 Here we can only roughly distributethe groups that most closely approximate to the main eco-nomic types: about 2 million will go to the proletarian and semi-proletarian population (partly lumpen-proletarians),about 1. 
9 million to the poor small proprietors, and about 1. 
5 million to the well-to-do small proprietors, including the bulk of the clerks, managerial personnel, bourgeois intellectuals, etc. 
 Lastly, among the commercial and industrial population the largest section is undoubtedly the proletariat, and thegulf is widest between the proletariat and the big bourgeoi-sie. 
 But the census returns supply no data as to the distri-bution of this section of the population into employers, one-man producers, workers, etc. 
 We have no alternative but to take as a model the above-quoted data on the indus-trial population of St. 
 Petersburg, classified according toposition in production. 
 On the basis of these data we mayroughly assign about 7% to the big bourgeoisie, 10% tothe well-to-do petty bourgeoisie, 22% to the poor small pro-prietors and 61% to the proletariat. 
 In Russia as a whole, small production in industry is, of course, much more tena-cious than it is in St. 
 Petersburg, but then we do not assignto the semi-proletarian population the mass of one-man pro-ducers and handicraftsmen who work in their homes formasters. 
 Hence, on the whole, the proportions taken will in all probability not differ very much from what they actual-ly are. 
 For the commercial and industrial population weshall then get about 1. 
5 million big bourgeoisie, about 2. 
2million well-to-do, about 4. 
8 million needy small producers,and about 13. 
2 million belonging to the proletarian andsemi-proletarian strata of the population. 
 By combining the agricultural, commercial and indus-trial, and unproductive sections of the population, we shallget the following approximate distribution of the entirepopulation of Russia according to class status: Total population, both sexes Big bourgeoisie, landlords, high offi-ials, etc .............

 See further on. 
 We have no doubt that our Cadet and quasi-Cadet econ-omists and politicians will raise their voices in indignation against this “over-simplified” concept of the economyof Russia. 
 After all, it is so convenient, so advantageous to gloss over the profundity of economic contradic-tions in a detailed analysis and at the same time tocomplain of the “crudity” of socialist views on these contradictions as a whole . 
 Such criticism of the conclusion we have reached is, of course, without scientificvalue. 
 Differences of opinion are, of course, possible about the degree of approximation of various figures. 
 It is of interest to note, from this point of view, the work of Mr. 
 Lositsky, Studies of the Population of Russia Based on the Census of 1897 (Mir Bozhy ,* 1905, No. 
 8). 
 The author took the bare census figures of the number of workers and servants, and from these estimated the proletarian population in Russia at 22 million; the peasant and land-owning population at 80 mil-lion, employers and clerks in commerce and industry at about 12 million, and the population not engaged in industry at about 12 million. 
 The number of proletarians according to these figures comes quite close to the figure we have arrived at. 
 ** To deny the existence of a vast mass of semi-proletarians amongthe poor peasants who are dependent upon “employments,” among the handicraftsmen, etc. 
, would be to scoff at all the data on the Russian economy. 
 One need but recall the3 4 million horseless households in European Russia alone, the 3. 
4 million one-horse households, the sum-total of Zemstvo statistics on rented land, “employments,” budgets,etc. 
, to abandon all doubt about the huge size of the semi-proletarian population. 
 To agree that the proletarian and semi-proletarian population taken together comprisesone-half of the peasantry is probably no understate-ment and no exaggeration of its numbers. 
 And outside *Wide World . 
—Ed. 
 **This is not the place to go into d etails concerning the statistics on workers and servants used by Mr. 
 Lositsky. 
 These statistics evidently err in very considerably understating the number of workers. 
 of the agricultural population, the proletarians and semi-proletarians undoubtedly constitute a still higher percentage. 
 Further, if we are not to replace the complete economic picture by petty details, we should include among the well-to-do small proprietors a considerable section of thecommercial and industrial managerial personnel, clerks, bourgeois intellectuals, government officials, and so on. 
 Here we have perhaps been too cautious and fixed the number ofthis group of the population too high: it is quite possible that we-should have put the poor small proprietors at a higher figure and the well-to-do at a lower. 
 But, ofcourse, in making such divisions one does not lay claim to absolute statistical accuracy. 
 Statistics should illustrate the socio-economic relations established by an all-round analysis, and not be made an end in themselves, as too often happens in our country. 
 To gloss over the large numbers of the petty-bourgeoisstrata in the population of Russia would be simply to fal-sify the picture of our real economic situation. 
 VI. 
 STEAM-ENGINE STATISTICS The employment of steam-engines in production is one of the most characteristic features of large-scale machine industry. 
 It will be interesting therefore to examine thedata available on this subject. 
 For the years 1875-1878 the number of steam-engines is supplied by Material for the Statistics of Steam-Engines in the Russian Empire (St. 
 Petersburg, 1882. 
 Published by the Central Statisti-cal Committee). 
 * For 1892 we have the figures of Collection of Data on Factory Industry , which cover all factory and mining trades. 
 Here are these data compared: *Of the 13 groups of trades we omit, for purposes of comparison with 1892, the following groups: I (agriculture), XII (printing and lithography) and XIII (“plumbing,” etc. 
). 
 Locomobiles are counted with steam-engines.

p. 
 capacity of steam-engines in Russia increased threefold and in European Russia 22 times . 
 The number of steam-engines increased to a lesser degree, so that the average capacity per steam-engine rose considerably: in European Russia from 18 h. 
p. 
 to 24 h. 
p. 
, and in the Kingdom of Poland from 18 h. 
p. 
 to 41 h. 
p. 
 Large-scale machine industry, consequently, developed very rap-idly during this period. 
 As regards steam-power capacity,the following gubernias, in 1875-1878, were in the lead: St. 
 Petersburg (17,808 h. 
p. 
), Moscow (13,668), Kiev(8,363), Perm (7,348) and Vladimir (5,684)—the total for these five gubernias being 52,871 h. 
p. 
 or about r of the total for European Russia. 
 Then follow the Podolsk (5,480), Petrokov (5,071) and Warsaw (4,760) gubernias. 
 In 1892 the order changed: Petrokov (59,063), St. 
 Petersburg (43,961), Ekaterinoslav (27,839), Moscow (24,704), Vladimir (15,857) and Kiev (14,211)—the total for the last five gubernias being 126,572 h. 
p. 
, or nearly 2 the total for European Russia. 
 Then follow the gubernias of Warsaw (11,310) and Perm (11,245). 
 These figures clearly indicate the forma-tion of two new industrial centres: in Poland and in the South. 
 In Petrokov Gubernia, the total capacity increased 11. 
6-fold, and in the Ekaterinoslav and Don gubernias taken together, * from 2,834 to 30,932 h. 
p. 
 or 10. 
9-fold. 
 These industrial centres, which have grown so rapidly, *We combine these gubernias because their boundaries have have moved up from the bottom to the top places and have supplanted the old industrial centres. 
 Let us observe that these data, too, reveal the particularly rapid growth of the indus-tries producing articles of productive consumption, namely, the mining and metallurgical industries. 
 In 1875-78 theseindustries employed 1,040 steam-engines with a total of22,966 h. 
p. 
 (in European Russia) and in 1890 1,960 steam-engines with a total of 74,204 h. 
p. 
, i. 
e. 
, an increase in 14 years that exceeds the increase in the total number of steam-engines in industry as a whole in 16 years. 
 The industriesproducing means of production constitute an ever-growingpart of industry as a whole. 
 * VII. 
 THE GROWTH OF LARGE FACTORIES The unsatisfactory nature of our factory statistics, as demonstrated above, has compelled us to resort to morecomplex calculations in order to determine the developmentof large-scale machine industry in Russia since the Reform. 
We have selected data for 1866, 1879, 1890 and 1894-95 on the largest factories, namely, those with 100 and more workers per establishment. 
 ** Outside workers are strictly separated only in the data of the List for 1894-95; *The progress made in the employment of steam-engines in Russia since 1892 may be seen from the fact that in 1904, according tothe factory inspectors’ reports, there were in 64 gubernias 27,579 factory steam-boilers; the total, not including those employed in agriculture, was 31,887. 
 ( Note to 2nd edition . 
) **Sources: The Ministry of Finance Yearbook , I (data only for 71 trades); Directories , first and third editions—data for all trades, as well as those in the List ; but for a comparison of the data in the List and in the Directory , the manufacture of rails must be omitted from the trades given in the latter establishments for which home workers were included among the factory workers are omitted. 
 In some casesthe inclusion of home workers is specifically indicated in footnotesin the publications mentioned; in others the fact emerges from a com-parison of the data for different years: cf. 
, for instance, the data oncotton weaving in Saratov Gubernia for 1879, 1890, and 1894-95.

 We give the returns on these largest factories (p. 
 510). 
Let us commence our analysis of this table with the data for the years 1866, 1879 and 1890. 
 The total numberof large factories changed during these years as follows:644, 852, 951, or in percentages: 100, 132, 147. 
 In the course of 24 years the number of large factories increased, conse-quently, by nearly fifty per cent. 
 Moreover, if we take thedata for the different categories of large factories, we shallsee that the larger the factories, the faster their numbergrows (A: 512, 641, 712 factories; B: 90, 130, 140; C: 42, 81,99). 
 This indicates a growing concentration of production. 
 The number of mechanised establishments grows more rap-idly than the total number of factories; in percentages asfollows: 100, 178, 226. 
 An increasing number of large facto-ries introduce steam-engines. 
 The larger the factories, thegreater the number of mechanised establishments amongthem; if we calculate the percentage of these establishments to the total number of factories in the given category, we obtain the following: A) 39%, 53%, 63%; B) 75%, 91%, 100%;C) 83%, 94%, 100%. 
 The employment of steam-engines isclosely bound up with the expansion of the volume of out-put, with the expansion of co-operation in production. 
 The number of workers in all large factories changed in percentages as follows: 100, 168, 200. 
 During the 24 years the number of workers doubled, i. 
e. 
, exceeded theincrease in the total number of “factory workers. 
” Theaverage number of workers per large factory was by years:359, 458, 488, and by categories: A) 213, 221, 220; B) 665,706, 673; C) 1,495, 1,935, 2,154. 
 An increasing number of workers are thus being concentrated in the largest factories. 
 In 1866, factories with 1,000 workers and over employed27% of the total number of workers in large factories;in 1879, 40%; in 1890, 46%. 
 The change in the output of all large factories expressed in percentages will be: 100, 243, 292; and by categories: A) 100, 201, 187; B) 100, 245, 308; C) 100, 323, 479. 
 Hence, the volume of output of all large factories increased almostthreefold, and the larger the factory, the more rapid the increase. 
 But if we compare the productivity of labour for each separate year according to the different categories, we shallget a somewhat different picture. 
 The average output perworker in all large factories will be: 866 rubles, 1,250,1,260; and by categories: A) 901, 1,410, 1,191; B) 800, 1,282,1,574; C) 841, 1,082, 1,188. 
 Thus, for each separate year weobserve no increase in output (per worker) as we pass fromthe bottom category to the top. 
 This is because the variouscategories include, in unequal proportions, factories in indus-tries using raw materials of different value and obtaining,therefore, an annual output per worker of different value. 
 * We do not think it worth while to examine in equal detail the data for the years 1879-1890 and for the years1879-1890-1894-1895, since this would mean repeating allthat has been said above for somewhat different percentages. 
 Latterly, the Collection of Factory Inspectors ’ Reports has supplied data on the distribution of factories and worksinto groups according to the number of workers employed. 
Here are the data for 1903: In 64 gubernias of In 50 gubernias of Russia European Russia154 Groups of No.

 At allevents, they show that the number of large factories (thosewith over 99 or over 100 workers) and the number of workersemployed in them are rapidly increasing. 
 The concentrationof workers and, consequently, of production, also increasesin the largest of these large factories. 
 Comparing the data on the large factories with those on all “factories and works” given in our of official statistics, *Thus, in 1866, category A included 17 sugar-refineries, where the average annual output per worker was about 6,000 rubles, whereas in the textile factories (included in the top categories) the average we see that in 1879 the large factories, constituting 4. 
4% of all “factories and works” concentrated 66. 
8% of the total number of factory workers and 54. 
8% of the total output. 
 In 1890 they constituted 6. 
7% of the total number of“factories and works,” and concentrated 71. 
1% of allfactory workers and 57. 
2% of the total output. 
 In1894-95 they constituted 10. 
1% of all “factories andworks,” and concentrated 74% of all factory workers and 70. 
8% of the total output. 
 In 1903, the large factories in European Russia, those with over 100 workers,constituted 17% of the total number of factories and worksand concentrated 76. 
6% of the total number of factoryworkers. 
 * Thus, the large, mostly steam-powered, factories, despite their small numbers, concentrate an overwhelming and ever-growing proportion of the workers and output of all “factories and works. 
” The tremendous rapidity with whichthese large factories have been growing in the post-Reformperiod has already been noted. 
 Let us now cite data on theequally large enterprises in the mining industry.

 Studies , p. 
 276 (See present edition, Vol. 
 4 “On the Question of Our Factory Statis-tics. 
 ”—Ed. 
)]. 
 We would point out that the rise in the percentage of large factories in the total number of “factories and works” indicatesabove all that this latter term is gradually acquiring a more restrictedmeaning in our statistics. 
 In the mining industry the concentration of workers in large enterprises is still greater (although the percentage of enterprises employing steam-engines is smaller); 258,000 workers out of 305,000, i. 
e. 
, 84. 
5%, are concentrated in enterprises with 100 and more workers; almost half of the mine workers (145,000 out of 305,000) are employed in a few very large establishments each employing 1,000 and more workers. 
 And of the total number of factory and mining workers in European Russia (1,180,000 in 1890), three-fourths (74. 
6%) are concentrated in enterprises employing 100 workers and over; nearly half (570,000 out of 1,180,000) are concentrated in enterprises each employing 500 and more workers. 
 * We think it worth while to deal here with the question raised by Mr. 
 N. 
 —on concerning a “slowing down” of the development of capitalism and of the growth of the “factory population” in the period of 1880-1890, as comparedwith that of 1865-1880. 
 ** From this remarkable discovery Mr. 
 N. 
 —on contrived, thanks to the original logic that dis-tinguishes him, to draw the conclusion that “the facts fully confirm” the assertion made in Sketches that “capitalism, after reaching certain limits of its development, effects a shrinkage of its own home market. 
”—Firstly, it is absurd to argue that a “slowing down in the rate of increase” indi-the Mining and Metallurgical Industries in 1890 , enterprises enu-merated in the Directory having been excluded. 
 By this exclusion, the total number of mining workers in European Russia is reducedby 35,000 (340,000-35,000=305,000). 
 *The industrial census for 1895 for the whole of German industry, including mine development, which is not registered in Russia, recorded a total of 248 establishments with 1,000 and more work-ers; the aggregate number of workers in these establishments was430,286. 
 Hence, the largest factories in Russia are larger than those inGermany. 
 **Russkoye Bogatstvo , 1894, No. 
 6, p. 
 101 and foll. 
 The data for large factories which we have given above also indicate a lower percentage of growth in 1879-1890 as compared with 1866-1879. 
 cates a shrinkage of the home market. 
 If the number of factory workers is growing faster than the population (and this is precisely the case according to Mr. 
 N. 
 —on’s own data; an increase between 1880 and 1890 of 25%), this shows that the population is being diverted from agriculture and that the home market is growing even for articles of personal consumption. 
 (We say nothing of the market for means of production. 
) Secondly, a “decline in the growth,” expressed in percentages always has to take place in a capitalist country at a certain stage of development, for small magnitudes always grow faster, in percentages, than big ones. 
 The only deduction one can draw from the fact that the initial steps in the development of capitalism are particularly rapid is that the young country is striving to overtake the older ones. 
 It is wrong, however, to take the percentage increase in the initial period as a standard for subsequent periods. 
 Thirdly, the fact itself of a “decline in the growth ” is not proved at all by comparing the periods taken by Mr. 
 N. 
 —on . 
 The development of capitalist indus-try cannot proceed except in cycles; therefore, to compare different periods, one must take data for a whole number ofyears, * so that the particularly prosperous, boom years and the slump years may stand out distinctly. 
 Mr. 
 N. 
 —on did not do this and slipped into profound error, for he over-looked the fact that the year 1880 was a high boom year. 
 Moreover, Mr. 
 N. 
 —on did not even hesitate to “concoct” the opposite assertion. 
 “We must also note,” he argues, “that the intervening year (between 1865 and 1890) of 1880 was a year of crop failure, so that the number of workers registered in that year was below the normal”!! (ibid. 
, pp. 
 103-104). 
 Mr. 
 N. 
 —on had only to glance at the text of the very publication from which he plucked the figures for 1880 ( Directory , 3rd edition), to read there that 1880 was marked by a “spurt” in industry, particularly in leather and machine building (p. 
 IV), and that this was due to the enhanced demand for goods after the war and to increased government orders. 
 It is sufficient to look through the *As Mr. 
 Tugan-Baranovsky, for example, did in his Factory , p. 
 307 and chart. 
 The chart clearly shows that 1879, and especially1880 and 1881, were years of particular boom. 
 Directory for 1879 to get a clear idea of the extent of this spurt. 
 * But Mr. 
 N. 
 —on does not hesitate completely to distort the facts to suit his romantic theory. 
 VIII. 
 THE OF LARGE-SCALE INDUSTRY Besides the concentration of production in very large establishments, the concentration of production in separate factory industrial centres and the different types of factorycentres are also important in characterising large-scalemachine industry. 
 Unfortunately, our factory statisticsnot only supply unsatisfactory and incomparable material,but arrange it in a far from adequate manner. 
 For example, in contemporary publications the distribution of industry is shown only by gubernias (and not by towns anduyezds as was done in the best publications of the 60s,which, in addition, illustrated the distribution of factoryindustry with maps). 
 But in order to present an accuratepicture of the distribution of large-scale industry, the data must be taken for separate centres, i. 
e. 
, for separate towns, industrial settlements, or groups of industrial settlementssituated close together; gubernias or uyezds are too bigas territorial units. 
 ** In view of this, we thought it *See, for instance, felt cloth production—increased output of army cloth; tanning—enormous activity, leather goods—a largefactory produces goods to the amount of 2. 
5 million rubles “for theWar Department” (p. 
 288). 
 The Izhevsk and the Sestroretsk worksturn out artillery supplies to the value of 7 2 million rubles, as against 1 4 million rubles in 1890. 
 In copper-working one notes the production of supplies for the troops and of military instruments pp. 
 388-389); explosive factories work at full capacity, etc. 
 **“... In the uyezds (of Moscow Gubernia) the factories and works are far from evenly distributed: in highly industrialised uyezds,side by side with localities which, because of the more or less consid-erable concentration there of factory establishments, can be called real factory centres, one comes across entire volosts almost wholly devoid of factory industry; and, on the contrary, in uyezds generallypoor in factories and works, there are districts with a more or lessconsiderable development of one industry or another; side by sidewith handicraft cottages and workrooms larger establishments havearisen possessing all the attributes of large-scale production.

 IV, Sec. 
 1, Moscow, 1890, p. 
 141. 
) This publication, the advisable to compute from the Directory for 1879 and 1890 data on the concentration of our factory industry in the most important centres. 
 The table given in the appendix (Appendix III) contains data for 103 factory centres inEuropean Russia, centres in which about half the totalnumber of factory workers are concentrated. 
 * The table shows three main types of factory centres in Russia. 
 1) The towns. 
 These take first place, being distin-guished for the greatest concentration of both workers and establishments. 
 Particularly outstanding in this respectare the large towns. 
 In each of the metropolitan cities(including the suburbs) about 70,000 factory workers areconcentrated; Riga has 16,000, Ivanovo-Voznesensk 15,000and Bogorodsk had 10,000 in 1890; the other towns have fewer than 10,000 each. 
 It is sufficient to take a cursory glance at the official figures on factory workers in severallarge cities (Odessa—8,600 in 1890, Kiev—6,000, Rostov-on-Don—5,700, etc. 
) to be convinced that these figuresare ridiculously low. 
 The instance of St. 
 Petersburg givenabove shows how many times these figures would have to be multiplied for the correct number of industrial workers in these centres to be obtained. 
 In addition to the towns, thesuburbs must also be indicated. 
 The suburbs of large townsare very often big industrial centres, but from the datawe possess we have been able to separate only one such centre, the suburbs of St. 
 Petersburg, where in 1890 thenumber of workers was 18,900. 
 Several of the settle-ments in the Moscow Uyezd included in our table are also actually suburbs. 
 ** best in contemporary factory statistical literature, illustrates the distribution of large-scale industry with the aid of a detailed map. 
 The only thing lacking for a complete picture of the distribution of factory industry is a classification of centres according to the numberof factories, workers and total output. 
 *The table includes only establishments with a minimum out-put of 2,000 rubles, and of the flour-mills only the steam-poweredones. 
 Outside workers are excluded wherever it has been stated that they are included among factory workers; such exclusions are indi-cated by an asterisk ( *). 
 The industrial boom of 1879 could not but affect these data, too. 
 **“... The large village of Cherkizovo in the vicinity of Moscow is, according to the local inhabitants, one large factory, and is a con-The second type of centre is the factory villages, which are particularly numerous in the Moscow, Vladimir and Kostroma gubernias (of the 63 most important rural centres included in our table, 42 are in these gubernias). 
 Thesecentres are headed by the township of Orekhovo-Zuyevo (inthe table, Orekhovo and Zuyevo are given separately, but theyare actually one centre); as to the number of workers, it comessecond only to the capitals (26,800 in 1890). 
 * In the three gubernias indicated, as also in the Yaroslavl and Tver gubernias, the majority of the rural factory centres areformed by huge textile mills (cotton-spinning and weaving,linen, wool-weaving, etc. 
). 
 Formerly, there were almostalways work-distributing offices in such villages, i. 
e. 
, centresof capitalist manufacture, which held sway over masses of neighbouring hand weavers. 
 In those cases where the statistics do not confuse home workers with factory workers,the data on the development of such centres clearly revealthe growth of large-scale machine industry which attractsthousands of peasants from the surrounding areas andtransforms them into factory workers. 
 Further, a consider-able number of rural factory centres are formed by large mining and metallurgical plants (Kolomna Works in thevillage of Bobrovo, Yuzovka Works, Bryansk Works, andothers); the majority of these are classified under mining,and for that reason were not included in our table. 
 The beet-sugar refineries situated in the villages and townships of the south-western gubernias also form quite a number of village factory centres; for our example we have taken oneof the largest, the township of Smela, in Kiev Gubernia. 
 tinuation of Moscow in the literal sense of the word.... 
 Nearby, beyond the Semyonovskaya Tollgate ... again a large number of diversefactories are clustered.... 
 At no great distance from here we see the village of Izmailovo, with its weaving sheds, and the enormous Izmailovo Textile Mill. 
” That is to the north of Moscow. 
 To the south,“beyond the Serpukhov Tollgate, what we meet first is the immense Danilov Textile Mill, in itself a whole township.... 
 Further on, at no great distance from each other, are a whole ring of large brick-works,” etc. 
 ( Statistical Returns , IV, Sec. 
 I, pp. 
 143-144). 
 Thus, the concentration of factory industry is actually more considerable than we were able to indicate in our table. 
 *In 1879, only 10,900 were recorded here. 
 Evidently, different methods of registration were employed. 
 The third type of factory centre is the “handicraft” villages, the largest establishments in which are often classified as “factories and works. 
” In our table, the villages of Pavlovo, Vorsma, Bogorodskoye and Dubovka serveas examples of such centres. 
 A comparison between thenumber of factory workers in such centres and the total oftheir industrial population was made above in the case ofBogorodskoye village. 
 If we group the centres given in our table according to number of workers in each centre and according to the type ofcentre (town or village), we get the following data (seenext page). 
 The table shows that in 1879 there were 356,000 workers (out of a total of 752,000) concentrated in these 103 centres, while in 1890 there were 451,000 (out of 876,000). 
 Accordingly, the number of workers increased by 26. 
8%,whereas in the large factories in general (of 100 andmore workers) the increase was only 22. 
2%, while the totalnumber of workers increased over this period by only 16. 
5%. 
Thus the workers are being concentrated in the largest centres. 
 In 1879, only 11 centres had over 5,000 workers; in 1890 there were 21. 
 Particularly striking is the increasein the number of centres with from 5,000 to 10,000 work-ers. 
 This occurred for two reasons: 1) because of the ex-ceptional growth of factory industry in the South (Odessa,Rostov-on-Don, etc. 
); and 2) because of the growth of the factory villages in the central gubernias A comparison between the urban and the rural centres shows that in 1890 the latter embraced about one-third o f the total number of workers in the leading centres (152,000out of 451,000). 
 For the whole of Russia this proportionshould be higher, i. 
e. 
, more than one-third of the factory workers must be outside of the towns. 
 Indeed, all the out-standing urban centres are included in our table, whereasrural centres with several hundred workers each, apart fromthose we have mentioned, exist in exceedingly large numbers(settlements with glass-works, brickworks, distilleries, beet-sugar refineries, etc. 
). 
 Mining workers are also to be found mainly outside of towns. 
 One may consider, therefore, that of the total number of factory and mining workers inEuropean Russia not less (and maybe more) than half are to Leading centres of factory industry in European Russia1879 1890 No.

 of workers be found outside of towns. 
 This conclusion is very important, for it shows that the industrial population in Russia greatly exceeds the urban population. 
 * If we now turn to the pace at which factory industry develops in urban and in rural centres, we see that it is undoubtedly faster in the latter. 
 The number of urban centres with 1,000 workers and over in the period taken grew very slightly (from 32 to 33), while the number of rural centres in this category grew very considerably (from 38 to 53). 
 The number of workers in the 40 urban centres grew by only 16. 
1 % (from 257,000 to 299,000), while in the 63 rural centres it grew by 54. 
7% (from 98,500 to 152,500). 
 The average number of workers per urban centre rose only from 6,400 to 7,500, whereas the average number per rural centre rose from 1,500 to 2,400. 
 Thus, factory industry evidently tends to spread with particular rapidity outside the towns, to create new factory centres and to push them forward faster than the urban centres, and to penetrate deep into remote rural areas that would seem to be isolated from the world of big capitalist enterprises. 
 This supremely important circumstance shows us, firstly,the rapidity with which large-scale machine industry trans-forms social and economic relationships. 
 What formerly took ages to take shape now springs up in a decade or so. 
 We have only to compare, for instance, the formation of such non-agricultural centres as the “handicraft villages” indicated in the previous chapter—Bogorodskoye, Pavlovo, Kimry, Khoteichi, Velikoye and others—with the process of the establishment of new centres by the modern factory, which at once draws the rural population by the thousands into industrial settlements. 
 ** Social division of labour *The population census of January 28, 1897, fully confirmed this conclusion. 
 The urban population throughout the Empire was given as 16,828,395 persons of both sexes. 
 The commercial and industrial population, as we showed above, is 21. 
7 millions. 
 ( Note to 2nd edition . 
) **“In the township of Krivoi Rog the population grew between 1887 and 1896 from 6,000 to 17,000, at the Kamenka Works of theDnieper Company—from 2,000 to 18,000; near Druzhkovka station, where as late as 1892 there was nothing but station buildings, there is now a settlement of 6,000 people; at the Gdantsevka Works there receives a tremendous impetus. 
 Mobility of the population replaces the former immobility and isolation as a necessary condition of economic life. 
 Secondly, the transfer of facto-ries into the rural districts shows that capitalism is surmount-ing the obstacles which the social-estate seclusion of thepeasant community creates for it, and is even derivingbenefit from this seclusion. 
 While the erection of facto-ries in the countryside involves quite a few inconveniences, it does, however, guarantee a supply of cheap labour. 
 The muzhik is not allowed to go to the factory, so the factorygoes to the muzhik. 
 * The muzhik lacks complete freedom (thanks to the collective-responsibility system and theobstacles to his leaving the community) to seek the employerwho gives the greatest advantage; but the employer has a perfect way of seeking out the cheapest worker. 
 Thirdly, the large number of rural factory centres and their rapidgrowth proves groundless the opinion that the Russianfactory is isolated from the mass of the peasantry, thatit exercises little influence over them. 
 The specific char-are nearly 3,500 people; near Konstantinovka station, where a number of works have been erected, a new settlement is being formed; Yuzovka is now a town with a population of 29,000.... 
 On the sandywasteland at Nizhne-Dnieprovsk, near Ekaterinoslav, where a numberof factories are now situated, a new settlement has sprung up witha population of 6,000. 
 The works at Mariupol has attracted a newpopulation of 10,000, etc. 
 Populated centres are springing up around the coal mines” ( Vestnik Finansov , 1897, No. 
 50). 
 According to the Russkiye Vedomosti (November 21, 1897, No. 
 322), the Bakhmut Uyezd Zemstvo Assembly has filed an application for the status oftownships to be granted to commercial settlements with a popula-tion of 1,000 and the status of towns to those with a population of5,000.... 
 “There is to be observed here ... an unparalleled growth of commercial and factory settlements.... 
 Altogether, there are by now as many as thirty settlements, which have been springing up andgrowing at a truly American pace.... 
 In Volyntsevo, where a hugemetallurgical works with 2 blast furnaces, a foundry and a rollingmill is nearing completion and will be started in the beginning ofNovember, there is a population of from 5,000 to 6,000, which has settled on what only recently was almost uninhabited steppe. 
 With the influx of a factory population we also observe an influx of traders,handicraftsmen and small industrialists in general, who anticipatean easy and rapid sale to the working population of all kinds of goods. 
” *“The factory seeks cheap weavers, and finds them in their native villages.... 
 The factory must follow the weaver.... 
” ( Industries of Vladimir Gubernia , III, 63. 
) acter of the distribution of our factory industry shows, on the contrary, that its influence is very widespread, and that it is far from being confined to the walls of the factory. 
 * On the other hand, however, this specific character of the distribution of our factory industry cannot butresult in a temporary retardation of the transforming influ-ence of large-scale machine industry on the population itemploys. 
 By converting the backwoodsman-muzhik into a factory worker at one stroke , the factory may for a time ensure for itself a supply of the cheapest, least developedand least exacting “hands. 
” It is obvious, however, thatsuch retardation cannot go on for long, and that it is pur-chased at the price of a still greater expansion of the areasubjected to the influence of large-scale machine industry. 
 IX. 
 THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE LUMBER AND BUILDING INDUSTRIES One of the necessary conditions for the growth of large-scale machine industry (and a highly characteristic concom-itant of its advance) is the development of the industry for the supply of fuel and building materials, as well as of the building industry. 
 Let us begin with the lumberindustry. 
 The felling and preliminary dressing of trees for their own needs has been an occupation of the peasantry fromtime immemorial, one that nearly everywhere forms part of the tiller’s round of work. 
 By the lumber industry, however, we mean exclusively the preparation of lumberfor sale . 
 Characteristic of the post-Reform period is a particularly rapid growth of this industry, the demand for timber having grown rapidly both for personal consumption(the growth of towns, the increase of the non-agricultural population in the villages, and the loss of woodland by the peasants upon their emancipation) and, particularly, for *Let us recall the fact cited above (Chapter III, §IV, p. 
 208, footnote) of the influence exerted by the mining industry in Bakhmut Uyezd, Ekaterinoslav Gubernia, on the local agricultural system. 
—Characteristic also are the common complaints of landowners aboutthe factories “spoiling” the population. 
 productive consumption. 
 The development of commerce, industry, urban life, military requirements, railroads, etc. 
, etc. 
, has led to an enormous increase in the demand fortimber to be used, not by human beings, but by capital. 
 In the industrial gubernias, for instance, the price of wood fuel has risen “by leaps and bounds”: “in the last five years(up to 1881) the price of wood fuel has more than doubled”. 
 * “The price of timber has begun to rise enormously. 
” ** In Kostroma Gubernia “with the huge consumption ofwood fuel by the factories the price has doubled in the past seven years,” *** etc. 
 Timber exports rose from 5,947,000 rubles in 1856 to 30,153,000 rubles in 1881 and 39,200,000 rubles in 1894, i. 
e. 
, in the ratio 100: 507: 659. 
 **** The amount of building timber and wood fuel transported alongthe inland waterways of European Russia in 1866-1868averaged 156 million poods per year( *) and in 1888-1890, 701 million poods per year,( **) i. 
e. 
, there was a more than fourfold increase. 
 The amount transported by railwayin 1888-1890 averaged 290 million poods,( ***) whereas in 1866-1868 it was probably no more than 70 millionpoods. 
( **** ) That is to say, total timber freights in the 60s amounted to about 226 million poods, and in 1888-1890 to 991 million poods—a more than fourfold increase. 
 The vast growth of the lumber industry in precisely the post-Reform period is thus beyond doubt. 
 How is this industry organised? On purely capitalist lines. 
 Forestland is bought from landowners by entrepre-and saw the timber, to float it, etc.

neurs—“lumber industrialists,” who hire workers to fell for example, the Zemstvo statisticians listed only 337 lumber industrialists out of 24,000 peasants engaged in lumber industries. 
 * In Slobodskoi Uyezd, Vyatka Gubernia, 123 lumber industrialists were listed (“the small ones are mostly subcontractors of the big ones,” of whom there were only 10), while the number of workers engaged in lumberingwas 18,865, with average earnings of 19 2 rubles per worker. 
 ** Mr. 
 S. 
 Korolenko calculated that in the whole of European Russia as many as 2 million peasants wereengaged in lumbering, *** and this figure is hardly an exag-geration if, for instance, in 9 uyezds of Vyatka Gubernia (out of 11) about 56,430 lumber workers were listed, and in thewhole of Kostroma Gubernia, about 47,000. 
 **** Lumbering is one of the worst paid occupations; the sanitary conditions are atrocious, and the workers’ health is severely affected. 
Left to toil in the remote forest depths, these workers are in a totally defenceless position, and in this branch of industry bondage, the truck system, and such-like con-comitants of the “patriarchal” peasant industries prevail. 
 In confirmation of this description, let us quote some opinions of local investigators. 
 Moscow statisticians men-tion the “compulsory purchase of provisions,” which usually reduces to a marked degree the lumber workers’ earnings. 
 The Kostroma lumbermen “live in teams in the forests, inhastily and badly erected shanties, where there are no stoves, and which are heated by open hearths. 
 Bad food, consisting of bad soup and of bread which is like stone by the end of theweek, fetid air . 
 . 
 . 
 constantly damp clothes . 
 . 
 . 
 all this is bound to have a disastrous effect upon the health of the lumber industrialists. 
” The people live in “much dirtier” conditionsin the “lumber” volosts than in the industrial volosts (i. 
e. 
,the volosts in which outside employment predominates).

 Frequently in this country no distinction is made in lumbering between masters and workers, the latter also being described as lumber industrialists.

 Regarding Tikhvin Uyezd, Novgorod Gubernia, we read: “Agriculture .

, etc. 
 Thus, the lumber workers constitute one of the big sec-tions of the rural proletariat; they have tiny plots of landand are compelled to sell their labour-power on the mostdisadvantageous terms. 
 The occupation is extremely irregular and casual. 
 The lumbermen, therefore, represent that form of the reserve army (or relative surplus-population in *Transactions of the Handicraft Commission , VIII, pp. 
 1372-1373, 1474. 
 “Thanks to the requirements of the lumber industry there have developed in Tikhvin Uyezd the blacksmith, tanning, fur and partly the boot trades; the first makes boat-hooks, and the othersboots, sheepskin coats and mittens. 
” Incidentally, we see here anexample of how the making of means of production (i. 
e. 
, the growthof Department I in capitalist economy) gives an impetus to the makingof articles of consumption (i. 
e. 
, Department II). 
 It is not production that follows consumption, but consumption that follows production.

 399-400, 405, 147. 
 Cf. 
 the numerous references in the Zemstvo Returns forTrubchevsk Uyezd, Orel Gubernia, to the fact that “agriculture isof secondary importance,” and that the principal part is played byindustries, particularly lumbering ( Statistical Returns for Trub-chevsk Uyezd , Orel, 1887, particularly remarks on villages). 
 capitalist society) which theory describes as latent *; a certain (and, as we have seen, quite large) section of the rural population must always be ready to undertake such work, must always be in need of it. 
 That is a condition forthe existence and development of capitalism. 
 To the extentthat the forests are destroyed by the rapacious methods ofthe lumber industrialists (which proceeds with tremendousrapidity), an ever-growing need is felt for replacing wood by coal, and the coal industry, which alone is capable of serving as a firm basis for large-scale machineindustry, develops at an ever faster rate. 
 Cheap fuel,obtainable at any time and in any quantity, at a definiteand little fluctuating price—such is the demand of themodern factory. 
 The lumber industry is not in a position to meet this demand. 
 ** That is why its predomi-nance over the coal industry as a source of fuel supplycorresponds to a low level of capitalist development. 
 Asfor the social relations of production, in this respect thelumber industry is to the coal industry approximatelywhat capitalist manufacture is to large-scale machine industry. 
 The lumber industry means a technique of the most elementary kind, the exploitation of naturalresources by primitive methods; the coal industry leads to acomplete technical revolution and to the extensive use ofmachinery. 
 The lumber industry leaves the producer a peas-ant; the coal industry transforms him into a factory hand. 
 The lumber industry leaves all the old, patriarchal way of life practically intact, enmeshing in the worst forms of bondage the workers left to toil in the remote forest depthsand taking advantage of their ignorance, defencelessnessand isolation. 
 The coal industry creates mobility of the population, establishes large industrial centres and inevitably leads to the introduction of public control over *Das Kapital , I2, S. 
 668. 
156 **Here is an illustration of this taken from the Report of the Members of the Commission of Inquiry into Factory Industry in theKingdom of Poland (St. 
 Petersburg, 1888, Pt.

 Coal in Poland costs half the Moscow price. 
 The average expense of fuel per pood of yarnin Poland is 16 to 37 kopeks, and in the Moscow area—50 to 73 kopeks. 
In the Moscow area fuel is stocked for 12 to 20 months, in Poland for not more than 3 months, and in most cases for 1 to 4 weeks. 
 production. 
 In a word, the change-over described is of the same progressive significance as the replacement of the manufactory by the factory. 
 * Building was originally also part of the peasant’s round of domestic occupations, and it continues to be so to this daywherever semi-natural peasant economy is preserved. 
 Subse-quent development leads to the building workers’ turning intospecialist artisans , who work to customers’ orders. 
 In the villages and small towns the building industry is largely organised on these lines even today; the artisan usuallymaintains his connection with the land and works for a verynarrow circle of small clients. 
 With the development of cap-italism, the retention of this system of industry becomesimpossible. 
 The growth of trade, factories, towns and railways creates a demand for types of buildings that are architectu-rally and dimensionally different from the old buildingsof the patriarchal epoch. 
 The new buildings require verydiverse and costly materials, the co-operation of masses ofworkers of the most varied specialities and a considerablelength of time for their completion; the distribution of these new buildings does not correspond at all to the tradi-tional distribution of the population; they are erected inlarge towns or suburbs, in uninhabited places, alongrailways in process of construction, etc. 
 The local artisanturns into a migratory worker and is hired by an entrepre-neur contractor , who gradually thrusts himself in between *Mr. 
 N. 
—on, in dealing with the replacement of the lumber by the coal industry ( Sketches , 211, 243), confined himself, as usual, to mere lamentations. 
 Our romanticist tries not to notice the triflingfact that behind the capitalist coal industry stands the equally capi-talist lumber industry, which is marked by incomparably worse forms of exploitation. 
 But he dwells at length on the “number of workers”!What are some 600,000 British miners compared to the millions ofunemployed peasants?—he asks (211). 
 To this we reply: that capital-ism creates a relative surplus-population is beyond doubt, but Mr. 
N. 
—on has absolutely failed to see the connection between this and the requirements of large-scale machine industry. 
 To compare the number of peasants engaged in various occupations even casuallyand irregularly with the number of specialist miners engaged exclu-sively in coal extraction, is absolutely senseless. 
 Mr. 
 N. 
 —on resorts to such devices only in order to hide the fact of the rapid growth inRussia of both the number of factory and mine workers, and of the commercial and industrial population in general, since that mars the consumer and the producer and becomes a real capitalist. 
 The spasmodic development of capitalist economy, the alternation of prolonged periods of bad business with periods of “building booms” (like the one we are experiencingnow, in 1898) tremendously accelerate the expansionand deepening of capitalist relationships in the buildingindustry. 
 Such, according to the material of Russian economic literature, has been the post-Reform evolution of the indus-try under review. 
 * This evolution finds particularly strik-ing expression in the territorial division of labour, in theformation of large areas in which the working populationspecialises in some particular branch of building. 
 ** This specialisation of areas presupposes the formation of large markets for building work and, in this connection, the rise of capitalist relationships. 
 To illustrate this point let us quotedata for one such area. 
 Pokrov Uyezd, Vladimir Gubernia,has long been celebrated for its carpenters, who already at thebeginning of the century constituted more than half thetotal population. 
 After the Reform carpentry continued to spread . 
 *** In “the carpenters’ area the contractors are an element analogous to the subcontractors and factory owners”; they are usually drawn from among the most enterprisingmembers of carpenters’ artels. 
 “Cases are not rare of con-tractors in ten years accumulating from 50,000 to 60,000 rublesand more of clear profit. 
 Some of the contractors employ from *As we have had occasion to state above, it is difficult to establish this evolution because in our literature building workers in general are often called “artisans,” wage-workers being quite incor-rectly classified in this category. 
—Regarding the analogous develop-ment of the organisation of the building industry in the West see, for instance Webb, Die Geschichte des britischen Trade Unionismus , Stuttgart, 1895, S. 
 7. 
 157 **In Yaroslavl Gubernia, for instance, Danilov Uyezd is par-ticularly famous for its stove builders, plasterers and bricklayers,its different volosts mainly supplying specialists in one or other of these trades. 
 Quite a large number of painters come from the Trans-volga part of Yaroslavl Uyezd; carpenters come from the central partof Mologa Uyezd, etc. 
 ( Survey of Yaroslavl Gubernia , Vol II, Yaroslavl, 1896, p. 
 135 and others. 
) *** At the end of the 50s, about 10,000 carpenters used to leave the Argunovo district (Argunovo Volost is the centre of the industry). 
 In the 60s, out of 548 villages in the Pokrov Uyezd, 503 were engaged 300 to 500 carpenters and have become real capitalists. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 It is not surprising that the local peasants say that ‘ nothing pays so well as trading in carpenters . 
’”* It would be hard to give a more striking characterisation of the quintessenceof the present organisation of the industry! “Carpentry hasleft a deep impress upon the whole of peasant life in thislocality. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 The peasant carpenter devotes less and less timeto agriculture, and eventually gives it up altogether. 
” Life in the cities has laid the impress of culture on the carpenter: he lives a much cleaner life than do the surrounding peasants,and is conspicuous for his “cultured appearance,” for “hisrelatively high mental development. 
” ** The total number of building workers in European Russia must be very considerable, judging from the fragmentary data available. 
 In Kaluga Gubernia the number of building workers in 1896 was estimated at 39,860, both local andmigratory. 
 In Yaroslavl Gubernia there were in 1894-95—according to official data—20,170 migratory. 
 In KostromaGubernia there were about 39,500 migratory. 
 In 9 uyezds ofVyatka Gubernia (out of 11), there were about 30,500 migra-tory (in the 80s). 
 In 4 uyezds in Tver Gubernia (out of 12), there were 15,585, both local and migratory. 
 In Gorbatov Uyezd, Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia, there were 2,221, both local and migratory. 
 The number of carpenters alone who leftRyazan Gubernia every year to work in other districts was, according to official figures for 1875 and 1876, not less than 20,000. 
 In Orel Uyezd, Orel Gubernia, there are 2,000 *Ibid.

 In 3 uyezds of Poltava Gubernia (out of 15), there are 1,440. 
 In Nikolayevsk Uyezd, Samara Guber-nia, there are 1,339. 
 * Judging by these figures, the number of building workers in European Russia must be not less than one million . 
** This figure must rather be considered a minimum, for all the sources show that the number of build-ing workers has grown rapidly in the post-Reform period. 
 *** The building workers are industrial proletarians in the making, whose connection with the land—already very slight today **** —is becoming slighter every year. 
 The con-ditions of building workers are very different from those oflumber workers and are more like those of factory workers. 
They work in large urban and industrial centres, which, aswe have seen, considerably raise their cultural standards. 
 While the declining lumber industry typifies weakly devel-oped forms of a capitalism that still tolerates the patriar-chal way of life, the developing building industry typifiesa higher stage of capitalism, leads to the formation of anew class of industrial workers, and marks a deep-goingdifferentiation of the old peasantry. 
 *Sources, apart from those mentioned in the preceding foot-note, are Zemstvo returns. 
 Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
 ( Essays on Handicraft Industry , 61) cites data for 13 uyezds in Poltava, Kursk and Tambov gubernias. 
The total number of building workers (Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
 classifies them all, and wrongly so, as “small industrialists”) is 28,644, ranging from 2. 
7% to 22. 
1% of the total adult male population of the uyezds. 
 Ifwe take the average percentage (8. 
8%) as the standard, the number of building workers in European Russia would be 1 3 million (counting 15 million adult male workers). 
 The gubernias mentioned occupy aposition midway between those where the building industries are most developed and those where they are least developed. 
 **The census of January 28, 1897 ( General Summary , 1905), gives the number of the independent population (those earning their own livelihood) engaged in the building industry throughout the Empire as 717,000, plus 469,000 cultivators occupied in this industryas a side line. 
 ( Note to 2nd edition . 
) *** Fire insurance figures may, to some extent, help us to gauge the dimensions of the building industry. 
 The value of buildingscovered by fire insurance amounted to 5,968 million rubles in 1884, and to 7,854 million rubles in 1893. 
 ( Productive Forces , XII, 65. 
) This shows an annual increase of 188 million rubles. 
 **** In Yaroslavl Gubernia, for example, 11 to 20% of the total population, or 30 to 56%, of the male workers, leave their homes in search of work; 68. 
7% of those who leave are away all the year round (Survey of Yaroslavl Gubernia ). 
 Obviously, all these are “peasants X. 
 THE APPENDAGE TO THE FACTORY By the appendage to the factory we mean those forms of wage-labour and small industry whose existence is directlyconnected with the factory. 
 These include, first of all (inpart), the lumber and building workers, of whom we havespoken and who in some cases directly form part of the industrial population of factory centres, and in others belong to the population of surrounding villages. 
 * Further, they include workers employed on peat bogs—whichare sometimes worked by factory owners themselves **; carters, loaders, packers, and so-called labourers generally,who always constitute a fairly considerable part of the population of industrial centres. 
 In St. 
 Petersburg, for instance, the census of December 15, 1890, registered 44,814persons (of both sexes) in the group of “day labourers andlabourers”; then 51,000 persons (of both sexes) in the cart-ing industry, of whom 9,500 are specially engaged incarting heavy and miscellaneous loads. 
 Further, certain auxiliary work is done for factories by small “independent” industrialists; in factory centres or their environs suchindustries spring up as barrel-making for oil-mills anddistilleries, *** basket-making for packing glassware, **** packing-case making for hardware, the making of wooden *For instance, in Ryazan Gubernia “at the Khludov factory alone” (1894-95—4,849 workers, output 6 million rubles), “as many as 7,000 horses are engaged in the winter in wood-carting, most of them belonging to peasants of the Yegoryevsk Uyezd”158 (Transactions of the Handicraft Commission , VII, pp. 
 1109-1110). 
 **Chaos also reigns in the statistics for the peat industry. 
 As a rule this industry is not classified among the “factory” trades (cf. 
Kobelyatsky, Handbook , p. 
 15), although at times it is. 
 For instance, the List gives 12 peat fields employing 2,201 workers in Vladimir Gubernia and in that gubernia alone, although peat is extracted inother gubernias as well. 
 According to Svirsky ( Factories and Works of Vladimir Gubernia ), in 1890 there were 6,038 persons employed in extracting peat in Vladimir Gubernia. 
 The total number of workersin Russia employed in the extraction of peat must be many times greater. 
 ***Transactions of the Handicraft Commission , Vol.

 VIII, in Novgorod Gubernia. 
 handles for joiners’ and fitters’ tools, * the making of brads for footwear factories, and of “tanning” for leather works, etc. 
, ** the weaving of bast-matting for the packing of factory wares(in the Kostroma and other gubernias), the making of “sticks”for matches (in the Ryazan, Kaluga and other gubernias),cardboard-box making for tobacco factories (in the envi-rons of St. 
 Petersburg), *** the making of wood-dust for vinegar factories, **** the spinning of waste yarn in small spinning sheds (in Lodz), which has developed owing to the demand created by the big mills,( *) etc. 
, etc. 
 All these small industrialists, like the wage-workers referred to above,belong either to the industrial population of factory cen-tres, or to the semi-agricultural population of the surroundingvillages. 
 Furthermore, when a factory’s work is limited to the production of a semi-manufactured article, small indus-tries are sometimes called into existence which engage intreating it further; for example, machine spinning hasgiven an impetus to handicraft weaving, and “handicraft”producers of metal goods cluster around ironworks, etc. 
Finally, capitalist domestic industry is often an appendage to the factory. 
( **) The epoch of large-scale machine industry is marked in all countries by the extensive development ofcapitalist domestic industry in such branches as, for *Ibid.

 (**) In the List we counted 16 factories, each employing 1,000 and more workers on their premises, which had additionally a totalof 7,857 outside workers. 
 Fourteen factories, each with from 500 to 999 workers, employed 1,352 outside workers. 
 The registration of outside work by the List is quite haphazard and full of gaps. 
 The Collection of Factory Inspectors ’ Reports estimates for 1903 a total of 632 work-distributing offices, giving work to 65,115 workers. 
 These data are very incomplete, of course; nevertheless, it is characteristicthat the overwhelming majority of these offices, and the workers they employ, relate to centres of factory industry (Moscow area: 503 offices 49,345 workers; Saratov Gubernia—Sarpinka fabrics—33 offices, 10,000workers). 
 ( Note to 2nd edition . 
) example, ready-made clothing. 
 We have spoken above of the wide extent of such industry in Russia, of the conditions peculiar to it and of the reason for considering it morecorrect to describe it in the chapter on manufacture. 
 In order to give anything like a full description of the appendage to the factory one needs complete statistics on theoccupations of the population, or monographic descriptions of the entire economic life of factory centres and their envi-rons. 
 But even the fragmentary data with which we have hadto content ourselves show the incorrectness of the opinion widespread here that factory industry is isolated from other forms of industry, that the factory population is isolatedfrom the population not employed in factories. 
 The develop-ment of forms of industry, like that of all social relationships in general, cannot but proceed very gradually, among amass of interlocking, transitional forms and seeming rever-sions to the past. 
 Thus, the growth of small industries may express (as we have seen) the progress of capitalist manu-facture; now we see that the factory, too, may sometimes develop small industries. 
 Work for the “buyer-up,” is also an appendage to both the manufactory and the factory. 
To give a proper assessment of the significance of such phe-nomena, we must consider them in conjunction with the whole structure of industry at the given stage of itsdevelopment and with the main trends of this development. 
 XI. 
 THE COMPLETE SEPARATION OF INDUSTRY AGRICULTURE The complete separation of industry from agriculture is effected only by large-scale machine industry. 
 The Rus-sian facts fully confirm this thesis, which was establishedby the author of Capital for other countries, * but which is usually ignored by the Narodnik economists. 
 Mr. 
 N. 
 —on in his Sketches talks in and out of season about “the sepa-ration of industry from agriculture,” without, however, taking the trouble to examine, on the basis of precise data, *Das Kapital , I2, S. 
 779-780 . 
159 how this process is actually taking place and what differ-ent forms it assumes. 
 Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
 points to the connection of our industrial worker with the land ( in manufacture ; our author does not think it necessary to distinguish the various stages of capitalism, although he pretends he is following the theory of the author of Capital !) and declaims in this regard about the “shameful (sic!) dependence” “of our (author’s italics) capitalist industry” upon the worker-farmer, etc. 
 ( Destiny of Capitalism , p. 
 114 and others). 
 Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
 has apparently not heard, or has forgot-ten if he has beard, that not only in “our country” but everywhere in the West, capitalism failed to bring aboutthe complete separation of the workers from the land before large-scale machine industry was established. 
 Finally, Mr. 
 Kablukov has quite recently presented his students with thefollowing amazing distortion of the facts: “Whereas in the West work in the factory is the sole means of livelihood for the worker, in our country, with relatively few exceptions (sic!!!), the worker regards work in the factory as a subsidiary occupation, he is more attracted to the land . 
” * A factual analysis of this question has been made in Mr. 
 Dementyev’s essay on the “factory workers’ connection with agriculture” in the Moscow sanitary statistics. 
 ** Systematically collated statistics embracing about 20,000 workers have shown that only 14. 
1% of the factory workers leave for agricultural employment. 
 But far moreimportant is the fact, proved in the greatest detail in the work mentioned, that it is precisely machine production that divorces the workers from the land . 
 Of a whole series of figures quoted in proof of this fact we select the following most striking ones. 
 *** *Lectures on Agricultural (sic!) Economics , edition for students, Moscow, 1897, p, 13. 
 Perhaps our learned statistician thinks that wemay regard as “relatively few exceptions” 85% of all cases (see furtherin text)? **Statistical Returns for Moscow Gubernia , Section of Sanita-tion Statistics, Vol.

3 We have supplemented the author’s table by dividing 8 of the trades into those carried on by hand and thoseby machinery. 
 As regards the ninth, felt cloth production,let us note that it is conducted partly by hand and partlyby machinery. 
 Of the weavers in hand-loom factoriesabout 63% leave for field-work, while of those working on power-looms not one leaves ; of the workers in depart-ments of cloth mills that are mechanised 3. 
3% leave. 
“Thus, the most important reason for factory workersbreaking their ties with the land is the transition fromhand to machine production. 
 Despite the still relativelyconsiderable number of factories with hand production, the number of workers employed in them, as compared with the number in factories with machine production,is quite negligible, that is why, of those who leavefor field-work, we get proportions as small as 14. 
1%of adult workers in general and 15. 
4% of adult workers belonging exclusively to the peasant social estate. 
” * Let us recall that the returns of the sanitary inspection of factories in Moscow Gubernia gave the following figures: mechanical factories, 22. 
6% of the total (including 18. 
4% using steam-engines); in these, 80. 
7% of the total number of workers are concentrated. 
 Hand-labour factories consti-tute 69. 
2%, employing only 16. 
2% of the total number of workers. 
 At the 244 mechanised factories there are 92,302 workers (378 workers per factory), while at the 747 hand-labour factories there are 18,520 workers (25 workers per *Returns , p.

{ { factory). 
 * We have shown above the considerable con-centration of all Russian factory workers in the largest enterprises, mostly mechanised, which have an average of 488 and more workers per establishment. 
 Mr. 
 Dementyev hasstudied in detail the influence of the workers’ place ofbirth on their separation from the land, differences betweenlocal-born and migrant workers, differences in socialestate (burgher or peasant), etc. 
, and it turned out that all these differences are eclipsed by the influence of the main factor: the transition from hand to machine produc-tion. 
 ** “Whatever causes may have helped to turn the former cultivator into a factory worker, these special workersalready exist. 
 They are merely counted as peasants, buttheir only connection with the village is by way of the taxes they pay when renewing their passports, for actually they have no farm in the village, and very often not even ahouse, which has usually been sold. 
 Even their right toland they retain only juridically, so to speak, and the dis-orders that took place in 1885-1886 at many factories showedthat these workers themselves feel totally alien to the village, just as the peasants in their turn regard them, offspring of their fellow-villagers, as strangers. 
 We areconsequently faced with an already crystallised class ofworkers, possessing no homes of their own and virtually noproperty, a class bound by no ties and living from handto mouth. 
 And its origin does not date from yesterday. 
 It has its factory genealogy, and a fairly large section of it is already in its third generation. 
” *** Lastly, interesting material on the separation of the factory from agriculture *Returns , Vol. 
 IV, Sec. 
 I, pp. 
 167, 170, 177. 
 **Mr. 
 Zhbankov, in his Sanitary Investigation of Factories and Works of Smolensk Gubernia (Smolensk, 1894-1896), estimates the number of workers who leave for field-work at approximately a mere 10 to 15% at the Yartsevo Textile Mill only (Vol II, pp. 
 307,445; in 1893-1894 the Yartsevo Mill employed 3,106 out of the 8,810factory workers in Smolensk Gubernia). 
 Of the men 28% (averagefor all factories, 29%) and of the women 18. 
6% (average for allfactories, 21%) employed in this factory were casual workers, (See Vol. 
 II, p. 
 469. 
) It should be noted that the casual workers include 1) those employed at the factory for less than a year; 2) those wholeave for summer work in the fields; 3) those “who for various reasonsceased work at the factory for several years” (II, 445).

 The List of Factories and Works (data for 1894-95) gives informa-tion on the number of days in the year during which each factory operates. 
 Mr. 
 Kasperov hastened to use thesedata in support of the Narodnik theories when he calculatedthat “on the average, the Russian factory works 165 days ayear,” that “35% of the factories in this country work lessthan 200 days a year. 
” * It goes without saying that in view of the vagueness of the term “factory,” such overall figures are practically valueless, since they do not indicatehow many workers are employed for specific numbers ofdays in the year. 
 We have computed the appropriate fig-ures of the List for those large factories (with 100 and more workers) which, as we have seen above (§VII), employ about w of the total number of factory workers. 
 It turns out that the average number of working days per year in thedifferent categories was as follows: A) 242; B) 235; C) 273, ** and for all the large factories, 244. 
 If we calculate the aver-age number of working days per worker we will get 253working days per year as the average number per worker of a large factory. 
 Of the 12 sections into which the various trades are divided in the List , only in one is the average number of working days, for the bottom categories, below200, namely in section XI (food products): A) 189; B) 148;C) 280. 
 Factories in categories A and B in this section employ 110,588 workers, which is 16. 
2% of the total number of workers in the large factories (655,670). 
 We would point out that this section combines quite diverse trades, e. 
g. 
, beet-sugar and tobacco, distilling and flour-milling, etc. 
 Forthe remaining sections the average number of working daysper factory is as follows: A) 259; B) 271; C) 272. 
 Thus, thelarger the factories the greater the number of days they operate in the course of the year. 
 The general data for all the biggest factories in European Russia, therefore, confirmthe conclusions of the Moscow sanitary statistical returns *Statistical Summary of Russia’s Industrial Development .

 I.

 **Let us recall that category A includes factories with 100 to 499 workers, B, with 500 to 999, and C, with 1,000 and more. 
 and prove that the factory creates a class of permanent factory workers. 
 So then, the data on Russian factory workers fully confirm the theory of Capital that it is large-scale machine industry that brings about a complete and definite revolu-tion in the conditions of life of the industrial population,separating it once and for all from agriculture and fromthe century-old traditions of patriarchal life connected with it. 
 But, by destroying patriarchal and petty-bourgeois relationships, large-scale machine industry creates,on the other hand, conditions which draw wage-workers inagriculture and industry closer together: firstly, itintroduces into the rural districts generally the commercialand industrial way of life which has first arisen in the non-agricultural centres; secondly, it creates mobility of the population and large markets for the hiring of both agricul-tural and industrial workers; thirdly, by introducingmachinery into agriculture, large-scale machine industrybrings into the rural districts skilled industrial workers,distinguished for their higher standard of living. 
 XII. 
 THREE STAGES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF CAPITALISM IN RUSSIAN INDUSTRY Let us now sum up the main conclusions to be drawn from the data on the development of capitalism in our industry. 
 * There are three main stages in this development: small commodity-production (small, mainly peasant industries);capitalist manufacture; and the factory (large-scalemachine industry). 
 The facts utterly refute the view wide-spread here in Russia that “factory” and “handicraft”industry are isolated from each other. 
 On the contrary, such a division is purely artificial. 
 The connection and con-tinuity between the forms of industry mentioned is of themost direct and intimate kind. 
 The facts quite clearlyshow that the main trend of small commodity-production istowards the development of capitalism, in particular,towards the rise of manufacture; and manufacture is *Confining ourselves, as stated in the preface, to the post-Reform period, we leave aside the forms of industry that were based on the labour of the serf population. 
 growing with enormous rapidity before our very eyes into large-scale machine industry. 
 Perhaps one of the most striking manifestations of the intimate and direct connec-tion between the consecutive forms of industry is the factthat many of the big and even the biggest factory ownerswere at one time the smallest of small industrialists andpassed through all the stages from “popular production” to“capitalism. 
” Savva Morozov was a peasant serf (he purchased his freedom in 1820), a cowherd, a carter, a worker weaver, a handicraft weaver who used to journey to Moscow onfoot in order to sell his goods to buyers-up; then he becamethe owner of a small establishment, a work-distributingoffice, a factory. 
 When he died in 1862, he and his numer-ous sons owned two large factories. 
 In 1890, the 4 factories belonging to his descendants employed 39,000 workers, producing goods to the value of 35 million rubles. 
 * In the silk industry of Vladimir Gubernia, a number of big factoryowners were formerly worker weavers or “handicraft” weav-ers. 
 ** The biggest factory owners in Ivanovo-Voznesensk (the Kuvayevs, Fokins, Zubkovs, Kokushkins, Bobrovs and many others) were formerly handicraftsmen. 
 *** The brocade factories in Moscow Gubernia all grew out of handicraftworkrooms. 
 **** The factory owner Zavyalov, of Pavlovo district, still had in 1864 “a vivid recollection of the timewhen he was a plain employee of craftsman Khabarov. 
”( *) Factory owner Varypayev used to be a small handicrafts-man. 
( **) Kondratov was a handicraftsman who used to walk to Pavlovo carrying his wares in a bag. 
( ***) Millowner Asmolov used to be a pedlars’ horse-driver, then a small trader,then proprietor of a small tobacco workshop, and finallyowner of a factory with a turnover of many millions.

 And so on and so forth. 
 It would be interesting to see how, in these and similar cases, the Narodnik economists would determine where “artificial” capitalism begins and “people’s” industry ends. 
 The three main forms of industry enumerated above differ first of all in their systems of technique. 
 Small commodity-production is characterised by its totally primitive, handtechnique that remained unchanged almost from time immemorial. 
 The small producer in industry remains a peasant who follows tradition in his methods of processing raw mate-rial. 
 Manufacture introduces division of labour, which effectsa substantial change in technique and transforms the peasantinto a factory-hand, a “labourer performing one detailedoperation. 
” But production by hand remains, and, on its basis, progress in methods of production is inevitably very slow. 
 Division of labour springs up spontaneously and is passed onby tradition just as peasant labour is. 
 Large-scale machineindustry alone introduces a radical change, throws manualskill overboard, transforms production on new, rationalprinciples, and systematically applies science to production. 
 So long as capitalism in Russia did not organise large-scale machine industry, and in those industries in which it hasnot done so yet, we see almost complete stagnation in tech-nique, we see the employment of the same hand-loom andthe same watermill or windmill that were used in productioncenturies ago. 
 On the other hand, in industries subordinated to the factory we observe a complete technical revolution and extremely rapid progress in the methods of machineproduction. 
 We see that the different stages of the development of capitalism are connected with different systems of tech-nique. 
 Small commodity-production and manufacture are characterised by the prevalence of small establishments,from among which only a few large ones emerge. 
 Large-scalemachine industry completely eliminates the smallestablishments. 
 Capitalist relationships arise in the smallindustries too (in the form of workshops employing wage-workers and of merchant’s capital), but these are still poorlydeveloped and are not crystallised in sharp oppositionsbetween the groups participating in production. 
 Neitherbig capital nor extensive proletarian strata as yet exist. 
 In manufacture we see the rise of both. 
 The gulf between the one who owns the means of production and the one who works now becomes very wide. 
 “Wealthy” industrial settlements spring up, the bulk of whose inhabitants arepoor working people. 
 A small number of merchants, whodo an enormous business buying raw materials and sellingfinished goods, and a mass of detail workers living fromhand to mouth—such is the general picture of manufac-ture. 
 But the multitude of small establishments, the retention of the tie with the land, the adherence to traditionin production and in the whole manner of living—allthis creates a mass of intermediary elements betweenthe extremes of manufacture and retards the developmentof these extremes. 
 In large-scale machine industry all these retarding factors disappear; the acuteness of social contradictions reaches the highest point. 
 All the dark sidesof capitalism become concentrated, as it were: the machine,as we know, gives a tremendous impulse to the greatestpossible prolongation of the working day; women and chil-dren are drawn into industry; a reserve army of unemployed is formed (and must be formed by virtue of the conditions of factory production), etc. 
 However, the socialisation oflabour effected on a vast scale by the factory, and the trans-formation of the sentiments and conceptions of the peopleit employs (in particular, the destruction of patriarchal andpetty-bourgeois traditions) cause a reaction: large-scale machine industry, unlike the preceding stages, imperatively calls for the planned regulation of production and publiccontrol over it (a manifestation of the latter tendency isfactory legislation). 
 * The very character of the development of production changes at the various stages of capitalism. 
 In the small industries this development follows in the wake of the development of peasant economy; the market is extremelynarrow, the distance between the producer and the consumeris short, and the insignificant scale of production easilyadapts itself to the slightly fluctuating local demand. 
 That *On the connection between factory legislation and the conditions and relationships brought into being by large-scale machine industry, see Mr. 
 Tugan-Baranovsky’s book, The Russian Factory , Chapter II, Part 2, and especially the article in Novoye Slovo of July 1897. 
 is why industry at this stage is characterised by the greatest stability, but this stability is tantamount to stagnation in technique and the preservation of patriarchal social rela-tionships tangled up with all sorts of survivals of medievaltraditions. 
 The manufactories work for a big market—some-times for the whole country—and, accordingly, pro-duction acquires the instability characteristic of capitalism,an instability which attains the greatest intensity under factory production. 
 Large-scale machine industry can only develop in spurts, in alternating periods of prosperity andof crisis. 
 The ruin of small producers is tremendously accel-erated by this spasmodic growth of the factory; the workersare drawn into the factory in masses during a boom period,and are then thrown out. 
 The formation of a vast reserve army of unemployed, ready to undertake any kind of work, becomes a condition for the existence and development oflarge-scale machine industry. 
 In Chapter II we showed fromwhich strata of the peasantry this army is recruited, andin subsequent chapters we indicated the main types ofoccupations for which capital keeps these reserves ready. 
 The “instability” of large-scale machine industry has always evoked, and continues to evoke, reactionary complaintsfrom individuals who continue to look at things through theeyes of the small producer and who forget that it is this“instability” alone that replaced the former stagnation bythe rapid transformation of methods of production and of all social relationships. 
 One of the manifestations of this transformation is the separation of industry from agriculture, the liberation ofsocial relations in industry from the traditions of thefeudal and patriarchal system that weigh down on agricul-ture. 
 In small commodity-production the industrialist has not yet emerged at all from his peasant shell; in the majority of cases he remains a farmer, and this connectionbetween small industry and small agriculture is so profoundthat we observe the interesting law of the parallel differen-tiation of the small producers in industry and in agriculture. 
 The formation of a petty bourgeoisie and of wage-workersproceeds simultaneously in both spheres of the national economy, thereby preparing the way, at both poles of differ-entiation, for the industrialist to break with agriculture. 
 Under manufacture this break is already very considerable. 
 A whole number of industrial centres arise that do not engage in agriculture. 
 The chief representative of industry is no longer the peasant, but the merchant and the manufac-tory owner on the one hand, and the “artisan” on the other. 
Industry and the relatively developed commercial inter-course with the rest of the world raise the standard of livingand the culture of the population; the peasant is now regarded with disdain by the manufactory workman. 
 Large-scale machine industry completes this transformation,separates industry from agriculture once and for all, and, aswe have seen, creates a special class of the populationtotally alien to the old peasantry and differing from thelatter in its manner of living, its family relationships and its higher standard of requirements, both material and spiri-tual. 
 * In the small industries and in manufacture we always find survivals of patriarchal relations and of diverse forms of personal dependence, which, in the general conditions ofcapitalist economy, exceedingly worsen the condition of theworking people, and degrade and corrupt them. 
 Large-scalemachine industry, which concentrates masses of workerswho often come from various parts of the country,absolutely refuses to tolerate survivals of patriarchalism andpersonal dependence, and is marked by a truly “contemp-tuous attitude to the past. 
” It is this break with obsoletetradition that is one of the substantial conditions whichhave created the possibility and evoked the necessity ofregulating production and of public control over it. 
 Inparticular, speaking of the transformation brought aboutby the factory in the conditions of life of the population,it must be stated that the drawing of women andjuveniles into production ** is, at bottom, progressive.

 also the above-mentioned works of Mr. 
 Zhbankov which describe the workers who go off to the townsto commercial and industrial occupations. 
 **According to the Directory , the factories and works of Euro-pean Russia in 1890 employed a total of 875,764 workers of whom 210,207 (24%) were women, 17,793 (2%) boys, and 8,216 (1%) girls. 
 indisputable that the capitalist factory places these categories of the working population in particularly hard conditions, and that for them it is particularly necessary to regulate and shorten the working day, to guarantee hygienic conditionsof labour, etc. 
; but endeavours completely to ban the workof women and juveniles in industry, or to maintain thepatriarchal manner of life that ruled out such work, would bereactionary and utopian. 
 By destroying the patriarchal isolation of these categories of the population who formerly never emerged from the narrow circle of domestic, familyrelationships, by drawing them into direct participation insocial production, large-scale machine industry stimulatestheir development and increases their independence, inother words, creates conditions of life that are incomparably superior to the patriarchal immobility of pre-capitalist relations. 
 * *“The poor woman-weaver follows her father and husband to the factory and works alongside of them and independently of them. 
 She is as much a breadwinner as the man is. 
” “In the factory ... thewoman is quite an independent producer, apart from her husband. 
” Literacy spreads among the women factory workers with remarkable rapidity. 
 ( Industries of Vladimir Gubernia , III, 113, 118, 112 and elsewhere. 
) Mr. 
 Kharizomenov is perfectly right in drawing the follow-ing conclusion: industry destroys “the economic dependence of the woman on the family ... and on the husband.... 
 At the factory, thewoman is the equal of the man; this is the equality of the proletarian.... 
 The capitalisation of industry is an important factor in woman’s struggle for her independence in the family. 
” “Industry creates a newposition for the woman in which she is completely independent of her family and husband. 
” ( Yuridichesky Vestnik , 1883, No. 
 12, pp. 
 582, 596. 
) In the Statistical Returns for Moscow Gubernia (Vol. 
 VII, Pt. 
 II, Moscow, 1882, pp. 
 152, 138-139), the investigators compare the position of women engaged in making stockings by hand and by machine. 
 The daily earnings of hand workers are about 8 kopeks, and of machine workers, 14 to 30 kopeks. 
 The working woman’s con-ditions under machine production are described as follows: “... Beforeus is a free young woman, hampered by no obstacles, emancipatedfrom the family and from all that constitutes the peasant woman’s conditions of life, a young woman who at any moment may leave one place for another, one employer for another, and may at any momentfind herself without a job ... without a crust of bread.... 
 Under handproduction, the knitter’s earnings are very meagre, insufficient tocover the cost of her food, earnings only acceptable if she, as a memberof an allotment-holding and farming family, enjoys in part the prod-uct of that land; under machine production the working woman, in The settled character of the population is typical of the first two stages of industrial development. 
 The small industrialist, remaining a peasant, is bound to his village by his farm. 
 The artisan under manufacture is usually tied tothe small, isolated industrial area which is created by manu-facture. 
 In the very system of industry at the first andsecond stages of its development there is nothing to disturbthis settled and isolated condition of the producer. 
 Inter-course between the various industrial areas is rare. 
 The transfer of industry to other areas is due only to the migrationof individual small producers, who establish new smallindustries in the outlying parts of the country. 
 Large-scalemachine industry, on the other hand, necessarily createsmobility of the population; commercial intercourse between the various districts grows enormously; railways facilitate travel. 
 The demand for labour increases on the whole—rising in periods of boom and falling in periods of crisis, sothat it becomes a necessity for workers to go from one factoryto another, from one part of the country to another. 
 Large-scale machine industry creates a number of new industrial centres, which grow up with unprecedented rapidity, sometimes in unpopulated places, a thing that would beimpossible without the mass migration of workers. 
 Further onwe shall speak of the dimensions and the significance ofthe so-called outside non-agricultural industries. 
 At themoment we shall limit ourselves to a brief presentation of Zemstvo sanitation statistics for Moscow Gubernia. 
 An inquiry among 103,175 factory workers showed that 53,238, or51. 
6% of the total, were born in the uyezd in which theyworked. 
 Hence, nearly half the workers had migrated fromone uyezd to another. 
 The number of workers who were bornin Moscow Gubernia was 66,038, or 64%. 
 * More than a third of the workers came from other gubernias (chiefly from gubernias of the central industrial zone adjacent to Moscow addition to food and tea, gets earnings which enable ... her to live away from the family and to do without the family’s income from the land.... 
 Moreover, the woman worker’s earnings in machine industry,under present conditions, are more secure. 
” *In the less industrialised Smolensk Gubernia, an inquiry among 5,000 factory workers showed that 80% of them were natives of thatgubernia (Zhbankov, loc. 
 cit. 
, II, 442). 
 Gubernia). 
 A comparison of the different uyezds shows the most highly industrialised ones to be marked by the lowest percentage of locally-born workers. 
 For example, in the poorly industrialised Mozhaisk and Volokolamsk uyezdsfrom 92 to 93% of the factory workers are natives of the uyezdwhere they work. 
 In the very highly industrialised Moscow,Kolomna and Bogorodsk uyezds the percentage of locally-born workers drops to 24%, 40% and 50%. 
 From this the investigators draw the conclusion that “the considerable development of factory production in an uyezd encouragesthe influx of outside elements. 
” * These facts show also (let us add) that the movement of industrial workers bears thesame features that we observed in the movement of agricul-tural workers. 
 That is to say, industrial workers, too, migrate not only from localities where there is a surplus of labour, but also from those where there is a shortage. 
 For example,the Bronnitsi Uyezd attracts 1,125 workers from other uyezdsof Moscow Gubernia and from other gubernias, while at thesame time providing 1,246 workers for the more highlyindustrialised Moscow and Bogorodsk uyezds. 
 Hence, workers leave not only because they do not find “local occupations at hand,” but also because they make for the places whereconditions are better. 
 Elementary as this fact is, it is worthwhile giving the Narodnik economists a further reminder ofit, for they idealise local occupations and condemnmigration to industrial districts, ignoring the progressive significance of the mobility of the population created by capitalism. 
 The above-described characteristic features which dis-tinguish large-scale machine industry from the precedingforms of industry may be summed up in the words—social-isation of labour. 
 Indeed, production for an enormous national and international market, development of close commercial ties with various parts of the country and withdifferent countries for the purchase of raw and auxiliarymaterials, enormous technical progress, concentration ofproduction and of the population in colossal enterprises,demolition of the worn-out traditions of patriarchal life, *Statistical Returns for Moscow Gubernia , Sanitary Statistical Section, Vol. 
 IV, Sec. 
 I (Moscow, 1890), p. 
 240. 
 creation of mobility of the population, and improvement of the worker’s standard of requirements and his develop-ment—all these are elements of the capitalist process which is increasingly socialising production in the country, andwith it those who participate in production. 
 * On the problem of the relation of large-scale machine industry in Russia to the home market for capitalism, thedata given above lead to the following conclusion. 
 The rapid development of factory industry in Russia is creating an enormous and ever-growing market for means of production(building materials, fuel, metals, etc. 
) and is increasing withparticular rapidity the part of the population engaged in *The data quoted in the last three chapters show, in our opinion, that the classification of the capitalist forms and stages of industrygiven by Marx is more correct and sound than the now current classi-fication which confuses the manufactory with the factory and regardsworking for a buyer-up as a special form of industry (Held, Bücher). 
To confuse the manufactory with the factory is to make purely super-ficial features the basis for classification and to ignore the essential features of technique, economy and social life which distinguishmanufacture from the machine period of capitalism. 
 As to capitalistdomestic industry, it undoubtedly plays a very important part inthe mechanism of capitalist industry. 
 Just as undoubtedly, work forthe buyer-up is particularly characteristic of pre-machine capitalism; but it is also to be met with (and on no small scale) in the most diverse periods of capitalist development. 
 The significance of work forthe buyer-up is not to be understood unless studied in connectionwith the whole structure of industry in the given period, or at thegiven stage of capitalist development. 
 The peasant who weavesbaskets to the order of the village shopkeeper, the Pavlovo artisan who makes knife-handles in his home to the order of Zavyalov, the woman worker who makes clothes, footwear, gloves or boxes to the order ofbig mill owners or merchants—all work for buyers-up, but in all theseinstances capitalist domestic industry bears a different character andhas a different significance. 
 We do not, of course, in the least denythe merits of Bücher, for example, in studying pre-capitalist forms of industry, but we think his classification of capitalist forms of industry is wrong. 
—We cannot agree with the views of Mr. 
 Struve(see Mir Bozhy , 1898, No. 
 4) inasmuch as he adopts Bücher’s theory (in the part mentioned) and applies it to Russian “handicraftism. 
”(Since these lines were written, in 1899, Mr. 
 Struve has managed tocomplete the cycle of his scientific and political development. 
 From a person oscillating between Bücher and Marx, between liberal and socialist economics, he has become a liberal bourgeois of the purestwater. 
 The writer of these lines is proud of having helped, as far ashas been in his power, to purge Social-Democracy of such elements. 
(Note to 2nd edition . 
) making articles of productive and not personal consumption. 
 But the market for articles of personal consumption is also growing rapidly, owning to the growth of large-scale machine industry, which is diverting an increasingly large part ofthe population from agriculture into commercial and indus-trial occupations. 
 As for the home market for factory-madeproducts, the process of the formation of that market wasexamined in detail in the early chapters of this book. 
 C H A P T E R VIII THE FORMATION OF THE HOME MARKET We now have to sum up the data examined in the preceding chapters and to try to give an idea of the inter-dependence of the various spheres of the national economy in their capitalist development. 
 I. 
 THE GROWTH OF COMMODITY CIRCULATION It is well known that commodity circulation precedes commodity production and constitutes one of the condi-tions (but not the sole condition) of the rise of the latter. 
In the present work we have confined ourselves to an exam-ination of data on commodity and capitalist production,and for that reason do not intend to deal in detail with theimportant problem of the growth of commodity circulation in post-Reform Russia. 
 In order to give a general idea of how rapidly the home market has grown, the following briefdata will suffice. 
 The length of the Russian railway system increased from 3,819 kilometres in 1865 to 29,063 km. 
 in 1890, * i. 
e. 
, more than 7-fold. 
 Similar progress was made by Britain in a longer period (1845—4,082 km. 
; 1875—26,819 km. 
, a 6-fold increase), by Germany in a shorter period (1845—2,143 km. 
; 1875—27,981 km. 
, a 12-fold increase). 
 Thelength of new railway opened per year differed considerablyin different periods; for example, in the 5 years 1868-1872 *Uebersichten der Weltwirtschaft (Surveys of World Economy . 
— Ed. 
), loc. 
 cit. 
 In 1904 the length was 54,878 kilometres in European Russia (including the Kingdom of Poland, the Caucasus and Fin-land) and 8,351 in Asiatic Russia. 
 ( Note to 2nd edition . 
) 8,806 versts of new railway were opened and in the 5 years 1878-1882, only 2,221. 
 * The extent of this fluctuation enables us to judge what an enormous reserve army of unem-ployed is required by capitalism, which now expands, andthen contracts the demand for labour. 
 There have been twoboom periods in railway development in Russia: the end ofthe 60s (and the beginning of the 70s), and the latter half ofthe 90s. 
 From 1865 to 1875, the average annual increase in the length of the Russian railway system was 1,500 kilo-metres, and from 1893 to 1897, about 2,500 kilometres. 
 The amount of railway freight carried was as follows: 1868—439 million poods; 1873—1,117 million poods;1881—2,532 million poods; 1893—4,846 million poods;1896—6,145 million poods; 1904—11,072 million poods. 
 No less rapid has been the growth of passenger traffic: 1868— 10.

 The value of these freights was 186.

 Russia’s merchant marine in 1868 consisted of 51 steamers with a capacity of 14,300 lasts, 160 and of 700 sailing ships with a capacity of 41,800 lasts; and in 1896 of 522steamers with a capacity of 161,600 lasts. 
 * The development of mercantile shipping at all ports on the outer seas was as follows: during the five years 1856-1860 the number of homeward plus outward bound vessels averaged 18,901, with a total capacity of 3,783,000 tons; for the period 1886-1890 it averaged 23,201 vessels ( #23%) with a total capacity of 13,845,000 tons ( #266%). 
 Capacity, therefore, increased 3 q times. 
 In 39 years (from 1856 to 1894) capacity grew 5. 
5-fold, and if we take Russian andforeign vessels separately, it is seen that during these 39 years the number of the former grew 3. 
4-fold (from 823 to 2,789), while their capacity grew 12. 
1-fold (from 112,800tons to 1,368,000 tons), whereas the number of the latter grew by 16% (from 18,284 to 21,160) and their capacity 5. 
3-fold (from 3,448,000 tons to 18,267,000 tons). 
 ** Let us remark that the capacity of homeward and outward bound vessels also fluctuates very considerably from year to year (e. 
g. 
, 1878—13 million tons; 1881—8. 
6 million tons), andthese fluctuations enable us to gauge in part the fluctuations in the demand for unskilled labourers, dockers, etc. 
 Here, too, capitalism requires the existence of a mass of peoplealways in want of work and ready at the first call to accept it, however casual it may be.

11 The following data give a general idea of the volume of bank turnover and capital accumulation. 
 Total withdrawals from the State Bank rose from 113 million rubles in1860-1863 (170 million rubles in 1864-1868) to 620 millionrubles in 1884-1888, and total deposits on currentaccount from 335 million rubles in 1864-1868 to 1,495million rubles in 1884-1888. 
 * The turnover of loan and savings societies and banks (rural and industrial) grew from 2w million rubles in 1872 (21. 
8 million rubles in 1875) to 82. 
6 million rubles in 1892. 
, and 189. 
6 million rubles in1903. 
 ** Mortgages increased from 1889 to 1894 as follows: the assessment of mortgaged land rose from 1,395 millionrubles to 1,827 million rubles, and total loans from 791 million rubles to 1,044 million rubles. 
 *** The operations of savings banks grew particularly in the 80s and 90s. 
 In1880 there were 75 savings banks, in 1897—4,315 (of which3,454 were post-office banks). 
 In 1880, deposits amounted to4. 
4 million rubles, in 1897 to 276. 
6 million rubles. 
 Balanceon account at the end of the year totalled 9. 
0 million rubles in 1880, and 494. 
3 million rubles in 1897. 
 The annual cap-ital increase is particularly striking in the famine years 1891 and 1892 (52. 
9 and 50. 
5 million rubles), and in thelast two years (1896—51. 
6 million rubles; 1897—65. 
5 mil-lion rubles).

 The latest statistics show an even greater development of the savings banks. 
 In 1904, over the whole of Russia there were 6,557 savings banks with 5. 
1 million depositors and total deposits of 1,105. 
5 million rubles. 
 Incidentally,in this country both the old Narodniks and the new oppor-tunists in the socialist movement have frequently been verynaïve (to put it mildly) in talking about the increase in thenumber of savings banks constituting a sign of the “people’s” well-being. 
 It will perhaps not be out of place, therefore, to compare the distribution of savings-bank deposits inRussia (1904) with that of France (1900.

1 100 What a wealth of material there is here for Narodnik-Revisionist-Cadet apologists! It is interesting, in passing, tonote that in Russia deposits are also divided into 12 groupsaccording to the occupations and professions of depositors. 
It appears that the largest sum of deposits—228. 
5 millionrubles—is that of persons engaged in agriculture and rural industries, and these deposits are growing with particular rapidity. 
 The village is becoming civilised, and to make the muzhik’s ruin a source of business is becoming increasingly profitable. 
 But let us return to our immediate theme. 
 As we see, the data indicate an enormous growth of commodity circulationand capital accumulation. 
 How the field for the employmentof capital in all branches of the national economy wascreated and how merchant’s capital was transformed intoindustrial capital, i. 
e. 
, was directed into production and created capitalist relationships between those taking part in production, has been shown above. 
 II. 
 THE GROWTH OF THE AND INDUSTRIAL POPULATION We have stated above that the growth of the indus-trial population at the expense of the agricultural is arequisite phenomenon of every capitalist society. 
 In whatway the separation of industry from agriculture steadilytakes place has also been examined, and now all thatremains is to sum up on this question. 
 1) T h e G r o w t h o f t h e T o w n s The most striking expression of the process under exami-nation is the growth of the towns. 
 Here are data on thisgrowth in European Russia (50 gubernias) in the post-Reform period *: *For 1863 the figures are from the Statistical Chronicle (I, 1866) and the Military Statistical Abstract . 
 The figures of the urban popula-tion of the Orenburg and Ufa gubernias have been corrected according to the tables of towns. 
 That is why our figure for the total urbanpopulation is 6,105,100 and not 6,087,100 as given in the Mili-tary Statistical Abstract . 
—For 1885 the data are from Returns for Russia for 1884-85 . 
—For 1897 the figures are those of the returns of the census of January 28, 1897. 
 ( First General Census of the Popu-lation of the Russian Empire , 1897 , Central Statistical Committee, St. 
 Petersburg, 1897 and 1898, Pts. 
 1 and 2. 
) The permanent urbanpopulation, according to the 1897 census, was 11,830,500, i. 
e. 
, 12. 
55%. 
We have taken the existing population of the towns. 
—Let us observethat we cannot vouch for the figures for 1863, 1885 and 1897 beingabsolutely uniform and comparable. 
 For that reason we limit our comparison to the most general proportions and give the data for the big towns separately.

 * The population of the towns is growing twice as fast as that of the rest of the country: from 1863 to 1897 the total population increased 53. 
3%, the rural 48. 
5%, while the urbanincreased 97%. 
 Over a period of 11 years (1885-1897) “the influx, at a minimum, of the rural population into the towns” was 2 2 million persons, according to Mr. 
 V. 
 Mikhailovsky’s estimate, ** i. 
e. 
, more than 200,000 per annum. 
 The population of towns that are important industrial and commercial centres is growing much more rapidly thanthe urban population generally. 
 The number of towns with 50,000 and more inhabitants more than trebled between 1863 and 1897 (13 and 44). 
 In 1863, of the total urbanpopulation only about 27% (1. 
7 million out of 6. 
1) were concentrated in such large centres; in 1885 it was nearly 41% (4. 
1 million out of 9. 
9), *** and in 1897 it was already more than half, about 53% (6. 
4 million out of 12 million). 
 In the 1860s, therefore, the smaller towns provided the general pattern of the urban population, but in the 1890s they werecompletely outweighed by the big cities. 
 The population of the 14 towns that had been the biggest in 1863 increased from 1. 
7 million inhabitants to 4. 
3 million, i. 
e. 
, by 153%,whereas the overall urban population increased by only 97%. 
 Hence, the enormous growth of large industrial centres and the emergence of a large number of new centresis one of the most characteristic features of the post-Reform period. 
 *“The number of urban settlements of an agricultural character is extremely small and the number of their inhabitants is quite insignificant compared with the total number of town-dwellers. 
” (Mr. 
 Grigoryev in The Influence of Harvests and Grain Prices , Vol. 
 II, p. 
 126. 
) **Novoye Slovo , June 1897, p. 
 113. 
 *** Mr. 
 Grigoryev gives a table (loc, cit. 
, 140) which shows that in 1885 of all towns 85. 
6% had less than 20,000 inhabitants each; 38% of all town-dwellers were living in them; 12. 
4% of the towns (82 out of 660) had less than 2,000 inhabitants each, and only 1. 
1%of all town-dwellers (110,000 out of 9,962,000) were living in them. 
 2) T h e S i g n i f i c a n c e o f H o m e C o l o n i s a t i o n As we have pointed out above (Chapter I, §II, p. 
 40), theory deduces the law that the industrial populationgrows at the expense of the agricultural from the factthat in industry variable capital increases absolutely (thegrowth of variable capital means a growth of the number of industrial workers and a growth of the total commercial and industrial population), whereas in agriculture the “varia-ble capital required for the exploitation of a certain plot ofland decreases absolutely. 
” “It can thus only increase,” Marxadds, “to the extent that new land is taken into cultivation,but this again requires as a prerequisite a still greater growth of the non-agricultural population. 
” 161 Hence it is clear that the growth of the industrial population is a phenomenonobservable in its pure form only when we have before us analready populated territory in which all the land is alreadyoccupied. 
 The inhabitants of such a territory, when forced-outof agriculture by capitalism, have no other alternative but to migrate to the industrial centres or to other countries. 
 But the situation is essentially different when we have before usa territory in which not all the land is occupied, and whichis not yet fully populated. 
 The inhabitants of such a terri-tory, when forced out of agriculture in a populated area,may remove to an unpopulated part of that territory and set about “taking new land into cultivation. 
” The result will be an increase in the agricultural population, and thisincrease may be (for some time) no less, if not more, rapidthan the increase in the industrial population. 
 In that case,we have before us two different processes: 1) the developmentof capitalism in the old, populated country or part of the country; 2) the development of capitalism on “new land. 
” The first process expresses the further development of estab-lished capitalist relationships; the second, the rise of newcapitalist relationships on new territory. 
 The first processmeans the development of capitalism in depth, the second,in breadth. 
 Obviously, to confuse these two processes must inevitably lead to a wrong conception of the process which diverts the population from agriculture to commercial andindustrial occupations. 
 Post-Reform Russia affords us an example of the two proc-esses going on simultaneously. 
 At the beginning of the post-Reform period, in the 60s, the southern and eastern outer regions of European Russia were largely unpopulated, andthere was an enormous influx into those areas of migrantsfrom the central agricultural part of Russia. 
 It was thisformation of a new agricultural population on new territorythat to some extent obscured the parallel process of the diversion of the population from agriculture to industry. 
 To get a clear picture, from data on the urban population, ofthe specific feature of Russia here described, we must dividethe 50 gubernias of European Russia into separate groups. 
We give data on the urban population in 9 areas of EuropeanRussia in 1863 and in 1897 (see p. 
 564). 
 As far as the question that interests us is concerned, the greatest importance attaches to three areas: 1) the non-agricultural industrial area (the 11 gubernias in the firsttwo groups, including the 2 metropolitan gubernias). 
 * This is an area from which migration to other areas has been veryslight. 
 2) The central agricultural area (the 13 gubernias in group 3). 
 Migration from this area has been very consider-able, partly to the previous area, but mainly to the next. 
3) The agricultural outer regions (the 9 gubernias in group 4)constitute an area that has been colonised in the post-Reform period. 
 The percentage of urban population in allthese 33 gubernias differs very little, as the table shows, from the percentage of urban population in European Russia as a whole. 
 In the first area, the non-agricultural or industrial, we observe a particularly rapid rise in the percentage of urbanpopulation: from 14. 
1% to 21. 
1%. 
 The growth of the ruralpopulation is here very slight, being little more than half of that for the whole of Russia. 
 The growth of the urban *That we are right in combining with the metropolitan guber-nias the non-agricultural gubernias taken by us is borne out by thefact that the population of the metropolitan cities is augmented chiefly by migrants from these gubernias. 
 According to the Petersburg census of December 15,1890, there were in that city 726,000 membersof the peasant and the burgher estates, of these, 544,000 (i. 
e. 
, three-fourths) were members of the peasant and the burgher estates from the 11 gubernias out of which we constituted area No.

No.

 If Russia is to be compared withWest-European industrial countries (as is often done here),then these countries should be compared with just this onearea, for it alone has conditions approximately similar tothose of the industrial capitalist countries. 
 In the second, the central agricultural area, we see a different picture. 
 The percentage of urban population hereis very low and grows with less than average rapidity. 
 Theincrease in the population between 1863 and 1897, bothurban and rural, was much below the average for Russia. 
This is to be explained by the vast stream of migrants fromthis area to the border regions. 
 According to Mr. 
 V. 
 Mikhail-ovsky’s calculations, between 1885 and 1897 nearly 3 million people , or more than one-tenth of the population left these parts. 
 * In the third area, the outer regions, we see that the per-centage of urban population underwent an increase that“was slightly below the average (from 11. 
2% to 13. 
3%, i. 
e. 
, in the proportion of 100 : 118, whereas the average is from9. 
94 to 12. 
76, i. 
e. 
, in the proportion of 100 : 128). 
 And yetthe absolute growth of the urban population here, far frombeing less, was considerably above the average (#130% as culture to industry has, consequently, been very intense,but it is hidden by the enormous growth of the agriculturalpopulation as a result of influx: in this area the ruralpopulation increased by 87%, as against an average forRussia of 48. 
5%. 
 In certain gubernias this obscuringof the process of the industrialisation of the populationis still more striking. 
 For instance, in Taurida Guberniathe percentage of urban population was the same in 1897as in 1863 (19. 
6%), and in Kherson Gubernia actuallydeclined (from 25. 
9% to 25. 
4%), although the growth of thetowns in both the gubernias was not far behind that of the in the two metropolitan gubernias). 
 The rise of a new agri-cultural population on new territory thus leads, in turn,to a still greater growth of the non-agricultural population.

against #97%). 
 The diversion of population from agri-metropolitan cities (#131%, #135%, as against #141% 3) T h e G r o w t h o f F a c t o r y a n d o f C o m m e r c i a l a n d I n d u s t r i a l T o w n s h i p s a n d V i l l a g e s In addition to the towns, the following have the signifi-cance of industrial centres: firstly, suburbs, which are notalways counted with the towns and which are spreading inan increasing area around the big towns; and secondly, fac-tory townships and villages. 
 Such industrial centres * are particularly numerous in the industrial gubernias where the percentage of urban population is extremely low. 
 ** The above table containing the data, by areas, of the townpopulation shows that in the 9 industrial gubernias the per-centage in 1863 was 7. 
3% and in 1897, 8. 
6%. 
 The fact isthat the commercial and industrial population of these gubernias is concentrated mainly, not in towns, but in indus-trial villages. 
 Among the “towns” of Vladimir, Kostroma,Nizhni-Novgorod and other gubernias there are not a fewwith less than 3,000, 2,000 or even 1,000 inhabitants, where-as there are numerous “villages” in each of which thereare 2,000, 3,000 or 5,000 factory workers alone. 
 In the post-Reform period, rightly observes the compiler of the Survey of Yaroslavl Gubernia (Vol. 
 II. 
, 191), “the towns have begun to grow still faster, and in addition there has been the growthof settlements of a new type, a type of factory centremidway between the town and the village. 
” We havecited data showing the enormous growth of these centres and the number of factory workers concentrated in them. 
 We have seen that there are quite a few centres of this kindthroughout Russia, not only in the industrial gubernias,but also in the South. 
 In the Urals the percentage of urbanpopulation is lowest: in Vyatka and Perm gubernias it was3. 
2% in 1863 and 4. 
7% in 1897. 
 But here is an example of the relative size of the “urban” and the industrial popula-tions: in Krasnoufimsk Uyezd, Perm Gubernia, the urbanpopulation numbers 6,400 (1897), whereas according tothe Zemstvo census of 1888-1891, the population of the *See above, Chapter VII, §VIII, and Appendix III to Chapter VII. 
 **On the significance of this circumstance, to which Korsak in his day drew attention, compare the just remarks of Mr. 
 Volgin (loc. 
 cit. 
, pp. 
 215-216). 
 industrial section of the uyezd numbers 84,700, of whom 56,000 do not engage in agriculture at all, and only 5,600 obtain their livelihood mainly from the land. 
 In Ekaterin-burg Uyezd, according to the Zemstvo census, 65,000 inhab-itants are landless and 81,000 have only meadow land. 
Hence, the industrial non-urban population of two uyezdsalone is larger than the urban population of the wholegubernia (in 1897 it was 195,600!). 
 Finally, in addition to factory settlements, the signifi-cance of industrial centres attaches to the trading andindustrial villages, which are either at the head of largehandicraft districts, or have developed rapidly since theReform, owing to their situation on the banks of rivers, nearrailway stations, etc. 
 Several examples of such villages were given in Chapter VI, §II, and we saw that, like the towns, they attract the rural population, and that they are usuallymarked by a level of literacy among the population abovethe average. 
 * As a further example let us quote data on Voronezh Gubernia in order to show the relative importance *How numerous in Russia are villages that constitute very big centres of population may be judged from the following (though obsolete) data of the Military Statistical Abstract : in 25 gubernias of European Russia there were in the 60s a total of 1,334 villages with over2,000 inhabitants each. 
 Of them, 108 had from 5,000 to 10,000 inha-bitants, 6 from 10,000 to 15,000, 1 from 15,000 to 20,000 and 1 over20,000 (p. 
 169). 
 The development of capitalism in all countries, not only in Russia, has led to the rise of new industrial centres not offici-ally classified as towns. 
 “Differences between town and country areobliterated, near growing industrial towns this takes place due to theremoval of industrial enterprises and workers’ dwellings to the sub-urbs and outskirts of the towns; near declining small towns it takesplace due to the merging of the latter with the surrounding villages and also to the development of large industrial villages.... 
 Differences between the urban and rural populated areas are eliminated dueto numerous transitional formations. 
 Statisticians have recognisedthis long ago, and instead of the historico-juridical concept of thetown have adopted the statistical concept, which distinguishes centresof population solely according to the number of inhabitants” (Bücher, Die Entstehung der Volkswirtschaft , Tübingen, 1893, S. 
 296-297 and 303-304). 
 In this respect also Russian statistics lag far behind Euro-pean statistics. 
 In Germany and in France ( Statesman ’s Yearbook , pp. 
 536, 474) under towns are placed centres of population havingmore than 2,000 inhabitants, and in England “net urban sanitarydistricts,” i. 
e. 
, also factory villages, etc. 
 Hence, Russian data on the “urban” population are not at all comparable with European. 
 of urban and non-urban industrial and commercial centres of population. 
 The Combined Returns for Voronezh Gubernia gives a combined table classifying the villages in 8 uyezds of the gubernia. 
 In these uyezds there are 8 towns, with apopulation of 56,149 (in 1897). 
 Of the villages, on the otherhand, 4 stand out with 9,376 households, and with 53,732inhabitants, i. 
e. 
, they are much bigger than the towns. 
 In5 these villages there are 240 commercial and 404 industrial establishments. 
 Of the total households, 60% do not cultivate at all, 21% cultivate by neighbour-hire or on ahalf-crop basis, 71% have neither draught animals norimplements, 63% buy grain all year round, 86% engage inindustries. 
 By placing the entire population of these cen-tres in the category of commercial and industrial, we not only do not exaggerate, but rather minimise, the size of the latter, for altogether in these 8 uyezds 21,956 households cul-tivate no land at all. 
 Nevertheless, in the agriculturalgubernia we have taken, the commercial and industrial popu-lation outside the towns turns out to be not less than thatinside the towns. 
 4) N o n -A g r i c u l t u r a l O u t s i d e E m p l o y m e n t s But even if we add to the towns the factory and com-mercial and industrial villages and townships we are far from exhausting the total industrial population of Russia. 
 The lack of freedom of movement and the social-estateexclusiveness of the village community fully explain theremarkable characteristic of Russia that we have to include nosmall part of the rural population in its industrial popula-tion, that part which obtains its livelihood by working in industrial centres and spends part of the year in these cen-tres. 
 We refer to the so-called non-agricultural “outsideemployments. 
” From the official point of view, these “indus-trialists” are peasant farmers who merely have “subsidiaryemployments,” and the majority of the Narodnik economistshave, without further ado, adopted that viewpoint. 
 There is no need, after what has been said above, to prove in detail how unsound it is. 
 At all events, however much opinions onit may vary, there cannot be the slightest doubt that it indicates a diversion of the population from agriculture into commercial and industrial occupations . 
* How far this fact changes our idea of the size of the industrial population in the towns may be seen from the following example. 
 In Ka-luga Gubernia the percentage of urban population is muchlower than the average for Russia (8. 
3%, as against 12. 
8%). 
Now the Statistical Survey of that gubernia for 1896 cal-culates, on the basis of passport data, the total number of months during which migratory workers were absent from their homes. 
 It appears that the total is 1,491,600 months;divided by 12 this will give an absent population of 124,300persons, i. 
e. 
, “ nearly 11% of the total population ” (loc. 
 cit. 
, 46)! Add this number to the urban population (in 1897—97,900), and the percentage of industrial population will be a very considerable one. 
 Of course, a certain part of the migratory non-agricultural workers are registered among the existing town popula-tion, and are also part of the population of the non-urbanindustrial centres to which we have already referred. 
 Butonly a part, for owing to the mobile character of this section of the population, it is difficult to cover them by any local census; furthermore, population censuses are usuallytaken in the winter, whereas most of these industrial workersleave their homes in the spring. 
 Here are data for some ofthe principal gubernias of non-agricultural migration.

 Hence, a large part of the tem-porarily absent workers are not included in the censuses ofthe towns. 
 * But these temporary town-dwellers may also more legitimately be assigned to the urban rather than the rural population. 
 “A family which gets its livelihood through-out the year, or during the greater part of it, in the town hasfar more reason to regard the town, which provides itssubsistence, as its place of domicile than the village, withwhich it has only family and fiscal ties. 
” ** The enormous significance these fiscal ties have to this day can be seen from the fact, for instance, that among migratory Kostroma Gubernia only uyezd figures are available, and then only in percentages. 
 We had, therefore, to take the average of the uyezd fig-ures, and for this reason we give the data for Kostroma Guberniaseparately. 
 As regards Yaroslavl Gubernia, it is estimated that of themigratory industrialists 68. 
7% are absent all year round: 12. 
6% inthe autumn and winter, and 18. 
7% in the spring and summer. 
 Wewould observe that the data for Yaroslavl Gubernia ( Survey of Yaro-slavl Gubernia , Vol. 
 II, Yaroslavl, 1896) are not comparable with the preceding ones, since they are based on the statements of priests, etc. 
,and not on passport data. 
 *It is known, for instance, that in the suburbs of St. 
 Petersburg the population increases very considerably in the summer.

Male Female Male Female Pass-ports Cards Femalepassportsand cards /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR Kostroma people “it is a rare thing for peasants to get for it [the land] some small part of the taxes to be paid; usually they lease it on the sole condition that the tenants put it to use, the owner himself paying all the taxes” (D. 
 Zhbankov,Women ’s Country , Kostroma, 1891, p. 
 21). 
 In the Survey of Yaroslavl Gubernia (Vol. 
 II, Yaroslavl, 1896), we also find repeated references to migratory industrial workershaving to purchase their release from their villages and allotments (pp. 
 28, 48, 149, 150, 166 and others). 
 * How many migratory non-agricultural workers are there? The number of people engaged in all kinds of industriesemploying migratory workers is not less than from 5 to 6 millions . 
 In fact, in 1884, about 4. 
67 million passports and *“Industries employing migratory workers ... are a form that obscures the uninterrupted growth of the towns.... 
 Communal landtenure and various peculiarities of the financial and administrativelife of Russia do not allow the peasant to become a town-dweller aseasily as in the West.... 
 Legal threads sustain his (the migratoryworker’s) tie with the village, but actually by occupation, habits and tastes he has become completely assimilated with the town and often regards this tie with his village as irksome” ( Russkaya Mysl , 1896, No. 
 11, p. 
 227). 
 That is very true, but for a publicist is notenough. 
 Why did not the author declare definitely for complete free-dom of movement, for the freedom of the peasant to leave the villagecommunity? Our liberals are still afraid of our Narodniks. 
 But they have no reason to be. 
 And here, for purposes of comparison, are the views of a sympa-thiser with Narodism, Mr. 
 Zhbankov: “Migration to the towns is, as itwere, a lightning conductor (sic!) against the rapid growth of thecapitals and big cities and the increase of the urban and landless prole-tariat. 
 Both from the sanitary and from the social and economic points of view, this influence of industries employing migratory workers should be regarded as beneficial: so long as the masses of thepeople are not completely divorced from the land, which provides themigratory workers with some security” (a “security” they pay moneyto break with!), “these workers cannot become the blind instrumentsof capitalist production, and the hope remains of organising agricultural-industrial communes” ( Yuridichesky Vestnik , 1890, No. 
 9, p. 
 145). 
 Is not the retention of petty-bourgeois hopes really beneficial?As for “ blind instruments,” the experience of Europe and all the facts observed in Russia show that this description is far more applicableto the worker who retains his ties with the land and with patriarchalrelationships than to the one who has broken these ties. 
 The figures and facts given by Mr. 
 Zhbankov himself show that the migratory “Petersburger” is more literate, cultured and developed than the settledKostromer in some “backwoods” uyezd. 
 identity cards were issued in European Russia, * and pass-port revenue grew between 1884 and 1894 by more than one-third (from 3. 
3 to 4. 
5 million rubles). 
 In 1897 the totalnumber of passports and cards issued in Russia was 9,495,700 (of which 9,333,200 were issued in the 50 guber-nias of European Russia). 
 In 1898 the number was 8,259,900(European Russia, 7,809,600). 
 ** The number of workers superfluous (as compared with local demand) in European Russia has been estimated by Mr. 
 S. 
 Korolenko at 6. 
3 mil-lion. 
 Above we have seen (Chapter III, § IX, p. 
 239) that in 11 agricultural gubernias the number of passports issued exceeded Mr. 
 Korolenko’s estimate (2 million as against1. 
7 million). 
 Now we can add the data for 6 non-agricul-tural gubernias: Mr. 
 Korolenko sets the number of super-fluous workers in these at 1,287,800, while the number ofpassports issued was 1,298,600. 
 *** Thus, in 17 gubernias of European Russia (11 black-earth, plus 6 non-black-earth) there are, according to Mr. 
 Korolenko, 3 millionworkers who are superfluous (as against the local demand). 
 In the 90s, however, the number of passports and cards issued in these 17 gubernias was 3. 
3 million. 
 In 1891,these gubernias provided 52. 
2% of the total passport revenue. 
 Hence, the number of migratory workers in all probability exceeds 6 million . 
 Finally, Zemstvo statistical data (most of which are obsolete) led Mr. 
 Uvarov to the conclusion that Mr. 
 Korolenko’s figure was close to the truth, and that the figure of 5 million migratory workerswas “very highly probable.

 M. 
 Uvarov: The Influence of Industry Employing Migratory Workers on the Sanitary Conditions of Russia . 
 M. 
 Uvarov gathered the data for 126 uyezds of 20 gubernias. 
 The question now arises: how large is the number of non-agricultural and of agricultural migratory workers? Mr. 
 N. 
 —on very boldly and quite mistakenly asserts that “theoverwhelming majority of peasant outside employments are agricultural” ( Sketches , p. 
 16). 
 Chaslavsky, whom Mr. 
 N. 
 —on cites, expresses himself much more cautiously;he cites no data and limits himself to general remarks about the size of the areas which provide workers of one type or another. 
 On the other hand, Mr. 
 N. 
 —on’s railway passen-ger traffic data prove absolutely nothing, for non-agricul-tural workers also leave their homes mainly in spring and, moreover, use the railways much more than agricul-tural workers do. 
 * We presume, on the contrary, that the majority (although not the “overwhelming” majority) of the migratory workers are probably non-agricultural workers. 
This view is based, firstly, on data concerning the distri-bution of passport revenue, and, secondly, on Mr. 
 Vesin’s data. 
 Years ago Flerovsky, on the basis of the returnsfor 1862-63 showing the distribution of revenue from “mis-cellaneous duties” (more than one-third of which was obtained from the issue of passports), drew the conclusion thatthe greatest movement of peasants in search of work was from the metropolitan and the non-agricultural gubernias. 
 ** If we take the 11 non-agricultural gubernias which we com-bined above (part 2 of this section) into a single area, and which non-agricultural workers leave in large numbers, we shall see that these gubernias in 1885 contained only 18. 
7%of the population of all European Russia (in 1897—18. 
3%), whereas they accounted for 42. 
9% of the passport revenue in 1885 (in 1891—40. 
7%). 
 *** Non-agricultural workers are provided by very many other gubernias, and we must there-fore conclude that agricultural workers constitute less than half of the migrants. 
 Mr. 
 Vesin divides 38 gubernias of Euro-pean Russia (which account for 90% of the departure *Cf.

 These figures also show that there is a *The last two columns in the table have been added by us. 
 Group I includes the following gubernias: Archangel, Vladimir, Vologda,Vyatka, Kaluga, Kostroma, Moscow, Novgorod, Perm, St.

—We must mention that this classification containssome inaccuracies exaggerating the proportion of migration foragricultural work. 
 The gubernias of Smolensk, Nizhni-Novgorod and Tula should be included in group I (cf. 
 Agricultural Survey of Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia for 1896 , Chapter XI— Tula Gubernia Handbook for 1895 , Section VI, p. 
 10: the number of persons leaving for work away from their homes is given as 188,000—but Mr. 
 Koro-lenko calculated that there were only 50,000 superfluous workers!—the 6 northern, non-black-earth uyezds accounting for 107,000 mi-grants. 
) Kursk Gubernia should be included in group II (S. 
 Korolenko, loc.

 Where non-agricultural industries employing migratory workers predominate, the length of absence is much greater” ( Dyelo , 1886, No. 
 7, p. 
 134). 
 Finally, the statistics given above for excise-paying trades, etc. 
, enable us to classify the residential permits issuedin all the 50 gubernias of European Russia. 
 Making the in-dicated corrections to Mr. 
 Vesin’s classification, and dis-tributing among these same groups the 12 gubernias forwhich figures are lacking for 1884 (Olonets and Pskov gu-bernias to group I; the 9 Baltic and North-West guberniasto group II; and Astrakhan Gubernia to group III), we getthe following picture: Total residential permits issued G r o u p s o f g u b e r n i a s 1897 1898 * I.

 Thus, there can be no doubt that the mobility of the population is far greater in Russia’s non-agricultural zonethan in the agricultural. 
 The number of non-agricultural migratory workers must be greater than that of the agricul-tural, and must be not less than three million . 
 The enormous and ever-increasing growth of migra-tion is confirmed by all sources. 
 Passport revenue increased *Incidentally, the author of the survey of these data (loc. 
 cit. 
, Chapter VI, p. 
 639) ascribes the decrease in the number of passportsissued in 1898 to the drop in the migration of summer workers to thesouthern gubernias resulting from the bad harvest and the widespreaduse of machinery in agriculture. 
 This explanation is of no value what-ever, since the number of residential permits issued declined least in group III and most in group I. 
 Are the methods of registration in1897 and in 1898 comparable? ( Note to 2nd edition . 
) from 2. 
1 million rubles in 1868 (1. 
75 million rubles in 1866) to 4. 
5 million rubles in 1893-94, i. 
e. 
, it more than doubled. 
 The number of passports and identity cards issued increased in Moscow Gubernia between 1877 and 1885 by 20% (males)and 53% (females); in Tver Gubernia, between 1893 and1896 by 5. 
6%, in Kaluga Gubernia, between 1885 and 1895by 23% (and the number of months of absence by 26%);in Smolensk Gubernia, from 100,000 in 1875 to 117,000 in 1885 and 140,000 in 1895; in Pskov Gubernia, from 11,716 in 1865-1875 to 14,944 in 1876 and to 43,765 in 1896(males). 
 In Kostroma Gubernia, in 1868, 23. 
8 passports andcards per 100 males were issued and 0. 
85 per 100 females,and in 1880—33.

 And so on and so forth. 
 Like the diversion of the population from agriculture to the towns, non-agricultural migration is a progressive phenomenon . 
 It tears the population out of the neglected, backward, history-forgotten remote spots and draws theminto the whirlpool of modern social life. 
 It increases liter-acy among the population, * heightens their understanding, ** and gives them civilised habits and requirements.

, 34), so that infec-tious diseases are not so fatal among them as in the “ little-cultured ” volosts (author’s italics). 
 *** “The uyezds from which there is migration are much supe-rior to the agricultural and forest localities in the arrangement of their lives.... 
 The clothes of the Petersburgers are much cleaner, smarter and more hygienic.... 
 The children are kept cleaner, and thatis why the itch and other skin diseases are not so frequent among them”(ibid. 
, 39. 
 Cf. 
 Industries Employing Migratory Workers in Smolensk Gubernia , p. 
 8). 
 “The villages from which there is migration differ considerably from those from which there is none: houses, clothes, habits and amusements remind one more of town than of village life” (Industries Employing Migratory Workers in Smolensk Gubernia , p. 
 3). 
 In the volosts of Kostroma Gubernia from which there is mi-gration “you find paper, ink, pencils and pens in half the houses”(Women ’s Country , 67-68). 
 The peasants are induced to migrate by “motives of a higher order,” i. 
e. 
, by the greater smartness and polish of the Petersburger; they look for places where “things are better. 
” “Life and work in Petersburg are considered to beeasier than in the country. 
” * “All country-folk are called raw , and the strange thing is that they are not in the least offended at this, but refer to themselves as such and com-plain that their parents did not send them to St. 
 Petersburg to study. 
 It should be stated, however, that these raw coun-try people are not nearly so raw as those in the purelyagricultural districts; they unconsciously copy the outwardappearance and the habits of the Petersburgers; the lightof the metropolis falls indirectly on them. 
” ** In Yaroslavl Gubernia (apart from examples of people growing rich) “there is still another cause which drives everyone from his home. 
 That is—public opinion, which dubs a bumpkin tothe end of his days anybody who has not lived in Peters-burg, or somewhere else, but engages in agriculture or somehandicraft, and such a man finds it hard to get a wife”( Survey of Yaroslavl Gubernia , II, 118). 
 Migration to the town elevates the peasant as a citizen, releasing him from the host of patriarchal and personal relationships of depend-ence and social-estate divisions so strongly entrenched in the rural districts. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 *** “A prime factor that fosters migra-tion is the growing sense of human dignity among the peo-ple. 
 Liberation from serf dependence, and the long-standing association of the more active section of the rural popula-tion with town life, have long since roused the desire in the Yaroslavl peasant to uphold his ‘ego,’ to get away from the state of poverty and dependence to which rural life has doomed him, to a state of sufficiency, independence and respect. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 The peasant who lives on outside earnings feels freer and more on a level of equality with people belonging to other social estates, which is why the rural *Women ’s Country , 26-27, 15.

, 58). 
 youth are so eager to go to the town” ( Survey of Yaroslavl Gubernia , II, 189-190). 
 Migration to the towns loosens the old patriarchal family ties and places women in a more independent position, onan equal footing with men. 
 “Compared with those in thelocalities of no migration, the families of Soligalich andChukhloma” (the uyezds of Kostroma Gubernia wheremigration is greatest) “are much less closely knit, not only in the sense of the patriarchal authority of the older, but even in the relations between parents and children, husband andwife. 
 One cannot, of course, expect strong affection for theirparents and attachment to the parental home from sonswho are sent to Petersburg from the age of 12; unconsciouslythey become cosmopolitans: ‘where it is well, there is my country. 
’” * “Accustomed to dispense with the authority and assistance of her husband, the Soligalich woman is quiteunlike the downtrodden peasant woman of the agriculturalzone: she is independent and self-reliant. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 Wife-beating isa rare exception here. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 Generally speaking, equalitybetween women and men is to be observed almost everywhere and in all things. 
” ** Last but not least, *** non-agricultural migration raises the wages not only of the wage-workers who migrate but also of those who stay behind . 
 This fact is most strikingly reflected in the general cir-cumstance that the non-agricultural gubernias where wages are higher than in the agricultural gubernias, attract agricultural workers from the latter.

 “These figures fully illustrate the phenomena . 
 . 
 . 
 1) that migration for work in industry helps to raise wages in agriculture, and 2) that it attracts the best forces of the popu-lation. 
” * Not only money wages, but real wages also rise. 
 In the group of uyezds from which not fewer than 60out of every 100 working people migrate the average wageof the farm labourer employed by the year is 69 rubles, or123 poods of rye; in the uyezds where from 40 to 60% migrate, it is 64 rubles, or 125 poods of rye; in the uyezds which supply less than 40% of the migrants, it is 59 rubles, or116 poods of rye. 
 ** In these same groups of uyezds the per-centage of letters of complaint about a shortage of laboursteadily drops: 58%, 42% and 35%. 
 In manufacturing industrywages are higher than in agriculture, and “the industries, according to the statements of numerous correspondents, help to develop new requirements (tea, calico, boots, clocks,etc. 
) among the peasant population, raise their generalstandard of living, and in this way bring about a rise inwages. 
” *** Here is a typical view by a correspondent: “The shortage [of labour] is always acute, and the reason is that the suburban population is spoilt, it works in the rail-way workshops and serves on the railways. 
 The nearness ofKaluga and its markets always attract the surroundinginhabitants, who come to sell eggs, milk, etc. 
, and thenengage in orgies of drunkenness in the taverns; the reasonis that everybody wants to get the highest pay for the least work. 
 To be an agricultural labourer is considered a dis-grace : all strive to get to the town, where they swell the ranks of the proletariat and the riff-raff; the countryside, on the other hand, suffers from a shortage of capable and healthy labourers. 
” **** We would be quite justified in describing this appraisal of industries employing migratory workersas Narodist . 
 Mr. 
 Zhbankov, for instance, while pointing out that those who migrate are not superfluous but “neces-sary” workers whose places are taken by entering peasants,considers it “obvious” that “such mutual replacements are *Statistical Survey of Kaluga Gubernia for 1896 , Sec.

 very disadvantageous. 
” * For whom, dear Mr. 
 Zhbankov? “Life in the capitals cultivates many civilised habits of the lower order and an inclination to luxury and showiness, and this results in a useless (sic!!) waste of money” **, the expend-iture on this showiness, etc. 
, is largely “unproductive” (!!) *** Mr. 
 Hertzenstein positively howls about the “sham culture,”“the riotous living,” “wild carousing,” “orgies of drunkennessand filthy debauchery,” etc. 
 **** From the fact of whole-sale migration the Moscow statisticians draw the outright conclusion that it is necessary to take “measures that woulddiminish the need for migratory labour. 
”( *) Mr. 
 Karyshev argues about migratory labour as follows: “Only an increasein the peasants’ holdings to a size sufficient to provide themain (!) requirements of their families can solve this most serious problem of our national economy. 
( **) And it does not occur to any of these serene-spirited gentlemen that before talking about “solving most seriousproblems,” one must see to it that the peasants obtain com-plete freedom of movement, freedom to give up their landand leave the community, freedom to settle (without having *Women ’s Country , 39 and 8. 
 “Will not these genuine peasants (newly-entered) exert a sobering influence, by the prosperous life they lead, upon the native population, who regard not the land but employment away from home as their main source of livelihood?”(p. 
 40). 
 “Incidentally,” remarks the author sadly, “we have alreadycited an example of the opposite influence. 
” Here is the example. 
Vologda folk bought land and lived “very prosperously. 
” “In replyto the question I put to one of them as to why, though well-off, he let his son go to St. 
 Petersburg, he said: ‘It’s true we are not poor, but life is very dull here, and my son, seeing others go, wanted to geteducated himself; at home too he was the one with knowledge’”(p.

 Poor Narodniks! How can they help deploring the fact thateven the example of well-to-do, land-purchasing muzhik farmercannot “sober” the youth, who, in their desire to “get educated,” flee from the “allotment that secures them their livelihood”! **The Influence of Industries Employing Migratory Workers , etc.

 So then, the “main” requirements are to be met by the allotment, and the rest apparentlyby “local employments” secured in the “countryside,” which “suffersfrom a shortage of capable and healthy labourers”! to pay “riddance” money) in any community, urban or rural, whatsoever! And so the diversion of the population from agriculture is expressed, in Russia, in the growth of the towns (a growthpartly obscured by home colonisation), suburbs, factoryand commercial and industrial villages and townships, as well as in non-agricultural migration. 
 All these processes, which have been and are rapidly developing in breadthand depth in the post-Reform period, are necessarycomponents of capitalist development and are profoundlyprogressive as compared with the old forms of life. 
 III. 
 THE GROWTH OF THE EMPLOYMENT OF WAGE-LABOUR In considering the development of capitalism, perhaps the greatest importance attaches to the extent to whichwage-labour is employed. 
 Capitalism is that stage in the development of commodity-production in which labour-power, too, becomes a commodity. 
 The main tendency ofcapitalism is to apply the sum-total of labour-power in thenational economy to production only after it has been soldand has been purchased by the employers. 
 Above, wemade an attempt to show in detail how this tendency has manifested itself in post-Reform Russia; now, we must draw the necessary conclusions. 
 Firstly, let us compute thedata on the number of sellers of labour-power given inthe preceding chapters and then (in the next section)describe the purchasers of labour-power. 
 The sellers of labour-power are provided by the country’s working population engaged in the production of material values. 
 It is estimated that this population numbers about15. 
5 million adult male workers. 
 * In Chapter II we showed *The figure given in the Combined Statistical Material , etc. 
 (published by Chancellory of the Committee of Ministers, 1894), is15,546,618. 
 This figure was reached in the following way. 
 The urban population was taken as equal to the population not participating in the production of material values. 
 The adult male peasant popula-tion was reduced by 7% (4. 
5% on military service and 2. 
5% incivilian service). 
 that the bottom group of the peasantry is nothing else than a rural proletariat; and we stated (p. 
 177, footnote) that the forms in which this proletariat sells its labour-power would be examined later. 
 Let us now combine the categories ofwage-workers previously enumerated: 1) agricultural wage-workers. 
 These number about 3 2 million (in European Russia). 
 2) Factory, mining and railway workers—about1 2 million. 
 Total, five million professional wage-workers. 
 Further: 3) building workers—about 1 million. 
 4) Lumber workers (tree-fellers, log trimmers, rafters, etc. 
), navvies,railway builders, goods loaders and unloaders, and in gen-eral all kinds of “unskilled” labourers in industrial centres. 
These number about 2 million. 
 * 5) Workers occupied at home for capitalists, and also those working for wages in the manufacturing industries not included in “factory industry. 
” These number about 2 million. 
 Total— about ten million wage-workers . 
 If we deduct the women and children, say one-fourth, ** we get 72 million adult male wage-workers , i. 
e. 
, about half the total adult male population that is engaged in the production of material values *** in the country. 
 Part of this vast mass of wage-workers have completely broken with the land, andlive entirely by the sale of their labour-power. 
 They includethe great majority of factory (undoubtedly also of miningand railway) workers, then a section of the building andshipbuilding workers, and unskilled labourers; finally, a fairly large section of the workers employed in capitalist *Above we saw that lumber workers alone are estimated at about 2 million. 
 The number of workers employed in the last two groups of occupations we have indicated should be larger than the total number of non-agricultural migratory workers, for part of thebuilding workers, unskilled labourers, particularly lumber workersare local and not migratory workers. 
 And we have seen that the numberof non-agricultural migratory workers is not less than 3 million. 
 **In factory industry, as we have seen, women and children constitute a little over 4 of the total number of workers. 
 In the mining, building and lumber industries, etc. 
, few women and childrenare employed. 
 In capitalist domestic industry, on the other hand,they are probably more numerous than men. 
 *** To avoid misunderstanding, let us make the reservation that we do not claim these figures to be statistically exact. 
 We merely wish to show approximately the diversity of the forms of wage-labour and the numbers of those engaged in it. 
 manufactories and the inhabitants of non-agricultural cen-tres engaged in home work for capitalists. 
 The other, and larger, section has not yet broken with the land, covers its expenditures in part with the produce that comes from farm-ing tiny plots of land, and, consequently, forms the typeof allotment-holding wage-worker which we attempted todescribe in detail in Chapter II. 
 In earlier remarks it wasshown that this vast mass of wage-workers has been formed mainly in the post-Reform period and that it continues to grow rapidly. 
 It is important to note the significance of our conclusion regarding the relative surplus-population (or reserve armyof unemployed) created by capitalism. 
 The data regardingthe total number of wage-workers in all branches of the national economy bring out very clearly the basic error committed by the Narodnik economists on this point. 
As we have had occasion to observe elsewhere ( Studies , pp. 
 38-42), * this error lies in the fact that the Narodnik economists (Messrs. 
 V. 
 V. 
, N. 
 —on and others), who have talked a great deal about capitalism “freeing” the workers, have not thought of investigating the concrete forms of capitalist over-population in Russia; as well as in the factthat they failed completely to understand that the veryexistence and development of capitalism in this countryrequire an enormous mass of reserve workers. 
 By means ofpaltry phrases and curious calculations as to the number of “factory” workers, ** they have transformed one of the basic conditions for the development of capitalism into proof *Cf. 
 present edition, Vol. 
 2, “A Characterisation of Economic Romanticism. 
”— Ed. 
 **Let us recall the argument of Mr. 
 N. 
 —on about the “handful” of workers, and also the following, truly classic, calculation by Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
 ( Essays on Theoretical Economics , p. 
 131). 
 In the 50 gubernias of European Russia there are 15,547,000 adult male workers belongingto the peasant estate; of these, 1,020,000 (863,000 in factory industry # 160,000 railway workers) are “united by capital”; the rest are the“agricultural population. 
” With the “complete capitalisation of the manufacturing industries” “capitalist factory industry” will employ twice as many hands (13. 
3% in place of 7. 
6%, while the remaining86. 
7% of the population “will remain on the land and be idle duringhalf the year”). 
 Obviously, comment could only spoil the impressioncreated by this wonderful specimen of economic science and economic statistics. 
 that capitalism is impossible, is an error, is devoid of foun-dation, etc. 
 Actually, however, Russian capitalism could never have developed to its present level, could not have survived a single year, had the expropriation of the smallproducers not created an army of many millions of wage-workers ready at the first call to satisfy the maximum demandof the employers in agriculture, lumbering, building,commerce and in the manufacturing, mining, and transport industries, etc. 
 We say the maximum demand, because cap-italism can only develop spasmodically, and consequently,the number of producers who need to sell their labour-power must always exceed capitalism’s average demand forworkers. 
 We have now estimated the total number of thevarious categories of wage-workers, but in doing so do not wish to say that capitalism is in a position to give regular employment to them all. 
 There is not, nor can there be,such regularity of employment in capitalist society, which-ever category of wage-worker we take. 
 Of the millions ofmigratory and resident workers a certain section is constant-ly in the reserve army of unemployed, and this reserve army now swells to enormous dimensions—in years of crisis, or if there is a slump in some industry in a particular district,or if there is a particularly rapid extension of machine pro-duction, which displaces workers—and now shrinks to aminimum, even causing that “shortage” of labour which isoften the subject of complaint by employers in some indus-tries, in some years, in some parts of the country. 
 It is impossible to determine even approximately the number ofunemployed in an average year, owing to the completeabsence of anything like reliable statistics; but there isno doubt that the number must be a very large one, as isevidenced by both the tremendous fluctuations in capitalist industry, trade and agriculture, to which repeated reference was made above, and by the usual deficits in the budg-ets of the bottom-group peasants recorded by Zemstvostatistics. 
 The increase in the number of peasants throwninto the ranks of the industrial and rural proletar-iat, and the increase in the demand for wage-labour, are two sides of one medal. 
 As for the forms of wage-labour, they are extremely diverse in n capitalist society still every-where enmeshed in survivals and institutions of the pre-capitalist regime. 
 It is a profound error to ignore this diversity of forms, and that is the error of those who, like Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
, argue that capitalism has “fenced off a corner for itself with some one to one-and-a-half million workersand never emerges from it. 
” * Here we have large-scale machine industry instead of capitalism. 
 But how arbitrarily andhow artificially are these million and a half workers fencedoff into a special “corner” that is supposedly in no way con-nected with the remaining spheres of wage-labour! As a matter of fact, the connection is a very close one, and it willbe sufficient, in order to characterise it, to mention twobasic features of the present economic system. 
 Firstly, thissystem is based on money economy. 
 The “power of money”manifests itself in full force in both industry and agricul-ture, in both town and country, but it reaches its full development, completely eliminates the remnants of patri-archal economy, is concentrated in a few gigantic institutions(banks) and is directly connected with large-scale socialproduction only in the sphere of large-scale machine indus-try. 
 Secondly, the economic system of today is based on the purchase and sale of labour-power. 
 If we take even the smallest producers in agriculture or in industry, we willfind that the one who does not hire himself out, or himselfhire others, is the exception. 
 But here again, these relation-ships reach full development and become completely sep-arated from previous forms of economy only in large-scale machine industry. 
 Hence, the “corner” which seems so small to some Narodnik actually embodies the quintessence ofmodern social relationships, and the population of this “cor-ner,” i. 
e. 
, the proletariat, is, in the literal sense of the word,the vanguard of the whole mass of toilers and exploited. 
 ** *Novoye Slovo , 1896, No. 
 6, p. 
 21. 
 **Mutatis mutandis, the same may be said of the relation between wage-workers in large-scale machine industry and the rest ofthe wage-workers as the Webbs say of the relation between trade union-ists in Britain and non-unionists: “The trade unionists number about 4 per cent of the total population ... the trade unionists number about20 per cent of the adult male manual working class. 
” But “Die Gewerk-schaftler ... zählen ... in der Regel die Elite des Gewerbes in ihrenReihen. 
 Der moralische und geistige Einfluss, den sie auf die Masseihrer Berufsgenossen ausüben, steht deshalb ausser jedem Verhältniss zu ihrer numerischen Stärke” (S. 
 & B. 
 Webb: Die Geschichte des britischen Therefore, only by examining the whole of the present eco-nomic system from the angle of the relationships that have grown up in this “corner” can one become clear about the main relations between the various groups of persons takingpart in production, and, consequently, trace the system’smain trend of development. 
 On the other hand, whoeverturns his back on this “corner” and examines economicphenomena from the angle of petty patriarchal produc-tion, is turned by the march of history into either an innocent dreamer or an ideologist of the petty bourgeoisie and the agrarians. 
 IV. 
 THE FORMATION OF A HOME MARKET FOR LABOUR-POWER To sum up the data given earlier on this problem we shall confine ourselves to the picture of the movement of workers over the territory of European Russia. 
 Such a picture issupplied by the Department of Agriculture’s publication * based on statements by employers. 
 The picture of the move-ment of workers will give a general idea of how the homemarket for labour-power is being formed; using the mate-rial of the publication mentioned, we have only tried todraw a distinction between the movement of agriculturaland non-agricultural workers, although the map appended to the publication and illustrating the movement of the workers does not show this distinction. 
 The main movements of agricultural workers are the following: 1) From the central agricultural gubernias to Trade Unionismus , Stuttgart, Dietz, 1895, S. 
 S. 
 363, 365, 381) [“the trade unionists ... include, as a general rule, the picked men in each trade. 
 The moral and intellectual influence which they exerciseon the rest of their class is, therefore, out of all proportion to theirnumbers.

 and B.

 the southern and eastern outer regions. 
 2) From the northern black-earth gubernias to the southern black-earth gubernias, from which, in turn, the workers go to the border regions (cf. 
 Chapter III, §IX, pp. 
 237-238 and §X, pp. 
 242-243). 
3) From the central agricultural gubernias to the indus-trial gubernias (cf. 
 Chapter IV, §IV, pp. 
 270-271). 
 4) From thecentral and the south-western agricultural gubernias to thearea of sugar-beet plantations (workers come in part to these places even from Galicia). 
 The main movements of non-agricultural workers are: 1) To the metropolitan cities and the large towns, chieflyfrom the non-agricultural gubernias, but to a considerabledegree also from the agricultural gubernias. 
 2) To theindustrial area, to the factories of Vladimir, Yaroslavl and other gubernias from the same localities. 
 3) To new centres of industry or to new branches of industry, to centresof non-factory industry, etc. 
 These include the movement:a) to the beet-sugar refineries of the south-western guber-nias; b) to the southern mining area; c) to jobs at thedocks (Odessa, Rostov-on-Don, Riga, etc. 
); d) to the peat beds in Vladimir and other gubernias; e) to the mining and metallurgical area of the Urals; f) to the fisheries (Astrakhan,the Black Sea, Azov Sea, etc. 
); g) to shipbuilding, sailor-ing, lumbering and rafting jobs, etc. 
; h) to jobs on therailways, etc. 
 These are the main movements of the workers which, according to the evidence of employers, more or less mate-rially affect the conditions of labour hire in the variouslocalities. 
 To appreciate more clearly the significance ofthese movements, let us compare them with the data onwages in the various districts from and to which theworkers migrate. 
 Confining ourselves to 28 gubernias in European Russia, we divide these into 6 groups according to the character of the movement of workers, and get thefollowing data: * *The other gubernias are omitted in order not to complicate our exposition with data that contribute nothing new to the subjectunder examination; furthermore, the other gubernias are eitheruntouched by the main, mass, movements of workers (Urals, the North)or have their specific ethnographical, administrative and juridicalfeatures (the Baltic gubernias, the gubernias in the Jewish Pale of Average wages for 10 years (1881-1891) Extent of movement of workers of annualworker Groups of guberniaAgricultural Non-agricultural according to char-acter of movementof workersInflux Departure Influx RublesRublesKopeks 1.

 Two main areas, thosemost developed capitalistically, attract vast numbers ofworkers: the area of agricultural capitalism (the southernand the eastern outer regions), and the area of industrialcapitalism (the metropolitan and the industrial gubernias). 
Wages are lowest in the area of departure, the central agri-cultural gubernias, where capitalism, both in agriculture and in industry, is least developed *; in the influx areas, on the other hand, wages rise for all types of work, asdoes also the percentage of money wage to total wage, i. 
e. 
,money economy gains ground at the expense of naturaleconomy. 
 The intermediary areas, those between theareas of the greatest influx (and of the highest wages)and the area of departure (and of the lowest wages) revealthe mutual replacement of workers to which reference wasmade above: workers leave in such numbers that in theplaces of departure a shortage of labour is created whichattracts workers from the more “poorly paid” gubernias. 
 In essence, the two-sided process shown in our table— that of the diversion of population from agriculture toindustry (industrialisation of the population) and of thedevelopment of commercial-industrial, capitalist agricul-ture (industrialisation of agriculture)—epitomises all that Settlement, the Byelorussian gubernias, etc. 
). 
 Data from the pub-lication cited above. 
 Wage figures are the average for the gubernias in the respective groups; the day labourer’s summer wage is the average for three seasons: sowing, haymaking and harvesting. 
 The areas(1 to 6) include the following gubernias: 1) Taurida, Bessarabia and Don; 2) Kherson, Ekaterinoslav, Samara, Saratov, Orenburg; 3) Simbirsk, Voronezh, Kharkov; 4) Kazan, Penza, Tambov, Ryazan,Tula, Orel, Kursk; 5) Pskov, Novgorod, Kaluga, Kostroma, Tver, Nizhni-Novgorod; 6) St. 
 Petersburg, Moscow, Yaroslavl, Vladimir. 
 *Thus, the peasants flee in mass from the localities where pat-riarchal economic relationships are most prevalent, where labour-service and primitive forms of industry are preserved to the greatest extent, to localities where the “pillars” are completely decayed. 
 They flee from “people’s production” and pay no heed to the chorus of voicesfrom “society” following in their wake. 
 In this chorus two voices can be clearly distinguished: “They have little attachment!” comes the menacing bellow of the Black-Hundred Sobakevich. 
 163 “They have insufficient allotment land!” is the polite correction of the Cadet Manilov. 
 has been said above on the formation of a home market for capitalist society. 
 The home market for capitalism is created by the parallel development of capitalism in agri-culture and in industry, * by the formation of a class of rural and industrial employers, on the one hand, and of aclass of rural and industrial wage-workers, on the other. 
The main streams of the movement of workers show the mainforms of this process, but by far not all the forms; in what has gone before we have shown that the forms of this process differ in peasant and in landlord farming, in thedifferent areas of commercial agriculture, in the differentstages of the capitalist development of industry, etc. 
 How far this process is distorted and confused by the representatives of Narodnik economics is seen most clearly in §VI of Part 2 of Mr. 
 N. 
 —on’s Sketches , which bears the significant heading: “The Influence of the Redis-tribution of the Social Productive Forces upon the EconomicPosition of the Agricultural Population. 
” Here is howMr. 
 N. 
 —on pictures this “redistribution”: “.

 society, every increase in the productive power of labour entails the ‘freeing’ of a corresponding number of workers, who are compelled to seek some other employment;and since this occurs in all branches of production, and this‘freeing’ takes place over the whole of capitalist society,the only thing left open to them is to turn to the means ofproduction of which they have not yet been deprived, namely, the land” (p. 
 126). 
 .

 . 
 “Our peasants have not been deprived of the land, and that is why they turn their efforts towardsit. 
 When they lose their employment in the factory, or areobliged to abandon their subsidiary domestic occupations,they see no other course but to set about the increasedexploitation of the soil. 
 All Zemstvo statistical returns *Theoretical economics established this simple truth long ago. 
 To say nothing of Marx, who pointed directly to the development of capitalism in agriculture as a process that creates a “home market forindustrial capital” ( Das Kapital , I 2, S. 
 776, Chapter 24, Sec. 
 5),164 let us refer to Adam Smith. 
 In chapter XI of Book I and Chapter IV of Book III of The Wealth of Nations , he pointed to the most charac-teristic features of the development of capitalist agriculture and noted the parallelism of this process with the process of the growth of the towns and the development of industry. 
 note the fact that the area under cultivation is grow-ing. 
 .

” (128). 
 As you see, Mr. 
 N. 
 —on knows of quite a special sort of capitalism that has never existed anywhere and that noeconomist could conceive of. 
 Mr. 
 N. 
 —on’s capitalism does not divert the population from agriculture to industry,does not divide the agriculturists into opposite classes. 
Quite the contrary. 
 Capitalism “frees” the workers from industry and there is nothing left for “them” to do but to turn to the land, for “our peasants have not been deprived ofthe land”!! At the bottom of this “theory,” which originally“redistributes” in poetic disorder all the processes of capi-talist development, lie the ingenious tricks of all Narodnikswhich we have examined in detail previously: they lump together the peasant bourgeoisie and the rural proletariat; they ignore the growth of commercial farming; they concoctstories about “people’s” “handicraft industries” beingisolated from “capitalist” “factory industry,” instead ofanalysing the consecutive forms and diverse manifestationsof capitalism in industry. 
 V. 
 T HE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE BORDER REGIONS. 
 HOME OR FOREIGN MARKET? In Chapter I we pointed to the erroneous character of the theory that links the problem of a foreign market for cap-italism with that of the realisation of the product (pp. 
 64-65and foll. 
). 
 Capitalism’s need of a foreign market is by nomeans to be explained by the impossibility of realising theproduct on the home market, but by the circumstance thatcapitalism is in no position to go on repeating the same processes of production on the former scale, under unchanging conditions (as was the case under pre-capitalist regimes),and that it inevitably leads to an unlimited growth ofproduction which overflows the old, narrow limits of earliereconomic units. 
 With the unevenness of development inher-ent in capitalism, one branch of production outstrips the others and strives to transcend the bounds of the old field of economic relations. 
 Let us take, for example, the textile indus-try at the beginning of the post-Reform period. 
 Being fairly well developed capitalistically (manufacture beginning to pass into factory industry), it had gained complete command of the market of Central Russia. 
 But the big factories, grow-ing so rapidly, could no longer be satisfied with the formerdimensions of the market; they began to seek a marketfurther afield, among the new population colonising Novo-rossia, the south-east Transvolga region, North Caucasus,then Siberia, etc. 
 The efforts of the big factories to reach out beyond the old markets are undoubted. 
 Does it mean that the areas which served as these old markets could not, ingeneral, consume a larger quantity of the products of thetextile industry? Does it mean, for example, that theindustrial and central agricultural gubernias cannot, ingeneral, absorb a larger quantity of wares? No, it does not. 
 We know that the differentiation of the peasantry, the growth of commercial agriculture and the increase in theindustrial population have also expanded, and continue toexpand, the home market of this old area. 
 But this expan-sion of the home market is retarded by many factors (chiefamong them the retention of obsolete institutions which hinder the development of agricultural capitalism); and the factory owners will not, of course, wait until the capitalistdevelopment of other branches of the national economycatches up with that of the textile industry. 
 The mill ownersneed a market at once, and if the backwardness of otherbranches of the national economy restricts the market in the old area, they will seek for a market in another area, or in other countries, or in the colonies of the old country. 
 What is a colony in the politico-economic sense? It was stated above that, according to Marx, the mainfeatures of this concept are the following: 1) the exist-ence of unoccupied, free lands, easily accessible to settlers; 2) the existence of an established world division of labour, of a world market, thanks to which the colonies can specialisein the mass production of agricultural produce, receiving in exchange finished industrial goods “which they would have to produce themselves under other circumstances” (seeabove, p. 
 258, footnote, Chapter IV, §II). 
 Reference has been made elsewhere to the fact that the southern and the eastern border regions of European Russia, whichhave been settled in the post-Reform period, bear the distinctive features mentioned and constitute, in the eco-nomic sense, colonies of Central European Russia. 
 * The term colony is still more applicable to the other outer regions, for example, the Caucasus. 
 Its economic “conquest” byRussia took place much later than the political conquest;and to this day this economic conquest has not been com-pleted to the full. 
 In the post-Reform period there has been,on the one hand, an intensive colonisation of the Caucasus, ** an extensive ploughing up of the land (particularly in theNorth Caucasus) by colonists producing wheat, tobacco,etc. 
, for sale, and attracting masses of rural wage-workersfrom Russia. 
 On the other hand, native age-old “handi-craft” industries, which are declining due to the competitionof wares from Moscow, are being eliminated. 
 There has been a decline in the ancient gunsmith’s craft due to the competition of imported Tula and Belgian wares, a decline inhandicraft iron-work due to the competition of the importedRussian products, as well as in the handicraft processing ofcopper, gold and silver, clay, fats and soda, leather, etc. 
 *** These products are turned out more cheaply in Russian fac-tories, which supply the Caucasus with their wares. 
 There has been a decline in the making of drinking-horns becauseof the decay of the feudal system in Georgia and of thesteady disappearance of her memorable feasts; there hasbeen a decline in the headgear industry due to the replace-ment of Asiatic dress by European; there has been a decline in the production of wine-skins and pitchers for local wine, which for the first time is now being sold (giving rise to thebarrel-making trade) and has in turn captured the Rus-*“... It was thanks exclusively to them, thanks to these forms of people’s production, and on the basis of them that the whole of South Russia was colonised and settled. 
” (Mr. 
 N. 
 —on, Sketches , 284). 
 How wonderfully broad and comprehensive is the term: “forms ofpeople’s production”! It covers whatever you like: patriarchal peasant farming, labour-service, primitive handicrafts, small commodity-production, and those typically capitalist relations within thepeasant community that we saw above in the data on the Taurida and Samara gubernias (Chapter II), etc. 
, etc. 
 **Cf.

 P.

 sian market. 
 Russian capitalism has thus been drawing the Caucasus into the sphere of world commodity circulation, obliterating its local peculiarities—the remnants of ancient patriarchal isolation—and providing itself with a market for its factories. 
 A country thinly populated at thebeginning of the post-Reform period, or populated by moun-taineers living outside world economy and even outsidehistory, has been turning into a land of oil industrialists, wine merchants, big wheat and tobacco growers, and Mr. 
 Coupo n has been ruthlessly divesting the proud moun-taineer of his picturesque national costume and dressing himin the livery of a European flunkey (Gleb Uspensky). 
 166 The process of rapid colonisation in the Caucasus and of therapid growth of its agricultural population has been accom-panied by a process (obscured by this growth) of the diver-sion of the population from agriculture to industry. 
 Theurban population of the Caucasus increased from 350,000 in1863 to about 900,000 in 1897 (the total population increasedbetween 1851 and 1897 by 95%). 
 There is no need to addthat the same thing has taken place and continues in both Central Asia and Siberia, etc. 
 Thus, the question naturally arises, where is the border-line between the home and the foreign market? To take the political boundaries of the state would be too mechani-cal a solution—and would it be a solution? If Central Asia is the home market and Persia the foreign market, to which category do Khiva and Bokhara belong? If Siberia is the home market and China the foreign market, to whichcategory does Manchuria belong? Such questions are not ofgreat importance. 
 What is important is that capitalismcannot exist and develop without constantly expanding thesphere of its domination, without colonising new countries and drawing old non-capitalist countries into the whirl-pool of world economy. 
 And this feature of capitalism hasbeen and continues to be manifested with tremendous forcein post-Reform Russia. 
 Hence, the process of the formation of a market for capitalism has two aspects, namely, the development of capitalism in depth, i. 
e. 
, the further growth of capitalist agriculture and industry in the given, definite and enclosedterritory—and the development of capitalism in breadth,165 i. 
e. 
, the extension of the sphere of the capitalist domination to new territory. 
 In accordance with the plan of the present work, we have confined ourselves almost exclusively to the first aspect of the process, and for this reason weconsider it particularly necessary to stress the point herethat its other aspect is of exceptionally great importance. 
Anything like a complete study of the process of colonisa-tion of the border regions and of the expansion of Russian territory, from the point of view of capitalist development, would require a special work. 
 Suffice it to mention herethat Russia is in a particularly favoured position ascompared with other capitalist countries, due to the abun-dance of free land accessible for colonisation in her borderregions. 
 * To say nothing of Asiatic Russia we have also in European Russia border regions which, because of their exceeding remoteness and bad means of communication,are still very poorly connected economically with centralRussia. 
 Let us take, for instance, the “Far North”—ArchangelGubernia; the boundless stretches of territory and theirnatural resources are still exploited very slightly. 
 One of the principal local products, timber, was until recently exported mainly to England. 
 In this respect, therefore, that partof European Russia was a foreign market for Britain with-out being a home market for Russia. 
 The Russian entre-*The circumstance indicated in the text has another aspect. 
 The development of capitalism in depth in the old, long-inhabited terri-tories is retarded because of the colonisation of the outer regions. 
 The solution of the contradictions inherent in, and produced by, capital-ism is temporarily postponed because of the fact that capitalism can easily develop in breadth. 
 Thus, the simultaneous existence of the most advanced forms of industry and of semi-medieval forms of agriculture is undoubtedly a contradiction. 
 If Russian capitalism had possessed no range for expansion beyond the bounds of the territory already occupied at the beginning of the post-Reform period, this contradiction between capitalist large-scale industry and the archaic institutions in rural life (the tying of the peasants to the land, etc. 
) would have had to lead quickly to the complete abolition of these institutions, to the complete clearing of the path for agricultural capitalism in Russia. 
 But the possibility (for the mill owner) of seek-ing and finding a market in the outer regions in process of colonisation and the possibility (for the peasant) of moving to new territory, mitigates the acuteness of this contradiction and delays its solution. 
 It goes without saying that such a deceleration of the growth of capitalism is equivalent to preparing its even greater extension in the near future. 
 preneurs naturally envied the British, and now, with the extension of the railway line to Archangel, they are jubilant at the prospect of “elevated moods and business activity in various branches of industry in the region. 
” * VI. 
 THE “MISSION” OF CAPITALISM We still have, in conclusion, to sum up on the question which in literature has come to be known as that of the“mission” of capitalism, i. 
e. 
, of its historical role in theeconomic development of Russia. 
 Recognition of the pro-gressiveness of this role is quite compatible (as we havetried to show in detail at every stage in our exposition ofthe facts) with the full recognition of the negative and dark sides of capitalism, with the full recognition of the profound and all-round social contradictions which are inevitablyinherent in capitalism, and which reveal the historically tran-sient character of this economic regime. 
 It is the Narodniks—who exert every effort to show that an admission of the his-torically progressive nature of capitalism means an apology for capitalism—who are at fault in underrating (and some-times in even ignoring) the most profound contradictionsof Russian capitalism, by glossing over the differentiationof the peasantry, the capitalist character of the evolution of our agriculture, and the rise of a class of rural and indus-trial allotment-holding wage-labourers, by glossing over the complete predominance of the lowest and worst forms ofcapitalism in the celebrated “handicraft” industries. 
 The progressive historical role of capitalism may be summed up in two brief propositions: increase in theproductive forces of social labour, and the socialisation of that labour. 
 But both these facts manifest themselves in ex-tremely diverse processes in different branches of the nationaleconomy. 
 The development of the productive forces of social labour is to be observed in full relief only in the epoch of large-scalemachine industry. 
 Until that highest stage of capitalism was tive technique, which developed quite spontaneously and exceedingly slowly. 
 The post-Reform epoch differs radi-reached, there still remained hand production and primi-cally in this respect from previous epochs in Russian history. 
 The Russia of the wooden plough and the flail, of the water-mill and the hand-loom, began rapidly to be transformed into the Russia of the iron plough and the threshing machine,of the steam-mill and the power-loom. 
 An equally thoroughtransformation of technique is seen in every branch of thenational economy where capitalist production predominates. 
This process of transformation must, by the very nature of capitalism, take place in the midst of much that is uneven and disproportionate: periods of prosperity alternate withperiods of crisis, the development of one industry leads tothe decline of another, there is progress in one aspect ofagriculture in one area and in another aspect in anotherarea, the growth of trade and industry outstrips the growth of agriculture, etc. 
 A large number of errors made by Narod-nik writers spring from their efforts to prove that thisdisproportionate, spasmodic, feverish development is notdevelopment. 
 * Another feature of the development by capitalism of the social productive forces is that the growth of the means of production (productive consumption) outstrips by far the growth of personal consumption: we have indicated onmore than one occasion how this is manifested in agricul-ture and in industry. 
 This feature springs from the general *“Let us see what the further development of capitalism could bring even if we succeeded in sinking Britain to the bottom of the sea and in taking her place” (Mr. 
 N. 
 —on, Sketches, 210). 
 The cotton industry of Britain and America, which meets q of the world’s demand, employs only a little over 600,000 people all told. 
 “And itfollows, that even if we got a considerable part of the world market... capitalism would still be unable to exploit the whole mass oflabouring people which it is now continuously depriving of employ-ment. 
 What, indeed, are some 600,000 British and American workers compared with millions of peasants left for months on end withoutemployment?” (211). 
 “History has gone on till now, but goes on no longer. 
” Till now every step in the development of capitalism in the textile industryhas been accompanied by the differentiation of the peasantry, by the growth of commercial agriculture and agricultural capitalism, by the diversion of population from agriculture to industry, by “mil-lions of peasants” turning to building, lumbering and all sorts ofother non-agricultural work for hire, by the migration of masses ofpeople to the outer regions and by the conversion of these regionsinto a market for capitalism. 
 All this, however, has only gone on laws of the realisation of the product in capitalist society, and fully conforms to the antagonistic nature of this society. 
 * The socialisation of labour by capitalism is manifested in the following processes. 
 Firstly, the very growth ofcommodity-production destroys the scattered condition ofsmall economic units that is characteristic of natural economyand draws together the small local markets into an enormousnational (and then world) market. 
 Production for oneself is transformed into production for the whole of society; and the greater the development of capitalism, the strongerbecomes the contradiction between this collective characterof production and the individual character of appro-priation. 
 Secondly, capitalism replaces the former scatteredproduction by an unprecedented concentration both in agriculture and in industry. 
 That is the most striking and outstanding, but not the only, manifestation of the feature ofcapitalism under review. 
 Thirdly, capitalism eliminates theforms of personal dependence that constituted an inalienablecomponent of preceding systems of economy. 
 In Russia, theprogressive character of capitalism in this respect is particularly marked, since the personal dependence of the producer existed in our country (and partly continues to existto this day), not only in agriculture, but in manufactur-ing industry (“factories” employing serf labour), in themining and metallurgical industries, in the fishing industry, *His ignoring of the significance of the means of production and his careless attitude to “statistics” have led to the following utterly untenable statement by Mr. 
 N. 
 —on: “... all (!) capitalist production in the sphere of manufacturing industry at most producesnew values to the amount of not more than 400 to 500 million rubles” ( Sketches , 328). 
 Mr. 
 N. 
 —on bases this calculation on the returns of the three-per-cent tax and the extra profits tax, without stopping tothink whether such returns can cover “all capitalist production in the sphere of manufacturing industry. 
” Moreover, he takes returns which (on his own admission) do not cover the mining and metallur-gical industries, and yet he includes in “new values” only surplus-value and variable capital. 
 Our theoretician has forgotten that, in those branches of industry which produce goods for personal consumption,constant capital also represents new value for society and is exchanged for the variable capital and surplus-value of those branches of industry which produce means of production (mining and metallurgicalindustries, building, lumbering, railway construction, etc. 
). 
 Had Mr. 
 N. 
 —on not confused the number of “factory” workers with the total number of workers capitalistically employed in manufacturing ind-etc. 
* Compared with the labour of the dependent or bonded peasant, the labour of the hired worker is progressive in all branches of the national economy. 
 Fourthly, capitalism necessarily creates mobility of the population, something notrequired by previous systems of social economy and impos-sible under them on anything like a large scale. 
 Fifthly,capitalism constantly reduces the proportion of the popula-tion engaged in agriculture (where the most backward forms of social and economic relationships always prevail), and increases the number of large industrial centres. 
 Sixthly,capitalist society increases the population’s need forassociation, for organisation, and lends these organisationsa character distinct from those of former times. 
 While break-ing down the narrow, local, social-estate associations of medieval society and creating fierce competition, capital-ism at the same time splits the whole of society into largegroups of persons occupying different positions in produc-tion, and gives a tremendous impetus to organisation withineach such group. 
 ** Seventhly, all the above-mentioned changes effected in the old economic system by capitalism inevitably lead also to a change in the mentality of the population. 
 The spasmodic character of economic develop-ment, the rapid transformation of the methods of productionand the enormous concentration of production, the disappear-ance of all forms of personal dependence and patriarchalism in relationships, the mobility of the population, the influence of the big industrial centres, etc. 
—all this cannot but leadto a profound change in the very character of the producers, *For example, in one of the principal centres of the Russian fishing industry, the Murmansk coast, the “age-old” and truly “time-hallowed” form of economic relationships was the “pokrut, ” which was already fully established in the 17th century and continuedalmost without change until recent times. 
 “The relations between thepokrutmen and their masters are not limited to the time spent at the fisheries: on the contrary, they embrace the whole life of the pokrut-men, who are permanently dependent economically on their masters”(Material on Artels in Russia , Vol. 
 II, St. 
 Petersburg, 1874, p. 
 33). 
 Fortunately, in this branch of industry also, capitalism is apparentlymarked by a “contemptuous attitude to its own historical past. 
”“Monopoly ... is giving way to ... the capitalist organisation of the industry with hired labourers” ( Productive Forces , V, pp. 
 2-4). 
 **Cf. 
 Studies , p. 
 91, footnote 85, p. 
 198. 
 (See present edition,167 and we have had occasion to note the corresponding obser-vations of Russian investigators. 
 Turning now to Narodnik economics, with whose repre-sentatives we have constantly had to polemise, we may sumup the causes of our differences with them as follows. 
 First,we cannot but regard as absolutely wrong the Narodniks’very conception of the process of capitalist developmentin Russia, and their notion of the system of economic rela-tionships that preceded capitalism in Russia; and what is particularly important, from our point of view, is theirignoring of the capitalist contradictions in the structure ofpeasant economy (both agricultural and industrial). 
 Fur-thermore, whether the development of capitalism in Russiais slow or rapid, depends entirely on what we compare this development with. 
 If we compare the pre-capitalist epoch in Russia with the capitalist (and that is the comparison whichis needed for arriving at a correct solution of the problem),the development of social economy under capitalism mustbe considered as extremely rapid. 
 If, however, we comparethe present rapidity of development with that which could be achieved with the general level of technique and culture as it is today, the present rate of development of capitalismin Russia really must be considered as slow. 
 And it cannot butbe slow, for in no single capitalist country has there been suchan abundant survival of ancient institutions that are incom-patible with capitalism, retard its development, and immeas-urably worsen the condition of the producers, who “suffer not only from the development of capitalist production, butalso from the incompleteness of that development. 
 168 Finally, perhaps the profoundest cause of disagreement with theNarodniks is the difference in our fundamental views onsocial and economic processes. 
 When studying the latter, the Narodnik usually draws conclusions that point to some moral; he does not regard the diverse groups of persons takingpart in production as creators of various forms of life; hedoes not set out to present the sum-total of social and econom-ic relationships as the result of the mutual relations betweenthese groups, which have different interests and different historical roles.

 If the writer of these lines has succeeded in providing some material for clarifying these problems,he may regard his labours as not having been fruitless.

 of industryTotal Total Total and we have had occasion to note the corresponding obser-vations of Russian investigators. 
 Turning now to Narodnik economics, with whose repre-sentatives we have constantly had to polemise, we may sumup the causes of our differences with them as follows. 
 First,we cannot but regard as absolutely wrong the Narodniks’very conception of the process of capitalist developmentin Russia, and their notion of the system of economic rela-tionships that preceded capitalism in Russia; and what is particularly important, from our point of view, is theirignoring of the capitalist contradictions in the structure ofpeasant economy (both agricultural and industrial). 
 Fur-thermore, whether the development of capitalism in Russiais slow or rapid, depends entirely on what we compare this development with. 
 If we compare the pre-capitalist epoch in Russia with the capitalist (and that is the comparison whichis needed for arriving at a correct solution of the problem),the development of social economy under capitalism mustbe considered as extremely rapid. 
 If, however, we comparethe present rapidity of development with that which could be achieved with the general level of technique and culture as it is today, the present rate of development of capitalismin Russia really must be considered as slow. 
 And it cannot butbe slow, for in no single capitalist country has there been suchan abundant survival of ancient institutions that are incom-patible with capitalism, retard its development, and immeas-urably worsen the condition of the producers, who “suffer not only from the development of capitalist production, butalso from the incompleteness of that development. 
 168 Finally, perhaps the profoundest cause of disagreement with theNarodniks is the difference in our fundamental views onsocial and economic processes. 
 When studying the latter, the Narodnik usually draws conclusions that point to some moral; he does not regard the diverse groups of persons takingpart in production as creators of various forms of life; hedoes not set out to present the sum-total of social and econom-ic relationships as the result of the mutual relations betweenthese groups, which have different interests and different historical roles.

 determine the latter, another approximate calculation hadto be made. 
 Knowing the division of families according to thenumber of family workers (and separately—according to thenumber of wage-workers employed), we assumed that thelower the income of a family, the smaller its size (i. 
e. 
,the smaller the number of family workers per establish-ment) and the fewer the establishments employing wage-workers. 
 On the contrary, the higher the income per family,the larger the number of establishments employing wage-workers and the larger the family, that is, the number offamily workers per establishment is larger. 
 Obviously, thisassumption is the most favourable for anyone who might want to contest our conclusions. 
 In other words, whatever other assumption was made, it would only help to rein-force our conclusions. 
 We now give a summary showing the division of the hand-icraftsmen according to the income of their establish-ments.

 P. 
 SKVORTSOV ’S ARTICLE “COMMODITY FETISHISM ” IN NAUCHNOYE OBOZRENIYE , No. 
 12, 1899. 
 ) Written in January-March, 1900 Published according Published in May and June, 1900 to the text of in the magazine Nauchnoye Obozreniye , Nauchnoye Obozreniye Nos. 
 5 and 6 169 Signed: Vladimir Ilyin “Jove is wrathful” . 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 This has long been known as a very amusing sort of spectacle, and actually the anger of the stern Thunderer merely calls forth laughter. 
 Further con-firmation of this old truth has been supplied by Mr. 
 P. 
 Skvor-tsov, who has let loose a host of the choicest “wrathful”remarks against my book on the process of the formation ofa home market for Russian capitalism. 
 I “To depict the process as a whole,” Mr. 
 Skvortsov grandly instructs me, “one must set forth one’s understanding ofthe capitalist mode of production; to confine oneself to mere references to the theory of realisation is quite super-fluous. 
” Why references to the theory of the home marketare “superfluous” in a book devoted to an analysis of dataon the home market, remains the secret of our stern Jove,who by “setting forth one’s understanding,” “understands” . 
 . 
 . 
giving extracts from Capital , half of which are irrelevant. 
 “The author may be reproached for the dialectical (a speci-men of Mr. 
 Skvortsov’s wit!) “contradiction that, havingset himself the aim of examining a problem” (of how thehome market is being formed for Russian capitalism), “hecomes, at the end of his references to theory , to the conclusion that no such problem exists at all. 
” Mr. 
 Skvortsov is so pleased with this remark of his that he repeats it several times, not seeing, or not wishing to see, that it is based ona gross error. 
 At the end of the first chapter of my book I say that “the problem of the home market as a separate , self-sufficient problem not depending on that of the degree of capitalist development does not exist at all” (69). 
170 Well, does the critic disagree with that? No, he agrees with it, foron the preceding page he says that my remarks are “fair. 
”That being the case, what has occasioned his clamour andattempt to divest my conclusion of its most important part?That also remains a secret. 
 At the end of the introduc-tory, theoretical chapter, I definitely indicate the theme of interest to me: “the question of how a home market isbeing formed for Russian capitalism reduces itself to thefollowing: How and in what direction are the diverse aspectsof the Russian national economy developing? What con-stitutes the connection between and interdependence of these diverse aspects?” (69). 
 Does the critic consider these questions unworthy of examination? No, he prefers to avoidthe issue of the theme I set myself and to point to other themes with which, at Jove’s behest, I should have occupied myself. 
 I should, in his opinion, have “described the repro-duction and circulation both of that part of the product which is produced in agriculture and in industry capitalistically, and of that part which is produced by independent peasantproducers . 
 . 
 . 
 and shown the relation between them, i. 
e. 
,the magnitudes of constant and variable capital and ofsurplus-value in each of the indicated departments of sociallabour” (2278). 
 Now that is simply a high-sounding and totally meaningless phrase! Before attempting to describe the reproduction and circulation of the product whichis produced in agriculture capitalistically, one must firstascertain exactly how and to what extent agriculture becomes capitalist, among peasants or among landlords, in one districtor in another, etc. 
 Unless this is done (and that is what I have done in my book), the description suggested by Mr. 
 Skvortsov will remain a series of commonplaces. 
 Beforewe can speak of the part of the product which is producedin industry capitalistically, we must first ascertain exactlywhich industry in Russia is becoming capitalist and to whatextent it is doing so. 
 That is precisely what I tried to do by processing the data on the handicraft industry, for example; our stern critic grandly passes all this by in silence andwith a supremely serious air invites me to mark time and to dispose of the matter with empty commonplaces about cap-italist industry! The question as to exactly which peasants in Russia are “independent producers” also requires a study of the facts, and that is what I tried to undertake in my book;had Mr. 
 Skvortsov pondered over this question, he would nothave made the nonsensical assertion that the categories ofconstant capital, variable capital and surplus-value may,without further ado, be applied to the economy of “inde-pendent peasant producers. 
” In a word, the elaboration of the theme proposed by Mr. 
 Skvortsov is possible only after clearing up the questions I have indicated. 
 Under the guiseof amending my formulation of the problem, our sterncritic beats a retreat from an analysis of concrete andhistorically specific reality to simply copying Marx. 
 Incidentally, we cannot pass by in silence the following trick by Mr. 
 P. 
 Skvortsov, one that splendidly characterisesour critic’s methods. 
 Prof. 
 Sombart (says Mr. 
 P. 
 Skvortsov)shows that German exports lag behind the development ofGerman industry. 
 “These data,” Mr. 
 P. 
 Skvortsov explains,“go to confirm my conception of markets. 
” Good, isn’t it? Mr. 
 Skvortsov’s arguments illustrate the meaning of the well-known saying: there’s a bush in the garden, and myuncle’s in Kiev. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 We are discussing the theory of reali-sation, and he tells us: capitalism, like feudalism, lives onsurplus-labour! If we add to such inimitable tricks a numberof stern rebukes, we shall get the sum-total of Mr. 
 Skvor-tsov’s “criticism. 
” But let the reader judge for himself: to show my “failure to understand,” Mr. 
 P. 
 Skvortsov cites, on pages 2279 and2280, extracts from various parts of the first chapter, picksout isolated words from isolated sentences and exclaims:“The finding , the exchange , the theory of the home market , the finding of the replacing , and finally, the compensating ! I do not think such precision of terms can be taken as evidencethat Mr. 
 Ilyin clearly understands Marx’s ‘remarkable’theory of realisation!?” Now that is precisely the sort of “criti-cism” that was once ridiculed by Chernyshevsky; a man takesup The Adventures of Chichikov and begins to “criticise”: “Chi-chi-kov, tchi-tchi. 
 . 
 . 
 Oh how funny! The finding, the exchange. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 I do not think that is clear. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
” 171 Oh, what destructive criticism! On page 52 of my book I say that it was not necessary to divide the product according to its natural form in analysing the production of individual capital, but that it was abso-lutely necessary in analysing the reproduction of socialcapital, for in the latter case (and only in the latter case)are we dealing with the replacement of the natural form ofthe product. 
 Mr. 
 Skvortsov asserts that I “failed to under-stand” Marx, severely reprimands me for “translating freely,” considers it “necessary to quote Capital at length” (the passages quoted stating exactly what I said), and pouncesupon the following words of mine: “Now, however, the ques-tion,” i. 
e. 
, in analysing the reproduction of social, and notof individual, capital, “is: where will the workers and thecapitalists obtain their articles of consumption, where will the capitalists obtain their means of production, how will the finished product meet all these demands and enableproduction to expand?” Underlining this passage, Mr. 
Skvortsov goes on to say: “The passages I have underlineddo indeed contain a theory of realisation, only not Marx’s,but Mr. 
 Ilyin’s, a theory which has nothing in common with Marx’s theory” (2282). 
 Strongly put! But let us see what sort of proof is advanced. 
 The proofs, of course, are quotationsfrom Marx, including the following: “The question as itimmediately forelies (sic!) * is this: How is the capital *By the way, about translations. 
 Quoting from my book the following passage: “... as though only the absolute consuming power of society constituted their (the productive forces’) outer limit ” (57), Mr. 
 Skvortsov gives me the following strict admonition: “Mr. 
 Ilyin ... did not notice the clumsiness of his translation, whereas the origi-nal says simply and clearly. 
 ‘als ob nur die absolute Konsumptions-fähigkeit der Gesellschaft ihre Grenze bilde’” (2286). 
 What is wrongwith this (quite correct) translation the critic does not indicate. 
 Butto show how strict he is, it will be sufficient to quote a couple of his translations. 
 Page 2284: “But when the normal annual reproduction is shown on a given scale ... thereby it is also shown ...” (in the original: ist damit auch unterstellt); page 2285: “We are dealing,primarily, with simple reproduction. 
 Further on it will be shown ” (in the original: Ferner wird unterstellt) not only that products are exchanged at their value,” etc. 
 Thus, good Mr. 
 Skvortsov is no doubtfirmly convinced that “unterstellen” means “to show,” and that “wird interstellt” is future tense. 
 I say nothing about the style of our stern critic, who treats us to such phrases as: “now the capitalist mode of production equals agri-cullural industry” (2293). 
 consumed in production replaced in value out of the annual product, and how is the movement of this replacement in-tertwined with the consumption of surplus-value by the cap-italists, and of wages by the workers?” Conclusion: “I be-lieve that I have shown sufficiently that the theory of real-isation which Mr. 
 Ilyin presents as Marx’s has nothing incommon with the analysis given by Marx,” etc. 
 All I can dois to ask once again: Good, isn’t it? What the difference is between what I say and what is said in the quotations from Marx remains the secret of our stern critic. 
 All that is clear isthat my mortal sin lies in “translating freely,” or perhaps inthat I explain Marx in my “own words,” as Mr. 
 Skvortsovexpresses it in another part of his article (2287). 
 Just thinkof it! To expound Marx in one’s “own words”! “Genuine” Marxism consists in learning Capital by heart and quoting passages from it, in season and out . 
 . 
 . 
 à la Mr. 
 Nikolai —on. 
 Here is an illustration confirming this last remark. 
 In my book I say that capitalism “makes its appearance only as aresult of widely developed commodity circulation,” and, inanother place, that “capitalism is that stage in the develop-ment of commodity-production in which labour-power, too, becomes a commodity. 
” Midst thunder and lightning ourstern Jove announces: “under what conditions capitalismmakes its appearance . 
 . 
 . 
 is known to every more or less educated reader” (sic!), “Mr. 
 Ilyin’s bourgeois horizon,” andother pearls adorning the polemics of the wrathful Mr. 
 Skvor-tsov. 
 Then follow quotations from Marx: the first says exactly what I said (the purchase and sale of labour-power is the basic condition of capitalist production); the second says that the mode of circulation derives from the social charac-ter of production and not vice versa ( Das Kapital , II. 
 B. 
, 93). 
 172 Mr. 
 Skvortsov imagines he has utterly confuted his opponent with this last quotation. 
 Actually, however, he has replaced the question I raised by another one and given proof of his ability to offer irrelevant quotations. 
 What did I speak of in the incriminating passage? Of the fact that capitalism is the result of commodity circulation, i. 
e. 
, of the historical relation between capitalist production and commodity circulation. 
 And what is spoken of in the passage quoted from Volume II of Capital (the volume devoted to the circulation of capital)? The relation between capitalist production and capitalist circulation; Marx is polemising in this passage (S. 
 92. 
 II. 
 B. 
)173 against the economists who contrasted natural economy, money economy and credit economy as three characteristic economic forms of movementin social production; Marx says that that is wrong, becausemoney and credit economy are merely modes of circulationpeculiar to different stages in the development of capitalistproduction, and he concludes with a remark about the “bour-geois horizon” of these economists . 
 Mr Skvortsov thinks that “genuine” Marxism consists in clutching at the last word ofMarx and repeating it, even against an opponent who didnot dream of discussing the relation between natural, moneyand credit economy. 
 We leave it to the reader to determinewhich party displays “failure to understand,” and among what sort of literature such tricks are classified. 
 Behind the clamour of his stern rebukes Mr. 
 Skvortsov not only resortedto the “point of replacing” but also completely evaded theproblem of the relation between capitalist production andcommodity circulation. 
 That is a very important problem, towhich I revert many times in my book, emphasising the historical role of merchant’s capital as the predecessor of capitalist production. 
 Mr. 
 Skvortsov would seem to have noobjection to this (judging by the fact that he says nothingabout it). 
 That being the case, what sense is there in thenoise he makes about my statement that capitalism is aresult of commodity circulation? Does not merchant’s capi-tal express the development of commerce, i. 
e. 
, commodity circulation without capitalist production? These questionstoo, once again, remain the secret of the wrathful Jove. 
 To finish with the “criticism” Mr. 
 Skvortsov directs against the theoretical part of my book, I have to examine a fewmore of the stern rebukes and gross errors which abound in the article “Commodity Fetishism. 
” In my book I say: “The need for a capitalist country to have a foreign market is . 
 . 
 . 
 determined . 
 . 
 . 
 by the fact thatcapitalism makes its appearance only as a result of widelydeveloped commodity circulation , which transcends the limits of the state. 
 It is therefore impossible to conceive a capitalist nation without foreign trade, nor is there any such nation. 
 As the reader sees, this reason is of a historicalorder” (65). 
 The stern Jove “criticises”: “I, as a reader, do not see that this reason is of a historical order. 
 A totally un-founded assertion” (2284), etc. 
 If commodity circulation is the necessary historical predecessor of capitalism, is there any need to explain in addition why “this reason is of a his-torical order”? For the abstract theory of capitalism all that exists is developed and fully established capitalism, and the ques-tion of its origin is eliminated. 
 “Mr. 
 Ilyin . 
 . 
 . 
 for the realisation of the product in capital-ist society . 
 . 
 . 
 turns to the aid of the foreign market” (2286). 
To the reader who is familiar with my Studies and The Development of Capitalism in Russia I need scarcely explain that this, too, is a trick performed by the same method asthe preceding ones. 
 A quotation from Marx: “. 
 . 
 . 
 foreign com-merce only replaces home products by articles of other use or bodily form. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
” 174 Conclusion: “Every literate person, with the exception of critically-minded individuals, willunderstand that Marx says the very opposite of Mr. 
 Ilyin’stheory that there is no need to go to the foreign market tofind ‘an equivalent for that part of the product which is being sold,’ to find ‘another part of the capitalist product that can replace the first”’ (2284). 
 Oh, splendid Mr. 
 Skvor-tsov! “Mr. 
 Ilyin . 
 . 
 . 
 by ignoring the essential features of capitalist society and thus converting it into planned pro-duction—proportion in the development of different trades undoubtedly means planned production—nicely realises, in the end, the same quantity of products within thecountry” (2286). 
 Our “critic’s” new trick consists in attribut-ing to me the notion that capitalism ensures regularproportion. 
 Constant, deliberately maintained proportionwould, indeed, signify the existence of planning; but this is not the proportion which is “established only as the average magnitude of a number of continual fluctuations”(that is what I say in the passage quoted by Mr. 
 Skvortsov). 
I definitely say that proportion (or conformity) is“assumed ” by theory, but in fact it is “ constantly disturbed ,” that to replace one distribution of capital by another and so create proportion “ there must be a crisis ” (all the words underlined are to be found on that very page 66, which isquoted by Mr. 
 Skvortsov). 
 The question arises, what can one think of a critic who ascribes to his opponent the transforma-tion of capitalism into planned production, while making reference to the very page and the very paragraph where that opponent says that for capitalism there must be a crisis so as to create a constantly disturbed proportion?? II Let us pass to the second part of Mr. 
 Skvortsov’s article, which is devoted to a criticism of the factual data quoted and analysed in my book. 
 Maybe here, at least, we shall find some serious criticism relating to problems of which a special study has been made by Mr. 
 Skvortsov. 
 The social division of labour is the basis of commodity economy and is the basic process of the formation of a home market—says Mr. 
 Skvortsov, quoting my words—”while plain ‘division of labour’—not social, we must assume— is the basis of manufacture. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
” In this “attempt at irony” the critic reveals his failure to understand the elementary difference between division of labour in society and divi-sion of labour in the workshop: the former creates (undercommodity production—a condition which I definitely specified, so that Mr. 
 Skvortsov’s reminder about the divi-sion of labour in the Indian village community relates to that author’s deplorable weakness for quoting irrelevant passages from Marx) isolated commodity-producers, who, independently and separately from one another, produce different products which enter into exchange; the latter does not alter the relation of the producers to society, but merely transforms their position in the workshop. 
 That is the reason, so far as I can judge, why Marx sometimes speaks of “social division of labour” * and at others simply *In chapter twelve, volume one of Capital [in the English edi-tion it is Chapter XIV. 
— Ed. 
], which deals with manufacture, there is a special section entitled “Division of Labour in Manufacture, andDivision of Labour in Society. 
” At the beginning of this section Marxsays: “We shall now lightly touch upon the relation between thedivision of labour in manufacture, and the social division of labour,which forms the foundation of all production of commodities” ( Das Kapital , I 2, S. 
 362). 
175 How truly instructive it is to contrast this to the trick of our wrathful Jove! of division of labour. 
 If Mr. 
 Skvortsov thinks otherwise, he should formulate and explain his opinion instead of dealing out stern but wholly meaningless remarks. 
 “Division of labour is not in the least a characteristic feature of manufacture, for division of labour exists in the factory too. 
” Very well, Mr. 
 Skvortsov! But have I said that this is the only feature that distingulshes manufacture from the factory? Had the critic at all seriously wanted to discover whether I correctly understand the “characteristic features of manufacture” (a very interesting and by no means as simple a problem as may appear at first sight), could he have kept silent about the fact that in the very section concerned I definitely say: “We have had occasion elsewhere to enu-merate the principal features of the concept of manufacture according to Marx ( Studies , 179 *)” (385, footnote 1)? In the Studies , division of labour figures as only one of a series of features. 
 The reader of Mr. 
 Skvortsov’s article might, therefore, get an absolutely distorted notion of my views, and no notion whatever of the critic’s views. 
 To proceed. 
 The attempt to present a whole number of so-called “handicraft” industries as the manufactory stage of Russian capitalism is made in my book, if I am not mistaken, for the first time , and I, of course, am far from imagining that this problem has been altogether settled (particularly since I have examined it from a specific point of view). 
 I accordingly anticipated criticism of my views, and did so with all the more reason, and all the more interest, because certain Russian Marxists had expressed somewhat different views (see The Development of Capitalism , p. 
 550, footnote). 
 But how has the problem been treated by Mr. 
 P. 
 Skvortsov? His “criticism” amounts in its entirety to an exhortation, magnificent for its laconic severity, not to confine myself to a “mechanical enumeration of the number of wage-workers, of aggregate output in such and such years in this or that sphere of production” (2278). 
 If this exhortation does not refer to the section of my book which deals with the question of factory statistics (Mr. 
 Skvortsov *See present edition, Vol. 
 2, The Handicraft Census of 1894-95 in Perm Gubernia . 
—Ed. 
 does not say a word about this), it must refer to the chapter on manufacture, the greater part of which consists of fac-tual data. 
 How they might have been dispensed with is a secret that our stern critic does not reveal, and I continue tohold to the opinion that it is better to incur the charge ofmy exposition being dry than to give the reader cause tothink that my opinion is based on “quotations” from Cap-ital, and not on a study of Russian data. 
 If Mr. 
 Skvortsov thinks my enumeration is “mechanical,” are we to take it that he considers as wrong the conclusions which I have drawnfrom these data in the second half of Chapter VI, andrepeated in Chapter VII, §XII?—Are we to take it that he doesnot agree that these data show a specific structure of industrycharacterised by aspecific system of: 1) technique, 2) economy and 3) culture? The stern Jove had not a single word to say about this in his “criticism,” which, if we discount the wrath-ful rebukes, is left without any content whatsoever. 
 That’srather little, most respected Mr. 
 Skvortsov! Let us pass to the part played by peasant taxes in devel-oping commodity economy. 
 I asserted that at one time poll-taxes had been an important factor in the development of exchange, but that now commodity-production hadbecome so firmly established that the importance of taxes“is becoming altogether secondary. 
” Against this Mr. 
 Skvor-tsov launches a host of paltry and fearful words such as,“fetishism of commodities,” unite everything, “omnipo-tence,” potency of commodity-production, etc. 
; but alas, these potent words merely cover up the stern critic’s impotenceto refute the conclusion I drew. 
 “Even Mr. 
 Kautsky,”writes Mr. 
 Skvortsov, “to whom Mr. 
 Ilyin bears resemblancein many respects” . 
 . 
 . 
 (poor “Mr. 
 Kautsky,” who “bearsresemblance” to the “commodity fetishist,” completely fails to understand Capital , and resembles that man who is weighed down by a “bourgeois horizon,” Mr. 
 Ilyin! Will herecover from the blow struck by a “genuine” Marxist?) . 
 . 
 . 
“says that the conversion of peasant dues in kind into duesin cash increases the peasants’ demand for money” (2288). 
Very well, stern Mr. 
 Critic, but surely that has absolutely nothing to do with the problem of the part played by taxes in the peasants ’ cash expenditure as compared with outlays on the rest of their needs and requirements. 
 This problem is not even touched upon by Kautsky. 
 Mr. 
 Skvortsov over and over again reveals his remarkable talent for offering irrele-vant quotations. 
 “The main question,” says Mr. 
 Skvortsov, advancing his second objection, “which is not explained evenby the budget data, is as follows: where is the horselesspeasant to obtain 25 rubles to pay his taxes” (25 per cent o f his cash espenditure, 25 rubles out of 100 rubles has beenturned by Mr. 
 Skvortsov simply into 25 rubles!) “and the horse-owning peasant 10 rubles? The question is not what part of the income (?) taxes constitute in the peasants’total cash expenditure” (2290). 
 I advise Mr. 
 Skvortsov to takeout a patent for a remarkable invention: the very latestand very easiest method of “scientific criticism” that radi-cally destroys an opponent. 
 On one out of several hundred pages of his book your opponent incidentally raises the ques-tion of the share of tax expenditure in the total cash expend-iture; all you have to do is to quote this passage, foistanother question on your opponent, and you brilliantly prove that he is a “commodity fetishist,” who, monster thathe is, does not give a thought to where the poor horseless peasant is to get 25 rubles! And then, as to other pages in the book, which deal with the ratio of taxes to income,with the items and with the source of income, you canomit them and thus prove that your opponent has a “bour-geois horizon. 
” Really, take out a patent, Mr. 
 Skvortsov! Here is another example of how Mr. 
 Skvortsov utilises his invention. 
 I ask the reader’s attention: such gems of“scientific criticism” are the only ones of their kind. 
 We refer to the same page 156, which deals with the budget figures for peasant taxes. 
 After showing the roleof taxes in the peasants’ total cash expenditure, I con-tinue: “If, however, we do not take the role of taxes in the development of exchange, but take them relative to income, we shall see that it is an excessively high one. 
 Howheavily the traditions of the pre-Reform epoch weighdown upon the peasant of today is seen most strikingly inthe existence of taxes which absorb one-seventh of the gross expenditure of the small farmer, or even of the allotment-holding farm labourer. 
 Moreover, the distribution of taxes within the village community is astonishingly uneven: thebetter off the peasant, the smaller the part of his total expenditure that goes in taxes. 
 The horseless peasant pays in proportion to his income nearly three times as much as the peasant owning many horses (see above, table on distribu-tion of expenditure).

” Any reader who is at all attentivein his approach to what he reads must naturally ask: Whydo I speak of the distribution of taxes within the village com-munity, when the budgets relate to the farms of peasants notonly of different communities, but even of different uyezds? Perhaps the uneven distribution is here fortuitous—perhaps it depends on the different assessment of one dessiatineof allotment land in the different uyezds or in the differentvillage communities from which the farms were takenfor compiling the typical budgets? And so, in order toeliminate this inevitable objection, I immediately went on, after what I had said, to explain: “. 
 . 
 . 
 We speak of the distri-bution of taxes within the village community , because if we calculate the amount of taxes and duties per dessiatine ofallotment land , it will be found to be nearly uniform . 
 . 
 . 
 . 
” Had the critic wanted to verify these words, all he needed to dowas to compare the table on page 151 (amount of taxes and dues per farm) with the table on p. 
 157 (quantity of allotment land per household) to convince himself with ease that,judging by the budget data, although the budgeted farmsbelong to different communities, and even to different uyezds,the amounts of taxes and dues per dessiatine of allotmentland are nearly uniform. 
 And now, observe what methods Mr. 
 Critic uses to destroy his opponent! He picks out the words I underlinedabout the amount of taxes per dessiatine of allotment land;fails to notice (sic!) that these words relate only to the budget data ; ascribes to these words the meaning that the amount of taxes per dessiatine of allotment land is nearly uniform for the whole of the Russian peasantry; triumph-antly accuses me, because of this latter conclusion, of notbeing acquainted with Zemstvo statistical publications, andcites two tables to confirm the (generally known) fact thatin different village communities, volosts and uyezds, theamounts of taxes per dessiatine of allotment land are far from being uniform. 
 Having performed this trick, the critic goes on to add: “Indeed, within a village communitywhere one and the same size of allotment is received, the payments will be not nearly but actually uniform in size. 
 The whole point is that Mr. 
 Ilyin does not know which village community he is talking about. 
 To finish with Mr. 
 Ilyin’s abuse of the Zemstvo statistics,” etc. 
 . 
 . 
 (2292). 
 Iwould like very much to know whether another examplecould be found in scientific literature of this sort of criticism. 
 Having acquainted ourselves with the methods by which Mr. 
 Skvortsov “has proved” the utter “worthlessness” of the budget data I have given, we may presumably ignore the potent (and impotent) terms in which the critic expresseshis dissatisfaction with the very use of budget data. 
 Indemanding mass data on budgets, Mr. 
 Skvortsov is evi-dently talking again about something that has nothing to dowith the case, for descriptions of specific farms, such as I made use of, never are and never can be of a mass nature. 
 The literature relating to the budgets of specific farms isindicated by me at the beginning of the section criticised,and I would, of course, only be grateful to the critic if hesupplemented or corrected me. 
 But Mr. 
 Skvortsov knowshow to “criticise” without touching on the substance of the point at issue! I attempted to prove that the budgets were typical by comparing the average sizes of family, crop area,land rented and number of animals per horseless and one-horse households, according to the budget data and the“mass data” (p. 
 158 of my book); but our stern critic simplycalls this a “curiosity”—on what grounds, nobody knows. 
 Per-haps for the same reason that a certain “critic” found the name Chichikov so funny? The budgets “are not typical . 
 . 
 . 
 if onlybecause the disposal of . 
 . 
 . 
 grain . 
 . 
 . 
 from the autumnonwards and its acquisition in the spring are very rarely metwith in Voronezh Gubernia, whereas for the whole of Rus-sia” such disposal has been proved to be the case, supposedly, by Mr. 
 Nik. 
 —on (2291). 
 It is a true proverb which says that les beaux esprits se rencontrent *: That “genuine” Marxist, Mr. 
 Pavel Skvortsov, coming up against a contradictionbetween the assertions of the “genuine” Marxist, Mr. 
 Nikolai—on, and Zemstvo statistical data, unhesitatingly settlesthe problem along the lines that the data are not typical, and not that Mr. 
 Nik. 
 —on’s statements are wrong, or too *All great minds think alike. 
— Ed. 
 general. 
 Besides, what has the question of selling grain in autumn and buying grain in spring to do with the controversy over whether or not certain budgets are typical, budgets which, in examining the problem, I do not use at all? III After the thankless job of explaining the things imputed to me, it is a pleasure to meet, at last, with an objection on fundamentals, even if formulated in terms of the sternrebukes (“fetishism,” “utter failure to understand”) which Mr. 
Skvortsov evidently considers very convincing, and even ifthe critic’s own opinions have had to be surmised rather thanseen plainly stated. 
 Mr. 
 Skvortsov is quite right when he says that my views “are the central theme of the entire book. 
” In order to set off our points of disagreement more sharply, I will compare two extreme formulations of our oppo-site views: Mr. 
 Skvortsov probably thinks (at all events, itfollows from his objections) that the less the land the peas-ants received when they were emancipated, and the higher the price they paid for it, the faster would have been the development of capitalism in Russia. 
 I think the opposite:the more the land the peasants received when they were eman-cipated , and the lower the price they paid for it , the faster , wider and freer would have been the development of capital-ism in Russia , the higher would have been the standard of living of the population, the wider would have been the home market, the faster would have been the introduction ofmachinery into production; the more, in a word, would theeconomic development of Russia have resembled that ofAmerica. 
 I shall confine myself to indicating two circumstanceswhich, in my opinion, confirm the correctness of the latter view: 1) land-poverty and the burden of taxation have led to the development over a very considerable area of Russiaof the labour-service system of private-landowner farming,i. 
e. 
, a direct survival of serfdom, * and not at all to the *Incidentally, in my book I definitely advance this thesis (that labour-service is a survival of serfdom). 
 Mr. 
 Skvortsov says nothing about this but takes my remark that, fundamentally, labour-service has existed ever since the time of Russkaya Pravda and storms about it; he cites a quotation from Klyuchevsky, talks of home marketsin the 12th century, and of commodity fetishism, and asserts that development of capitalism; 2) it is in our border regions, where serfdom was either entirely unknown, or was feeblest, and where the peasants suffer least from land shortage, labour-service and the burden of taxation, that there has beenthe greatest development of capitalism in agriculture. 
 Thiscomparison is necessary precisely for an analysis of the con-ditions of the “transition from the one social formation tothe other,” which I am so fiercely and so sweepingly accused of ignoring by Mr. 
 Skvortsov. 
 The extremely stereotyped nature of Mr. 
 Skvortsov’s views on the economic processes in peasant economy inthis country is also revealed by his remarks on migrationand on the way capitalism breaks down medieval barriers. 
Now, was I not right in drawing a comparison between Mr. 
 Pavel Skvortsov and Mr. 
 Nikolai —on? Both “solve” the problem of migration by an extremely simple and entirelynegative criticism of those “who attach importance” tomigration. 
 But that conclusion is worthy only of the mostprimitive—to wit, “genuine”—Marxism, which contentsitself with absolutely abstract . 
 . 
 . 
 commonplaces. 
 What does “attach importance” to migration mean? If we take these words in their literal sense, can there be a single economistof sound mind and good memory who does not attach impor-tance to the annual migrations? If we take these words in the specific sense of capitalism , then, firstly, Mr. 
 Skvortsov distorts my meaning, for I say the very opposite in the pas-sage he quotes. 
 Secondly, an economist who sets out to study the characteristics of the economic system anddevelopment of Russia (not only to bring lengthy, and oftenirrelevant, quotations from Marx) must necessarilyask: what influence is exerted by the migrations in Russia?Without making a special study of the question, I remarked in the passage indicated by Mr. 
 Skvortsov that my conclu-sions on the differentiation of the peasantry fully corre-spond to those of Mr. 
 Hourwich. 
* Moreover, I repeatedly I think that “commodity production is the miraculous and all-ex-plaining starting-point in history (sic!) since the days of Russkaya Pravda ” (sic!). 
 This, apparently, is some more of the “tchi-tchi” type of criticism to which, as it is, I think I devoted too much time at thebeginning of this article. 
 A propos of Mr. 
 Hourwich, Mr. 
 Skvortsov, by his unwarranted touch on the subject of migration in other parts of my book. 
 Maybe my views on this subject are wrong, but Mr. 
 Skvor-tsov does absolutely nothing to correct or to supplement them; he tota]ly obscures the issue with his stern rebukes. 
Further, my remarks give Mr. 
 Skvortsov grounds for con-cluding that the “commodity fetishist believes in the miracu-lous power of his fetish now” (sic!). 
 Now, that is truly “crush-ing”! But do you deny that I am right, most respected Mr. 
 Critic? Why not share your factual considerations with the public and examine the data of at least one uyezd? That would be so natural for a person who makes a special studyof Zemstvo statistics! And I take the liberty of holding thisview, in spite of Mr. 
 Skvortsov’s terrible words (fetishism,miraculous power), which—does anyone doubt it?—are enough to frighten anybody. 
* and supercilious attitude towards the “conclusions” of this writer who is known in Marxist literature as the author of two books and as a contributor to magazines, only reveals his own conceit. 
 *My words: “Before capitalism appeared, agriculture in Russia was the business of the gentry, a lord’s hobby for some, and a duty,an obligation for others” (313), in Mr. 
 Skvortsov’s opinion “indicatethat a whole social formation, the feudal mode of production, wasmerely a lord’s hobby. 
” No, Mr. 
 Skvortsov, they do not “indicate” this at all, for I pointed out elsewhere that “feudal economy was a definite, regular and complete system” (192), and here I merelydescribed one of the features of this system. 
 That landlord economy contained an element of the “lord’s hobby” can easily be seen by anyonewho remembers the “Oblomovs of the feudal or bondage-sufferingcountryside” (218); and it is borne out by the Zemstvo statisticians who invented the expression “lord’s hobby” (213),—it is proved even by the data on a certain period in the development of the agricultural-machinery industry in Russia: the attempts of landlords simply toimport both workers and machines from abroad (193), which (219)were nothing but a “lord’s hobby. 
”—“When and where the trans-formation by capitalism of the lord of the manor [votchinnik]” (Mr. 
 P. 
 S. 
 is wrong in thinking that this category is applicable only to the period “prior to the rise of serfdom”; it is also applicable to the periodof serfdom) “and of the dependent peasant into industrialists wascompleted Mr. 
 Ilyin does not, unfortunately, tell us. 
” (2293) I speakof this in chapters II and III, and particularly IV, of my book, whereI deal precisely with the transformation of agriculture into commer-cial and industrial enterprise. 
 Very possibly, what I say about this process requires supplementing and correcting, I have no doubt thatany serious and well-informed critic could do this; but Mr. 
 Skvortsov,unfortunately, has utterly obscured the issue by simply voicing sternrebukes. 
 That’s hardly enough! Finally, the last point on which one can discuss fundamen-tals with Mr. 
 Skvortsov is that of the classification of Zemstvo statistics on the peasantry. 
 Mr. 
 Skvortsov has made a special study of Zemstvo statistics, and, if we are notmistaken, still continues to do so. 
 One would, therefore, bejustified in expecting him to say something based on facts andexplaining this controversial and extremely interesting sub-ject. 
 I wrote: “we reject a limine any classification according to allotment and exclusively employ classification according to economic strength (draught animals, area under crops),”and I went on to say that classification accordingto allotment, which is far more common in our Zemstvostatistics, is absolutely unsuitable because life disturbsthe equality (within the village community) of allotment land tenure: it is sufficient to recall such universally known and unchallenged facts as the leasing of allotments, their abandonment, the purchase and the renting of land and the supplementing of agriculture with commercial and indus-trial enterprises and with work for hire. 
 “Economic statistics must necessarily take the scale and type of farm as the basis of classification” (105). 
 Mr. 
 Skvortsov’s “criticism” consists inthe following: “Mr. 
 Ilyin is displeased with the classifica-tion of statistics on the peasantry according to allotment. 
 There are two (sic!) classifications of statistics. 
 One is the historical classification, according to which village commu-nities (!) having the same amount of allotment land per registered person are gathered into one group. 
 The other is a factual classification, according to which peasant farms having allotments of equal size, regardless of the communi-ties to which they belong, are gathered into one group. 
 What makes the historical classification important is that it clearly shows what the conditions were under which the peasantry passed from feudal to capitalist society . 
 . 
 . 
” and so forth on this theme, also examined above. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 “The classification Mr. 
 llyin proposes . 
 . 
 . 
 utterly confuses the historical conception of the conditions of our peasantry’s transition from the one social formation to the other. 
 Mr. 
 Ilyin’s proposal is more in the nature of an industrial census (sic!), such as is taken in Germany” (2289). 
 This is a sample of Mr. 
 Skvortsov’s criticism on a subject on which he specialises, and on a question on which, with the best will in the world, it is impossible to “quote” Marx. 
 The question is: What is the point of this argument about the “historical” classification of village communities, when I am dealing with the classification of house-to-house data? By what miraculous means can the classification of present-day house-to-house data “utterly con-fuse” the long-established historical data on village communi-ties? Mr. 
 Skvortsov is entitled to use the word “historical” inthis connection only to the extent that he turns his back on history : if the classification of village communities accord-ing to size of allotment per registered person relates to thehistory of what happened 40 years ago, then what is going onbefore our eyes with ever-increasing rapidity is also history. 
Further, it is altogether inexplicable how a man who studiesZemstvo statistics and talks of all things in nothing less than the tone of a prophet can write that “there are two clas-sifications” (of village communities according to allotmentand of households according to allotment), when everyoneknows that there are very many classifications : according to area under crops, number of draught animals, number ofworking members, number of farm labourers, house owner-ship, and so forth? How can Mr. 
 Skvortsov declare so categorically, and without a shadow of proof , that only classification according to allotment is “factual,” when thepoint at issue is precisely: is this classification a factual one? I show for a number of uyezds that the distribution of allotment land among the peasant farms continues to this day to be marked by an “equality” that is relatively very great (20% of well-to-do households, 26-30% of the population,account for 29-36% of the allotment land in variousuyezds or groups of uyezds), whereas the distribution of thefactual indices of farming, draught animals, area under crops, improved implements, etc. 
, is everywhere, without exception, incomparably less equal. 
 Mr. 
 Skvortsov con-trives to criticise, and even berate, my statements, withoutsaying a word about fundamentals. 
 It goes without saying that, not being a professional statistician, I laid no claims to solving the problem of classi-fication. 
 I think, however, that the basic problems of Zem-stvo statistics (and the problem of the methods of classifying information concerning households is a basic one, as I pointout in the passage quoted by Mr. 
 Skvortsov) are things which not merely Zemstvo statisticians, but all economists, have a right and even a duty to discuss. 
 One cannot con-ceive of an economist who is studying the actual economic situation in Russia being able to dispense with Zemstvostatistics; and if the elaboration of Zemstvo statistics andthe work of economists proceed independently, each in itsown way, neither the one nor the other can achieve satisfac-tory results. 
 That classification according to allotment is not a satisfactory factual classification has been admitted in part by the Zemstvo statisticians themselves, who havegiven a number of classifications according to draughtanimals and to area under crops of which I made use inmy book. 
 Just now, when the importance of the problemis particularly emphasised by practically all Marxists and is not denied even by economists of other trends, a re-examination of the problem should be particularly nec-essary. 
 But Mr. 
 Skvortsov, instead of offering criticism,presents us with pompous but quite vapid phrases like thefollowing: “we need a summary of Zemstvo returns whichgives a detailed account of the production and reproduction of peasant farming, so that anyone who desires may take up such an abstract and verify the ‘conclusions’ of Messrs. 
Ilyin, Postnikov and Hourwich” (2292). 
 Yes, of course, “weneed a summary”; but if these words are not to remain anempty sound, and if the summary is really to succeedin answering the main problems advanced by Russia’s present economic system and by that system’s evolution, what is needed is to raise and to discuss from all angles thefundamental problem of the methods to be employed in draw-ing up the summary, to discuss it without fail in generalpublications, and not merely among Zemstvo statisticians,and still less within the four walls of this or that Zemstvo statistical bureau. 
 I raised this problem in my book and attempted to indicate its solution. 
 It is not, of course, forme to judge whether the solution is a correct one. 
 But I amjustified in drawing the conclusion that Mr. 
 Skvortsov,for all his sternness, has said nothing whatever about theproblem, but has instead, without grounds for so doing, advocated routine methods, advocated a point of view that was already old in 1885 (see footnote on page 103 of The Development of Capitalism , where I quote from Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
’s article “A New Type of Local Statistical Publication” his admission that “the statistical data must be adapted to the groups themselves and not to such a conglomeration ofthe most diverse economic groups of peasants as the vil-lage or the village community,” and where I raise the question as to why Mr. 
 V. 
 V. 
 himself never once made useof the data on these most diverse groups). 
 In conclusion, a few words about “orthodoxy,” which will not be superfluous, since Mr. 
 Skvortsov’s appearance in the role of “genuine” Marxist renders particularly urgent the precisest possible definition of what, if it may be soexpressed, is one’s position. 
 While not in the least desiring to place Mr. 
 B. 
 Avilov on a par with Mr. 
 Skvortsov, I never-theless find it necessary to touch on a passage in the former’sarticle in the same issue of the Nauchnoye Obozreniye . 
 At the end of a postscript to this article Mr. 
 B. 
 Avilov says: “Mr. 
 Ilyin stands also for orthodoxy. 
 But I think there isstill plenty of room for ‘orthodoxy,’ i. 
e. 
, the simple inter-pretation of Marx . 
 . 
 . 
” (p. 
 2308). 
 I think that the words I have italicised are probably a slip of the pen, for I said quitedefinitely that by orthodoxy I do not at all mean the simple interpretation of Marx . 
 In the article which Mr. 
 B. 
 Avilov has in mind, after the words: “No, let us better remain‘under the sign of orthodoxy,”’ I say: “Let us not believe that orthodoxy means taking things on trust, that orthodoxy precludes critical application and further development, thatit permits historical problems to be obscured by abstract schemes. 
 If there are orthodox disciples who are guilty of these truly grievous sins, the blame must rest entirely withthose disciples and not by any means with orthodoxy, which is distinguisbed by diametrically opposite qualities” ( Nauchnoye Obozreniye , 1899, No. 
 8, p. 
 1579). 
 176 Thus I definitely said that to accept anything on trust, to preclude critical appli-cation and development, is a grievous sin; and in order to apply and develop, “simple interpretation” is obviously notenough. 
 The disagreement between those Marxists who stand for the so-called “new critical trend” and those who stand for so-called “orthodoxy” is that they want to apply anddevelop Marxism in different directions : the one group want to remain consistent Marxists, developing the basic tenets of Marxism in accordance with the changing conditions and with the local characteristics of the different countries, and further elaborating the theory of dialectical materialism andthe political-economic teachings of Marx; the other group reject certain more or less important aspects of Marx’s teach-ings, and in philosophy, for instance, take the side, notof dialectical materialism, but of neo-Kantianism, and in political economy the side of those who label some of Marx’s teachings as “tendentious,” etc. 
 The former on this accountaccuse the latter of eclecticism, and in my opinion have very good grounds for doing so. 
 The latter call the former “ortho-dox,” and it should never be forgotten that use of this termhas been made by opponents in controversy, that the “orthodox” do not reject criticism in general, but only “criticism” by eclectics (who would only be entitled to callthemselves advocates of “criticism” to the extent that in the history of philosophy the teachings of Kant and of his follow-ers are called “criticism,” “critical philosophy”). 
 In thesame article I named authors (p. 
 1569, footnote, and p. 
 1570, footnote *) who, in my opinion, are representatives of the consistent and integral, and not eclectic, development ofMarxism, and who have done for this development—in the field of philosophy, in the field of political economy and in the field of history and politics—incomparably morethan, for example, Sombart or Stammler, ** the mere repeti-tion of whose eclectic views is regarded by many today as a big step forward. 
 It is scarcely necessary for me to add thatlatterly the representatives of the eclectic trend have grouped themselves around E. 
 Bernstein. 
 I shall limit myself to these brief remarks on the question of my “orthodoxy,” bothbecause it is not immediately relevant to the subject of my article, and because I am unable here to elaborate in detail the views of the former, and must refer those who are inter-ested to the German literature. 
 On this subject the Russian controversies are merely echoes of the German, and unless *See present edition, Vol. 
 4, Once More on the Theory of Realisation . 
—Ed. 
 **Cf. 
 against Stammler the very proper remarks made by G. 
 Cu-now, part of whose article was translated and published in the Nauch-noye Obozreniye in 1899; then B. 
 Lvov’s The Social Law (ibid. 
), and the translation of Mr. 
 Sadi Gunter’s article which the Nauchnoye Obozreniye promises to publish in 1900. 
 one is familiar with the latter one cannot obtain a really precise idea of the point at issue. 
 * *It is this eclecticism, in my opinion, which is the substance of the “new” “critical” trend that has “begun to take shape” in our literature latterly (cf. 
 Struve’s articles in Zhizn , 1899, No. 
 10, and 1900, No. 
 2, and Tugan-Baranovsky’s in Nauchnoye Obozreniye , 1899, No. 
 5, and 1900, No. 
 3). 
 The first-mentioned author began to “giveshape” to leanings towards eclecticism over five years ago in his Crit-ical Remarks , and immediately after that book appeared an attempt was made (as Struve will be good enough to recall) to “open the eyes” of the public to the mixture of Marxism and bourgeois science in hisviews. 
 177 It is strange, therefore, to hear the following from Struve: “Simply to close one’s eyes to the so-called (wrongly so-called, per-haps?—V. 
 I. 
) ‘bourgeois’ criticism of Marx’s teachings and to engagein repeating and paraphrasing them, has hitherto proved not only useless but even harmful” ( Zhizn , No. 
 2, 305). 
 “Simply to close one’s eyes,” not only to bourgeois science, but even to the most absurddoctrines, up to and including extreme obscurantism is, of courseundoubtedly harmful; that is a banal commonplace. 
 It is one thing,however, not to close one’s eyes to bourgeois science, by keepingwatch on it, and using it, but being critical towards it, and refusing to surrender the integrity and definiteness of one’s world outlook; but it is another thing to give way to bourgeois science and to repeat,for example, catchwords about Marx being “tendentious,” etc. 
, whichhave a very definite meaning and significance. 
 As for “repeating andparaphrasing,” does the repeating and paraphrasing of Bohm-Bawerkand Wieser, Sombart and Stammler, in itself, a priori, deserve more attention than the repeating and paraphrasing of Marx? Has Struve, who has managed to discern (in Russian literature, mind you) the“harmfulness” (sic!) of repeating Marx, failed to notice the harmful-ness of uncritically repeating the fashionable corrections of fashionablebourgeois “science”? How far must one have departed from Marxismto have arrived at such an opinion, and at such an unpardonable “closing of eyes” to the present-day “vacillation of thought”! At the end of his article Struve particularly requests my views on the ques-tions raised by the so-called “critics. 
” I would reply to this that whatspecially interests me just now is the contemporary eclectic trend inphilosophy and in political economy, and that I still hope at somefuture date to present a systematic analysis of this trend; 178 but to chase after every single “fundamental error” and “fundamental antinomy” ... of eclecticism is (I ask the pardon of the respected “crit-ics”!) simply uninteresting. 
 That is why I shall confine myself forthe moment to putting forward a counter-suggestion. 
 Let the new“critical trend” take the most definite shape, and not limit itself tomere hints. 
 The sooner this happens the better, for then the less will be the confusion and the more clearly will the public appreciate the difference between Marxism and the new “trend” in the bourgeoiscriticism of Marx. 
 N O T E S 1Lenin’s book The Development of Capitalism in Russia w a s the result of tremendous research lasting more than three years. 
Lenin began intensive work on his book when in prison, soon afterhis arrest in connection with the case of the St. 
 Petersburg “Leagueof Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class,”and finished it in the village of Shushenskoye where he livedin exile. 
 He had, however, been gathering material for his booklong before he began writing it. 
 In his first letter from prison, dated January 2, 1896, Lenin wrote: “I have a plan that has occupied my mind considerablyever since I was arrested, increasingly so as time passes. 
 I havelong been engaged on an economic problem (that of the market-ing of the products of manufacturing industry within thecountry), have selected some literature, drawn up a plan for itsanalysis and have even done some writing with a view tohaving my work published in book form, should its dimensionsexceed those of a magazine article. 
 I should be very unwillingto give up the job, and am now, apparently, faced with thealternative of either writing it here or of abandoning italtogether. 
” (See present edition Vol. 
 37. 
) In the same letter, in addition to giving instructions about books to be obtained according to a list he had drawn up,Lenin unfolded his plan of work: “The list of books,” he wrote, “is divided into the two parts into which my book is divided. 
 A—The general theoreticalpart. 
 This requires fewer books, so that, in any case, I hopeto write it, although it needs more preparatory work. 
 B—Theapplication of the theoretical principles to Russian facts. 
 Thispart requires very many books. 
 The chief difficulty will be:1) Zemstvo publications. 
 Part of them, by the way, I already have,but another part (small monographs) may be ordered, and apart may be obtained through statisticians I know; 2) Governmentpublications—the papers of commissions, reports and minutes ofcongresses, etc. 
 These are important, but they are more difficultto obtain. 
 Some of them, even the majority, I think, are in thelibrary of the Free Economic Society. 
” (See present edition, Vol. 
 37. 
) Lenin’s sister, A. 
 I. 
 Ulyanova-Elizarova, relates in her rem-iniscences that while Vladimir Ilyich was working on his book in prison “he decided to use the St. 
 Petersburg libraries in order to obtain material needed for the work he had planned and that he knew he would not be able to get in exile. 
 And so in prison he made an intense study of a mass of source mate-rial, and copied out numerous extracts. 
 I dragged heaps of books to him from the Free Economic Society library, from the Academy of Sciences and from other scientific book repositories. 
” Lenin also worked on the book while on his way to exile. 
 In a letter dated March 15, 1897, he wrote that while on the way he had looked over some “books borrowed for a short while,” and that he intended to send them back from Krasnoyarsk. 
 During a halt at Krasnoyarsk (en route for Shushenskoye village), Lenin made a study of books and magazines that he found in the rich private library of G. 
 V. 
 Yudin, a merchant, and also in the local city library. 
 While in exile Lenin continued to work hard on The Develop-ment of Capitalism in Russia . 
 Since he did not possess the means to buy large numbers of books, he wrote to his relatives asking them to make arrangements to supply him from libraries in the capital. 
 “... It would very likely be more profitable for me to spend money on postage and have many books than to spend much more money on buying a few books. 
” (See present edition, Vol. 
 37. 
) On Lenin’s instructions, his sister, M. 
 I. 
 Ulyanova, copied out numerous extracts from various books in the Rumyantsev Library in Moscow. 
 Lenin received these extracts at the end of May 1897. 
 From the autumn of the same year, he received the material he needed regularly and set to work on the new sources, particularly on the numerous statistical abstracts. 
 In the spring of 1898, N. 
 K. 
 Krupskaya, who had secured a transfer from her place of exile in Ufa to Shushenskoye, brought Lenin many books. 
 During his three years’ work on The Development of Capital-ism in Russia , Lenin studied and made a critical analysis of everything that had been written on Russian economics. 
 In this monograph mention is made of, and passages are quoted from, over 500 different books, abstracts, research papers, reviews and articles. 
 The literature, however, actually studied and used by Lenin, but not included among the sources he men-tions, was much more extensive . 
 But even this list gives an idea of the colossal amount of work involved in his study of the development of Russian capitalism. 
 The draft of The Development of Capitalism in Russia w a s completed in August 1898. 
 In a letter dated October 11, 1898 Lenin wrote: “I have finished drafting my markets, and I have begun to give them the finishing touches. 
 The making of a fair copy will go on simultaneously, so that I have thought of sending it on in parts and of having it printed as it gets there in order to avoid delay (I expect to send off the first lot in a month’s time at the very latest); if they begin printing it in December, it might just be in time for this season. 
” (See present edition, Vol. 
 37. 
) Much time was needed to give the manuscript the finishing touches and the job was completed at the end of January 1899. 
 Lenin paid careful attention to the remarks of comrades and relatives who read The Development of Capitalism while it was still in manuscript. 
 Each chapter was copied into a separate little notebook, and, apart from Krupskaya, was read and discussed by other Social-Democrats who were in exile at that time in the Minusinsk area. 
 “We were the ‘first readers,’ so to speak, of The Development of Capitalism in Russia ,” wrote G. 
 M. 
 Krzhi-zhanovsky in his reminiscences (he lived in exile not far from Shushenskoye village). 
 “Whatever was sent to us, we read care-fully and returned it to Lenin with our comments. 
 He took our comments very much into consideration. 
” The Development of Capitalism in Russia came off the press at the end of March, 1899, under the pseudonym of “Vladimir Ilyin. 
” The issue of 2,400 copies was sold out very quickly and circulated mainly among the Social-Democratic intel-ligentsia, the student youth, and also through the medium of propagandists in workers’ study circles. 
 The bourgeois press tried to pass over Lenin’s monograph in silence, and the first reviews did not appear until the autumn of 1899. 
 One of them received a crushing retort from Lenin in his article “Uncritical Criticism,” which was printed in the mag-azine Nauchnoye Obozreniye (Scientific Review ) for May-June 1900 (see pp. 
 609-32 in this volume). 
 A second edition of The Development of Capitalism in Russia appeared in 1908. 
 Since the establishment of Soviet power The Development of Cap-italism in Russia has, according to data as of October 1, 1957, been published 75 times, in a total of 3,372,000 copies and in 20 of the languages of the Soviet peoples. 
 In addition it has appeared in the English, French, German, Spanish, Chinese, Czech, Hungarian, Japanese, Turkish and other foreign languages. 
 Part of the preparatory work for The Development of Capital-ism in Russia , which shows the volume of the research done by Lenin, and the methods he employed, has been published in the Lenin Miscellany XXXIII . 
 The present volume follows the second, 1908, edition, which was published after the text had been corrected and supplemented by Lenin. 
 In addition, account has been taken of all the author’s remarks concerning the first, 1899, edition.

 25 In February or at the beginning of March 1899, when in exile, Lenin received a copy of Die Agrarfrage (The Agrarian Question ) by Kautsky, then still a Marxist. 
 By then, the greater2 3 4 5 6part of The Development of Capitalism in Russia had been set up in type, and so Lenin decided to make reference to Kautsky’s work in the preface. 
 On March 17 (29), 1899, Lenin sent a postscript to the preface. 
 “If only it is not late,” he wrote, “I would very much like to have it printed.... 
 Maybe even if the preface is already set, it will still be possible to add the postscript?” The addition to the preface got into the hands of the censor and was changed. 
 In a letter dated April 27 (May 9), 1899, Lenin wrote of this: “Have heard that my P. 
S. 
 to the pref-ace was late, fell into the hands of the preliminary censor and ‘suffered,’ I think. 
” p. 
 26 In the second edition of The Development of Capitalism in Russia the numbering of the sections was changed through Lenin’s introduction of several additions. 
 The item to which Lenin refers the reader is in Chapter II, §XII, C, p. 
 162 and p. 
 168. 
 p. 
 27 On February 17, 1899, in the Society for the Promotion of Rus-sian Industry and Trade, a discussion took place on a paper entitled “Is It Possible to Reconcile Narodism with Marxism?” Representatives of liberal Narodism as well as “Legal Marxists” took part in the discussion. 
 V. 
 P. 
 Vorontsov (V. 
 V. 
) said that those who represented the “modern trend of Marxism in the West” stood closer to Russian Narodism than to the Russian Marxists. 
 A brief report of this meeting appeared on February 19 (March 3), 1899, in the reactionary St. 
 Petersburg paper, Novoye Vremya (New Times ). 
 p. 
 28 The second edition of The Development of Capitalism in Russia was published in 1908. 
 An announcement of its publication appeared in March 1908, in Knizhnaya Letopis (Book Chronicle ), Issue No. 
 10. 
 For the second edition Lenin went over the text, eliminated printer’s errors made numerous additions and wrote a new preface, dated July 1907. 
 In the second edition of The Devel-opment of Capitalism in Russia Lenin replaced the expressions “disciples,” and “supporters of the working people,” which he had employed so as to pass the censorship, by the forthright terms Marxists, Socialists. 
 He also replaced allusions to “the new theory” by references to Marx and Marxism. 
 Lenin made considerable additions, employing the very latest statistics. 
 He introduced into the second chapter a new section (XI), devoted to an analysis of the results of the Army-Horse Censuses of 1896-1900. 
 He cited new facts in confirmation of his previous conclusions about the development of capitalism in Russia, in particular new factory statistical material; gave an analysis of the results of the general population census of 1897, which provided a fuller picture of the class structure of Russia (see Chapter VII, §V, pp. 
 501-507, Addendum to second edition ). 
 7 8In the second edition the results of the struggle against the so-called “Legal Marxists” on the basic problems dealt with in The Development of Capitalism in Russia are also summed up. 
 The experience of the first Russian Revolution of 1905-1907 fully confirmed Lenin’s description of the “Legal Marxists” as bourgeois liberals hiding behind the cloak of Marxism and attempting to use the working-class movement in the interests of the bourgeoisie. 
 He introduced 24 new footnotes into the second edition (pp. 
 27, 45, 57, 157, 159, 163, 183, 206, 221, 274, 281, 389, 449, 451, 467, 499, 509, 523, 526, 533, 535, 550, 552, 575), 2 new sections (pp. 
 146-148 and 501-507), a new table (p. 
 512), wrote 8 paragraphs of new text and 3 big additions to previous paragraphs (pp. 
 300-303, 223-224, 225, 293-294), and made about 75 additions and alterations. 
 Lenin did not cease working on his Development of Capitalism in Russia after the appearance of the second edition in 1908. 
 This is shown by the additions, made by him in 1910 or 1911 to page 405 of a copy of the second edition, dealing with the division of factories and works into groups according to the num-ber of workers employed in 1908 (see illustration on page 513 of the present volume). 
 In the preface to the second edition Lenin speaks of the pos-sibility of his revising the work in the future and indicates that in that case it would have to be divided into two volumes:— volume 1 to be devoted to an analysis of Russian economy before the Revolution and volume 2 to a study of the results and achievements of the Revolution. 
 A number of Lenin’s other works, including The Agrarian Programme of Social-Democracy in the First Russian Revolu-tion , 1905-1907 , which was written at the end of 1907, were devoted to a study of the results and achievements of the 1905-1907 Revolution.

 32 Cadets —members of the Constitutional-Democratic Party, the chief party of the Russian imperialist bourgeoisie. 
 The Cadet Party was founded in October 1905, its membership including representatives of the liberal-monarchist bourgeoisie, Zemstvo functionaries and bourgeois intellectuals who used hypocritical phrases about “democracy” to hide their real views and to win over the peasantry. 
 The Cadet agrarian programme envisaged the possibility of part of the landed estates being turned over to the peasants on the basis of redemption payments, but at an 9 10 11exorbitant price. 
 The Cadets favoured the retention of the monarchy and tried to persuade the tsar and the feudal landlords to share power with them; their main task, however, they considered to be the fight against the revolutionary movement. 
 During the First World War the Cadets actively supported the tsarist government’s foreign policy of conquest. 
 During the bourgeois-democratic revolution of February 1917 they tried to save the monarchy. 
 The Cadets in the bourgeois Provisional Government pursued a counter-revolutionary policy, opposed to the interests of the people but favourable to the U. 
S. 
, British and French imperialists. 
 Following the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution the Cadets became irreconcilable enemies of Soviet power and participated in all the armed counter-revolutionary actions and campaigns of the interventionists. 
 When the interventionists and whiteguards were defeated, the Cadets fled abroad, where they continued their anti-Soviet counter-revolutionary activity. 
 p. 
 33 The Party of Octobrists (or Union of October Seventeenth ) repre-sented the interests of the big industrial capitalists and of the big landlords who farmed their land on capitalist lines. 
 The Octobrists claimed to stand by the tsar’s Manifesto of October 17, 1905, in which, scared by the revolution, he promised the people civil rights; actually, however, the Octobrists had no intention of limiting the powers of tsarism, and fully supported both the home and the foreign policies of the tsar’s government. 
 p. 
 33 Stolypin , Pyotr Arkadyevich —Chairman of the Council of Min-isters, 1906-1911, an extreme reactionary. 
 The suppression of the Revolution of 1905-1907 and the period of severe polit-ical reaction that followed are connected with his name. 
 In an effort to provide the tsarist autocracy with a firm sup-port in the countryside in the shape of the kulaks, Stolypin secured the adoption of a new agrarian law. 
 By an edict of November 9, 1906, each peasant became entitled to withdraw from the village community and to have his allotment made his private property, with the ensuing right to sell it, mortgage it, etc. 
, which until then had been forbidden. 
 It was made the duty of the community to supply the peasant leaving its ranks with land in a single tract. 
 The kulaks made use of this legis-lation to buy up the lands of the economically weak peasants for next to nothing. 
 The laws of June 14, 1910, and of May 29, 1911, provided for a compulsory arrangement of land distribution that favoured the kulaks. 
 p. 
 33 June 3, 1907 , was the day on which the Second State Duma was disbanded and a new law was promulgated dealing with the elections to the Third State Duma, that ensured a majority for the landlords and capitalists in the Duma. 
 The tsar’s govern-ment treacherously violated the Manifesto of October 17, 1905, did away with constitutional rights and had the Social-12Democratic group in the Second Duma arraigned and sentenced to hard labour. 
 The so-called coup d’état of June 3 marked a tem-porary victory of the counter-revolution. 
 p. 
 34 Popular Socialists —members of the Popular Socialist Party, which separated from the right wing of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party (S. 
R. 
s) in 1906. 
 They expressed the interests of the kulaks and stood for the partial nationalisation of landed estates on a redemption basis and the distribution of the land among the peasants according to the so-called labour norm. 
 They favoured a bloc with the Cadets. 
 Lenin called them “Social-Cadets,” “petty-bourgeois opportunists,” and “S. 
R. 
 Mensheviks,” who vacil-lated between the Cadets and the S. 
R. 
s, and he emphasised that this party “differs very little from the Cadets, since it has with-drawn from its programme both the Republic and the demand for all the land. 
” The leading figures in the party were A. 
 V. 
 Peshe-khonov, N. 
 F. 
 Annensky, V. 
 A. 
 Myakotin, and others. 
 Following the February (1917) bourgeois-democratic revolution the Popu-lar Socialist Party participated in the bourgeois Provisional Government. 
 Following the October Socialist Revolution the Popular Socialists participated in counter-revolutionary plots and armed actions against the Soviets. 
 The party went out of existence during the Civil War. 
 Trudoviks (from trud , “labour”)—a group of petty-bourgeois democrats in the Russian State Dumas, consisting of peasants and also of Narodnik-minded intellectuals. 
 The Trudovik Group was constituted in April 1906 from the peasant deputies to the First State Duma. 
 The demands of the Trudoviks included the abolition of all restrictions based on the social estates and on nationality, the democratisation of the Zemstvos and urban local government bodies, and universal suffrage in the elections to the State Duma. 
 The Trudovik agrarian programme proceeded from the Narodnik principle of the equalitarian use of the land: the formation of a national fund made up of lands belonging to the state, the royal family, the tsar himself and the monasteries, and also of private estates where they exceeded the established labour norm, with provision for compensation in the case of confiscated private estates. 
 In the State Duma the Trudoviks vacillated between the Cadets and the Bolsheviks, their vacillations being due to the very class nature of the peasants who are petty proprietors. 
 In September 1906 Lenin pointed out that the Trudovik peasant “is not above trying to strike a deal with the monarchy and settling down on his patch of land within the framework of the bourgeois system. 
 At the present time, how-ever, his energies are mainly devoted to the struggle against the landlords for the land, to the struggle against the feudal state for democracy. 
” (See present edition, Vol. 
 11, An Attempt at a Clas-sification of the Political Parties of Russia . 
) Since the Trudoviks rep-resented the peasant masses, the tactics of the Bolsheviks in the Duma were to arrive at agreements with them on individual issues 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 242526 27 282930with a view to waging a joint struggle against the Cadets and the tsarist autocracy. 
 In 1917 the “Trudovik Group” merged with the “Popular Socialist” Party.

 Bernstein’s Die Voraussetzungen des Sozialismus und die Aufgaben der Sozialdemokratie (The Premises of Socialism and the Tasks of Social-Democracy ), which revised the principles of revolutionary Marxism in the spirit of bourgeois reformism, appeared in 1899. 
 Lenin received a copy of it when the first edition of his The Development of Capitalism in Russia had appeared, so that it was only in the second edition that he was able to include his remarks on Bernstein’s opportunist views. 
 Lenin calls Bernstein “famous after the fashion of Herostratos. 
” Tradition has it that Herostratos , a Greek who lived in the 4th century B. 
 C. 
, set fire to the noted temple of Artemis in his native town of Ephesus for the sole purpose of becoming known to posterity. 
 The name of Herostratos has become an epithet applied to individuals who are ready to commit crime for the sake of winning fame.

 65 Zemstvo house-to-house censuses were investigations of peasant farms undertaken by statistical agencies of the Zemstvos or rural government bodies. 
 These censuses, which were conducted mainly for taxation purposes, became very common in the 1880s. 
 The household censuses provided a wealth of factual material which was published in statistical abstracts covering the different gubernias and their uyezds or subdivisions. 
 The Zemstvo statisticians, however, many of whom were Narodniks, were very often biased in the way they processed the statistical data and classified them incorrectly, thereby robbing them of much of their value. 
 “Here is the weakest spot in our Zemstvo statis-tics, splendid as they are for the care and detail with which they are compiled,” wrote Lenin. 
 (See present edition, Vol. 
 20. 
) Phe-nomena of the economic type were hidden under piles of figures 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48in the Zemstvo returns and reviews, while the essential differences between, and features of, various peasant groupsthat took shape as capitalism developed were lost in the columns of average figures. 
 Lenin made a comprehensive analysis of Zemstvo statistical data, and carefully studied and processed them. 
 He made cal-culations of his own, drew up tables and statistical summaries, gave a Marxist analysis of the peasant-farm data secured, and grouped them scientifically. 
 Lenin used the wealth of Zemstvo statistical material to expose the artificiality of Narodnik schemes and to draw a true picture of Russia’s economic development. 
 He made extensive use of Zemstvo statistical material in his writings and especially in The Development of Capitalism in Russia .

 The first census was taken in 1876 in 33 gubernias in the west of Russia. 
 The second census was taken in 1882 and covered the whole of European Russia, the results being published in 1884 under the title Horse Census of 1882 . 
 In 1888 a census was taken in 41 gubernias, and in 1891 in the remaining 18 gubernias and in the Caucasus. 
 The examination of the data gathered was undertaken by the Central Statistical Committee, which published them in the abstracts: Statistics of the Russian Empire .

 The “Commission of Inquiry into 56 57 58 59 60Handicraft Industry in Russia” (called, for short, the “Handi-craft Commission”) was set up in 1874 under the auspices of the Council of Trade and Manufactures, at the request of the First All-Russia Congress of Owners of Factories and Works, that took place in 1870. 
 The Commission included representatives of the Ministries of Finance, Home Affairs, State Properties, and of the Russian Geographical Society, Free Economic Society, Moscow Agricultural Society, Russian Technical Society and Society for the Promotion of Russian Industry and Trade. 
 The valuable material published by the “Handicraft Commission” in its Transactions were mainly the fruits of the work of local, often little-known, officials. 
 Lenin, who made a detailed study of the Commission’s Transactions , drew from them numerous facts and figures showing the development of capitalist relations in Russia’s handicraft industry.

 The Free Economic Society (F.

) was a privileged scien-tific body, founded in 1765 with the aim, as its Statutes indicated of “disseminating information beneficial to agriculture and industry. 
” Scientists, from the ranks of liberal nobles or bourgeoisie, made up the membership of the F. 
E. 
S. 
 The Society undertook investigations by questionnaire and sent out expeditions to study various branches of the national economy and parts of the country; it periodically issued Transactions of the F.

 It ruined masses of peasants and at the same time hastened the process of the creation of a home market and the development of capi-talism in Russia. 
 This was dealt with by Engels in his article “Socialism in Germany. 
” He also referred to it in his letters to Nikolai —on dated October 29, 1891, March 15 and June 18, 1892.

 173 The Valuyev Commission —the “Commission to Investigate the Condition of Russian Agriculture ”which functioned under the chairmanship of the tsar’s minister P. 
 A. 
 Valuyev. 
 In the years 1872-1873 the Commission collected a large amount of material dealing with the condition of agriculture in post-Reform Russia: Governors’ reports, statements and depositions of land-lords, marshals of the nobility, Zemstvo administrations, volost boards, grain merchants, village priests, kulaks, statistical and agricultural societies and other bodies connected with agriculture. 
 This material was published in Papers of the Commission of Inquiry into the Condition of Russian Agricul-ture , St. 
 Petersburg, 1873.

 176 Gift-land peasants , those of the former landlords’ peasants, who, at the time of the Reform of 1861, by “agreement” with their landlords received their allotments as a gift (without having. 
 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81to redeem them). 
 The gilt-lander received a miserable strip, amount-ing altogether to a quarter of the so-called “top” or “statutory” allotment, i. 
e. 
, of the allotment established by law for the given locality. 
 All the rest of the lands that had constituted thepeasants’ allotments before the Reform were seized by the landlord, who held his “gift-landers,” forcibly dispossessed of their land, in a state of economic bondage even after serfdom wasabolished. 
 “Three-dayers ,” a category of allotment-holding agricultural wage-workers. 
 Farming the land he held on a poverty level,the “three-dayer” was a day labourer who, in return for grain or 20 to 30 rubles in cash, had to agree to conditions of bondage, or pay off the debt by working three days a week throughoutthe summer on the farm of the kulak or the landlord who made the loan. 
 This type of allotment-holding agricultural labourer was met with on a particularly extensive scale in the north-western gubernias of tsarist Russia.

 184 The first six sections of this chapter originally appeared as an article in the journal Nachalo (Beginning ), Issue No. 
 3, March 1899 (pp. 
 96-117) under the title of “The Dislodgement of Corvée by Capitalist Economy in Contemporary Russian Agri-culture. 
” The article was accompanied by the following editorialnote: “This article is an extract from the author’s considerable investigation of the development of capitalism in Russia.

, which the landlords “cut off,” i. 
e. 
, of which they deprived the peasants when serfdom was abolished in Russia. 
 p. 
 194 Temporarily-bound peasants —serfs who, after the abolition of serfdom in 1861, were obliged to perform certain services for the landlords, i. 
e. 
, do corvée service or pay quit-rent. 
The “temporarily-bound status” continued until the peasants, by agreement with the landlords, had acquired their allotments by the payment of redemption money. 
 The landlords wereobliged to accept redemption payments only after the edict of 1881, by which the “obligatory relation” between the peasants and the landlords had to cease as from January 1, 1883. 
 p. 
 194 The two volumes of The Influence of Harvests and Grain Prices on Certain Aspects of the Russian National Economy reached Lenin in the village of Shushenskoye in 1897. 
 He made a careful study of them while working on The Development of Capitalism in Russia , as is proved by his numerous marginal comments in the volumes. 
 While he exposed the method which the Narodniks were so fond of employing, the distortion of the actual situation by quoting “average” statistics which in factobscured the differentiation of the peasantry, Lenin carefully checked and made use of the concrete material in the volumes. 
 Thus, on page 153 of Vol. 
 1 Lenin drew up a table showing thedistribution, in the different gubernias of Russia, of the various forms of economy (capitalist, labour-service, and mixed). 
 This material, along with some additions from other sources, wentto make up the table given in the text. 
 p. 
 196 Cultivation of cycles —an enslaving form of labour-service rendered to the landlord by the peasant as rental for land obtained from him in post-Reform Russia. 
 The landlord lent the peasant land or made him a loan in cash or kind for which the peasantundertook to cultivate a “cycle,” using his own implements and draught animals; this meant cultivating one dessiatine of spring crops and one of winter crops, occasionally supplemented byreaping a dessiatine of crops. 
 p. 
 198 Skopshchina —the name given in the southern parts of Russia to the payment of land rent in kind, on terms of bondage, the tenant paying the landowner “s kopny” (from the corn-shock) a portion of the harvest (a half, and sometimes more), and usuallyfulfilling miscellaneous labour services in addition. 
 p. 
 201 Villeins —feudally dependent peasants in ancient Rus (9th-13th centuries) who performed corvée service for the princes and other temporal and clerical lords and also paid rent in kind. 
 The feudal lords seized the land of the villeins and com-pelled them to work on the feudal estates. 
 88 89 90 91 92 93Russkaya Pravda (Russian Law )—the first written codifi-cation of laws and princes’ decrees (11th-12th centuries). 
 The statutes of the Russkaya Pravda protected the lives and property of the feudal lord and are indicative of the bitter class struggle between peasants in feudal bondage and their exploiters.

 A character in Goncharov’s novel of that name. 
 p. 
 218 Pindar —ancient Greek lyrical poet. 
 Of his numerous works, four volumes of poems have survived in which he extols the victors at the games. 
 Pindar’s name has become an epithet used to designate those who “eulogise” beyond measure. 
 In speaking of the Pindar of the capitalist factory Lenin has in mind the term applied by Marx in Capital , Volume I, to that apologist of capitalism, Dr. 
 Ure.

 The proposal was rejected by the Reichstag.

 329 Lenin gives an appreciation of the research done by Bücher, and of the latter’s classification of the stages and forms of industrial development, in Chapter VII of The Development of Capitalism in Russia , in his footnote on page 550. 
 The most important part of Bücher’s work, that devoted to the origin of the national economy, was translated into Russian by Lenin appar-ently when he was in exile, in the village of Shushenskoye. 
 Lenin’s translation has not been published.

 374 State peasants with quarter holdings —the name given in tsarist Russia to the category of former state peasants, descendants of lower-rank servicemen who in the 16th to 17th centuries were settled in the border lands of the state of Muscovy. 
 For their services in guarding the state frontiers the settlers (Cossacks musketeers, soldiers) were given the use of small plots of land either temporarily or in perpetuity. 
 The area of such a plot amounted to a so-called quarter [1. 
35 acres]. 
 From the year 1719 such settlers were called odnodvortsi [i. 
e. 
, those possessing only their own farmsteads and no community land]. 
 Formerly they enjoyed various kinds of privileges and had the right to own peasants, but during the 19th century were gradually deprived of these rights and reduced to the status of ordinary peasants. 
 By a regulation of 1866 the quarter lots were recognised as the private property of the former quarter-lot peasants and their descendants.

 415 The Law of June 2, 1897 established a working day of 11 2 hours for industrial enterprises and railway workshops. 
 Prior to theadoption of this law the working day in Russia was unlimitedand lasted as long as 14 and 15 hours and even more. 
 The tsar’sgovernment was forced to adopt this law due to the pressureof the working-class movement, which was led by the “Leagueof Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class” headedby Lenin. 
 A detailed analysis and criticism of the law is givenby Lenin in his pamphlet: The New Factory Law .

 423 Prior to 1864 the gunsmiths of Tula were serfs of the state and lived in special suburbs (slobodas). 
 (The state blacksmiths’sloboda, etc. 
) They were divided into guilds: barrel, gun-stock,lock, instrumental, etc. 
 For the carrying out of auxiliary workserf-peasants from a number of villages were attached to the Tulaarms factories, their task being to prepare charcoal for the gun-smiths, guard the forests allocated to the factories, and do jobsin the factory yards. 
 141 142 143144145 146 147 148 149 150In Tula at the time of their liberation from feudal dependence there were nearly 4,000 gunsmiths, of whom 1,276 were employedin factories and 2,362 worked at home. 
 In all, the gunsmithsand their families numbered over 20,000. 
 p. 
 424 Lenin refers here to the factory owned by the St. 
 Petersburg Footwear Manufacturing Company, established in 1878. 
 In1894-95 the factory employed 845 workers and the value ofits output was 1,287,912 rubles (figures taken from the List of Factories and Works , St.

 451 To characterise the development of large-scale industry in tsarist Russia in the post-Reform period Lenin examined thematerial contained in numerous factory statistical sourcesof that period (statistical returns, monographs and works ofresearch, official reference books, magazine and newspaperreports, papers, etc. 
). 
 Lenin’s work of checking, processing,combining and scientifically grouping statistical data is shown inthe notes he made in various books and from other materialpublished in section 2 of Lenin Miscellany XXXIII .

 488 In the first edition of The Development of Capitalism in Russia the table contained the figures for the years 1890 and 1896. 
 In the second edition these figures were omitted. 
 Furthermore, the figures for 1897 differed somewhat from those for the same year cited in the second edition. 
 The corresponding part of the table as it appeared in the first edition was as follows: 1890 56,560 100 28,174 49.

 1). 
” p. 
 489 Lenin supplemented this table later with the corresponding figures for 1908 (see illustration on p. 
 513). 
 The data entered by Lenin were taken from Collection of Factory Inspectors ’ Reports for 1908 (no. 
 50-51), published in 1910.
