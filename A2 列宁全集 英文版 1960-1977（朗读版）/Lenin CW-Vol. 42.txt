432 433433 435437439 443 445449450455 457 462 463 495 623 PREFACE Volume Forty -Two contains items written after the Octo -ber Revolution, which were first published in the Complete Russian Edition of Lenin’s Collected Works or which were published in Lenin Miscellanies , magazines and newspapers. 
 These documents form an important supplement to the works included in the various volumes of this edition. 
 The first group of documents dates to the period from November 1917 to July 1918—the period of continueddevelopment of the socialist revolution and consolidationof Soviet power. 
 Mention should be made first of all of “Theses on the Tasks of the Party & the Present Situation”, the article “Plekhanov on Terror”, the “Draft Resolutionfor the C. 
C. 
, R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
(B. 
) Concerning the Expulsionfrom the Party of S. 
 A. 
 Lozovsky”, the “Outline of a Pro -gramme of Economic Measures” and a number of chaptersof the original version of the article “The Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Government”. 
 These deal with the tasks that faced the working class after the conquest of power, stressthe necessity for strengthening the dictatorship of theproletariat and suppressing the resistance of the overthrownexploiting classes, and sharply criticise the Right -opportunist elements within the Party. 
 Several documents relate to Lenin’s fight to get Russia out of the war, to conclude the Brest peace treaty (“Speechat a Joint Meeting of the Bolshevik and Left S. 
R. 
 Groupsin the All -Russia Central Executive Committee, February 19, 1918”, “Speech to the Lettish Riflemen, February 20, 1918”and others). 
 The numerous decisions for the Council of People’s Commissars drafted by Lenin reflect the first steps of the Communist Party and the Soviet Government in thefield of political, economic and cultural activities. 
 A large part of the materials relate to the period of foreign military intervention and the civil war, among them: notes on “The Tasks and Organisation of the Work of the Council of Defence”, “Notes at a Meeting of theCommission on Cartridges”, “Draft Resolution for the C. 
CR. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
) on Sending Groups of Workers Out on FoodTransportation Jobs”, “Draft Decision for the Council ofDefence on the Mobilisation of Soviet Employees”, “Draft Decisions for the C. 
C. 
 Politbureau on Measures to Fight Mamontov”, “Proposals on Military Questions”, “Decisionsof the Politbureau of the C. 
C. 
, R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
) on the Orderof the Revolutionary Military Council of the Western Front”and Lenin’s speeches: “Speech to Ivanovo -Voznesensk Communist Workers Leaving for the Front, October 24, 1919”, “Speech at the Eleventh Issue of Red Commanders of the First Moscow Machine -Gunners Training Courses, May 12, 1920”, “Report on the Internal and ExternalPosition of the Republic at a Meeting of Activists of theMoscow Organisation of the R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
), October 9, 1920”. 
These and many other documents strikingly illustrate the gigantic activities of the Central Committee and the Soviet Government, headed by Lenin, in organising the defeatof the interventionists and whiteguards. 
 A considerable part of the volume is made up of items and documents written after the war, when the problems ofeconomic rehabilitation and socialist construction bulked large. 
 Industry, agriculture, science and technology, public education, improvement of the machinery of state, thenational question, foreign policy—all these problems weredealt with daily by Lenin, who directed the activitiesof the Party and the Government The items included in this volume contain important supplementary material showing how Lenin worked on the plan of socialist construction. 
 Of great significance are the chapters of the original version of “The Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Government”(the end of Chapter IV, chapters V -IX and the beginning of Chapter X) which were first published in 1962. 
 In these chapters Lenin sets forth in greater detail than in the final text a number of questions relating to the task of startingconstruction of a new society and reveals the importance of solving economic problems and the need for proper management of the national economy during the period of transition from capitalism to socialism. 
 In interviews given to Lincoln Eyre, correspondent of the Americannewspaper The World , and to the correspondent of the Japanese newspaper Osaka Asahi and in his “Notes on Electrification” Lenin characterises the role of electrificationin building the economic foundation of socialism and devel -oping the productive forces. 
 Questions of the New EconomicPolicy are dealt with in the “Reply to the Debate on theReport on Concessions” at the meeting of the Communistgroup of the All -Russia Central Council of Trade Unions on April 11, 1921, in speeches made at the Tenth All -Russia Conference of the R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
) during the debate on the resolution on questions of the New Economic Policy, and in a letter “To the Russian Colony in North America”. 
 Consistent application of democratic centralism in running the economy, scientific planning, rational and efficientmanagement, proper organisation of labour, the introductionof cost accounting, the running of enterprises on a paying basis, and the use of moral and material incentives for developing production were considered by Lenin to bethe most vital principles and methods of socialist manage -ment. 
 Mention can here be made of such documents as the“Speech at a Meeting of the Presidium of the S. 
E. 
C. 
, April 1,1918”, “Comments on the Draft ‘Regulations for the Management of the Nationalised Enterprises’”, “Salaries for Specialists”, “Addendum to the Draft Regulations on Subbot -niks”, “Draft of the Main Point of the C. 
L. 
D. 
 Decision onthe General Planning Commission”, “Plan of an Article‘Commercial Organisation’”, “Motion to the Politbureau ofthe C. 
C. 
, R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
) on Bonuses for Enterprises” and others. 
 Defining the tasks of economic construction in his “Plan of a Speech at the Trade Union Congress”, Lenin wrote:“Work discipline, higher labour productivity, work organi -sation, increased output, relentless fight against slipshodwork and red tape. 
 By this sign shall ye conquer” (p. 
 308). 
Materials such as: “Addendum to the Draft Decision for the C. 
P. 
C. 
 ‘On the Distribution of Agricultural Machines’”, “Draft Decision for the C. 
L. 
D. 
 on Fowler Ploughs”, thedraft decision on “Measures for Improving the Organisation of State Farms” and others show Lenin’s concern for the revival of agriculture, for the supply of the peasants with machines, for the development of the state farms, for support of the co -operatives on the part of the state and for the creation of conditions for the socialist transformation ofthe village. 
 A number of materials deal with questions of cultural development: the draft decision for the C. 
P. 
C. 
 on “Library Organisation”, “Instructions for Compiling a Reading Book for Workers and Peasants”, “Draft Decision for the Polit -bureau of the C. 
C. 
, R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
) on the Chief Committee forPolitical Education”, “Rough Draft of a Resolution onProletarian Culture”, “Addendum to the Draft Decision forthe C. 
P. 
C. 
 on an Obligatory Science Minimum in the Higher Schools”, “Draft Decision for the Plenum of the C. 
C. 
, R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
) on the Reorganisation of the People’s Commis -sariat for Education”, “Directives on the Film Business”. 
These and other documents contain important propositionsregarding the substance and ways of effecting a culturalrevolution, the communist education of the working people, the political enlightenment of the masses. 
 Of exceptionally great significance is the letter “On the Establishment of the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
” in which Lenin put forwardthe idea of creating a Union of Soviet Socialist Republicsas a single multinational socialist state based on a voluntaryassociation of equal and sovereign Soviet Republics. 
 Questions concerning the national policy of the Communist Party and the Soviet Government are dealt with also in the“Notes at a Meeting of Delegates to the Second All -Russia Congress of Communist Organisations of the Peoples of theEast”, “Draft Decision for the Politbureau of the C. 
C. 
,R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
) on the Tasks of the R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
) in Turkestan”, “Draft Decision for the Politbureau of the C. 
C. 
, R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
) on the Tasks of the R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
) in Localities Inhabited byEastern Peoples” and other items, in which Lenin urgesthe need for unity and fraternal co -operation among all the nationalities of the Soviet land and for waging a vigorousfight against chauvinism and nationalism. 
 The speech winding up the debate on the report on con -cessions at the meeting of the R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
) group at the Eighth Congress of Soviets contains Lenin’s important thesis on Soviet patriotism: “The patriotism of a person who is prepared to go hungry for three years rather than surrender Russia to foreigners is genuine patriotism, without which we could not hold out for three years. 
 Without this patriotismwe would not have succeeded in defending the Soviet Repub -lic, in doing away with private property.... 
 This is thefinest revolutionary patriotism” (p. 
 245). 
 In his note “The Democratism and Socialist Nature of Soviet Power” and his “Speech at a Meeting in Presnya District, July 26, 1918”, Lenin characterises the Sovietsand reveals the genuine democratism of the Soviet Consti -tution. 
 Many documents reflect Lenin’s efforts to improve the working of the machinery of state, and strengthen state, Party and public control: “Proposals for the Distribution of Functions Between the Deputy Chairmen of the C. 
P. 
C. 
and the C. 
L. 
D. 
”, “Proposals Concerning the Work Routine ofthe Deputy Chairmen and the Chairman of the C. 
P. 
C. 
”, “Letterto L. 
 B. 
 Kamenev, A. 
 I. 
 Rykov and A. 
 D. 
 Tsyurupa on theDistribution of Work Between the Deputy Chairmen of the C. 
P. 
C. 
 and the C. 
L. 
D. 
”, “Politbureau of the C. 
C. 
, R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
) Directives on a Workers’ Inspection”, “Materials to theArticle ‘How We Should Reorganise the Workers’ andPeasants’ Inspection’”, etc. 
 A number of documents aredevoted to the strengthening of socialist legality: “RoughTheses of a Decision on the Strict Observance of the Laws”, “Proposals Concerning the Work of the Vecheka”, “Speech at the Fourth Conference of Gubernia Extraordinary Commis -sions, February 6, 1920” and others. 
 Lenin regarded the Communist Party as the guiding and directing force of Soviet society. 
 He never relaxed hisefforts to strengthen the ideological and organisational unity of the Party, he urged the need for doing everything to develop inner -Party democracy, to rigidly adhere to the principle of collective leadership and to strengthen theParty’s ties with the masses. 
 These questions are dealtwith in many documents included in this volume: “Speechon the Immediate Tasks of Party Development” at the Ninth All -Russia Conference of the R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
), draft resolution and proposals for the resolution on this question,speech to the R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
) group at the Eighth Congress of Soviets during the debate on the report of the All -Russia C. 
E. 
C. 
 and C. 
P. 
C. 
 concerning home and foreign policies, “Speech at a Meeting of Moscow Party Activists, February 24, 1921”, “Draft of a Letter of the C. 
C. 
, R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
) on theAttitude to Non -Party Workers”, “Outline of a Speech at a Meeting of Supporters of the ‘Platform of Ten’”—delegatesto the Tenth Congress of the R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
), “Remarks Con -cerning the Work Plan of the C. 
C. 
, R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
)”. 
 Lenin’s draft resolution for the Politbureau of the C. 
C. 
 con -cerning Maxim Gorky’s articles in the magazine Communist International is a striking illustration of his high -principled attitude, his intolerance towards the cult of personality. 
 Of great importance is the series of documents dealing with the Soviet state’s foreign policy: the interviews with foreign correspondents, the “Draft Directives to the Deputy Chairman and All Members of the Genoa Delegation”,“Draft Directives of the C. 
C. 
, R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
) for the SovietDelegation to the Genoa Conference”, “Draft Decision for theC. 
C. 
, R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
) on the Tasks of the Soviet Delegation atGenoa”, “Amendments and Remarks to the Draft Declaration of the Soviet Delegation at the Genoa Conference” and others, which formulate the fundamental principles of the SovietRepublic’s foreign policy and the aims and methods of Sovietdiplomacy. 
 These documents show how consistently the Soviet Government, headed by Lenin, pursued its policy of peace and establishment of business relations with the capitalist countries. 
 In his interview given to an American correspon -dent, Lenin said: “I know of no reason why a socialisticcommonwealth like ours cannot do business indefinitelywith capitalistic countries” (p. 
 177). 
 At the same time theSoviet Government strongly rebuffed all attempts of the imperialist powers to interfere in the internal affairs of the Soviet Republic or to impose upon it fettering terms of aneconomic agreement. 
 Lenin said: “We have reiterated andreiterated our desire for peace .... 
 But we do not propose to be strangled to death for the sake of peace” (ibid. 
). 
 Notable items in this volume are the documents which reveal the friendly fraternal relations between the Soviet state and the countries where the people had come to power. 
This volume contains the draft decisions for the C. 
P. 
C. 
 concerning a treaty with the Socialist Workers’ Republic of Finland. 
 This was the first treaty in history to be signed between two socialist republics, and represented a new type of international relations between equal sovereign states. 
The text of Lenin’s “Talk With a Delegation of the MongolianPeople’s Republic” contains important guidelines on thepaths of development towards socialism for countries witha pre -capitalist social system, and on the specific features of the tactics which the revolutionary parties in these countries should adopt. 
 The writings included in this volume are a valuable supplement to the well -known works of Lenin dealing with the international labour and communist movements. 
 Mentionshould first of all be made of Lenin’s letter to Chicherin (at the end of December 1918) outlining the basic ideological platform and organisational principles of the CommunistInternational. 
 Of considerable interest are the materialsrelating to the Second Congress of the Comintern—the“Plan of a Resolution Concerning the Meaning of the Concept‘Dictatorship of the Proletariat’ and the Fight Against the ‘Fashionable’ Distortion of This Slogan”, “Remarks on the Report of A. 
 Sultan -Zade Concerning the Prospects of a Social Revolution in the East” and others. 
 A number ofdocuments deal with the Third Congress of the Cominternand show what a tremendous job Lenin performed inpreparing the basic decisions of the Congress and guiding its proceedings. 
 These include: “Letter to O. 
 W. 
 Kuusinen and Remarks on the Draft ‘Theses on the OrganisationalActivities of the Communist Parties, on the Methods andContant of Their Work’”, “Remarks on the Draft Theses onTactics for the Third Congress of the Communist Interna -tional”, “Speeches at a Meeting of Members of the German Polish, Czechoslovak, Hungarian and Italian Delegations”. 
 These documents reflect the irreconcilable struggle which Lenin carried on against Right -wing opportunism, reformism and revisionism, and at the same time against Leftism,adventurism, dogmatism and sectarianism in the interna -tional communist movement. 
 They contain very important guidelines on questions of the strategy and tactics of the international communist movement. 
 The Communist Parties,Lenin emphasised, should focus their attention on the task of winning over the majority of the working class, the bulk of the working masses, and prepare them for the socialist revolution. 
 In a number of documents—“Draft Decision of the Politbureau of the C. 
C. 
, R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
) on the Tacticsof the United Front”, “Letter to Members of the Politbureauof the C. 
C. 
, R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
) with Remarks to the Draft Resolutionfor the First Extended Plenary Meeting of the CominternExecutive on Participation in a Conference of the Three Internationals”, “Proposal to the Draft Resolution for the Eleventh Party Congress on the Report of the R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
)Delegation in the Comintern”—Lenin argues the case forthe tactics of a united front, the adoption of a united actionby the working class. 
 The Appendix to the volume contains questionnaires filled in by Lenin in the capacity of delegate to Communist Party congresses and conferences, in the course of reregistra -tion of members of the Moscow organisation of the R. 
C. 
P. 
and under the All -Russia census of the R. 
C. 
P. 
 members. 
 Of considerable interest are the records of Lenin’s official orders and instructions, reception of visitors and other facts entered in the Journal of Lenin’s Duty Secretaries. 
 This document reveals how manfully Lenin fought hisillness, giving all his strength to the cause of the Party,the cause of the working class.

 “What do you think of the results of the elections to the Con -stituent Assembly?” the correspondent asked. 
 “I think that these elections have proved a great victory for the Bolshevik Party. 
 The number of votes castfor it in the elections in May, August and in September isconstantly growing. 
 4 To get six seats out of twelve in a city in which the bourgeoisie (Cadets5) are strongest, means to win in Russia. 
” “Do you suppose that the Constituent Assembly of such composition as the results of the elections in Petrograd indicate will sanction allthe measures of the Government of National Commissioners?” “Yes, it will sanction, because there will be no majority, according to your supposition, against us, and together with the left social revolutionists6 we shall constitute a majority in Petrograd (seven out of twelve). 
” “What parties will enter into the new Council of National Commissioners?” “I do not know positively, but I think that only the left social revolutionists, besides the Bolsheviks.

 Lenin * Written December 19, 1917 (January 1, 1918 ) First published in 1933 Printed from the manuscript in Lenin Miscellany XXI PLEKHANOV ON TERROR There was a time when Plekhanov was a socialist, a prominent exponent of revolutionary socialism. 
 At that time—now, alas, in the limbo of forgotten things— Plekhanov expressed his opinion on a subject which happensto have vital significance in the present period. 
 It happened in 1903, when the Russian Social -Democrats were framing their programme at the Second Party Congress. 
 The minutes of this Congress contain the following very informative entry, that might have been written speciallyfor the present day: “Posadovsky . 
 The statements made here for and against the amendments strike me as being not a dispute over details but a seriousdifference of opinion; without a doubt we disagree on the followingfundamental question: should our future policy be governed by certain basic democratic principles , admitted to have absolute value , or are all democratic principles to be governed exclusively by what is profitable for our party ? I definitely declare for the latter. 
 There is no democratic principle that we could not make subservient to the interests of our party . 
 (Interjection : “Even inviolability of the person?”) Yes! Inviolability of the person as well! As a revolutionary party strivingtowards its ultimate goal—that of a social revolution—we must regard democratic principles exclusively from the point of view of the speediest possible achievement of that goal, from the point of view ofour party’s interests. 
 If one or another demand does not turn out toour advantage we shall not use it. 
 “Therefore I oppose any amendments that are likely in future to narrow our freedom of action. 
” “Plekhanov . 
 I fully support what Comrade Posadovsky has said . 
 Every given democratic principle should be examined not on its own *This document was also signed by J. 
 V. 
 Stalin. 
— Ed. 
 merits in the abstract , but in its bearing on what may be called the basic principle of democracy , namely , on the principle that says : salus populi suprema lex *. 
 Translated into the language of the revolutionary , this means that the success of the revolution is the highest law . 
 If it were necessary for the success of the revolution to restrict the effect of one or another democratic principle , it would be criminal to stop at such a restriction . 
 As my own personal opinion I would say that even the principle of universal suffrage should be regarded from thepoint of view of this basic principle of democracy I have just mentioned . 
 Hypothetically it is conceivable that we , Social-Democrats , may have occasion to come out against universal suffrage . 
 The bourgeoisie of the Italian republics once deprived persons belonging to the nobilityof political rights . 
 The revolutionary proletariat could restrict the political rights of the upper classes the way these classes once restrictedthe political rights of the proletariat . 
 The fitness of such a measure could only be judged by the rule: salus revolutionis suprema lex . 
 The same point of view should be adopted by us on the question of the duration of parliaments . 
 If, on an impulse of revolutionary enthusiasm , the people were to elect a very good parliament , a sort of Chambre Introuv -able , we should try and make it a long parliament ; and if the elections turned out to be unfavourable w e should try and dismiss it not in two years ’ time , but if possible in two weeks ” (Minutes of the Second Congress of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L. 
P. 
, pp. 
 168-69). 
 The enemies of socialism may be deprived for a time not only of inviolability of the person, and not only of freedom of the press, but of universal suffrage as well. 
 A bad parlia -ment should be “dismissed” in two weeks. 
 The good of the revolution, the good of the working class, is the highestlaw. 
 That was how Plekhanov spoke when he was a socialist. 
That was how the great majority of the present -day Mensheviks spoke, those same Mensheviks who are now screaming about “Bolshevik terror”. 
 The “good of the revolution” now demands a grim fight against saboteurs, organisers of military cadet insurrections,and newspapers run by bankers. 
 When the Soviet authoritiesembark upon such struggle, the so -called socialists from the camp of the Mensheviks and S. 
R. 
s shout from all the house -tops against civil war and terror. 
 When that Kerensky24 of yours reintroduced capital punishment at the front, that was not terror, gentlemen,was it? When your coalition cabinet, with the hands of the Kornilovs, 25 machine -gunned whole regiments for showing *The welfare of the people is the highest law. 
— Ed. 
 insufficient enthusiasm for the war, that was not civil war, gentlemen, was it? When those Kerenskys and Avksentyevs26 of yours threw 3,000 soldiers into a single prison in Minsk for “harmfulagitation”, that was not terror, gentlemen, was it? When you suppressed the workers ’ newspapers, that was not terror, gentlemen, was it? The only difference is that the Kerenskys, Avksentyevs and Lieberdans, 27 hand in glove with the Kornilovs and Savinkovs,28 have practised terror against the workers , soldiers and peasants in the interests of a handful of land -owners and bankers, while the Soviet government is taking strong measures against the landowners, marauders andtheir underlings— in the interests of the workers , soldiers and peasants .

 GROUPS IN THE ALL -RUSSIA CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE FEBRUARY 19, 1918 BRIEF NEWSPAPER REPORT In a long speech lasting two hours, Lenin propounded the theses that there was no way out for Russia, that itwas necessary immediately to conclude a separate peace, since the Germans were advancing all along the front en masse and we were powerless to offer any resistance to this millio n-strong pressure. 
 Having concluded peace, we would be able to start putting things in order at home and deepe n-ing the socialist revolution, and we would succeed in completing the radical reforms that would bring us nearer to the introduction in Russia of a socialist system.

 In accordance with decisions of the Petrograd Soviet to be passed this evening, we advise you, without losing an hour, to rally all the workers in order to organise tens of thousands of workers and get all the bourgeoisie, everyone of them to a man, under the control of these workers, to dig trenches outside the city. 
 This is the only hope for the revolution. 
 The revolution is in danger. 
 The line of trenches will be marked out by the military. 
 Prepare the implements, most important of all organise and mobilise one and all.

P. 
C. 
 MARCH 4, 191852 1 I fully agree with Comrade Trutovsky that the tendencies and attempts of which we have heard here are completely at variance with the aims of the workers’ and peasants’ government and have nothing in common with socialism. 
53 The aim of socialism is to turn all the means of productioninto the property of the whole people, and that does notat all mean that the ships become the property of the shipworkers or the banks the property of the bank clerks. 
 If people take such paltry things seriously, then we must do away with nationalisation, 54 because the whole thing is preposterous. 
 The task, the aim of socialism, as we see it,is to convert the land and the industrial enterprises intothe property of the Soviet Republic. 
 The peasant receivesland on condition that he works it properly. 
 If the river transport workers receive ships, it is on condition that they take a proprietary interest in them: they must submittheir estimates if only in order to have income and expendi -ture endorsed, and they must take proper care of the ships. 
If they cannot do this, we shall remove them. 
 Seeing thatthey have been arguing for three weeks, I would propose removing all of them from the management, because this shows an utter inaptitude for organisation, a completefailure to grasp the vital tasks facing the Soviet Republic. 
It is chaos, disorganisation, even worse—it borders onsabotage. 
 They have started a sort of organised crusade in theUnion and come complaining. 
 Meanwhile, the boats on the Volga stand unrepaired. 
 What is this? What is it—a mad -house? I am perfectly sure that they realise that if we go on existing in this chaos we shall bring still greater calamitiesdown on our heads. 
 The chief condition with us is disciplineand the organised transfer of all property to the people,the transfer of all sources of wealth to the Soviet Republic, and their strictly disciplined disposal. 
 So when we are told that the river transport workers will be private managingproprietors, we obviously cannot agree to it. 
 Soviet power is to do the managing. 
 But you organise a sort of debate preventing unity among all organisations .... 
* If they are dissatisfied, they could have asked for the order to be rescind -ed. 
 But they are proposing again that it should be decided first whom the ships belong to, so that the ship workersshould demand a 140 per cent rise. 
 2 I fully agree with many things, but as to the make -up of the Board, I think the proposal of the river transportcomrades is absolutely unacceptable. 
 For one thing, that isnot the question we are dealing with. 
 The question at issue is that the men are not receiving their money. 
 That’s simply scandalous, of course. 
 What are we allocating money for?For it to remain on paper? We have heard a thousand com -plaints, that unless the money is sent, our transport willcollapse. 
 If the money was assigned on February 21, andon the 22nd it was not received, then they should have come on the 23rd complaining. 
 We are suffering from a money famine, we are short of currency notes, the treasury cannotprint all we need. 
 If we assign money and you unassign it,then actually nothing is sent. 
 You should have come hereon February 23, and not March 3. 
 We demanded that thesetens of millions should be given. 
 I don’t know who is more to blame. 
 I believe the representatives of the Economic Council. 
 We cannot satisfy everybody. 
 While we are supply -ing Petrograd, Moscow is hungering for currency notes... ** If people only wrote assignments and did not take anymeasures, they should have come here, or called me to thephone or somebody else, and complained about it. 
 It is a rare week when I do not receive a complaint about money not being paid out, but from you I never received a single com -plaint. 
 The people in charge should be made to answer forit, at least reprimanded. 
 Under the ruling of February 21the congress of river transport workers is obliged to submitthe estimates. 
 As regards the composition of the Management *Part of the shorthand report has not been deciphered.

 Board. 
 I think we should have corrected our decree rather in the vein Comrade Shlyapnikov suggested. 
 Paragraph 3 provides for a Board of seven members. 
 Why this wasn’t inserted is incomprehensible. 
 A number of trade unionrepresentatives could be included in it. 
 I propose thatresolute measures be taken to have this money forwardedimmediately by through goods trains. 
 Then notificationshould be sent in the usual way saying the money has been dispatched. 
 As regards the second point I believe the only Board possible in this instance and most acceptable foreveryone, for the Council of People’s Commissars—the onlypossible Board is the one appointed yesterday by the Councilof People’s Commissars. 
 There are no grounds for changingthis. 
 I believe we should put this through. 
 And if it’s really true about the 200 rubles salary, which was adopted as definite and made a condition for the nationalisation oftransport—if that’s a fact, and if demands are made forlevelling up with other organisations, then I personallyraise the question of cancelling nationalisation. 
 There maycome a time shortly when there will be no money at all. 
 We had a single guarantee on the basis of which we wanted to carry out nationalisation, and this is being taken awayfrom us. 
 If that’s the case, this measure should be revoked. 
Unless this is done we shall be taking on another respon -sibility incurring enormous losses. 
 3 I find the appointment of a commissar inconvenient in many respects. 
 We have no indisputable candidate for thispost. 
 Therefore we shall not satisfy all requirements, inas -much as both sides will be dissatisfied. 
 The appointmentof a commissar will mean setting aside the Union, and thatform is undemocratic. 
 We shall pass a decision for them tosubmit a proposal by the morning. 
 If the Board is toounwieldy it could elect an executive committee. 
 We canimplement that organisationally tomorrow or the day after and have the thing put through organisationally at once within a fixed period. 
 In appointing an executive committee,certain people could perhaps be appointed to it. 
 This would be correct, as we would not be setting aside the river trans -port workers. 
 They can have no objection to co-operation by the trade unions. 
 If this doesn’t go through, we can then go ahead with the appointment of a commissar. 
 The members of this Council know that the question of a candidate is, of course, a difficult one, and to decide now on appointing a commissar is to decide nothing, as we quite often waste a whole week over it. 
 It is best to use this method. 
 There remains one proposal—to revoke points 5, 6 and 7. 
 Adopted. 
 Under Paragraph 3 six Board members will be replaced by temporary representatives from the trade unions.

59 Which Russians < In Russia today there is one power, which by its nature is destined to wage a life and death struggle against the attacks of international imperialism—that is the Powerof the Soviets. 
 The first step, however, of those Russians,whom the Japanese intend to “help”, as soon as they heardrumours of the advance of the latter, was to demand theabolition of the Soviet Power. 
 Should the Japanese move into Siberia, these same “Russians” whom the Japanese are going to “help”, will demand the abolition of the Sovietsthroughout the whole of Siberia. 
 What can take the placeof the Soviet Power? The only power that can take its place is a bourgeois government. 
 But the bourgeoisie in Russia has proved clearly enough that it can only remain in power with foreign help. 
 If a bourgeois government, supported by outside help,should establish itself in power in Siberia, and EasternRussia become lost to the Soviet, then in Western Russiathe Soviet Power would become weakened to such an extentthat it could hardly hold out for long; it would be followed by a bourgeois government, which would also need foreign help. 
 The Power to give this help would, of course, not beEngland. 
 It is easy to understand what avenues are openedup by this possibility. 
 I confirm that I really said this in a conversation with Ransome, and I give permission for it to be printed.

 Add* Written Marc h 23, 1918 First publishe d in 1933 Printe d from the manuscript in Leni n Miscellany XXI ORIGINAL VERSIO N OF THE ARTICLE “THE IMMEDIAT E TASKS OF THE SOVIE T GOVERNMEN T”61 CHAPTER IV ...** Today this task—which is, of course, not yet sufficiently completed and can never be fully accomplished—no longer stands first among the tasks facing the Soviet government. 
The recent congresses of the Soviets, notably the All -Russia Congress held in Moscow, have shown that the overwhelmingmajority of the labouring classes have firmly and consciously sided with the Soviet power in general and with the Bolshevik Party in particular. 
 It goes without saying that for anygovernment that is at all democratic the task of convincingthe masses can never be wholly overshadowed—on thecontrary, it will always be among the important tasks ofgovernment. 
 As a key issue, however, it will only have significance for parties of the opposition or for parties that *Here the manuscript breaks off.

 are fighting for ideals of the future. 
 After the Bolsheviks, first under tsarism and then under Kerensky, had succeeded in winning over to their side the majority of the class -con-scious active elements of the working masses, our Party was faced with the task of conquering power and suppressing theresistance of the exploiters. 
 The task that came to the forewas that of winning, instead of convincing, Russia. 
 Fromthe end of October 1917 approximately up to February 1918 the militant or military task held first place, as it naturally should for any political party making a bid for power inconditions of sharp and extremely bitter struggle. 
 Obviously,for the Party of the proletariat, the task of suppressing theresistance of the exploiters becomes a crucial issue, becausethe working masses who side with the proletariat are opposed here by the united members of the propertied classes armed both with the power of capital, the power of knowledge andthe long -standing, if not age -old, habit and practice of government. 
 Owing to the special conditions that werecreated in Russia under the influence of the unforgottenlessons of the revolution of 1905 and the influence of the far more painful and harsher lessons of the present war—owing to these conditions the Bolsheviks succeeded with compara -tive ease in solving the problem of winning power both in thecapital and in the chief industrial centres of Russia. 
 But inthe provinces, in places far removed from the centre, andespecially in districts known to have the greatest concentra -tion of a comparatively backward population rooted in thetraditions of the monarchy and medievalism—the Cossackregions, for instance—Soviet power had to contend witha resistance that took on military forms and is only now,more than four months after the October Revolution, comingto an end. 
 At the present time the task of overcoming and suppressing the resistance of the exploiters in Russia is, in the main, completed. 
 Russia has been won by theBolsheviks chiefly because—as that prominent leader ofthe counter -revolutionary Don Cossacks, Bogayevsky himself, recently admitted—the overwhelming majority of the peopleeven among the Cossacks have consciously, firmly and definitely sided with the Bolsheviks. 
 But the special conditions in which the propertied classes are placedeconomically enable them naturally to organise not only passive resistance (sabotage), but to repeat the attempt at military resistance to Soviet power. 
 For that reason the task of suppressing the resistance of the exploiters cannot be regarded as having been finally completed. 
 At any rate,it has now obviously been dealt with in its main aspects andis retreating into the background. 
 The Soviet governmentwill never for a moment allow itself to forget about this taskand will under no circumstances let itself be diverted from it by any political or so -called socialist names or decla -mations. 
 We have to speak about this because both the Men -sheviks and the Right S. 
R. 
s act as the most mobile, some -times even as the most brazen -faced counter -revolutionaries, who wage a sharper struggle against the Soviet governmentthan the one they had allowed themselves to wage against the reactionary and landowner governments, and rely on their party’s label and designation to protect them. 
 Natural -ly, the Soviet government will never falter in its task ofsuppressing the resistance of the exploiters, no matter whatparty banners or what popular and specious names thisresistance may be covered up with. 
 However, at the present time the task of suppressing resistance has, in the main, been completed, and the task now confronting us is that ofadministering the state. 
 This transition from what was once the priority task of convincing the masses, a transition from the task of winningpower and crushing the resistance of the exploiters by military force to what is now the primary task of administer -ing the state—this transition is the main feature of the present moment. 
 The difficulty which the Soviet governmentis experiencing is that of bringing home the essentials ofthis transition to all the class -conscious elements of the working masses as well as the people’s political leaders. 
 For it is self -understood that the transition to the peaceful tasks of governing the whole population irrespective ofclasses, a transition that is taking place in conditions whenthe civil war is still going on in some places, when gravemilitary dangers are threatening the Soviet Republic fromboth the West and the East, and when the war has caused untold havoc throughout the country—it is self -understood that such a transition is beset with tremendous difficul -ties. 
 /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR CHAPTER V The task of administering the state, which now confronts the Soviet government, has this special feature, that,probably for the first time in the modern history of civilisednations, it deals pre -eminently with economics rather than with politics. 
 Usually the word “administration” is associatedchiefly, if not solely, with political activity. 
 However, the very basis and essence of Soviet power, like that of the transition itself from capitalist to socialist society, liein the fact that political tasks occupy a subordinate positionto economic tasks. 
 And now, especially after the practicalexperience of over four months of Soviet government inRussia, it should be quite clear to us that the task of administering the state is primarily a purely economic task—that of healing the country’s wounds inflicted by thewar, restoring its productive forces, organising accountancyin and control over production and distribution, raisingthe productivity of labour—in short, it boils down to thetask of economic reorganisation. 
 This task can be said to fall under two main headings: 1) accounting and control over production and distributionin the broadest, most widespread and universal forms of suchaccounting and control, and 2) raising the productivity oflabour. 
 These tasks can be handled by any form of collectiveeffort or any form of state passing over to socialism only on condition that the basic economic, social, cultural and political preconditions for this have been created in a suf -ficient degree by capitalism. 
 Without large -scale machine production, without a more or less developed network ofrailways, postal and telegraph communications, withouta more or less developed network of public educational institutions, neither of these tasks can be carried out in a systematic way on a national scale. 
 Russia is in a positionwhen quite a number of these initial preconditions for sucha transition actually exist. 
 On the other hand, quite a numberof these preconditions are absent in our country, but can beborrowed by it fairly easily from the experience of the neighbouring, far more advanced countries, whom history and international intercourse have long since placed inclose contact with Russia. 
 CHAPTER VI The basic aim of every society going over to a socialist system consists in the victory of the ruling class—or ratherthe class that is growing up to be the ruling class—namely,the proletariat, over the bourgeoisie as described above. 
And this task is set before us in a substantially new way,quite unlike the way it stood in the course of many decades of the proletariat’s world -wide experience of struggle against the bourgeoisie. 
 Now, after the gains of the October Revolu -tion, after our successes in the civil war, victory over thebourgeoisie should stand for something much bigger, albeitmore peaceful in form: namely, victory over the bourgeoisie,now that it has been secured politically and made good militarily, should now be achieved in the sphere of organisa -tion of the national economy, in the sphere of organisation of production, in the sphere of country -wide accounting and control. 
 The problem of accounting and control over produc -tion was dealt with by the bourgeoisie all the more effectivelyin proportion as production expanded and the network of national economic institutions embracing tens and hundreds of millions of the population of a large modern state becamemore ramified. 
 We must handle this task now in a new way,backed by the predominating position of the proletariat,supported by the bulk of the working and exploited masses,making use of those elements of organising talent and techni -cal knowledge which have been accumulated by the precedingsociety, and nine -tenths, perhaps even ninety -nine hundredths of which belong to a class hostile and opposed to thesocialist revolution. 
 CHAPTER VII German imperialism, which has made the greatest advance not only in military power and military techniques, but inbig industrial organisations within the framework of capitalism, has incidentally given proof of its economic progressiveness by bring the first country to introduce labourconscription. 
 Naturally, in the conditions of capitalist society in general and particularly when the monarchist states are waging an imperialist war, labour conscription is nothing more than a military convict prison for the workers, a new means of enslaving the working and exploited masses,a new system of measures for suppressing all protest on’ thepart of these masses. 
 Nevertheless, there is no question thatit is only because of the economic preconditions created bybig capitalism that such a reform could be put forward and effected. 
 And now we, amid conditions of appalling post -war economic disorganisation, are obliged to consider the urgencyof a similar reform. 
 Naturally, Soviet power, which ispassing from a capitalist to a socialist organisation ofsociety, must tackle this problem of labour conscriptionfrom the other end, opposite to that of German imperialism. 
 For the capitalists and imperialists of Germany labour conscription meant enslavement of the workers. 
 For theworkers and peasant poor in Russia labour conscriptionshould mean, first and foremost, recruitment of the rich andpropertied classes for the discharge of their social duties. 
We should start labour conscription with the rich. 
 This is necessitated, generally speaking, not only by the fact that the Soviet Republic is a socialist republic. 
 Thenecessity arises also from the fact that it was precisely thewealthy and propertied classes who, by their resistance, bothmilitary and passive (sabotage), mostly prevented Russia fromhealing the wounds inflicted upon her by the war, hampered the country’s economic rehabilitation and progress. 
 That is why accounting and control, which should be now considereda problem of paramount importance in the whole businessof state administration, must be applied first of all to thewealthy and propertied classes. 
 It was the members of theseclasses who enjoyed the tribute they collected from the working people, especially during the war; it was they who used this tribute to evade a task which is the duty of everycitizen, namely, that of lending a hand in healing the country’swounds and putting it on its feet again; it was they whoused the plundered tribute to retire and entrench themselvesbehind impregnable walls and offer every possible resistance to the victory of the socialist principle over the capitalist principle of society’s organisation. 
 One of the chief weaponsof such struggle against the Soviets and against socialism on the part of the wealthy and propertied classes was their possession of considerable hoards of currency notes. 
 The propertied classes in capitalist society derived most of their wealth from the land and other means of production, suchas factories, mills, etc. 
, which they owned. 
 The Sovietgovernment had no difficulty, thanks to the support of theworkers and the great majority of the peasants, in abolishingthe right of the landowners and the bourgeoisie to these basic items of the country’s wealth. 
 It was not difficult to decree the abolition of private property in land. 
 It wasnot difficult to nationalise most of the factories and mills. 
There is no doubt that the nationalisation of other bigindustrial enterprises and transport facilities is a problemthat will easily be dealt with in the very near future. 
 Capitalist society, however, has created another form of wealth, which is by no means so easy for the Soviet govern -ment to deal with. 
 This is wealth in the form of money, orrather, currency notes. 
 Currency notes during the war wereissued in very great numbers. 
 Russia was cut off by a wallof military operations from commerce with a number of countries who had been her largest importers and exporters. 
 The amassment of currency notes in the hands of the wealthyand propertied classes, practically all of whom, directlyor indirectly, had speculated on the high prices for militarycontracts and supplies, is one of the chief means by whichthe propertied classes amassed wealth and accumulated power over the working people. 
 Today the economic position of Russia, as probably of every capitalist country that hasgone through three years of war, is characterised by the factthat enormous amounts of paper money are concentrated inthe hands of and hoarded by a comparatively small minority,the bourgeoisie and propertied classes, and this paper money, though greatly depreciated through massive emission, still represents a claim to levy tribute on the workingpopulation. 
 During the transition from capitalist to socialist society it is absolutely impossible to do without currency notesor to replace them with new ones in a short space of time. 
 The Soviet government is now confronted with a difficult task, which nevertheless has to be dealt with at all costs—thetask of combating the resistance of the wealthy, a resistance that takes the form of hoarding and concealing the proofs of their claim to levy tribute on the working people. 
 These proofs are currency notes. 
 Naturally, while these currency notes previously gave the right to acquire and purchase themeans of production, such as land, factories, mills, etc. 
, theirsignificance today has diminished and even been reducedto naught. 
 The purchase of land has become impossible inRussia after promulgation of the law on the socialisation of the land, while the purchase of factories and mills and similar large -scale means of production and transport has become practically impossible owing to the rapid process ofnationalisation and confiscation of all such large enterprises. 
And so, it becomes more and more difficult and almostimpossible for members of the bourgeoisie and propertied classes (including the peasant bourgeoisie) to acquire money for the purchase of the means of production. 
 But in defendingtheir old privileges and trying to retard and obstruct as muchas they can the business of socialist reforms within thecountry, the bourgeoisie are hoarding and concealing theproofs of their claim to a share in the social wealth, their claim to levy tribute on the working people, hoarding and concealing currency notes in order to have a chance, howeverslender, of maintaining their position and recovering theirold privileges in the event of difficulties or crises of a militaryor commercial nature that might yet beset Russia. 
 As regards consumer goods, the possibility of buying them with the sums of paper money they have accumulated through speculations during the war remains almost fully with thebourgeoisie and propertied classes, since the problem ofproper rationing and distribution of these goods in a countrylike Russia, with her huge population of small peasants,petty artisans or handicraftsmen, presents tremendous difficulties, and in the prevailing state of economic chaos caused by the war this problem still remains practicallyunsolved. 
 Thus, the Soviet government is obliged to startthe business of accounting and control over production anddistribution by an organised struggle against the wealthyand propertied classes who are hoarding vast sums in currency notes and evading state control. 
 It is estimated that currency notes to the value of about thirty thousand million rubles have been issued in Russia to date. 
 Of this sum probably no less than twenty thousand million, or maybe considerably more, are excess hoards unneeded for trade turnover, which are kept hidden away by members of the bourgeoisie and propertied classes for motivesof self -interest—or class self -interest. 
 The Soviet government will have to combine the introduc -tion of labour conscription with the registration, in the firstplace, of people belonging to the bourgeoisie and propertied classes; it will have to demand truthful statements (declara -tions) concerning the amount of currency notes available; it will have to take a number of measures to make sure thatthis demand will not remain on paper; it will have to considertransitional measures for concentrating all stocks of currencynotes in the State Bank or its branches. 
 Unless these measures are taken, the business of accounting and control over production and distribution cannot be effectivelycarried through. 
 CHAPTER VIII The introduction of labour conscription, however, cannot be confined to accounting and control over the sums ofcurrency notes concentrated in the hands of the propertiedclasses. 
 The Soviet government will have to apply theprinciples of labour conscription also to the direct activitiesof the bourgeoisie and propertied classes in the sphere of factory management and the servicing of enterprises by all kinds of subsidiary labour such as book -keeping, accountancy, clerical work, technical, administrative and other jobs. 
In this respect, too, the task of the Soviet government is nowshifting from the sphere of direct struggle against sabotageto the sphere of business organisation in the new conditions, since after the victories won by the Soviets in the civil war, beginning with October and ending February, a breach hasvirtually been made in the passive forms of resistance,namely, in the sabotage by the bourgeoisie and the bourgeoisintellectuals. 
 It is no accident that at the present timewe are witnessing a sweeping, one might say widespread, change of sentiment and political behaviour in the camp of the former saboteurs, i. 
e. 
, the capitalists and bourgeoisintellectuals. 
 In all spheres of economic and political life we now find a great number of bourgeois intellectuals and capitalist businessmen offering their services to the Soviet power. 
 And it is up to the Soviet power now to make use of these services, which are definitely necessary for the transi -tion to socialism, especially in a peasant country like Russia,and should be utilised on condition that the Sovietgovernment has complete ascendancy, direction and controlover its new assistants and co -operators (who had often acted in defiance of this same Soviet power in the secret hope of protesting it). 
 To show how necessary it is for the Soviet government to make use of the services of bourgeois intellectuals forthe transition to socialism, we venture to use an expressionthat may at first glance seem paradoxical: we must to a considerable extent, take a lesson in socialism from the trust managers, we must take a lesson in socialism fromcapitalism’s big organisers. 
 That this is no paradox anyonecan easily see who realises that it is the big factories, bigmachine industry, which developed exploitation of theworking people to an unheard -of degree, that it is precisely the big factories that are the centres of concentration of that class which alone has been able to destroy the rule of capitaland begin the transition to socialism. 
 It is not surprising,therefore, that in order to solve the practical problems ofsocialism, when the organisational aspects of it are pushedto the fore, we must enlist to the service of the Soviet power a great number of bourgeois intellectuals, especially from among those who were engaged in the practical work oforganising large -scale capitalist production, that is to say, first and foremost, those engaged in organising syndicates,cartels and trusts. 
 Tackling this problem will require of theSoviet government an exertion of energy and initiative by the working masses in all fields of the national economy, since the old position held by the so -called captains of industry—the old position of the masters and exploiters—this old position the Soviet government will never let themhave. 
 The former captains of industry, the former mastersand exploiters, must be employed as technical experts, managers, consultants, advisers. 
 A new, difficult, but extremely gratifying problem must be solved, that ofcombining all the experience and knowledge which these members of the exploiting classes have accumulated, with the initiative, energy and work of the broad masses of the working people. 
 For only by this combination is it possible to build the bridge leading from the old capitalist to the newsocialist society. 
 If the socialist revolution had won simultaneously throughout the world or, at least, in a number of advancedcountries, then the task of enlisting the services of the best technician specialists from among the leaders of old capita -lism to the process of the new organisation of production would have been made considerably easier. 
 BackwardRussia would not have to wrestle with this problem on herown, as the advanced workers of the West -European countries would have come to her help and relieved her of most of the complexities involved in that most difficult of all tasks arising in the period of transition to socialismknown as the organisational task. 
 In the present situation,when the socialist revolution in the West is slow and latein coming, and Russia has to speed up measures for herreorganisation, if only in order to save the population from starvation and afterwards the whole country from a possible foreign military invasion—in the present situation we haveto borrow from the advanced countries, not their help insocialist organisation and the support of the workers, butthe help of their bourgeoisie and capitalist intellectuals. 
 Things have so shaped themselves that we are able to get this help by organising the assistance of the bourgeois intellectuals in solving the new organisational problems ofthe Soviet power. 
 This assistance can be secured by payinghigh salaries to the best specialists in every field of know -ledge, both to the citizens of this country and to those invitedfrom abroad. 
 Naturally, in a developed socialist society it would appear quite unfair and incorrect for members of the bourgeois intelligentsia to receive considerably higherpay than that received by the best sections of the workingclass. 
 Under the conditions of practical reality, however... * we must solve this pressing problem by means of this (unfair)remuneration for bourgeois specialists at much higher rates. 
 *Part of the sentence illegible and has been omitted. 
— Ed. 
 If, for example, we found that in order to organise production in Russia on new lines, in order to raise the productivity of labour and train our people in the art of working in better conditions—if we had to employ for this purpose, say twothousand big specialists in different fields of knowledge,specialists from among Russian and still more from amongforeign, let us say, American sources—if we had to pay themfifty or a hundred million rubles a year, such an expense, from the point of view of the interests of the national econo -my, and generally from the point of view of abandoning out-worn methods of production for newer and more up -to-date methods, would be fully warranted. 
 Such a sum is worthpaying to have our people trained in better methods andtechniques of production, and we shall have to pay it because, short of the victory of the socialist revolution in other countries, there is no other possibility of getting thisleadership. 
 Of course, employment of the labour and guidance of the bourgeois intellectuals in combination with proper controlby the democratic organisations of the working people and the Soviets, will create a number of new problems, but these problems will be quite solvable. 
 No difficulties can stop usfrom solving these problems, as we have no other way outtowards a higher organisation of production under thepresent situation. 
 I shall go further. 
 Big capitalism has created systems of work organisation, which, under the prevailing conditions of exploitation of the masses, represent the harshest formof enslavement by which the minority, the propertied classes,wring out of the working people surplus amounts of labour,strength, blood and nerves. 
 At the same time they are thelast word in the scientific organisation of production, and as such, have to be adopted by the Socialist Soviet Republic and readjusted to serve the interests of our accounting andcontrol over production on the one hand, and raising theproductivity of labour, on the other. 
 For instance, thefamous Taylor system, which is so widespread in America,is famous precisely because it is the last word in reckless capitalist exploitation. 
 One can understand why this system met with such an intense hatred and protest on the part ofthe workers. 
 At the same time, we must not for a moment forget that the Taylor system represents the tremendous progress of science, which systematically analyses the process of production and points the way towards an immense increase in the efficiency of human labour. 
 The scientificresearches which the introduction of the Taylor system startedin America, notably that of motion study, as the Americanscall it, yielded important data allowing the working popula -tion to be trained in incomparably higher methods of labour in general and of work organisation in particular. 
 The negative aspect of Taylorism was that it was applied in conditions of capitalist slavery and served as a means ofsqueezing double and triple the amount of labour out of theworkers at the old rates of pay regardless of whether thehired workers were capable of giving this double and triple amount of labour in the same number of working hours without detriment to the human organism. 
 The SocialistSoviet Republic is faced with a task which can be brieflyformulated thus: we must introduce the Taylor system andscientific American efficiency of labour throughout Russiaby combining this system with a reduction in working time, with the application of new methods of production and work organisation undetrimental to the labour power of theworking population. 
 On the contrary, the Taylor system,properly controlled and intelligently applied by the workingpeople themselves, will serve as a reliable means of furthergreatly reducing the obligatory working day for the entire working population, will serve as an effective means of dealing, in a fairly short space of time, with a task thatcould roughly be expressed as follows: six hours of physicalwork daily for every adult citizen and four hours of workin running the state. 
 The adoption of such a system would call for very many new skills and new organisational bodies. 
 Without doubt, this will create for us many difficulties, and the posing ofsuch a task will even evoke perplexity if not resistanceamong certain sections of the working people themselves. 
We may be sure, however, that the progressive elementsamong the working class will understand the need for such a transition, and that the appalling extent of the economic chaos witnessed in the towns and villages by millions of menreturning from the front who had been torn away from it all and now saw the full extent of the ravages caused by the war—all this, without doubt, has prepared the ground for shaping public opinion in this direction, and we may be sure that the transition which we have roughly outlinedabove will be accepted as a practical task by all elementsamong the working classes who have now consciously sidedwith the Soviet government. 
 CHAPTER IX An economic transition of the above nature calls also for a corresponding change in the functions of Sovietleadership. 
 It is quite natural, in a situation under which the main task was to convince the majority of the nation or to win power and crush the resistance of the exploiters,that among the leaders, too, those who came to the foreshould have been agitators in regard to the masses, withwhom Soviet power was more closely connected than anyother democratic form of government in the past. 
 Naturally, winning over the majority of the population or drawing it into a hard and difficult armed struggle against the exploiterscalled above all for agitators of ability. 
 Conversely, the tasksoutlined above and aimed at establishing accounting andcontrol over production and distribution, advance to thefore practical managers and organisers. 
 Accordingly, a certain reappraisal of leaders, certain shifts among them, should be effected in cases where they are unable to adapt themselvesto the new conditions and the new task. 
 Naturally, theleadership of a past period accustomed chiefly to agitators’tasks, would find such a transition very difficult. 
 Naturally,a number of mistakes because of this was unavoidable. 
 Both the leaders and the Soviet electorate at large, that is, the working and exploited masses, must now be made to see thenecessity for this change. 
 Among the working and exploited masses there is far more talent and ability as organisers than as agitators, forthe entire work milieu of these classes demanded of them to a much greater extent the ability to organise joint work and a system of accounting and control over production anddistribution. 
 Their former conditions of life, on the contrary, provided far less grounds for advancing from their midst leaders possessing the gift of agitators or propagandists. 
 Perhaps that is why we so often see now agitators and propagandists by vocation or calling who are compelled toassume the tasks of organisers, and who have it broughthome to them at every step that they are not quite fit forthe job and that the workers and peasants are disappointedand dissatisfied with them. 
 These mistakes and failures of the Soviet government often provoke malicious glee among classes that are hostile to the idea of a socialist remodellingof society, among members of the bourgeois parties or thosewho call themselves socialist parties but who actually servethe bourgeoisie with zeal—people like the Mensheviks andthe Right Socialist -Revolutionaries. 
 Clear as the historical inevitability of these mistakes is, it is equally clear that the shortcomings in this respect are merely the growing painsof the new socialist society. 
 There can be no doubt that therepresentatives of Soviet power all over Russia can and willrequalify without great difficulty, that the practical agitatorswill learn to occupy a befitting leading place. 
 This, however, will take time, and only practical experience by trial and error is capable of bringing a clear realisation of the need forchange, capable of bringing to the fore a number of people,or even a whole cross -section, fit to deal with the new tasks. 
 There is probably more organising talent among the workersand peasants than the bourgeoisie imagine. 
 The trouble is that these talents have no chance to develop, make good and win a place for themselves in the conditions of capitalisteconomy. 
 On the other hand, if we clearly recognise today the need for enlisting new organising talent on a broad scale to thebusiness of running the state, if we—guided by the principles of Soviet power—start systematically promoting to leading positions people who have practical experience in this busi -ness, we shall succeed in a short time in building up a newstratum of practical organisers of production, who, on thebasis of the principles evolved by Soviet power, principlescast among the masses and carried into practice by the masses under the control of Soviet bodies representing the mass membership, will win a position for themselves befittingtheir role of leadership. 
 CHAPTER X Soviet government will have to pass over, or rather it will simultaneously have to deal with, the problem of applyingcorresponding principles to the bulk of the workers andpeasants. 
 Here the task of introducing labour conscriptionpresents its other side to us. 
 We must approach this problemdifferently and highlight different things to those that have to be applied in the case of the wealthy classes. 
 We see no essential need for registering all the working people, forkeeping an eye on their stocks of currency notes or theirconsumption, since all the conditions of life compel thevast majority of these sections of the population to work fortheir living and give them no chance to hoard anything but the most meagre stocks. 
 Therefore, the task of introducing labour conscription in this field resolves itself into the taskof establishing labour discipline and self -discipline. 
 In the old capitalist society discipline over the working people was enforced by capital through the constant threatof starvation. 
 This threat being combined with excessively heavy toil and the workers’ awareness that they were working, not for themselves, but for somebody else’s benefit,the conditions of labour became a constant struggle of thegreat majority of the working people against the organisersof production. 
 This inevitably created a psychology in whichpublic opinion among the working people not only did not frown on poor work or shirkers, but, on the contrary, saw in this an inevitable and legitimate protest against or meansof resistance to the excessive demands of the exploiters. 
If the bourgeois press and its echoers are now shouting somuch about anarchy among the workers, about their lack ofdiscipline and excessive demands, the vicious nature of this criticism is so obvious that it is not worth dwelling on. 
 It is only natural that in a country like Russia, where the bulkof the population for the last three years has endured suchappalling hunger and privations, there should have beena number of cases of utter despondency and a break -down of organisation. 
 To demand a quick change in this connection or to expect such changes to be achieved by several decrees, would be as absurd as resorting to appeals in an attempt torestore good cheer and energy into a man who had been beaten within an inch of his life. 
 Only the Soviet government, created by the working people themselves, and taking into consideration the growing signs of recovery among them, is in a position to carry out radical changes in this respect. 
 The need for working out systematic measures to improve self-discipline among the working people has now been fully brought home to the representatives of Soviet power and itssupporters—the political -minded trade union leaders, for instance. 
 There is no doubt that in the environment of capitalist society in general, and still more, in theatmosphere of frenzied, unbridled speculation created bythe war, there has seeped in among the working class anelement of demoralisation that will seriously need copingwith. 
 All the more that, owing to the war, the composition of the working -class vanguard itself has not changed for the better either. 
 Therefore, the maintenance of discipline amongthe working people, the organisation of control over themeasure of labour and the intensity of labour, the introduc -tion of special industrial courts for establishing the measureof labour, for prosecuting those guilty of flagrant violations of this measure, and for exercising systematic influence on the majority with the object of raising this measure—all thishas now been brought to the fore as one of the most urgenttasks of the Soviet government. 
 The only thing is to bear in mind that in bourgeois society one of the principal instruments of social education, namely, the press, completely failed to discharge its task in this respect. 
 And to this day our Soviet press, too, is still largelyunder the influence of the old habits and old traditionsof bourgeois society. 
 This is evidenced, among other things,by the fact that our press, like the old bourgeois press, con -tinues to devote too much space and attention to political trivia, to those personal questions of political leadership by which the capitalists of all countries have striven todraw the attention of the masses away from the reallyimportant, profound and cardinal questions of their life.

E. 
C. 
 APRIL 1, 1918 The question under discussion is a draft resolution concerning labour discipline drawn up by the All -Russia Council of Trade Unions. 
 Comrade Lenin moves a number of amendments and more definite wordings of differentpoints in the draft, which he suggests should be concretised. 
Piece wages should be fixed for all industries withoutexception, and in the case of trades where that is not possible,a system of bonuses should be introduced. 
 To keep account of productivity and maintain discipline it is necessary to set up industrial courts, to form groups of controllers ofvarious trades, not at the enterprise, but from outside, and enlisting the co-operation of engineers, book-keepers and peasants. 
 The decree should definitely provide for the introduction of the Taylor system, in other words, every use should be made of the scientific methods of work suggested by this system. 
 Without it, productivity cannot be raised, without it we shall not be able to introduce socialism. 
 In the application of this system American engineers are to be enlisted. 
 Naturally, in introducing it, due consideration should be given to the poor nutrition. 
 The rates of output, therefore, should make allowance for a low diet. 
 Furthe r-more, it is necessary to organise output. 
. 
 . 
* in the transition to socialism may enable us to reduce the working day. 
 The decree should mention accountancy and the printing of reports concerning the productivity of the various ente r-prises. 
 As to penal measures for breaches of labour discipline, these are to be stricter. 
 Punishment should go to the length of imprisonment. 
 Dismissal, too, may be applied, but this will be of an entirely different nature. 
 Under the capitalist system dismissal was a breach of a civic agreement. 
 Now, a breach of discipline, especially with the introduction of compulsory labour service, will be a criminal offence subject to a definite punishment.

 To hoard surpluses of grain and other food products at a time when the people in Petrograd, in Moscow, and indozens of non -agricultural uyezds are not only suffering from a shortage of bread, but are cruelly starving, is anenormous crime deserving the most ruthless punishment. 
 2. 
 The task of fighting famine does not only consist in pumping grain out of the grain -producing areas, but in having all grain surpluses, as well as all foodstuffs in general, delivered to and collected by the state. 
 Unlessthis is done, there can be no question of any socialist reformsor of our being able to wage an effective defensive war.

 Written June 15, 1918 First published in 1933 Printed from the manuscript in Lenin Miscellany XXI THE DEMOCRATISM AND SOCIALIST NATURE OF SOVIET POWER The democratism of Soviet power and its socialist nature are expressed in the fact that the supreme state authority is vested in the Soviets, which are made up of representatives of the working people(workers, soldiers and peasants), freely elected andremovable at any time by the masses hitherto oppressedby capital; that the local Soviets freely amalgamate on a basis of democratic centralism into a single federal union as represented by the Soviet state power of the RussianSoviet Republic; that the Soviets concentrate in their hands not only the legislative power and supervision of law enforcement,but direct enforcement of the laws through all the members of the Soviets with a view to a gradual transition to the performance of legislative functions and state administrationby the whole working population. 
 Taking, further, into consideration,that any direct or indirect legalisation of the rights of ownership of the workers of any given factory or any given trade on their particular production, or of their right to weaken or impede the orders of the state authority, is a flagrant distortion of the basic principles of Soviet power and a complete rejection of socialism....

 112 INTERVIEW GIVEN TO THE CORRESPONDENT OF FOLKETS DAGBLAD POLITIKEN JULY 1, 191887 Your correspondent talked today with Lenin concerning the situation in Russia and the general situation in Europe. 
 Lenin emphasised that a revolution is always born in travail. 
 A country making a revolution on its own will always finditself in a serious position. 
 But the situation is difficulteverywhere, not only in Russia. 
 There is said to be anarchyin Russia, but that is the fruit of four years of war, andnot of the Bolshevik regime. 
 The few remaining weeks until the new harvest will be the most difficult. 
 The harvest promises to be a good one. 
 The counter -revolution is trying its hardest to take advantage of the present situation. 
 Thecounter -revolution consists of rich peasants and officers, but without foreign support they are powerless. 
 In thetowns where the counter -revolutionaries had won, they remained in power only a few days, if not a few hours. 
The assassination of Volodarsky, organised by the RightSocialist -Revolutionaries, really reveals the weakness of the counter -revolutionaries. 
 The history of the Russian revolution shows that a party always resorts to individualterror when it does not enjoy the support of the masses. 
 * * * Opposition within the Bolshevik Party against the peace of Brest has subsided, says Lenin. 
 Bukharin, Radek and therest are taking part in the work again. 
 Peace is necessary *Here the manuscript breaks off. 
— Ed. 
 in order to prevent the Germans from seizing the whole of Russia and strangling the revolution. 
 As regards the measures taken against the anarchists, these are due to the fact that the anarchists had been arming and some of themhad been joining up with patently bandit elements. 
 Theanarchists who are dedicated to an ideal have already beenreleased and their big daily Anarkhia is coming out as usual. 
 88 Amid all these difficulties, industry is being organised. 
 The owners of the enterprises are still sabotaging on a broadscale, but the workers are taking the management of theenterprises into their own hands. 
 Referring to the Czechoslovak revolt, Lenin expressed confidence that it would be suppressed by the Soviet troops, although it was dragging out. 
 * * * The Germans in the Ukraine are in a very difficult plight. 
 They are receiving no grain whatever from the peasants. 
 The peasants are arming and attacking the German soldiers in large groups wherever they are met with. 
 This movementis spreading. 
 Owing to the German occupation Bolshevismin the Ukraine has become a sort of national movement. 
It is rallying around it people who would not hear ofBolshevism before that. 
 If the Germans occupied Russia, the result would be the same. 
 The Germans need peace. 
 It is significant that in the Ukraine the Germans want peacemore than the Ukrainians themselves do. 
 The same appliesto Turkey. 
 The Germans have concluded an advantageousagreement with the Ukrainian Rada despite the fact thatpeople in the Ukraine have always criticised the peace of Brest. 
 Now the Germans are helping to fight the Bolsheviks in the Caucasus. 
 * * * We in Russia now have to wait for the revolutionary movement to develop in Europe. 
 The war party in Germany today is so strong that it speaks with contempt of the government in Berlin. 
 Resistance to imperialism, however,is growing even in bourgeois circles. 
 Sooner or later things everywhere will lead to political and social collapse. 
 The present situation is unstable, but a better order of things cannot be created merely with the aid of war and bloodshed.

 The “Internationale ” was sung . 
) In his speech Lenin, in a clear and popular form, explained the essential features and basic points of the Soviet Constitution. 
 The Sovietswere the highest form of democratic government by thepeople. 
 The Soviets were not something invented out of one’s head, they were the product of living reality. 
 They *Meaning Article 416. 
— Ed. 
 appeared and developed for the first time in history in our backward country, but objectively they should become the form of government by the working people all over the world. 
 All constitutions that had existed till now safeguarded the interests of the ruling classes. 
 The Soviet Constitutionwas the only one that served and would constantly servethe working people and was a powerful weapon in the fight for socialism. 
 Comrade Lenin very aptly pointed out the differences between the demands for “freedom of the pressand assembly” in bourgeois constitutions and in the SovietConstitution. 
 There, freedom of the press and assembly wasan exclusive monopoly of the bourgeoisie; there thebourgeoisie met in their saloons, issued their big dailies financed by the banks with the aim of sowing lies and slander and poisoning the minds of the masses; there theworkers’ press was strangled, not allowed to say what itthought about the predatory war; there, those opposedto the war were hounded and their meetings banned. 
 Herein Soviet Russia, however, the workers’ press existed and served the working people. 
 In Russia we were taking the sumptuous houses and palaces away from the bourgeoisieand turning them over to the workers to be used by them asclubs, and that was freedom of assembly in practice. 
 Religionwas a private concern. 
 Everyone could believe in what hewants or believe in nothing. 
 The Soviet Republic united the working people of all nations and defended the interests of the working people without national discrimination. 
 TheSoviet Republic knew no religious distinctions. 
 It stoodabove all religion and strove to separate religion from theSoviet state. 
 Lenin went on to describe the Soviet Republic’sdifficult position, surrounded as it was on all sides by imperialist predators. 
 Comrade Lenin expressed his confi -dence that the Red Army men would defend our Soviet Republic with all their might against all encroachmentsby international imperialism and would keep it safe untilour ally—the international proletariat—came to our aid.

 CHICHERI N120 Comrade Chicherin, We must urgently (to be endorsed in the C. 
C. 
 before departure of the Spartacist121) prepare an international socialist conference for founding the Third International. 
 (in Berlin (openly) or in Holland (secretly ), say, for 1. 
II. 
1919 ) generally very soon For this we must (a) formulate platform principles (I think we could (α) take the theory and practice of Bolshevism —have Bukharin set this forth in theses, as briefly as possible. 
2) “Barter” control of produce shipped and delivered to consumer. 
 3) Personal responsibility of former capitalists or former owners of the enterprises inall boards and centres (underthreat of imprisonment, execu -tion of former capitalists, ar -rest of their families). 
119 4) Instruct the Food Commissa -riat, in the field of distribution,which is the weakest field, to givedefinite practical assignments to the union of Commercial and Industrial Employees underthe collective responsibility ofthe whole union. 
 ||| ||| Talk it over with Bukharin—perhaps take part of them from my draft programme * (β) then take “ Was will der Spartacusbund <”). 
 α & β give sufficiently clear platform principles ; (b) define the basis (organisational) of the Third Inter -national (nothing in common with the social -patriots); (c) give a list of parties, roughly under three headings αα) parties and groups we have good reason to consider as already sharing the platform of the Third Inter -national and as being sufficiently unanimous on the question of formally founding the Third International: ββ) parties close to this, from whom we expect alignment and affiliation; γγ)groups and currents within the social -patriotic parties more or less close to Bolshevism . 
 I am offering’ a tentative list (p. 
 4) **; additions should be made with care . 
 Who are we inviting to our conference? Only αα&ββ &γγ and only those (1) who resolutely stand for a break with the social -patriots (i. 
e. 
, the people who, directly or indirectly, supported the bourgeois governments during the imperialist war of 1914 -18); 2) who are for a socialist revolution now and for the dictatorship of the proletariat; 3) who are in principle for “Soviet power” and against limitation of our work by bourgeois parliamentarism, against subordination to it, and who recognise the fact that the Soviet type of government is higher and closer to socialism . 
 Perhaps we should add that we do not suggest that the whole of the Third International immediately start calling itself “communist”, but we do place on the order of the day (for discussion ) the question of resolutely rejecting the names of “Social -Democratic” and “socialist” parties, and adopting that of “communist” parties.

 Written Februar y 19, 1919 Firs t published in 1933 Printe d from the manuscript in Leni n Miscellany XXIV ON THE APPEAL OF THE GERMA N INDEPENDENT S129 We seldom have a chance now of receiving foreign newspapers in Russia: the blockade with which the “demo -cratic capitalists” of the Entente have surrounded us is apparently operating effectively. 
 They are afraid to acquaintthe educated workers of America, Britain and France withignorant and uncivilised Bolshevism, they are afraid lestpeople in this land of uncivilised Bolshevism get to know of its successes in the West. 
 But despite the zealous efforts of the gendarmery of the new Holy Alliance to suppress it, the truth will out! The other day I happened to see several numbers of the Berlin newspaper Die Freiheit , the organ of the so -called “independent” German Social -Democrats. 
 The front page of No. 
 74 (for 11. 
II. 
1919) carried a lengthy appeal “To the Revolutionary Proletariat of Germany” signed by the CentralCommittee of the party and its parliamentary group. 
 Theideas, or rather the lack of ideas, underlying this appealare so characteristic of not only the German, but of theworld’s labour movement, that they deserve to be dwelt upon. 
 But first I should like to make a digression connected with personal reminiscences. 
 Among the signatures of theparliamentary group of Independents I came across thenames of Seger and Laukant, and they reminded me ofwhat happened three years ago. 
 I had occasion to meetLaukant at a meeting of the Zimmerwaldists in Berne. 
 130 This seemingly influential Berlin worker produced a dual impression: on the one hand, serious revolutionary workamong the masses, on the other, an astonishing lack of theoretical * and appalling short -sightedness. 
 Laukant did not like my sharp attacks on Kautsky (the ideological “leader” of the Independents, or rather leader of their non-ideology), but he did not refuse to help me when, doubtful of my unreliable German, I showed him the textof a short speech in German I had written, ** in which I quoted the statement of the “American Bebel”, EugeneDebs, to the effect that he would rather be shot than agree to vote for imperialist war loans, and that he would agree to fight only in a war of the workers against the capitalists. 
On the other hand, when, with furious indignation,I showed Laukant the passage from Kautsky’s article inwhich that gentleman denounced the workers’ streetdemonstrations as adventurism 131 (and that under Wilhelm II) Laukant shrugged his shoulders and answered with exasperating coolness: “Our workers don’t read thisas attentively as all that! I’m not obliged to agree withevery line of Kautsky’s, am I?” Written in the second half of February 1919 First published in 1933 Printed from the manuscript in Lenin Miscellany XXIV DRAFT DECISION FOR THE COUNCIL OF DEFENCE ON REGULATING RELATIONS BETWEEN THE VECHEKA, THE RAILWAY CHEKA AND THE COMMISSARIAT FOR RAILWAYS AND A LETTER TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL OF DEFENCE Decision of the Council of Defence 28.

 Local sections of the Railway Cheka to be given the right to use the railway telegraph (for payment) and made tobear strict responsibility for using it without need. 
 Detailed instructions on the use of the telegraph and method of payment to be issued by the People’s Commissar forRailways and the Chairman of the Vecheka by agreement. 
 The former premises of the railway police to be turned over to the Railway Cheka, and a special order to thiseffect to be issued by the C.

 Comrades Dzerzhinsky and Sklyansky to issue joint instructions concerning the eviction of military guards from these premises. 
 Food rations to be issued in the usual way to the Railway Cheka from the supplies of the railway food organisations. 
 So long as martial law introduced on the railways by the Council of Defence continues, the district transport departments of the Cheka are to be given the right to apply capital punishment to persons found guilty of bribery, theftof freights and railway material, and systematic abuse onthe part of officials.

 The Allies are making their last desperate effort to crush us by force of arms. 
The food situation in the spring is the most difficult. 
 Thetransport system is utterly disrupted. 
 Only the greatest effort can save us. 
 Victory is possible. 
 The revolution in Hungary has proved conclusively that the Soviet movement in Western Europe is growing and its victory is not far off. 
 We have many allies all over theworld, more than we imagine. 
 We must hold on for anotherfour or five difficult months in order to beat our enemies. 
 This meeting harshly condemns the Left Socialist -Revolutionaries, * the Mensheviks and the Right S. 
R. 
s who, while paying lip -service to Soviet power or protesting in word against the armed intervention of the Allies, arein fact helping the whiteguards when they agitate for strikes or for cessation of the civil war (although we offered peaceto all! 136) or for concessions to freedom of trade, and so on. 
 This meeting declares that all those Mensheviks and Socialist -Revolutionaries who are prepared to help us in our difficult struggle shall be ensured full liberty as citizensof the Soviet Republic. 
 This meeting, however, declares relentless war upon those Mensheviks and Socialist -Revolutionaries who, like the literary and political groups Vsegda Vperyod!137 and *The first sheet of the manuscript is missing. 
 The text up to the words “Left Socialist -Revolutionaries” is printed from the typewritten copy.

 Dyelo Naroda ,138 are actually impeding our struggle, actually assisting the whiteguards. 
 This meeting calls upon all workers, all workers’ organi -sations and all working peasants to exert every effort to repel the enemies of Soviet power, to defend that power andimprove the food supply and transport systems. 
 1. 
 To enlist members of the middle section—i. 
e. 
, people who are less experienced than the advanced workers and peasants—to replace the overworked advanced section. 
 2. 
 To send more and more contingents of the advanced and rank -and-file workers out on food supply, transport and army work. 
 3. 
 To enlist the largest possible number of politically conscious workers and peasants for work at the People’s Commissariat for Railways and the State Control, in order to improve the functioning of these bodies and to eliminatebureaucracy and red tape. 
 4. 
 To transfer as many people as possible from the starving cities to agricultural work, to vegetable gardening,to the rural districts, to the Ukraine, to the Don region, and so forth, in order to increase grain production. 
 All efforts to be exerted to assist the middle peasants, to put a stop to the abuses from which they so often suffer,and to render them comradely help. 
 Those Soviet officialswho refuse to carry out this policy—which is the onlycorrect one—or who fail to understand it, must be imme -diately dismissed. 
 5. 
 To combat all signs of weariness, faint -heartedness and vacillation, to enhearten in every way those who showsuch signs, strengthen their spirit, consciousness andcomradely discipline. 
 The working class and the peasantryof Russia have borne incredible burdens. 
 The last few months have been incredibly difficult. 
 But this meeting declares that the workers have not lost heart, that the working classremains at its post, that it will overcome all difficultiesand maintain at all costs the victory of the Soviet SocialistRepublic in Russia and throughout the world.

 SECRETARIAT 19. 
VII. 
1919 The delay in endorsing the instructions concerning food parcels from the army144 is an outrageous and intolerable piece of red tape. 
 It is necessary to ascertain who the culprits are and generally have this case investigated, first, in order toestablish responsibility, second—and most important ofall—in order to work out practical measures to make a repetition of this impossible. 
 I therefore order the institutions listed below, who were to have taken care of the speedy enforcement of the law on food parcels, to immediately, rigorously and carefully investigate the cause of this red tape by collecting all relevant documents and questioning all persons concerned and submit to the C . 
P. 
C.

C. 
 Politbureau Attaching serious importance to Mamontov’s145 operations and considering the speedy destruction of his detachmentan urgent matter, the Politbureau of the C. 
C. 
 resolves; 1) once more to draw the attention of the People’s Commissars for Post and Telegraph and for Railways to the necessity of exerting every effort to improve post and telegraph connections in the area of Mamontov ’s operations and speed up the transportation of troops in that area. 
 *Following this are the words “composed of” written in the manuscript by L.

 2) Comrade Trotsky to be charged with (a) drawing up a draft appeal by telegraph to the Party organisations of the given area with a repeat appeal for more energetic actions; (b) taking part together with Comrade Lashevich(Lashevich retaining personal command) in all opera -tions for routing Mamontov, to the extent of hiscomplete liquidation, in order that the authority of the C. 
C. 
 and the Revolutionary Military Council of the Republic may be displayed in all these operationswith greater speed and determination 146; (c) calling in volunteers against Mamontov from thegubernias of Tver, Kostroma. 
 Yaroslavl and Ivanovo -Voznesensk. 
 2 Draft directives of the C. 
C. 
 Politbureau to be drawn up at once. 
 It is considered politically essential 1) to speed up transportation of the Belebei Bashkir Division to Petrograd and effect this movement as energetic -ally as possible; 2) Tula and the defence of the north generally against Mamontov being sufficiently covered, the 21st Division, inits known and greater part, is to be transferred to the Southern Front with the double objective of catching Mamontov from the south and taking part in the fightingon the Southern Front. 
 3 I propose the following addenda to the decision of the Politbureau (measures against Mamontov): 1) appointment of chiefs of every section (10 to 30 versts, etc. 
) in case of encirclement, of whom 1 -2 to be Communists. 
 2) those refusing to leave the railway cars to be shot on the spot; 3) further draconian measures to tighten discipline. 
 The right of decision to introduce these measures to be given to Lashevich & Trotsky . 
 ((Redirect before reaching Moscow. 
)) &3)Speed up dispatch of each troop train of the 21st Division to go into immediate action against Mamontov with the addition ( if necessary ) of Communists.

” To which the Ambassadorreplied: “I proffer you a friendly hand and hope that youwill help the whole of the East to free itself from the yoke of European imperialism. 
” During the talk that followed, Lenin said that Soviet power, the power of the workingpeople and the oppressed, was striving towards the verygoal the Afghan Ambassador Extraordinary had spokenabout, but that it was necessary that the Moslem Eastshould realise this and help Soviet Russia in her great war of liberation. 
 To this the Ambassador replied that he could assert that the Moslem East realised this and the hour wasnot far off when the world would see that there was no roomfor European imperialism in the East. 
 Afterwards the Ambassador stood up and with the words: “I have the honour of presenting my Sovereign’s letter to the Head of the free Russian proletarian Government and hope that the Soviet Government will give due consideration towhat the Afghan Government is writing about,” he handedLenin the Amir’s letter. 
 Comrade Lenin answered that heaccepted the letter with the greatest pleasure and promisedshortly to give a reply to all the questions Afghanistan was interested in.

 232, October 17, 1919 SPEECH TO IVANOVO -VOZNESENSK COMMUNIST WORKERS LEAVING FOR THE FRONT OCTOBER 24, 1919156 REPORTER’S NOTES In his speech Comrade Lenin described the general situation at our fronts and pointed out that it was the duty of every intelligent worker to render the greatest possibleassistance to our fronts in the matter of proper supply ofmunitions, food, clothing, etc. 
 He expressed his conviction that the communist workers of Ivanovo -Voznesensk would be able to exercise a beneficial influence on the peasants in the front -line area and be a great help in conducting political work among the Cossacks. 
 Pravda No. 
 232 and Printed from the Pravda text October 25, 1919 SPEECH TO ADULT -EDUCATION COURSE STUDENTS LEAVING FOR THE FRONT OCTOBER 28, 1919 The conference opened with a speech by Lenin. 
 He greeted the students of the courses, who had resolved to go out tothe front to help the Red Army, and gave a vivid descriptionof the present situation on all the fronts and in the enemy’srear. 
 The bourgeoisie, both of Russia and the West, had begun to celebrate victory prematurely. 
 The Red troops were drivingKolchak before them. 
 Denikin was retreating from Orel. 
There was demoralisation among the White troops. 
 InDenikin’s rear there were uninterrupted uprisings. 
 Todayeven the prosperous Cossacks were going against him. 
 Yudenich had scant forces, consisting mainly of Englishmen. 
 Britain had given him a large fleet. 
 Yudenich’soffensive was intended to save Denikin, draw our forces off,but his plan failed—the workers of Petrograd had displayed examples of heroism. 
 Europe was tensely watching the outcome of the struggle. 
 The workers of France and Britain had already registered their protest against the attack upon Russia. 
 Bolshevism in these countries was gaining ground. 
 The elections in France were very significant in this respect . 
157 Our chief attention was now directed to the Southern Front, where indescribably furious and sanguinary battles were raging, and where the fate of the revolution in the West as well as in Russia was being decide d.... 
 Danikin’s officer corps was well armed. 
 In view of the uprisings in their rear, they were putting up a desperate fight. 
 But the worker and peasant masses were beginning to see things clearer and there was a strong upsurge among them. 
 Our weakness was that we had too few knowledgeable organisers among the peasants and workers. 
 That was why we had so many old officials, saboteurs, etc. 
, in our insti -tutions. 
 It was necessary to advance the best workers from among the people, and give them knowledge.... 
 It was important to have socia l-minded people capable of talking to the peasants, people who would raise the morale of the army, and therefore everyone going to the front should show an example of bravery and selfless dedication. 
 Victory then will be ours. 
 We shall put transport in order and bring in grain....

 Account of results: top limit of bonuses. 
 Accounts on this not provided for. 
 Will this not virtually legalise grossabuses? Consumers should be enlisted for standard control.

190 Lenin First published in 1945 Printed from the manuscript in Lenin Miscellany XXXV SPEECH AT A CONFERENCE OF CHAIRMEN OF GUBERNIA AND UYEZD EXECUTIVE COMMITTEES FEBRUARY 1, 1920 At a meeting of executive committee chairmen preceding the opening of the session,191 Lenin said, in dealing with the current situation: In so far as the international situation stays as it is, and the whole course of events points to its stability, the tasks of economic activities should be advanced by us to the fore. 
 As regards transport, we not only have to bring this to the fore, but simply drag this transport out by the ears, save it from imminent disaster. 
 Trains carrying grain are stopping, we have more grain than we can transport. 
 Military operations are often impeded through lack of transport. 
 February is the most difficult month for transport, and we are simply heading for disaster. 
 We are threatened by a danger of transport dislocation more serious than in October, when Yudenich and Denikin were winning their biggest victories. 
 More energy must be applied to save transport. 
 We must carry out mobilisations here again and again. 
 We shall have to rob a number of institutions of their workers and keep on robbing them to combat the chaos in transport. 
 The whole art of government and polic y-making consists in being able to assess and know in good time where to concentrate your main forces and attention. 
 We must now extricate transport in the course of two months. 
 Unless we work the same miracle in two months with transport as we have done with Kolchak, disaster threatens us. 
 A number of vigorous and revolutionary measures are needed. 
 This is a military and combat task and calls for combat action in military style.

194 Written Februar y 5, 1920 First publishe d in 1933 Printe d from the manuscript in Leni n Miscellany XXIV SPEEC H AT THE FOURT H CONFERENCE OF GUBERNI A EXTRAORDINAR Y COMMISSION S195 FEBRUARY 6, 1920 Comrades, you will now have to carry on your work under conditions when Soviet Russia is passing to a new phase of activities. 
 You all know, of course, that these conditions of the transition period are due both to interna -tional and internal conditions, or rather to the changed situation both on the international and home fronts that has taken place recently. 
 The fundamental change is that the main forces of the whiteguard counter -revolution have been smashed after the defeat of Yudenich and Kolchak and after the victory overDenikin. 
 We have to be cautious, though, since a hitchhas recently occurred near Rostov and at Novocherkassk,and there is a danger that Denikin may recover. 
 Nevertheless, the main victories create a new situation. 
 Obviously, the bourgeoisie cannot seriously count on things taking a turnin their favour, all the more as the international situation,too, has changed greatly, changed to such an extent thatthe Entente has been obliged to lift the blockade. 
 We havebeen able to conclude peace with Estonia. 
 In this respect we have achieved a basic success which has greatly strengthened our position, and we shall probably securepeace with all the other border states, and then an invasionby the Entente will practically be ruled out. 
 Thus, the first acute moment of our struggle with the counter -revolution, with the whiteguard armed force, both overt and covert—this first acute period is apparently passing. 
 It is more than likely, however, that attempts atone or another counter -revolutionary movement and revolt will be repeated, and, besides, the experience of the Russianrevolutionary movement shows that attempts of a purelyterrorist nature are often accompanied by a mass armed struggle, and therefore it is natural to expect that the counter -revolutionary armed officer force—an element probably most accustomed to handling and using arms—willnot miss a chance to make use of these arms for their ownends. 
 So though the death sentence, after the capture of Rostov, has been abolished on Comrade Dzerzhinsky’s initiative, a reservation was made at the very beginning thatwe do not by any means close our eyes to the possibilityof restoring capital punishment. 
 With us this is a matterof expediency. 
 It goes without saying that the Sovietgovernment will not keep the death penalty longer than is absolutely necessary, and by doing away with it, has taken a step that no democratic government of any bourgeoisrepublic has ever taken. 
 You are aware that the great majority of the workers and peasants in all the outlying districts, who were under the yoke of the whiteguards, have come over to our side. 
 The longer they were under that yoke the more stronglyhave they sided with us. 
 And so we know that all the attemptsof the bourgeoisie are doomed to failure. 
 But that theseattempts are possible, we know only too well from the twoyears’ experience of Soviet power. 
 We have seen tens of thousands of officers, landowner elements, stopping at no crimes, concluding agreements with the agents of imperialistforeign powers to blow up bridges. 
 And we say that attemptslike these will go on. 
 With due consideration for the newgeneral position of the state, we must nevertheless remainalert and remember that though the period of armed struggle on a big historical scale is coming to end, we must on no account exclude the possibility of our having to keep ina state of preparedness. 
 The problem set before the agencies of suppression of the counter -revolution, before the agencies of the Cheka, and still facing them today, is a complex and difficult one. 
 On the one hand, they must realise and make allowance for the transition from war to peace, and, on the other, theymust be on guard all the time, since we do not know howlong it will take to secure a lasting peace; we must takeinto account what effect this new approach will have onthe bourgeois sections of the population, we must bear in mind, test in practice what these changes will yield, and only after all this has been taken into consideration,introduce one or another modification on the basis ofsuch practical experience. 
 In a word, we must continue to keep fighting fit to be able to repulse the enemy. 
 There may possibly be attempts at invasion, Denikin may possibly fortify his position to continue the civil war, there may possibly be attempts atterror on the part of groups of counter -revolutionaries, and it is our duty to be always in fighting trim. 
 While keepingin fighting trim, keeping the apparatus for suppressing theresistance of the exploiters alerted, we must take into account the new transition from war to peace and gradually change our tactics, change the nature of repressivemeasures. 
 /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR This question, I believe, played no small part in your discussions, and you, of course, have much more to go on than I have in the matter of practical concrete decisions. 
 I have no doubt that you will try to study this material in aconcrete, practical way. 
 You must work out in what directionthe agencies for suppressing the counter -revolution are to modify their activities in the recently liberated parts ofRussia, in Siberia and the Ukraine, how, in keeping with this, we are to change our activities. 
 I shall not go into details or enlarge on this, because I have not had a chanceto study the factual material, but I repeat—the importantthing is to take into account the concrete facts that havecome to light in the work of every Cheka. 
 Moreover, theaim of such conferences is to enable you to discuss the factual material in greatest possible detail, so that local workers should not shut themselves up in their own narrowcircle, but should be able, as a result of such an exchangeof opinions, to devise more durable and lasting tactics. 
 I should like in particular to draw attention to a question that now confronts the agencies of suppression of the counter -revolution, the agencies combating espionage and profiteering, namely, to the bloodless front of labour,a question that is now becoming a key issue in the buildingup of Soviet power, in the strengthening of the workers’and peasants’ rule and the revival of the ruined economy. 
 You know that the task of fighting Kolchak, Yudenich and Denikin, who have been supported by the Entente, the task of fighting the counter -revolutionary landowners and capitalists who were convinced up till now that theirvictory was secure, since the wealthiest Powers in the worldwere on their side—this task called for an exertion of allthe country’s strength, because the very existence of the Soviet Republic was at stake. 
 During these two years Soviet power can be said to have accomplished what is nothing short of a miracle, for in thestruggle against international capital we have succeededin winning such an incredible, such an amazing victory asthe world has never known. 
 This has happened because all our forces were closely united, because we had a real dicta -torship of the proletariat in action in the sense that the vanguard, the best advance guard of the working class during these two years of Soviet government displayed unheard -of heroism and determination, while all the vacillating elements among the less developed section of the working class and the peasantry, who went througha long range of fluctuations, found themselves leaning moreand more to our side. 
 The more trials they went through,the sooner did they side with us. 
 To achieve such a concentration of forces we had to resort to measures of coercion in face of all the lamentations, regrets and complaints. 
 Both before and after the OctoberRevolution we held the view that the birth of a new orderwas impossible without revolutionary coercion, that allthe regrets and complaints that we hear from non -Party petty -bourgeois intellectuals are simply reactionary. 
 History, which is propelled by a fierce class struggle, has shown that when the landowners and capitalists felt that it was a questionof the last decisive fight, they stopped at nothing. 
 History has shown that without revolutionary coercion victory cannot be achieved. 
 Without revolutionary coerciondirected against the avowed enemies of the workers and peasants, it is impossible to break down the resistance of these exploiters. 
 On the other hand, revolutionary coercionis bound to be employed towards the wavering and unstableelements among the masses themselves. 
 Today we are witnessing the tremendous victory of the Red Army, but if we look back over the last two years of Soviet government and think of how we advanced towards these victories, we are bound to remember that the OctoberRevolution started when the army was completely de -moralised and there was a complete absence of any militaryorganisation. 
 We had no army, and were obliged to scrapeone together, to weld, muster and build this army up anew by long hard work. 
 And in building up this new disciplined Red Army we had to resort to revolutionary coercion. 
 Andthis revolutionary coercion was quite rightly applied toself -seeking elements. 
 At a time when the advanced section of the population were giving all their strength to the fightagainst the counter -revolution, at a time when thousands of them, with the greatest self -sacrifice, were laying down their lives on the fields of battle, the backward elementsamong the peasantry who had received land, and the backward elements among the workers, were working only for themselves. 
 At that time the advanced elements had to build up and strengthen the new discipline, which was maintained by revolutionary coercion and which could beso maintained only because the public -spirited section of the workers and peasants, of all the working masses, sympathisedwith this coercion, realised that without this iron disciplinewe could not have built up the Red Army, could not have held our own in the two years of struggle and generally could not have stood up against organised and united capital. 
In this respect, the tasks of cultivating discipline, maintain -ing discipline and rallying our forces to face the comingstruggle—these tasks are now gradually being modified. 
At first we gave all our forces to the war, all the forces of the ruined country. 
 This condemned the country to still greater ruin. 
 No one believed two years ago that Russia, a country ravaged by four years of imperialist war, could withstandanother two years of civil war. 
 In fact, if we were asked atthe end of October 1917 whether we would survive two years of civil war against the world’s bourgeoisie, I doubt whether many of us would have answered in the affirmative. 
 Events,however, have shown that the energy which the worker andpeasant masses developed proved to be greater than thepeople who had made the October Revolution believed. 
As a result, we have received—and the home fronts have shown us—a source of new strength considerably greater than anything we had counted on. 
 At the same time thissource has shown that the Red Army, which is capable ofwinning victories on the war fronts, is meeting with newobstacles on the home fronts—this is particularly the casein transport. 
 Of course, things are bad with us as regards food, too, cold and hunger are worse than ever now, but with the liberation of the richest grain -producing gubernias the food situation is improving, and our chief crisis nowis transport. 
 It should be said that the same crisis existsin all the richest countries, who have never experiencedsuch a long war. 
 Even these countries are suffering from a shortage of railway cars. 
 So you can imagine what is hap -pening with us in Russia, who has been at war six years and had had her bridges and locomotives deliberately destroyed. 
 Our position, in this respect, is a very difficult one, of course, and the task of the Cheka’s transport departments, of their whole organism, the efforts of all the revolutionary social -minded masses, are aimed at helping the country to extricate itself from this critical plight, which withoutexaggeration can be said to verge on catastrophe. 
 Anotherthing to be borne in mind is that the state of the railwaysin February, what with the winter snowdrifts, is always worse, even during ordinary times, than at any other season. 
 At present our transport crisis has reached a stage whenthe railways are threatened with a complete stoppage. 
Lately, Moscow has had only a three -day supply of bread, while dozens of trains have been held up through lackof fuel. 
 We are well aware of the methods for coping with this disastrous situation, which we have been using during twoyears of war. 
 These methods are—raising the social conscious -ness of the masses and appealing directly to them. 
 In everysuch crisis we deemed it our duty to appeal to the worker andpeasant masses and describe to them the difficult situation that had arisen. 
 We appealed to them and pointed out on whom the salvation of Soviet Russia depended and whateffort was needed to concentrate on a single definite task. 
These tasks often changed while Soviet power was engagedin fighting its enemies, and a proper understanding of thestate’s position depends upon the ability to grasp what tasks have to be tackled in order to cope with the economic chaos and pass on to the normal work of economic organi -sation. 
 Now, too, you know that most attention was givento explaining the critical position of the railways to theworkers and peasants. 
 A tremendous effort is needed hereon the part of the proletariat and the peasantry. 
 Such a thing as the delivery of fuel is a difficult problem, which cannot possibly be coped with unless the worker and peasantpopulation give themselves to the task with enthusiasm,unless there is a spurt of collective mass effort such as wewitnessed during the best period of the Red Army’s victories. 
Today, for example, the delivery of fuel and the clearing of railway tracks meet with difficulties arising from the fact that the peasants were given a number of promises tocompensate them for their food products. 
 Naturally, deliveries require draft horses, and the peasants out there are unable to provide these, they are very unwilling and unfriendly, as they do not receive compensation in the way of a definite amount of goods; and we, owing to the almostcomplete stoppage of transport, are not in a position togive them any commodities worth speaking of. 
 We say thatthe peasants should do this as a loan to their workers’ andpeasants’ state in order to save the starving workers and put industry on its feet. 
 The peasants should give this loan, because, for instance, in some places the peasantry aresuffering terribly from a shortage of salt, while we haveenormous stocks of this salt which we are unable to deliversince the railways do not cope with the task of transportingthe absolutely essential amount of breadstuffs. 
 We have here a situation that calls for still greater discipline, for propaganda and agitation to educate andunite all the workers and peasants. 
 The use of revolutionarycoercion turns this discipline into something real anddefinite, showing that the class -conscious working class has set itself a definite practical task, which we shall see through to its conclusion. 
 Just as in the period of our most difficult struggle against Yudenich, Kolchak and Denikin,when we advanced Communists, leading workers, to thefront ranks, made great sacrifices, giving the lives of ourbest fighters and at the same time building up disciplineand punishing self -seekers—we achieved the maximum exertion of the people’s energy, and we won; so today, too, we must set ourselves the same aim and achieve it at allcosts by the same methods if we are to save transport. 
 We have grain, salt, we have sufficient quantities of raw materials and fuel, we can put industry back on itsfeet, but this will take months of hard efforts, and in these efforts the agencies of the Cheka must become an instrument for carrying out the centralised will of the proletariat, aninstrument of discipline such as we succeeded in creatingin the Red Army. 
 And I am sure that after this meeting, in the practical work of your agencies, and here, too, you will come to an understanding of the role the uyezd transport departments of the Cheka are to play, of the way they should organisetheir work, how they should advance new people from their midst in order to fight the profiteers and saboteurs, who are more numerous among the railwaymen than anywhere else. 
 This is a task of your practical experience, a task you will have to carry out by way of an exchange of opinions. 
 The railways are notable in that we have there a majority of workers on a workin g-class level and a minority who engage in profiteering, and here it is the task of the Transport Cheka to secure a correct division of labour, responsibility for economising labour power, and secure all this through the efforts of the communist elements among the railwaymen. 
 Only by relying on these best masses shall we be able to create a force that will cope with profiteers and gain the upper hand over these elements, recruited during the worst days of tsarism. 
 To overcome this force inherited by us from capitalism we have one means—that of tightening discipline and developing revolutionary energy to the utmost. 
 The Cheka should rely on the communist groups, on the trade unions—combine its work with propaganda and agitation, evoke among the bulk of the railwaymen a con-scious attitude towards this struggle. 
 And I am sure that by strict organisation and with our previous experience to go on, we shall achieve in our work results as good as those we achieved in the armed struggle.

 afresh through Poland. 
 At first glance the Supreme Council’s proposition looks plausible enough—the resumption of commercial relations through the medium of the Russianco -operatives. 
 But the co -operatives do not any longer exist, having been assimilated into our Soviet distributionorgans. 
 Therefore what is meant when the Allies talk ofdealing with the co -operatives? Certainly it is not clear. 
 “Therefore I say that closer examination convinces us that this Paris decision is simply a move in the Alliedchess game the motives of which are still obscure. 
” Lenin paused a moment, then added with a broad grin: “Far obscurer, for instance, than Marshal Foch’s intended visit to Warsaw. 
” I asked if he deemed the probability of a Polish offensive serious (it must be recalled that in Russia the talk was of a drive by the Poles against the Bolsheviki, not vice versa). 
 “Beyond doubt,” Lenin replied, “Clemenceau and Foch are very, very serious gentlemen, and the one originated and the other is going to carry out this offensive scheme. 
 It is a grave menace, of course, but we have faced graverones. 
 It does not cause us fear so much as disappointmentthat the Allies should still pursue the impossible. 
 For aPolish offensive can no more settle the Russian problemfor them than did Kolchak’s and Denikin’s. 
 Poland has many troubles of her own, remember. 
 And it is obvious that she can get no help from any of her neighbours, includingRoumania. 
” “Yet peace seems nearer than before,” I suggested. 
 “Yes, that’s true. 
 If peace is a corollary of trade with us, the Allies cannot avoid it much longer. 
 I have heard that Millerand, Clemenceau’s successor, expresses willingnessto envisage commercial relations with the Russian people. 
Perhaps this heralds a change of front among the Frenchcapitalists. 
 But Churchill is still strong in England, andLloyd George, who probably wants to do business with us, dare not risk an open rupture with the political and financial interests supporting the Churchill policy. 
” UNITED STATES OPPRESSES SOCIALISTS “And America?” “It is hard to see clearly what is going on there. 
 Yourbankers seem to fear us more than ever. 
 At any rate, yourGovernment is instituting more violently repressive measuresnot only against the socialists but against the workingclass in general than any other government, even the reactionary French. 
 Apparently it is persecuting foreigners. 
 And yet, what would America be without her foreignworkers? They are an absolute necessity to your economicdevelopment . 
 “Still, some American manufacturers appear to have begun to realise that making money in Russia is wiser than making war against Russia, which is a good sign. 
 We shall need American manufactures—locomotives, automobiles,etc. 
—more than those of any other country. 
” “And your peace terms?” “It is idle to talk further about them,” Lenin returned emphatically. 
 “All the world knows that we are prepared to make peace on terms the fairness of which even the mostimperialistic capitalists could not dispute. 
 We have reiteratedand reiterated our desire for peace, our need for peaceand our readiness to give foreign capital the most generousconcessions and guarantees. 
 But we do not propose to be strangled to death for the sake of peace. 
 “I know of no reason why a socialistic commonwealth like ours cannot do business indefinitely with capitalisticcountries. 
 We don’t mind taking their capitalistic locomo -tives and farming machinery, so why should they mindtaking our socialistic wheat, flax and platinum. 
 Socialistic corn tastes the same as any other corn, does it not? Of course, they will have to have business relations with the dreadfulBolsheviks—that is, the Soviet Government. 
 But it shouldnot be harder for American steel manufacturers, for instance,to deal with the Soviets than it was for them to deal withEntente governments in their war -time munition deals. 
” EUROPE DEPENDENT ON RUSSIA “That is why this talk of reopening trade with Russia through co -operatives seems to us insincere, or at least, obscure—a move in a game of chess rather than a frank, straightforward proposition that would be immediately grasped and acted upon. 
 Moreover, if the Supreme Councilreally means to lift the blockade, why doesn’t it tell usof its intentions? We are without official word from Paris. 
What little we know is derived from newspaper despatchespicked up by our wireless. 
 “The statesmen of the Entente and the United States do not seem to understand that Russia’s present economicdistress is simply a part of the world’s economic distress. 
Until the economic problem is faced from a world standpointand not merely from the standpoint of certain nations orgroup of nations, a solution is impossible. 
 Without Russia, Europe cannot get on her feet. 
 And with Europe prostrate, America’s position becomes critical. 
 What good is America’swealth if she cannot buy with it that which she needs? America cannot eat or wear the gold she has accumulated, can she? She can’t trade profitably, that is, on a basis that will be of real value to her, with Europe until Europe is able to give her the things she wants in exchange forthat which she has to give. 
 And Europe cannot give herthose things until she is on her feet economically. 
” WORLD NEEDS RUSSIAN GOODS “In Russia we have wheat, flax, platinum, potash and many minerals of which the whole world stands in desperateneed. 
 The world must come to us for them in the end,Bolshevism or no Bolshevism. 
 There are signs that a reali -sation of this truth is gradually awakening. 
 But meanwhile not only Russia but all Europe is going to pieces, and the Supreme Council still indulges in tergiversation. 
 Russiacan be saved from utter ruin and Europe too, but it mustbe done soon and quickly. 
 And the Supreme Council is soslow, so very slow. 
 In fact, it has already been dissolved,I believe, in favour of a Council of Ambassadors, leaving nothing settled and with only a League of Nations which is nonexistent, still -born, to take its place. 
 How can the League of Nations possibly come to life without the UnitedStates to give it backbone!” I inquired as to whether the Soviet Government was satisfied with the military situation. 
 “Very much so,” Lenin replied promptly. 
 “The only symptoms of further military aggression against us arethose I spoke of in Poland. 
 If Poland embarks on such anadventure there will be more suffering on both sides, morelives needlessly sacrificed. 
 But even Foch could not givethe Poles a victory. 
 They could not defeat our Red Army even if Churchill himself fought with them. 
” Here Lenin threw back his head and laughed grimly. 
 Then he went on in a graver vein: “We can be crushed, of course, by any one of the big Allied Powers if they can send their own armies against us. 
But that they dare not do. 
 The extraordinary paradox is that weak as Russia is compared with the Allies’ boundless resources she has not only been able to shatter every armed force, including British, American and French troops that they have managed to send against her, but to win diplomatic and moral victories as well over the cordon sanitairecountries. 
 Finland refused to fight against us. 
 We havepeace with Estonia, and peace with Serbia * and Lithuania199 is at hand. 
 Despite material inducements offered to andsinister threats made against these small countries by the Entente, they preferred to establish pacific relations with us. 
” INTERNAL SITUATION HOPEFUL “This assuredly demonstrates the tremendous moral force we hold. 
 The Baltic states, our nearest neighbours, appreciate that we alone have no designs against their independence and well -being. 
” “And Russia’s internal situation?” “It is critical but hopeful. 
 With spring the food shortage will be overcome to the extent at least of saving the cities from famine. 
 There will be sufficient fuel then too. 
 The reconstruction period is under way, thanks to the RedArmy’s stupendous performances. 
 Now parts of that armyare transformed into armies of labour, an extraordinaryphenomenon only possible in a country struggling towarda high ideal. 
 Certainly it could not be done in capitalist countries. 
 We have sacrificed everything to victory over our armed antagonists in the past; and now we shall turnall our strength to economic rehabilitation. 
 It will takeyears, but we shall win out in the end. 
” “When do you think Communism will be complete in Russia?” The question was a poser, I thought, but Lenin replied immediately: “We mean to electrify our entire industrial system through power stations in the Urals and elsewhere. 
 Our engineers tell us it will take ten years. 
 When the electrifica -tion is accomplished it will be the first important stage onthe road to the communistic administration of public *This is a mistake on the part of the newspaper. 
 Serbia was not at war with Soviet Russia. 
 This obviously refers to Latvia. 
— Ed. 
 economic life. 
 All our industries will receive their motive power from a common source, capable of supplying them all adequately. 
 This will eliminate wasteful competition in the quest of fuel, and place manufacturing enterpriseon a sound economic footing, without which we cannothope to achieve a full measure of interchange of essentialproducts in accordance with Communist principles. 
 “Incidentally, in three years we expect to have 50,000,000 incandescent lamps burning in Russia. 
 There are 70,000,000 in the United States, I believe, but in a land where electricityis in its infancy more than two -thirds of that number is a very high figure to achieve. 
 Electrification is to my mindthe most momentous of the great tasks that confront us. 
” SCORES SOCIALIST LEADERS At the close of our talk Lenin delivered himself, not for publication, however, of some cutting criticism of certain Socialist leaders in Europe and America which revealed his lack of faith in the ability or evendesire of these gentry to promote world revolution effectively. 
 Heevidently feels that Bolshevism will come to pass in spite of, ratherthan because of, the “official” chieftains of Socialism.

 40 PREFAC E TO THE ENGLIS H EDITION OF THE PAMPHLET THE PROLETARIA N REVOLUTION AND KAUTSK Y THE RENEGAD E206 Preface to the English Edition The comrades who intend to publish my pamphlet against Kautsky in English, which has also been published in German,207 have asked me to write a preface to the English edition. 
 I would prefer, in lieu of a short preface, to give a detailed analysis of one of the writings of J. 
 Ramsay Macdonald, who, as far as I know, is one of the most influential andwidely read of English writers of practically the same Kautskyan trend. 
 Unfortunately, I was unable to obtain Macdonald’s book Parliament and Revolution 208 which has short chapters on Soviet democracy and Soviet suffrage, but the author’s Kautskyan point of view is quite clear from his article “Socialist Review Outlook” published in The Socialist Review , October -December 1919, of which he is the editor. 
 Macdonald is not a Marxist, and the Marxist -tinted opportunism characteristic of Kautsky is not typicalof England. 
 As I have no time just now to give a detailed analysis of Macdonald’s views, I shall confine myself to an attempt at briefly describing his views as known to us from his political activities, from the newspaper of his party (the“Independent” Labour Party—independent in word andfully dependent on bourgeois prejudices in deed), from hismagazine and in particular from the article just mentioned. 
 I shall first quote some of the most characteristic passages from this article: Describing the general political situation, Macdonald writes: “...Never was honest service and labour held in lower esteem” (p. 
 306). 
“...Our ships of war continuing the starvation of women and children. 
We are in every mean and wicked conspiracy to subvert democracyin Europe. 
 Though the State is tottering on the verge of bankruptcy, a Minister to gratify his personal vanity, and a small class of finan -ciers to secure personal profit in the future, can add what will probably amount to £100,000,000 further burden upon the British taxpayer,for a Russian venture ...” (p. 
 307). 
 “The storm in the teacup inside the Parliamentary Labour Party, because Mr. 
 Neil MacLean remainedseated during a theatrical display when the Prime Minister was being welcomed for bringing in his pocket from Paris one of the worst in-struments that ever terminated a war, shows this same proneness ? in the Party to be stampeded by trivial fears. 
” “The Labour Party hasto save itself from chastisement; it cannot allow handbills to be issuedagainst its candidates, headed: ‘The Labour Party condones an insult to our Gracious Sovereign. 
’” “Such a state of things,” declares brave Mr. 
 Macdonald, “is not healthy; it contains no promise of great reform....

 What was formerly called “general public norm” to be changed to “norm for unemployed and small proprietors” or: self -employed citizens, people not working, etc. 
 (or “small proprietors”), “people not working in Soviet enterprises or offices”. 
 Advantage: (1) simplifies things tremendously in capital cities and all non -farming, industrial towns (as the bulk there work in Soviet enterprises or Soviet offices). 
 (2) In non-industrial towns we clearly set apart the population that is not working in Soviet enterprises orSoviet offices, and this population should gradually be taken off rations (either start a vegetable garden of your own or go to work in Soviet enterprises or Soviet offices). 
 We shall not feed those who do not work in Soviet enterprises or Soviet offices. 
 Figure out under what system there will be less food coupons and the system itself more simple.

 I. 
 Lenin delivered a short but impressive speech on the significance of Karl Marx as a socialist leader. 
 “The working people were enslaved, despite political liberties. 
 Now they are moving towards the workers’ revolu -tion, which will create a socialist society without landownersand capitalists. 
 To Russia has fallen the great honour and joy of helping to establish this socialist society and a world Soviet Republic. 
 Today, on this international festival oflabour, when we wish to prove to everybody that we shallsucceed in coping with the task of organising a socialistsociety of the working people, we honour the memory ofKarl Marx. 
 And I am confident that the laying of this monument to our great teacher will serve as a call impelling us to give all our attention to the need for working hardand long to create a society in which there will be no roomfor exploitation.

Already in those days Comrade Zagorsky, who was secretaryof the Geneva group of Bolsheviks, impressed one as beingan energetic, clever man and a good organiser devoted heartand soul to the cause of the Party. 
 When Zagorsky returned to Moscow in 1918 he threw himself into Party work and was shortly elected secretary of the Moscow organisation,at which honourable post he died during the explosionin Leontievsky Pereulok.

 NAKAHIRA, CORRESPONDENT OF THE JAPANES E NEWSPAPE R OSAK A ASAHI 216 He did not wait for our question, but started to speak of the relations between Japan and Russia—to the effect that it is regrettable that Japan does not seem willing toadopt an attitude of willingness to meet the SovietGovernment’s attitude of peace. 
 The Soviet Government stands for peace, and therefore it recognises the neutral zone government. 
 217 He then asked: “Is there a powerful landowning class in Japan? Does the Japanese farmer own land freely? Do theJapanese people live on food produced in their own country,or do they import much food from foreign countries?” He asked many other questions, showing his deep interest in living conditions in Japan. 
 Mr. 
 Lenin next asked whether Japanese parents beat their children, and said he had read of this in a book. 
 “Tellme whether it is true or not,” said he, “it is a very interestingsubject. 
” I answered that there may be exceptions, but as a rule parents do not beat their children in Japan. 
 On hearing my answer he expressed satisfaction and said thatthe policy of the Soviet Government is to abolish thiscondition. 
 After that we asked about the revolution andsubsequent developments. 
 In giving a résumé of Russian revolutionary history, he said: “Before the revolution, the working and peasantclasses of Russia were extremely oppressed—in fact, theiroppression was without parallel in past history. 
 As a resultof this most severe oppression, the revolutionary spirit ofthe poorer class gradually increased until it broke out inthe revolution. 
 But the organising capacity of the lower strata of Russia is comparatively weak and the degree of education lower than in any other countries. 
 In spite of all this they could not be suppressed. 
 But now, after two anda half years of experience, the Russian working and peasantmasses have obtained a great deal of political and socialdiscipline. 
 The experience of this two and a half years can truly be compared with the development of several centuries. 
” At this point we asked why the Soviet Republic, in spite of its having repudiated the national debts of czarism, had promised to give Esthonia vast amounts of gold, when concluding peace. 
 Smiling, Mr. 
 Lenin said: “Esthonia hasshown her good will toward the Soviet Government andtherefore the Soviet Government has promised to pay herthis gold. 
 Moreover,” he continued, “to deal with thepropertied class is really a very difficult matter. 
 The propertied class cares for nothing but its own material interests. 
 For instance, look at America. 
 America proposeda peace treaty with Soviet Russia. 
 When we examined thetreaty, we could not accept it because it was based onexploitation. 
 So we rejected it. 
 Of course we do not considerourselves incapable. 
 The Allied nations, rejecting recognition, attempt to interfere with Russia. 
 There is reason to think that if the intervention of the Allies should continue, itwill be profitable to the Bolsheviki. 
 “All in all, considering the prospects of Russia’s indus -tries, the situation is promising. 
 If our electrical programmeis attained entire industries can be electrified. 
 The creative capacity of communism will be increased and will exert the greatest influence in solving these problems, and thedevelopment will be equal to that of several decades.

 91 Translated from the Japanese INTERVIEW WITH K. 
 FUSSE, CORRESPONDENT OF THE JAPANESE NEWSPAPERS OSAKA MAINICHI AND TOKYO NICHI -NICHI Lenin said on meeting Fusse that he was very glad to see him and that despite everything that had taken place in recent years between Russia and Japan and the fact that some people in Japan still took an uncompromising attitude towards Soviet Russia, he nevertheless took an optimistic view of future relations between the two countries. 
 The Soviet Government had recognised the independence of thebuffer state and “this, I hope,” said Lenin, “would helprestore peace in the Far East in the very near future. 
” Fusse started the interview by asking Lenin: “Last autumn you said the difficulties were over. 
 Don’t you foresee big difficulties ahead?” I meant that our greatest difficulties were over; but, of course, there are still many difficulties confronting us. 
 Fusse : “You said it took capitalism many years to accomplish the transition from feudalism, therefore it would also take socialismmany years to accomplish the transition from capitalism. 
 Approxi-mately how long do you think this will take?” Generally, it is hard to fix dates; to overthrow the old order doesn’t require much time, but you can’t create thenew order in a short time. 
 We have launched our plan forthe electrification of industry and agriculture; withoutelectrification the communist order is impracticable, and our plan of electrification is designed for a period of ten years under the most favourable conditions. 
 That’s theshortest time we set for building up our new order. 
 Lenin then asked Fusse a number of questions concerning agrarian and class relations in Japan. 
 What kind of landowners does Japan have? What is the position of the landless peasant in Japan? Are there anypeasant organisations? and so on. 
 Lenin also showed an interest in the state of electrification and public education in Japan and how children were treated in Japan. 
 WhenFusse said that Japan took better care of her children thanthe West, Lenin remarked: “That’s very important, in viewof the fact that the practice of beating children in the schoolshas not yet been entirely eliminated in the so -called civilised countries of Europe, not even in a country like Switzerland. 
” After this Fusse again asked Lenin a number of political questions. 
 Fusse : “How do you visualise good -neighbourly relations between socialist and capitalist states?” Our terms of coexistence with capitalist countries were set forth at length in the draft treaty which the American representative, Mr. 
 Bullitt, recently published in Washington. 
 These terms wore most unfavourable to us, and it was this that led the Allied governments to believe that our willingness to make concessions was a sign of weakness, and they startedtheir intervention, as a result of which they suffered completedefeat. 
 We routed Kolchak, Yudenich and Denikin. 
 Fusse : “Where does communism have more chance of success— in the West or in the East?” So far, real communism can succeed only in the West, but it must be remembered that the West lives at the expenseof the East; the imperialist powers of Europe grow richchiefly at the expense of the eastern colonies, but at thesame time they are arming their colonies and teaching them to fight, and by so doing the West is digging its own grave in the East. 
 Fusse : “What are the immediate tasks of the Soviet Government?” First, to beat the Polish landowners, second, to secure a lasting peace, and then, third, to develop our econom -ic life.

 VEVER, MANAGER OF “GORKI ” SANATORIUM In a statement signed by Comrades Belenky, Ivanichev and Gabalin it has been established that by order of the Manager of the Sanatorium, Comrade Vever, a perfectly sound fir -tree was cut down in the sanatorium’s park on June 14, 1920. 
 For causing damage to Soviet property I order Comrade Vever, Manager of the Sanatorium at the Soviet Gorki Estate, to be placed under arrest for 1 month. 
 Sentence to be executed by the Podolsk Uyezd Executive Committee on the understanding that (1) should it be discovered that Comrade Vever had had no penalties previously imposed upon him, his sentenceshall be suspended after a week’s detention and he shall be warned that in the event of wrongful felling in the park, walks or woods or any other damage to Soviet propertybeing allowed, he will be liable to further punishment overand above 3 weeks’ arrest and to dismissal. 
 (2) The date on which sentence is to be carried out shall be determined by the Uyezd Executive Committee by arrangement with the Uyezd Land Department or the Management of the State Farms to ensure that farm workwill not suffer in any way. 
 I instruct Comrade Belenky to bring this decision to the notice of Comrade Vever and his assistants, who are tosign that it has been announced to them and that any further similar offence will incur punishment for all workers and office staff, and not the manager alone. 
 I instruct the Uyezd Executive Committee to report to me what date they have fixed for the arrest and how thesentence has been carried out.

1920 First published in 1945 Printed from the manuscript in Lenin Miscellany XXXV SPEECH AT A MEETING OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL JUNE 19, 1920 NEWSPAPER REPORT Comrade Lenin put the question this way: what, in effect, does it mean to recognise the dictatorship of theproletariat. 
 It means every day, in propaganda, agitation, speeches and articles, to prepare the proletariat for the conquest of power, for the suppression of the exploiters, the suppression of all the proletariat’s opponents. 
 Comrade Lenin, on the basis of various documents and newspapers, showed what a gulf existed between the Third International and the entire policy of the French Party . 
218 He revealed all the rottenness of the Turatian wing of the Italian Party, which was preventing the party from adopting a correct line.

 Precisely the revolutionary, and only the revolutionary part of the proletariat, to be organised into the party, and a similar part of the party promoted to its leading centres. 
 2. 
 Systematic exposure to the masses of reformism and opportunism in the party and the labour movement. 
 3. 
 Replacement of opportunist leaders in the party’s sections, in the trade unions, in the co -operatives, in clubs, in cultural and educational and all other organisations of the proletariat by revolutionary leaders. 
 4. 
 Formation of communist cells in all and every form of workers’ and small -peasant organisations for systematic leadership of the entire labour movement (and part of thesmall -peasant movement) by the party. 
 5. 
 Obligatory appointment of definitely revolutionary workers who are entirely free from traditions, habits andprejudices of peaceful work, parliamentarism and legalism,and who, even if extremely inexperienced, are (1) capable offighting reformism and opportunism (2) and are in close touch with the rank and file of the proletariat and with its most revolutionary section— —their appointment to top posts in the party in sufficient numbers, especially in the Party’s C. 
C. 
 and the parliamentary group , and in all the most important (for the Party) bodies. 
 6. 
 Especially detailed subordination of the parliamentary group to the Party’s Central Committee and the latter’sstrict supervision over it. 
 7. 
 The people who are to be considered collaborationists, advocates of a bloc between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie=3? and proprietors, are not only those who put this idea into practice directly, who stand for a bloc in the government, etc. 
, but also those who put it into practice indirectly , for instance, those who stand for equality between the workingclass and the class of petty proprietors, for equality intheir points of view, etc. 
 8. 
 Press organs of the reformists (or conciliation with reformism)... * L’Humanite ,223 should be closed down. 
 The party should have 1 central organ of a definitely revo -lutionary trend— not like that of Populaire224 or Freiheit .

: (a) suppression of the resistance of the exploiters (including the kulaks and saboteurs among the intellectuals); (b) confiscation, since redemption payment now, after 1914-18, is impossible; (c) special supervision over the exploiters and bourgeois intellectuals; (d) immediate revolutionary improvement of life for the workers *A word in the manuscript illegible.

C. 
P. 
 (B. 
) SEPTEMBER ùù-ù5, 19ù0242 1 SPEECH ON THE IMMEDIATE TASKS OF PARTY DEVELOPMENT SEPTEMBER 24 Comrades, I think that certain statements made during the debates and even certain speeches are worth mentioningif only because they obviously express not just overstrain, but overstrain bordering on hysteria and therefore giving a misplaced emphasis. 
 I would not call it demagogy. 
 It isphysical overstrain to the point of hysteria. 
 This appliesmainly to the speeches by Lutovinov and Bubnov, in whichthere was less of demagogy than of overstrain. 
 To someextent I think there were signs of overstrain in Medvedev’s statement too. 
 He said: “Now you have all started speaking about unhealthy symptoms, but before you used to deny it,you weren’t telling the truth. 
” I think this explanationis not quite correct, in fact it is quite incorrect. 
 That theunhealthy symptoms we are talking about really exist—washardly a secret. 
 Without a doubt, the general situation was so grave that we couldn’t find time till now for the Party, we had no chance to raise this question speciallyin the Party. 
 Even now we raise it with difficulty, becausethe chance we are discussing here in our political talk—thechance of our being able to avoid a winter campaign—isextremely slender. 
 The general situation of the Republic, as I mentioned, has improved to such an extent that we are now able to discuss things more calmly: there is nolonger any question of suspending the conference the waywe did several times when Kolchak and Denikin wereadvancing. 
 There were Party congresses from which a numberof leading workers went straight off to the front without waiting for them to end. 
 Mind you, we seldom convene congresses, we seldom have a chance of discussing importantissues at congresses—yet before we couldn’t even see acongress through to the end, rarely though it was convened. 
 Today at any rate we can and ought to thresh things out without restricting ourselves. 
 I should also like to say a word about Kalinin’s attempts to present the case ina Marxist way. 
 It seems to me that his arguments were a long step away from Marxism, and the correct Marxist view I think was given in the resolution of the Moscow Commit -tee—which you have all, of course, read and which has been put out in a small pamphlet and printed in Pravda — and the letter of the Central Committee. 
 I should like to read out several lines, which I would offer to the committee (if it be decided to set one up), not in lieu of the Moscow resolution and the C. 
C. 
’s letter, butas supplementary material to them. 
 * The resolution of the Moscow Committee I think—and all are agreed on this— deals with the question correctly. 
 Allow me to quote thosefew words and dwell on them briefly. 
 Here is the addendum: “The indescribably grave position of the Soviet Republic in the early years of its existence, extreme devastationand grave military danger, made it necessary to designate special “shock” (and therefore virtually privileged) departments and groups of workers. 
 This was unavoidable,since the ruined country could not be saved unless resources and energies were concentrated on such departments and such groups of workers, without the strengthening of whichthe imperialists of the whole world would have certainly crushed us and prevented the Soviet Republic from even starting on economic construction.... 
” As regards the old specialists we have heard some very heated attacks here. 
 The truth came out in Comrade Kutuzov’s speech when he said that the proletariat saw noimprovement of its position from Soviet Russia—if anything, it was often worse. 
 That’s true. 
 But one must sort out the facts—for instance, that in Vienna, where there is no Sovietgovernment, you have the same deterioration, to which you can add a moral humiliation a hundred times worse. 
 But the rank and file cannot get this straight. 
 Understand -ably, we are asked: What did we get in the course of these two years? And obviously, dissatisfaction with the old *See pp. 
 212 -13 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 specialists is widespread. 
 Naturally, the question whether we need specialists or not was a salient issue. 
 We shouldn’t forget, however, that without them we would not have hadour army. 
 We would have found ourselves in the same position as Hungary and the Finnish workers. 
 That is how the matter stands. 
 Without these specialists—I spokeabout this in my political report—we would not have been able to take those elementary steps that helped us rise to a definite level. 
 If we had failed to cope with this specialistbusiness, we would not have had this, we would not have been able to make further progress. 
 But now, when we have taken them in hand and harnessed them, when weknow that they will not run away from us, but, on the contrary, are all running to join us, we shall now be sure that democratisation in the Party and the army will rise. 
I shall read further ( reads the resolution ).... 
 Point one ( reads ). 
 * Here there is an addition. 
 Comrade Tomsky said, referring to what we have often spoken aboutourselves, that the rank and file should be brought to the fore, the leaders are tired, give the rank and file a chance. 
 This could not be done at once, but it will be after another,maybe the twentieth, attempt. 
 Failing this, Soviet Russia’s cause would be hopeless. 
 But we know that it is not hopeless, because we have new elements that are growingup. 
 If the first attempts failed, we shall try and try again. 
 Point two ( reads ). 
 * Here a rather sarcastic question was asked as to whether freedom of criticism would correspondto freedom to eat peaches. 
 243 I have one measure as a possible guarantee, on the basis of the proposals made by the committee. 
 At moments when the country is in danger, when Kolchak reached the Volga and Denikin Orel, there can be no freedoms. 
 There are other things than this to beregretted. 
 But the military situation is bad now, too, we see how fickle the fortunes of war are. 
 We must put this question on the order of the day. 
 But we cannot, we mustnot, promise that at moments of military danger we shall not act differently. 
 We shall have to make a tremendous *See p. 
 213 of this volume. 
 —Ed. 
 effort again and no arguing about it, we shall have to stand firm, strain every nerve. 
 We do not renounce this at all, and until we have an Italian victory we must not renounce it. 
 And that’s my reply to the peaches. 
 Point three ( reads ). 
* Here Comrade Preobrazhensky raised a question which Zinoviev raised too: Is regulationappropriate here and what is to be understood by it? I shallleave this question open, as it will be detailed in the committee. 
 We shall see whether regulation is to be understood as detailed points or as the setting up of special bodies. 
 Point four ( reads ). 
 * The speaker here said that this question had been raised by the committee but was rejectedby its majority. 
 I believe I am putting this forward only inmy own name—I believe that it should not be rejected, and if not accepted at once, at least it should first be considered. 
 It has been pointed out here that 500 complaints haveaccumulated in the Orgbureau of the C. 
C. 
 The Orgbureauhas to distribute tens of thousands of people. 
 Besides, there isnot a single member of the Orgbureau who is not swampedwith work, doing several jabs. 
 Under these conditions one has to work with unknown quantities, and under such conditions you can only decide questions by intuition,a thing only experienced people can do, and even theyoften make mistakes. 
 Taking into consideration theseconditions, we want to find people with a length of Partymembership of not less than fifteen years, who enjoy the Party’s trust, who are unbiassed, and who would help in this business, while at the same time standing above theOrgbureau as regards independence, as they would beelected by the congress. 
 I believe this step could be taken. 
To hamper the C. 
C. 
’s work or hold up the decision isimpossible. 
 There is no special provision for it, and we cannot offer it. 
 There used to be a control commission in the German Workers’ Party. 
 How far that will be possible in ourwar situation—one cannot say. 
 In any case we are in aposition to take such a step, and the C. 
C. 
 has taken thatcourse. 
 The C. 
C. 
’s letter says: “Special Party commissions to handle relevant complaints should be organised at all *See p. 
 213 of this volume. 
 —Ed. 
 Gubernia Party Committees and made up of the most dispas -sionate comrades enjoying the general trust of the organisa -tion. 
” It speaks here of dispassionate comrades. 
 For real militant activities—military, economic and organisational—passionate people are very often absolutely necessary,because without high passion they will not be able to workat high pressure, they will not solve the urgent problemfacing the exhausted country. 
 On the contrary, what we need here are people, who though they may not possess conspicuous administrative abilities, have a good knowledgeof life. 
 I doubt whether we shall be able to find enoughof them for the whole of Russia, for all gubernias, and ifthe commissions which are now going to be set up andwhich you will set up under the Gubernia Party Committees prove to be unsuccessful, don’t draw the conclusion that the whole enterprise is a failure. 
 We may not find a sufficientnumber of comrades in the gubernias capable of holdingout from congress to congress. 
 If we don’t find them in thegubernias, we shall find staunch comrades with a knowledgeof life in the centre. 
 I think we should not give up the idea of forming these bodies. 
 It may be said: Where is the guarantee that these bodies can exist? We are in a state of desperate civil war, where,generally speaking, there can be no question of any freedomof broad criticism and so forth. 
 We have other things tothink of, we must strain every effort to end the war. 
 If the conditions of war were not what they are, the position would be different. 
 Under the present conditions we cannot providefor a good many things; and we say straight out that inorder to settle this question in a practical manner we cannotrely on the C. 
C. 
, because it is swamped with work as it is. 
I doubt whether you will find a single C. 
C. 
 member—I judge from my own experience—who doesn’t feel over head and heels in debt as regards unfinished or skimped jobs. 
 I canimagine no more effective guarantee of this plan being carriedout than the creation of this commission, of a group ofcomrades capable of concentrating wholly on this job withthe assurance that it will be entirely independent, handling affairs which no single member of the C. 
C. 
, the Orgbureau, or the Politbureau is in a position to go into with anythoroughness. 
 We may have a practical grasp of things, seeing that we are making some progress, that we have increased our grain collections from 60 to 260 million poods—but this proved insufficient to give us a Red Army that was not overexhausted, to give us workers who did not say,“What good has the Red Army done us, we are starving”,and to give us a leadership that was not utterly worn outand does not stand in need of help from the rank and file. 
Nevertheless, we did make that progress, and that means that even in such a mass state of extreme fatigue the scale of this fatigue is beginning to diminish and we are enteringa period when we can stop discussing the crust -of-bread question and pass on to weightier problems confrontingus, which we all shall most certainly tackle.

 41 2 DRAFT RESOLUTION ON THE IMMEDIATE TASKS OF PARTY DEVELOPMENT Not in lieu of, but as supplementary material to the C. 
C. 
’s letter and the Moscow Committee’s resolution: The indescribably grave position of the Soviet Republic in the early years of its existence, extreme devastation andgrave military danger, made it necessary to designate“shock” (and therefore virtually privileged) departmentsand groups of workers. 
 This was unavoidable, since the ruined country could not be saved unless resources and energies were concentrated on such departments and groupsof workers, without the strengthening of which theimperialists of the whole world would have certainlycrushed us and prevented the Soviet Republic from evenstarting on economic construction. 
 This circumstance, coupled with the heritage of capital -ist and proprietary habits and attitudes, which are so difficult to get rid of, explain the necessity for directing the Party’s attention again and again to the struggle for implementing ... * ... the need for practical guarantees that the decisions of the Party, which is unanimous on the above -mentioned questions of principle, should not remain on paper. 
 Theconference therefore directs the Central Committee imme -diately to resolve, carry out and furthermore propose to thenext congress of the Party that it endorse the following: (1) the absolute obligatoriness of more frequent and wider meetings of Party members parallel with other meas -ures for developing activity among the Party membership; (2) literary organs to be set up, capable of carrying out a more systematic and wider criticism of the Party’smistakes and generally of criticism within the Party (discussion leaflets, etc. 
); (3) precise practical rules to be drawn up on measures for eliminating the existing inequality (in the conditionsof life, size of salaries, and so forth) between specialistsand executives, on the one hand, and the rank and file,on the other—an inequality that violates democracy, is a source of demoralisation within the Party and lowers the prestige of Communists; (4) it shall be found necessary to set up a Control Commis -sion parallel with the Central Committee consisting of themost experienced, unbiassed comrades having the longestParty training and capable of carrying out strict Party control. 
 The Control Commission elected by the congress of the Party should have the right to receive all kinds ofcomplaints and examine them by arrangement with theCentral Committee and if necessary by holding jointmeetings with it or by submitting the question to theParty congress.

 3 PROPOSALS FOR THE RESOLUTION ON THE IMMEDIATE TASKS OF PARTY DEVELOPMENT244 Re the composition of the Control Commission. 
 Adopt resolution of the C. 
C. 
: that we nominate C. 
C. 
 members to the Control Commission only at the desire of the Party conferences, considering it generally incorrect that these C. 
C. 
 members are not bound by the decisions of the C. 
C. 
 in their work within the Control Commission; that C. 
C. 
 members of the Control Commission do not vote in the latter when the matter specially concerns their departments or field of work. 
 As regards transference , add: without detriment to those being transferred familiarisingthemselves with the matter in hand and without detrimentto the work, i. 
e. 
, only in such a manner as ensures that themanagement of affairs remains always in the hands of fully competent workers who guarantee success. 
 Lenin Written September 29, 1920 First published in 1959 Printed from the manuscript in Lenin Miscellany XXXVI REPORT ON THE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL POSITION OF THE REPUBLIC AT A MEETING OF ACTIVISTS OF THE MOSCOW ORGANISATION OF THE R. 
C. 
P. 
 (B. 
) OCTOBER 9, 1920 There is no need to speak of our internal position at this meeting, since all the comrades are sufficiently informedabout this from our press and from work in the local areas. 
 Food collections are much bigger than they were last year so are fuel collections, and these are the foundations ofour work. 
 We are worse off as regards supply, though. 
 Some of the big factories can now be started, and the temper of the workers in them cannot be as hopeless as it was when the factories were at a standstill. 
 Considering our economic situation, we can expect a change of heart. 
 I find it necessary to dwell on our external position, on the news of foreign . 
policy. 
 Poland is in the grip of atremendous crisis: economically, Poland has suffered worsedestruction than we have; politically, things have reached a point when even an opportunist party like the P. 
P. 
S. 
, 245 which has always conducted a vicious smear campaign against the Bolsheviks, protests against the brutal manner in whichthe government deals with the workers. 
 In the territorywhich we are ceding to them under the peace treaty Polandwill be able to rule only by violence. 
 Among the worker and peasant masses of Poland there is a tremendous desire for peace. 
 In offering Poland peace and making tremendousconcessions we shall make the political parties realise thatwe were right, make them realise that we did not wantwar with Poland. 
 By taking indemnities from us, Polandgains nothing. 
 She will not receive the money—France will take it. 
 Up till now this fact has been concealed in Poland, but the position is gradually being brought home to theworkers, and we must see to it that it is brought hometo them still more clearly. 
 Therefore it is necessary thatwe now conclude peace. 
 Besides, we shall win time anduse it to strengthen our army. 
 On the Wrangel front the odds are in our favour, but at one time there was a grave danger to the Donetscoal -field. 
 Wrangel is frustrating our plan of a general offensive by dealing separate blows in various directions. 
 An, at first glance insignificant, incident is characteristic politically. 
 Germany has allowed entry to Comrades Zinoviev and Bukharin to attend the forthcoming congress of the Independent Party in Germany. 
 Maybe this is sheerprovocation, but, on the other hand, there is no doubt thatZinoviev’s arrival will speed up and deepen the split thathad already started among the “Independents”. 
 Part ofthe breakaway “Independents” and up to a million members of the Communist Party of Germany will constitute an imposing revolutionary force. 
 What is more, it will serveas immense propaganda material for all Europe. 
 /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR The crux of the matter is that the imperialist policy of France now stands revealed—of France, who has always upset our peace talks and is now putting spokes in our wheel again. 
 We must make use of every hour of thearmistice to strengthen ourselves. 
 We must step up oursupply activities, achieve quick successes on the Wrangelfront, and then we can hope to tear the web of diplomaticintrigues against us. 
 The situation in the Far East is such that Japan is bound to withdraw, since she cannot possibly face a wintercampaign. 
 This strengthens us. 
 At the present time there isan American multi -millionaire in Moscow, who is negotiating a concession on Kamchatka. 
 By granting this concessionwe shall aggravate relations between Japan and America. 
 In Turkestan and the Caucasus the situation is more complicated. 
 Recently the Turks have started to move onArmenia with the aim of seizing Batum, and afterwards,perhaps, Baku. 
 Obviously we must show the greatest caution in this matter. 
 So far we have no information about military complications. 
 However great the disagreements between France and Britain, we cannot work on them now so long as we are having defeat instead of victory. 
 Apparently, disagreements do exist. 
 Britain wants to trade with us and we are tryingto achieve this. 
 As to how our army is equipped with weapons I cannot say in any detail. 
 There was a shortage of cartridges until recently, but the difficulties now have lessened. 
 The workis on a strong foundation, it only has to be intensified stillmore. 
 The Party organisations must help in this by workingin the Party cells and through the trade unions. 
 As to what the chances are for victory, I cannot say just now, as the general feeling is hard to define at the moment. 
 The disappointment is too great; six weeks have alreadypassed since we started to retreat and we are still retreating. 
The thing is we are late with winter supplies; this hascoincided with the defeat. 
 Without doubt, we must makeuse of every moment of the armistice to strengthen ourselves. 
 We cannot set the tone for agitation until we know something definite. 
 This meeting is already setting the tone. 
 According to Comrade Trotsky the question of Makhno has been very seriously discussed in military circles and it has been ascertained that we can expect nothing but a winning hand here. 
 The reason is that the elements grouped around Makhno have already had experience of Wrangel’s regime, and were not satisfied with what he could give them. 
 Our agreement with Makhno is hedged around with guarantees that he will not go against us. 
 We have the same picture here as with Denikin and Kolchak: as soon as they infringed upon the interests of the kulaks and the peasantry as a whole, the latter sided with us. 
 Unquestionably, the Poles, too, will use the armistice to strengthen themselves; maybe they will bring up munitions during that period, but that does not mean that we should not do the same. 
 So long as there is war, secret diplomacy must exist as a means of warfare. 
 We cannot renounce it. 
 An assessment of this diplomacy depends on a general assessment of the war.

 257 We shall achieve effective implementation of the general plan of economic rehabilitation, which plan, without electrification, is nothing, and talk about “basic tasks”unrelated to this plan would not be serious. 
 For your preliminary information I enclose: 1) A copy of Krzhizhanovsky’s memorandum “ Results of the Work of the State Commission for the Electrification of Russia ”. 
 2) The booklet Basis of Northern Region Electrification Project , of which 3 copies for Trotsky, Rykov and Bukharin I can obtain tomorrow; the rest of the C.

 The internationalbourgeoisie had prevented us from engaging in productivelabour, and all our energies in the course of three yearshad been engaged in war with them. 
 Now we must win a victory on the home front. 
 The bourgeoisie had diverted us from this work. 
 Comrade Lenin spoke about the questionsto be dealt with at the coming congress of Soviets—the questions of transport, agriculture, and so on. 
 He said that all enthusiasm and discipline were to be switched over to the work of peaceful construction and the participation of the rank and file in this job was to be secured. 
 In addition, red tape and officialism had to be combated. 
 Here, too, we had to win a victory, and there was only one way of doing that—by developing the consciousness and activity of the working masses themselves. 
 In conclusion Comrade Lenin expressed the conviction that we would win a victory over cold and hunger.

274 Written December 4, 1920 First published in 1959 Printed from the manuscript in Lenin Miscellany XXXVI REPLY TO THE DEBATE ON CONCESSIONS AT A MEETING OF ACTIVISTS OF THE MOSCOW ORGANISATION OF THE R. 
C. 
P. 
 (B. 
) DECEMBER 6, 1920 Comrades, so many notes have been sent up that I cannot possibly answer them all. 
 On the other hand, most of thearguments have already been refuted in the debate, so I shall first comment on the booklet On Concessions . 
275 I shall deal with this in greater detail. 
 Comrade Lomov’s one-and-a-half page preface deals with the subject all too briefly. 
 Then there is the decree itself of November 23,which sets forth the idea of the interests of world economy. 
“The process of restoring the productive forces of Russia,and at the same time, of world economy as a whole, can beaccelerated many times over by enlisting the co -operation of foreign state and municipal institutions, private enter -prises, joint -stock companies, co -operative societies and workers’ organisations of other countries in the extractionand processing of Russia’s natural resources. 
” Of course,this is merely of propaganda value, but it is economicallyindisputable. 
 World economy has got to be restored. 
 Capitalism acts in such and such a way, and we have our own proposals, but so far world economy remains capitalist. 
 We wanted to attract foreigners. 
 Therefore the end of the decree lists these conditions: Point One: “The concessionaire is to receive reward in the form of a share of the produce stipulated in the agreement with the right of exporting it abroad. 
” Without this they won’t go. 
 The share is not specified. 
 There will be a fightover this, we shall bargain and each of us will try to getthe best of it. 
 Comrades here said we shall have to keepour eyes skinned, and that’s quite right. 
 Point Two: “In the event of special technical improve -ments being employed on a large scale the concessionairewill be granted trade priorities “such as the purchase ofmachinery, special agreements on large orders, etc. 
). 
” Whatdo trade priorities mean? They mean we shall give thisor that firm a priority agreement to the exclusion of anotherfirm. 
 And if the firm takes concessions, we can buy them out, we may pay them extra on the price. 
 The main thing is that we shall be given machines. 
 I think this considera -tion is clear enough, and here again we shall maintainelements of propaganda. 
 Point Three: “Depending on the nature and conditions of the concession prolonged concession terms will be granted to ensure full compensation for the concessionaire’s risk and technical facilities invested in the concession. 
” Herewe have the duration of the concessions. 
 It is quite an indefinite period, and we couldn’t give Kamchatka on any other conditions, and Comrades Fedotov and Skvortsov are right about this being a special concession, which we are granting for important political reasons. 
 In grantingthem under such conditions we are willingly giving awaywhat we do not need ourselves, and we shall be no worseoff for the loss of it neither economically nor politically. 
 Point Four: “The Government of the R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
 guaran -tees that the concessionaire’s property invested in theenterprise shall not be subject to nationalisation, confisca -tion or requisition. 
” Haven’t you forgotten that we stillhave the law court? This is a well -considered phrase with which we were deeply concerned. 
 We wanted to mentionit at first, then thought better of it and decided to say nothing. 
 Speech is silver but silence is gold. 
 There won’t be confiscation or requisition, but there remains the lawcourt, and that court is ours, and if I am not mistaken it iscomposed of people elected by the Soviets. 
 Personally,I hold anything but a gloomy view about our court beinga poor one. 
 So we shall make use of it. 
 Point Five: “The concessionaire shall have the right to hire workers and other employees for his enterprises in theR. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
 with due observance of the code of labour lawsor a special agreement guaranteeing workers definite con -ditions of work that protect their lives and health. 
” Thereis nothing cautious here. 
 If the workers go on strike and that strike is a reasonable one, we shall then be able secretly to support the strikers. 
 What threat do the capitalists use?“We’ll throw you out into the street and you will starve. 
”But here they may find themselves getting a ration fromsomewhere or other, it all depends on us. 
 We can and shallgive it to them. 
 And if the strike is a silly one, unreasonable, we’ll have them up on the Soviet carpet and tell them off good and proper. 
 It speaks here of a special agreement, butit is worded very carefully. 
 By way of exception, however,it will have to be applied to Kamchatka, as we are notin a position to set up any Soviet bodies there. 
 This iswhere Vanderlip was to demand a special agreement. 
 We haven’t even started yet to apply our own laws to Kamchatka. 
 Point Six: “The Government of the R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
 guarantees the concessionaire against any unilateral change in the terms of the concession agreement by any order or decree of the Government. 
” We undertake not to change the terms of the agreement unilaterally, otherwise no one will sign it. 
 This means there must be some go -betweens. 
 Who? The neutral states are all capitalist states. 
 Workers’ organisa -tions? We may have to invite Menshevik workers’ organi -sations. 
 In Western Europe they are in a majority. 
 Maybethe Mensheviks will decide in turn—even number for the Bolsheviks, odd number for the capitalists. 
 But if we don’t come to terms, the agreement may be broken. 
 That dangerremains, but if it is a property agreement there is no harmin that. 
 According to the basic principles of internationallaw this is a private agreement, and you can break it,paying compensation, of course. 
 If you broke it you’ve got to pay. 
 There have been cases in the practice of international law when the ship of another country has been sunk bymistake during the war. 
 It was taken for an enemy ship, butproved to be a neutral vessel. 
 What is to be done? Pay up. 
The same here, as a last resort you buy yourself off. 
 Therestill remains withdrawal from the war, though. 
 War, of course, in the final analysis, is the ultimate argument. 
 Of course, so long as there are capitalists in the world youmust be prepared for war, once you have a socialist state. 
Further, we here are worrying now, but no one has takena concession yet. 
 When certain comrades say, “Ah well,this is the end, they’ll all come crowding in now,” I repeat, it’s possible that no one will care to take it at all. 
 Section One: “Timber concessions in Western Siberia. 
” The Northern Sea Passage is open for shipping, but we haveno merchant fleet. 
 A comrade says representatives havearrived, wishing to receive 6000 dessiatines in checkeredorder. 
 The northern booklet says that if we take the extra electric stations of Petrograd we could use them for taking timber out of the northern districts and develop a productionthat would give us foreign currency to the value of fivehundred thousand gold rubles a year. 
 And total electrifica -tion, according to the estimate of the State Commission,will cost over a thousand million. 
 It is a question whether we shall be able to do it. 
 Concessions, however, will make this task easier. 
 You don’t go about offering concessionsbecause you find life good, and when that life is a hungry one, when you have to wangle things so as to give the people a respite, you have to argue differently. 
 Section Three: “Mining concessions in Siberia. 
” Siberia is fabulously rich in copper. 
 Copper has an extremely highvalue in world economy and is one of the principal metalsused in electrification. 
 We are offering a concession butdo not know who will take it. 
 America or the Germans. 
America will think that if she doesn’t take it, Germany will. 
 When we carry through electrification we shall be a hundred times stronger economically. 
 We shall then speak a differentlanguage. 
 We shall speak about redemption. 
 They knowthat the socialist society is not only quick at creatinga Red Army, but can be quick in other things as well. 
 Further, separate concessions. 
 Three million dessiatines in the European part of Russia alone. 
 Of these, over 800,000 dessiatines in the former Don Cossack Region. 
 There areno state farms or livestock. 
 Whole stanitsas along the riverUral are ruined, splendid virgin lands are lying idle. 
Even if we give away three quarters of the wheat crop raisedthere, we shall receive one quarter. 
 We must strengthen our transport and we can stipulate that tractors be delivered cheaper. 
 If we cannot put three million dessiatines of magnificent land to the plough, which will yield us 100 poods of wheatper dessiatine—then what sort of farming is it? What sortof policy is it? The Italians are interested in this, and Italy is on the eve of a revolution. 
 In Italy the main argument againsta revolution is “We won’t be able to feed ourselves, thecapitalist powers won’t give us any food”. 
 But the socialistpower says, “I have three million dessiatines of land,I have oil and benzine”. 
 You must realise that you can agitate on various planes about capitalism being a dead thing, and that it must be strangled. 
 We have seen a gooddeal. 
 The European is living in the same conditions asthe Russian did when he went towards revolution from theagonies of war. 
 With them the war is over, they are livingby robbing other peoples. 
 All the more weight does this argument carry. 
 They are unable to restore their economy, and we offer them to start restoring it now. 
 We have herecombined a political argument and socialist agitation, but in a different form. 
 You must learn to carry on agitation, otherwise your economic plans will come to nothing. 
 And we are not only agitators, we are a Socialist Republic standing up to all the capitalist states in the world. 
 You can’t run your economy, but we can. 
 There is a possibility of comparison here.

 General reorganisation of the Commissariat for Educa -tion is considered essential, but it should be more thoroughlyprepared, particularly it should be discussed at a numberof meetings in connection with the Congress of Soviets. 
 Exact distribution of functions between the central and local bodies of the Commissariat for Education to be dis -cussed and settled there. 
 4. 
 It is considered necessary in principle to merge the secondary schools (or their higher forms) with technicalvocational training under two indispensable conditions: 1) that general education subjects and communism in the technical vocational schools be extended; 2) that practicalsteps be taken immediately to pass over to polytechnicaleducation, for which purpose use is to be made of everyavailable electric station and suitable factory. 
 The implementation of this reform is to be deferred pending the general reorganisation.

 Written December 20, 1920 First published in 1959 Printed from the manuscript in Lenin Miscellany XXXVI THE EIGHTH ALL -RUSSIA CONGRESS OF SOVIETS DECEMBER ùù-ù9, 19ù0280 1 REPLY TO THE DEBATE ON THE REPORT ON CONCESSIONS DELIVERED TO THE R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
) GROUP AT THE EIGHTH CONGRESS OF SOVIETS DECEMBER 21 Comrades, I have received quite a few notes and shall briefly answer those to which no replies have yet beengiven. 
 But first let me read to you a note of an informativenature, which I think is characteristic: At the Arzamas uyezd congress, Nizhni -Novgorod Gubernia, a non -Party peasant declared the following concerning concessions, which we communicate to you as a characteristic sign: “Comrades, we are dele -gating you to the All -Russia Congress and declare that we, peasants, are prepared to endure hunger and cold and do our duty for another three years but don’t sell Mother -Russia in the form of concessions!” I think it would be very useful to quote this note in the official report to the Congress, * and it ought to be done because it shows a side of the question which the capitalistsoverlook, and in connection with which we have no need whatever to conceal the fact that there is a danger here, and we have to be on our guard against it. 
 I have alreadymentioned that these reminders sharpen the attentionof the workers and peasants. 
 The fact that such remindersare coming from the midst of the illiterate peasantry is ofspecial importance, as it stresses a task which is of excep -*See Vol. 
 31 of this edition, p. 
 493. 
— Ed. 
 tional importance at the present time—I mean about your having to examine the bills tabled in the Council of People’s Commissars for rendering assistance to peasant farming. 
 We must learn to convince the non -Party peasants, win them over to our side and make them self -dependent. 
 A note like this shows that we have every chance of achievingtremendous success here, and we shall achieve it. 
 Here is another note: Won’t the capitalist concessionaires set the proletarian masses against the Soviet government? seeing that the economic crisis and chaos we are living through make it impossible for us to satisfy theneeds of the workers the way the capitalists can? I have said already that in the advanced countries, in most of them, the workers are better provided for than ours, yet the Russian workers in all the advanced countries are all eagerness to come to Soviet Russia, although they arewell aware of the hardships the workers have to bear. 
 Won’t the Russian Ryabushinskys and the rest of the pack put in an appearance together with the English and American capitalists? This has a bearing on the note which asks whether the concessionaires will be exterritorial. 
 Of course not, we shallnever grant them exterritoriality. 
 This is granted only toambassadors, and even then on definite conditions. 
 IfRyabushinsky banks on hiding himself from the proper authorities, I think he is mistaken. 
 Next, comrades, I want to tell you that Comrade Lezhava reports: “Vanderlip has presented a mandate from abouta dozen big syndicates. 
 This has been verified by our specialauthorities here. 
 It has already been corroborated by Krasinin London, who has checked up on the seriousness of the groups for whom Vanderlip is acting. 
” For the benefit of those comrades who ask why the agree -ment has not been published, I repeat that its publicationis not to our advantage, because the capitalists, who arefighting among themselves, think there are far worse thingsin that agreement. 
 The hullabaloo about it in the press bears this out. 
 Let them go on believing it, we have no intention whatever of disillusioning them. 
 Those who wish to famil -iarise themselves with this agreement have every possibil -ity of doing so. 
 Besides, I mentioned that the agreement will come into force after the new president of the United States of America has been sworn in. 
 Our Party congress will be held in February. 
281 Consequently, the Party will have every opportunity of controlling and deciding things. 
 Please explain, if you can, for how long Kamchatka has been let (or is proposed to be let) and is there an economic, apart from a polit -ical, advantage in this for the R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
 and in what form? Kamchatka has not been let and cannot be let until March. 
 The economic gain is that according to the draftagreement they are obliged to give us a share of the mineral wealth which they will extract. 
 In granting concessions do we not thereby admit the durability of the capitalist states and do we not consider our thesis concerningthe earliness of a world revolution to be incorrect? Bukharin has replied to this. 
 It is not a question of our admitting their durability; the point is that gigantic forcesare driving them to the brink. 
 Our existence and speedyrelease from the critical situation and famine are a giganticforce and a factor of revolution more powerful than those farthings—a mere crumb from the point of view of world economy—which they will get from us. 
 An extra hundredor thousand machines and locomotives are of tremendousimportance to us, for it will mean that transport repairs,which Trotsky planned over a period of four and a halfyears and reduced to three and a half, will be reduced by another year. 
 Reducing the economic chaos and famine by a year is of colossal importance to us. 
 What if Japan, to prevent us letting Kamchatka to America, goes and occupies it with her troops and declares it her own? As a matter of fact she is in possession of Kamchatka right now, and if she could she would do it, but she can’tbecause she is afraid of America. 
 Where will the capitalist get his labour force? Will he bring it with him? Hardly. 
 If he is going to employ Russian workers, not only will these be under the thumb of the capitalist, but it will upset our labour market, and this, in turn, will upset our integrated economicplan. 
 I can’t see how our economic plan will be upset by our workers going there to work. 
 They won’t be able to go there apart from the trade unions, apart from our economic organ -isations and our Party. 
 The workers at the advanced capi -talist enterprises will train our workers in the best methods of production. 
 In submitting to capitalist conditions ofwork, our workers will subordinate them to our code oflabour laws or to special restrictive agreements, and willnot hesitate to quit if the conditions are bad, If the condi -tions are unfavourable, the workers will quit. 
 Some comrades are afraid that the conditions will be good, others, that they will be bad. 
 We shall look out, just like our workersand peasants, and take proper measures. 
 In granting concessions, when the concessionaires start working, will the activities of the R. 
C. 
P. 
 in organising communist cells amongthose employed on the concession territory be open or only illegal? Here is a wrong idea of concessions and concessionaires. 
 The concessionaire is not an authority. 
 He does not getany territory other than that to be used for economic ex -ploitation. 
 All government bodies and all courts of lawremain only in the hands of the R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
 Should unemployment in America force a revolution, won’t our concessions be helping America to cope with this crisis, that is, holdup the revolution. 
 That argument has been disproved by Comrade Bukharin. 
 If the international bourgeoisie gets to know of the Soviet govern -ment’s tactics in concessions, what will the position of the Sovietgovernment be? Won’t this be bad for us? On the contrary, everyone in Europe has heard about the concessions, and the hullabaloo about it there only goes toshow that the bourgeoisie is worried. 
 They are anxious notto be late. 
 All those capitalists who do not want to riskhaving dealings with Russia are now beginning to realisethat they are lagging behind while the more enterprising people are getting in. 
 And we are taking advantage of the contradictions among the capitalists. 
 Are there any plans or projects for concessions on large industrial enterprises in Moscow and in the centre generally? There is talk about three such concessions in Moscow, Yaroslavl and Lubertsi. 
 I know nothing about such concessions. 
 There is an American factory in Lubertsi which has not been nationalised and never was, but there is no concession there. 
 The only concession in the centre, which the S. 
E. 
C. 
 comrades have spoken of as being possible, is a concession to the German chemists for developing dye works and letting one factoryto them. 
 In the Council of People’s Commissars all wereagreed it was possible, but this talk has had no practicalconsequences. 
 Germany is so far ahead of our country that during the imperialist war even the advanced countries found them -selves in difficulties when the German chemical industry stopped supplying them. 
 To get our chemical industrygoing we must be prepared to pay the German chemistswell. 
 The best way to learn is to grant the Germans a con -cession on one of our factories. 
 No schools or lectures will help as much as practical work at a factory, where the workers can be trained in six months and then made tobuild another factory like it next door. 
 To fear that theGermans of a single factory will do something to us, con -sidering their international situation, is ridiculous. 
 Therewere no differences of opinion in the C. 
P. 
C. 
 In point of principle it is acceptable. 
 Unfortunately, this question has not had practical results. 
 I must stress the fact that wetalk a great deal about concessions, but so far we have notsucceeded in granting a single one. 
 We shall consider ita great success if we manage to grant at least one, and youwill see the concrete conditions of the concession. 
 Further. 
 What countries can be granted concessions? Can we give a conces -sion to Poland? We believe they can be granted to all countries, Poland included. 
 Couldn’t the capitalists use the concessions to avert crises at home and thus stave off a social revolution? If the capitalists could avert crises at home, then capital -ism would be everlasting. 
 They are decidedly blind pawns in the general mechanism—the imperialist war has shownthat. 
 Every month proves that the crisis of capitalism isdeepening, disintegration throughout the world is spreading farther and farther, and Russia is the only country where an upswing towards a durable and serious improvement has started. 
 To sow dissension among the workers the concessionaires may place their workers in better conditions. 
 This won’t increase dissension among our people, we have grown much stronger. 
 Will trade union groups be organised on the concessionaire’s territory? The concessionaires get economic exploitation, the authorities and laws remain Soviet ones. 
 Can you outline the conditions guaranteeing us against the danger of the Soviet state system being distorted and a capitalist set -up being introduced? These conditions are the laws of the R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
 If a contracting party breaks them we have the right to cancelthe agreement. 
 What is the gist of the tentative draft agreement with the American imperialists covering a concession on Kamchatka? I said that the term of the concession is 50 -60 years. 
 We get a share of the produce, they the right to set up a military and naval base at the inlet near which there is an oil deposit. 
 You say that granting concessions to the capitalists of oppressed countries like Germany is more important than for other countries. 
 But if the capitalists of oppressed countries use the concessions toimprove their country’s economic position, don’t you think this willstave off the revolution in that country? The international situation as regards revolution revolves around Soviet Russia’s struggle against the rest of the world,the capitalist countries. 
 To strengthen Soviet Russia andmake her invincible—that is what matters most as far as the struggle of the oppressed and colonial countries is concerned. 
 What role in concessions does Turkestan cotton play? So far there is no question of granting a concession on Turkestan cotton. 
 This question was not discussed. 
 Will concessions be granted for the rehabilitation of industrial enterprises and for taking over railways? Such exigencies are ruled out. 
 The railways are a single integrated enterprise. 
 Has there been any question of concessions on slaughter -houses? Not that I have heard of. 
 The protests against concessions in the local areas stand clearly revealed, not as healthy sentiments at all, but as patriotic feeling among a strong petty -bourgeois section of the countryside and among the urban middle classes. 
 The patriotism of a person who is prepared to go hungry for three years rather than surrender Russia to foreigners is genuine patriotism, without which we could not hold out for three years. 
 Without this patriotism we wouldnot have succeeded in defending the Soviet Republic, indoing away with private property and now getting as muchas 300 million poods by means of the food surplus -appropria -tion system. 
 This is the finest revolutionary patriotism. 
 As for the kulaks being prepared to go hungry for three years to keep out the foreign capitalists, from whom theyhave something to gain—that is untrue. 
 It is not the kulakswho are concerned, it is the non -Party middle peasant. 
 Isn’t there a risk that in view of a possible war between America and Japan there is a likelihood of a serious attack on Soviet Russiaby Japan? What shall we do then? Shall we fight off Japan in alliancewith imperialist America, using her assistance as a real force? Of course we shall—we have often said that an alliance with one imperialist state against another to consolidate the socialist republic is not objectionable in point of princi -ple. 
 An attack by Japan on Soviet Russia is much more difficult now than it was a year ago. 
 Please explain the Allies’ policy towards Turkey and our relation -ships. 
 It is rather awkward, of course, to deal openly with this question in an official speech, as relations here are extremely confused. 
 Everything here depends on the intri -cate play of relations in bourgeois Georgia, which is on theverge of catastrophe. 
 The comrades who are interested inthis will, I am sure, derive great benefit from the reportby Comrade Meshcheryakov, Editor of Pravda , who has returned from Georgia, where he spent several weeks, if not months, and has collected highly interesting material on this Menshevik realm. 
 Georgia is on the verge of disaster. 
 The Turkish attack was planned against us. 
 The Allies were making a pitfall for us, but fell into it themselves,because we have received Soviet Armenia. 
 The men at the top in Turkey are Cadets, Octobrists, Nationalists, who are prepared to sell us to the Allies. 
 Butthat is an extremely difficult thing to do, because feeling among the Turkish people against the savage oppression by the Allies is running very high, and sympathy towardsSoviet Russia is growing in proportion as we help the inde -pendent Azerbaijan Republic to carry out proper liberationof the Moslem peasants, who have driven out the landowners,but are afraid to take the land, and will shortly stop being afraid; when they do take the land the Turkish landowner won’t last long. 
 We personally have been and will be peaceful in the extreme in the Caucasus, and for the information of ourCaucasian comrades, we shall be very careful to avoidanything that may involve us in war. 
 Our peaceful policy so far has been so felicitous, that the Allies are getting nervous, have started taking decisive steps against us?but are only getting them against themselves. 
 What is going to happen next to Georgia? Even the Mohammedan Allah doesn’t know that, but if we show self -restraint we have something to gain without running any risk. 
 We are asked whether there were any other concession objects besides Kamchatka. 
 There have been no otherconcessions with Vanderlip. 
 Regarding press hand -outs. 
 We can’t do that, first because the printing -works are busy, and secondly so as not to make this material available to people abroad, where there is a desire to torpedo this undertaking of ours. 
 So far wehaven’t got a single concession, a single agreement, and wemust first get an agreement before speaking about dangers. 
We have nothing so far and are acting semi -legally. 
 How will things stand with concessions and with works and build -ings erected by concessionaires in the event of a) their violating the laws of the R.

in accordance with military procedure. 
 The Russian bourgeoisie, who have escaped abroad, will be able to take part in the exploitation of concessions with their capital. 
Won’t this lead to the old bosses coming back under the guise offoreign capital? If an old boss takes a ride through the northern forests of European Russia under the guise of foreign capital wehave nothing to fear. 
 You will find many an old boss in the centre of Moscow. 
 We have a thousand times less reason to fear a situation in which we shall have a list of all visitingforeigners, than those bosses who are operating at our enter -prises and who, unfortunately, have not been registered yet. 
 You have pointed out and underlined the political significance of concessions. 
 That is understandable. 
 But what the provinces aremost worried about is this: with concessions there will be trade rela-tions. 
 What threats and dangers to the Republic does this imply inthe sense of disintegration and the blowing up of the Soviet system from within (perhaps increased profiteering, etc. 
) and what precautions can we take against it? I have already spoken about that. 
 We had a tremendous threat of profiteering in the shape of Sukharevka,282 with which we waged a constant struggle. 
 We understand, ofcourse, that with the abolition of Sukharevka profiteeringstill remains, it remains wherever there is a small proprietor,and we have tens of millions of such proprietors. 
 That iswhere the real danger lies, and not in big capital, which will be hedged around on all sides with special supervisions. 
 It should not be forgotten that we shall have an agreementwhich we can always cancel at the risk—our greatestdanger—of having to pay damages. 
 What is the position with regard to tsarist debts? Will the Allies agree to any transactions unless these debts are paid? England already agrees not to demand the debts from us, since we have proposed the draft of a trade agreement to them. 
 Under that draft trade deals are now starting and under it we are not obliged to repay debts. 
 I say, Englandagrees, but France does not. 
 And so we tell France that in principle we do not refuse. 
 The exact amounts of payments will be discussed at a conference, at which we intend to say: you, too, are responsible for the losses you have caused us by your intervention. 
 An ad hoc commission is workingon this question, and an initial estimate puts the figureat ten thousand million in gold.

) GROUP AT THE EIGHTH CONGRESS OF SOVIETS DURING THE DEBATE ON THE REPORT OF THE ALL -RUSSIA CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE AND THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE’S COMMISSARS CONCERNING HOME AND FOREIGN POLICIES DECEMBER 22 Comrades, allow me to begin by touching on certain remarks made by speakers and answering notes, at least themore important ones. 
 From Comrade Korzinov’s criticismI have picked out the idea concerning engineers and agron -omists. 
 We must push forward with the training of engi -neers and agronomists from among the workers and peasants. 
This is beyond all question, and the Soviet government istaking steps in this direction, but we cannot count on veryquick results; it may not take as long as electrification, butit will take at least several years; so it is wrong of ComradeKorzinov to suggest that all other matters be set aside until we have our own agronomists. 
 Right now we have got to find and get the best agronomists, call them to our meetings,demand from them an account and thus single out theindustrious and educated men from the rest. 
 Comrade Korzinov has landed in the opposition for opposition’s sake when he says that the decree on concessions should have been published earlier. 
 But our work at the Council of People’s Commissars and the Council of Labourand Defence is such that we have to react at once, and the position with us is such that, given no differences of opinion in the C. 
C. 
 and C. 
P. 
C. 
, decisions are taken at once. 
 If the decree on concessions is wrong,283 then we should propose its repeal, because the chief concession with Vanderlipwill not become a formal agreement until next March. 
 At the time we published this decree our main purpose was, and still remains, to conclude a trade agreement asquickly as possible and offer the bait of concessions to the capitalists. 
 I dealt with this political aspect of the case in my report to the R. 
C. 
P. 
 group and heard no objectionsat the time. 
 I was therefore surprised when Comrade Ignatov,bent on being opposition -minded, said that we had slipped up on Vanderlip, that we hadn’t found out who he was. 
I read the statement by the Deputy People’s Commissar for Foreign Trade that all inquiries concerning the group Vanderlip represented had been made, had been confirmedabroad and remained unrefuted. 
 Vanderlip himself hadpointed out that no agreement could be concluded untilafter the presidential elections, when the Republican candi -date would take office, since such an agreement would have to be sanctioned by the American Government. 
 This is an agreement under which the American Govern -ment is to receive a naval base. 
 Consequently, even if thisWashington Vanderlip, about whom Comrade Ryazanovwent into such irrelevant details—as often happens withhim—even if he did represent nobody and was just a swindler and the proposed agreement was to provide for the Govern -ment of the United States receiving a naval base aimed against Japan, there could be no question of our being swindled,as the President of the United States would really be a mem -ber of the Republican Party. 
 After Vanderlip we shall bein a position to form a conclusive opinion about this trade agreement. 
 Ignatov’s entire criticism falls to the ground; he simply did not pay attention to what was said at ourmeeting. 
 Comrade Korzinov said that in the matter of Poland we should have given warning earlier. 
 We have here anextremely difficult situation, and there was a moment when our troops were on the move and the Central Committee had reason to believe that despite the complicated situationwe could achieve much by launching an offensive. 
 At such a time when, after Curzon’s Note of July 11,284 w e had to give a reply within a few days, how could we be expected to call Party meetings to discuss the matter? Besides, every comrade knows that if we could have passedover to an offensive war at the right moment we wouldhave done so without hesitation. 
 And there would neverhave been any opposition to it anywhere. 
 What we didsee was an opposition in reverse, when we were accused of not pursuing a sufficiently active foreign policy. 
 That there have been mistakes here, there is no doubt, but neitheris there any doubt that arguing about them would be a sheerwaste of time, as we have other things to think of besidesour old activities. 
 When time has receded, when all thedocuments and material will have been collected, we shall be able to fully appreciate our mistake. 
 Therefore, I see nothing, absolutely nothing, in Comrade Korzinov’s speechother than a desire to seek opposition. 
 At another time, whenwe are in more favourable conditions, we shall make thesame use of our successes. 
 And so long as the Party doesnot forbid it, we shall always assume the offensive. 
 I don’t think that the Party or any of its members will propose a reverse policy at any meeting. 
 In regard to Comrade Gusev’s remark, I must say that I made a mistake in introducing polemics in an officialreport, and therefore I have already suggested that thispart of the report be deleted from the official text and greet -ings to Soviet Armenia added—through an unforgivableoversight on my part this was omitted in the report. 
 Comrade Gusev is wrong in saying that I boasted of my modesty—the point is that in passing over to a more seriouspractical integration of the economic commissariats andthe implementation of a single economic plan, the thing we had to be afraid of was project -mongering. 
 Comrade Gusev says that I did not criticise his booklet285 as a whole. 
 But that is the central point: Comrade Trotskyand Comrade Rykov are invited to drop the departmentsand join the Council of Defence, which, not being a depart -mental body, will set up a new apparatus of its own I cannot understand how, after three years of Soviet rule, one can raise and support such a question here. 
 I am at a loss forwords to express my perplexity. 
 It is so ill -advised, it means knocking down the department in one place and setting it up in another. 
 It means failure to understand what our apparatus is. 
 I don’t know whether Comrade Popov has managed to print the leaflet he gave me. 
 It contains anextract from the 1920 census results. 
 You know that thiscensus has been satisfactorily carried out and has yieldeda mass of valuable information concerning the number ofSoviet office employees in Moscow. 
 We took a similar census before this in 1919, but now we have a fuller one. 
 It shows that we have no less than 230,000 office employees,of which 30,000, or even more, are in the most importantcommissariats, and 70,000 in the Moscow Soviet. 
 286 Try to imagine these figures, ponder over them, and then youwill say to yourself—well, if you take an influential man, one who enjoys the greatest authority and has created a certain style of work in his department, take him out ofthat department and put him in charge of several uniteddepartments, you can expect nothing but chaos. 
 Is that theway to fight bureaucratism? It is simply a frivolous attitudetowards the work, absolutely unrealistic. 
 I understand what a serious thing bureaucratism is, but no provision for its abolition is made in the Party Programme. 
 It is not aproblem for a congress, it is a problem for a whole epoch,and you have a special report devoted to this question. 
 Does anyone really believe that by a mere stroke of the pen, by taking comrades, who have created the best form of organisation in one or another of the most important departments, and transferring them to the Council ofLabour and Defence, you will be getting a new departmentwith indefinite powers that will not perform economicallyunifying functions. 
 When the practical question arosein the Council of Labour and Defence as to what was econom -ic and what was not, not only the Foreign Trade Commis -sariat, but the Finance Commissariat as well claimed thatit was an economic commissariat. 
 And can you conductany economic work without the Commissariat for PublicHealth. 
 Of course, when we shall have made big progressin economic reconstruction the relation of economic commis -sariats to non -economic ones may become different after we have achieved important successes in the work of changingour economic foundations. 
 At present we have nothing of the kind. 
 Therefore, to treat the departmental question as lightly as Gusev does—in other parts of the booklet, by the way, he repeats some of the excellent ideas expressed in his previous booklet287—is absolutely wrong. 
 I shall say nothing about Ryazanov’s speech, which has been sufficiently refuted by Kamenev. 
 I shall merely mentionthat both Ryazanov and Gusev, who has followed his badexample, have been talking about having heard, perhaps from me in the Council of People’s Commissars, that I wanted to, one said drown myself, the other said shootmyself. 
 If comrades are going to take a man at his angryword, uttered when he is very tired, and make him speakabout it before an audience of a thousand, I don’t thinkthese people can expect their speeches to be taken seriously. 
 (Applause . 
) It’s quite possible that we have a lot of vermicelli affairs in the Council of People’s Commissars—that’s true. 
 IfMaximovsky has made this an object on which to displayhis oppositionist bent and made a special point of it, I mustsay there is not and cannot be any government institution which does not have to deal with vermicelli affairs. 
 You omitted to mention that the C. 
C. 
 dealt with questions involv -ing policy. 
 So long as the ruling Party governs, so longas this Party has to decide all questions concerned withvarious appointments, you will not allow important stateappointments to be made by anyone but the ruling party. 
 When all is said and done, the question of who is to make this or that policy is of secondary importance. 
 Hasn’t theC. 
C. 
 vermicelli affairs? Plenty of them. 
 Aren’t there agendas,on completing which and running through a dozen itemsof business, you would not only say you’d be glad to drownyourself, but something worse still. 
 I repeat, to catch me at this sort of statement is not very difficult, but to come out here and make it an object for an oppositionist stand andspeak against vermicellism is frivolous. 
 If, in a body which in general establishes only principles, we attempted to set up a separate body to deal with petty,practical, vermicelli affairs, we would only make things worse. 
 Because we would be tearing generalisation away from the facts of life, and such a break would be sheer day -dreaming and frivolity. 
 Questions in the Central Committee cannot be divided into questions of principle and trivial questions, because in every trifle a principle may be involved. 
 It is not a question of Ivan or Sidor. 
 It is not a question of putting Sidor in Ivan’s place or vice versa. 
 What ifthey refuse? What if this Ivan and Sidor are both people’scommissars—what’s to be done then? The C. 
C. 
 has a Secretar -iat, an Orgbureau, a Politbureau, finally, plenums of theCentral Committee are held, and very often questions come before the Central Committee Plenum that are as trivial and tedious as anything, and some that you sit over forseveral hours until you feel like drowning yourself. 
 Butto draw a line between trivial questions and questions ofprinciple is to undermine the very foundation of democraticcentralism. 
 At the same time it cannot be said that the Central Committee dumps its vermicelli onto other insti -tutions. 
 So far we have not been able to alter the Constitution and have been working autonomously. 
 The fact that on somequestions we have arrived at an agreement and on othersthere have been debates is only natural and inevitable,considering the apparatus we have. 
 The fact that the C. 
C. 
 is becoming an organ of control, and that in the general distribution of work it has fallen to Comrade Kalinin tosupervise agitation and verification, and that he is requiredto give his personal impressions obtained during his tripsand at work—this gives no grounds for shouting about theCouncil of People’s Commissars referring all questions to the C. 
C and vice versa. 
 It means introducing further confu -sion and turmoil while things remain essentially unchanged. 
 The higher bodies are needed for the purpose of controland for turning down certain questions. 
 People here have spoken and complained about the Presid -ium of the All -Russia Central Executive Committee being swamped with business, and though it is our highest body, it is swamped with purely vermicelli affairs. 
 But I wouldask all those present here, how many of you have read a dozenreports of our proceedings? Who has read them from begin -ning to end? Probably no one, because they are dull, youcan’t wade through them. 
 I must say that every member of our Party and every citizen of the Republic has a right to bring any question, any circumstance, however trivial,before the All -Russia Central Executive Committee. 
 This question will go through the whole ladder, through the bureau, etc. 
 till it gets to the C. 
E. 
C. 
 Presidium, where it will be examined. 
 And so it will be until the complete communist re -education of the working people, which will come within several decades after electrification has beenfinally completed. 
 In this respect we are not afraid of changes. 
 I shall now deal with some of the notes. 
 Comrade Minkin writes: Did Comrade Shlyapnikov inform the Council of People’s Com -missars of the disgraceful goings on at the Commissariat for Foreign Trade, or was this being kept for announcement at the Congress? If hedid make such a statement, what has been done to eliminate them? To answer this question I consulted Comrade Serebryakov who is better informed than I am. 
 He was appointed by the Central Committee to the commission, the other members of which were Dzerzhinsky, Krestinsky and Lezhava, setup to take steps towards improving the relations betweenthe Commissariat for Foreign Trade and the Commissariatfor Internal Affairs, since our representatives abroad hadinformation that these relations were anything but satis -factory. 
 At my request Serebryakov gives the followinganswer to the note of delegate Minkin: “Comrade Minkinstates...” ( reads ). 
 After this commission a subcommission was set up. 
 It is very easy to play at opposition, since there are disgracefulgoings on with us in every commissariat, and the infelicitous mention of guarantees and 30,000 employees in the commis -sariat’s technical publishing house is very characteristic in the sense that you can always find scandalously disgracefulthings here. 
 You will find the same thing in any divisionof the Red Army. 
 Nevertheless our Red Army has beenwinning victories all the time. 
 The thing is to apply in good time to the institution that has to remedy matters, and not talk about it here, wherewe cannot collect accurate information about what ComradeRyazanov has heard of this or that person and has notchecked it or discovered the true facts. 
 Is that democraticcentralism? It is not at all democratic, and not at all centralism, but disorder and the introduction of chaos. 
 Complaints should be lodged with Party bodies. 
 If that body does not fulfil its duty it should be made to give a strict account of itself. 
 Among the notes that have been sent up there is the question of reducing the army. 
 On this subject ComradeTrotsky will make a special statement, and you will decidewhether this question should be dealt with today or at thenext special meeting of the R. 
C. 
P. 
 group. 
 I can tell you thatafter an ad hoc commission on demobilisation headed by Trotsky and Dzerzhinsky was set up, the C. 
C. 
 decided to start demobilisation, and this is now going on. 
 It is beingdealt with by the military department, and you will receivean exact report. 
 Is the Council of Labour and Defence regarded as an interim body called upon to unite the economic commissariats and then to beabolished, or is it the basis of a future integrated economic plan?Also, on what apparatus does the Council rely locally? This question has not been settled, and we believe that to raise it now would be a waste of time. 
 The order of theday now is a check -up of the organisation of the commis -sariats. 
 The Council of People’s Commissars has set up anorganisational body which is to revise the apparatus of thePeople’s Commissariats with a view to the tasks confronting them, and in this connection, to examine the question of staffs. 
 To busy ourselves at the present time with settingup another apparatus in place of the Council of Labour andDefence is impossible until the question of electrificationis settled. 
 Various material on electrification will soonbe handed out to you, and the Council of Labour and Defence will have to reckon with what the verification of this mate -rial and the reports will have to say. 
 We now have an organ that we need, and, good or bad, we have in any case beenworking with it and coping with the tasks confrontingus. 
 We have no intention of embarking on reforms untilwe have practically tested how the integrated economic plan will be carried out. 
 This is definitely a case of look before you leap. 
 Who is going to conclude concession contracts in the Far East we or the buffer state, in either case—why? This, comrades, is a delicate question. 
 Buffer state288— it is such an embarrassing definition when we are asked: You or the buffer? On the one hand we have the buffer, on the other, the corresponding Party Bureau of the R. 
C. 
P. 
 The buffer’s a buffer, it’s to enable us to win time and then beat the Japanese. 
 I don’t know whom Kamchatkabelongs to. 
 Actually the Japanese are in possession, andthey do not relish the idea of our giving it away to theAmericans. 
 We are consulted, our directives are compliedwith, and nobody has protested against our negotiations with Vanderlip, no single group of Party comrades has considered the question important enough to demand itsbeing discussed at the plenum of the Central ExecutiveCommittee and examined in the Control Commission. 
This is the right of every Party member, and no one hasused this right. 
 The person who has learned the facts which led to the postponement of an agreement till March will not try to make use of this right. 
 What is your view of the trade unions at the present moment in connection with the concessions? Is it true that you stand for the organisation of a trade union of peasants? I must say that the Party’s Programme mentions the necessity of seeking new forms of trade unions that wouldunite the poor sections of the peasantry. 
 289 This task has been posed in the Party’s Programme and I have oftenpointed out that although we are not in a position at presentto solve this problem, we must not give it up. 
 We must not confine ourselves to the work of Vserabotzem, 290 which is so weak, and which cannot give us outstanding workers. 
So long as we have a levelling process taking place amongthe peasantry, a levelling and unification of the workingpeasants, the non -kulak section of the peasantry, this problem cannot be removed from the order of the day of socialist construction. 
 To strengthen the work of the trade unions we must extend them not only to the rural proletariat,but to all the working peasantry. 
 How this is to be donewe do not know yet. 
 We have set this task in the Party’sProgramme, we shall return to it many times and get itsettled in a practical manner from different aspects. 
 That is all I can say now on this question. 
 With the granting of concessions, the trade unions, natu -rally, will have important tasks imposed upon them—those /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR of checking, supervising, and maintaining contact with the workers who will be employed in these concessions. 
 How this task will be handled in practice, I cannot say at the moment. 
 To raise this question at the present time wouldbe inadvisable, as the trade unions have more importanttasks facing them. 
 In our fight against bureaucratism we certainly need the help of the trade unions. 
 We must rely on them. 
 This is basically provided for in the Party’s Programme. 
 291 This shows what a long struggle is needed and what systematicwork faces us. 
 When we shall have data that in such -and-such a workmen’s settlement the business of supervision is organised in such -and-such a way and definite results have been achieved, while in such -and-such a block, uyezd, etc. 
 things are different—then we shall be able to weigh things, get them moving, and there will not only be talkabout the “agitpotato” but we shall be in a position tocheck what steps have been taken in practice and on thisground apply practical measures that have already yieldedresults.

 42 3 SPEECH ON ADDENDA TO THE BILL OF THE C. 
P. 
C. 
 “ON MEASURES TO CONSOLIDATE AND DEVELOP PEASANT FARMING” DELIVERED TO THE R. 
C. 
P. 
 GROUP OF THE EIGHTH CONGRESS OF SOVIETS DECEMBER 27 Comrades, the Central Committee today has examined the decision adopted by the group concerning the deletionof the words “individual householders” from the point ofthe resolution on agriculture which deals with improvement and premiums. 
 The C. 
C. 
 has passed the following resolution and authorised me to defend it. 
 292 (Reads . 
) There, comrades, you have the text of the C. 
C. 
’s decision. 
 Allow me now to give the reasons why we simply could not agree with the group’s decision. 
 We had no doubts, and this was parti -cularly stressed at the C. 
C. 
 meeting, that the principalreasons the group was guided by in its decision to rejectthe idea of premiums for individual householders werethe fear that we would give premiums to the kulak, andthe desire to give priority to the village commune, thevolost, the collective unit—to common labour, not the individual. 
 With this we are in perfect agreement. 
 We con -sider, however, that it would be wrong to let ourselves reject altogether the idea of premiums for individual farmersfor reasons, which in themselves are quite correct, fundamen -tally indisputable to any Marxist and especially valuablefrom the point of view of the peasantry. 
 Allow me to give you some information from the history of the origin of this bill. 
 I have been following its progressthrough the Council of People’s Commissars fairly closelyand must say that in the first draft, tabled by the FoodCommissariat, the main accent, generally speaking, wason the hardworking farmer. 
 The gist of Comrade Sereda’s proposals was that it would be wrong to stake on the hard -working farmer, and that we should stake on the village commune, the collective body. 
 The Council’s attitude onthis question—at least, mine—was that we had to weighall the pros and cons and consult the local people. 
 Indeed,it seemed wrong to me to reject premiums for individual farmers, but that the village commune had to be given priority—this might be all right if the local people withpractical experience confirmed that it could and shouldbe done. 
 From this conflict of two points of view thereemerged the formulation that was adopted for the bill ofthe Council of People’s Commissars, namely, that both be retained and a ratio established between the two kinds of premiums. 
 The details, as defined in the Council, wereto be covered by instructions. 
 In fact the decision of theCouncil says that the instructions are to be drawn up withina definite stated period by the Commissariat for Agriculture,co -ordinated with the Commissariat for Food and endorsed by the Council of People’s Commissars. 
 As an exception to the general procedure, when instructions are endorsedby a single order of the People’s Commissar concerned, we arranged not only for verification—the participation of two People’s Commissars—but specially added that the Council of People’s Commissars demanded that the instruc -tions be submitted to it for endorsement. 
 Obviously, a great deal depended on the instructions. 
 After certain explanations given by comrades your decision not to give premiums to individual farms became clear to us. 
The Central Committee saw the point. 
 The point is fear of unfair premiums, the giving of premiums to kulaks. 
 Obviously, the best -run farms are those of the well -to-do peasants and the kulaks, and there are still plenty of thesein the villages, on that score we haven’t the slightest doubt. 
If we, in paying a premium for an efficient farm, did nottake care to find out how that efficiency was achieved, then, naturally, the kulak would prove to have the best -run farm. 
 And if we ignore the question as to how, at whatprice, economic improvement is achieved, we shall findthe kulak receiving unfair privileges. 
 If we reward himwith the means of production, that is, with things thatmake for farm expansion, we shall find ourselves indirectly, and perhaps even not quite indirectly, boosting the kulaks, because, in rewarding an industrious farmer without con -sidering whether or not he achieved his good results by kulakpractices, and what is more, rewarding him with things likethe means of production, that is to say, things he can useto strengthen his influence with, we shall, of course, be running counter to the basic provisions of not only the agrarian, but of all Soviet policy, and infringing the basicprinciple—that of supporting the interests of the workingpeople against those of the kulaks. 
 In doing so we shallreally be seriously undermining the principles and founda -tions of all Soviet policy in general, and not only of agrarian policy. 
 But if we are to draw from this the conclusion that indivi -dual farmers should not be rewarded, then take the followingexample: we give bonuses to individual workers at factoriesand mills, where collective, socialised, labour has reachedan incomparably higher level than in agriculture. 
 What is to be done about the peasantry then? In a peasant coun -try, where individual peasant labour predominates to the extent of nine -tenths, probably ninety -nine per cent, where we have twenty million peasant farms, we want to promote these farms and we must do so come what may. 
 We know that their efficiency can be raised only after several long years of radical technical reform. 
 We have learned somethingin our three years of practical work. 
 We know how to buildup the foundations of communism in agriculture—thiscan be done at the cost of a tremendous technical evolution. 
We clearly visualise that elaborated plan with located electric stations, we know the minimum -programme, the programme for the next ten years, but in this book on electri -fication we also have a maximum -programme, in which gigantic work is planned for years ahead. 
 But now we havetwenty million separate farms, which are run separatelyand cannot be run in any other way; and if we don’t encourage them to raise productivity this would be grossly wrong, it would be clearly overdoing it, it means a refusal to seefacts of reality that strike the eye, facts that we have toreckon with and be guided by. 
 It would be desirable, ofcourse, to have these farms rise through collectivism, bywhole volosts, communes, etc. 
 But how far that is possible at present is a thing we have to reckon with. 
 If you, working in the local areas, support progress in this direction andraise a whole commune or a whole volost—all the better;in that case give them all that is best in premium payments. 
But are you sure that you will manage it, that it is notsheer fantasy, which in the practical work will lead to the greatest blunders? That is why we propose to you the last part of the C. 
C’s resolution reworded or amended as the practical workersmay deem fit for inclusion in the resolution of the Congressof Soviets, so that this question should be decided by youand you should say here: premiums and rewards for individ -ual farmers are acceptable under three known conditions. 
First, premiums for rural communes first and foremost,with householders coming second and receiving whatremains—to this we agree. 
 The second point says individualfarmers who have achieved economic success by kulakpractices should not be rewarded; it should not be a case of—you have made a go of it economically, you are to be rewarded. 
 If anyone has achieved economic success, butemployed a kulak method in doing so, whether in the form of a loan, the hiring of labourers, or profiteering—kulak practices sometimes dodge the law—if anyone has employed the slightest kulak method to achieve success, he is to forfeit reward of any kind. 
 This is the second restrictionwhich goes still further to meet your principled pointof view as to combating the kulaks and supporting the Workingmiddle peasants and poor peasants. 
 The third restriction—what is to be issued as premiums. 
 They may be given in the form of means of production—things like implements and machines that serve to expand and improve the farm;articles of consumption may be issued, household articlesof adornment, things that make the home brighter andlife more beautiful. 
 We say: “Give the individual farmersonly consumer and household goods, and, of course, medals. 
” You have already accepted the Order of the Red Banner. 
 293 As to the means of production, these may be given to individual farmers, but of such a type and on such conditionsthat they should not be usable for kulak purposes. 
 Nomachines should be given, not even to the most hardworkingfarmer, not even if he has achieved success without the least resort to kulak practices. 
 Machines should not be given, because by the very nature of their employmentthey require collective labour, and a farmer who receivesa machine will not be able to use it by himself. 
 These are the considerations the C. 
C. 
 was guided by and on the basis of which we have asked you to reconsider your decision, exchange opinions, and alter your decision if you deem it possible so as to allow individual farmers to berewarded on the three conditions set forth above. 
 If we donot accept this, we may not achieve needed results, sincefarm improvements cannot be carried out in a tired andruined country without a special effort, and the hardworking farmers have to be rewarded. 
 All hard work that contains no element of kulak practices should be rewarded. 
 That iswhy we think that on considering these reasons you willagree to premiums subject to the three restrictive conditionsmentioned above, which we think are really necessary inthe interests of our economic development.

C. 
P. 
 GROUP OF THE EIGHTH CONGRESS OF SOVIETS DECEMBER 27 Before answering the notes it must be stated definitely whether a formal difference of opinion exists between the congress group and the Central Committee. 
 Dealing with what the first speakers have said here: we adopted a definitedecision, intending to fight the kulaks, but at that timeyou did not have the methods of struggle outlined by us inthe three addenda. 
 What did the comrades who opposedthese addenda say here? As a matter of fact they said nothing. 
 The peasant Red Armyman who spoke here 294 said that the kulaks exist and they are growing, but we say definitely:if they are kulaks they will receive no reward. 
 You arebeing asked to make that a law. 
 Moreover, if the middlepeasant achieves betterment individually, but may useit to become a kulak, he is not to receive a premium. 
 What argument, then, has been advanced here against our reasons? None at all. 
 It is reiterated that the kulak should not berewarded. 
 But we agree to that. 
 I shall deal now with the notes that have been sent up. 
 The first one: 1) What will be the criterion for a “hardworking kulak” and a “hardworking middle peasant”? 2) If we do find that criterion here and work out a plan, how are we going to carry it out locally, all the more in places where the kulaksare still playing the leading role? 3) Where is the line to be drawn between rewarding a whole col-lective body and an individual farmer, or are both of them to be re -warded? For one thing, the peasants know this better than we do. 
 If the law bans any reward for people employing kulakpractices, then this is broader than the notion of the kulak. 
 The kulak is a man who generally uses kulak methods, and one or another kulak method is used by almost everymiddle peasant. 
 That means we not only forbid premiums being given to kulaks but to any middle peasant as well, if he uses kulak methods, and these methods are endless in their variety. 
 That crude method by which an extra horse was bought for five poods is not the only one. 
295 Would a premium be given to a kulak like that? What makes you think that people in the country will close their eyes tothis? As to the criterion for a hardworking kulak and a hard -working middle peasant, the local people know this perfectlywell. 
 We have no intention of writing a law about this,as it would mean writing a whole volume describing kulak practices, and people locally know this perfectly well. 
 Secondly, haven’t we got uyezd committees of the Party, won’t this thing be handled by the rural commune, by thevolost land departments, by the Party cell? How can wespeak about fighting the kulaks in the local areas if there areno fighting cells there? This argument is beyond me. 
 Thirdly, the law says that priority is given to the collective body with the individual farmer coming second. 
 Thedifferentiation will be made in greater detail by the UyezdParty Committee and all the other bodies that exist locally. 
 The second note: In introducing its amendment does the C. 
C. 
 regard it as a political act, an incentive to the “hardworking peasants” to improve farmingand industry in general so as to make it easier in the course of time to introduce collective cultivation? Will you please answer this? In the first place, here is proof that there is nothing specially political in this question, something that shouldbe kept from the non -Party peasants. 
 Therefore I consider it quite right and think it should be made a custom to invite non -Party people to our group meetings on such questions. 
 They will have no right of decision at the groupmeetings, but why not consult them? Our economic practicehas shown that it is advisable to go over from individualto collective labour, but having experienced what this going means, we should not try to take it in our stride, but try to understand the need for doing it, the slower the goingthe better. 
 The third note: I think the advocates of commune premiums ought to be asked whether they have enough ploughs and other implements to rewardthe commune with or not. 
 If not, it’s not worth talking about. 
 This argument is incorrect. 
 Generally speaking, we have few articles usable as premiums, and so few ploughs that, as means of production, we shall not give them to individuals, but only to whole communes. 
 But why should we not, if we can, give a plough to a peasant who has worked hard to raise productivity? And who is to decide whether he is akulak element or not? We must lend an ear to what peoplesay lower down. 
 The next note: Will you please, if possible, answer the following question right now on the back of this note. 
 The Svyatiye Kresty Uyezd, Stavropol Gubernia, where I work, has had 10,000,000 poods of grain imposedon it for delivery by December 1, 1920. 
 We have delivered 3,200,000poods. 
 Owing to poor fulfilment we are widely practising confiscationof property from kulak elements, and so l ask you again, will you pleasetell us what we are to do? Should we carry out confiscation, or do it only as a last resort, so as not to ruin the farm? This has no relation to the law we are discussing. 
 Go on acting the way you have been doing. 
 In strict conformitywith the decree of the Soviet government and your own communist conscience go on freely acting the way you have been doing till now. 
 The next note: How is the “hardworking kulak” to be distinguished from the con -cept of “hardworking peasant”? Our bill covers all that, and your asking this is an abuse of question time. 
 Next we are asked: Who can define a hardworking peasant and how, say in any village? If this is to be done by elected or authorised persons in the village,it will mean an abuse of elected and authorised persons. 
 I have already said that we must make use of our Party. 
 We have the Committees of Poor Peasants, and in the Ukraine we have their counterpart. 
 1) Please consider this. 
 Peasant farmers were given a premium for delivering hemp in 1920. 
 They received 100 arshins of textileseach, but the village poor haven’t received an arshin yet for 1920. 
 2) Is the fact taken into consideration that the system of pre-miums to individual farmers is an obstacle in the way of setting upcollective farms and partly bolsters up the shaken foundations ofcapitalism in agriculture? Comrades, you know that individual peasant farms with us are the foundations of capitalism, in a manner of speaking. 
 There is no doubt about that, and I pointed this out in my report, when I said straight out that the “Sukharevka” we had to fear was not the one that existed on Sukharevka Square or existed secretly on any other square, but the onethat sits in the breast of every individual peasant farmer. 
 * Can we get away from this in a year or two years? We cannot. 
But farming has to be improved right now. 
 You are guidedby excellent communist motives, but you want to jump from this floor to that top, and we say—it won’t work, act more carefully and gradually Further: Why don’t the Food Commissariat and other institutions give food products for bonuses to workers of Group 3? I don’t know why, but I should imagine it’s because we have terribly little food products available for bonus payments. 
 Will you kindly answer this question: What does the C. 
C. 
 of the R. 
C. 
P. 
 think of the idea of rewarding the more well -to-do peasants, i. 
e. 
, those who have large allotments which they work themselves?And at the same time, how do the land-poor peasants stand who have no chance of giving a good account of themselves because they have so little land? Why does he have a large allotment? If it is unfair, why does the commune or the Land Department let him keep it?Because others are not able to cultivate it. 
 So why punishhim, if he works hard on it? If he uses kulak methods, don’tlet him do it, if he holds the allotment unfairly, take itaway from him and give it to others, to those who will work it, but don’t blame a man for having a lot of land. 
 In Russia there is no private property, the land is distributed by youyourselves and by the commune. 
 In Russia there are peoplewho have large amounts of land. 
 If the Party committee andthe Soviet bodies see this and do nothing about it, theyshould be given the sack, but people should not be deprived of their premiums. 
 Two more notes. 
 The first: Will this point of the bill apply to the Ukraine? *See p. 
 247 of this volume. 
— Ed. 
 I think it will, and I very much regret that not a single one of the comrades working in the Ukrainian Poor Peasants’ Committees has spoken here. 
 I think the premature closing of the debate a great mistake. 
 The second one: If the R. 
C. 
P. 
 congress group rejects the resolution of the C. 
C. 
 shall we be worthy members of the R. 
C. 
P. 
 or just showing ourobstinacy? My answer to this note is a document called “Rules of the Russian Communist Party”. 
 In Clause 62 of this documentwe read: “On matters relating to its inner life and currentwork the group is autonomous. 
” 296 This means that all members of the group have the right and are bound to vote according to their conscience and not on the instructions of the C. 
C. 
 If, in voting according to your conscience, you passa second decision against the C. 
C’s proposal, we are obliged,on the basis of Clause 62, to summon the Central Committee,and we shall do so at once, and you will send your representa -tives to attend its meeting. 
 A serious question like this were best discussed two or three times to iron out serious differ -ences of opinion between us. 
 That is how matters stand, that is how we have to act. 
 You have to vote now, not because thehigher Party body has issued directives, but because youhave either been persuaded or you have not. 
 Comrades here were wrong to say that things must have been in a poor way if Lenin has been sent to speak up for them. 
 This is not true. 
 The Party Rules define your rightsexactly. 
 That’s one thing. 
 Secondly, it isn’t true becausethere was not a single difference of opinion on this questionin the Central Committee, which said outright: We have beencarried away by our struggle against the kulaks and have forgotten measure. 
 Let us remind people about measure. 
 The C. 
C. 
 appointed two comrades because these two members of the C. 
C. 
 had occasion, during the discussion ofthe bill, to take a more active part in it than others andspoke in the debates: I handled all the drafts, and so didPreobrazhensky. 
 That’s why the two of us were appointed.

 The primary economic tasks, especially those which have to be carried out in the near future, in the course of 1921, are to be elaborated by the General Planning Commission or its subcommission in the greatest possible detail, full account being taken of prevailing economic conditions. 
 Written Februar y 17, 1921 Firs t publishe d in 1932 Printe d from the manuscript in Leni n Miscellan y XX SPEEC H AT A MEETING OF MOSCO W PARTY ACTIVISTS FEBRUAR Y 24, 1921310 I am rather surprised at the nature of today’s talk. 
 I don’t think this is the right political moment for it. 
 We have to cope with the present situation, which has deteriorated both internally and internationally. 
 Peace with Poland has not yet been concluded, and at home we have a growth ofbanditism and kulak revolts. 
 As for food and fuel, thingshave gone from bad to worse. 
 Last year we consumed 15million poods of grain during the first half -year and 8 million in the second; this year we have used 25 million poods in the first half -year and are now obliged to cut the bread rations and are not even sure we shall be able to issue them regularly. 
 Obviously our mistake was that we wrongly distributed thegrain in the first half -year; we should not have increased its consumption to 25 million poods. 
 There are no deliveriesfrom Siberia now, because the kulak rebels have cut off the railway. 
 Our Siberian comrades spoke of the possibility of *See Lenin Miscellany XX , p. 
 24. 
— Ed. 
 a kulak uprising, but it is very difficult to determine the extent of it. 
 It is not a war, in which one can weigh the forces engaged in it. 
 The Siberian peasantry are not yet used to privations, although they are bearing less than thepeasantry of European Russia, and there is now a break offin communications with Siberia and stoppage of deliveries. 
Between March 1 and 10, approximately, there will be noimprovement in the food situation. 
 We have left ourselves no stocks. 
 The thing now is to hold out, to bear the present situation with the greatest possible firmness. 
 There is acertain improvement in deliveries from the Caucasus, butthere is a likelihood that things may get worse. 
 Apparentlythe uprising in Armenia will quieten down, 311 but deliveries from the Caucasus can in no way compensate us for non -deliveries from Siberia, although pressure is being put on theSouth -Eastern Railway to make up the losses. 
 This is sad news, but it can’t be helped. 
 In the banditism one feels the influence of the Socialist -Revolutionaries. 
 Their main forces are abroad; every springthey dream of overthrowing Soviet power. 
 Chernov wrote about this recently in a Russian newspaper abroad. 
 The S. 
R. 
s are connected with the local instigators. 
 This connec -tion is to be seen in the fact that the uprisings take place inthe very districts from which we take grain. 
 The surplus -appropriation system here met with tremendous difficulties. 
The same system is being applied in Siberia, but there they still have stocks left over from previous years. 
 The deterioration has spread to fuel as well. 
 We have no exact figures, so no clear deductions can be made, norcan we determine the causes of the fuel crisis. 
 We have come to the conclusion that there exists discontent of a general nature. 
 This discontent has to be caught from below, directly through the Party apparatus if it cannot be caught quickly through the administrative apparatus. 
 In addition to signs of bureaucratism, there are mistakes in the plan. 
 The plan should be checked when it is drawnup by being discussed in the press and at meetings. 
 We areobliged to stop enterprises and thereby upset the work of factories which do have fuel. 
 What is the matter? Clearly, besides mistakes, the plan contains material for legal pro -ceedings. 
 Proletarian elements should be sent into the offices. 
 Undoubtedly, until the floating season is over, we shall not emerge from the fuel crisis. 
 We must make the best possible use of sleighing and floating. 
 The fuel crisis has affected the textile mills, too, and they are unable to fulfileven a minimum programme. 
 There are the difficulties arising from banditism and interrupted communication with Siberia. 
 Smirnov’s 312 report says they are coping with banditism out there but cannot promise an improvement in grain deliveries. 
 Therefore, we should not disperse our attention in talk about the generalsituation, but concentrate our efforts on finding a way outof this situation. 
 A word or two about the situation in the Moscow organisa -tion. 
 Some comrades try to shift the blame for the squabbling on the majority of the Moscow Committee. 
 If the minority are dissatisfied they can appeal against the conferencedecision to the Central Committee. 
 I don’t know how theC. 
C. 
 will decide the question, but my own opinion is thatthe minority is to blame. 
 The resolution of the All -Russia Conference says that the opinion of the minority is to be reckoned with and that a discussion and debate is necessary within the Party. 
313 At the gubernia conference in November elections to the Moscow Committee took place on thisplatform. 
 314 A t w o -room system was applied, and that is already a rift; such a state of affairs, though, can no longerbe tolerated. 
 We permitted criticism not for the sake of criticism, but to get a correct decision passed. 
 Moscow has broken the record in discussions. 
 In November there wastalk about the Moscow Committee’s wrong line, and 120 voteswere given for it. 
 During the discussion, when everyone putforward his own platform, the votes against the MoscowCommittee were already less. 
 What democracy is it, if a conference cannot elect the M. 
C. 
? After a three -month discussion the blame for the squabbling falls on those whoare dissatisfied. 
 Of course, there is the formal right to appealagainst a decision, but it is the duty of revolutionaries torally more closely at difficult moments and not abuse theformal right of appeal. 
 Sixty -seven Russian newspapers abroad tell us that the S. 
R. 
s and others count on setting us at odds in the springat non -Party conferences. 
 And at such a moment people talk about appealing against the decision of the conference. 
 You have got to understand what you can appeal for, when and to what extent. 
 We gave everyone a chance to have his say, we held a discussion—and the congress will decide, but now we are at our fighting posts. 
 We have to rally and realise that one more step in the discussion and we are no longer a Party. 
 While not for a moment denying the right to appeal, I say that we performed our duty even without the discussion and should do our duty now. 
 We must send Communists to all the non-Party organisations and explain this difficult situation to them.

 Economic question: is advanced capitalism superior to us now in techniques and organisation? 10 a. 
 Can we now set ourselves the task of coping on our own, or is this Left -wing childishness, or stupid doctrinairism? 10 b. 
 Should the problem necessarily be put this way: in view of the gigantic danger of Soviet power’s break -down as a result of economic chaos and backwardness, the danger of falling behind , not catching up , the problem must be put only this way— to catch up by means of an alliance with foreign capital? “If we give up 4 and keep up with two -quarters— that is the ideal , which we shall not attain in a year, and if we do it in five years it will be a great victory. 
” This is a business -like, not infantile, way of putting the question. 
 11. 
 Why does Σ mean a gigantic political error? Wrong evaluation of perspectives, relations of classes both in Russia (proletariat, peasantry, bourgeoisie)and throughout the world. 
 12. 
 Economic significance = (α) bloc with advanced state capitalism against petty -bourgeois and backward ele-ment = (β) bloc with one imperialist trust against another. 
“Won’t be able to control?” Who? Tsarist and bour -geois officials? We. 
 Give up 4? Training ideal. 
 Give up 4, catch up with two -quarters (three -quarters unattainable ideal). 
 Then in 30 years (average concession term) we shallhave a peaceful victory, and in 15 probably buy it back.

 327 Lenin Written March 16, 1921 First published in 1959 Printed from the manuscript in Lenin Miscellany XXXVI MEETING OF THE COMMUNIST GROUP OF THE ALL-RUSSIA CENTRAL COUNCIL OF TRADE UNIONS APRIL 11, 1921328 1 REJOINDER DURING THE DEBATE We have just heard exceedingly diplomatic speeches on the part of Comrade Shlyapnikov and Comrade Ryazanov, who although they are now protesting very loudly, are never -theless protesting so diplomatically that they would makehighly satisfactory negotiators with concessionaires and with bourgeois states. 
 We have come to a meeting at which I report on the disagreements that arose in the CentralCommittee and the Council of People’s Commissars. 
 Thesame disagreements will emerge here during the discussion.... 
These differences were resolved by the decision of the TenthCongress, which says: “The decree of the C. 
P. 
C. 
 shall be approved and a concession shall be granted in Baku and Grozny. 
” We want to discuss this question here, that is whyI asked that Shlyapnikov’s and Ryazanov’s proposal shouldbe rejected, and they should have their inquisitiveness, notto say curiosity, gratified by the results of the ensuing debate. 
 First published in 1932 Printed from the shorthand in Lenin Miscellany XX record 2 REPLY TO THE DEBATE ON THE REPORT ON CONCESSIONS Comrades, the question was raised here from the very outset whether our differences in regard to concessions wereserious or not, and the desire was expressed, incidentally, by Comrade Shlyapnikov that more systematic information be given on each agreement. 
 I’m afraid this is impracticable,if only for technical reasons. 
 For instance, take the case of peace treaties with different countries. 
 After the general directives, which at first were drafted in great detail, it so fell out that a certain type of treaty with bourgeois countries was adopted by tacit consent, the mass of details being leftto the representatives authorised to sign the treaty. 
 Andmost of these details are probably unknown to the majorityof the members of the Council of People’s Commissars andthe Central Committee. 
 The same here: we were dealing with a question of principle and we thought there was a danger of disagreements arising. 
 Therefore the Party congress hadto step in, and therefore the present meeting, in which onlymembers of the Party are taking part, was a meeting calledfor the purpose of mutual information. 
 We have read out toyou what the Council of People’s Commissars has adopted. 
 329 The C. 
P. 
C. 
’s decision was adopted in spite of the motion by two very prominent trade unionists. 
 What other methodof information do the majority of the communist groupmembers have if not through such a meeting as this one? Itworks out that there were less disagreements than we thought. 
This is the most desirable thing for us. 
 No minutes of this meeting are being kept and we do not intend to have a press discussion on it. 
 Our purpose has been achieved. 
 In informing you of the decision of the Council of People’s Commissars, we are letting you know how we have acceptedthe decision of the Party congress. 
 The remaining differencesof opinion do not exceed those which arise from day to day on various questions and are decided by a simple vote, without becoming a hindrance to the work. 
 Submission tothe majority in that case is not only a matter of form, butan act that does not hinder further work. 
 I think we haveachieved here a result in that no serious differences have cometo light, and partial differences will be ironed out in the course of the work itself. 
 Comrade Ryazanov, characteristically, has tried to drag in disagreements with the Workers’ Opposition. 
 He speciallychose a formulation that was intended to be a teaser, buthe failed in this, and none of the speakers fell for it. 
 One comrade sent in a note saying that we here are con -cluding a second Treaty of Brest. 
 The first one had turned outwell, as to the second one, he has his doubts. 
 This is partlytrue, but the present agreement, in the field of economy is something between the Brest Treaty and an agreement with any bourgeois state. 
 We have already signed several such agreements, including a trade agreement with Britain. 
 The one on concessions will be something between the BrestTreaty and such agreements with bourgeois states. 
 Comrade Ryazanov then passed a remark, quite correctly, which I should like to underline at the very outset. 
 He saidthat if we want to grant a concession it was not meant to improve the position of the workers, but to raise the produc -tive forces. 
 Quite right! As to improving the position of the workers, we always stand by this. 
 I have here a draft agree -ment with a Swedish corporation of ball -bearing plants written by the staff of the Supreme Economic Council330 (reads ). 
 This agreement does not stipulate any improvement in the condition of the workers. 
 True, it is so worded that theRussian Government undertakes to supply the workers witheverything they need, and if it fails to do this, the capitalistshave the right to bring in workers from abroad. 
 As to theability of the Russian Government to fulfil everything the plan calls for as far as the workers are concerned, I think that neither we, nor the Supreme Economic Council, northe Swedes can have any illusions on this score. 
 At any rate,in this Comrade Ryazanov is quite right, for the main thingin concessions is not improvement of the workers’ condition,but the raising of the productive forces and such a transac -tion under which we are making great sacrifices in order toincrease output. 
 But what are these sacrifices? I have beentold that I gloss over these sacrifices, play them down. 
Comrade Ryazanov even tried to crack a joke On this score. 
I did not play down the sacrifices, I only said that we mayhave to give the capitalists not only hundreds, but thousands of per cent in profits. 
 That’s the whole gist of it! If, as I assumed, on the basis of calculations by our specialists, we take 30 -40 per cent of the oil, for instance, for ourselves, if the capitalist, out of every 100 million poodsof oil which he produces, takes 50 -60 million poods for himself, and possessing the transport, sells them at a profit of perhaps 1000 per cent, or maybe more, then the position is clear. 
 And when I tried to find out from Krasin the termsof his agreement on the basis of his preliminary talks with the businessmen and tycoons, I asked: “Can one conceive of a type of agreement under which we stipulate a definite percentage of profit for the capitalist, say up to 80 per cent. 
” He said: “It is not a question of the size of the profits, becausethese robbers now make as much as 1000 per cent, not 80. 
” To my mind, the sacrifices will be very heavy. 
 We shall probably have to make great sacrifices if we are going togive concessions on ores or timber, if we are going to give away raw materials which they are so desperately in need of abroad, such as manganese ore, for example. 
 Georgia has nowbecome Soviet. 
 The thing is to unite the Caucasian Republicsinto a single economic centre: the Georgian, Azerbaijan andArmenian Republics. 
 Azerbaijan produces oil; it has to betransported via Batum through Georgian territory, so there will be a single economic centre. 
 According to one report, the Georgian Menshevik govern -ment had concluded a concession agreement, which, on thewhole, is acceptable to us. 
 Preliminarily, I could only getin touch with Georgian comrades and ascertain from a talkwith Comrade Yenukidze, the Secretary of the All -Russia Central Executive Committee, who is himself a Georgian, that he had been there and concluded an agreement—true,not a concession agreement—with the Menshevik Georgiangovernment granting us without resistance one -sixth of Georgia while retaining a guarantee of inviolability. 
331 After this agreement, to the signing of which Comrade Yenukidze was a party, they preferred nevertheless, despite the guarantee of inviolability, to quit Batum for Constanti -nople, so that we have gained by this in two ways, positivelyand negatively—in that we have acquired territory, not forRussia, but for Soviet Georgia—Batum and its environs—and in that we have lost a good many Mensheviks, who have left for Constantinople. 
 It appears that the Georgian Revolutionary Committee is inclined to confirm the concession on unworked coal -mines, which it considers a very important one. 
 Two representativesof foreign powers were in Georgia and did not leave at thetime of the Soviet coup—the Italian and the German— a most important circumstance, as it is desirable to develop relations with these countries, by means, among others, ofconcessions. 
 Italy even had a concession agreement with Georgia, while in Germany the situation is that some German capitalists own a tremendous per cent of the Chiatura man -ganese mines. 
 The thing is to transfer the right of ownershipto a lease or a concession, that is, to grant on lease to theGerman capitalists the very mines which they owned asproperty. 
 Owing to the change in the political situationin the Caucasus, the circumstances are favourable for con -cession relations. 
 The important thing for us is to force windows open one after another. 
 The agreement with Britain332 was that of a Socialist Republic with a bourgeois state, an agreement that imposed upon us a certain burden. 
 To the first state with whom we concluded an agreement we gave a much greater part of our gold fund than we havegiven to others. 
 But the consequences have shown that thanks to this agreement we have forced open a window of sorts. 
 It is from this point of view that we should judgeevery concession. 
 Germany and Italy, owing to their economic position, are obliged to seek an alliance with Russia. 
 For Russia, analliance with Germany opens up vast economic prospects, irrespective of whether or not the German revolution will soon win a victory there. 
 We can come to terms even witha bourgeois government in Germany, because the VersaillesTreaty has made Germany’s position impossible, whereas analliance with Russia opens up entirely different possibilities. 
Since Italy has no fuel resources of her own, they have taken a coal -mining concession in the Caucasus at coal -fields that have never been worked before. 
 I should not be surprisedto see the Germans hankering after oil concessions, asGermany has no fuel at all. 
 One of the comrades here said that the Kamchatka conces -sion would not improve the condition of the workers. 
 That is absolutely wrong. 
 And Comrade Ryazanov was quite wrong when he tried to crack a joke about our dealings withVanderlip turning out to be a Vander -slip. 
 True, we made one mistake—our telegram to Harding. 
 But since we havehad no agreements or relations with America till now, therewas no mistake on our part, and we only found out that Vanderlip had been boasting of his connections with the American Administration. 
 Now it is quite possible that insending our representatives to Canada, where we are to buy locomotives, that through this side door we may gain some access to the American market. 
 Negotiations for Kamchatka concessions are beginning to stir now, and it is quite wrong to say that these concessionswill not improve the condition of the workers. 
 If theseconcessions materialise, there will be an undoubtedimprovement in the condition of the workers, because weshall be receiving a certain deduction share, 2 per cent I believe, and when we have nothing at all, even 2 per cent is something. 
 If we get 20,000 out of one million and useit for an exchange with the peasants, this will give us someof the products the workers need. 
 Further I wanted to point out that some of the remarks you have made here show that there are disagreements among the trade unionists, or rather perplexities, which are the only real danger and which we, among ourselves, perhapsby further discussions among the Party members, have toeliminate. 
 For example, Comrade Marshev spoke aboutpayment having to be made in cash, and not by coupons. 
As to the Amsterdamists 333 and whether they will attack us, we must come to an arrangement about this. 
 I recently re -read my pamphlet written in May 1918. 
 * I quoted in it the Menshevik newspaper Vperyod334 in which the Menshevik Isuv accused the Soviet government ofagreeing to concessions, of having deals with bourgeois states. 
It is an old trick of the Mensheviks to blame us for granting concessions. 
 Quite a few groups have already taken shape in this connection in Western Europe. 
 The Communistsunderstand that concessions are a treaty of Brest, whichwe are obliged to put up with because of the ruined stateof a country with a predominantly peasant population. 
Everyone understands that regeneration of the country with -out a big industry is unthinkable. 
 The Communists of Germany understand why we have to give ground, but the Scheidemanns and the II 2 Interna -tional say that these concessions are proof of our completefailure, and I remember at a meeting last year I mentionedthe American chauvinist Spargo, ** who specialised in *See Vol.

— Ed. 
 writing a heap of books about the Bolsheviks in the vein of our Alexinsky, and in connection with the concessions he all but performed a dance of triumph. 
 I mentioned at the time that this was an utter distortion. 
 Yesterday inter -national capital was out to strangle us, and today wehave a number of agreements with this internationalcapital. 
 We are making sacrifices in giving away to foreign capital millions’ worth of valuable materials from which they can make profits running into hundreds of per cent. 
 These aresacrifices which we are making deliberately and consciously. 
But at the same time we should note that while allowingthem to make any profit they like, we are receiving theadvantages we need ourselves, i. 
e. 
, increased output, and as far as possible an improvement in the condition of our workers, both those employed at the concession enterprisesand those not so employed. 
 Comrade Shlyapnikov said here that it would be a good thing to grant a concession to Russian workers. 
 The ideais absurd. 
 We would then have to guarantee fuel, etc. 
, a thing which we can’t guarantee even to our most essential enterprises. 
 We are bad off for fuel. 
 The idea of a concessionagreement with Russian workers, generally speaking, ispermissible in principle, but such a solution of the problemfor our big industry is not serious, since we cannot guaranteethem anything, whereas foreign concessionaires can bring in supplies from abroad. 
 That is what distinguishes the agreement with foreign capitalists. 
 They have the worldmarket, we have no secure economic base and would haveto spend ten years creating it. 
 This is what we must soberlytake into account. 
 All our people engaged in this problemhave proved this situation. 
 We know that the electrification plan is the most econom -ical one. 
 We cannot lease our big factories to the Russian workers. 
 We must stake here on small industry, developit and not rail at our tax -in-kind measures the way Comrade Ryazanov does, or the author of that pamphlet which saysthat we are putting through anarcho -syndicalist laws. 
 As regards the development of small industry, we must take several steps, as we can get something out of it rightnow without state guarantees, and since we cannot guarantee even our most essential factories, we must do everything we can to develop small industry, which will give us a certain amount of produce which the peasants need. 
 On the question of cash or coupons I would say this: it would be something to fear if the capitalists had the power,but we have nothing to fear, since all the factories and enter -prises are in our hands, and we haven’t leased a tenth partof them to the capitalists. 
 I repeat, we have nothing to fear from coupons, as the capitalists will be obliged to stock the goods we tell them to, not just salted fish, as was mentionedhere, but such -and-such products. 
 Since we are taking the norm of a foreign worker, we know that under this normhe gets even more and better products than the Russianworker does. 
 Comrade Shlyapnikov here said: “We have seen conces -sions. 
” Both Comrade Shlyapnikov and many practical workers make this mistake. 
 I have heard people say: “Youridea of concessions is schematic. 
 The capitalist has alwaystricked the most experienced Russian lawyers. 
” To be surehe did, when state power was in the capitalist’s hands and he was all -powerful. 
 What was that state power? A committee for the affairs of the propertied master class—that’s whatit was. 
 A committee for the affairs of the landowners andcapitalists—that was what the capitalist government was. 
But if we, having in our hands most of the factories, millsand railways, with our Party standing at the head—with communist cells below and Communists on top—if we do not hold our own in such conditions, then we might as wellcommit suicide. 
 And that is panic! We are not that bad though, I think, to allow ourselves to be tricked, and if we have already concluded severalagreements in which the governments in France and Britain had the services of first -class bourgeois diplomats, and if even under these conditions we have not once been tricked,then why should we panic at the idea of being tricked bycoupons? Let me remind you of the treaty of Brest. 
 In whatway was this treaty difficult? What were the difficulties ofdefence? When I was asked whether I had any hopes of our being able to fool the Germans, I was obliged, in my official capacity, to say that I did not. 
 But now the treaty of Brestis past history. 
 I don’t know whether the pamphlet Comrade Kamenev was preparing has come out (it deals there with Ludendorf), but I do know that Ludendorf has written a brilliant volume of memoirs in which ten pages are devoted to the Brest negotia -tions. 
 When Kamenev and I read that chapter we said:“This is the best justification of the Brest Treaty. 
” He tellshow Trotsky and the others had driven them into a cornerduring the talks, how they were outwitted, and so on. 
 We decided there and then that these pages had to be trans -lated and published with a short preface by Comrade Kamenev, and the fact that this hasn’t been done yet isa specimen of Soviet ineptitude. 
 Or take a fact like this. 
We know that Comrade Joffe, our Ambassador to theGerman Government, was expelled from Germany on the eve of the revolution there. 
 After this, don’t try to guess who is going to trick whom. 
 Don’t let us lay down how many dayswill pass between the conclusion of the first concessionagreement and the first big European revolution. 
 That iswhy, on the question of agreements, I maintain that the com -rades are absolutely wrong. 
 There’s nothing to worry about. 
 The agreements will say what goods they are to have and at what price. 
 We can agree to any coupons or ration books. 
If they break the agreement we have the right to cancel itimmediately. 
 The agreement is a civil contract. 
 I haven’tgone into the question of what arbitration there is to be andwho is to settle disputes, but I shall run through the initial draft of the agreement with the Swedish corporation. 
 It says here: “Differences are settled.... 
” People here have brought academicians into play, and these will try to bring the lawyers into play. 
 I rememberBebel saying that lawyers were the most reactionary andat the same time bourgeois, people. 
 Of course, we can mend this somehow, but there is nothing at all to worry about. 
 If the concessionaires were to lay down this condition wecould accept it. 
 Once the agreement stipulates preciselythat there are to be such -and-such goods and payment on the ration book is to be made in such -and-such a way, we can agree to this, and the Socialist Republic has nothing to fear from coupons or ration books. 
 It was further stated that Point 9 was bad because we would be drawing away fromthe international T. 
U. 
C. 
 335 Lozovsky threatened that the Amsterdam people would slam us, but they will slam us all the same on all other points, and end up, as always, with slamming themselves. 
 You remember how the Mensheviks intended slamming us for having made the slightest concessions to the capitalists. 
When we wanted to overthrow capitalism, they said wewould overthrow it only for a few days, but when we haveoverthrown it for a few years, they are trying to set another trap for us. 
 They are trying to lure the enemy into a spot where he is sure to be beaten. 
 First they called us utopians, then invited us to jump from the fifth floor. 
 We know that we have many smallbusinesses. 
 Petty proprietors are our opponents. 
 The petty -bourgeois element is our most dangerous enemy. 
 Brokers and leaseholders are the lesser enemy. 
 Bureaucracy, too, and bureaucratic abuses are our enemy. 
 In regard to the point Comrade Lozovsky spoke about, I will say this—listen to it carefully. 
 It says: “The tradeunions shall not have the right to demand application ofRussian pay rates or of Russian rules of employment to that category of workers. 
” It speaks here of the Russian trade unions, and I am told about the international unions. 
Naturally, when the capitalists see the Russian terms, theysay they are communist terms, ridiculous terms, and thatthe Russian trade unions have no right to demand Russianterms of employment, which are likely to be pretty stiff and far -fetched, but they do have a full right to apply international trade union agreements. 
 This is good enough. 
Nothing is mentioned here about strikes, about their beingbanned. 
 The thing is to be able not to mention everythingbefore its time. 
 As to improving the condition of the Russian worker, Comrade Marshev and Tartakovsky have made an attack here, saying you won’t be able to cope with the workers,you won’t be able to make them work, because if you providefor one -fifth of them, the other four -fifths won’t want to work under worse conditions. 
 Do you mean to say we are dealingwith workers who are so foolish, uncultivated and undiscip -lined? If so, then the only thing is to panic and commit sui -cide. 
 If a hundred workers are underfed and we tell them thatwe can feed twenty, and no more, do you mean to say they will refuse it? So far we have not come up against anything like it. 
 We have managed somehow to feed workers in certain branches of industry, but not all of them, yet the workers didn’t all run away from these enterprises, whereas they alldid from other enterprises. 
 Can the Russian worker be sospoilt by the mistakes of Soviet power that he cannot figureout that it were better to feed at least 20 people than tomake the whole hundred go hungry? There is a good deal here that ought not to be spoken about before its time. 
 Why can’t it be arranged for people to take turns in workingfor the capitalists? The workers would work six months, getworking clothes, then give others a chance to feed up. 
 Ofcourse, we shall have to break down prejudices here. 
 When concessionaires come here, we must restrain our trade unions from making excessive demands. 
 You know that the usual term of an agreement is a short one. 
 In Europethere are no long -term agreements. 
 The usual term is six months. 
 In this way the workers will be able to feed up,get boots and clothes, then quit and make way for others. 
 Is it so impossible to arrange things so that a man works six months, feeds up, gets American boots and clothes, and makes room for the next man? It will be difficult, of course. 
It will demand a higher degree of organisation and disciplinethan we have, but it is not impossible. 
 If we have contrivedto keep a hold on the workers against an invasion of foreigncapital during three years of terrible famine, do you mean to say we won’t manage it this time? I realise only too well what difficulties confront us here. 
 And therefore I say thatconcessions do not signify the advent of peace among theclasses. 
 Concessions are a continuation of the war amongthe classes. 
 If previously the war could be expressed in—I’ll get you through starvation and you’ll get nothing, now I say that I want to give the workers a pair of boots each, but I wantthem to work six months. 
 And we’ll fight for all the workersgetting boots. 
 We do not reject strikes, all this remains inour hands, if only we are reasonable and try to put theaccent now on what we can do to attract the capitalists. 
 People here have talked about what a great danger this is, saying that the capitalist will come and trick us, but I assertthat there is no danger, and that in the interests of raising productivity it is desirable that he should come, because he has a splendidly organised base and splendidly equipped factories, where we can order the necessary parts without having to buy them on the open market, where there is onlyjunk. 
 The first -class factories have their orders booked up for several years ahead. 
 Even if we paid in gold we wouldnot receive anything, whereas a member of the syndicatewould get everything he wanted. 
 We wouldn’t mind paying him extra if it meant improving the condition of at least a small section of the workers and peasants, because eachextra product will go to the peasants in exchange for grain,and that will create stable relations between the workingclass and the peasantry. 
 Winding up, I would ask the trade unionists to waive questions of principle and disputes. 
 All these are idle dis -putes, sheer scholasticism. 
 They should be dropped. 
 Attention should be wholly directed to those practical terms of con -cession agreements from which we, if we are sensible, mayderive benefit for ourselves. 
 The trade unionists and Partyleaders should display here their inventiveness and practical knowledge of conditions, of which we cannot and shall not speak about in the press, because the Russian press is beingfollowed by the capitalists, just as during the Brest talkswe did not speak about the instructions that had been givento Comrade Joffe. 
 We shall give practical attention to thepractical methods by which we can derive benefit in the way of improving the condition of the workers and peasants. 
 Every such improvement is of tremendous importance to us. 
This is where the trade unionists should give their attention. 
All trace of friction and prejudice should be eliminated. 
It is a difficult business. 
 So far no one has been willing toconclude a concession agreement with us. 
 They are all expecting us to present impracticable demands. 
 We, therefore, on our part must use every effort to con -clude several such agreements. 
 Of course, we shall makea number of mistakes. 
 It is a new business. 
 So far no socialistrepublic has ever granted concessions to capitalists. 
 But wewant the trade unionists to help us. 
 There is vast scope here for interpretations and pressure, including strikes, which remain in our hands.

 Contents: the experience of non -Party conferences has fully proved that they have become an arena for agitation ** by the Mensheviks and Socialist -Revolutionaries; therefore, the greatest care must be taken in organising non-Party conferences, by no means allowing them to be held without thorough preparation at each respective factory. 
The Gubernia Party Committees should be answerable to theParty for the success of every non -Party conference. 
 Every Gubernia Party Committee is obliged to report to the Central Committee not only on the success of every non -*The last paragraph is in the handwriting of L.

 Party conference, but prior to every non -Party conference, setting forth its conditions and preparedness. 
 At the same time it is absolutely essential to step up the work of preserving and developing the Communists’ tieswith the non -Party masses. 
 For this purpose it is necessary: not only to regularly hold general meetings for the rank -and-file workers and peasants, but arrange business reports to the rank -and-file workers and peasants by officials holding key posts. 
 Such reports must be delivered at least once a month in order that the non -Party rank -and-file be given an opportunity to criticise the Soviet institutions and theirwork. 
 Reports are to be made not only by Communists, butby all officials in top posts, first and foremost those of thefood supply and economic council agencies. 
 Every gubernia committee is obliged to forward exact information monthly to the Central Committee about thenumber and progress of all these reports, as well as thedemands made by the non -Party people at these meetings. 
 The C. 
C. 
 will draw up more detailed instructions on the organisation of such reports, on the measures for checking ties with the masses, on the progress of the work for improv -ing their condition, and on fighting the Mensheviks and Socialist -Revolutionaries, who are acting under the guise of non -Party people, etc.

P. 
 Group of the Trade Union Congress The Central Committee approves Comrade Chubar’s theses (adopted by the group’s bureau) and rejects Comrade Holtz -mann’s theses in view of the fact that the former far more correctly take into consideration the actual state of ourresources, capabilities and means, which entail the necessityof planning slower realisation of our immediate aims. 
 The latter theses, those of Comrade Holtzmann, on the other hand, verge on the fantastic in many ways, they areout of touch with reality, which is also one of the failingsof Comrade Larin, who zealously supports these theses. 
 The only important similarity between the two theses, practically speaking, is the idea expressed in the note toPoint 3 of Chubar’s theses * and in Point 6 ** of Holtzmann’s theses, both comrades confirming here, and not disputing,the decision passed by the C.

 TENTH ALL -RUSSIA CONFERENCE OF THE R. 
C. 
P. 
 (B. 
)357 MAY 26-28, 1921 1 STATEMENT CONCERNING THE AGENDA MAY 26 Comrades, as I have already told you, we intended to have a single item on the agenda in keeping with the nature ofthis conference, namely, the question of economic policy. 
The remaining reports were to be informational, so I did not prepare a political report, but I think this report will have to be dealt with on an economic plane. 
 Therefore, inorder to satisfy everybody, I suggest that supplementaryquestions be put to me after the report and I shall answerthem in my summing -up speech. 
 I repeat, I have made no preparations whatever on this question and cannot imagine what I would speak about if I had to apart from the question of the tax in kind. 
 First published in 1963 Printed from the shorthand in the Fifth Russian Edition record of the Collected Works , Vol. 
 43 2 SPEECHES DURING THE DEBATE OF THE MOTION ON QUESTIONS OF THE NEW ECONOMIC POLICY MAY 28 1 I believe this amendment358 should not be adopted, because an explanation to the amendment would then be needed. 
 Naturally, if there is a revolution in Europe we shall change our policy. 
 Civil war, which such a revolution always involves, as you know, may in fact render our position evenworse. 
 Of course, this will be a short time, it is difficult, of course, to determine how long civil war in other republics /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR will last, but when it is over and won we shall change our policy in the sense that we may say: we shall take nothing in taxes, and only by commodity exchange. 
 This has to be made clear to the peasants, otherwise they will think:what’s this, back again to the surplus -appropriation system? I believe, therefore, that it were best not to add anythingof this kind. 
 Long years of revolution in Europe and civilwar will lead to commodity exchange without any tax at all. 
 This is stated in the resolution before the congress, which says that the tax will gradually be reduced. 
 This is thepoint the forthcoming victorious revolution applies to, arevolution which a long period of years turns into a shortone. 
 2359 Comrades, it was on this point that we had discussions in the committee, where opinion was divided. 
 At firstMilyutin objected to the words “anarchic commodity ex -change to be combated” on the grounds that this would be con -strued as cavilling, and freedom to trade would, in practice,be done away with. 
 When this point was drawn up in itspresent wording, which said: “anarchic commodity exchangeto be combated” since “it eludes all control and supervision”—by this is meant the black -market “bagmen”, and you know that illicit trade is punishable in all countries where there is freedom of trading, even in capitalist countries; on this point we see eye to eye. 
 In what way is it to be combated?By having commodity exchange concentrated chiefly in thehands of the co -operatives, to which is added: “without, however, any restrictions on regular free market operations. 
”When this wording was adopted the committee unanimously agreed that there was still a danger of free market operations being restricted. 
 This is a delicate matter, of course. 
 Wedon’t want this ruling to restrict freedom to trade, but wecan’t do without measures against illicit trade, specificallyagainst black -market bagmen and transport dislocation. 
 The committee thought of using a milder word than “combat -ing”, but then agreed that the target was only anarchiccommodity exchange that eluded all control on the partof the state, all the more as this was qualified by the added proviso, saying “without, however, any restrictions on regular free market operations”. 
 With this addition, the word “combat” is not too strong an expression. 
 The amend -ment which the comrade here proposes is risky in the sense that we shall be defeating our own purpose. 
 He throws outthe words “without, however, any restrictions on regularmarket operations.... 
” 3360 I think the state farms are not equal to this, they are still very weak. 
 Let them improve a bit for another year, and thenext year we shall see whether we can expand their initiativeor not. 
 4 The last amendment is an unhappy one,361 since the ques -tion of material resources is covered by Point 5: “Revision of(certain sections of) production programmes for large -scale industry with a view to increasing the manufacture of consumer goods and peasant household articles. 
 “Extension of the independence and initiative of each large establishment in the matter of disposing of financial andmaterial resources. 
 A precise decision to that effect to besubmitted for approval to the Council of People’s Commis -sars. 
” Therefore, we shall not repeat this here. 
 The questionof material distribution, that of food, for example, is statedhere quite definitely, without prejudice, of course, to thecentre, because without it being gathered in the centrethere can be no question of industry. 
 As regards the firstremark of the comrade who said that it was inappropriate just now to consider the question of the local economic conferences settled, as these might upset things—I havenot heard anything about this. 
 On the contrary, there havebeen demands to introduce economic conferences everywhere,acting as commissions of the C.

 itself, andlocally, too, there are to be no special staffs, no special bodies, but the same offices and departments. 
 The gubernia economic conference is a perfectly suitable form, which does not hamper, but facilitates the conference. 
 As the Instructions say: “with leeway in modifying the main type,that is, the executive committees may assume all thefunctions and duties of the economic conferences...” ( reads ), so that there is no ruling prescribing an absolutely hard -and-fast and single course of action. 
 Besides, the resolution proposed by the commission says: “Adopt in principle. 
” The commission362 is meeting and functioning, its Chairman Osinsky tells us they have reviewed quite a number of pointsand already submitted them in writing. 
 The work is of adifficult nature, and it will require another special commis -sion. 
 The fear that we shall be tying our hands by declaring that it is adopted in principle is therefore groundless. 
 5363 We have no objection; judging by the subject, however, it does not belong here, but to Point 6. 
364 I propose that it be adopted in principle and placed under Point 6. 
 6365 These are mere details. 
 The question should be raised at the session of the All -Russia Central Executive Committee and discussed with the people concerned. 
 There can be noobjection in principle, but generally speaking this is a detail. 
 7366 This fear is excessive here. 
Point 7 of our resolution says “The need to maintain and enforce the apparatus for the full and expeditiouscollection of the tax in kind”. 
 Naturally, the tax in kind will be collected not by persuasion, it can be collected only by compulsion, and that is what the apparatus stands for. 
Today several important decisions and instructions have been signed, all aimed at preserving and strengthening the apparatus, from which we shall demand expeditious collec -tion of the tax in kind. 
 It is pointed out that we say here:“commodity exchange is brought to the fore” and the fearis expressed that the peasants will understand this as priorityfor commodity exchange. 
 In that case we shall write: “holdsa specially important place.

 W. 
 KUUSINEN AND REMARKS ON THE DRAFT “THESES ON THE ORGANISATIONAL ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMUNIST PARTIES, ON THE METHODS AND CONTENT OF THEIR WORK” To Comrade Kuusinen Urgent. 
 Address: from Finnish comrades or at the Comintern. 
 10/VI. 
 Comrade Kuusinen, I have read your article (3 chapters) and the theses with great pleasure. 
 I enclose my remarks in connection with the theses. 
 I advise you to immediately find a German comrade (a real German) to improve the German text (of the article and the theses). 
 Perhaps this comrade, on your behalf, would read your article as a report at the Third Congress (it would be much more convenient for the German delegates to heara German . 
 369 My advice is—cross out the end (of the theses). 
 Re propaganda and agitation—much greater detail— especially on the press, but also on verbal propaganda. 
 I think you should definitely take upon yourself the report at this congress I shall write to Zinoviev about this today. 
 Best regards, Yours, Lenin Theses (Thesis 6 or) §6, 2nd par. 
, last sentence should read:“... will inevitably inherit this tendency to a certain extent from ... environment.... 
” And the next sentence should read:“... the Communist Party should overcome this tendency by systematic and persistent organisational work andrepeated improvements and corrections.... 
” (Thesis 7 or) §7: It should be stated at greater length that this is exactly what is lacking in most of the legal parties of the West. 
There is no everyday work ( revolutionary work) by every member of the Party. 
 This is the chief drawback. 
To change this is the most difficult job of all. 
 But this is the most important. 
 §10. 
This needs amplifying. 
More details. 
Examples. 
The role of the newspaper. 
 “Our” newspaper compared with the usual capitalist newspaper. 
 Work for “our” newspaper. 
 Example: Russian newspapers of 1912 -13. 
 The fight against the bourgeois papers. 
 Exposure of their venality, their lies, etc. 
 Distribution of leaflets. 
Home agitation. 
Sunday outings, etc. 
Far more details. 
 §11—far more details here too. 
 §13. 
 Presenting reports and discussion of reports in the “cells”. 
 Reports on hostile and especially on petty -bourgeois organisations (the Labour Party, the Socialist parties, etc. 
). 
 Greater detail about duties among the mass of the unorgan -ised proletariat and of the proletariat organised in the yellow trade unions (including the II and II 2 Internationals) and the non -proletarian sections of the working people . 
 §§26 and 27. 
This is irrelevant. 
This is not an “organisational question”. 
 This subject had better be dealt with in a special article for the Communist International , say: “Organisational Questions in Revolutionary Periods” and so forth. 
 Or: “On the Question of Mounting Revolution and Our Corresponding Tasks” (on the basis of Russian and Finnishexperience).

 KUUSINEN AND W. 
 KOENEN370 To Comrades Kuusinen and Koenen 9/VII. 
1921 Dear Comrades, I read your draft theses on the organisational question with great pleasure. 
 I think you have done a very good job. 
 May I suggest just two addenda: 1) advice—control commissions consisting of the best, tried and experienced workers to be formed in all parties; 2) re spies—a special point in connection with the question of illegal work. 
 Contents roughly as follows: the bourgeoisie is bound to infiltrate spies and provoca -teurs into the illegal organisations. 
 A thoroughgoingand unremitting struggle should be waged against this, and a method of struggle to be specially recommended is a skilful combination of legal work with illegal, verification (of fitness for illegal work) by means of prolonged legal work.

 3 3 REMARKS ON THE DRAFT THESES ON TACTICS FOR THE THIRD CONGRESS OF THE COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL LETTER TO G. 
 Y. 
 ZINOVIEV372 The crux of the matter is that Levi in very many respects is right politically . 
 Unfortunately, he is guilty of a number of breaches of discipline for which the Party has expelled him. 
 Thalheimer’s and Béla Kun’s theses are politically utterly fallacious. 
 Mere phrases and playing at Leftism. 
 Radek is vacillating and has spoilt his original draft by a number of concessions to “Leftist” silliness. 
 His first“concession” is highly characteristic: in §1 of his theses “Umgrenzung der Fragen ” he first had “winning the majority of the working class ( to the principles of communism )” (mark this). 
 Amended (verballhornt) to: “winning the socially decisive sections of the working class. 
” A gem! To weaken here, in such a context, the necessity of winning precisely the majority of the working class “to the principles of communism,” is the height of absurdity. 
 To win power, you need, under certain conditions (even when the majority of the working class have already been won over to the principles of communism ) a blow dealt at the decisive place by the majority of the socially decisivesections of the working class. 
 To modify, verballhornen, this truth in such a way that §1 of the general tasks of the Communist Internationalabout winning the working class to the principles of commu -nism weakens the idea about the necessity of winning the majority of the working class, is a classic example of Béla Kun’s and Thalheimer’s ineptitude (it looks all right,dammit, but it’s all damn’d wrong) and of Radek’s ... hasty complaisance . 
 Radek’s theses were much too long and boneless, and lacked a political central point. 
 And Radek diluted them still more, spoilt them hopelessly. 
 What’s to be done? I don’t know. 
 So much time and effort wasted. 
 If you don’t want an open fight at the congress, then propose: 1) that Thalheimer’s and B. 
 Kun’s theses be rejected by exact voting this very day (since Bukharin assures me thatthe basic points have to be settled not later than today:they were better postponed) as being basically erroneous. 
Have this recorded. 
 You will spoil everything if you don’tdo this and show indulgence. 
 2) that Radek’s first draft, “unimproved” by any correc -tions, one specimen of which I have quoted, should be adopted as a basis. 
 3) that 1 -3 persons be entrusted with cutting down the text and improving it so that it is no longer boneless (if thatis possible!) and clearly, precisely and unequivocally puts into focus as the central ideas the following: None of the Communist Parties anywhere have yet won the majority (of the working class), not only as regardsorganisational leadership, but to the principles of communismas well. 
 This is the basis of everything. 
 To “weaken” this foun -dation of the only reasonable tactic is criminal irresponsibility . 
 Hence: revolutionary explosions are possible nevertheless very soon considering the abundance of inflammable material in Europe; an easy victory of the working class—in exceptionable cases—is also possible. 
 But it would be absurd now to base the tactics of the Communist International on this possibility; it is absurd and harmful to write and thinkthat the propaganda period has ended and the period ofaction has started. 
 The tactics of the Communist International should be based on a steady and systematic drive to win the majority of the working class , first and foremost within the old trade unions . 
 Then we shall win for certain, whatever the course of events. 
 As for “winning” for a short time in an exceptional -ly happy turn of events—any fool can do that. 
 Hence: the tactic of the Open Letter373 should definitely be applied everywhere. 
 This should be said straight out, clearly and exactly, because waverings in regard to the “Open Letter” are extremely harmful, extremely shamefuland extremely widespread . 
 We may as well admit this. 
 All those who have failed to grasp the necessity of the OpenLetter tactic should be expelled from the Communist Inter -national within a month after its Third Congress. 
 I clearly see my mistake in voting for the admission of KAPD. 
374 It will have to be rectified as quickly and fully as possible. 
 Instead of spinning a long yarn like Radek, we had better have the whole text of the Open Letter translated (andin German quoted in full), its significance properly broughthome and adopted as a model. 
 I would confine the general resolution on tactics to this. 
 Only then will the tone be set. 
 The central idea will be clear. 
 There will be no woolliness. 
 No possibility of everyonereading his own meaning into it (like in Radek’s). 
 Radek’s original draft would then be cut down to a quar -ter, at least. 
 It is time we stopped writing and voting brochures instead of theses. 
 Under this system partial mistakes are inevitablewith any of us, even when the matter is indisputable. 
 Andwhen we have something boneless and disputable we arebound to make big mistakes and spoil the whole thing. 
 And then, if you have the itch for it, you can add a supple -ment: on the basis of such a tactic, specifically by way ofexample, precisely as an example and not as a principle,we add so -and-so and so -and-so. 
 Further. 
 To generalise Serrati and Levi into the same “opportunism” is stupid. 
 Serrati is guilty; of what? It should be said clearly and precisely—on the Italian question, and not on the question of general tactics. 
 Of having split with the Commu -nists and not having expelled the reformists, Turati & Co. 
Until you have carried this out, Italian comrades, you areoutside the Communist International. 
 We are expelling you. 
 375 And to the Italian Communists—serious advice and the demand : so long as you have not been able by persistence, patience and skill to convince and win over the majority of the Serratian workers , don’t swagger, don’t play at Leftism. 
 “Fall Levi” * is not in general tactics, but in the appraisal of Märzaktion, ** on the German question. 
 Brandler says: there was a defensive. 
 The government provoked it. 
 Assuming this is true, that it is a fact. 
What deduction is to be drawn from this? 1) That all the shouting about an offensive—and there was any amount of it—was erroneous and absurd; 2) that it was a tactical error to call for a general strike once there was provocation on the part of the government,who wanted to draw the small fortress of communism into the struggle (the district in the centre where the Communistsalready had a majority). 
 3) Mistakes like this must be avoided in future, as the situation in Germany is a special one after the killing of 20,000 workers in the civil war through the skilfulmanoeuvres of the Right. 
 4) To call the defensive of hundreds of thousands of workers (Brandler says a million . 
 Isn’t he mistaken? Isn’t he exaggerating ? Why are there no figures by regions and cit -ies???) a “putsch”, and a “Bakuninist putsch” at that, is worse than a mistake, it is a breach of revolutionary discipline. 
Since Levi added to this a number of other breaches (listthem very carefully and exactly) he deserves his punishmentand has earned his expulsion. 
 The term of expulsion should be fixed, say, at six months at least. 
 He should then be permitted to seek readmission *The Levi case. 
— Ed. 
 **The March action. 
— Ed. 
 to the Party, and the Communist International advises that he be readmitted provided he has acted loyally during that time. 
 I have not yet read anything, apart from Brandler’s pamphlet, and am writing this on the basis of Levi’s andBrandler’s pamphlets. 
 Brandler has proved one thing—if hehas proved anything—that the Märzaktion was not a“Bakuninist putsch” [for such abusive language Levi ought to be expelled] but a heroic defence by revolutionary workers, hundreds of thousands of them; but however heroic it was,in future such a challenge, provoked by the government, which, since I. 
1919, has already killed by provocations20,000 workers should not be accepted until the Communists have the majority behind them all over the country, and not just in one small district. 
 ((The July days of 1917 were not a Bakuninist putsch. 
 For such an appraisal we would have expelled a person fromthe Party. 
 The July days were an heroic offensive . 
 And the deduction we drew was that we would not launch the nextheroic offensive prematurely . 
 Premature acceptance of a general battle—that is what the Märzaktion really was. 
 Not a putsch, but a mistake , mitigated by the heroism of a defensive by hundreds of thousands. 
)) Concerning "meral. 
 Can’t we have at least 2 or 3 documents ? There would be no harm in having at least 2 documents (2 -4 pages each) on each country printed for the Comintern. 
 What are the facts about "meral? about Strasser? Do not forget one of the chief things—to delete from Radek’s first theses everything relating to the “waitingparty”, to its censure. 
 It must all come out. 
 376 Regarding Bulgaria, Serbia (Yugoslavia?) and Czecho -slovakia, the question of these countries must be put con -cretely, specially, clearly, and precisely. 
 If opinion is divided on this, I suggest convening the Politbureau.

 3 5 SPEECHES AT A MEETING OF MEMBERS OF THE GERMAN, POLISH, CZECHOSLOVAK, HUNGARIAN AND ITALIAN DELEGATIONS JULY 11 1 I read certain reports yesterday in Pravda which have persuaded me that the moment for an offensive is perhapsnearer than we thought at the congress, and for which theyoung comrades attacked us. 
 I shall deal with these reportslater, however. 
 Just now I want to say that the nearer the general offensive is, the more “opportunistically” must we act. 
 You will now all return home and tell the workers that wehave become more reasonable than we were before the ThirdCongress. 
 You should not be put out by this; you will saythat we made mistakes and now wish to act more carefully;by doing so we shall win the masses over from the Social -Democratic and Independent Social -Democratic parties, masses, who, objectively, by the whole course of events, arebeing pushed towards us, but who are afraid of us. 
 I want to cite our own example to show you that we must act more carefully. 
 At the beginning of the war we Bolsheviks adhered to a single slogan—that of civil war, and a ruthless one atthat. 
 We branded as a traitor everyone who did not supportthe idea of civil war. 
 But when we came back to Russia inMarch 1917 we changed our position entirely. 
 When wereturned to Russia and spoke to the peasants and workers, we saw that they all stood for defence of the homeland, of course in quite a different sense from the Mensheviks, and wecould not call these ordinary workers and peasants scoundrelsand traitors. 
 We described this as “honest defencism”. 
I intend to write a big article about this and publish all thematerial. 
 On April 7 I published my theses, in which I called for caution and patience. 
 * Our original stand at the begin -ning of the war was correct: it was important then to form a definite and resolute core. 
 Our subsequent stand wascorrect too. 
 It proceeded from the assumption that themasses had to be won over. 
 At that time we already rejectedthe idea of the immediate overthrow of the Provisional Government. 
 I wrote: “It should be overthrown, for it is an oligarchic, and not a people’s government, and isunable to provide peace or bread. 
 But it cannot be over -thrown just now, for it is being kept in power by theworkers’ Soviets and so far enjoys the confidence of theworkers. 
 We are not Blanquists, we do not want to rule with a minority of the working class against the majority. 
” ** The Cadets, who are shrewd politicians, immediately noticed the contradiction between our former position and the newone, and called us hypocrites. 
 But as, in the same breath,they had called us spies, traitors, scoundrels and Germanagents, the former appellation made no impression. 
 The first crisis occurred on April 20. 
 Milyukov’s Note on the Dardanelles showed the government up for what it was—an imperialist government. 
 After this the armed masses ofthe soldiery moved against the building of the governmentand overthrew Milyukov. 
 They were led by a non -Party man named Linde. 
 This movement had not been organised *See Vol. 
 24 of this edition, pp. 
 19 -26. 
— Ed. 
 **Ibid. 
, p. 
 40. 
— Ed. 
 by the Party. 
 We characterised that movement at the time as follows: something more than an armed demonstration, and something less than an armed uprising. 
 At our conference on April 22 the Left trend demanded the immediate over -throw of the Government. 
 The Central Committee, on thecontrary, declared against the slogan of civil war, and weinstructed all agitators in the provinces to deny the out -rageous lie about the Bolsheviks wanting civil war. 
 On April 22 I wrote that the slogan “Down with the Provisional Government” was incorrect, since if we did not have themajority of the people behind us this slogan would be eitheran empty phrase or adventurism. 
 * We did not hesitate in face of our enemies to call our Leftists “adventurists”. 
 The Mensheviks crowed over this and talked about our bankruptcy. 
 But we said that any attempt to be slightly, if only a wee bit, left of the C. 
C. 
was folly, and those who stood left of the C. 
C. 
 had lostordinary common sense. 
 We refuse to be intimidated by thefact that our enemies rejoice at our slips. 
 Our sole strategy now is to become stronger, hence cleverer, more sensible, more “opportunistic”, and that is what we must tell the masses. 
 But after we shall have won over themasses by our reasonableness, we shall use the tactic ofoffensive in the strictest sense of that word. 
 Now about the three reports: 1) The strike of Berlin’s municipal workers. 
 Municipal workers are mostly conservative people, who belong to the Social -Democrats of the majority and to the Independent Social -Democratic Party; they are well off, but are compelled to strike. 
378 2) The strike of the textile workers in Lille. 
379 3) The third fact is the most important. 
 A meeting was held in Rome to organise the struggle against the fascists, in which 50,000 workers took part—representing all parties—Communists, socialists and also republicans. 
 Five thou -sand ex -servicemen came to the meeting in their uniforms and not a single fascist dared to appear on the street. 
380 This shows that there is more inflammable material in Europe than we thought. 
 Lazzari praised our resolution on tactics. 
 It is an *See Vol. 
 24 of this edition, pp. 
 210 -11. 
— Ed. 
 important achievement of our congress. 
 If Lazzari admits it, then the thousands of workers who back him are bound to come to us, and their leaders will not be able to scare them away from us. 
 “Il faut reculer, pour mieux sauter”(you have to step back to make a better jump). 
 This jumpis inevitable, since the situation, objectively, is becominginsufferable. 
 So we are beginning to apply our new tactic. 
 We mustn’t get nervy, we cannot be late, rather we may start too early, and when you ask whether Russia will be able to hold out solong, we answer that we are now fighting a war with thepetty bourgeoisie, with the peasantry, an economic war,which is much more dangerous for us than the last war. 
 Butas Clausewitz said, the element of war is a danger and we have never been out of that danger for a moment. 
 I am sure that if we act more cautiously, if we make concessions intime, we shall win this war too, even if it lasts over threeyears. 
 Summing up: 1) All of us, unanimously throughout Europe, shall say that we are applying the new tactic, and in this way we shall win the masses. 
 2) Co -ordination of the offensive in the most important countries: Germany, Czechoslovakia, Italy. 
 We need herepreparation, constant co -ordination. 
 Europe is pregnant with revolution, but it is impossible to make up a calendar of revolution beforehand. 
 We in Russia will hold out, not only five years, but more. 
 The only correct strategy is theone we have adopted. 
 I am confident that we shall win posi -tions for the revolution which the Entente will have nothingto put up against, and that will be the beginning of victoryon a world scale. 
 2 "meral seemed to be pleased with my speech, but he inter -prets it one -sidedly. 
 I said in the committee that in order to find the correct line "meral had to make three steps to the left, and Kreibich one step to the right. 
 "meral, unfortu -nately, said nothing about taking these steps. 
 Nor did he say anything about his views on the situation. 
 Concerning the difficulties, "meral merely repeated the old arguments and said nothing new. 
 "meral said that I had dispelled his fears. 
 In the spring he was afraid that the communist leader -ship would demand of him untimely action, but events dispelled these fears. 
 But what worries us now is this: willthings really come to the stage of preparation for the offen -sive in Czechoslovakia, or will they be confined merely totalk about difficulties. 
 The Left mistake is simply a mistake, it isn’t big and is easily rectified. 
 But if the mistake pertains to the resolution to act, then this is by no means a smallmistake, it is a betrayal. 
 These mistakes do not bear compar -ison. 
 The theory that we shall make a revolution, but onlyafter others have acted first, is utterly fallacious. 
 3 The retreat made at this congress can, I think, be com -pared with our actions in 1917 in Russia, and therefore provethat this retreat must serve as preparation for the offensive. 
 Our opponents will say that we are not saying today what we said before. 
 It will do them little good, but the working -class masses will understand us if we tell them in what sensethe March action is to be considered a success and why wecriticise its mistakes and say that we should make betterpreparations in future. 
 I agree with Terracini when he says that the interpretations of "meral and Burian are wrong. 
 If co -ordination is to be understood as our having to wait until another country has started, a country that is richerand has a bigger population, then this is not a communistinterpretation, but downright deception. 
 Co -ordination should consist in comrades from other countries knowing exactly what moments are significant. 
 The really important interpretation of co -ordination is this: the best and quickest imitation of a good example. 
 That of the workers of Romeis a good example.

1921 Lenin First published in 1932 Printed from the manuscript in Lenin Miscellany XX NOTE S ON MEASURE S FOR COMBATIN G FAMINE AND STEPPIN G UP ECONOMI C WOR K383 If an area affected by crop failure and famine embraces a territory with a population of twenty -five million, should we not, by a number of revolutionary measures, take young men into the army from this particular area to the number of about 500,000 (or even perhaps up to 1million?). 
 Purpose: to help out the famine -stricken population to some extent, as we shall feed some of them and perhaps helpothers by means of parcels which the men will send home. 
That is one thing. 
 Secondly: locate these half a million in the Ukraine, where they can help to step up food supply work, in which they are deeply concerned, keenly aware as theyare of the injustice of the gluttony practised by the richpeasants in the Ukraine. 
 The harvest in the Ukraine is estimated roughly (Rakov -sky) at 550 -650 million poods. 
 Deducting 150 million poods for sowing and 300 (15 8 20=300) for feeding the family and the farm animals, we get a balance (550—450 =100 ; 650—450 =200 ) at an average of about 150 million poods. 
 If we post an army from the famine -stricken gubernias in the Ukraine this balance (tax &barter &special requisi -tions from the rich to help the starving) could be collected in full . 
 Measures should immediately be stepped up in the famine -stricken gubernias to collect raw materials (hides, hoofs, horns, bristles, etc. 
, etc. 
) and it should be made a rule,incidentally, that not a pood of relief should be renderedeither for seed or food unless payment is made in one or another form of raw materials or fallen wood fuel or similar stuff.

 central departments be assigned to each of these economic conferences? These groups of, say, four people, could work together as a team, being selected from among the staff of one and the same central institution or being well acquaintedwith each other, and they could do regular work in theseeconomic councils, say, an hour a day each, making 3 -4 hours a day together? The complete or partial transfer of workers of the non -economic commissariats to economic work could be arrangedin this way: their work at the commissariat could be shiftedto the extent of three -fourths or nine -tenths to third -rate assistants, whom they could supervise. 
 In Moscow (and afterwards in other places) all top-level Party workers should be mobilised for economic work in this way: every top -level Party worker of a non-economic commis -sariat takes a low-level economic job, for which purpose he joins some factory committee (or house or block commit -tee)— no organisation higher than that (in order to work at low-level)—and undertakes to devote no less than two hours a day to this work. 
 Priority is to be given to the work of distributing foodstuffs, raising the level of the economicbranch concerned, and fuel supply. 
 It is important that each worker’s assignment should be precisely defined.

 ZINOVIEV AND INSTRUCTIONS TO THE SECRETARY 1) Radek 2) me Type 6 copies 3) Trotskyand send to 4) Kamenev 5) Stalin6) extra copy To Comrade Zinoviev 13/VIII -1921 Obviously, we cannot properly organise in Russia a bureau for properly summarising and selecting information on theinternational labour movement. 
 We haven’t the people forit, nor the libraries, etc. 
 I suggest that such a bureau be set up in Germany. 
Employ one manager (a non -work -fit Communist, better still a non-Communist) plus 2 assistants ( &2—3 typists). 
PNMNQ A definite monthly sum should be earmarked for this purpose. 
 We should try to arrange legally , under some trade name, something like Zeitungskorrespondenz , a supply of articles and copy to the newspapers. 
 Three Germans (knowing English, French, Italian and Czech—enough to start with) could of course be found. 
Radek, if I am not mistaken, even had someone in mind. 
 This bureau, if we could find efficient men to run it under contract (intellectuals in Germany are hard up, and we could select a good staff), would carry on systematic researchwork for us in collecting literary and special newspaper material and working it up on two cardinal and main points: A)international imperialism ; B)the international labour movement . 
 We could (with Radek and with his help) probably find 2 -3 dozen Communists doing journalistic work in all countriesto act as contributors (and writer -consultants) to this bureau. 
 Such a bureau would work for a start in German (for the continent of Europe now undoubtedly the most internationallanguage); and at the first opportunity it would add to itspublications translations into French and English. 
 Russiantranslations could easily be arranged: we would simply givethe job through official state channels to 2 -3 bourgeois pro -fessors, so as not to divert communist forces on purelytechnical work. 
 On both these questions ( A and B) the bureau should systematically keep abreast of the international literature,especially newspaper literature, and compile lists of valuable books and newspaper articles on these questions. 
 The most important thing here would be to detail and arrange these questions correctly—to compile a rational and classified list of these questions and supplement it in good time according to the needs of the moment. 
 And then—commentaries of not more than 3 -10 lines on books and on very rare and specially important newspaper articles (1 out of 100, or maybe 1 out of 500), so that you can tell at once what to look for and what the respectivebook or article deals with. 
 The writer -consultants could write these commentaries (or rather a statement of the contents) easily, if the German centre organised this work and paid them for it. 
 Further, the bureau should run a summary of important items of information from thenewspapers and press -cuttings (at least 3 -4 sets to begin with: one for the files, one for Moscow, and one extra setto meet any contingency). 
 With the help of consultants and Radek at their head, we could make up a list of subjects, for example:— — shadings and controversial issues within communism:— — ”” ” and on the fringe of communism (II 2* and anarchists); — — ”” ” also within the trade union movement; —— elections and their statistics (or results) to judgethe strength of the trends in the labour movement;—— the history of outstanding strikes and “incidents”(demonstrations, actions, etc. 
) and so on. 
 I believe that, properly organised, this bureau would bring in a certain income, as its bulletins would be purchasedby certain newspapers and libraries as important informationmaterial. 
 But this income, of course, would at best cover only a small part of the expenses. 
 We can and should bear these expenses. 
 All the material, as far as we are concerned, will serve the cause of public education and the work of propa -ganda and agitation. 
 Such a bureau can and should be organised. 
 It can be very useful. 
 Without it we have no eyes, ears or hands for par -ticipation in the international movement—and we do it casually always dependent (for information) on someone who is closer near at hand, who has happened to read about it,who has just dropped in, happened to mention it, and so on. 
 I propose that the Politbureau discuss this plan and set up a small commission for its preliminary drafting, say: Radek Trotsky & ? *Meaning the Centrist II 2 International. 
— Ed. 
 Perhaps only two would be better to start with. 
 They can enlist the co-operation of Steklov and Béla Kun (and many others), invite to Moscow a candidate for the post of bureau manager , and then be able to make up an estimate and submit the whole elaborated plan to the Politbureau for consideration.

 Dictated over the telephone August 26, 1921 First published in 1945 Printed from the typed copy in Lenin Miscellany XXXV A NOTE TO E. 
 VARGA AND THESES ON THE ORGANISATION OF AN INFORMATION INSTITUTE ON QUESTIONS OF THE INTERNATIONAL LABOUR MOVEMENT Dear Comrade Varga, I enclose my remarks. 
 If you think it necessary, we can talk things over on the telephone. 
 Best regards, Lenin 31/8 Tentative Amendments or Theses To Comrade E. 
 Varga’s Project for the Organisation of an Information Institute 1. 
 Absolute and strict legality of the Institute for Berlin or Vienna conditions and for the whole of Western Europe,Britain and America. 
 2. 
 Headquarters of the Institute—Berlin or Vienna or Copenhagen or Christiania. 
 3. 
 No more than 20% of the Institute’s working time and publications should be devoted to economic and socialquestions (both together 20%). 
 80% to political questions. 
 4. 
 As far as political questions are concerned, the task of the Institute is only to collect objective data on questions that are legal and open to discussion. 
 5. 
 The Institute must be completely independent of the respective Communist Parties. 
 6. 
 The official name of the Institute should be, tenta -tively: Institute for the Study of Forms of Social Movement. 
 7. 
 Instructions of a principle nature are to be given to the head (or to three heads, not more) of the Institute. 
 8. 
 On the basis of verbal instructions of a principle nature the head is to work out detailed and absolutely legalinstructions and submit them here in Moscow for endorse -ment by the Comintern Executive. 
 9. 
 Reports to be submitted weekly or twice a week. 
 Socio -economic appendixes monthly or tri -monthly. 
 10. 
 The Institute must have no contacts whatever with the Russian embassies. 
 11. 
 The Institute must begin in a small way. 
 For the German -speaking countries, Scandinavia and the Slav countries—only the German language. 
 Activities may be extended to Anglo -Saxon and Romance countries only on the basis of a special agreement with a representative of each group of these countries. 
 Agreementonly here in Moscow. 
 12. 
 The reports, or rather, publications, or correspondence of the Institute should be paid for by subscribers (newspaperslibraries, etc. 
). 
 The basic principle should be—such an organisation of the Institute and such operation as would compel all labour newspapers of all trends to subscribe to the Institute’s publications and pay for them. 
 If this does nothappen, it will be proof that the Institute is worthless. 
 13. 
 Comrade Varga’s project 390 should serve as initial draft instructions. 
 In particular, two basic amendments to this project are needed: 1) §3— up; 2) the political part should be considerably elaborated. 
 Some remarks to this Point 2:(Appendix B. 
) §§3 and 4: Correspondence from factories? &money collected by the workers themselves? &questions of the trade union movement should be specially dealt with in detail from the political angle. 
Winning the trade unions is one of the most importantpolitical issues. 
 &workers’ co -operatives: ditto (to Section II, b) &all transitional political formations (like the workers’ and farmers’ party in the United States) are especially important. 
 &Leaflets? Distribution? Circulation? &attitude to the 1914 -18 war? Extremely important. 
 Section II, §a “revolutionary” (??) workers’ parties like the Communist Workers’ Party of Germany. 
 Name is wrong. 
 They are not revolutionary. 
 They should be called: semi -anarchist, anarchist or near -anarchist. 
 It is necessary to add: a split of anarchism all over the world in patriotic and internationalist questions; for the Soviet system; against the Soviet system. 
 (§b). 
 Parties of the II and II 2 Internationals— much more detailed . 
 &attitude to own colonies—and to imperialism in practical politics— much , much more detailed . 
 &all pacifist and petty -bourgeois -democratic groups and trends— much more detailed . 
 And so on.

 54 TO E. 
 VARGA Dear Comrade Varga, I consider it incorrect to put the question that way (supplying information to the Comintern Executive or t o the labour press or to both?). 
 We need full and truthful information. 
 And the truth should not depend upon whom it has to serve. 
 We can accept only the division into unofficial infor -mation (for the Comintern Executive only) and official information (for everybody). 
 The former already exists and must exist separately ; it must be improved. 
 The latter, to become good, requires good organisation in the selection of facts without a declaration that “we” are Communists. 
 If the selection of facts is full, exact and good, then the yellow labour press, too (especially the local and trade union newspapers) will certainly buy and pay for our material. 
 If that does not happen it will be evidence of our poor legal work.

 If you are agreeable, put it to them. 
 Find a reliable interpreter (for all negotiations) who knows both languages well . 
 An agreement is essential, and it must be very precisely worded. 
 We must get our own lawyer (a Communist) to draw it up. 
 I suggest it be called an agreement for handing over the management of a number of factories, etc. 
 The technical examination results should be signed by Stunkel and several other experts of repute . 
 With communist greetings, Lenin Do the leaders and organisers of the enterprise agree to sign the following engagement and obtain the signatures of all the other people going to Russia from America: 1. 
 We undertake to see to it and collectively answer for it that only such people shall go to Russia as are capable and willing to face a number of severe hardships involved in the rehabilitation of industry in a very backward andutterly ruined country. 
 2. 
 Those going to Russia undertake to work their hardest and with the greatest efficiency and discipline exceedingthose of capitalist standards, as otherwise Russia will not be able to outstrip capitalism or even catch up with it. 
 3. 
 We undertake, in the event of any conflicts whatsoever to submit them for settlement to the supreme Sovietauthority of Russia and faithfully abide by its decisions.

1921 Comrade Molotov, I enclose material on the Rutgers business. 
It is for the Council of Labour and Defence to decide. 
 I suggest that it first be decided in the C. 
C. 
— it is a political question. 
 And the Politbureau must have its say, as it is a gold spending. 
]] ^^ Please get the secretary to telephone all the members of the Politbureau who will each arrange for one hour in the course of which he will be able to familiarise himself with the material before Friday. 
 Each one must look throughit so that it can be settled on Friday. 
 Let the secretary make up a time -table and send the material round to each member of the Politbureau. 
 A difficult question: for: if the Americans keep their word, it will be of tremendous benefit. 
 In that case we shall not grudge 600,000 gold rubles. 
 against: will they keep their word? Heywood is half -anarchist. 
 More sentimental than business -like. 
 Rutgers may succumb to Leftism. 
 Calvert is highly garrulous. 
 We have no business guarantees whatever. 
 Enthusiastic people,in an atmosphere of unemployment, may recruit a group of“adventurous spirits” who will end up in squabbles. 
 Wemay then lose part of our 600,000 gold rubles (they will, of course, spoil and waste some of the property) and risk losing up to 1 million gold rubles more , because under §8 (the end of it) we undertake “to reimburse the equivalent of expenditures on machines and tools brought in by the said emigrant”. 
 No small risk. 
 For: Smirnov I. 
 N. 
 and Maximov (of the Urals) are local people, and they are for it. 
 Against: Martens should know the Americans well, and he is against.

 But I should like to try a thing like this: to make him modify the group (Rutgers & Heywood & Calvert). 
 And modify the financial terms, too.

 Written October 19, 1921 First published in 1959 Printed from the manuscript in Lenin Miscellany XXXVI A LETTER TO THE POLISH COMMUNISTS 19. 
X. 
1921 Dear Comrades, Judging by the scrappy information concerning the growth of the communist movement in Poland that reachesour newspapers, and judging (still more) by the reports of some very prominent Polish comrades, the revolution in Poland is coming to a head. 
 A workers’ revolution is brewing: the complete collapse of the P. 
P. 
S. 
 * (in Russian—S. 
R. 
s and Mensheviks; in European—the II and II 2 Internationals). 
 The trade unions, one after another, are joining the Communists. 
 The growth of demonstrations, and so on. 
 Imminent and inevitable financial collapse. 
 The gigantic failure of bour -geois democracy (and of the petty bourgeoisie) in Poland withthe agrarian reform, a failure that is foredoomed, inevitable,and bound to push the majority of the rural population—thewhole poor section of the peasantry—towards the Communists. 
 Financial collapse and shameless plunder of Poland by Entente capital (France and other countries) are bringingwith them a practical exposure of national and Great Powerillusions, an exposure that is strikingly clear and tangibleto the masses , to the rank -and-file worker, to the rank -and-file peasant. 
 If this is so, then the revolution (Soviet revolution) in Poland is bound to win, and win soon. 
 That being thecase, the Government and the bourgeoisie must be preventedfrom strangling the revolution by bloody suppression of apremature uprising. 
 You must not be provoked. 
 You must wait for the tide to rise to its highest: it will sweep everything away and give victory to the Communists. 
 If the bourgeoisie kills 100 -300 people, this will not ruin the cause. 
 But if it is able to provoke a massacre, to kill10 -30 thousand workers, this may delay the revolution even for several years . 
 If it is important for the Government to hold elections to the Seim, then an effort should be made for the Seim to *P. 
P. 
S. 
—the Polish Socialist Party. 
— Ed. 
 be won by the wave of the workers’ revolution and the peasants’ discontent. 
 Do not yield to provocation. 
 The revolution must be allowed to grow to full ripening of the fruit. 
 The victory of Soviet power from within Poland will be a gigantic international victory. 
 If Soviet power has, in my opinion, now won an international victory to the extent of 20-30 per cent, then with the victory of Soviet power from within Poland, we shall have a 40-50, perhaps even 51 per cent international victory of the communist revolution. 
 For Poland is next door to Germany, Czecho -slovakia and Hungary, and a Soviet Poland will unde r-mine the whole regime built up on the peace of Versailles. 
 That is why the Polish Communists bear a responsibility before the whole world—that of keeping a firm grip on the helm of their ship and steering clear of provocations. 
 Is it worth while retaliating for the beating up of Dabål by Daszynski & Co. 
? Retaliation, if any, should be by beating up Daszynski, just like that, without any shooting or wounding. 
 It may be worth while if it has the effect of teaching an insolent fellow a lesson at the hands of the workers, and stiffening the workers’ spirit at the cost of a sacrifice of 5-10 of them (by imprisonment or execution). 
 But maybe it is not worth while: would not the fact that our Dåbal had been brutally beaten up be more useful for the purpose of agitation among the peasant s? Would it not be more effective in turning the sympathy of the backward peasants towards us than the thrashing of Daszynski? This should be weighed more carefully.

419 Written November 18, 1921 First publishe d in 1945 Printe d from the manuscript in Leni n Miscellany XXXV TALK WITH A DELEGATION OF THE MONGOLIA N PEOPLE’ S REPUBL IC420 NOVEMBER 5, 1921 1st question of the Mongolian delegation: “Comrade Lenin, what do you think about the establishment of a People’s Revolutionary Party in our country and what is most important for us?” Comrade Lenin outlined to our delegation our country’s international situation and pointed out that owing to the M. 
P. 
R. 
’s geographical position the imperialist powers, incase of war, would try to seize our country and use it asa jumping -off ground for military operations against another country. 
 Therefore, Lenin said, the only right way forevery working person in your country was to fight for stateand economic independence in alliance with the workersand peasants of Soviet Russia. 
 This fight could not becarried on isolatedly, therefore the establishment of a partyof Mongolian arats was a pledge of success in their struggle. 
 The Mongolian delegation’s second question: “Will the national liberation struggle be victorious?” Comrade Lenin’s answer: “I have been in the revolutionary movement myself for thirty years and I know by experience how difficult it is for any people to liberate themselves from their externaland internal enslavers. 
 Although Mongolia is a cattle -breeding country and the bulk of her population are nomadherdsmen, she has achieved great progress in her revolution,and most important of all, has made good these successes bycreating a People’s Revolutionary Party of her own, whoseaim is to become a mass party uncluttered by alien elements. 
” The Mongolian delegation’s third question: “Ought not the People’s Revolutionary Party be transformed into a Communist Party? ” Comrade Lenin’s reply: “I should not recommend it, because one party cannot be ‘transformed’ into another. 
” Comrade Lenin explainedthe essence of a Communist Party as a party of the prole -tariat, and said: “The revolutionaries will have to put ina good deal of work in developing state, economic andcultural activities before the herdsman elements become a proletarian mass, which may eventually help to ‘transform’ the People’s Revolutionary Party into a Communist Party. 
A mere change of signboards is harmful and dangerous. 
” Comrade Lenin elaborated on the idea that it was possible and necessary for the M. 
P. 
R. 
 to follow a non -capitalist path of development, the main condition for which was hard work on the part of the People’s Revolutionary Party and the Government, so that this work and the increasedinfluence of the Party and the authorities would resultin a growth of the number of co -operatives, in the intro -duction of new forms of economic activity and nationalculture, and would rally the arats behind the Party and the Government in the interests of the country’s economic and cultural development. 
 It was only from the islets ofthe new economic way of life created by the efforts of theParty and the Government that the new non -capitalist economic system of arat Mongolia would take shape.

 Comrade Tsyurupa, My plan has matured: In addition to the post of Deputy Chairman of the Council of Labour and Defence held by Rykov (with the right ofcasting vote in the Council of People’s Commissars) the postof second deputy chairman of the C. 
L. 
D. 
 is instituted onequal terms. 
 Tsyurupa is appointed to this post and released from the Food Commissariat. 
 The rights of these deputies: a casting vote in the C.

 and the C. 
L. 
D. 
 ; the chairing of the meetings in the absence of the chairman. 
 All the rights of C.

 chairman as far as participation in all boards and institutions is concerned,and (inter alia) the right to give instructions in regard to the practical work (subject to immediate execution) to People’s Commissars and to members of their boards, etc. 
(with the knowledge and consent of the commissars of thegovernment departments concerned) on questions pertaining to the integration and direction of the economic com -missariats’ activities. 
 That is how I conceive the official decision of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee . 
430 The task is to integrate and improve the economic work AS A WHOLE, especially in connection with and through the State Bank (trade) and the State Planning Commission . 
 To make a first-hand study of the specific features and work of all the economic commissariats and an acquaintancewith all the members of their boards and a number (10 -100) of local and regional top workers in this field. 
 To personally attend important board meetings of the respective commissariats, the State Planning Commission, the State Bank, Centrosoyuz, etc. 
 and check personally , at the choice of the Deputy Chairmen of the C. 
L. 
D. 
, those functions which are considered most vital or of special topicality. 
 For how long these posts will be, “we shall see”: perhaps 3-4 years, perhaps 30 years. 
 One of the objects is to develop a highly trained type of instructor -inspector to check and organise all economic work at all economic institutions centrally and locally. 
 The deputy chairmen conduct their work through the apparatus of the existing commissariats, having only the Managing Department of the C. 
L. 
D. 
 as their own body (4-5 C. 
L. 
D. 
 business managers with 1 -2 assistants and 1 -2 secretaries to each assistant).

 The paragraph on the history of Bolshevism should be amplified and partly modified. 
 It is incorrect to saythere was a split only in 1910. 
 It should be stated that the formal splits with the Mensheviks in the spring of 1905 and in January 1912 alternated with the semi -unity and unity of 1906 and 1907 followed by that of 1910 not onlybecause of the vicissitudes of the struggle but also underpressure from the rank and file, who demanded check teststhrough their own experience. 
 I think this should be stated more explicitly and concretely on one page.

 112 notes COMMENTS ON THE DRAFT RESOLUTION FOR THE ELEVENTH CONFERENCE OF THE R. 
C. 
P. 
 (B. 
) ON THE PARTY PURGE With regard to Zalutsky’s draft resolution on the Party purge I would like to make two remarks. 
 1) In section 3 §a Zalutsky proposes that enrolment into the Party be suspended for 6 months. 
 I think this iswrong. 
 I would propose, on my part, not to suspend enrol -ment, but to lay down stricter conditions, namely: a longterm of probation. 
 If an eighteen -month term for real workers is considered too long, it can be reduced, say, to nine, or even six months, as Trotsky proposes. 
 In the case of such short terms, however, I think we should require a qualified majority in the bodies making enrolment decisions, for instance, that it should require a majority of not less than four-fifths to have the term of enrolment reduced, this four-fifths majority to be demanded not only from one Party body (the local cell making the admission), but from several bodies for the sake of mutual control (for example, from the Gubernia Party Committee in addition to the local cell, and so on). 
 I would have nothing whatever against admission into the Party being made easier for genuine workers, but unless very strict conditions are laid down for determining who is to be considered a worker of large industry, we shall immediately find a mass of riff-raff crawling through the hole again. 
 As regards Red Armymen, I think we should have stricter conditions, since, for one thing, most of them are not workers, but peasants, and secondly, these people are too young and need testing. 
 2)In Section 4 §a Zalutsky proposes a revision of the plans of work among the Young Communist League. 
 I believe stricter conditions should be laid down on this point to make sure that the members of the Y. 
C. 
L. 
 admitted to membe r-ship of the Party have, first, really studied seriously and learnt something, and secondly, that they have a long record of serious practical work (economic, cultural, etc. 
) . 
437 Lenin Dictate d over the telephone Decembe r 22, 1921 First publishe d in 1959 Printe d from the secretary in Leni n Miscellany XXXV I note s (type d copy) SPEECHES AT A MEETING OF NON-PARTY DELEGATES TO THE NINTH ALL-RUSSIA CONGRESS OF SOVIETS DECEMBER 26, 1921438 1 Comrades, having decided to continue our talk—I think we have no doubts on this score—I just want to say that it is now about half past eight and we can sit on till halfpast nine or even later. 
 We must pick a question which we /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR are most interested in. 
 If, as one comrade said here, it is the agrarian question, then I say—let us distribute our time on those questions which are most important for you. 
 My business here, as I understand it, is mainly to listenand make notes. 
 What I wanted to tell you I have alreadytold you at the congress. 
 I am trying to take down notesas to what gubernia, what uyezd the complaints come fromand what most of them are about. 
 I think the time should be distributed in such a way that after the question of compulsory carting tax has been dealt with, we shouldfigure out what questions seem most important so thatdelegates from different gubernias can have time to havetheir say on them. 
 My business here is to make as detailednotes as possible in order to know what the non -Party delegates have spoken about. 
 In any case, it will be very difficult for me to answer some of the questions that willbe put here, as I have no information at hand and cannotgive an immediate reply. 
 That is why I suggest choosingquestions which are considered the most important andon which delegates will speak from the floor, the way the carting tax question has been raised, and I shall write down every statement made by local people. 
 2 Comrades, it is very difficult for me to say even a few words on this question, because all the questions that have been put here I am writing down with a note of what guber -nia they come from, but without exact information fromthe institution concerned I am unable straight off to answerthe questions that have been put here. 
 The comrade fromthe Commissariat for Labour who has just spoken, found it much easier because he has before his eyes a published law and an explanation of what mitigations the enforcementof that law will yield. 
 Without information from thecommissariats concerned I can give no definite answersto some of the questions that have been put here. 
 A number of notes have been sent up. 
 One of them is from a Ukrainian comrade from Kiev, who asks why I have never visited the Ukraine. 
 It is a long journey to the Ukraine,and a difficult one to undertake. 
 One comrade asks, who is going to pay for the horses killed in the carting service. 
 I have made a note of that question. 
 The comrade has already answered in a general way. 
 Two notes have been handed up on the question of the tax in kind and about it being impossible for the needypeasant to buy textile goods. 
 Naturally, the peasants inall gubernias these days have many difficulties like these to bear. 
 Without information from the institution concerned I am unable to answer this sort of question just now. 
 Can we help and to what extent can we help? I repeat, that at the moment I can give no reply. 
 It seems to me thatthe most important thing that has been said here on thequestion of carting service is—as far as I can gather from a glance at my notes (and I have written down briefly what each of the comrades has said here)—the most impor -tant thing, to my mind, are the instances of abuse andirregularities on the part of the Zheleskoms. 
 439 Most of the complaints have been about the stints assigned by theZheleskoms being heavy, about the hard time peasants are having, about there being far too many irregularities in the distribution and assignment of jobs, especially ata time when they are simply harmful to the peasants’ farmwork. 
 I have made notes of all these remarks, and a note thatwhen the last three -week campaign was held, all comrades from the centre were sent out to the local areas. 
 I asked for exact information on all irregularities connected with fuel work, and on all abuses, as well as a number of reports to be col -lected. 
 I have already begun to receive letters about this, butrecently, owing to ill -health, which made me confine myself only to a general report at the congress, I have not beenable to deal with these letters myself. 
 This will be entrusted to another comrade, who is temporarily taking my place, but we shall definitely collect all the information that hascome in during the last three -week campaign. 
 The complaints about the irregularities and abuses of the ZheleskomsI consider, on the whole, undoubtedly correct. 
 One of theprincipal reasons why it was decided to introduce the carting tax which the comrade from the Labour Commissariat has spoken about here is that, unless the amount of workto be done is properly determined (this attempt is being made by the fixing of a six -day period of work in the law), unless this is properly determined in the law, abuses by the gubernia logging committees and the Zheleskoms are bound to take place and will be very difficult to combat. 
 But whenthe law definitely declares, as it now does, how many workdays are required and there will be a known set task fixinghow much work is to be done in the given number of days,the abuses will be much easier to combat. 
 Naturally, the fight against abuses by these bodies in the gubernias and uyezds is no easy job, especially when, as a comrade herepointed out, many of the old employees, the former land -owners and former timber contractors have wormed theirway into these bodies. 
 A stricter eye must be kept on thisin the local areas and we must have more comrades from among the non -Party peasants in the Central Executive Committee, who could be applied to in the event of a com -plaint failing to reach its destination, and who would raisethe question at a sitting of the C. 
E. 
C. 
 and demand aninvestigation into the abuses. 
 These measures will be putthrough at this congress in any case. 
 The number of C. 
E. 
C. 
 members from among the non -Party peasants, as comrades taking part in the congress have told me, will definitelybe increased. 
 By this means it will be possible to keepan eye on abuses by the Zheleskoms and easier to combatthem when there will be more non -Party peasant members in the C. 
E. 
C. 
 I repeat, I am making a note of all the remarks that are made here and shall write to the appropriate com -missariat or economic council about each of them in order to have proper measures taken. 
 I cannot of course givea reply offhand to each particular question without gettingthe information from the commissariat concerned. 
 3 I have asked Comrade Kalinin for two minutes to clear up any misunderstanding that his words may have caused. 
440 I am sure he did not intend to impute to me the idea that I ever suggested burning prayer -books. 
 Needless to say, I never suggested such a thing and never could. 
 You knowthat according to our Constitution, the fundamental law of our Republic, freedom of conscience in respect of religion is fully guaranteed to every person. 
 Another word to the comrade who spoke about the very difficult situation in some of the uyezds of Vyatka Gubernia. 
 These uyezds are in the famin e-stricken area. 
 Our main hope now will be in the agreement which the American Gover n-ment has offered us. 
 We shall conclude it within the next few days. 
 Under this agreement the American Government offers twenty million dollars. 
 We shall give ten million, making thirty million dollars altogether—that is, sixty million gold rubles. 
 This is a sizable sum. 
 Most of the spring crop area, if not all of it, will be sown. 
 In addition we are sending men to Canada. 
 I think we shall be able to spend an extra sum from the gold fund to buy a little more seed. 
 The main problem now, of course, is the famine, the dearth of fodder. 
 The sowing of spring crops must be done as fully as possible. 
 Every effort in this direction will be made.

1921 considered the question of the role and functions of the trade unions under the New Economic Policy. 
 The plenum heard thereports of Comrades Rudzutak, Andreyev and Shlyapnikov (the planned report by Comrade Lutovinov was not made owing to failure to call the reporter out in time). 
 Afteran exchange of opinions it was decided to submit theoriginal draft theses of Comrades Rudzutak and Andreyevto a committee of these two comrades with the additionof Lenin and to charge this committee with drafting theses for endorsement by the Politbureau. 
 (Several lines will be added to this after approval of the draft by the committee and then the Politbureau. 
) DRAFT 1. 
 THE NEW ECONOMIC POLICY AND THE TRADE UNIONS The New Economic Policy introduces a number of important changes in the position of the proletariat and, consequently,in that of the trade unions. 
 These changes are due to the fact that in their entire policy of transition from capitalism to socialism the Communist Party and the Soviet govern -ment are now adopting special methods to implement thistransition and in many respects are operating differentlyfrom the way they operated before: they are capturinga number of positions by a “new flanking movement”, so to speak; they are drawing back in order to make better prepara -tions for a new offensive against capitalism. 
 In particular, a free market and capitalism, both subject to state control,are now being permitted and are developing; on the otherhand, the state enterprises are being put on what is calleda profit basis, i. 
e. 
, they are in effect being largely re -organised on commercial and capitalist lines. 
 2. 
 STATE CAPITALISM IN THE PROLETARIAN STATE AND THE TRADE UNIONS The proletarian state may, without changing its own nature, permit freedom of trade and the development of capitalism only within certain bounds, and only on thecondition that the state regulates (supervises, controls,determines the forms and methods of, etc. 
) private tradeand private capitalism. 
 The success of such regulation willdepend not only on the state authorities, but also, and to a larger extent, on the degree of maturity of the prole -tariat and of the masses of the working people generally, on their cultural level, etc. 
 But even if this regulation iscompletely successful, the antagonism of class interestsbetween labour and capital will certainly remain. 
 Conse -quently, one of the main tasks that will henceforth confront the trade unions is to protect in every way the class interests of the proletariat in its struggle against capital. 
 This taskshould be openly put in the forefront, and the machinery of the trade unions must be reorganised, modified or supple -mented accordingly; strike funds, and so on should be formed, or rather, built up. 
 3. 
 THE STATE ENTERPRISES THAT ARE BEING PUT ON A PROFIT BASIS AND THE TRADE UNIONS The conversion of state enterprises to what is called the profit basis is inevitably and inseparably connected with the New Economic Policy; in the near future this is boundto become the predominant, if not the sole, form of stateenterprise. 
 Actually, this means that with the free marketnow permitted and developing, the state enterprises, willto a large extent be put on a commercial, capitalist basis. 
 This circumstance, in view of the urgent need to increase the productivity of labour and make every state enterprisepay its way and show a profit, and in view of the inevitablerise of narrow departmental interests and excessive depart -mental zeal, is bound to create a certain conflict of interestsbetween the masses of workers and the directors and managers of the state enterprises, or the government departments in charge of them. 
 Therefore, it is undoubtedly the dutyof the trade unions, in regard to the state enterprises as well,to protect the class interests of the proletariat and theworking masses against their employers. 
 4. 
 THE ESSENTIAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CLASS STRUGGLE OF THE PROLETARIAT IN A STATE WHICH RECOGNISES PRIVATE OWNERSHIP OF THE LAND, FACTORIES, ETC. 
, AND WHERE POLITICAL POWER IS IN THE HANDS OF THE CAPITALIST CLASS, AND THE CLASS STRUGGLE OF THE PROLETARIAT IN A STATE WHICH DOES NOT RECOGNISE PRIVATE OWNERSHIP OF THE LAND AND THE MAJORITY OF THE LARGE ENTERPRISES AND WHERE POLITICAL POWER IS IN THE HANDS OF THE PROLETARIAT As long as classes exist, the class struggle is inevitable. 
 In the period of transition from capitalism to socialism theexistence of classes is inevitable; and the Programme of the Russian Communist Party definitely states that we are taking only the first steps in the transition from capitalism to socialism. 
 Hence, the Communist Party, the Soviet government and the trade unions must frankly admit theexistence of a class struggle and its inevitability until theelectrification of industry and agriculture is completed—at least in the main—and until small production and thesupremacy of the market are thereby cut off at the roots. 
 It follows from this that at the present moment we can under no circumstances abandon the idea of the strikestruggle, we cannot, as a matter of principle, conceive thepossibility of a law that makes compulsory state mediationtake the place of strikes. 
 On the other hand, it is obvious that under capitalism the ultimate object of the strike struggle is to break up the state machine and to overthrow the given class state power. 
Under the transitional type of proletarian state such asours, however, the ultimate object of the strike strugglecan only be to fortify the proletarian state and the statepower of the proletarian class by combating the bureaucratic distortions, mistakes and flaws in this state, and by curbing the class appetites of the capitalists who try to evade itscontrol, etc. 
 Hence, the Communist Party, the Sovietgovernment and the trade unions must never forget and mustnever conceal from the workers and the mass of the workingpeople that the strike struggle in a state where the prole -tariat holds political power can be explained and justifiedonly by the bureaucratic distortions of the proletarian stateand by all sorts of survivals of the old capitalist system inthe government offices on the one hand, and by the politicalimmaturity and cultural backwardness of the mass of theworking people on the other. 
 When the law courts and all other organs of the state are built on a class basis, by the working people themselves, with the bourgeoisieexcluded from the electorate, the normal method of settlingconflicts between labour and capital, between employedand employers, will more and more often find expressionin the working people turning directly to the state authorities. 
 5. 
 REVERSION TO VOLUNTARY TRADE UNION MEMBERSHIP The compulsory wholesale signing up of all workers for membership in the trade unions is no longer consistent withthe present degree of socialisation achieved in industryor with the level of development of the masses. 
 Compulsory membership has moreover introduced a certain degree of bureaucratic distortion into the trade unions themselves. 
It is absolutely essential to revert for a fairly considerablelength of time to the practice of voluntary membershipin the trade unions. 
 Under no circumstances must tradeunion members be required to subscribe to any specific political views; in this respect, as well as in respect of religion, the trade unions must be non -partisan. 
 All that must be required of trade union members in the proletarianstate is that they should understand comradely disciplineand the necessity of uniting the workers’ forces for the pur -pose of protecting the interests of the working people, and that they should keep faith with the working people’s government, i. 
e. 
, the Soviet government. 
 The proletarianstate must encourage the workers to organise in trade unionsboth for legal and material reasons; but the trade unionscan have no rights without duties. 
 6. 
 THE TRADE UNIONS AND THE MANAGEMENT OF INDUSTRY Following its seizure of political power, the principal and fundamental interest of the proletariat lies in securing an increase in output, an enormous increase in the productive forces of society. 
 This task, which is clearly formulatedin the Programme of the Russian Communist Party, isparticularly urgent in our country today owing to post -war ruin, famine and economic dislocation. 
 Hence, the speediestand most enduring success in restoring large -scale industry is a condition without which no success can be achieved in the general cause of emancipating labour from the yokeof capital and securing the victory of socialism. 
 To achieve this success in Russia, in the conditions at present obtaining in that country, it is absolutely essential that all authority in the factories be concentrated in the hands of the manage -ment. 
 The factory management, usually built up on the principle of one -man responsibility, must have authority independently to fix and pay out wages, and also distributerations, working clothes, and all other supplies; it mustenjoy the utmost freedom to manoeuvre, exercise strict control of the actual successes achieved in increasing production, in making the factory pay its way and show a profit, andcarefully select the most talented and capable administrativepersonnel, etc. 
 Under these circumstances, any direct interference by the trade unions in the management of the factories must be regarded as positively harmful and impermissible. 
 It would be absolutely wrong, however, to interpret this indisputable axiom to mean that the trade unions mustplay no part in the socialist organisation of industry andin the management of state industry. 
 Their participationin this is necessary in the following strictly defined forms. 
 7. 
 THE ROLE AND FUNCTIONS OF THE TRADE UNIONS IN THE BUSINESS AND ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANISATIONS OF THE PROLETARIAN STATE The proletariat is the class foundation of the state making the transition from capitalism to socialism. 
 In a country wherethe small peasantry is overwhelmingly predominant theproletariat can successfully fulfil this function if it veryskilfully, cautiously and gradually establishes an alliance with the vast majority of the peasantry. 
 The trade unions must collaborate closely and constantly with the government,all the political and economic activities of which are guidedby the class -conscious vanguard of the working class—the Communist Party. 
 Being a school of communism in general,the trade unions must, in particular, be a school for training the whole mass of workers, and eventually all working people, in the art of managing socialist industry (andgradually also agriculture). 
 Proceeding from these principles, the trade unions’ part in the activities connected with the business and administra -tive organisations of the proletarian state should take thefollowing main forms: (1) The trade unions should help staff all the business and administrative bodies connected witheconomics by nominating their candidates for themand casting a consultative vote; the trade unions take part in these bodies too, not directly, but through the members of the higher state bodies, the members ofbusiness boards, members of the factory managements(where collegiate management is practised), managers,their assistants, etc. 
, nominated by them and endorsedby the Communist Party and the Soviet government. 
 (2) One of the most important functions of the trade unions is to promote and train factory managers fromamong the workers and the masses of the workingpeople generally. 
 At the present time we have scoresof such factory managers who are quite satisfactory, andhundreds who are more or less satisfactory, but very soon, however, we must have hundreds of the former and thousands of the latter. 
 The trade unions mustmuch more carefully and persistently than hithertokeep a systematic register of all workers and peasantscapable of holding posts of this kind, and thoroughly,efficiently and from every aspect verify the progress they make in learning the art of management. 
 (3) No less important is the participation of the trade unions in all the planning bodies of the proletarianstate. 
 In addition to participating in all cultural andeducational activities and in production propaganda, thetrade unions must also, on an increasing scale, enlist the working class and the masses of the working people generally for all branches of the work of building upthe state economy; they must make them familiarwith all aspects of economic life and with all detailsof industrial operations—from the procurement of rawmaterials to the marketing of the product; give them a more and more concrete understanding of the single state plan of socialist economy and the worker’s andpeasant’s practical interest in its implementation. 
 (4) The drawing up of wage rates and scales of sup -plies, etc. 
, is one of the essential functions of the trade unions in the building of socialism and in their partici -pation in the management of industry. 
 In particular, disciplinary courts should steadily improve labourdiscipline and proper ways of promoting it and achievingincreased productivity; but they must not interferewith the functions of the People’s Courts in general or with the functions of factory managements. 
 This list of the major functions of the trade unions in the work of building up socialist economy, should, of course, bedrawn up in greater detail by the competent trade unionand government bodies. 
 The most important thing is thatthe trade unions should consciously and resolutely avoid direct, inexpert, incompetent and irresponsible interference in administrative matters, which has caused no little harm,and should start persistent, practical activities calculatedto extend over a long period of years and designed to givethe workers and all the working people generally practical training in the art of managing the economy of the whole country. 
 8. 
 CONTACT WITH THE MASSES— THE FUNDAMENTAL CONDITION FOR ALL TRADE UNION ACTIVITY Contact with the masses, i. 
e. 
, with the overwhelming majority of the workers (and eventually of all the workingpeople), is the most important and most fundamentalcondition for the success of all trade union activity. 
 In allthe trade union organisations and their machinery, frombottom up, there should be instituted, and tested in practice over a period of many years, a system of responsible com -rades—who must not all be Communists—who should live right among the workers, study their lives in every detail,and be able unerringly, on any question, and at any time,to judge the mood, the real needs, aspirations, and thoughtsof the masses. 
 They must be able without a shadow of false idealisation to define the degree of their class -consciousness and the extent to which they are influenced by various pre -judices and survivals of the past; and they must be able to win the boundless confidence of the masses by a comradely attitude and concern for their needs. 
 One of the greatest and most serious dangers that confront the numerically small Communist Party, which, as the vanguard of theworking class, is guiding a vast country in the process oftransition to socialism (for the time being without thedirect support of the more advanced countries), is isolationfrom the masses, the danger that the vanguard may run too far ahead and fail to “straighten out the line”, fail to maintain firm contact with the whole army of labour,i. 
e. 
, with the overwhelming majority of workers and peas -ants. 
 Just as the very best factory, with the very bestmotors and first -class machines, will be forced to remain idle if the transmission -belts from the motors to the machines are damaged, so our work of socialist construction must meet with inevitable disaster if the trade unions—thetransmission belts from the Communist Party to the masses—are badly fitted or function badly. 
 It is not sufficient toexplain, to reiterate and corroborate this truth; it must bebacked up organisationally by the whole structure of the trade unions and by their everyday activities. 
 9. 
 THE CONTRADICTIONS IN THE STATUS OF THE TRADE UNIONS UNDER THE DICTATORSHIP OF THE PROLETARIAT From all the foregoing it is evident that there are a number of contradictions in the various functions of the trade unions. 
On the one hand, their principal method of operation is thatof persuasion and education; on the other hand, as partici -pants in the exercise of state power they cannot refuse to share in coercion. 
 On the one hand, their main function is to protect the interests of the masses of the working peoplein the most direct and immediate sense of the term; on theother hand, as participants in the exercise of state powerand builders of the economy as a whole they cannot refuseto resort to pressure. 
 On the one hand, they must operate in military fashion, for the dictatorship of the proletariat is the fiercest, most dogged and most desperate class war;on the other hand, specifically military methods of operation are least of all applicable to the trade unions. 
 On the one hand; they must be able to adapt themselves to the masses, to their level; on the other hand, they must never pander to the prejudices and backwardness of the masses, butsteadily raise them to a higher and higher level, etc. 
,etc. 
 These contradictions are no accident, and they will persist for several decades. 
 For one thing, these contradictions are inherent in every school. 
 And the trade unions are a school of communism. 
 We cannot count, until the lapse of severaldecades, on the majority of the workers achieving thehighest level of development and discarding all traces andmemories of the “school” for adults. 
 Secondly, as long assurvivals of capitalism and small production remain, contra -dictions between them and the young shoots of socialism areinevitable throughout the social system. 
 Two practical conclusions must be drawn from this. 
 First, for the successful conduct of trade union activitiesit is not enough to understand their functions correctly,it is not enough to organise them properly. 
 In addition, special tact is required, ability to approach the masses in a special way in each individual case for the purposeof raising these masses to a higher cultural, economic andpolitical stage with the minimum of friction. 
 Second, the aforementioned contradictions will inevitably give rise to disputes, disagreements, friction, etc. 
 A higher body is required with sufficient authority to settle these at once. 
 This higher body is the Communist Party and theinternational federation of the Communist Parties of allcountries—the Communist International. 
 10. 
 THE TRADE UNIONS AND THE SPECIALISTS The main principles on this question are set forth in the Programme of the Russian Communist Party; but thesewill remain paper principles unless constant attention ispaid to the facts which indicate the degree to which they are put into practice. 
 Recent facts of this kind are: first, cases of the murder of engineers by workers in socialisedmines not only in the Urals, but also in the Donets Basin; second, the suicide of V. 
 V. 
 Oldenborger, chief engineer of the Moscow Waterworks. 
 * The Communist Party and the Soviet government as a whole bear a far greater share of the blame for cases ofthis kind than the trade unions. 
 It is not a question nowof establishing the degree of political guilt, but of drawingcertain political conclusions. 
 Unless our leading bodies, i. 
e. 
,the Communist Party, the Soviet government and the trade unions, guard as the apple of their eye every specialist who does his work conscientiously and knows and loves it—eventhough the ideas of communism are totally alien to him—it will be useless to expect any serious progress in socialistconstruction. 
 We may not be able to achieve it soon, butwe must at all costs achieve a situation in which special -ists—as a separate social stratum, which will persist untilwe have reached the highest stage of development of commu -nist society—can enjoy better conditions of life undersocialism than they enjoyed under capitalism insofar asconcerns their material and legal status, comradely col -laboration with the workers and peasants, and in the intel -lectual plane, i. 
e. 
, finding satisfaction in their work, realisingthat it is socially useful and independent of the sordidinterests of the capitalist class. 
 Nobody will regard a govern -ment department as being tolerably well organised if itdoes not take systematic measures to provide for all theneeds of the specialists, to reward the best of them, to safeguard and protect their interests, etc. 
, and does not secure practical results in this. 
 The trade unions mustconduct all the activities of the type indicated (or system -atically collaborate in the activities of all the governmentdepartments concerned) not from the point of view of theinterests of the given department, but from the point of view of the interests of labour and of the economy as a whole. 
 With regard to the specialists, on the trade unions devolvesthe very arduous duty of daily exercising influence on thebroad masses of the working people in order to create properrelations between them and the specialists. 
 Only suchactivities can produce really important practical results.

 442 11. 
 THE TRADE UNIONS AND PETTY -BOURGEOIS INFLUENCES ON THE WORKING CLASS Trade unions are really effective only when they unite very broad strata of the non -Party workers. 
 This must give rise—particularly in a country in which the peasantrylargely predominates—to relative stability, specifically among the trade unions, of those political influences that serve as the superstructure over the remnants of capitalismand over small production. 
 These influences are petty -bourgeois, i. 
e. 
, Socialist -Revolutionary and Menshevik (the Russian variety of the parties of the II and II 2 Inter -nationals) on the one hand, and anarchist on the other. 
 Only among these trends has any considerable number of people remained who defend capitalism ideologically andnot from selfish class motives, and continue to believe inthe non -class nature of the “democracy”, “equality” and “liberty” in general that they preach. 
 It is to this socio -economic cause and not to the role of individual groups, still less of individual persons, that we must attribute the survivals (sometimes even the revival)in our country of such petty -bourgeois ideas among the trade unions. 
 The Communist Party, the Soviet bodiesthat conduct cultural and educational activities and allCommunist members of trade unions must therefore devote far more attention to the ideological struggle against petty -bourgeois influences, trends and deviations among the trade unions, especially because the New EconomicPolicy is bound to lead to a certain strengthening ofcapitalism. 
 It is urgently necessary to counteract this byintensifying the struggle against petty -bourgeois influences upon the working class. 
 The End Discuss together with the theses. 
 Give this to Comrade Molotov without rewriting . 
 This is the end of the publishable theses; i. 
e. 
, the draft of them that is being submitted to the commission andthen the Politbureau. 
 I suggest that the resolution contained in Comrade Rudzutak’s draft be adopted by a special decision of the Politbureau in the following wording: The Politbureau directs the Orgbureau to set upunder the Orgbureau of the Central Committeea special commission to check and replace someof the leading officials (and if possible all com -munist functionaries) in the trade union move -ment for the purpose of intensifying the struggleagainst petty -bourgeois, S.

 (Some to be expelled from the Party for good or for a time, some to be severely reprimanded, depending on the measure of their guilt.

 Besides films, photographs of propaganda interest should be shown with appropriate subtitles. 
 The privately ownedcinemas should be made to yield a sufficient return to thestate in the form of rent, the owners to be allowed to increasethe number of films and present new ones subject to censor -ship by the Commissariat for Education and provided the proper proportion is maintained between entertainment films and propaganda films coming under the heading offilms “From the life of peoples of all countries”, in orderthat film -makers should have an incentive for producing new pictures. 
 They should be allowed wide initiative withinthese limits. 
 Pictures of a propaganda and educative nature should be checked by old Marxists and writers, to avoid a repetition of the many sad instances when propaganda with us defeated its own purpose. 
 Special attention should be given to organising film showings in the villages and in the East, where they are novelties and where our propaganda, therefore, will be all the more effective .

II. 
1922 To Comrade Molotov for members of the Politbureau I propose that the following directives to the deputy chairman and all members of the Genoa delegation be endorsed: 1. 
 All members of the delegation should be posted in a general way on all political and financial questions that are likely to be brought up at the conference. 
 Moreover,every member of the delegation should make a special andthorough study of one of the most important diplomatic and one of the most important financial questions. 
 Chicherin and Litvinov are to be charged with drawing up an assignment of these questions among all the members of the delegation (with the exception of sick members like Rudzutak, etc. 
). 
 2. 
 Every member of the delegation must prepare for the meeting on 22. 
II (with the Politbureau of the C. 
C. 
) thebriefest (maximum 2 -3 pages telegraphic style) of summaries of his programme of views and policies on all cardinalquestions, both diplomatic and financial. 
 3. 
 Chicherin and Litvinov are to see to it that the appropriate literature in different languages is collected and handed out to the members of the delegation togetherwith a systematic collection of documents in the Russianlanguage. 
 4. 
 In view of the special importance and special diffi -culty of financial questions, Chicherin and Litvinov, by arrangement with the People’s Commissariat for Finance, the State Planning Commission and A. 
 D. 
 Tsyurupa,are to draw up a list of financial experts and a planof work distribution among them; this to be done within1 week. 
 5. 
 All members of the delegation must be perfectly familiar with Keynes’s book ( The Economic Consequences of the Peace ) and with similar bourgeois and bourgeois -pacifist books and parts of books (Lansing on the “imperialist” nature of the war and the peace of 1918, and so on). 
 Preparationsshould be on these lines: speeches and statements shouldgive the communist point of view in a nutshell, set forth in such a way as to intimate that although we are Communists and hold such -and-such communist views we wish to cite non-Communists to this audience and to pose the question of annulling all debts and so forth from the bourgeoisstandpoint (see 6 and 7). 
 6. 
 All speeches and statements by our delegates at the conference should be calculated in advance in such a way that whatever the course or the outcome of theconference (even in the event of its speedy failure, whichwe, of course, should try to prevent), there would be, asa result, a brief but clear statement of the sum total ofcommunist views (on questions of international relations and economics) and a detailed statement of bourgeois and bourgeois pacifist views on the irreconcilable contradictionsof the imperialist world (and the imperialist peace). 
 7. 
 It is highly probable, almost certain, that all the bourgeois delegates at the conference will immediately form a silent but strong bloc for attacking us on account of Georgia and with all the usual accusations of petty -bourgeois and big bourgeois diplomacy and democracy. 
We should be prepared for this in advance and make sure thatwe are the first to attack (apart from our main object ofdividing the different countries and setting them by the ears). 
 The initiative in taking the offensive should be done mostly in a veiled form, for example by “hinting” (or bybourgeois quotations from relevant works) at the mostpainful and shameful points of imperialist relations (Korea;Amritsar; public flogging of revolutionaries in India;Lloyd George’s speech against Briand at Cannes concerning “assassinations” and so on and so forth). 
 8. 
 In view of the repeatedly proven desire on the part of our specialists in general and the Menshevik -minded ones in particular to fool us (very often successfully)by turning their foreign trips into a holiday and a means ofstrengthening whiteguard ties, the Central Committee proposes to limit ourselves in this case to an absolute minimum of fully reliable experts, each of whom is topresent a guarantee in writing from the People’s Commissarconcerned and from several Communists. 
 Forty -five is the top limit. 
 The list of experts and of all members to be sub -mitted for approval to the C. 
C. 
 within 1 2 weeks. 
 This § to be taken charge of by Comrades Litvinov, Joffe and Chicherin. 
 They are also to choose a business manager whowill not permit night work and such -like scandalous practices. 
 I move the following addendum to the draft theses of directives for the Genoa delegation: 9. 
 Our delegates should cite §1 of the Cannes terms in their speeches and statements as often as possible, this citing to be done, first, exclusively in the wording ofPetit Parisien , i. 
e. 
, using the words “system of property” and not just “system”; secondly, these words and this § tobe given an extended meaning as if implying recognitionof the inevitability of the capitalist system of property being replaced by the communist system of property, as if the only point at issue “between us” now remains thequestion of when this replacement will be effected and in what manner, i. 
e. 
, by the Russian method of 1917 -20 or by the Lloyd George method of “truncated revolution” of the 1921 Irish type or the 1922 Egyptian type.

 ZINOVIEV To Comrades Bukharin and Zinoviev We must consider beforehand what people, preferably those with a ready tongue, are going to represent the Comin -tern at the conference with the II and II 2 Internationals. 
451 We must also consider beforehand the basic questions oftactics and strategy to be employed at this meeting. 
 The list of questions to be dealt with at the meeting. 
 should be considered beforehand and drawn up in agreement with each of the parties attending the meeting. 
 On ourpart we should include in this list only questions thathave a direct bearing on practical joint action by theworking masses and touching on matters that are recognisedas indisputable in the official press statement of each of the three participants. 
 We must explain at length the reasons why we confine ourselves to such questions in theinterests of a united front. 
 In the event of the yellow -fraternity raising mooted questions of policy, such as ourattitude to the Mensheviks, the question of Georgia, etc. 
,we should adopt these tactics: 1) declare that the list of questions can be drawn up only by a unanimous decision of all three participants; 2) declare that in drawing up ourlist of questions we were guided exclusively by the desirefor unity of action by the working masses, which unitycould be achieved immediately even under existing deep -seated political differences; 3) declare that we fully agree to questions such as our attitude to the Mensheviks, the question of Georgia and any other questions being raisedby the II and II 2 Internationals, provided that they agree to the following questions being raised: 1) the renegade attitude of the II and II 2 Internationals to the Basle Manifesto; 2) complicity of these same parties in the murder of Luxemburg, Liebknecht and other Communists ofGermany through the bourgeois governments which thoseparties support; 3) a similar attitude of these parties tothe murder of revolutionaries in the colonies by the bourgeoisparties which the II and II 2 Internationals support, etc. 
, etc. 
 We should prepare a list of these and similar questions beforehand and also prepare beforehand theses and speakerson various important questions of this nature. 
 We must find occasion to declare officially that we regard the II and II 2 Internationals only as inconsistent and vacillating participants of a bloc with the counter -revolutionary world bourgeoisie, and that we agree toattend a meeting on the united front for the sake ofachieving possible practical unity of direct action on thepart of the masses and in order to expose the political errorof the II and II 2 Internationals’ entire position, just as the latter (the II and II 2 Internationals) have agreed to attend a meeting with us for the sake of achieving practical unity of direct action by the masses and in orderto expose the political error of our position.

 Those articles (or such parts of them) which contain no confidential matter should immediately be published in our press.

(B. 
) FOR THE SOVIE T DELEGATION TO THE GENO A CONFERENC E454 I propose the following draft of C. 
C. 
 directives: Without endorsing the list of experts, the C. 
C. 
 directs the candidates nominated in it to submit within a week a précis of programme and tactics (on questions that come within the terms of reference of the given expert) for the whole Genoa Conference. 
 All People’s Commissars are obliged within 2 days to give written testimonials and guarantees for their candidates nominated as experts. 
Should the experts disgrace themselves in Europe they andthe People’s Commissars will be held responsible. 
 In furtherance of the directives concerning the Genoa Conference I propose the following : 1. 
 Without pre -determining in what form and at what time the speeches of our delegation should be made, the C. 
C. 
considers that the delegation is definitely obliged to developa full, independent and integral programme on all cardinal issues. 
 2. 
 This programme should be a bourgeois -pacifist pro -gramme with the reservation, timely and clearly expressed by our delegation, that we do not put forward here a commu -nist programme—the only one that is in keeping with our views—(set it forth briefly) because we wish to put before the other delegations, who hold fundamentally differentviews, a number of palliatives and measures of a reformisttype which have already been proposed in parts in Britainand other capitalist countries by people who share bourgeoisviews. 
 Under certain conditions this programme of pallia -tives could serve to mitigate the present difficult situation(the only real way out of which is possible given a finalbreak with all the principles of capitalist property). 
 3. 
 A tentative list of the main points of this programme: (1) annulment of all debts; (2) application of the “Irish” solution to all colonies and dependent countries and nations; (3) radical revision of the Versailles Treaty;(4) the granting of loans on favourable terms to the countries most ruined by the war and too weak torecover their own feet, while being most importantfor world economy as eventual suppliers of vast quantities of food and raw materials; (5) establishment of a unified international gold unit for the currency systems of a number of countriesand measures to introduce this unit; (6) an agreement among a number of countries on measures to combat inflation and depreciation of money (enumerate some of these measures); (7) agreement among a number of countries on measures for coping with the fuel crisis and on measuresfor the most rational and economical use of powerresources on the basis of unified planned electrification; (8) the same in regard to the most urgent measures for reorganising and improving international transport to handle deliveries of raw materials and food. 
 And so on. 
 4. 
 Such a programme should be elaborated in speeches, and if this is impossible, printed in 3 -4 European languages and handed out to the delegates and the press (if only in the form of a précis). 
 (In any case it should be printed. 
) 5. 
 Only such people should be admitted as experts who are capable of developing, and making out a case for such a programme (in one or another part of it) and who have proved this capability . 
 The experts will have to have their programmes and plans printed for Europe over their own signatures . 
 ((Such a programme will evoke comment in the press of the Third International, whose articles will say:this attempt “to convince” will do no harm, but practicallyit is useless, because what is needed is a revolution ; and in the press of the II and II 2 Internationals—we shall see what they have to say.

(B. 
) WITH REMARK S TO THE DRAF T RESOLUTION FOR THE FIRS T EXTENDE D PLENAR Y MEETING OF THE COMINTER N EXECUTIVE ON PARTICIPATIO N IN A CONFERENCE OF THE THRE E INTERNATIONAL S456 To Comrade Molotov (for members of the Politbureau) I move the following amendments to the draft resolution sent in by Zinoviev concerning the Comintern’s participa -tion in the planned conference of all the workers’ parties of the world. 
 After the words: “unity of action among theworking class masses which could be achieved immediately,despite fundamental political differences,” the phrasesfollowing this should be deleted up to the words: “that the working -class masses demand unity of action”. 
 The phrase beginning with these last words should be recast as follows: “the class -conscious workers, who are perfectly well aware of these political differences, nevertheless, together withthe vast majority of the workers, desire and demand unityof action on practical issues most urgent and close to the interests of the workers. 
 There can be no doubt about this now in the mind of any conscientious person” and so on. 
 My second amendment is that the phrase beginning with the words: “all controversial issues to be avoided andquestions that are not open to argument to be brought intofocus” should be amended as follows: “and while postponing for a time the more controversial questions and bringing into focus the less controversial, both sides, or rather allthree international organisations taking part in theconference, will naturally count on the ultimate victory oftheir points of view. 
” My chief amendment is aimed at deleting the passage which calls the leaders of the II and II 2 Internationals accomplices of the world bourgeoisie. 
 You might as wellcall a man a “jackass”. 
 It is absolutely unreasonable to risk wrecking an affair of tremendous practical importance for the sake of giving oneself the extra pleasure of scolding scoundrels, whom we shall be scolding a thousand times at another place and time. 
 If there are still people at theenlarged meeting of the Executive who have not grasped thefact that the tactic of the united front will help us tooverthrow the leaders of the II and II 2 Internationals, these people should have an extra number of popular lectures and talks read to them. 
 It may be necessary to have a special -ly popular pamphlet written for them and published in French, say, if the Frenchmen have not yet grasped Marxisttactics. 
 Finally, it were better to adopt this resolution,not unanimously, but by a majority (those who voted againstwe would afterwards put through a special, thorough and popular course of enlightenment) than run the risk of spoil -ing a practical affair for the sake of a few political youngsters who tomorrow will be cured of their infantile disorder.

, R. 
C. 
P. 
 (B. 
) ON THE TASKS OF THE SOVIET DELEGATION AT GENOA Only for circulation among members of the Politbureau Draft decision for the C. 
C. 
 1. 
 The C. 
C. 
 recognises as correct the appraisal of the situation and the tasks (of our delegation at Genoa) asgiven in the theses of Comrade Litvinov. 
 2. 
 The C. 
C. 
 fully empowers Vice Chairman Chicherin to act as chairman of the delegation. 
 3. 
 In the event of Comrade Chicherin’s illness or departure his powers shall be vested in turn in one of the two trios: a) Litvinov, Krasin, Rakovsky; b) Litvinov, Joffe, Vorovsky. 
 4. 
 Our delegation should try to evade the question of acceptance of the Cannes terms. 
 Failing this, and in theevent of our being presented with a direct ultimatum, weshould try to work Krasin’s formula: “All countries recognisetheir state debts and undertake to compensate damage andlosses caused by the acts of their governments. 
” If this does not work either, we should make for a break, declaring definitely that we are prepared to recogniseprivate debts, but that, not wishing to play hide -and-seek, we point out that we consider them covered, together withthe whole sum of our obligations, by our counter -claims. 
 We accept no chief umpire between us and all the bourgeois countries, since the dispute is between two systems of property. 
 If we have to break, we should make it perfectly clear that the main and sole reason for the break is the greed ofa handful of private capitalists, Urquhart, etc. 
, whom thegovernments serve. 
 As a maximum concession these capitalists can be offered: a preferential right to concessions (i. 
e. 
, if we grant Xa concession on their former property wholly or in part onsuch -and-such terms, we undertake to give it to its former owner on the same terms). 
 5. 
 In view of the possibility of the bourgeois trying to prevent us from developing our programme, we should make every effort in the very first speech to set forth, if notdevelop, this programme, or at least outline it (andimmediately publish it in greater detail). 
 6. 
 In our programme we should, without concealing our communist views, confine ourselves to a brief and passing mention of them (for instance, in a subordinate clause), and to a forthright statement to the effect that wedo not consider this the right place to preach our views,since we have come for trade agreements and for an attemptto reach an agreement with the pacifist section of the other(bourgeois) camp. 
 By the pacifist section of that camp (or some other well -chosen polite expression) we should make it clear that we mean the petty -bourgeois, pacifist and semi -pacifist democrats of the II and II 2 International type, and the Keynes type, etc. 
 One of our main, if not principal, political tasks at Genoa is to single out this wing of the bourgeois camp from therest of the camp, try to flatter that wing, make it knownthat we consider possible and desirable not only a trade,but a political agreement with them (as one of the fewchances of capitalism’s peaceful evolution towards the new order, which we, Communists, do not greatly believe in, but which we agree and consider our duty to help try out,as representatives of one power in face of a hostile majorityof other powers). 
 Everything possible and even impossible should be done to strengthen the pacifist wing of the bourgeoisie and increase if only slightly its chances of success at the elections. 
 This first and foremost. 
 Secondly, to disunite the bourgeoiscountries that will be united against us at Genoa—suchis our dual political task at Genoa, and not at all thedevelopment of communist views.

 Every attempt should be made to develop at length and publicise as widely as possible (in print, if not in speeches) the plan for the rehabilitation of the nationaleconomy in Russia and in Europe—in the spirit of the StatePlanning Commission’s researches and on the basis of theseresearches. 
 8. 
 If the bourgeois camp in Genoa presents an ultimatum to us not to touch on questions of pacifism, but to speak only on narrow trade subjects, we should express our regret,but comply with this ultimatum, saying that we had twoaims at this conference—a pacifist aim and a trade aim. 
This will leave only one.

 On the question of trade and concessions (including the question of loans), the forests of the North, etc.

 This is done “by mistake”. 
 The danger of this “mistake”, however, is enormous. 
 I move : 1. 
 That Comrade Divilkovsky’s proposal be adopted . 
 2. 
 That the Moscow Committee be severely reprimanded for being indulgent to Communists (the form of indulgence —a special commission). 
 3. 
 That it be confirmed to all Gubernia Party Committees that for the slightest attempt to “influence” the courts in the sense of “mitigating” the responsibility of Communists, the C.

 That a circular be issued notifying the People’s Commissariat for Justice (copies to the Gubernia PartyCommittees) to the effect that the courts are obliged topunish Communists more severely than non -Communists. 
 People’s judges and members of the Board of the Commissariat for Justice who fail to observe this are to bedismissed from office.

 GORBUNOV AND PROPOSAL S ON THE QUESTION OF THE CO-OPERATIVE S464 Comrade Gorbunov, Read this, make a note of it for yourself and forward it immediately to Comrade Molotov for the members of the Politbureau , then for Tsyurupa and Rykov . 
 In my opinion, the co -operatives are not the trade unions. 
 The co -operatives should remain obligatory as regards membership. 
 Contributions should be voluntary. 
 If our co -operatives will carry on trade (and not play at publishing dailies in which idle chatter -mongers engage in political twaddle, which everyone is fed up with), then trading should yieldan income. 
 Those who make contributions will receive anincome. 
 Everybody should be a member of the co -operatives. 
 We need this for the future. 
 I don’t see how this interfereswith anything. 
 Shares are voluntary. 
 Those who have paid their contrib -utions should receive a share of the profit. 
 Conclusion: I think the matter should be postponed; it should not be raised at this session.

466 2) On the same page, lines 8 and 9 up—all mention of “inevitable forcible revolution and the use of sanguinarystruggle” must definitely be thrown out; instead we shouldspeak only of the fact that we Communists do not share the views of the pacifists—a fact which is sufficiently well known from communist literature—but having come here asmerchants, we positively consider it our duty to give ourfullest support to any attempts at a peaceful settlementof outstanding problems. 
 3) On the same page, 2nd and 3rd lines up—the words stating that our “historic conception includes the use offorcible measures” should definitely be deleted. 
 4) Page 2, 2nd and 3rd lines down—the words about our historic conception being definitely based on the inevitabil -ity of new world wars should be definitely deleted. 
 Under no circumstance should such frightful words be used, as this would mean playing into the hands of ouropponents. 
 We should confine ourselves only to mentioningthat the views of the Communists do not coincide with theviews of such pacifists as the states we are beginningnegotiations with, such statesmen as Henderson, Keynes,etc. 
, but that we consider it our duty, in order to achieve the economic agreement we are desirous of concluding, to do everything in our power for the broadest possible fulfilmentof at least a certain part of this pacifist programme.

 When the majority of the workers have already established their class, i. 
e. 
, their Soviet, and not “general national” (i. 
e. 
, in common with the bourgeoisie) representation, and have overthrown the political domination of the bourgeoisie, then the tactics of the united front, of course, cannot require co-operation with parties such as that of the Mensheviks (the “R.

R.

 2 2 SPEEC H ON THE QUESTION OF PRINTIN G ADVERTISEMENT S IN PRAVDA APRI L 2469 Comrades, an almost fatal mistake has occurred here. 
 I have risen to a point of order (as the chairman made clear) and not to make a closing speech. 
 I have taken thefloor to ask the congress to waive standing orders and procedure. 
 There is a rule that after a decision has been passed there can be no interference on that question. 
 I ask the congress to give me 4 or 5 minutes in order to oppose the decision that has been wrongly passed here. 
 When I heard that the congress had passed this decision and when I heard that Comrade Ryazanov had defended it ...(Ryazanov : “That is not so. 
”) All the better—at least one absurd decision has by -passed Ryazanov. 
 If we were dealing here with an innocent young lady of some twelve summers, who had learned only yesterday that there was such a thingin the world as communism, and she would have put ona frilly white frock with red ribbons and said that Commu -nists were just pure tradesmen—that would be funny,and we could enjoy a hearty laugh over it, but seriously, what are we doing? Where will Pravda get the money to make up for the advertisements we have deprived it of?I ask—how much money does Pravda need to keep up with Izvestia ? You don’t know? Nor do I!

 2. 
 That directives be given to the Soviet and Party press to appraise the Berlin agreement from this angle, and to dwell at special length on the factual existing links between the S.

 3. 
 That the publication for the said purpose in all European languages of Savinkov’s pamphlet Fighting the Bolsheviks a nd of S. 
 Ivanovich’s pamphlet The Twilight of Russian Social -Democracy should be speeded up and a detailed account given of how these pamphlets prove thereal ties that exist between the Right -wing Mensheviks and S. 
R. 
s and international reaction. 
 4. 
 That Comrade Trotsky be directed to see to it that these and similar materials are published in all languages with appropriate comments as quickly as possible. 
 5. 
 That Comrade Radek be asked by wire to return to Moscow as soon as possible with the full minutes of theBerlin Conference. 
 6. 
 That Comrade Bukharin shall be forbidden to return to Russia until he has completed his cure.

 45 REMARK S AND PROPOSALS TO THE DRAF T DECISION FOR THE COMINTER N EXECUTIV E FOLLOWING THE CONFERENCE OF THE THRE E INTERNATIONAL S472 LETTERS TO G. 
 Y. 
 ZINOVIEV 1 On Point 1 I propose the addendum: dwell at greater length 1) on the real links between our Mensheviks and S. 
R. 
s and the common front of the landowners and bourgeoisie against the Soviet government, special attention being given for this purpose to Savinkov’s pamphlet Fighting the Bolsheviks (Warsaw, 1920) and S. 
 Ivanovich’s pamphlet The Twilight of Russian Social -Democracy , as these booklets very clearly reveal what is known, of course, from a numberof other documents—namely, that Right -wing Mensheviks and S. 
R. 
s take refuge behind the name of a common party,as a matter of form, while in fact they act quite independ -ently; 2) pay special attention to showing up the identityof our Mensheviks and S. 
R. 
s with the leaders of the II andII 2 Internationals, the highly pernicious nature of Otto Bauer’s recent pamphlet, which virtually proposes and preaches panic retreat in the face of capitalism. 
 Such preaching we regard as tantamount to preaching panicflight at the front during war. 
 Point 2, I accept. 
Re Point 3:I have my doubts about this, as I believe that a precisely worded ruling calling for unanimity should save us frommaking mistakes, while general appeals on subjects clarify -ing the points endorsed at the Berlin Conference (defenceof Soviet Russia, etc. 
) will be extremely useful to us, as we shall repeatedly make use of them in future to expose the muddle our opponents have got themselves into. 
 Re Point 4—I definitely support this. 
Re Point 5—I have no objection. 
Re Point 6: The purport of this point is not clear to me. 
 I believe that the Berlin agreement should be ratified immediately upon receipt of the official text of the adopted decisions, or, better still perhaps, it should be ratified at once withthe reservation that the text being ratified was the one thatwas published in Pravda on 9/IV. 
 I would particularly ask you to arrange for the full text of the minutes of the Berlin Conference to be dispatched as quickly as possible by special courier and to check whether these minutes have been signed by the official representativesof each of the three Internationals. 
 Lenin Dictated over the telephone April 11, 1922 First published in 1959 Printed from the secretary’s in Lenin Miscellany XXXVI notes (typew ritten copy) 2 Comrade Zinoviev, The following should be added to those points of the Comintern Executive’s decision on which we exchanged notes this morning: Criticism of the policy of the II and II 2 Internationals should now be given a somewhat different character, namely,this criticism (especially at meetings attended by workerswho support the II and II 2 Internationals, and in special leaflets and articles written for them) should tend to be of a clarifying nature, made with particular patience andthoroughness, so as not to scare away these workers withharsh words, and bring home to them the irreconcilablecontradictions between the slogans their representativeshave adopted in Berlin (for example, the fight against capital, the eight -hour day, defence of Soviet Russia, aid to the famine -stricken) and the entire reformist policy. 
 Perhaps, before publishing this, we ought to verify whether the Berlin decisions have been ratified by the II andII 2 Internationals. 
 Lenin Dictated over the telephone April 11, 1922 First published in 1959 Printed from the secretary’s in Lenin Miscellany XXXVI notes (typew ritten copy) INTERVIE W WITH THE CORRESPONDENT OF THE NE W YOR K HERAL D473 In his talk with the correspondent of the American newspaper The New York Herald on the subject of the Genoa Conference, Lenin stated: This Conference should be guided only by one economic principle. 
 Russia is well aware of what she can expect from the bourgeois states. 
 The present state of affairs cannotcontinue any longer. 
 It is disastrous both for Russia andfor the whole world. 
 Russia stands in need of trade with the bourgeois states. 
 On the other hand, the bourgeois governments are well aware that the economic life of Europe cannot be adjusted without Russia. 
 However, those who intend to offer humiliating terms to the Russian delegation at Genoa are deeply mistaken. 
Russia will not allow herself to be treated as a vanquishedcountry. 
 If the bourgeois governments try to adopt such a tone towards Russia they will be committing the greatest folly.

” I hope the purport of this concession is clear: we consider ourselves, the Ukrainian S. 
S. 
R. 
 and others, equal, and enter with them, on an equal basis, into a new union, a new federation, the Union of the Soviet Republics of Europe and Asia. 
 Clause 2 needs to be amended as well. 
 What is needed besides the sessions of the All -Russia Central Executive Committee of the R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
 is a “Federal All -Union Central Executive Committee of the Union of the Soviet Republics of Europe and Asia. 
” If the former should hold sessions once a week, and the latter once a week (or once a fortnight even), this may be easily arranged. 
 The important thing is not to provide material for the “pro-independence” people, not to destroy their independence , but to create another new storey , a federation of equal republics. 
 The second part of Clause 2 could stand: the dissatisfied will appeal (against decisions of the Council of Labour and Defence , and the Council of People’s Commissars ) to the Federal All-Union Central Executive Committee, without thereby suspending implementation (just as in the R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
). 
 Clause 3 could stand, but its wording should be: “amalgam -ate in federal People’s Commissariats whose seat shall be in Moscow, with the proviso that the respective People’sCommissariats of the R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
 have their authorisedrepresentatives with a small staff in all the Republicsthat have joined the Union of Republics of Europe and Asia . 
” Part 2 of Clause 3 remains; perhaps it could be said to emphasise equality: “by agreement of the Central Executive Committees of the member republics of the Union of the Soviet Republics of Europe and Asia. 
” Let’s think about Part 3: perhaps we had better substitute “mandatory ” for “desirable”? Or perhaps insert conditionally mandatory at least in the form of a request for instructions and the authority to decide without such instructions solely in cases of “specially urgent importance”? Clause 4 could perhaps also be “amalgamate by agreement of the Central Executive Committees”? Perhaps add to Clause 5: “with the establishment of joint (or general) conferences and congresses of a purely consultative nature (or perhaps of a solely consultative nature)? Appropriate alterations in the 1st and 2nd comments.

 45 TO THE RUSSIA N COLONY IN NORT H AMERIC A487 Comrade Reichel, a representative of the American Society for Technical Aid for Soviet Russia, told me about the incorrect view on the New Economic Policy prevalent /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR among some members of the Russian colony in North America. 
 This incorrect view could, I believe, be the result of deliberate misinterpretation of this policy by the capitalistpress and the ridiculous tales spread by the embitteredwhiteguards, who have been driven out of Soviet Russia,as well as by the Mensheviks and Socialist -Revolutionaries. 
 In Europe these tales about us and especially about our New Economic Policy are falling into disuse. 
 The New Economic Policy has changed nothing radically in the socialsystem of Soviet Russia, nor can it change anything so longas the power is in the hands of the workers—and that Sovietpower has come to stay, no one now, I think, can have anydoubt. 
 The malignity of the capitalist press and the influx of Russian whiteguards in America merely prove our strength. 
 The state capitalism, which is one of the principal aspects of the New Economic Policy, is, under Soviet power, a formof capitalism that is deliberately permitted and restrictedby the working class. 
 Our state capitalism differsessentially from the state capitalism in countries that have bourgeois governments in that the state with us is repre -sented not by the bourgeoisie, but by the proletariat, who has succeeded in winning the full confidence of the peasantry. 
 Unfortunately, the introduction of state capitalism with us is not proceeding as quickly as we would like it. 
 Forexample, so far we have not had a single important conces -sion, and without foreign capital to help develop oureconomy, the latter’s quick rehabilitation is inconceivable. 
 Those to whom the question of our New Economic Policy—the only correct policy—is not quite clear, I wouldrefer to the speeches of Comrade Trotsky and my ownspeech at the Fourth Congress of the Communist International * devoted to this question. 
 Comrade Reichel has told me about the preparatory work which the Society for Technical Aid is doing to organiseAmerican agricultural and other producers’ communeswho wish to come out to work in Russia and intend to bringwith them new instruments of production, tractors, seeds of improved cultures, and so on.

 I have already expressed my gratitude to the American comrades in my letters to the Society for Technical Aid and the Society of Friends of Soviet Russia in connection with the very successful work of their agricultural communes and units in Russia in the summer of 1922 . 
* I take this opportunity to thank you once more on behalf of the Soviet Government and to stress the fact that of all the forms of aid the aid to our agriculture and improv e-ment of its technical methods is the most important and valuable for us.

 3. 
The necessity of fighting for transition demands subject to appropriate reservations making these demands dependent on concrete conditions of place and time should be stated explicitly and categorically in the national programmes. 
 4. 
The theoretical basis for all such transition or limited demands should be definitely stated in the general pro-gramme, the Fourth Congress declaring that the Comintern emphatically condemns both the attempts to represent the inclusion of limited demands in the programme as opportunism, and all and any attempts to use limited demands to obscure and side-track the basic revolutionary task. 
 5. 
The general programme should clearly state the basic historical types of transition demands of the national parties depending on cardinal differences of economic structure, as for example, Britain and India, and such -like.

 4. 
 All the above -mentioned work is distributed among the deputies in such a way that each of the three (and ifneed be their assistants from among the business managers)handles a definite job for two months and afterwards changes it for another. 
 This is necessary in order that all the deputies may acquaint themselves with the entire apparatus and in order to achieve real unity of management. 
) 5. 
 The draft of such a distribution among the three deputies is to be drawn up by them immediately andapproved by all four. 
 6. 
 Since the work of improving and correcting the whole apparatus is far more important than the work of chairman -ship and the chatting with Deputy People’s Commissars and People’s Commissars, which has up till now fully occupied all the deputies’ time, it is necessary to arrange and strictly carry out a practice under which each deputy, for not less than two hours a week, “goes down to the bottom”, makes a personal study of all the various parts of the apparatustop and bottom, and the most unexpected ones at that. 
The official record of such a study, made, confirmed andcommunicated (in certain cases) to all government depart -ments, should lead to a reduction in staff and tighten up discipline throughout our state machinery.

 Comrades Kamenev, Rykov and Tsyurupa Owing to a recurrence of my illness I must wind up all political work and take a holiday again. 
492 Therefore our disagreements with you lose their practical significance. 
I must say, however, that I utterly disagree with Rykov’spractical addendum, and I move the exact opposite againstit—namely, that reception should be quite free, unlimited and even extended. 
 493 I am leaving the details until a personal meeting. 
 To a considerable extent I disagree also with the distribution of the commissariats. 
 I think this distributionshould be more closely adjusted to the ability for purelyadministrative work on the part of the various deputies; in my opinion, the chief fault of your yesterday’s distribution consists in the lack of such adjustment. 
 494 The functions of chairmanship and supervision of the proper legal wording of both legislative acts and decisions of the Financial Committee and so forth should be far more strictly separated from the functions of checking and improving the admini -strative apparatus. 
 Comrade Kamenev is more suitable for the former functions (i. 
e. 
, chairmanship, supervision ofproper wording, etc. 
) whereas the purely administrativefunctions are more in Tsyurupa’s and Rykov’s line. 
 For the general reason mentioned above I must defer this question until my return from leave. 
 But please bear in mind that I give my consent to your proposed distribution,not for three months (as you suggest), but pending myreturn to work, should this take place earlier than withinthree months. 
 I see that your distribution has overlooked such an important organ as Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn , which needs someone to keep a special eye on it. 
 I think this couldbest be done by Rykov.

 Dictated not later than January 9, 1923 First published in 1959 Printed from the secretary’s in Lenin Miscellany XXXVI notes (typew ritten copy) 2 WHAT SHOULD WE DO WITH THE W. 
P. 
I. 
? Without a doubt, the W. 
P. 
I. 
 is an enormous difficulty for us. 
 So far nothing has come of it, and the question ofits organisation and even its expediency remains a question. 
 I think that those who doubt whether there is any need for it are wrong. 
 At the same time, however, I do not deny that the problem presented by our state machinery and the task of improving it is very difficult and far from beingsolved. 
 With the exception of the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, our state apparatus is largely a survivalof the past, and least of all affected by any drastic change. 
 It has only been slightly touched up on the surface. 
 In all other respects, in order to get it to work properly, it hasalways been necessary for the workers’ and peasants’ state—astate built entirely on new lines—to concentrate mem -bers of the Party in it throughout the hierarchicalframework. 
 It is worth remembering how we acted in the critical moments of the civil war, how we concentrated our bestParty forces in the Red Army, how we resorted to themobilisation of the advanced workers from among the Partyranks—in order to confirm what has been said. 
 And so, I believe, as a result of all our attempts to reorganise the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection there emerges the conclusion that we have not made one moreattempt. 
 Namely, we have not tried to put this matter intothe hands of our workers and peasants, by placing them atthe head of our Party as members of the Central Committee. 
 I visualise this reform of the W. 
P. 
I. 
 in the following manner: some 50 to 75 workers and peasants, fully tried and trusted as to conscientiousness and devotion, are electedto the C. 
C. 
 of the Party in addition to the other C. 
C. 
members. 
 At the same time, the staff of the W. 
P. 
I. 
 shouldbe reduced at last (at long last!) to several hundred, con -sisting, on the one hand, of persons with most experience in W. 
P. 
I. 
 work in general, i. 
e. 
, persons who are most familiar with the general supervision of our apparatus ofhighly skilled specialists and who have a knowledge of both our apparatus and of the principles and problems of office work organisation, methods of verification and investigation—and, on the other hand, of persons of the purely secretarial, auxiliary staff. 
 The task of the new members of the C. 
C, who have fully equal rights with the other members of the C. 
C. 
, is, bylong hard work, to make a study of and improve our statemachinery. 
 All the other members of the W. 
P. 
I. 
 staff are to help them in this, some as persons most familiar with this machinery and with the work of the W. 
P. 
I. 
, othersas employees of the secretarial type. 
 At the same time the People’s Commissariat of Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection could remain the same commis -sariat it has been up till now. 
 The new members of the C. 
C. 
 could be considered temporarily attached to it. 
 The People’s Commissar of the W. 
P. 
I. 
 could retain his presentrank, position and rights along with the members of hisBoard. 
 What do we stand to gain from such an organisation? First of all, we would drop once and for all the practice of new reorganisations undertaken on the basis of an inadequate study of our apparatus. 
 Secondly, we wouldenhance the authority of this commissariat both by meansof enlisting members of the C. 
C. 
 to it and by reducingits staff to a few hundred members. 
 From the presentposition, under which the members of the People’s Commis -sariat of the W. 
P. 
I. 
 as a general rule live on sops from theinspected institutions, we would pass immediately toa position under which the maximum independence of theW. 
P. 
I. 
 employees would be guaranteed either by a veryhigh salary (this could be achieved by reducing the numberof the staff to a few hundred very highly skilled and tested top -level workers), or by those assistants of a purely secretarial type, who would be under the constant controland supervision of both the above -mentioned members of the C. 
C. 
 and of the few specialists left by us after carefulscreening of the commissariat’s staff The new members of the Central Committee would be assigned the task of making a closer and more careful study of our machinery of state in all its ramifications, including,incidentally, the state trusts. 
 This job cannot be done quickly. 
 No definite time limit, therefore, would be set for them. 
 On the other hand, they could reckon on several years work by alternating members of the C. 
C. 
 working on the same assignment, i. 
e. 
, by adecision of a Party congress we would guarantee to membersof the C. 
C. 
 the possibility of working at this job for severalyears and then returning to their former jobs. 
 Lenin January 9, 1923 Taken down by M. 
 V. 
 WHAT SHOULD WE DO WITH THE W. 
P. 
I. 
? (continuation) I foresee that this plan will evoke no end of objections, most of which will be prompted by the vicious howl of theworst of the old elements in our state apparatus, who haveremained really old, that is, pre -revolutionary. 
 They will say that this will lead to nothing but complete chaos in thework that the C. 
C. 
 members, not knowing what to do, will loiter about the commissariats and government offices, interfering everywhere with the work, demanding explana -tions, etc. 
, etc. 
 I think that the nature of these objections clearly betrays the source they come from, and are hardly worth answering. 
Obviously, if we had in mind an ordinary type of staff, some of these objections might be warranted. 
 But the thing is, we do not have in mind the usual type of staff for thiscommissariat, but single out for it the best workers, who,on verification by the Party congress, deserve to be electedto the C. 
C. 
 In this way, I believe, we guarantee that thestaff of the People’s Commissariat of the W. 
P. 
I. 
 will be as good as the best of our commissariats, namely, the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs. 
 How do we account for theCommissariat for Foreign Affairs having the best staff ofemployees? In the first place, because diplomats of the oldstamp could not remain there to any noticeable degree;secondly, because we selected people there anew, selected them by entirely new standards, by their fitness for the new tasks; thirdly, because there, in the Foreign Commissariat,we do not have, as in other commissariats, that plethora of haphazardly selected employees who, practically speaking, have inherited all the old qualities of officialdom; and fourthly, because the Foreign Commissariat is working under the direct guidance of our Central Committee. 
 This,as a matter of fact, is the only one of our commissariatsthat has been fully renovated and that is really workingfor the workers’ and peasants’ government and in the spiritof that government, and not merely giving the impression of working for it, while actually, in the main, working against it or in the wrong spirit. 
 Now what conditions are we faced with in our attempt to make a truly renovated apparatus out of the W. 
P. 
I. 
? Thefirst condition—conscientiousness, will be fully ensured byselection; the second condition is the high qualities of the staff members as regards their devotion to the cause and their abilities; the third condition is their closeness tothe highest Party body and their equal rights with thosewho lead our Party, and, through it, the whole of our stateapparatus. 
 It may be said that no amount of conscientiousness or Party authoritativeness can make up for what, in this case, is the most important thing, namely, knowledge of one’sbusiness, knowledge of our state apparatus, and knowledgeof the way it should be remodelled. 
 My reply to this is that one of the essential conditions of my proposal is that we are not to expect quick results in the work of the new commissariat and anticipate that this work will go on for many years. 
 The question thenboils down to organising the work of the new commissariat. 
 And here I feel justified in presuming that both our Party workers and the people now in charge of the W. 
P. 
I. 
have accumulated sufficient experience, sufficient knowledge, sufficient ability and other qualities to properly organise the training of the new C. 
C. 
 members, and a practicaltraining at that, i. 
e. 
, by combining their familiarisationwith all the details of our state apparatus with a study ofwhat modern science has achieved in the bourgeois statesas regards efficient organisation of every kind of staff work.

P. 
I. 
 will start at once, on the basis of five years experience,organising the work on new lines; that it will divide thenew workers into a number of groups and assign the work among these groups systematically; that it will divide these groups into: periodically employed people making apractical study of foreign experience; into people engagedin theoretical work and studying the results of modernscience in the field of organisation of labour generally andmanagerial work in particular. 
 It will arrange for all the W. 
P. 
I. 
 workers to go through the jobs assigned to them, systematically working from the bottom upwards, performingvaried functions in varied fields of administration, in variedlocalities, in varied conditions of work as regardsnationalities, and so on. 
 In short, I assume that the comrades in the W. 
P. 
I. 
 have learned something during these five years and will be able to apply the knowledge they have gained to the new organi -sation of the commissariat. 
 Moreover, it should not beforgotten that we have, I believe, three scientific institutionscarrying out research into problems of work organisation(the Central Institute of Labour, a special group under the W. 
P. 
I. 
 and a group under the Military Commissariat). 
 A meeting of these three groups was held recently, 495 and it is to be hoped that their work will now proceed in a moreefficient manner and in a better team spirit than heretofore. 
 What is the new work organisation that I propose on the part of the Secretariat of our C. 
C. 
? Naturally, the increased number of C. 
C. 
 members will require a new organisation of the work. 
 I must point out, however, that actually we havealready passed to a form of organisation of our C. 
C. 
 plenumsafter the type of highest conferences. 
 The thing now is toorganise the training of these new C. 
C. 
 members in allCentral Committee work and familiarise them with the work of the leading state institutions. 
 If we are late with this, we shall not be fulfilling one of our main duties, namely,that of taking advantage of our being in power in order to teach the best elements of the working people all the details of administration. 
 Such measures as making better arrangements for the meetings of our Politbureau, holding them twice a week and reducing the length of sittings,better preparation of all the documents for these meetingsand arranging for these documents to be at the disposalof all the members of the C. 
C. 
 in good time. 
 These measuresnow follow from the entire course of the work and are essential, so much so that any kind of objection to this is hardly conceivable. 
 Naturally, this will call foran increase in expenditure on secretarial type personnel,but to grudge the money for these expenses would be mostunwise. 
 Besides, frankly speaking, an important advantage in increasing the number of C. 
C. 
 members I consider to be the diminished chances of a personal, incidental elementbeing introduced in its decisions; these decisions will bebetter prepared, the endorsements made at such meetingswill be more thoroughly verified, and as a result there willbe greater stability in our C. 
C. 
. 
 both as regards the continuity of its work and its power to resist splits that might arise from insufficient contact of this body with the masses.

 In the course of 4 minutes he dictated. 
 Felt bad. 
 Doctorscalled. 
 594 Before starting to dictate, he said: “I want to dictate to you a letter to the congress. 
 Take it down”. 
595 Dictated quickly, but his sick condition was obvious. 
 Towards the end he asked what the date was. 
 Why was I so pale, why wasn’t I at the congress,596 was sorry that he was taking up the time that I could have spent there.

 He read and made corrections to his notes on Sukha -nov’s book on the revolution. 
 In the course of 10 -15 minutes dictated a continuation on the same subject. 
599 Was pleased with the new stand that made it easier for him to read books and his own manuscripts. 
 When dictating the sentence “Our Sukhanovs ...” he paused at the words “... never even dream ...” and while ponderingthe continuation, jokingly remarked: “What a memory!I have completely forgotten what I was going to say! Dash it! Extraordinary forgetfulness!” He asked me to type the notes at once and give them to him. 
 Watching him during dictation for several days running I noticed that he did not like to be interrupted in the middleof a sentence, as he lost the thread of his thoughts.

P. 
I.

 Said that Nadezhda Konstantinovna would give him information relating to one part of his article, and askedLydia Alexandrovna to find out the same thing: what andhow many bodies there were dealing with the scientificorganisation of labour, how many congresses had been heldon the subject and what groups had been represented at them. 
 Was there any material in Petrograd? (Khloplyankin 601 had sent the same material as Nadezhda Konstantinovna had, a little more detailed. 
) Asked for a full list of books. 
602 I was with him for about 30 minutes. 
 January /FL00631 (entry by M.

 Vladimir Ilyich did not send for me. 
 January /FL0063/FL0063 (entry by M.

25). 
 Made corrections in the 2nd variant of the W. 
P. 
I. 
article. 
 Finally chose this variant. 
 As his time was limitedhe was in a great hurry. 
 Asked me to put the article in order,retype it and give it to him by the evening. 
 Nadezhda Kon -stantinovna, when letting me in, said he had stolen several minutes to look through the article. 
 Nadezhda Konstantinov -na told me that the nurse (on duty) had not wanted to let me in to him. 
 After I had left, Nadezhda Konstantinovnacame into the secretariat to tell me Vladimir Ilyich’s request“to leave a space in the places, if any, which I had not managed to take down”. 
 She said that Vladimir Ilyich, being in a hurry, imagined that I had difficulty in following him. 
 I asked him to be told that I had taken it all down, and if I had any doubts I would do as he had asked. 
 January /FL00633, (entry by M. 
 A. 
 Volodicheva). 
 Vladimir Ilyich sent for me between 12 and 1 o’clock. 
 Once more glanced through the article mentioned above andmade slight changes. 
 Asked me to insert them in his copy and ours and give one to Maria Ilyinichna for Pravda . 
 Article corrected and handed to Maria Ilyinichna before3 o’clock. 
 He asked whether Lydia Alexandrovna had comeback and whether our holidays were over? January 30 (entry by L. 
 A. 
 Fotieva). 
 On January 24 Vladimir Ilyich sent for Fotieva and gave instructions to ask Dzerzhinsky or Stalin for the materials of the commission on the Georgian question and to makea detailed study of them. 
 This assignment was given toFotieva, Glyasser and Gorbunov. 
 Object—report to VladimirIlyich, who wanted this for the Party congress. 
 Apparently,he did not know the question was up at the Politbureau. 
 603 He said: “Just before I got ill Dzerzhinsky told me aboutthe work of the commission and about the ‘incident’, andthis had a very painful effect upon me. 
” On Thursday, January 25, he asked whether the materials had been received. 
 I answered that Dzerzhinsky would notbe arriving until Saturday. 
 Therefore I had not yet been able to ask him. 
 On Saturday I asked Dzerzhinsky, he said Stalin had the materials. 
 I sent Stalin a letter, but he was out of town. 
Yesterday, January 29, Stalin phoned saying he could notgive the materials without the Politbureau. 
 Asked whetherI had not been telling Vladimir Ilyich things he was not to be told—how was it he was posted about current affairs? For instance, his article about the W. 
P. 
I. 
 showed that certaincircumstances were known to him. 
 I answered that I had notbeen telling anything and had no reason to believe he wasposted about affairs. 
 Today Vladimir Ilyich sent for me tolearn the answer and said that he would fight to get the materials. 
 On January 26 Vladimir Ilyich gave instructions for Tsyu -rupa, Svidersky and Avanesov to be told that if they agree with his article, they should arrange a number of conferences and discuss by way of preparation for the congress whetheror not a plan should be drawn up, a synopsis of textbooks(apparently on the normalisation of labour). 
 Do theyknow the books by Kerzhentsev and Yermansky? 604 There is a plan of scientific organisation of labour, there is a normalisation department at the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection. 
 Today he asked what answer Tsyurupa had given, whether he, Svidersky, Avanesov, and Reske605 agreed with the article. 
 And other members of the Board? I said I didnot know this. 
 He asked, wasn’t Tsyurupa dilly -dallying, procrastinating, was he frank with me. 
 I said I had not had a chance to speak to him yet, I had only given him theinstructions, which he said would be duly carried out. 
 On January 24 Vladimir Ilyich said: “First of all, about this ‘secret’ job of ours—I know that you are deceivingme. 
” To my assurances to the contrary, he answered: “I have my own opinion about that. 
” Today, January 30, Vladimir Ilyich said that yesterday, on asking whether he could address the congress on March30, the doctor had answered in the negative, but had promisedthat he would be up by that time and within a monthwould be allowed newspapers. 
 Reverting to the question of the Georgian commission, he said, laughingly: “That is not newspapers, so I can read it now. 
” Apparently not in a badhumour. 
 No compress on his head. 
 February 1 (entry by L. 
 A. 
 Fotieva). 
 Today Vladimir Ilyich sent for me (at 6. 
30 p. 
m. 
). 
 I told him the Politbureau had permitted the materials to be givenout. 
 606 He gave instructions what to pay attention to and generally how to use them. 
607 Vladimir Ilyich said: “If I were at large (at first he made a slip, then repeated,laughing: if I were at large) I would easily do all thismyself. 
 ” It had been estimated that their study would take 4 weeks. 
 He asked what the attitude of Tsyurupa and the others was towards his article. 
 I answered, according to the direc -tions of Tsyurupa and Svidersky, that Svidersky was fully in agreement. 
 Tsyurupa approved it in the part referring to the enlistment of Central Committee members, and doubted whether it was possible for the Workers’ andPeasants’ Inspection to discharge all its present functionswith a staff reduced to 300 -400 people. 
 I do not know Avanesov’s point of view. 
 Tomorrow there is to be ameeting of the whole Board. 
 He asked whether the question of the article had been up before the Central Committee. 
 I answered that I didnot know this. 
 Vladimir Ilyich was satisfied with thesereports.

 A. 
 Volodicheva).

608 Finished at 12. 
30. 
 Asked Lydia Alexandrovna to come every other day. 
 When asked, “At what time”, he said that he was now a freeman. 
 Casually mentioned that the only time that was ruledout was from 2 to 5; said 6 might do, or to arrange it withhis sister. 
 I had not seen him since January 23. 
 Outwardly, a considerable change for the better: fresh, cheerful looking. 
Dictates, as always, excellently: without halts, seldom ata loss for words, speaks, gesticulating, rather thandictates. 
 609 No compress on his head. 
 February 3 (entry by L. 
 A. 
 Fotieva). 
 Vladimir Ilyich sent for me at 7 o’clock for a few minutes. 
 Asked whether we had looked through the materials. 
I answered that only externally and that they were less thanwe had expected. 
 Asked whether this question had beenup before the Politbureau. 
 I answered that I had no right totalk about it. 
 Asked: “Have you been forbidden to speak precisely and particularly about this?” “No, I have no right generally to talk about current business. 
” “So this is currentbusiness?” I realised that I had made a slip. 
 I repeated thatI had no right to talk. 
 He said: “I heard about this businessfrom Dzerzhinsky before I got ill. 
 Has the commissionreported to the Politbureau? ” “Yes, it has. 
 The Politbureau has endorsed its decision as far as I remember. 
” He said: “Well, I think you will make your report in about three weeks, and then I’ll send them a letter. 
” I answered: “We may not manage it in three weeks. 
” The doctors came (Foerster, who had just arrived, Kozhevnikov and Kramer)and I went away. 
 Looked cheerful and buoyant, perhapssomewhat excited at Foerster’s visit—Foerster had not seenhim for some time. 
 February 4, (entry by M. 
 A. 
 Volodicheva). 
 Vladimir Ilyich sent for me today round about 6 o’clock. 
 Asked whether I did not mind him calling me on holidays. 
 (“You must take a rest, too, sometimes, mustn’t you?”) Dictated continuation of his article “Better Fewer, But Better” for over half an hour. 
 Looked fresh, voice cheerful. 
No compress. 
 Ended with the words: “Well, that’ll do for thetime being. 
 I’m a bit tired. 
” Asked me to type it out andphone him when I had finished, as he would probably continue the article that day; said it was an old habit of his to write with the manuscript in front of him, other -wise he found it difficult to write. 
 Nadezhda Konstantinovna told me that the German doctor (Foerster) had seen him, had told him a lot of pleasantthings, allowed him to do gymnastic exercises and allowed him extra time for dictating articles, and that Vladimir Ilyich was very pleased. 
 At 8 o’clock he sent for me again. 
 He did not dictate, however, but looked through what he had written and madeamendments. 
 When he had finished he said that beforesending the article to the press he wanted to show it to Tsyurupa and perhaps some other members of his board and intended to make certain additions to these thoughtsof his. 
 Dictated more slowly than usual. 
 Compress on hishead. 
 Face went pale. 
 Obviously tired. 
 February 5, (entry by M. 
 A. 
 Volodicheva). 
 Today Vladimir Ilyich called me in at 12 o’clock. 
 I was with him three -quarters of an hour. 
 Dictated slowly. 
 In one place, finding difficulty to express himself, he said: “It doesn’t go smoothly with me today somehow, not briskly” (he stressed the word). 
 Asked for his article “How We Should Reorganise the W. 
P. 
I. 
” Read it for 3 or 4 minutes in silence. 
 Then he continued a little longer and decided to stop, saying he would call me in today at 4 or 5, maybe 6 o’clock. 
 February 5, evening (entry by M. 
 I. 
 Glyasser). 
 Vladimir Ilyich sent for Lydia Alexandrovna at 7 o’clock (ten to 7), but as she was indisposed he sent for me. 
 Asked whether we had started sorting out the materials of the Georgian commission and by what date we planned to finish this work. 
 I answered that we had distributed thematerials and begun to read them, and as for the date, weexpected to keep the deadline he had given us, that is, threeweeks. 
 He asked how we intended to read the materials. 
I said we had come to the conclusion that it was necessary for each of us to read everything. 
 “Is that your unanimous decision?” “Yes. 
” Vladimir Ilyich began to figure out howmuch time was left until the congress. 
 When I said a monthand 25 days, he said that this term was probably sufficient,but if extra information was required, it might prove toolittle, all the more considering that it would take still longer to go to the Caucasus. 
 He asked how much each of us was working, and said that in case of need we could useVolodicheva and Shushanika Manucharyants. 
 Then he askedwhether the decision for all to read everything had beenformally adopted. 
 I answered that we had no record of thisdecision in writing and asked whether he had anything against it maybe. 
 He said that he would like us all to read everything, of course, but the tasks of our commission werevery indefinite. 
 On the one hand, he would not like to giveus too much trouble, but on the other, we have to reckonwith the need for widening these tasks as the work progressesIt may be necessary to obtain additional material. 
 He asked where the materials were being kept, how we use them, whether we would make a brief summary of all the materialsand whether we would have it typed (“wouldn’t it be toomuch trouble?”). 
 Finally, Vladimir Ilyich decided thatin the course of the next week we would decide how muchtime we needed and in what form we would handle these materials, and in handling them we would be guided by the necessity of drawing up a general survey of all the data onthe points which the commission had mapped out as well as on those questions which he would put to us in the course of the work. 
 Then Vladimir Ilyich ordered inquiries to be made of Popov as to how things stood with the working up of thecensus materials of the Central Statistical Board in Petro -grad, Moscow and Kharkov (if a census in the last -named city was carried out), and by what date he intends to havethem worked up and whether they would be published. 
 610 Vladimir Ilyich would like to see them in print before theParty congress; he considers that in view of the specialimportance of this census the materials ought to be publishedeven though those of previous censuses had not beenpublished and Popov had only sent Vladimir Ilyich thetables. 
 Popov, therefore, had to be got moving. 
 An official inquiry should be sent to him about this, following a pre -liminary talk. 
 I was with Vladimir Ilyich altogether 20 minutes. 
 I was seeing him for the first time since his illness. 
 I thought helooked well and cheerful, only slightly paler than before. 
Speaks slowly, gesticulating with his left hand and stirring the fingers of his right. 
 No compress on his head. 
 February 6, evening (entry by M. 
 A. 
 Volodicheva). 
 Vladimir Ilyich called me in between 7 and 9. 
 I was there for about an hour and a half. 
 First he began to read hisarticle “Better Fewer, But Better”. 
 The corrections, made in red ink, put Vladimir Ilyich in a good humour (not the corrections themselves, but the way they were inserted!). 
The article at his request had not been retyped, and thefirst deciphered copy had had the corrections added to itwhich Vladimir Ilyich had made during his reading. 
 The corrections having been made not in proof -reader style, but in the ordinary secretarial way, Vladimir Ilyich, on second reading, found this inconvenient. 
 He asked that thenext time the whole thing should be retyped anew. 
 Running through the article, Vladimir Ilyich made passing remarks, spoke about his old habit of writing and not dictating; thathe understood now why stenographers do not satisfy him(“did not satisfy him,” he said); that he was accustomed toseeing his manuscript in front of him, stopping, pausingto think over difficult passages, passages in which he had “got stuck”, walking up and down the room, even running away to take a walk somewhere; that even now he often felt like seizing a pencil and writing or introducing correc -tions himself. 
 He recollected how he tried to dictate an article of his to Trotsky’s stenographer back in 1918, and how, when hefelt himself getting “stuck”, he “plunged” on in confusionwith “incredible” speed, and how this led to his having had to burn the whole manuscript, after which he sat down to write himself and wrote “The Renegade Kautsky”, 611 with which he was pleased. 
 Vladimir Ilyich talked about all this very gaily, laughing his infectious laugh. 
 I had never seen him in such a mood. 
He went on dictating part of this article. 
 Dictation lasted 15 -20 minutes. 
 He stopped the dictation himself. 
 February 7 (entry by L. 
 A. 
 Fotieva). 
 Vladimir Ilyich sent for me. 
 Spoke on 3 questions. 
 1) On the results of the census (asked to be shown the proofs of the census book. 
 I said there would have to be Stalin’s permission for this). 
 2) On the Georgian commission. 
 Asked how the work was getting on, when we would finish reading, when we wouldget together, and so on. 
 3) On the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection. 
 Did the Board now intend to make any decision, “to take a step of state importance” or was it putting things off until thecongress. 
 Said he was writing an article, but was not gettingon with it at all, nevertheless he was thinking of revisingit and giving it to Tsyurupa to read before sending it to thepress. 
 Gave instructions to ask Tsyurupa whether he was to hurry up with this article or not. 
 Today Kozhevnikov said that there was a tremendous improvement in Vladimir Ilyich’s health. 
 He was nowmoving his arm and had begun to believe himself that hewould regain the use of it. 
 February 7, morning (entry by M. 
 A. 
 Volodicheva). 
 I was with Vladimir Ilyich at about 12. 
30. 
 Said that he would dictate on any subjects and arrange the material at some future time. 
 Dictated on the subject of 1) how Party and administrative bodies could be merged, and 2) whether it was convenient to combine educational activities with official activities. 
 At the words “And the more abrupt the revolution ...” he stopped, repeated them several times, obviously strugglingwith them; asked me to help him, re -read the preceding pas -sages, laughed and said “Here I’ve got completely stuck, I’m afraid, make a note of that—stuck on this very spot!” To my remark that I was his unavoidable evil for a short space of time, as he would soon be able to write himself,he said: “Oh, that won’t be so soon!” His voice soundedweary, with a hint of pain in it. 
 February 7, evening (entry by M. 
 A. 
 Volodicheva). 
 Vladimir Ilyich called me between 7 and 9. 
 Was with him for about an hour and a half. 
 Completed the sentence atwhich he had stopped yesterday. 
 Said: “I shall now tryto develop the next subject. 
” There and then asked aboutthe subjects he had already noted previously 612; when these were read out, he remarked that one of them he had forgotten (on the correlation between the Central Board for VocationalEducation and the general educational work among thepeople). 
 Dictated the general part of his article “BetterFewer, But Better”. 
 Dictated fast and freely, withoutdifficulty, gesticulating. 
 On finishing, said he would try later to fit this part in with his article as a whole. 
 Tired. 
 In the evening I learnedfrom Nadezhda Konstantinovna that Vladimir Ilyich wouldnot dictate tomorrow; he intended to read. 
 February 9 (entry by L. 
 A. 
 Fotieva). 
 In the morning Vladimir Ilyich sent for me. 
 Confirmed that he would move the question of the Workers’ andPeasant’s Inspection at the congress. 
 As for the census, hewas worried whether the tables would be printed the way theyshould be. 
 Agreed to my suggestion that instructions forhaving this checked should be put through Kamenev or Tsyurupa. 
 The assignment to be given to Krzhizhanovsky or Svidersky. 
 Mood and appearance excellent. 
 Said thatFoerster was inclined to allow him to receive visitors rather than newspapers, On my remarking that this really would seem to be the best from the medical point of view, he said very gravely after a thoughtful pause that in his opinion it would be worse precisely from the medical point of view,because printed matter could be read and done with, whereasvisits evoke an exchange February 9, morning (entry by M. 
 A. 
 Volodicheva). 
 Vladimir Ilyich called me in a little after 12. 
 Said the retyped stuff pleased him better. 
 Read the part of the articlehe had dictated yesterday, made practically no corrections. 
On finishing, said: “I think I’ve made a good job of it. 
”I had the impression that he was very pleased with thatpart of his article. 
 Asked me to take down the end: “That is how I link up ...”, etc. 
 I stayed for about an hour. 
 February 9, evening . 
 Vladimir Ilyich sent for Lydia Alexandrovna. 
 Nadezhda Konstantinovna asked her to be given the general part of thearticle, as Vladimir Ilyich wanted her to read it. 
 February 10 (entry by L. 
 A. 
 Fotieva). 
 Called me in a little past 6. 
 Asked that the article “Better Fewer, But Better” be given to Tsyurupa to read, if possiblewithin 2 days. 
 Asked for listed books. 
 613 Looks tired, speaks with great difficulty, losing the thread of his thoughts and confusing words. 
 Compress on his head. 
 February 1/FL0063 (entry by L. 
 A. 
 Fotieva). 
 Vladimir Ilyich is worse. 
 Bad headache. 
 Called me in for several minutes. 
 According to Maria Ilyinichna, the doctors had upset him so much that his lips quivered. 
 Foerster the day before had said that he was emphatically prohibitednewspapers, visitors and political information. 
 Asked whathe meant by the latter, Foerster replied: “Well, this, forexample. 
 You are interested in the census of Soviet employ -ees. 
” The fact that the doctors knew about this upset Vladimir Ilyich. 
 Apparently, furthermore, Vladimir Ilyich had the impression that it was not the doctors who gave instructions to the Central Committee, but the Central Committee that gave instructions to the doctors. 
 Talked with me about the same 3 subjects, pleaded a headache. 
 I said jokingly that I would treat him by sugges -tion and in two days he would have no more headaches. 
 February 14 (entry by L. 
 A. 
 Fotieva). 
 Vladimir Ilyich sent for me a little after 12. 
 No headache. 
 Said that he was quite well. 
 That his was a nervous illness, that sometimes he felt quite well, i. 
e. 
, his head quite clear, but sometimes he felt worse. 
 Therefore we had to hurry withhis requests, as he wanted to put some things through withoutfail in time for the congress and hoped that he would manageit. 
 But if we dragged it out and thus ruined the business,he would be very very annoyed. 
 The doctors came and we had to break off. 
 February 14, evening . 
 Called me in again. 
 Impediment in speech, obviously tired. 
 Spoke again on the three points of his instructions. 
In special detail on the subject that agitated him most of all, namely, the Georgian question. 
 Asked to hurry things up. 
 Gave certain instructions. 
 614 March 5 (entry by M. 
 A. 
 Volodicheva). 
 Vladimir Ilyich did not send for me until round about 12. 
 Asked me to take down two letters: one to Trotsky,615 the other to Stalin616; the first letter to be telephoned personally to Trotsky and the answer given to him as soon as possible. 
As to the second letter, he asked it to be put off, saying thathe was not very good at it that day. 
 He wasn’t feeling toogood. 
 March 6 (entry by M. 
 A. 
 Volodicheva). 
 Asked about a reply to the first letter (reply over the tele -phone was taken down in shorthand). 
 Read the second letter(to Stalin) and asked it to be handed to him personally andreceive the answer from his own hands. 
 Dictated a letterto the Mdivani group. 
 617 Felt bad. 
 Nadezhda Konstantinov -na asked that this letter to Stalin should not be sent, and itwas held up throughout the 6th. 
 On the 7th I said I had to carry out Vladimir Ilyich’s instructions. 
 She spoke to Kamenev, and the letter was handed to Stalin and Kamenev, and afterwards to Zinoviev when he got back from Petrograd. 
 Stalin’s answer was received immediately on receipt of Vladimir Ilyich’s letter (the letter was handed to Stalin personally by me and his answer to Vladimir Ilyich dictated to me). 
 The letter has not yet been handed to Vladimir Ilyich, as he has fallen ill .

 2 NOTES 1 2 3Vikzhel —the All -Russia Executive Committee of the Railwaymen’s Trade Union, which was set up at the First All -Russia Inaugural Congress of the Railwaymen held in Moscow in July -August 1917. 
 The Executive was controlled by the Mensheviks and Socialist -Revolutionaries. 
 After the victory of the armed uprising inPetrograd this Executive Committee became a bulwark of the counter-revolution. 
 Taking refuge behind statements declaring its neutrality and calling for cessation of the civil war, Vikzhel hindered the dispatch of revolutionary troops from Petrograd to Moscow, where fighting was still going on for the establishment of Soviet power, and threatened to stop railway traffic. 
 On October 29 (November 11), 1917, Vikzhel adopted a resolution calling for the establishment of a new, “homogeneous socialist government” to include representatives of all the parties “from the Bolsheviks to the Popular Socialists”. 
 Vikzhel’s counter -revolutionary policy and actions were strongly disapproved by the rank and file. 
 At the All-Russia Emergency Congress of the Railwaymen held in January 1918 Vikzhel was dismissed, and a new governing body of the Railwaymen’s Union, Vikzhedor, was elected in which the Bolsheviks formed the preponderant majority.

 35 The Draft Decree on the Requisition of Articles of Warm Clothing for the Soldiers at the Front was discussed and approved at a meeting of the Petrograd Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies on November 8 (21), 1917. 
 Lenin’s addenda in regard to the requisitioning of articles of warm clothing were taken into consideration in the final wording of the decree (see Pravda No. 
 184, November 22 [9], 1917). 
 On the question of “the requisition of flats of the rich to relieve the needs of the poor”. 
 Lenin’s amendment formed the basis of a Draft Decree on Installing the Families of Red Armymen and Unemployed Workers in the Flats of the Bourgeoisie and on the Normalisation of Housing which was approved at a meeting of the Petrograd Soviet on March 1, 1918 (see Izvestia No. 
 38, March 2, 1918). 
 p. 
 36 This refers to the elections to the Constituent Assembly in the Petrograd Electoral Area held between November 12 (25) and 14 (27), 1917. 
 These elections, the preliminary results of which became known on November 15 (28) and the final results the next day, gave the Bolshevik Party 424,000 votes and 6 seats in the Constituent Assembly (out of the twelve assigned to Petrograd); the Cadets received 247,000 votes (4 seats); the Socialist -Revolutionaries 152,000 votes (2 seats, one of them won by theLeft S. 
R. 
s). 
 The terms “President of the Council of National Commissioners” and “Social Revolutionists” used by the correspondent are better known as “Chairman of the Council of People’s Commissars” and “Socialist-Revolutionaries”. 
 p. 
 36 At the elections to the district councils of Petrograd held at the end of May and beginning of June 1917 the Bolshevik tickets received 20 per cent of the votes. 
 At the elections to the City Council of Petrograd on August 20 (September 2) the Bolsheviks received 33 per cent of all the votes. 
 In speaking of the September elections Lenin was probably referring to the elections to the district councils of Moscow (held on September 24 [October 7], 1917) at which the Bolsheviks received 51 per cent of all the votes. 
 This voting, Lenin pointed out, “is in general one of the most striking symptoms of the profound change which has taken place in the mood of the whole nation” (see present edition, Vol. 
 26, p.

 The decree was an attempt to enlist the co -operation of the All -Russia Food Council, which set itself against the People’s Commissariat for Food and sabotaged the measures of the Soviet authorities. 
 The first Soviet Food Congress, which opened in Petrograd on January 14 (27) and was attended by delegates to the Third All -Russia Congress of Soviets, abolished the Food Council and other organisations handling the food business, and concentrated this business in the hands of the Soviet authorities.

 p. 
 60 On January 14 127), 1918, a revolution started in Finland and power passed into the hands of the proletariat. 
 In February, on the initiative of the workers’ government of Finland—the Council of People’s Representatives—negotiations were commenced for signing a peace treaty between the Russian and Finnish socialist Republics. 
 The draft treaty drawn up by the Russo -Finnish Con -ciliation Board was discussed at meetings of the Council of People’sCommissars held on February 25, 27 and 28. 
 The treaty was signed by representatives of the contracting parties on March 1. 
 Lenin took an active part in drawing up the treaty. 
 He talked with the delegates of the Finnish workers’ government, who had been authorised to sign the treaty, and he edited the draft (see Lenin Miscellany XXI , pp. 
 241-43). 
 This was the first treaty in history between two socialist repub -lics, an example of a new type of international relationships—fraternal, friendly relationships between equal sovereign states where the working class had come to power.

 Balfour, the British Foreign Minister, in the House of Commons on March 14, 1918, in which the latter tried to cover up the true aims of the Japanese inter -vention by hypocritically alleging that in occupying Siberiawith the consent of the Allies, and seizing the Siberian railway, Japan would be preventing a German invasion of northern Asia. 
 p.

 On April 23 the C. 
P. 
C. 
 adopted the decree in toto with Lenin’s addendum and the next day finally endorsed it with certain amendments (a new clause was inserted). 
 Therefore Lenin’s addendum in the text published in Izvestia No. 
 84 for April 27, 1918, applies to §7 of the Decree on Supplying Agriculture With Implements and Metals (see Decrees of the Soviet Government , Vol.

 After a lengthy discussion, the section, under pressure from the “Left” Communists, adopted the Regulations, which ran counter to the policy of the Party and the Government. 
 On learn -ing of the speeches of the “Left” Communists on the questionof management of the nationalised enterprises (see Collected Works , Vol. 
 50, Fifth Russian edition, p. 
 84) and reading the Regulations drafted by the section, Lenin proposed that they be examined at the Conciliation Board specially set up on June 2 and at which the C.

 The draft decree was adopted with substantial amendments. 
 The All -Russia Central Executive Committee endorsed the decree on June 11 and Izvestia published it on June 16, 1918 (see Decrees of the Soviet Government , Vol.

 In 1921 it became the organ of the Communist Party of Sweden, after the split in the party in October 1929 the newspaper passed into the hands of the party’s Right wing. 
 Publication ceased in May 1945. 
 p. 
 101 This refers to the disarming of the anarchists by the security forces in Moscow on the night of April 12, 1918. 
 This measure was necessitated by the fact that the various groups of anarchists served as a screen for counter -revolutionary and criminal ele -ments who terrorised the population by their raids and robberiesand took refuge in the villas which the anarchists had seized. 
 The anarchists in Petrograd, who failed to comply with the demand for the surrender of firearms, were disarmed on April 23, 1918. 
 Anarkhia (Anarchy)—an anarchist literary and socio-economic newspaper published in Moscow from September 1917 to July 1918; by order of the Vecheka it was closed down on April 13; publication was resumed on April 21, 1918.

 The hall was crowded to overflowing with workers and Red Armymen. 
 A sol -dier made a speech on behalf of the First Reserve Artillery Brigadein which he said that in the person of Lenin they greeted the Council of People s Commissars and were ready to defend the workers and peasants government at the Council’s first call.

 107 The question of introducing a tax in kind was raised by Lenin in his Theses on the Food Question written on August 2, 1918 (see present edition Vol. 
 28, pp. 
 45-47). 
 The draft decree for imposing a tax in kind on the farmers was first introduced at a meeting of the C. 
P. 
C. 
 on September 4. 
 It was discussed again at a meeting of the C. 
P. 
C. 
 on September 21. 
 It was probably during these meetings of the Council that Lenin jotted down his “Main Provisions of the Decree and his remarks on the draft. 
 (For Lenin’s documents connected with the drafting of the decree at this and other meetings of the Council of People’s Commissars— notes calculations plan of a speech at the Council meeting— see also Lenin Miscellany XVIII , pp. 
 148 -50. 
) The decree in its final form was adopted by the C. 
P. 
C. 
 on October 26 endorsed by the All -Russia Central Executive Committee on October 30 and published in Izvestia on November 14, 1918. 
 The extension of foreign military intervention and the civil war prevented this measure from being implemented. 
 Lenin’s principles for an income tax in kind drafted in 1918 were elaborated and embodied in the food tax in the spring of 1921 which marked the post -war transition to peaceful econom -ic construction on the basis of the New Economic Policy. 
 The 98 99 100 101decree on the tax in kind adopted in October 1918 was mentioned by Lenin in his report on the political work of the C. 
C. 
 at the Tenth Congress of the R.

” Article 17 of the Law says: “The surplus income derived from naturally fertile superior plots as well as from their more advantageous location for marketing, shall be placed at the disposal of the Soviet authorities to be used for public needs” ( Decrees of the Soviet Government , Vol. 
 I, Moscow, 1957, pp. 
 408-09). 
 p. 
 108 At a meeting of the C. 
P. 
C. 
 on October 15, 1918, the People’s Commissariat for Food tabled a proposal that 40 million rubles be allocated for the upkeep of the Poor Peasants’ Committees, apparently for a period of six months at the rate of 6. 
5 million rubles per month. 
 In view of the impending amalgamation of these committees with the local Soviets, Lenin proposed a 2 -month allocation of funds (“2 862=13”). 
 The C. 
P. 
C. 
 adopted Lenin’s proposal for the allocation of 13 million rubles; the other proposals of Lenin’s were also included in the decision of the C. 
P. 
C. 
 (see Decrees of the Soviet Government , Vol. 
 III, Moscow, 1964, pp. 
 593 -95). 
 p. 
 109 This was written by Lenin in connection with the discussion by the C. 
P.

 of the report of the Board of Three on logging under the Supreme Economic Council. 
 All Lenin’s proposals were incorporated in the decision adopted by the C. 
P. 
C. 
 on this question. 
 The latter allocated 100 million rubles for logging operations, demanded an account of their expenditure within a week and ordered the Board of Three, within the same period to submit more concrete information on the questions formulated by Lenin.

P. 
C. 
 on November 21. 
 Lenin’s addenda were included in the adopted text of the decree, which was published in Izvestia on November 24. 
 The question of the co -operatives’ participation in the organi -sation of supply for the population as dealt with in the draftdecree with Lenin’s addenda to it, was misunderstood by some of the leading food supply workers. 
 Lenin clarified this question in a speech delivered at a meeting of delegates from the Moscow Central Workers’ Co-operative on November 26, 1918, in a report on the attitude of the proletariat to petty -bourgeois demo -crats made at a Moscow Party workers’ meeting on November 27,and in his reply to the discussion (see present edition, Vol.

 Lenin was appointed Chairman of the Council of Defence. 
 The documents published here were written by Lenin at the first meeting of the Council of Defence on December 1, 1918. 
 First Lenin outlined the immediate tasks of the Council and the agenda for its first sitting (Document 1). 
 Then he jotted down a number of proposals for elaborating these questions, formulat -ing more detailed proposals on the food question (Documents 2and 3). 
 Lenin’s proposals were reflected in the decisions of the Council of Defence adopted at its sitting (see Lenin Miscellany XVIII , pp.

 It took into account the opinions expressed by the commis -sion members. 
 Lenin’s draft was adopted by the commissionand included in its minutes. 
 In the Minutes of the Fuel Commis-sion points 1, 2, 3, 4 are given under a special heading “Decisionsof the Commission Having the Force of Defence Council Deci-sions”.

 The commission, chaired by Lenin, held its first meeting on December 3. 
 This rough draft was probably made by Lenin during the meeting. 
 All points of these proposals with the exception of the two last paragraphs were later crossed out by Lenin. 
 The commission’s decisions were formulated on the basis of Lenin’s proposals.

 119 120 121 122Lenin’s letter to Chicherin was written in connection with the preparations for the first congress of the Comintern. 
 Already at the beginning of the first world war, when the collapse of the Second International occurred as a result of most of the leaders of the socialist parties in the West adopting a social -chauvinist stand, Lenin put forward the idea of founding a new,truly revolutionary International and pressed forward with a campaign to unite the Left socialist forces in the international labour movement. 
 The victory of the October Socialist Revolu-tion and its growing impact upon the international revolutionarymovement, and the emergence of Communist Parties or groups in a number of capitalist countries made this task more urgent than ever and created favourable conditions for its solution. 
 The urgent need for uniting the Communists was further dictated by the fact that the opportunist, social-chauvinist leaders had made an attempt to revive the Second International. 
 The leader -ship of the British Labour Party had addressed a proposal to thesocialists of all countries to convene in Lausanne on January 6, 1919, an international socialist conference to rehabilitate the Second International. 
 In reply to this proposal the Central Com-mittee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) circulatedon December 24, 1918, a radio-telegram calling on all revolu -tionary internationalist elements to refuse to take part “inconferences of enemies of the working class wearing the mask of socialism” ( Pravda No. 
 281, December 25, 1918). 
 At the same time Lenin, as his letter to Chicherin shows, raised the question of convening without delay an international conference of Commu-nists and Left Social -Democrats with the aim of founding the Third International. 
 p. 
 119 This refers to E. 
 Fuchs, a member of the Central Council of the Spartakusbund . 
 He arrived in Moscow from Berlin at the end of December 1918 to inform Lenin of the situation in Germany. 
 p. 
 119 A report was drawn up for Lenin on December 31 characterising the parties and organisations mentioned in his list. 
 In addition to those given by Lenin the report gave the names of eight more organisations. 
 It also suggested inviting representatives of the Chinese, Korean and Persian revolutionary workers to the con -ference in the capacity of guests. 
 The same day Lenin received the draft of an appeal “To the First Congress of the Communist International” written at his request and in keeping with his proposals. 
 Lenin made a number of important amendments to the draft. 
 In January 1919 the draft appeal “To the First Congress of the Communist International” was submitted by Lenin at a meeting of representatives of a number of communist and socialist parties and organisations. 
 After a discussion, the meeting adopted the draft. 
 The appeal was published in the press on January 24, 1918. 
 123 124125 126 127 128 129The First Congress of the Communist International was held on March 2 -6, 1919 (see present edition, Vol.

 Lenin’s addendum to Point 1 was written in the margin probably after the writing of the draft decision as a whole. 
 The beginning of Point 1 of the C. 
P. 
C.

C. 
 adopted a new detailed resolution on the food policy in the Ukraine. 
 On one of the pages of the typewritten text of this resolution, which is kept in the Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism -Leninism, Lenin had written: “Endorsed 11.

 125 Lenin’s unfinished article “On the Appeal of the German Independents” was written in the latter part of February 1919. 
 The appeal is criticised in §21 of Lenin’s theses on bourgeois democracy and the dictatorship of the proletariat (see present edition, Vol. 
 28, p. 
 467). 
 p. 
 126 130 131 132 133 134 135Lenin is referring to the meeting of the enlarged International Socialist Commission ( Internationale Sozialistische Kommission ) held in Berne on February 5 -9, 1916. 
 It was attended by 22 dele -gates from the internationalists of a number of countries: Ger -many, Russia, Italy, Norway, Austria, Poland, Switzerland, Bulgaria and Rumania. 
 Lenin took an active part in the pro -ceedings. 
 The meeting adopted an appeal “To All AffiliatedParties and Groups” denouncing the participation of socialists in bourgeois governments, the slogan of “Defence of the father-land” in the imperialist war, and voting for war loans; it pointedto the necessity of supporting the labour movement and pre-paring mass revolutionary action against the imperialist war. 
The appeal, however, suffered from inconsistency in that it failed to demand a break with social-chauvinism and opportunism. 
 In voting for the text of the appeal, the members of the Zimmer -wald Left declared at the meeting that although they did notconsider all its points satisfactory, they were voting for it because they regarded it as a step forward in comparison with the decisions of the First International Socialist Conference at Zimmerwald. 
 The meeting fixed the date for convening a second international socialist conference.

 131 The Extraordinary Plenary Meeting of the Moscow Soviet of April 3, 1919 , was held jointly with representatives of the district Soviets, factory committees and trade union executives in connection with the aggravation of the food situation in Moscow and the 136 137 138 139consequent agitation carried on among the railwaymen by the Mensheviks and Socialist -Revolutionaries. 
 The latter called upon the railwaymen to strike and sabotage work in the railway repair shops. 
 This counter -revolutionary agitation led to a strike in the shops of the Alexandrovsky Railway as a result of which the central workshops were closed on March 31 by order of the People’s Commissariat for Railways and work in them was not resumed until April 3, after the kulak elements had been dismissed. 
 Lenin made a report at the meeting on the domestic and foreign situation of the Soviet Republic. 
 A report on the state of railway transport was made by L. 
 B. 
 Krasin, and on the food policy by A. 
 I. 
 Svidersky. 
 Speakers in the debate denounced the counter -revolutionary agitation of the Mensheviks and Social -ist-Revolutionaries. 
 In winding up the debate, A. 
 V. 
 Lunacharsky moved the resolution on the domestic and foreign situation of the Soviet Republic drafted by Lenin. 
 This volume contains the original version of this draft resolution. 
 The meeting of the Moscow Soviet also adopted a special resolution branding the counter -revolutionary agitation and approving the measures taken by the Commissariat for Railways in regard to the Alexandrovsky railway shops.

” The resolution goes on to say that “the most urgent task in the Ukraine is to make maximum use of fuel, metals, existing factories and workshops, and also stocks of food”. 
 Pointing out that the whole industry of the Ukraine was concentrated in the eastern part of the republic and that the transfer of the Economic Council from Kharkov to Kiev had adversely affected the rehabil -itation of transport and of the mining and manufacturing indus -tries of the Ukraine, the C. 
C. 
 of the R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
) recognised the need for the Economic Council as well as the Special Commission for Army Supplies of the Ukraine being located in Kharkov or having competent agencies in Kharkov authorised to deal di -rectly with Moscow and to receive money appropriations directlyfrom Moscow. 
 The C. 
C. 
 of the Party emphasised that “the Ukrain-ian railways are an inseparable part of the Russian railwaynetwork and are managed by the People’s Commissariat for Railways from Moscow. 
 ” The resolution also states that “the People’s Commissariat for State Control of the R.

 For “Draft C.

 The military union of the Soviet Republics was officially implemented on June 1, 1919, by a decree of the All -Russia Central Executive Committee “On the Unification of the Soviet Republics of Russia, the Ukraine, Latvia, Lithuania and Byelorussia for Fighting World Imperialism”. 
 p. 
 135 On April 21, 1919, Lenin made a report “On Stepping Up Work in the Field of Military Defence” at a meeting of the Council of Defence. 
 The document printed here is apparently a rough draft of the concluding part of the resolution on this question.

 135 This postscript was written to Béla Kun’s appeal on behalf of the Soviet Government of Hungary to the Hungarian soldiers serving in the Red Army. 
 “You, Hungarian internationalists,” 142 143 144 145the appeal stated, “who are fighting on Russian soil against the bands of Kolchak and counter -revolution, are also fighting for the Hungarian Soviet Republic just as your comrades are doing in Hungary, for Hungary and Russia today form a single whole. 
” This appeal was issued in April 1919 in Hungarian and promulgated on the civil war fronts.

 on May 2, 1919, in connection with the discussion of measures to alleviate the position of the workers. 
 p. 
 136 On May 31, 1919, the Council of Defence considered questions relating to mobilisation. 
 The Council endorsed the decree drafted by Lenin (see pp. 
 138 -39 of this volume) and decisions directing the People’s Commissariat for Food to provide the mobilised men with food and ordering the conscription status of employees in all departments and institutions to be checked with the object of placing at the disposal of the military command all such persons who were liable for service in the armed forces and who couldbe replaced without great detriment to the work by persons who were not liable or by women. 
 p. 
 137 The Council of Defence on May 24, 1919, passed a decision allowing Red Armymen of frontline units operating in the rich grain-producing districts to send food parcels to their families in thefamine-stricken areas. 
 The Council ordered the Central Committee of the Food Army to submit not later than June 1 a draft of detailed instructions for the implementation of this decision. 
 The draft was endorsed by the Council of Defence on July 23, 1919. 
 p. 
 139 Mamontov’s mounted corps was launched by Denikin for attacks behind the lines of the Soviet troops on the Southern Front. 
 On August 10, 1919, Mamontov’s cavalry broke through the front in the vicinity of Novokhopersk and raided several towns and villages. 
 This cavalry raid created a threat to the Soviet troops, made offensive operations difficult and interfered with army control and supply in a number of places. 
 The Party and the Government took emergency measures to fight Mamontov’s cavalry. 
 On August 23 the Council of Defence declared martial law in Ryazan, Tula, Orel, Voronezh, Tambov and Penza gubernias, on the territory of which all power was vested in the Revolutionary Committees. 
 These were responsible for organising defence against whiteguard attacks and suppressing counter -revolutionary 146 147 148 149actions. 
 Lenin attached great importance to the organisation of Mamontov’s defeat. 
 The latter’s corps was routed in October -November 1919. 
 p. 
 141 Lenin had repeatedly demanded that the Revolutionary Military Council of the Republic, headed by Trotsky, take drastic meas -ures to fight Mamontov’s troops. 
 On September 16, 1919, Leninwrote: “Inaction against Mamontov. 
 Evidently, there has been one delay after another. 
 The troops marching on Voronezh from the North were late. 
 We were late in transferring the 21st Divi-sion to the South. 
 We were late with the armoured cars.

 143 The decision of the Politbureau accompanying Lenin’s note was adopted in connection with Chicherin’s letter to Lenin dated September 26, 1919, in which Chicherin asked for instruc -tions on the following points: 1) could an appeal be made withoutthe decision of the C. 
C. 
 of the R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
) to the workers of the Entente countries to bring pressure to bear on their Governments not to interfere in the Soviet state’s negotiations with the Baltic states for concluding peace treaties? 2) Should we make new peace proposals to the Entente countries in the name of the Soviet Government? “This,” wrote Chicherin, “would be construed as a sign of weakness .... 
 On the other hand, it would give an opening to the opponents of intervention, especially to the trade unions”; 3) Could we take advantage of Litvinov’s proposed trip to a neutral country to negotiate an exchange of prisoners of war with the English representatives in order to “throw out a feeler on the question of peace”? 4) In the event of Litvinov’s mission being a failure would it be worth while asking A. 
 M. 
 Gorky, who intend-ed to make an appeal for peace, to mention in his letter “ourinvariable desire for peace and to point out to the Governments of the Entente the risk of the struggle being turned into annihila-tion”? (underlined by Lenin). 
 “However,” wrote Chicherin, “we should much prefer an official peace proposal...” (Central Party Archives Institute of Marxism -Leninism of the C.

 The newspaper carried on an active campaign to strengthen the alliance between the working class and the peasantry, to organise and rally the mass of the poor and middle peasants behind the Communist Party and the Soviet Government. 
 Bednota played an important role in promoting the political education and raising the cultural level of the labouring peasantry, in advancing public-spirited activists from among the rural poor and the middle peasantry, and training a numerous army of rural correspondents. 
 On February 1, 1931, Bednota merged with the newspaper Sotsialisticheskoye Zemledeliye (Socialist Agriculture).

 On October 3 a town Party meeting had been held in Ivanovo -Voznesensk at which every Party member was called upon to spare no effort to defeat Denikin’s army, and the Party organ -isations were called upon to start mobilising Communists forthe front. 
 On October 9 the Bureau of the Ivanovo-Voznesensk Gubernia Committee passed a decision to announce a general Party mobilisation. 
 In a short period about 350 men were mobilised. 
 The first group was seen off on October 22 and arrived in Moscow on October 24. 
 In a letter to the Revolutionary Military Council of the Southern Front Lenin wrote: “I heartily recommend the bearer, Comrade Stepan Nazarov, a Bolshevik whom I have known personally for a long time. 
 “Together with other Ivanovo -Voznesensk comrades they formed a well-planned organised group (of from 300 to 500 men) for giving all -round service to and raising the morale of a whole army.

 p. 
 154 This refers to the agreement between the Commissariat for Rail -ways and the Food Commissariat on the question of the trans -portation of grain from the producing to the consuming areas. 
 “The agreement,” stated the Council’s decision, “should ensure regular deliveries to Moscow of such a quantity of breadstuffs as was necessary for its class ration distribution” (Central Party Archives, Institute of Marxism -Leninism of the C.

C. 
 on December 23, 1919, of the question of the Kazan, Simbirsk and Samara gubernia food commissars’ failure to carry out the order of the Food Commissariat concern -ing train consignments to Moscow by through trains. 
 The draftwas adopted by the Council with certain amendments. 
 p. 
 154 From the reports of speakers it transpired that one of the prin-cipal reasons for non -fulfilment of the order was the delay on the part of the Commissariat for Post and Telegraph in giving the Food Commissariat a direct line for communicating with the local areas. 
 This point was adopted by the Council in the following wording: “In all cases of non -receipt of a direct line the guilty party shall be that commissariat, which, not having received 175 176 177 178 179 180 181the line in the course of an hour for carrying out an important assignment, shall have failed to complain about it to the Chair -man of the C. 
P.

” ( Lenin Miscellany XXIV , p.

 p. 
 154 This point was adopted by the C. 
P.

 in the following wording: “The Commissariat for Justice is instructed to institute investigations to determine the culpability of the gubernia food commissars and other officials guilty of non -fulfilment of the Food Commissariat’s order for through trains with grain to be consigned to Moscow or of failure to fulfil same through bad organisation” ( Lenin Miscellany XXIV , p.

 155 On December 23, 1919, the Narrow Council of People’s Commissars examined the question of supplying the workers with clothes and footwear. 
 It decided to use for this purpose part of the stocks reserved for the Red Army, but in a manner that would not be detrimental to the army. 
 At the end of December the Central Army Supply Administration was to have issued to the Food Commissariat from army stores 30,000 pairs of leather boots, while the S. 
E. 
C. 
 undertook to deliver to the Food Commissariat every fortnight 20 per cent of all the boots manufactured in the country. 
 Apparently this decision of the Narrow Council met with objection on the part of the Presidium of the S.

 In view, however, of the general conditions prevailing in industry, a deduction should be made from this technically possible standard, but in no case more than 50 per cent, after which the actual standard of pro-ductivity, varying with the different trades, enterprises andgroups, shall be fixed.

 164 This draft was moved by Lenin at a meeting of the Council of People’s Commissars on February 5, 1920, in connection with L. 
 B. 
 Krasin’s report on the question of granting privileges to workers engaged on locomotive repairs and the production of spare parts for transport. 
 The following resolution was adopted on the report: “The S. 
E.

, the Commissariat for Food and the Commissariat for Railways are instructed to examine in detail the question of all privileges applying to workers engaged in locomotive repairs and the production of spare parts for transport, and to present a list of factories to the C.

” p. 
 166 The question of “ using the best workshops for repairs all /FL00634 hours of the day ” was discussed at a meeting of the C. 
P. 
C. 
 on March 16, 1920. 
 The question of intensive and uninterrupted work on the repair of locomotives was raised by Lenin in connection with the catastrophic state of railway transport, and this led to a number of other questions being discussed at the same Council meeting, namely: the possibility of placing an order abroad for locomo -tives and spare parts for repairing railway transport, and aninspection of factories and works engaged in the repair of goods train cars and engines. 
 p. 
 166 The Speech at the Fourth Conference of Gubernia Extraordinary Commissions was delivered by Lenin at the morning plenary session on February 6, 1920. 
 The conference was called at a timewhen the Soviet Republic, having defeated Kolchak, Denikin and Yudenich, had gained a temporary respite and was in a position to tackle its economic problems. 
 The conference was attended by 69 voting delegates and 7 delegates with a consultative voice. 
 All the delegates were Communists, the majority of the 69 voting delegates having joined the Party long before the revolution. 
 Most of the delegates were workers.

 166 Borotbists —members of a petty -bourgeois nationalist party, Borotba, formed in May 1918 after a split in the Ukrainian Social -ist-Revolutionary Party. 
 So called from the name of the Party’s central organ Borotba (Struggle). 
 In March 1919 assumed the name of Ukrainian Socialist -Revolutionary Party of Communist Borotbists, and in August that of the Ukrainian Communist Party of Borotbists. 
 Its leaders, among others, were V. 
 Blakitny, G. 
 Grinko and A. 
 Shumsky. 
 There were a good many counter -revolutionary followers of Petlyura in the ranks of the party,who, under cover of revolutionary phrases and declarations to the effect that they stood on the communist platform, came out against the dictatorship of the proletariat and pursued a policy aimed at splitting the united revolutionary front of the workingpostscript (see pp.

 For Lenin’s appraisal of the Borotba Party see pp. 
 180 -181 of this volume. 
 The Borotbists twice applied to the Executive of the Commu -nist International asking to be admitted to membership of theComintern and to be recognised as the main communist party in the Ukraine. 
 The Comintern passed a special decision on this question on February 26, 1920, proposing to the Borotbists that they dissolve their party and merge with the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Ukraine. 
 The resolution said that the Executive of the Communist International could only regard the desire to found a second parallel party as an attempt to split the ranks of the working people. 
 The growing influence of the Bolsheviks among the peasantry and the successes of the Soviet government in the Ukraine forced the Borotbists to decide on voluntary dissolution. 
 The Fourth Conference of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Ukraine, held March 17-23, 1920, agreed to admit the Borotbists into its ranks, all the newly enrolled members being reregistered. 
 Eventually, however, many Borotbists resumed their anti -Soviet activities and headed the struggle of the counter -revolutionary bourgeois -nationalist elements in the Ukraine.

 175 This interview was given by Lenin in the middle of February 1920 at a time when Soviet Russia, having gained a peaceful respite, was planning the country’s economic rehabilitation and reconstruction, and when the Soviet Government embarked on a broad programme for establishing diplomatic and commer -cial relations with the capitalist countries. 
 Lincoln Eyre of The World was sent to Russia to obtain an interview from Lenin, and was received by him in the company of cameraman Victor Kubes. 
 The interview was conducted in English, first in Lenin’s private office, then at his rooms in the Kremlin. 
 It lasted an hour and touched on questions of topical interest. 
 Lenin’s inter -view was published in The World and reprinted by many news -papers in Western Europe and America.

U. 
 In the resolution “On the PresentSituation and the Tasks of Our Party” Lenin marked off the following passage: “14. 
 Summing up the experience of the last year, the Twelfth Conference of the Bund finds: 1) that the Bund, in principle, had adopted the communist platform since the Eleventh Conference, 2) that the Programme of the Communist Party, which is also the programme of the Soviet government, corresponds with the fundamental platform of the Bund, 3) that a ‘united socialist front’ with principled opponents of Soviet power, who draw a line between the proletariat and its govern-ment, is impossible, 4) that the moment has come when the Bundcan relinquish its official oppositional stand and take upon itself responsibility for the Soviet government’s policy. 
” At the same time, the resolution on organisational questions stated that “ the logical consequence of the political stand adopted by the Bund is the latter’s entry into the R. 
C. 
P. 
 on the same basis as the Bund’s membership of the R. 
S. 
D. 
L.

” (underlined by Lenin). 
 The conference authorised the C. 
C. 
 of the Bund to see to it, as an essential condition, that the Bund preserve within the R. 
C. 
P. 
 the status of “an autonomous organisation of the Jewish proletariat” (marked off by Lenin). 
 On May 6, 1920, the Politbureau of the C.

, R. 
C. 
P. 
(B.

 192 This interview took place in Lenin’s private office in the Krem -lin on June 3, 1920. 
 Writing from Moscow, Nakahira reported: “I interviewed Mr. 
 Lenin at his office in the Kremlin. 
 Contrary to my expectation, the decoration of the room is very simple. 
 Mr. 
 Lenin’s manner is very simple and kind—as if he were greet -ing an old friend. 
 In spite of the fact that he holds the highestposition, there is not the slightest trace of condescension in his manner. 
” ( Osaka Asahi No. 
 13814 for June 13, 1920. 
) The next day, as Nakahira mentions in his later reminiscences, he brought the text of his interview to Lenin, who read it carefully and made several corrections. 
 Lenin’s interview given to another Japanese correspondent, K. 
 Fusse, and printed lower down, took place on June 3 or 4. 
 Possibly both correspondents were received by Lenin together. 
 Fusse says the interview lasted about twenty minutes. 
 A. 
 N. 
 Voz-nesensky, Chief of the Eastern Department of the People’s Com -missariat for Foreign Affairs, was present at the interview. 
 Fusse’s interview with Lenin was reported on June 26, 1920, in the Socialist -Revolutionary newspaper Volya published in Vladivostok. 
 The text of the interview given in this volume was first published in Russian in 1924 in the collection of articles Lenin i Vostok (Lenin and the East) and afterwards in the First Edition of Lenin’s Collected Works (Vol. 
 XX, Part II). 
 It was not included in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th (Russian) editions of the Collected Works . 
 p. 
 193 This refers to the Far-Eastern Republic set up in April 1920 on the territory of the Trans -Baikal, Amur, Maritime and Kam -chatka regions and Northern Sakhalin. 
 In form a bourgeois -democratic state, in essence it pursued a Soviet policy in keeping with the interests of Soviet Russia, which needed a prolonged respite on her Eastern Front and wanted to stave off war with 218 219 220Japan. 
 At the same time, the creation of a buffer state in the Far East was made necessary by force of circumstances. 
 As Lenin pointed out, “circumstances made necessary the creation of a buffer state, the Far -Eastern Republic. 
 We are well aware of the unbelievable sufferings that the Siberian peasants are enduring at the hands of the Japanese imperialists and the atrocities the Japanese have committed in Siberia” (present edition, Vol. 
 31, p. 
 465). 
 After the interventionists and whiteguards were driven out of the Soviet Far East (except Northern Sakhalin), the People’s Assembly of the Far -Eastern Republic voted for entry into the R.

R. 
 on November 14, 1922. 
 p. 
 193 The reference is to the French Socialist Party . 
 At the outbreak of the imperialist world war the Party’s reformist leadership adopted a social -chauvinist stand of open support of the imperialist war and participation in the bour -geois government. 
 There was a Centrist trend in the Party headedby Jean Longuet, which took a social-pacifist stand and pursued a policy of conciliation with the social -chauvinists. 
 There was also a Left, revolutionary wing in the Party which took an internationalist stand and was represented chiefly by its rank and file. 
 After the October Socialist Revolution a sharp struggle developed within the Party between the open reformists and Centrists on the one hand, and the Left, revolutionary wing, on the other—the latter strengthened by rank -and-file workers who joined the Party en masse. 
 At the Party’s congress in Tours in December 1920 the revolutionary wing received a majority. 
 The congress adopted a decision for the Party to join the Commu -nist International and founded the Communist Party of France. 
The majority of reformist and Centrists broke away from the Party and formed a separate party, retaining the old name of French Socialist Party. 
 p. 
 198 Lenin’s draft was adopted with slight amendments at a meeting of the Politbureau of the C.

 The commission wasvested with the powers of a Government and Party body and was sent to Turkestan to give all possible aid to the local Commu-nists and the working people of Turkestan in overcoming thatcountry’s political, economic and cultural backwardness, con-221solidating Soviet power and strengthening the union between the people of Turkestan and Soviet Russia. 
 One of the commis -sions tasks was to correct mistakes made during the implemen -tation of the national policy in Turkestan. 
 The Turkestan Commission carried out a number of measures for strengthening the local Party organisations and combating dominant -nation chauvinism and local nationalism. 
 Important issues were those concerning the principles of Turkestan auto -nomy, relations with the federal bodies, and the forms and methodsof Party organisation.

 198 The Second Congress of the Communist International , which laid the foundations of the Comintern’s programme, tactics and organ-isation was held from July 19 to August 7, 1920, in SovietRussia. 
 The opening session was held in Petrograd and the sub-sequent sessions, beginning with July 23, in Moscow. 
 The con -gress was attended by 169 voting delegates and 49 delegates with a consultative voice representing 67 workers’ organisations of 37 countries. 
 Apart from delegates representing the Commu -nist Parties and organisations of 31 countries, there were dele -gates from the Independent Social -Democratic Party of Ger -many, the socialist parties of Italy and France, Industrial Work -ers of the World (Australia, Britain and Ireland), the National Confederation of Labour of Spain and other organisations. 
 The R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
) was represented at the congress by 64 delegates. 
 All the preparatory work for convening the congress was directed by Lenin, who attached great importance to this inter -national congress of communist and workers’ organisations. 
An important role in defining the tasks and working out the political line of the Comintern was played by Lenin’s book “Left-Wing ” Communism —an Infantile Disorder , written for the opening of the Second Congress. 
 Lenin wrote the “Preliminary Draft Theses on the National and Colonial Questions (For the Second Congress of the Communist International)”, “Preliminary Draft Theses on the Agrarian Question (For the Second Congress of the Communist International)”, “Theses on the Fundamental Tasks of the Second Congress of the Communist International” and “The Terms of Admission into the Communist International” (see present edition, Vol. 
 31, pp. 
 144 -51, 152 -64, 184 -201, 206 -11). 
 The congress adopted the following agenda: 1) The Interna -tional Situation and the Fundamental Tasks of the CommunistInternational; 2) The Role and Composition of the Communist Parties Before and After the Conquest of Power by the Prole-tariat; 3) The Trade Unions and the Factory Committees;4) the Question of Parliamentarism; 5) The National and Colonial Questions; 6) The Agrarian Question; 7) The Attitude to the New “Centrist” Trends and Terms of Admission Into the Commu-nist International; 8) The Charter of the Communist Internation -al; 9) Organisational questions (legal and illegal organisa -tions, women’s organisations, etc. 
); 10) The Communist youthmovement; 11) Elections; 12) Miscellaneous. 
 222 223 224 225At the opening session of the congress Lenin delivered a report on the international situation and the fundamental tasks of the Communist International (see present edition, Vol. 
 31, pp. 
 215 -34). 
 Lenin took an active part in the work of most of the commit -tees—those on the national and colonial questions, on theagrarian question, on terms of admission into the Communist International, and on the international situation and the tasks of the Comintern. 
 Lenin also made a speech at the congress on the role of the Communist Party, delivered a report of the Committee on the National and Colonial Questions, speeches on the terms of admis-sion into the Communist International, on parliamentarianismand on affiliation to the British Labour Party (ibid. 
, pp. 
 235-63). 
 The congress adopted Lenin’s theses as a resolution, passed a resolution “On the Role of the Communist Party in the Prole -tarian Revolution”, in the formulation of which Lenin took anactive part, and adopted other resolutions, the “Terms of Admis-sion Into the Communist International” and the Charter of theComintern. 
 The congress also adopted the Manifesto of the Second Congress of the Communist International. 
 In addition it published a number of appeals: “The Third International to the Trade Unions of All Countries”, “To the Workers of Petrograd”, “To the Red Army and Red Navy of the R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
”, “Against the Executioners of Hungary”, “To the Proletarian Men and Women of All Countries”, and others. 
 The Second Congress of the Comintern played a tremendous role in the development of the international communist move-ment. 
 After the congress Lenin pointed out that “communismhas become central to the working-class movement as a whole” (see present edition, Vol. 
 32, p. 
 180).

 200 226 227The British Socialist Party was founded in 1911, in Manchester, as a result of the amalgamation of the Social -Democratic Party with other socialist groups. 
 Its small membership and its poor links with the masses gave the B. 
S. 
P. 
 a somewhat sectarian character. 
 During the First World War a sharp struggle devel -oped within the Party between the internationalists (WilliamGallacher, Albert Inkpin, John Maclean, Theodore Rothstein and others) and the social-chauvinists headed by Hyndman. 
 Within the internationalist trend there were inconsistent ele -ments who took a Centrist stand on a number of issues. 
 In Febru -ary 1916 a group of B. 
S. 
P. 
 leaders founded the newspaper The Call , which played an important part in uniting the interna -tionalists. 
 The annual conference of the B. 
S. 
P. 
, held in Salford in April 1916, condemned the social -chauvinist stand of Hyndman and his supporters, who then left the Party. 
 The British Socialist Party welcomed the Great October Socialist Revolution. 
 Its members played an important part in the “Hands off Russia” movement. 
 In 1919 the overwhelming majority of its organisations (98 against 4) declared for affil -iation to the Communist International. 
 The British SocialistParty, together with the Communist Unity Group, formed the core of the Communist Party of Great Britain. 
 At the First (Unity) Congress, held in 1920, the great majority of the B. 
S. 
P. 
 local organisations entered the Communist Party. 
 p. 
 200 The American Socialist Party was formed in July 1901 at a con-gress held in Indianapolis as a result of the amalgamation of groups that had broken away from the Socialist Workers’ Party and the Social -Democratic Party of the U. 
S. 
A. 
; one of the organ -isers of the latter was Eugene Debs, a popular figure in theU. 
S. 
 labour movement. 
 He was also one of the founders of the new party. 
 The party had a socially mixed membership made up of native-born and immigrant workers, as well as small farmers and people of petty -bourgeois origin. 
 The party’s Centrist and Right -wing opportunist leaders (Victor Berger, Morris Hillquit and others) denied the necessity of the proletarian dictatorship, renounced revolutionary methods of struggle, and reduced all party activities mainly to participation in election campaigns. 
 During the First World War (1914 -18) three trends appeared in the Socialist Party: the social -chauvinists, who supported the imperialist policy of the Administration; the Centrists, who opposed the imperialist war only in word; and the revolutionary minority, who took an internationalist stand and carried on a struggle against the war. 
 The Party’s Left wing, headed by Charles Ruthenberg, William Foster, William Heywood and others, relying on the proletarian elements, waged a struggle against the party’s opportunist lead -ership, for independent proletarian political action and theformation of industrial trade unions based on the principles of the class struggle. 
 In 1919 a split took place in the Socialist Party. 
 The breakaway Left wing founded the Communist Party of 228 229 230 231 232the U. 
S. 
A. 
, of which it formed the core. 
 The Socialist Party today is a small sectarian organisation. 
 p. 
 201 The Social -Democratic Party of Switzerland (known as the Swiss Socialist Party ) was formed in the seventies of the last century and was affiliated to the First International. 
 The party was re-formed in 1888. 
 The opportunists were very influential in the party, and during the First World War took a social -chauvinist stand. 
 In the autumn of 1916 the party’s Right wing broke away to form their own organisation. 
 The majority, headed by Robert Grimm, took a Centrist social -pacifist stand, while the Left wing took an internationalist stand. 
 The October Revolu -tion in Russia influenced and strengthened the Left wing, whichin December 1920 broke away and in 1921 joined the Communist Party of Switzerland.

 202 The conflict between the Petrograd United Consumers’ Com-mune and the Petrograd Soviet was this. 
 In the summer of 1920 a number of functionaries of the Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet headed by G. 
 Zinoviev and the Petrograd Trade Union Council raised the question of issuing bread rations to workers not only for actual work days but also for holidays and non-working days. 
 The Board of the Petrograd Commune (A. 
 Y. 
 Badayev and others) were opposed to this on the grounds that such an extra issue would violate the very principle on which the work ration was based and that, besides, the necessary supplies for this were lacking; in general, it might upset the regular issue of the work ration and shake the workers’ trust in the food supply system. 
 The Petrograd Soviet, however, ignored the opinion of the Petrograd Commune Board and announced the issue of rations for holidays. 
 Badayev refused to carry out this order and declared that the Board of the Petrograd Commune could not work under such conditions.

 12, 1920, and Gorky’s letter to H. 
 G. 
 Wells published in the same issue. 
 Both the article and the letter, though inspired by genuine affection for Lenin and admiration for his activities, were written from erroneous positions of the personality cult and contained a number of politically harmful theses. 
 Gorky gave extremely subjective and virtually idealist appraisals of the role of Lenin and the Russian people, and the nature of the revolution in Russia. 
 He overlooked the leading role of the Communist Party, the decisive role of the working class and the peasantry in the revo -lution. 
 Lenin’s motion was adopted by the Politbureau of the C. 
C. 
, R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
) on July 31, 1920. 
 The Communist International , organ of the Executive Committee of the Communist International, was published in Russian, German, French, English, Spanish and Chinese. 
 The first issue appeared on May 1, 1919. 
 The journal published theoretical articles and documents of the Comintern and a number of articles by Lenin (“The Third International and Its Place in History”, “The Tasks of the Third International”, “Ramsay MacDonald on the Third International”, “Greetings to Italian, French and German Communists”, “The Constituent Assembly Elections and the Dictatorship of the Proletariat”, “Notes of a Publicist” and others). 
 All member Parties of the Comintern were represented on the journal’s edi -torial board. 
 The journal dealt with the fundamental questionsof Marxist-Leninist theory bearing on the problems of the inter -national labour and communist movements and the experienceof socialist construction in the Soviet Union. 
 It also waged a struggle against various anti-Leninist tendencies. 
 Publication ceased in June 1943 following the decision by the Presidium of the Comintern’s Executive on May 15, 1943, dissolving the Communist International. 
 p. 
 205 The situation on the Polish and Wrangel fronts was discussed at a meeting of the Politbureau on August 19, 1920. 
 The Wrangel front was found to be the main front, and the Politbureau out -lined a number of measures aimed at strengthening it, speci -fically, it passed a decision to transfer the 6th Division of the First Mounted Army to the Wrangel front. 
 On August 20, 1920 the Commander -in-Chief forwarded a memo -randum to the Revolutionary Military Council of the Republicobjecting to this transfer on the grounds that the 6th Division formed the core of the First Mounted Army and in quality was equal to the three remaining divisions. 
 The memorandum bears J. 
 V. 
 Stalin’s superscription: “This information is incorrect : the remaining three divisions have no less than 10,000 sabres, and the 4th Cavalry Division remaining in the Mounted Army is older and more indigenous than the 6th”. 
 240 241 242On reading this memorandum Lenin wrote his proposals. 
 Lenin made the following notes, apparently during the dis -cussion of these proposals: under points 1 and 2 “Krestinskyagainst”, under point 4 “Krestinsky abstained”, and under point 5 “Krestinsky is for”. 
 The numeration of the points has been retained as given in the manuscript. 
 p. 
 205 This refers to Order No. 
 1847 dated August 20, 1920, of the Revo-lutionary Military Council of the Western Front, which stated that the Polish peace delegation consisted entirely of spies and secret service agents and that peace could only be concluded “on the ruins of White Poland”. 
 p. 
 206 On August 23, 1920, the Revolutionary Military Council of the Republic rescinded the order of the R. 
M. 
C. 
 of the Western Front and reprimanded the latter for their irregular action. 
 Simulta -neously K. 
 Danishevsky, head of the Soviet delegation conduct -ing negotiations with Poland, was directed, in the event of the Polish delegation not feeling satisfied with the explanation already given to the delegation at its meeting, to bring to the notice of this delegation the order of the Revolutionary Military Council of the Republic countermanding that of the R. 
M.

 of the Western Front.

 206 The Ninth All -Russia Conference of the R . 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
) held in Moscow from September 22 to 25, 1920, was attended by 241 delegates (116 of them voting delegates and 125 with a consultative voice) representing 700,000 Party members. 
 There were delegates from the gubernia organisations of the R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
 and the Ukraine, from the C. 
C. 
 of the Communist Parties of Azerbaijan and Arme -nia. 
 The Red Army was represented by 34 delegates. 
 The agendaconsisted of the following items: 1) Report by the delegate from the Polish Communists; 2) Political report of the C. 
C. 
; 3) Organisa-tional report of the C. 
C. 
; 4) The immediate tasks of Party develop -ment; 5) Report of the Party History Studies Committee; 6) Report on the Second Congress of the Communist International. 
 Lenin opened the conference with the Central Committee’s political report (see present edition, Vol. 
 31, pp. 
 275 -79), which dealt mainly with two questions—that of concluding peace with Poland and organising Wrangel’s defeat. 
 Lenin’s report was followed by heated debates, especially on the causes of the Soviet troops’ setback near Warsaw. 
 Wind -ing up the debate, Lenin pointed out that the speeches of thedelegates provided rich material for drawing necessary lessons and deductions. 
 The conference unanimously passed a resolution on the terms of peace with Poland, and approved the statement by the All-Russia Central Executive Committee concerning the specific peace terms drawn up under Lenin’s direction and edited by him (see Lenin Miscellany XXXVI , pp. 
 123 -26). 
 A highlight of the Ninth Conference was the discussion of the question of the immediate tasks of Party development. 
 The 243 244 245anti-Party group of “Democratic Centralism” put forward T. 
 V. 
 Sapronov as co -reporter to air their views on this question. 
 They came out against Party discipline and the Party’s guiding role in the Soviets and the trade unions. 
 The conference, like the Ninth Congress of the R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
), strongly rebuffed the “Democrat -ic Centralism” group. 
 The conference adopted a resolution on “The Immediate Tasks of Party Development” drafted and moved by Lenin (see pp. 
 212 -13 of this volume), who also wrote the “Proposals for the Resolution on the Immediate Tasks of Party Development” (see p. 
 214 of this volume). 
 The conference called attention to the need for drawing the rank -and-file Communists into wider active participation in the work of gubernia conferences and Gubernia Party Committee ple -nums. 
 Measures were outlined for eliminating red tape in the workof Government and economic bodies. 
 To combat various abuses and examine complaints received from Communists, the conference deemed it necessary to set up a Control Commission, and under the gubernia committees—special Party commissions. 
 On the C. 
C. 
’s organisational report the conference adopted a resolution to step up the work of the C. 
C. 
’s Secretariat with a view to achieving greater familiarity with local activities and a pooling of experience, and to pay more attention to the work of the Agitation and Propaganda Department; it also urged the necessity of improving the C. 
C. 
’s direct guidance of the organi-sational work of the Red Army and Navy Party organisationsand not allowing the work of these organisations to become detached from public life.

 She said that criticisers were sometimes offered to go “to nice torrid climes to eat peaches”.

—Polska Partia Socjalistyczna (The Polish Socialist Party)—a reformist nationalist party founded in 1892. 
 Through -out the party’s history Left -wing groups kept springing up within it as a result of pressure from the rank -and-file workers. 
 Some of these groups eventually joined the revolutionary wing of the Polish working -class movement. 
 In 1906 the party split up into the P. 
P. 
S. 
 Left wing and the Right, chauvinist wing (the so -called “revolutionary faction”). 
 Under the influence of the Bolshevik Party and the Social -Demo -cratic Party of Poland and Lithuania, the Left wing gradually adopted a consistent revolutionary stand. 
 During the First World War a large part of the P. 
P. 
S. 
 Left wing adopted an internationalist stand. 
 In December 1918 it united with the Social -Democratic Party of Poland and Lithuania to form the Communist Workers’ Party of Poland (as the Commu -nist Party of Poland was known up to 1925). 
 During the First World War the P. 
P. 
S. 
 Right wing continued the policy of national chauvinism, organising Polish legions on the territory of Galicia to fight on the side of Austro -German imperialism. 
 With the formation of the Polish bourgeois state the Right P. 
P. 
S. 
 in 1919 united with the P. 
P. 
S. 
 organisations on Polish territories formerly seized by Germany and Austria, and resumed the name of the P. 
P. 
S. 
 On becoming the ruling party, it helped transfer power to the Polish bourgeoisie, systematically carried on anti -communist propaganda, and supported a policy of aggression against the Soviet Union, a policy of conquest and oppression against Western Ukraine and Western Byelorussia. 
 Various groups in the P. 
P. 
S. 
 who disagreed with this policy joined the Communist Party of Poland. 
 After Pilsudski’s fascist coup (May 1926) the P. 
P. 
S. 
 was nomi -nally a parliamentary opposition, but actually it carried on noactive fight against the fascist regime, and continued its anti-communist and anti -Soviet propaganda. 
 During that period the Left -wing elements of the P. 
P. 
S. 
 collaborated with the Polish Communists and supported united front tactics in a number of campaigns. 
 During the Second World War the P. 
P. 
S. 
 again split up. 
 Its reactionary and chauvinist faction, which assumed the name Wolno 97, Równo 97, Niepodleg ^o97 (Liberty, Equality, Independ -ence), joined the reactionary Polish émigré “government” in London. 
 The Left faction, which called itself the Workers’ Party of Polish Socialists, under the influence of the Polish Workers’ Party, which was founded in 1942, joined the popular front against the Nazi invaders, fought for Poland’s liberation, and pursued a policy of friendly relations with the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
 In 1944, after the liberation of Poland’s eastern territories and the formation of a Polish Committee of National Liberation, the Workers’ Party of Polish Socialists resumed the name of P. 
P. 
S. 
 and together with the P. 
W. 
P. 
 participated in the building up of a people’s democratic Poland. 
 In December 1948 the P. 
W. 
P and the P. 
P. 
S. 
 amalgamated and formed the Polish United Workers’ Party.

 215 Lenin wrote this at a meeting of the Politbureau on October 9, 1920, when the question of drafting a resolution for the Prolet -cult congress was discussed. 
 Lenin’s rough draft contains themain theses of his draft resolution on proletarian culture written on the eve, October 8 (see present edition, Vol. 
 31, pp. 
 316-17). 
246 247 248Proletcult (Proletarian Culture)—a cultural and educational organisation which arose in September 1917 as an independent workers’ organisation. 
 Proletcult continued to uphold its “inde -pendence” after the October Revolution, thus setting itself in oppo -sition to the proletarian state. 
 It shunned the leadership of the Communist Party and insisted on keeping its bodies independent from the Soviet authorities, notably the People’s Commissariat for Education. 
 Its members virtually denied the cultural legacy of the past, shirked the tasks of cultural and educational work among the masses, and, by isolating themselves from life, aimed at creating a special “proletarian culture” by “laboratory methods”. 
 Bogdanov, Proletcult’s chief ideologist, paid lip -service to Marxism, but actually expounded subjective idealism, Machism. 
 Proletcult had a mixed membership. 
 In addition to bourgeois intellectuals, who held leading positions in many of its organi -sations, the membership included young workers who sincerelywished to promote cultural progress in the Soviet state. 
 The Communist Party came out strongly against the separat-ist tendencies of Proletcult. 
 In October 1920 Lenin raised thequestion of Proletcult before the Politbureau of the Central Committee. 
 Following the latter’s decision based on Lenin’s draft, the Chief Committee for Political Education drafted instruc-tions governing the relations between Proletcult and the Commis -sariat for Education. 
 These instructions were endorsed by the plenary meeting of the Central Committee on November 10, 1920. 
 In 1932 Proletcult ceased to exist.

 218 The Baku Congress of the Peoples of the East (the First Congress of the Peoples of the East) was held in Baku between September 1 and 7, 1920. 
 It was attended by 1,891 delegates representing 37 nationalities (of the Caucasus, Central Asia, Afghanistan, China, Egypt, India, Iran, Japan, Korea, Syria, Turkey and other countries). 
 Two -thirds of the delegates (1,273) were Com -munists. 
 The congress discussed the following questions: 1) The inter -national situation and the tasks of the working peoples of theEast; 2) the national and colonial question; 3) the agrarian question; 4) the Soviets in the East; 5) the organisational question and others. 
 Four sections were formed to prepare the material for the congress: the agrarian, the national and colonial, the Soviet activities, and the organisational sections. 
 The congress supported the decisions of the Second Congress of the Communist International and drew up a number of res -olutions based on these decisions. 
 To implement these decisionsthe congress organised a Council of Propaganda and Action of the Peoples of the East as a permanent body under the Executive Committee of the Comintern. 
 249 250 251 252 253Speaking of the Second Congress of the Communist Interna -tional and the First Congress of the Peoples of the East, Lenin pointed out: “These were international congresses which united the Communists and showed that in all civilised countries and in all the backward countries of the East, the banner of Bolshe -vism, the programme of Bolshevism, the line of Bolshevik actionare an emblem of salvation, an emblem of struggle to the work-ers of all civilised countries and the peasants of all the backwardcolonial countries. 
 They showed that, during the past three years, Soviet Russia not only beat off those who fell upon her in order to throttle her, but won the sympathy of the working people of the whole world...” (see present edition, Vol. 
 31, pp. 
 329-30).

 adopted on October 26, 1920, following a discussion of the question of estab -lishing contacts between the economic commissariats. 
 This question was raised in April 1920 at the Ninth Congress of the R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
), whose corresponding resolution read: “The Congress directs the C. 
C. 
 to devise in the immediate future a system of organisational connections between the Supreme Economic Council and other commissariats directly engaged in economic affairs (the commissariats for food, railways, and agriculture) in their everyday work with the aim of securing complete unity in the fulfilment of the economic plan approved by the Congress of the Party” ( The C .

 233 The question of reorganising the work of the People’s Commis -sariat for Education was raised by Lenin in November 1920 (see Collected Works , Fifth [Russian] Edition, Vol. 
 42, p. 
 376). 
 This reorganisation was necessitated by the fact that the activi -ties and structure of the Commissariat did not meet the newtasks in the field of public education arising from the transition to peaceful socialist construction. 
 In his letter to Lunacharsky dated November 29, 1920 Lenin set forth his preliminary views on this question (see Collected Works , Fifth [Russian] Edition, 277 278 279 280Vol.

 249 Curzon ’s Note was a result of the successes of the Red Army, which had ousted the White Polish invaders from the Ukraine and Byelorussia in the summer of 1920. 
 To hold up the advance of the Red Army and prevent a possible collapse of bourgeois Poland and defeat of Wrangel, the British Government sent a Note to Soviet Russia on July 11, 1920, signed by the British Foreign Secretary Lord Curzon. 
 The Note in the form of an ulti -matum demanded that the advance of the Red Army be stopped,that an armistice be concluded with Poland, and that the war with Wrangel should be terminated. 
 The British Government offered to act as mediator and on behalf of the Allies’ Supreme Council threatened, in the event of the ultimatum being rejected, to assist Poland “with all the means at its disposal”. 
 In its reply, based on Lenin’s proposals, the Soviet Govern-ment firmly rejected Curzon’s mediation and insisted on directnegotiations with Poland. 
 The Soviet Government protested against Britain’s attempt to annex the Crimea and agreed to guarantee the personal safety of Wrangel and his troops only on condition that they surrender immediately and completely.

 At the end of October an agreement was drafted under which the Syndicate was to receive a concession for a term of sixty years. 
 On the expiry of 35 years the Soviet Government was entitled to buy out all concession enterprises, and on the expiry of the agreed term the enterprises with their equipment in full running order were to be made over without compensation to the R.

 257 During the discussion of the draft resolution of the Eighth All -Russia Congress of Soviets “On Measures to Consolidate and Develop Peasant Farming” the Communist group at the congress declared for the elimination of the points concerning personal premiums for individual farmers. 
 On December 27, 1920, the C. 
C. 
 at a plenary meeting, examined this question, pointed out that the congress group had adopted an erroneous decision and sug -gested that it be revised. 
 The plenum adopted Lenin’s motiondefining the conditions and principles for rewarding individual farmers (see pp.

 They established a regime of terror and tyranny in the areas which they had seized, burning and razing to the ground villages and towns. 
 The working people of Armenia under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party and with the support of units of the 11th Army of Soviet troops quelled the revolt, liberated the capital of Armenia, Yerevan, on April 4, 1921 and drove out the Dashnaks.

 The meeting was called because some trade union functionaries vacillated on this subject, while A. 
 G. 
 Shlyapnikov and D. 
 B. 
 Ryazanov carried on demagogic propaganda against the idea of concessions. 
 Lenin made a report on this issue (see present edition, Vol. 
 32, pp. 
 300-15), argued against Shlyapnikov’s and Ryazanov’s statements in the debate, and made notes of the debate, which he used in his reply to the debate. 
 p. 
 285 This refers to the decision on “The Basic Principles of Concessions Agreements” passed by the C. 
P.

C. 
C. 
T. 
U. 
 (see present edition, Vol. 
 32, pp. 
 302 -13). 
 In saying that the C. 
P. 
C. 
 passed its decision “in spite of the motion by two very prominent trade unionists”, Lenin apparently had in view M. 
 P. 
 Tomsky and A. 
 Z. 
 Holtzmann. 
 p. 
 286 Lenin is referring to the draft of a concession agreement with the AB Svenska Kullager Fabriken in Göteborg (AB SKF).

P. 
 (Menshevik) committees of the Moscow organisation and the Central Region. 
 On April 2, 1918, it became the organ also of the Mensheviks’ Central Committee. 
 On May 10, 1918, by an order of the Vecheka the newspaper was closed down owing to its counter -revolutionary activities, and the men in charge were prosecuted. 
 The newspaper resumed publication on May 14 under the name Vsegda Vperyod! (Ever Forward!) The paper was closed own for good in February 1919 by decision of the All -Russia Central Executive Committee. 
 p. 
 290 Lenin is referring to the International Council of Trade Unions organised in July 1920 on the initiative of the Executive Com -mittee of the Communist International and the All -Russia Cen -tral Council of Trade Unions to serve as the centre of the world revolutionary trade union movement. 
 At the first international congress of trade unions held in July 1921 it was renamed the Red International of Trade Unions (the Profintern). 
 p. 
 293 This draft, with certain corrections in the wording, was adopted by the C. 
P. 
C. 
 on April 12, 1921. 
 This question was referred to the State Planning Commission for detailed examination, in which connection Lenin wrote two letters to G.

 This draft decision was endorsed by the C. 
L. 
D. 
 on April 15, 1921. 
 On April 29 the C. 
L. 
D. 
 passed a decision suspending construction of the pipeline in view of the fact that its remoteness entailed heavy expenditure on the delivery of materials, machinery and food, and on May 6 decided to switch the Alexandrov -Gai—Emba railway construction from accelerated to ordinary tempo. 
 p. 
 297 The draft decision was considered at a meeting of the C. 
P. 
C. 
 on April 26, and after the insertion of a number of addenda, was referred to the Narrow C.

 This draft was adopted by the Politbureau on May 22, 1921. 
 The congress group, on the motion of delegations from a number of industrial trade unions (the metalworkers, textile workers and miners) as well as delegations from the leading proletarian centres (Moscow, Petrograd and Ivanovo-Voznesensk), revised its decision and by a majority vote adopted as a basis the theses of V.

 307 Narodnaya Volya —a secret political organisation of Narodnik terrorists, came into being in August 1879. 
 While subscribing to views of the Narodnik utopian socialism, its members engaged in political struggle, and considered the most important goal to be the overthrow of the autocracy and the winning of political freedom. 
 They figured on achieving a reorganisation of society without the participation of the people, by means of individual terrorism. 
 “The Narodnaya Volya members,” wrote Lenin, “made a step forward when they took up the political struggle but they failed to connect it with socialism. 
” (see present edition, Vol. 
 8, p. 
 72). 
 The organisation was smashed up by the tsarist govern -ment after the assassination of Alexander II on March 1, 1881. 
 p. 
 307 The Peace Treaty of Versailles was drawn up at the Paris Con -ference in 1919 at the end of the imperialist world war of 1914 -18 between Germany and her adversaries—the U. 
S. 
A. 
, the British Empire, France, Italy, Japan and other Allied powers. 
 Describing this treaty in a speech on October 15, 1920, Lenin said, “It is an unparalleled and predatory peace, which has made slaves of tens of millions of people, including the most civilised” (see present edition, Vol. 
 31, p. 
 326). 
 The Versailles Peace Treaty was designed to perpetuate the repartition of the capitalist world in favour of the victor countries, and to establish a system of rela -tionships between countries aimed at strangling Soviet Russiaand suppressing the revolutionary movement throughout the world. 
 p. 
 308 This letter was written during the visit of I.

 308 The Tenth All-Russia Conference of the R . 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
) was held in Moscow from May 26 to 28, 1921. 
 It was attended by 239 delegates from Party and Soviet organisations. 
 It was a special con -ference. 
 The following questions were on the agenda: 1) economicpolicy: a) the tax in kind; b) co-operatives; c) financial reform; d) small industry; 2) the role of the Socialist -Revolutionaries and Mensheviks in the present situation; 3) the Third Congress 358 359 360 361 362 363of the Comintern; 4) information on the Fourth Trade Union Congress; 5) organisational question. 
 The highlight of the conference was the question of implement -ing the New Economic Policy, on which people in the localareas were not yet quite clear. 
 Lenin guided the work of the conference. 
 He delivered the opening speech, spoke on the agenda, made a report on the tax in kind and wound up the debate on this question, and took the floor many times during the discussion of the resolution “On Economic Policy”. 
 The conference heard supplementary infor-mation by Lenin to the main report on the work of the FourthTrade Union Congress. 
 Lenin also made a closing speech. 
 See present edition, Vol. 
 32, pp. 
 399 -437. 
 p. 
 309 Lenin is referring to the amendment to Point 1 of the draft reso -lution (see present edition, Vol. 
 32, p. 
 433). 
 The mover of this amendment proposed to add the words: “inasmuch as the condi -tions for a world revolution have not changed”. 
 This amendmentwas rejected by a majority vote. 
 p. 
 309 Lenin took the floor in connection with a proposed amendment to Point 3 of the draft resolution. 
 The end of this point read: “Anarchic commodity exchange (that is, exchange which eludes all control and state supervision) to be combated by concentra-tion of exchange chiefly in the hands of the co -operatives, without, however, any restrictions on regular free market operations. 
” The mover of the amendment proposed that the end of the sen -tence from the words “without, however” be replaced by thewords: “administration by mere injunction in the case of such exchange to be eliminated”. 
 The amendment was rejected. 
 p. 
 310 Lenin took the floor in connection with a proposed amendment to Point 5 of the draft resolution calling for an extension of the independence and initiative of each large establishment in the matter of disposing of financial and material resources. 
 The mover of the amendment proposed that this point should apply to the state farms as well. 
 The amendment was rejected. 
 p. 
 311 This refers to the amendment to Point 9 of the resolution pro-posing the following addendum: “special attention being paid to factual and material initiative and independence of the local areas”. 
 The amendment was rejected. 
 p. 
 311 This refers to the commission set up for drafting the Instructions of the Council of Labour and Defence to local Soviet bodies. 
 It was set up by the Council on May 20, 1921. 
 p. 
 312 This refers to the amendment to Point 10 of the draft resolution calling for the establishment of “special responsibility on the part of the central agencies for any hampering of local initiative and insufficient support of it” (see present edition, Vol. 
 32, 364 365 366 367 368p. 
 435). 
 The mover of the amendment proposed the following addendum: “stronger punitive measures to be taken against mis -management and misappropriation of state property and wastefuluse of labour. 
” The amendment was adopted to Point 6 of the resolution. 
 p. 
 312 Point 6 of the draft resolution concerned the regulation of workers’ wages. 
 p. 
 312 Lenin here took the floor in connection with Kiselyov’s proposal that a point be included in the resolution calling for the intro-duction of a system of collective testimonials (by up to 3 people)for persons handling state property, and listing the penalties incurred by the giver of such a testimonial. 
 The motion was rejected by a majority of votes. 
 p. 
 312 Lenin took the floor here in connection with the proposed amend-ment to Point 2 of the resolution (see present edition, Vol. 
 32 p. 
 433). 
 The mover of the amendment proposed that the reso -lution should state that the tax in kind is brought to the fore ineconomic activities. 
 The amendment was rejected. 
 p. 
 312 Lenin’s proposals were adopted at a meeting of the Politbureau on June 21, 1921, as directives for the Party Purge Commission. 
 They were included, with certain amendments, in the decision of the Politbureau of June 25 concerning the check-up, revision and purge of the Party. 
 In connection with the drafting of this decision Lenin jotted down notes concerning the conditions of admission to the Party (see Collected Works , Fifth [Russian] Edition, Vol. 
 43, p. 
 362). 
 Lenin’s remarks were also taken into consideration in the decision adopted by the Central Committee. 
 p. 
 315 The Third Congress of the Communist International was held in Moscow from June 22 to July 12, 1921. 
 It was attended by 605 delegates (291 voting delegates and 314 with a consultative voice) representing 103 organisations from 52 countries, namely: 48 Communist Parties, 8 Socialist Parties, 28 Youth Leagues 4 syndicalist organisations, 2 opposition Communist Parties (the Communist Workers’ Party of Germany and the Workers’ Communist Party of Spain) and 13 other organisations. 
 The 72 delegates from the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) were headed by Lenin. 
 The congress discussed the world economic crisis and the new tasks of the Communist International; the report on the activity of the Executive Committee of the Communist Inter -national; the Communist Workers’ Party of Germany; the Italianquestion; the tactics of the Communist International; the attitude of the Red International Council of Trade Unions to the Commu-nist International; the struggle against the AmsterdamInternational; the tactics of the R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
); the Communist International and the Communist youth movement; the women’s 369 370 371 372movement; the United Communist Party of Germany, and other questions. 
 All the work of preparing for the congress and conducting its activities was directed by Lenin. 
 He wrote the “Theses for a Report on the Tactics of the R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
)” which were adopted by the congress; he spoke on the Italian question; in defence of the tactics of the Communist International; delivered a report on the tactics of the R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
); took a leading part in drafting all the key resolutions; spoke in the committees and at the enlarged sittings of the Executive Committee of the Comintern and at the delegates’ meetings. 
 See present edition, Vol. 
 32, pp. 
 451 -96. 
 The “Theses on the Organisational Activities of the Communist Parties, on the Methods and Content of Their Work” for the Third Congress of the Communist International were drafted by O. 
 W. 
 Kuusinen. 
 On June 6, 1921, he sent Lenin part of the article he had written on the organisational question and the theses on which the article was based. 
 In accordance with Lenin’s remarks Kuusinen redrafted the theses and sent them again to Lenin on June 17 (without points 25 -29 dealing with the Party press); on June 21 the rest of the theses were sent (points 25 -29). 
 Apparently Lenin read this variant of the theses again. 
 On June 27 Kuusinen sent Lenin a third variant of the theses on the organisa -tional question revised on the basis of Lenin’s instructions. 
The theses were revised also with the co-operation of the German Communist Wilhelm Koenen. 
 On July 9 Lenin approved the theses and gave his final remarks and addenda to them. 
 (see pp. 
 318 -19 of this volume). 
 After discussion in the Committee the theses, with slight amendments, were adopted on July 12 by the Third Congress of the Communist International (see The Communist International in Documents .

 319 This document was written in connection with the drafting of the theses on tactics for the Third Congress of the Communist International. 
 The work of drafting the theses was entrusted to the Russian delegation to the congress. 
 373 374On June 1, 1921, K. 
 B. 
 Radek sent Lenin a draft of the theses containing amendments proposed by A. 
 Thalheimer and Béla Kun and their own draft. 
 On the envelope containing these materials Lenin jotted down his initial remarks on the draft theses on tactics (see Collected Works , Vol. 
 44, Fifth Russian Edition, p. 
 435) and then wrote out his remarks in full as printed lower down. 
 In accordance with Lenin’s directions the draft theses on tactics were revised, discussed at preliminary meetings with a number of delegations and tabled at the Third Congress in the name of the Russian delegation. 
 On July 1, Lenin delivered a speech at the congress in defence of the tactics of the Comintern (see present edition, Vol. 
 32, pp. 
 468 -77). 
 On July 12, the theses were unanimously adopted by the congress (see The Communist International in Documents , etc. 
 Moscow, 1933, pp. 
 180 -201). 
 p. 
 319 The Open Letter ( Offener Brief ) of the Central Committee of the United Communist Party of Germany to the Socialist Party of Germany, the Independent Social -Democratic Party of Ger -many, the Communist Workers’ Party of Germany and all tradeunions was published in Die Rote Fahne on January 8, 1921. 
 The U. 
C. 
P. 
G. 
 called on all workers, trade unions and socialist organisations to unite their forces in combating the growing reaction and the capitalists’ attack upon the working people’s vital rights. 
 Their programme of joint action included demands for higher pensions for disabled war veterans; elimination of unemployment; improvement of the country’s finances at the expense of the monopolies; introduction of factory committee control over all stocks of food, raw materials and fuel; restarting of all closed enterprises; control over sowing, harvesting and marketing of all farm produce by the Peasants’ Councils together with the agricultural labourers’ organisations; immediate dis-arming and disbanding of all bourgeois militarised organisations;establishment of workers’ self-defence; amnesty for all political prisoners; immediate resumption of trade and diplomatic rela -tions with Soviet Russia. 
 Lenin commented very favourably onthe Open Letter (see Lenin Miscellany XXXVI , p. 
 221). 
 The Right-wing leaders of the organisations to which the Open Letter was addressed rejected the proposal for joint action with the Communists, despite the fact that the workers came out for a united front of the proletariat. 
 p. 
 321 KAPD (Kommunistische Arbeiter Partei Deutschlands )—Commu -nist Workers’ Party of Germany, was formed in April 1920 by “Left” Communists, who had been expelled from the Communist Party of Germany at the Heidelberg Congress in 1919. 
 In Novem -ber 1920, in order to facilitate the unification of all Germancommunist forces and meet the wishes of the best proletarian elements within it, the C. 
W. 
P. 
G. 
 was temporarily admitted into the Comintern with the rights of a sympathising member. 
 The Executive Committee of the Comintern, however, still regarded 375 376the United Communist Party of Germany as the only fully -authorised section of the Comintern. 
 C. 
W. 
P. 
G. 
’s representatives were admitted into the Comintern on the condition that they merged with the United Communist Party of Germany and support -ed all its activities. 
 The Third Congress of the Comintern, inorder to win over the workers who still followed the lead of the C. 
W. 
P. 
G. 
, decided to give the latter two to three months to call a congress and settle the question of amalgamation. 
 The Execu-tive Committee, on behalf of the Third Congress, adopted anappeal “To the Members of the Communist Workers’ Party of Germany” setting forth the decision of the congress and urging the C. 
W. 
P. 
G. 
 to abandon its sectarian policy and unite with the U. 
C.

G. 
 The C. 
W. 
P. 
G. 
 leadership failed to comply with the decision of the Third Congress and continued their splitting activities: The Executive of the Comintern was compelled to break off relations with the party. 
 The C. 
W. 
P. 
G. 
 thus found itself outside the Communist International. 
 Eventually the C. 
W. 
P. 
G. 
 degenerated into a small sectarian group having no support among, and hostile to, the working class of Germany. 
 p. 
 321 The Italian question was referred to the Third Congress of the Comintern following the protest of the Italian Socialist Party against the decision of the Comintern’s Executive to exclude it from the Communist International and recognise the Communist Party of Italy as the only section of the Comintern in Italy. 
 The Third Congress of the Communist International adopted the following decision on thee I. 
S. 
P. 
 on June 29, 1921: “The Italian Socialist Party cannot belong to the Communist Interna-tional so long as the participants of the reformists’ conferenceat Reggio-Emilia and their supporters have not been expelled from the party. 
 “In the event of this preliminary condition being fulfilled the Third World Congress will authorise its Executive to take the necessary steps to bring about a union between the Italian Social -ist Party, after it has cleared its ranks of all reformist and Cen -trist elements, and the Communist Party of Italy, and transform both organisations into a unified section of the Communist Inter -national” ( The Communist International in Documents .

 1919 -193/FL0063. 
 Moscow, 1933, p. 
 164). 
 The Italian Socialist Party, however, failed to carry out this decision of the Third Congress. 
 A Left faction of “Third -Internationalists” (G. 
 M. 
 Serrati, F. 
 Maffi and others) was formed within the Italian Socialist Party in the spring of 1923, which was for amalgamation with the Communist Party of Italy. 
 In August 1924 the Third Interna -tionalists merged with the Communist Party of Italy. 
 p. 
 322 Lenin is apparently referring to the following text of the initial draft theses on the question of the tactics of the Communist 377 378 379 380 381International submitted by K. 
 B. 
 Radek: “Seeing that the Commu -nist International wishes to create only truly revolutionary mass parties, they [what Radek calls Centrist groups in the Commu -nist Parties of a number of countries. 
— Ed. 
] are making a big noise about the Comintern falling into sectarianism. 
 This is what the Levi group in Germany, the "meral group in Czechoslo -vakia, etc. 
, are doing. 
 The nature of these groups is quite clear. 
 They are Centrist groups, who cloak the policy of passive waiting for the revolution with communist phrases and theories. 
 The "meral group put off the organisation of a Communist Party in Czechoslovakia at a time when the majority of the Czechoslo -vak workers had taken a communist stand” (Central PartyArchives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.

 "meral’s report at the Inaugural Congress of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia was published in abridged form in the newspaper Vorwärts , around which were grouped the Czechoslo -vak Lefts headed by K. 
 Kreibich. 
 Lenin’s motion was adopted by the Tactics Committee. 
 The section of the theses on tactics dealing with the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia was worded in accordance with his proposal. 
 p. 
 324 At the beginning of July 1921 the employees of Berlin’s muni -cipal services decided to call a strike for higher pay. 
 The strike was decided on by a majority of the workers (about 80,000). 
 The reformists, however, succeeded in preventing the strike. 
 Following negotiations between the representatives of the employees and the Berlin Municipal Council, on which sat Social -Democrats, the employees’ pay was slightly raised. 
 p. 
 326 Early in July 1921 the cotton -mill workers of Lille (France) went on strike against wage cuts by the mill -owners. 
 The strike spread to a number of departments. 
 Early in September the workers of the Northern district of France declared a general strike. 
 Although the workers staunchly carried on the fight for two months, the strike failed as a result of the reformist tactics of the trade union leadership and unfavourable economic condi -tions.

 326 The draft decision on collective pay for employees of state institutions was discussed in the C. 
P. 
C. 
 on June 14, 21, 24 and 28 and July 8, 1921. 
 The system of collective supply was designed to replace that of individual supply by ration coupons and lists as well as bonuses paid in kind. 
 The workers and office employees received remuneration exclusively in the form of wages and salaries, the amount of which was fixed for each enterprise as 382 383 384 385a whole, i. 
e. 
, collectively for all the workers and office staffs. 
 On June 24 the C. 
P. 
C. 
 passed a decision adopting the system of collective pay for employees of state institutions in Moscow and Petrograd as from July 1 and in the remaining districts of the Republic not earlier than September 1, and set up a commission to complete “the draft in order to determine, on the basis of at least limited approximate data, what the number of Soviet employees will be after the reduction and what their pay is in money and in kind”. 
 On June 28, 1921, the C. 
P. 
C. 
, following reports by A. 
 B. 
 Khalatov and L. 
 I. 
 Ginsburg, passed its decision on collective pay for employees in state institutions with amend -ments to Point “A” proposed by Lenin and with his wording ofPoint “D”. 
 The final text of the Council’s decision was adopted on July 8, 1921. 
 p. 
 329 Lenin’s motion was made in connection with the decision of the Politbureau, adopted on the report of A. 
 S. 
 Kiselyov on July 7, 1921, “On Speeding Up the Transition of Enterprises and Insti-tutions to a Self -Supporting System of Operation”. 
 The decision stated: “Soviet institutions shall be directed to take more ener -getic steps towards switching over both separate enterprises andSoviet institutions to a self-supporting system of operation. 
” p. 
 329 In view of the famine that attacked the Volga region and south Ukraine in 1921, the Politbureau on July 9, 1921, passed a decision for the transfer of a maximum number of Communists to food supply work. 
 Lenin’s “ Notes ” were written apparently in preparation for the discussion of this question at the meeting of the Politbureau. 
 p. 
 330 The question of Centrosoyuz was discussed at a meeting of the C. 
P. 
C. 
 on July 15, 1921 which heard reports by L. 
 M. 
 Khinchuk “On the Organisation of Commodity Exchange and the Need for Speeding Up and Expanding Work in This Direction” and N. 
 P. 
 Bryukhanov “On Supervision Over Centrosoyuz in Pursuance of the Decision of the Council of People’s Commissars of June 14, 1921, With a View to Obtaining the Maximum Amount of Grain Through Commodity Exchange”. 
 A single resolution was adopted on both reports incorporating Lenin’s proposals. 
 p. 
 332 This motion was drafted in connection with the theses of the Siberian Bureau of the Central Committee of the R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
) and the Siberian Revolutionary Committee “On the Forms of Organisation of Siberian Soviet Institutions and Siberian Party Bodies”. 
 The theses put the case for the necessity of having in Siberia a regional Soviet centre with corresponding economic and military departments, an agency of the Vecheka and a regional Party centre. 
 Both these centres, in the view of the Siberian Bureau and Siberian Revolutionary Committee, were to be built on the principle of appointment. 
 386 387The covering memorandum stated that the question would be discussed at the forthcoming Fourth Siberian Regional Party Conference at which spokesmen of two trends were expected to state their views: one, which denied the need for Siberian regional centres, and the other, which recognised the need for their creation on the elective principle. 
 The theses of the Siberian Bureau were endorsed as a whole by the Orgbureau of the C. 
C. 
 on July 29, 1921. 
 Points 4 and 5 in the manuscript were crossed out by Lenin. 
 p. 
 332 The Central Committee plenum considered the question of the state of transport on August 8, 1921, and endorsed the conclu -sions of F. 
 E. 
 Dzerzhinsky with the amendments proposed byLenin. 
 Point 1 of the conclusions referred to the need for all Party and administrative bodies to devise measures for improving and assisting transport. 
 Points 2-4 called for reinforcement of the apparatus of the Com -missariat for Railways with top -level executives, the issue of a circular to all Gubernia Committees of the R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
) concern -ing the state of transport, and the organisation of a transportsubdepartment in the C. 
C. 
’s Organisation and Instruction Department to take charge of Party work on the railways. 
 Point 5 of the conclusions called for all transport servicing enterprises being turned over to the People’s Commissariat for Railways. 
 p. 
 333 The question of setting up an information bureau abroad to collect material on the international labour movement was discussed at the Presidium of the Executive Committee of the Comintern on August 17, 1921. 
 Lenin’s proposal was adopted. 
 Shortly afterwards E. 
 Varga sent Lenin his project for the “Organisation of Information in the Comintern Executive”. 
 This called for the establishment of an Information Institute which would supply the Comintern Executive with the necessary material. 
 The project suggested methods of work for the Insti-tute and outlined instructions for compiling socio -economic reports and political information. 
 On August 31, 1921, Lenin sent Varga his remarks on the project— “Tentative Amendments or Theses” (see pp. 
 337 -39 of this volume). 
 Lenin’s letter of September 1, 1921 (see p. 
 339 of this volume) was a reply to Varga’s letter dated August 31, 1921, on the subject of Lenin’s theses on the organisation of an Information Institute, in which Varga reported that there were “deep -going basic differences in regard to the aims of such an Institute”. 
 Trotsky, Zinoviev and Radek, wrote Varga, considered that this Institute was designed primarily to supply information for the internal use of the Comintern Executive. 
 “In your theses, on the other hand, the weight of emphasis seems to be on press information on the labour movement in Central Europe, whereas information for 388 389 390the Comintern Executive is relegated to the background. 
 This change of aim affects all other changes (legality, complete inde -pendence of the Comintern)”. 
 “Consequently, it would be neces -sary to decide in principle: is the aim of the Institute to be: a) information for the Comintern Executive? b) influencing the labour press by its publications? c) linking both aims? All questions of organisation depend, it seems to me, on the solution of this question” (Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism -Leninism of the C. 
C. 
, C. 
P. 
S. 
U. 
). 
 The plan for setting up an Information Institute did not materialise. 
 p. 
 336 This draft was written on the letter of I. 
 S. 
 Unschlicht, Deputy Chairman of the Vecheka, to the Central Committee of the R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
), which stated: “At the recent session of the All -Russia Central Executive Committee it was decided at the September sitting to hear the report of the commission set up to inspect the Commissariat for Foreign Trade. 
 Please give me your instruc -tions on the following: 1) should such a report be made at all;2) if it should, then in what direction” (Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C. 
C. 
, C. 
P. 
S. 
U. 
). 
 Lenin’s motion was adopted by the Politbureau at its meeting on August 25, 1921. 
 p. 
 336 This motion was written in connection with a telegram from the Chairman of the Siberian Revolutionary Committee I. 
 N. 
 Smir -nov dated August 26, 1921, reporting the arrest of Baron Ungern. 
The Politbureau adopted Lenin’s motion. 
 The trial of Baron Ungern took place on September 15. 
 During the hearing a long list of atrocities committed by Ungern and his underlings was revealed. 
 On capturing Urgu (now Ulan-Bator) he ordered all the employees of Centrosoyuz and theTown Council to be shot. 
 On his orders the peaceful inhabitants were robbed and killed and the town was burnt down. 
 The trial brought to light Baron Ungern’s ties with the Chinese militarists (Chang Tso-lin) and Japanese interventionists. 
 Baron Ungern was sentenced to death. 
 p. 
 336 E. 
 Varga’s project for the “Organisation of Information in the Comintern Executive” contained two appendixes: “Appendix A—Instructions on Compiling Socio -Economic Reports” and “Appendix B—Instructions on Compiling Reports on the Political Situation Within the Country”. 
 The instructions under Appendix A covered: 1. 
 The purpose of the reports, which was to give a dynamic picture of the development of the revolutionary movement in the country and its analysis. 
 2. 
 Four factors conditioning revolutionary development: a) the Communist Party—the motive force of the revolutionary movement; b) the proletariat—the revolutionary masses; c) the ruling classes—the enemy; 391 392d) the petty -bourgeois middle strata. 
 The report must show the alignment of forces. 
 3. 
 The starting -point should be an account of the economic situation, the social position of the proletariat and the middle strata. 
 4. 
 The report should consist of a brief review (5 -10 pages) with a detailed appendix to it. 
 The instructions under Appendix B contained the following sections: 1) Communist Parties; II) non -communist proletarian parties; III) bourgeois parties; IV) organisation of the armed forces. 
 Lenin refers to § § 3 and 4 of Section I (“Communist Parties”) of Varga’s instructions (Appendix B) which deal with legal and illegal Party cells, the promulgation of Party literature, appeals, pamphlets and books and the issue of illegal Party literature. 
 p. 
 338 Lenin’s motion was adopted by the Politbureau on September 2, 1921. 
 The next day, September 3, Lenin wrote to the Secre -tary of the Comintern Executive asking him to arrange for thecollection of information about workers’ donations in Europe for the relief of the famine-stricken areas in Russia (see Collected Works , Fifth [Russian] Edition, Vol. 
 53, Document 270). 
 For Soviet press reports on moneys collected among the interna -tional proletariat see Document 345 of the same volume. 
 p. 
 340 Under the pretence of rendering relief to the famine -stricken areas in Russia the imperialists organised an “International Com -mission” headed by Noulens, the former French Ambassador toRussia and one of the chief organisers of counter-revolutionary plots and military intervention against Soviet Russia. 
 The com -mission was made up of former French, English, and Belgian diplo -mats and big foreign owners of enterprises that had been nation -alised in Russia. 
 On September 4, 1921, the Noulens Commissionsent a telegram to the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs demanding that thirty experts be admitted into Soviet Russia for on-the-spot investigations under a special programme pro -viding for the collection of information of an intelligence nature. 
 On September 6 the Politbureau approved, with slight amend -ments, the text of a Note to Noulens drafted in accordance withLenin’s proposals. 
 The answering Note of the Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, published in Izvestia on September 8, stated that “Mr. 
 Noulens’ Commission, in lieu of relief for the famine-stricken areas, planned to collect information on the internal position of Soviet Russia ... and this was to be done under the guidance of people who had already engaged in such a study with the undisguised aim of engineering revolts and facilitating the advance of foreign armies on the territory of the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
 ” (U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
 Foreign Policy Documents , Vol. 
 IV, Moscow, 1960). 
 The Soviet Government emphatically refused to permit entry of the Noulens Commission into the Soviet Republic. 
 p. 
 341 393 394 395 396 397Owing to food difficulties, the crop failure and the need for ren -dering relief to the famine -stricken areas, the Politbureau on Sep -tember 6, 1921, adopted a decision on directives to the Food Commissariat with Lenin’s amendments. 
 The directives provided for a reduction in the number of recipients of state food supplies as from October 1921, and the establishment of a grain fund. 
 p. 
 341 The motion concerning spendings from the gold fund was adopted by the Politbureau on September 14, 1921. 
 p. 
 342 Lenin’s motion was adopted by the Politbureau on September 13, 1921. 
 Point 4 was crossed out by Lenin and not included in the decision of the Politbureau. 
 The question of book sales was re -examined by the Politbureau at its meeting on October 15, at which it confirmed its decision of September 13 and outlined concrete practical measures for its implementation; special attention was given to measures for preventing all kinds of anti -Soviet literature from getting into the book trade. 
 p. 
 342 This motion was adopted by the Politbureau on September 14, 1921. 
 p. 
 343 The Party purge was carried out in compliance with the resolu -tion of the Tenth Congress of the R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
) “On Problems of Party Development”. 
 It was preceded by long and careful pre -paration. 
 On June 21, 1921, the Central Committee and theCentral Control Commission adopted a Decision on Checking, Revising and Purging the Party (see Pravda No. 
 146 for June 30, 1921), which fixed the date for the purge to be carried out (from August 1 to October 1, 1921), stipulated that working people, both Communists and non-Party, were to be questioned concern -ing members of the Party who were being checked, and definedthe procedure for setting up local verification commissions. 
 During the period of the purge admission into the Party was suspended, an exception being made in the case of workers and peasants who did not exploit outside labour. 
 On July 7 the Politbureau endorsed a Central Verification Commission for checking the Party membership and local verification commissions. 
 The Central Committee of the Party addressed a letter “To All Party Organisations. 
 On the Purging of the Party” (see Pravda No. 
 163 for July 27, 1921) setting forth the aims and methods of the purge. 
 The C. 
C. 
 recommended the following guidelines: a more indulgent attitude towards workers in the matter of pre-senting documents, testimonials, etc. 
 As regards peasants, a clearline should be drawn between kulak and proprietary elements and honest working peasants. 
 A stricter approach to “commis-sarified” elements, to those holding posts which involve any priv -ileges. 
 An especially strict check to be applied to former govern -ment officials and bourgeois intellectuals. 
 And strictest of allto former members of other parties, particularly the Mensheviks 398 399and Socialist -Revolutionaries. 
 The start of the purge was put off until August 15. 
 As a result of the purge, which continued up till the Eleventh Congress of the R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
) about 25 per cent of the membership were expelled from the Party. 
 This improved the Party’s social composition, strengthened discipline, gave the Party greater prestige among the non -Party worker and peasant masses and freed the Party from elements who discredited it. 
 The Party’s -ideological and organisational unity was enhanced. 
 p. 
 343 This directive of Lenin’s was incorporated in the C. 
C. 
’s decisions. 
 The “Report of the Central Committee of the R. 
C. 
P. 
” for Sep -tember 1921 states that the C. 
C. 
 passed two decisions concerningthe procedure for recommending members of the R. 
C. 
P. 
 during the purge. 
 One stated: “Only those comrades have the right to recommend who have known the recommended person not less than one year and have worked with him or observed his work in one or another Party organisation”. 
 The other decision spoke about the responsibility of the recommenders for the recommended (see Izvestia of the C . 
C. 
, R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
) No. 
 35, Decem-ber 1, 1921). 
 p. 
 344 In 1921 various groups of American workers united around the Society for Technical Aid to Soviet Russia expressed a desire to go to Soviet Russia to lend a hand in economic construction. 
 Most of these workers were Russian emigrants who had gone to America before the October Revolution. 
 On June 22, 1921, the Council of Labour and Defence discussed the question of enlisting the services of members of the indus -trial emigrant community, and recognised the desirability of“developing individual industrial enterprises or groups of enter-prises by handing them over to groups of American workers andindustrially developed farmers on a contract basis ensuring them a definite degree of economic autonomy” ( Lenin Miscellany XX, p. 
 202). 
 The Council also considered it necessary to regulate industrial immigration of workers from foreign countries. 
 On August 11, 1921, a telegram signed by Lenin was sent to the Society for Technical Aid to Soviet Russia, stating, among other things: “You must bear in mind the hardships existing in Russia, the difficulties in connection with the food supply problem, and other obstacles which would have to be faced. 
 Persons going to Russia should be prepared to meet these conditions .... 
 It w ould be best to send delegates first for an on-the-spot inspection of settlement land lots, wood lots, mines, factories, etc. 
 to be leased” (U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
 Foreign Policy Documents , Vol. 
 IV, Moscow, 1960, p. 
 261). 
 In the latter part of 1921 a group of American workers headed by S. 
 Rutgers, a Dutch engineer and Communist, W. 
 D. 
 Hey -wood, a prominent leader of the American labour movementand G. 
 S. 
 Calvert, an American worker, carried on negotiations with the Soviet Government for exploitation by this group of 400 401 402 403 404a part of the Kuznetsk coal -field in Siberia and the organisation there of an industrial colony. 
 Lenin received delegates of the American workers’ colony on September 19 and had a talk with them. 
 A record of this talk, made by Lenin, is given in Lenin Miscellany XXIII , p. 
 39. 
 Lenin’s draft engagement was written in connection with this talk. 
 For details concerning the agree -ment with the sponsor group of the American workers (Rutgersgroup) see pp. 
 348-50 of this volume. 
 p. 
 344 In a letter to the Politbureau dated October 7, 1921, G. 
 V. 
 Chicherin, People’s Commissar for Foreign Affairs, wrote that the Government of the Far -Eastern Republic wished to be briefed by the Politbureau on the following points: 1) Is recognition of the F. 
 -E. 
R. 
 by Japan and America desirable in the absence of simultaneous recognition by them of the R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
; 2) Should the offer by foreigners to grant state loans to the F. 
 -E. 
R. 
 be accepted; 3) Is the F. 
 -E. 
R. 
 independent of the R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
 in fact as well as in form. 
 In the opinion of the Commissariat for Foreign Affairs these questions were to be answered in the following manner: 1) Recognition of the F. 
 -E. 
R. 
 is desirable, but without the structure of the F. 
 -E. 
R. 
 being specified in the agreement; 2) Foreign loans are useful provided the sovereign rights of the F. 
 -E. 
R. 
 are preserved; 3) The F. 
 -E. 
R. 
 is to be considered independent of the R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
 only in form. 
 Lenin’s motion was adopted by the Politbureau on October 8, 1921. 
 The draft directives to the F. 
 -E. 
R. 
 proposed by Chicherin were endorsed by the Politbureau on October 10, 1921. 
 p. 
 345 Lenin’s proposal was included in the decision of the C. 
C. 
 plenum on October 8, 1921, passed in connection with Molotov’s report concerning the registration of executives and the order in which they were to be distributed.

 347 This draft was written in preparation for the meeting of the Politbureau on the question of an agreement with the group of American workers and engineers headed by S. 
 Rutgers, who had arrived in Russia (see Note 399). 
 On September 23, 1921, the C. 
L. 
D. 
 discussed the proposal of the Rutgers group for the Nadezhdinsk Works and a number of enterprises of the Kuznetsk coal -field to be turned over to them for exploitation, and found it desirable to conclude an agreement, the final terms of which were to be drafted by a commission con -sisting of representatives of the S. 
E. 
C. 
, the Commissariat forLabour and the Commissariat for Agriculture. 
 Lenin took part in the negotiations with the Rutgers group and made a number of proposals in connection with the terms of the agreement (see pp. 
 348-50, 352 -53 of this volume, and Collected Works , Vol. 
 53, Fifth Russian Edition, pp. 
 260 -61, 302 -03). 
 The agreement with the sponsor group (the Rutgers group) of the American workers, which was signed on October 20, was endorsed by the C. 
L. 
D. 
 on October 21 and by the C. 
P. 
C. 
 on October 25. 
 In November the Soviet Government signed a con -tract with this group, under which the American workers wereto bring with them a definite quantity of tools, materials andfoodstuffs, while the Soviet Government assigned a sum of $300,000 for the purchase abroad of machines and equipment. 
 Under the terms of this contract an Autonomous Industrial Colony directly subordinated to the C. 
L. 
D. 
 was set up in part of the territory of the Kuznetsk coal -field. 
 p. 
 348 Lenin’s proposals formed the basis of the Politbureau’s decision of October 15, 1921, concerning the proposals of S. 
 Rutgers, and the Council of Labour and Defence decision of October 17, 1921, “On the Terms of an Agreement with the Rutgers Group”. 
 p. 
 350 Lenin’s draft was adopted at the meeting of the Politbureau on October 14, 1921. 
 After hearing the opinion of the Central Control Commission and the Central Verification Commission on the question of assigning Shlyapnikov to food supply work, the Politbureau ruled on October 27: “The period of Comrade Shlyapnikov’s work on food supply should be fixed at two months, counting from the date of his departure” (Central Party Archives Institute of Marxism -Leninism of the C. 
C. 
 of the C. 
P. 
S. 
U.

 The Central Verification Commission , consisting of five members, was set up for the period of the Party purge to direct the work of the local verification commissions (see Pravda No. 
 146, June 30, 1921). 
 p. 
 350 There having been certain differences of opinion among leading members of the Baku Party organisation and the central organi -409 410 411sations of Azerbaijan in applying the national policy, the Central Committee of the R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
) issued instructions for the greatest discretion to be shown by Party workers in Azerbaijan towards the mode of life and way of thinking among the Moslem popula -tion. 
 All functionaries of the Azerbaijan Communist Party weredirected to take this into consideration in all their activities and strive towards teamwork and co-operation and not allow any factions to be formed within the Party organisation. 
 Lenin’s proposals were included in the decision of the C. 
C. 
’s Politbureau adopted October 15, 1921. 
 The directives on the implementation of the Communist Party’s national policy in Azerbaijan drafted by J. 
 V. 
 Stalin were endorsed by the Politbureau on October 17. 
 Point 6 refers to the decision of the Politbureau of October 3, 1921, aimed at preventing any violation by Baku Party workers of the Soviet Government’s policy towards Persia (Iran).

 352 The A. 
R. 
A. 
 (American Relief Administration )—was formed in 1919 to render relief to the population who had suffered from the First World War. 
 The President of the A. 
R. 
A. 
 was Herbert Hoover, a big capitalist, who had had close links with Russian capital before 1917. 
 Some of the A. 
R. 
A. 
 staff engaged in charitable work with all sincerity and conscientiousness, but the A. 
R. 
A. 
 as a whole served as an instrument for spreading the influence of American imperialism and dumping old stocks. 
 On October 18, 1921, the draft of an agreement with the A. 
R. 
A on the organisation of food parcels to Russia was circulated for voting among members of the Politbureau. 
 The covering letter has the signatures of Politbureau members and a proposal by Stalin that a charge be made for transportation of the parcels from the frontier to the distributing warehouses, and for their storage, since, in his opinion, this was a commercial operation, not charity. 
 Lenin’s bracketed remark was made in connection with this proposal. 
 The draft agreement with the A. 
R. 
A. 
 was endorsed by the Politbureau on October 19, 1921. 
 The Soviet Government accepted A. 
R. 
A. 
 assistance in con -nection with famine on the Volga and in south Ukraine in 1921but repelled its attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of the Soviet Republic and established control over its activities. 
 As subsequent events proved, the A.

 The Metal Department of the Supreme Economic Council, which had been charged with the manufacture of these ploughs in May 1920, drew up a production plan without taking into account available metal and fuel resources. 
 The Special Three -Man Commission set up to combine all production of ploughs did not inform the C. 
L. 
D. 
 or the C. 
P. 
C. 
 as to the actual state of affairs. 
 This draft decision was adopted at the meeting of the C.

 on October 21, 1921. 
 The case of red tape was brought before the Moscow Military Tribunal, which found a number of mem -bers of the staffs of the S. 
E. 
C. 
 and the Commissariat for Agri -culture guilty of negligence. 
 Considering these men’s servicesin the matter of economic reconstruction, however, the Tribunal decided not to punish them. 
 At the suggestion of the Moscow Military Tribunal the C. 
L. 
D. 
 reprimanded the Presidium of the S. 
E. 
C. 
 and the Board of the Commissariat for Agriculture for giving insufficient attention to the production of Fowler ploughs.

 When reports started coming in from the local areas, Lenin raised the question of studying and utilising these reports.

 “Vladimir Ilyich showed a great interest in the results of our commission’s work. 
 On his advice and suggestion a draft decision was drawn up, which was en -dorsed by the Council of Labour and Defence on November 21,1921. 
 This decision took into account all Lenin’s remarks. 
 He attached special importance to having people appointed in the various commissariats and other institutions who were really interested in and understood the importance of studying the local reports” ( Vospominaniya o Vladimire Ilyiche Lenine [Remi-niscences of Lenin], Part 3, Moscow, 1961, p.

 He lent an attentive ear to our stories, showed a lively interest in the most varied aspects of life in people’s Mongolia, and gave some useful advice. 
 In particular, he drew our attention to the need for raising the level of education and culture among the Mongolian people, while at the same time stressing the need for developing the country’s economy to the utmost with a view to meeting all the requirements of the people.

 360 The First All-Russia Conference on Trade Union Cultural and Educational Work was held in Moscow from September 26 to October 1, 1921. 
 It was attended by 173 delegates (122 voting delegates and 51 with a consultative voice), of whom 119 were Communists, 51 non -Party people, 1 Menshevik, 1 Socialist -Revolutionary and 1 inter -party socialist. 
 There were 13 items on the agenda of the conference, which included reports of the A. 
C. 
C. 
T. 
U. 
’s Culture Department, the Peoples’ Commissariat for Education and its chief administrations, and Proletcult; reports from the local areas (Donbas, Petrograd, Baku); the New Economic Policy and education; the trade union’s work of polit -ical education; cultural work among the youth, and otheritems. 
 The conference mapped out ways for improving the trade unions’ work of political education, and new forms and methods under the New Economic Policy (cultural work at private and leased enterprises, and so on). 
 The conference adopted a wrong stand on the question of rela-tions with the Chief Committee for Political Education. 
 Itsresolution (“Role and Aims of the Trade Unions’ Cultural Work”) contained a demand that the trade unions’ cultural work should be freed from the influence of the Chief Committee for Political Education. 
 This ran counter to the resolution of the Tenth Con-gress of the R.

 “The trade unions,” ran this resolution, “constantly lapse into the entirely erroneous view that educational work in all forms should be the business of the trade unions, that the trade unions would be better able to con-duct the business of education than the educational authorities. 
 “Their point of view is erroneous and stems from misinter -pretation of the tasks of the trade unions. 
 Adherence to sucha point of view would induce the conclusion that all state func-tions, the work of all the commissariats, should be turned overto the trade unions” ( Second All-Russia Congress of Political Education Departments .

 Excuse me, Comrades, but a beard means a lot to a peasant. 
 It stands for his way of life, his thinking, and the best example is the peasant Petrushkin sitting here next to me. 
 If Comrade Lenin says, ‘I’ll go and burn all the prayer-books’, I’d like to know the opinion of a non -Party man, and I’ll ask Petrushkin what the peasants will think of my wanting to burn the prayer -books. 
 He ’ll say, ‘Who cares, let them burn ’. 
 He’s a young man, but if I ask a bearded man he’ll say we ought to wait a bit. 
 This means a lot to us” ( Istorichesky Arkhiv [Historical Archives], No.

C. 
P. 
, appointed a special commission to investigate the causes of the suicide of V. 
 V. 
 Oldenborger, Chief Engineer of the Mos-cow Municipal Waterworks. 
 The Commission found that thedeceased was not only a highly skilled employee, but a man utterly devoted to his work. 
 The cause of suicide were the dif-ficult conditions, which interfered with the daily routine of Olden -borger’s work. 
 Some of the members of the Waterworks Special Trio, instead of trying to improve things at Moscow’s Water -works, made them more difficult and complicated than ever;Engineer Semyonov, Chief Inspector of the People’s Commis-sariat for Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection, who is a member ofthis Trio, was rude, cavilling and bureaucratic in his relations with Oldenborger; Makarov-Zemlyansky, Chief Inspector of the same commissariat and a former clerk at the Waterworks, carried on a ceaseless persecution of Oldenborger; and Yelagin and Merkulov, workers of the Alexeyevsk Pump -House, accused Oldenborger groundlessly of technical disorganisation of the Waterworks and of an attitude of disrespect towards the commu -nist group on the part of the employees. 
 All this was bound tohave its effect on the emotional state of the deceased. 
 The commis-sion considers the continued employment of Makarov -Zemlyansky impermissible not only in the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspec -tion, but in Soviet service generally, as being a person who isalien to the spirit of Soviet service, an intrigant who has earned among the employees of the Waterworks the reputation of being a dishonest man. 
 The commission also found that engineer Semyo-nov of the W. 
P. 
I. 
 should not be allowed to continue work at theWorkers’ and Peasants’ Inspection or to have anything to do with the Moscow Municipal Waterworks, and likewise considers it necessary that Yelagin and Merkulov should be dismissed from the Waterworks and transferred to some other enterprise.

 In a conversation, with A. 
 V. 
 Lunacharsky in February 1922 Lenin “once more stressed the necessity of establishing a definite proportion between entertainment films and scientific films”. 
 Vladimir Ilyich, Lunacharsky writes in his reminiscences, said that the production of new films imbued with communist ideas and reflecting Soviet realities should be started with newsreel, 447 448 449since, in his opinion, the time had not yet come for the production of such films. 
 “If you have a good newsreel, serious and enlightening pictures, it doesn’t really matter if you show some worthless film with them of a more or less usual type to attract the public. 
 A censorship, of course, will be needed. 
 Counter -revolutionary and immoral films should be barred. 
” To this Lenin added: “As you find your feet, what with proper handling of the business, and receive certain loans to carry on, depending on the general improvement in the country’s position, you will have to expand production, and particularly make headway with useful films among the masses in the cities, and still more in the countryside .... 
 You must remember always that of all the arts the most im -portant for us is the cinema” ( Sovietskoye Kino No. 
 1 -2, 1933, p. 
 10). 
 p. 
 389 Lenin’s proposal on Kalinin’s trip to the Ukraine was adopted by the Politbureau on January 28. 
 Kalinin made the trip on February 7 -18 and March 5 -18, 1922, with the agittrain “October Revolution” along the route: Poltava—Mirgorod—Kiev—Belaya Tserkov—Kremenchug—Odessa—Zhmerinka—Kamenets Podolsk— Vinnitsa—Berdichev—Zhitomir. 
 p. 
 389 This refers to an article entitled “The Ninth Congress of Soviets and the Peasantry” published in Pravda on January 27, 1922, over the signature Bespartiiny (Non -Party -Man). 
 The writer propounded a plan for popularising among the peasantry the decisions of the Ninth All -Russia Congress of Soviets on peasant questions. 
 Lenin’s motion was adopted by the Politbureau on January 28, 1922. 
 p. 
 390 The idea of an international conference to deal with all questions concerning the establishment of peace and economic co -operation in Europe, and also the question of Russian debts, was put forward by the Soviet Government, who addressed Notes to this effect to Britain, France, Japan, Italy, and the U. 
S. 
A. 
 (see Collected Works , Fifth Russian Edition, Vol. 
 44, pp. 
 185 -88). 
 The decision to convene an international economic and financial conference was taken by the Supreme Allied Council at a conference in Cannes on January 6, 1922. 
 The Allies invited Soviet Russia to the conference in the hope of forcing from her a number of political and economic concessions while at the same time establishing economic relations with her. 
 The Soviet delegation to the Genoa Conference was elected at an emergency session of the All -Russia Central Executive Committee on January 27. 
 Lenin was appointed head of the delega -tion with Chicherin as his deputy “vested with all the rights aschairman in the event of circumstances preventing Comrade Lenin from attending the conference”. 
 Among the other members of the delegation were L. 
 B. 
 Krasin, M. 
 M. 
 Litvinov, N. 
 N. 
 Nari-manov, V. 
 V. 
 Vorovsky and Y. 
 E. 
 Rudzutak. 
 The question ofLenin going to Genoa was widely discussed by the people of the Soviet Republics. 
 Numerous letters were received expressing 450 451apprehension for his life and safety and declaring against his going to the conference. 
 The Central Committee of the R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
) passed a special decision on this question, under which Lenin resigned his commission to Chicherin as head of the delegation. 
 Lenin directed the work of the delegation, drew up the C. 
C. 
’s directives for it, and other important documents bearing on Soviet Russia’s participation in the Genoa Conference (see pp. 
 394 -95, 396 -98, 401 -04, 410 of this volume, and volumes 44 and 45 of the Fifth Russian Edition). 
 The Genoa Conference sat from April 10 to May 19, 1922. 
 It was attended by representatives from 29 countries. 
 The declara -tion by the Soviet delegation, which was approved by Leninand endorsed by the Council of People’s Commissars, stated: “While remaining true to the principles of communism, the Russian delegation recognises that in the present epoch, which makes the parallel existence of the old and the emergent new social system possible, economic co-operation between states repre -senting the two systems of property is imperatively necessaryfor universal economic reconstruction” ( Materialy Genuezskoi konferentsii . 
 [Materials of the Genoa Conference. 
] Verbatim Report. 
 Moscow, 1922, p. 
 78). 
 The Genoa Conference failed to settle the problems confront-ing it. 
 The Soviet delegation vigorously repelled the attemptsof the imperialist powers to impose a colonial status upon Soviet Russia (the establishment of control over Soviet finances, etc. 
). 
 By proposing talks on a general reduction of armaments and the banning of the most barbarous methods of warfare (poison gases, military aircraft), the Soviet delegation demonstrated to the world the peace-loving nature of Soviet Russia’s Leninist foreign policy. 
 p. 
 390 Lenin here alludes to the policy of partial concessions which the British Government of Lloyd George carried out in the early twenties in order to suppress the revolutionary movement for national liberation in Ireland and Egypt. 
 The Anglo -Irish Treaty was signed on December 6, 1920, following a long and hard struggle for national independence by the Irish people. 
 The Treaty provided for the establishment of a dominion “Irish Free State” within the British Empire. 
 Six north -eastern counties (Ulster), the most industrially developed part of Ireland, were alienated to Great Britain. 
 After crushing the rebellion of the Egyptian people against British rule in December 1921, the British Government was compelled in February 1922 to terminate its protectorate and proclaim Egypt an “independent kingdom”. 
 Egypt, however, became only nominally “independent”, since all her territory remained occupied by Britain, who controlled the Suez Canal zone, ruled Anglo -Egyptian Sudan, etc. 
 p. 
 393 The reference is to the forthcoming conference of the three Inter -nationals (the II, II 2 and III Communist International). 
 The 452 453Communist International’s active fight for the creation of a united workers’ front against the onset of the bourgeoisie and the leaning towards unity of action on the part of the working masses com -pelled the leadership of the II 2 International on January 19, 1922, to send a proposal to the Comintern Executive for conven -ing an international conference in the spring of 1922 to considerthe problems of Europe’s economic position and action by the working class against the onset of reaction. 
 p. 
 393 Smena Vekh (Change of Landmarks) a weekly journal published in Paris from October 1921 to March 1922 by a group of White émigré intellectuals. 
 The same group published a collection of articles under this title in Prague in July 1921. 
 A socio-political trend formed around this journal and the collection,which became known as Smenovekhism (its ideologists were N. 
 V. 
 Ustryalov, Y. 
 V. 
 Klyuchnikov, S. 
 S. 
 Lukyanov, A. 
 V. 
 Bobrishchev-Pushkin, S. 
 S. 
 Chakhotin, Y. 
 N. 
 Potekhin and others). 
 A slight revival of capitalist elements in Soviet Russia follow -ing the introduction of the New Economic Policy served as thesocial foundation for this trend. 
 The Smena Vekhists regarded the N. 
E. 
P. 
 as an evolution of Soviet rule towards the restoration of capitalism. 
 They stood for co-operation with the Soviet govern -ment in the hope of the Soviet state evolving back into a bourgeoisstate. 
 Some of them were prepared loyally to co-operate with the Soviet government and contribute to the country’s econom -ic revival. 
 The Twelfth All -Russia Conference of the R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
) (August 4 -7, 1922), in its Resolution on Anti -Soviet Parties and Trends, pointed out: “The so -called Smena Vekh trend has so far played and may still play an objectively progressive role. 
 It is rallying those groups of émigrés and Russian intellectuals who have “reconciled” themselves to the Soviet government and are prepared to work with it for reviving the country. 
 To this extent the Smena Vekh trend merits a favourable attitude towards it. 
 At the same time it should never for a moment be forgotten that there are strong tendencies towards bourgeois restoration among its adher -ents, who share with the Mensheviks and the Socialist -Revolu -tionaries the hope that economic concessions will be followed by political concessions towards a bourgeois democracy, etc. 
 ” (The C . 
P. 
S. 
U. 
 in the Resolutions and Decisions of Its Congresses , Conferences and Plenary Meetings of the Central Committee , Part I, 1954, p. 
 671). 
 Eventually, most of the Smena Vekh people sided openly with the counter -revolution. 
 A comment on this trend is given by Lenin in his report to the Eleventh Congress of the R. 
C. 
P. 
 (see present edition, Vol. 
 33, p. 
 285 -86). 
 p. 
 394 Lenin’s note to the Politbureau followed the publication on February 2, 1922, in Izvestia of a telegram from Warsaw reporting the gist of Parvus’s pamphlet Der wirtschaftliche Rettungsweg in which its author justified the annexationist plans of German imperialism in the East, plans for colonial enslavement of the peoples of Soviet Russia. 
 There, in Eastern Europe, Parvus wrote, “the way is open for German expansion, for German might, for German thrift ”. 
 Lenin’s motion was adopted by the Politbureau on February 8. 
 After investigations into this matter the Politbureau passed a decision on March 11, 1922 (see the next document).

 Publication started on Febru -ary 1, 1922. 
 Lenin’s motion (see the next document) was put before the Politbureau at its meeting on February 15, 1922. 
 A decision was passed “To require the editorial board of Kooperativnoye Dyelo to submit to the Politbureau within three days an explana -tion in writing concerning the newspaper’s publication, its character, the composition of its editorial board, staff and con -tributors” (Central Party Archives, Institute of Marxism -Lenin -ism of the C.

 The question was dealt with a second time on February 22, when it was decided to postpone the closing down of the newspaper for a fortnight. 
 A final decision was reached in May, the newspaper Kooperativnoye Dyelo being converted into a weekly. 
 p. 
 398 The first extended plenary meeting of the Comintern Executive was held in Moscow from February 21 to March 4, 1922. 
 It was attended by 105 delegates from 36 countries. 
 The highlight of the meeting was the question of the tactics of the united front. 
 In addition, the meeting heard a report on the situation within the various sections of the Comintern, and other questions. 
 The meeting adopted the theses on the struggle against war and the war menace, the theses on the New Economic Policy, a decision on the tactics of the united front, a resolution on the participation of the Comintern in the proposed conference of the three Inter -nationals, and a number of other documents. 
 Lenin did not sit in at the meeting owing to ill -health, but he took an active part in preparing the meeting and elaborated the tactics for the Comintern delegation to the conference of the three Internationals (see pp. 
 393 -94, 406, etc. 
 of this volume). 
 Lenin’s proposed amendments to the draft resolution on parti -cipation in the conference of the three Internationals were adoptedby the Politbureau of the C.

 on February 23, 1922. 
 A resolution on this point was adopted by the first plenary meeting of the Comintern Executive on March 4, 1922. 
 p.

 The question regarding recognition of the Soviet government should454 455 456 457 458 459 460 461 462 463be raised not at the beginning but at the close of the conference (after attempts had been made to reach an economic agreement), and no ultimatum should be made of it; 2. 
 Centrosoyuz , the agri -cultural co -operative , etc. 
, should not be put forward at the con -ference in the capacity of subjects (contracting parties) (as Krasin suggests), and only a single subject—the Russian state should be taken into consideration” (Central Party Archives, Institute of Marxism -Leninism of the C.

 Zinoviev drafted and sent to Lenin on March 14, 1922, with a request to express his opinion on them before the draft was submitted to the Comintern Executive. 
 These directives, amended in accordance with Lenin’s remarks and proposals, were approved by the Politbureau, and unani-mously endorsed by the Comintern Executive on March 17. 
 p. 
 406 The Politbureau adopted Lenin’s proposal on March 18, 1922. 
 p. 
 408 Lenin’s letter was written in connection with the following incident. 
 Following numerous complaints of abuses practised in the Central Housing Department of the Moscow Soviet, an inspec -tion of this department was undertaken. 
 Similar complaintshaving been received addressed to Lenin, the inspection was carried out with the close co-operation of the C. 
P. 
C. 
’s Business Manager (A. 
 A. 
 Divilkovsky). 
 The inspection revealed abuses practised by a number of top members of the staff of the Central Housing Department with the connivance of the Department Chief of the Moscow Communal Services Sovetnikov, a member of the Party. 
 The Bureau of the Moscow Committee of the R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
), at a joint meeting with the Presidium of the Moscow Soviet on March 14, declared the findings of the inspection com -mission to be unfounded and decided to refer the matter to a new, Party commission for revision. 
 In his letter to N. 
 P. 
 Gorbunov dated March 15, copies of which were forwarded to all members of the Politbureau for their information, Divilkovsky stressed that this decision ran counter to Lenin’s instructions that “bureau -cratic banditism, especially when practised by suspicious ele -ments who have wormed their way into the Party” should be relentlessly prosecuted, and he asked that this decision be reversed and the guilty parties put on trial (Central Party Archives, Institute of Marxism -Leninism of the C. 
C. 
, C.

 When sending his letter to Molotov for members of the Polit -bureau, Lenin wrote on it: “Gorbunov, forward immediately , show to Tsyurupa and Rykov. 
 ”p .

 M. 
 Khinchuk’s letter dated March 17, 1922, asking Lenin for instructions whether or not the question of voluntary principle of membership of the co-operatives should be raised at the forthcoming Fifth Session of the Delegates’ Council of Centrosoyuz. 
 Lenin’s proposals were incorporated in the decision of the Politbureau of May 12, 1922, “On Compulsory Membership, Voluntary Contributions and Unity of Consumers’ Co -operatives”. 
 p. 
 409 All Lenin’s amendments and remarks to the draft declaration for the Soviet delegation to the Genoa Conference submitted by Chicherin were taken into consideration.

 It was attended by 522 voting dele-gates and 164 delegates with a consultative voice. 
 The items on the agenda were: 1) The political report of the Central Committee; 2) The organisational report of the Central Committee; 3) The report of the Auditing Commission; 4) The report of the Central Control Commission; 5) The report of the R.

 Considerable preparatory work for the congress was carried out by the C.

 under Lenin’s direction. 
 The most important docu -ments of the congress were drafted by Lenin or with Lenin’shelp. 
 Lenin opened the congress, delivered the political report of the C.

 The congress adopted the motion with the amendment that advertisements were to be forbidden not in the Party press as a whole, but only in Pravda . 
 Lenin was not in attendance at the moment. 
 Upon hearing of the congress decision he wrote the following note to L. 
 B. 
 Kamenev who had chaired that session: “Comrade Kamenev, I hear that the congress has placed a ban on advertisements in Pravda ? Cannot this be mended, it’s an obvious mistake?” ( Lenin Miscel -lany XIII , 1930, p. 
 29). 
 Kamenev did not think the decision could be altered, and suggested that other ways be found for supporting Pravda . 
 However, after the list of members of the C. 
C. 
 and the Central Control Commission elected by the congress had been announced, Lenin took the floor and proposed that this decision be reversed on the grounds that under the New Economic Policy it would be incorrect to depend upon appropriations for the press being made from the gold fund or revenue receipts. 
 His motion was adopted.

 414 The Conference of the Three Internationals was held in Berlin from April 2 to 5, 1922. 
 A sharp struggle developed at the conference between the representatives of the II and II 2 Internationals on the one hand, and the Communist International on the other. 
 The Comin -tern delegation put forward a proposal that a world congressshould be convened, in which the trade unions and other organi-sations of the workers would participate, to discuss questionsconcerning the fight against the onset of capital, against reaction, and against preparations for new imperialist wars, concerning aid for the rehabilitation of Soviet Russia, the Treaty of Ver-sailles, and the rehabilitation of the devastated areas. 
 The repre -sentatives of the II International, supported by the delegation of the II 2 International, tried to impose unacceptable terms on the Comintern delegation, namely: the separation of Georgia from the Soviet state, renunciation of communist cells in the mass workers’ organisations and the release of political criminals. 
 The Comintern delegation (Bukharin, Radek, and C. 
 Zetkin), while rejecting these terms, nevertheless agreed to the condition that the Soviet authorities would not apply the death penalty in the case of the Right Socialist -Revolutionaries and would allow representatives of the II and II 2 Internationals to attend the trial. 
 In his article “We Have Paid Too Much”, Lenin severely criticised these concessions on the part of the Comintern delega -tion at the Berlin Conference, which he considered erroneous(see present edition, Vol. 
 33, pp. 
 330-34). 
 A general declaration was adopted at the conference recognising the possibility of holding joint meetings and issuing joint state -ments on concrete issues. 
 The declaration called upon all theworking people to hold mass demonstrations during the Genoa Conference with slogans to fight for an eight-hour day, against unemployment, against the onset of capital upon the working class, in defence of the Russian revolution, in aid of Russia’s famine -stricken areas, for the resumption by all states of polit -ical and economic relations with Soviet Russia, for the establish -ment of a united proletarian front in all countries on a national and international scale. 
 The conference went on record for the speedy convocation of a world congress and set up a steering committee of nine members (three from each International) to prepare further conferences and a congress. 
 However, the reformist leadership of the II and II 2 Interna -tionals who accepted this agreement under pressure from thebroad masses of the working people, torpedoed and sabotaged the united struggle of the working class. 
 On May 21, 1922, a num-ber of parties of the II and II 2 Internationals passed a decision to call a world congress at the Hague without the Communists. 
 By this means the reformist leaders blocked the effort to create a united front of the workers. 
 In view of this the Comintern delegation at the meeting of the steering committee on May 23, 473 474 475 4761922, in Berlin, announced its withdrawal from the Committee of Nine. 
 Lenin’s remarks and proposals were made to the following draft decision for the Presidium of the Comintern Executive in connection with the Berlin Conference of the Three Interna -tionals: “1) To step up the campaign against the Mensheviksand Socialist-Revolutionaries throughout the international com -munist press. 
 2) To start making systematic use of the materialof the Berlin Conference for attacking every weak spot of the opponent. 
 3) The general appeals of the Nine not to be issued for the time being. 
 4) In agitation during the demonstration on April 20, to be free-spoken in criticising our opponents. 
 5) The various sections act according to the concrete conditions. 
 6) Any new steps by the delegation to be postponed until the question of ratifying the Berlin results is dealt with” (Central Party Archives, Insti -tute of Marxism -Leninism of the C.

 418 This document was written in connection with the discussion of the question of the foreign trade monopoly which was taking place in leading Party circles at the end of 1921 and during 1922. 
 The monopoly of foreign trade, established by Decree of the Council of People’s Commissars of April 22, 1918, was repeatedly reconfirmed in decisions of the Soviet Government. 
 The adoption of the New Economic Policy and expansion of trade relations with foreign countries necessitated legislative amendments in the sphere of foreign trade. 
 The Theses on Foreign Trade, which A. 
 M. 
 Lezhava, Deputy People’s Commissar for Foreign Trade, drafted at Lenin’s request, stressed the need for strengthening 477the monopoly of foreign trade and determined the conditions for the export and import of goods under the new conditions.

 No. 
 60, March 15, 1922). 
 Despite the decision of the Politbureau, Sokolnikov continued to press his point of view and proposed a plan under which the state corporations, co -operatives, etc. 
 were to be allowed to buy food abroad; M. 
 I. 
 Frumkin, Deputy People’s Commissar for Foreign Trade, also stood for a relaxation of the foreign trade monopoly and proposed leaving only 4 or 5 items of wholesale trade in the hands of the state on the basis of a firm monopoly.

 Ambassador in Germany, testifying to the adverse influence which the Party controversy on the foreign trade monop -oly was having on the business negotiations with foreign capital -ists, Lenin on May 15 wrote the draft decision printed here, together with a letter to Stalin and Frumkin in which he pointed out that “ a formal ban should be put on all talk and nego -tiations and commissions, etc. 
 concerning the relaxation of the foreign trade monopoly” ( Collected Works , Vol. 
 54, Fifth Russian Edition, p. 
 260). 
 Stalin wrote on Lenin’s letter: “I have no objections to a ‘formal ban’ on measures to mitigate the foreign trade monopoly at the present stage. 
 All the same, I think that mitigation is becoming indispensable” (Lenin. 
 A Biography , Moscow, 1966, p. 
 517). 
 Lenin’s draft decision was endorsed by the Politbureau on May 22.

 by the People’s Commissriat for Justice and its discussion at the Third Session of the Ninth Convocation of the All -Russia Central Executive Committee, which took place from May 12 to 26, 1922. 
 The addenda and the first letter were written by Lenin to the draft “Preamble to the Criminal Code of the R.

 I. 
 Kursky, People’s Commissar for Justice. 
 After a talk with Kursky on this question, Lenin wrote his second letter with the rough draft of an additional Article to the Criminal Code. 
 478 479 480Lenin’s proposals were taken into consideration during the later drafting of the section of the Criminal Code dealing with “Counter -Revolutionary Crimes”. 
 The Criminal Code of the R.

 was endorsed by the Third Session of the All -Russia C. 
E. 
C. 
 and put in force on June 1, 1922 (see Collection of Statutes and Decrees of the Workers ’ and Peasants ’ Government (Russ.

 p. 
 419 Lenin’s letter was a reply to the inquiry of the Secretariat of the C.

, R. 
C. 
P. 
, asking whether or not the question of re -ducing the size of the Red Army should be raised at the ThirdSession of the All-Russia C. 
E. 
C. 
 of the Ninth Convocation. 
 A plan for reducing the size of the Red Army was being drafted by the Revolutionary Military Council of the Republic in con -nection with the question of a possible general reduction in arma -ments which had been raised by the Soviet delegation at the Genoa Conference. 
 This question was included in the agenda of the Third Session in a tentative form, depending on the results of the Genoa Conference. 
 On May 24, 1822, the All -Russia C. 
E. 
C. 
 passed a resolution which stated: “Thanks to the line pur -sued by our delegation, the Genoa Conference gives ground forhoping that a serious reduction of the army is possible. 
” The resolution went on to say: “The Genoa Conference, however, has provided no solution to the most pressing problems concerning the relations between the Soviet Republic and the bourgeoisstates, leaving fundamental issues to be dealt with at the Hague .... 
” In view of this the question of reducing the army was removed from the agenda of the Third Session. 
 The session asked the Government and the People’s Commissariat for Military Affairs to table a pertinent motion when the results of the Hague Confer -ence had been ascertained (see Third Session of the All -Russia Central Executive Committee of the Ninth Convocation.

 10 (Russ.

 420 The First Congress of Working Women of Transcaucasia opened in Baku on May 26, 1922. 
 The following reports were made at the congress: development of the women’s movement in Soviet Russia and throughout the world and the tasks of the International Women’s Secretariat; the working women of Transcaucasia and the Third International; the present situation, and others. 
 The congress closed on May 30. 
 Lenin’s greetings to the congress were written in reply to a massage from the working women of Georgia, Armenia and 481Azerbaijan notifying him that he had been elected delegate to the congress of working women of Transcaucasia. 
 The greetings were read out at the opening meeting of the con -gress. 
 p. 
 421 On August 10, 1922, the Politbureau directed the Orgbureau to set up a commission to go into the question of relations between the R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
 and the independent national Soviet Republics in preparation for the next plenary meeting of the Party’s Central Committee. 
 This commission, set up on August 11, consisted of J. 
 V. 
 Stalin, V. 
 V. 
 Kuibyshev, G. 
 K. 
 Orjonikidze, K. 
 G. 
 Ra -kovsky, G. 
 Y. 
 Sokolnikov and representatives of the nationalrepublics—S. 
 A. 
 Agamali-ogly (Azerbaijan), A. 
 F. 
 Myasnikov (Armenia), P. 
 G. 
 Mdivani (Georgia), G. 
 I. 
 Petrovsky (Ukraine), A. 
 G. 
 Chervyakov (Byelorussia) and others. 
 Stalin drafted the commission’s resolution “On the Relations Between the R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
 and the Independent Republics”, which provided for the Ukraine, Byelorussia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Armenia entering the Russian Federation as autonomous repub -lics. 
 Stalin’s draft was forwarded for discussion to the CentralCommittees of the Communist Parties of the Soviet national republics. 
 It was supported by the Central Committees of the Communist Parties of Azerbaijan and Armenia. 
 The C. 
C. 
 of the Georgian Communist Party was against the draft resolution. 
 At its meeting on September 15, 1922, it passed the following decision by a majority vote: “The union in the form of autono-misation of the independent republics proposed on the basis ofStalin’s theses is premature. 
 A union of economic efforts and a common policy are necessary, but all attributes of independence should be preserved. 
” The C. 
C. 
 of the Byelorussian Communist Party went on record for the preservation of treaty relations between the independent republics. 
 The C. 
C. 
 of the Ukrainian C. 
P. 
 did not discuss the draft. 
 The commission met on September 23 and 24, 1922, with V. 
 M. 
 Molotov in the chair. 
 It approved Stalin’s draft (with one abstention—the representative from Georgia). 
 In a special point the commission rejected the resolution of the C. 
C. 
 of the Georgian Communist Party. 
 Stalin’s draft was gone over point by point and approved by a majority with certain minor amend-ments and addenda. 
 Point 2 stating that the decisions of theAll-Russia Central Executive Committee, the Council of People’s Commissars and the Council of Labour and Defence of the R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
 were binding upon the corresponding bodies of the national republics was carried by an 8 to 1 majority (Mdivani voting against and Petrovsky abstaining). 
 The final wording of the commission’s resolution, which Lenin deals with in his letter to the members of the Politbureau, was as follows: “1. 
 It is considered advisable that treaties be concluded between the Soviet Republics of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Armenia and the R. 
S. 
F.

 “Note: Corresponding changes in the constitutions of the Republics mentioned in Point 1 and of the R.

C. 
P. 
, shall not be published, but shall be passed on to the national Central Committees as a circular directive to be enacted through the Central Executive Committee or the Congress of Soviets of the aforementioned republics pending the convocation of an All -Russia Congress of Soviets, at which it is to be declared as thedesire of these republics” (Central Party Archives of the Insti-tute of Marxism -Leninism of the C.

U. 
). 
 On September 25 the commission’s materials (Stalin’s draft, the resolution and minutes of the commission’s meetings, and the resolutions of the Central Committees of the Communist Parties of Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia) were sent to Lenin at Gorki. 
 Simultaneously, without waiting for Lenin s instructions and without the question being considered in the Politbureau, the Secretariat of the C. 
C. 
 sent the commission’s resolution to all the members and alternate members of the C. 
C. 
 in preparation for the latter’s plenary meeting fixed for October 5. 
 After studying the Commission’s material Lenin wrote his letter to the members of the Politbureau which is published in this volume. 
 The letter is dated September 27, apparently this is a slip of the pen, since the Registration Book of Lenin’s Letters, Notes and Instructions bears an entry stating that this letter was forwarded to the members of the Politbureau on September 26; moreover, Lenin’s conversation with Stalin, to which reference is made in the letter, took place on September 26; it can be inferred from this that Lenin’s letter was written on September 26. 
 In his letter to the members of the Politbureau Lenin came out against Stalin’s idea of “autonomisation” of the independent national Soviet Republics and suggested a fundamentally differ -ent way of uniting them by creating a Union of Soviet SocialistRepublics (see also Lenin’s letter “The Question of Nationalities or ‘Autonomisation’”, present edition, Vol. 
 36, pp. 
 605-11). 
 In accordance with Lenin’s proposals the resolution drafted by the C. 
C. 
’s Commission was revised. 
 The new resolution was worded as follows: “1. 
 It is considered necessary that a treaty be concluded between the Ukraine, Byelorussia, the Federation of Transcaucasian Republics and the R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
 for their amalgamation in a Union of Socialist Soviet Republics, each reserving the right to freely secede from membership of the Union. 
 “2. 
 The supreme body of the Union shall be the Union Central Executive Committee consisting of representatives of the central executive committees of the R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
, the Transcaucasian Federation, the Ukraine and Byelorussia pro rata to the popula -tion they represent. 
 “3. 
 The executive organ of the Union C. 
E. 
C. 
 shall be the Union Council of People’s Commissars appointed by the Union C. 
E. 
C. 
 “4. 
 The People’s Commissariats for Foreign Affairs, Foreign Trade, Military Affairs, Railways and Post and Telegraph of the republics and federations comprising the Union shall be merged with those of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the cor -responding commissariats of the Union of Republics having inthe republics and federations their agents and a small staff appoint-ed by the People’s Commissars of the Union by arrangementwith the Central Executive Committees of the federations and republics. 
 “Note: It is considered necessary for the republics concerned to be represented on the corresponding foreign agencies of the 482People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs and the People’s Com -missariat for Foreign Trade. 
 “5. 
 The People’s Commissariats for Finance, Food, National Economy, Labour and Inspection of the republics and federations comprising the Union of Republics, also the central agencies for fighting counter -revolution shall be subject to the directives of the corresponding People’s Commissariats and to the decisions of the Council of People’s Commissars and the Council of Labour and Defence of the Union of Republics. 
 “6. 
 The remaining people’s commissariats comprising the Union of Republics, namely, the Commissariats for Justice, Education, Internal Affairs, Agriculture, Public Health and Social Security shall be considered independent” (Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism -Leninism of the C. 
C. 
 of the C. 
P.

U. 
). 
 On October 6, 1922, the day on which the question of the relations between the R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
 and the independent republics was discussed at the plenary meeting of the C. 
C. 
, Lenin, who was unable to attend the meeting, wrote a note to Kamenev urging the need for combating dominant -nation chauvinism and pro -posing an addendum to the resolution saying that representativesof all the uniting republics should take their turn in presiding at the Union Central Executive Committee (see Collected Works , Fifth [Russian] Edition, Vol. 
 45, p. 
 214). 
 The C. 
C. 
 plenum fully supported Lenin, adopted a resolution in the form of C. 
C. 
 directives based on his proposals, and instruct-ed a new commission to draft a bill on the formation of theU. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
 for submission to the Congress of Soviets. 
 The members of the C. 
C. 
 in their speeches strongly denounced all manifesta-tions of dominant -nation chauvinism. 
 At the same time the plenum rebuffed Mdivani, who at first objected to the formation of the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
 and then insisted on Georgia joining the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
 directly, and not through the Transcaucasian Federation. 
 Guided by Lenin’s instructions, the Central Committee of the Party directed all the subsequent work of uniting the republics. 
 On December 30, 1922, the First All -Union Congress of Soviets met to form the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. 
 p. 
 421 The Fifth All -Russia Congress of the Textile Workers Trade Union was held in Moscow from October 6 to 11, 1922. 
 It was attended by 350 voting delegates and 117 delegates with voice but no vote. 
 The congress discussed the report of the Trade Unions Central Committee, and reports on the state of the textile industry, on the All -Russia Congress of Trade Unions, on the organisational question, on the conditions of labour, on cultural work and the international labour movement among the textile workers. 
 At the opening meeting the delegates elected Lenin honorary chairman of the congress and sent him greetings. 
 On October 9, 1922, they invited Lenin to the congress, and he accepted the invitation. 
 He was unable to attend it, however, as his health had taken a turn for the worse. 
 483 484 485 486Lenin’s message of greeting was read out at the morning session on October 10. 
 The platform committee, on behalf of the delegates, sent him a letter in reply to his greetings. 
 p. 
 423 This document is written on Stalin’s note to the members of the Politbureau proposing addenda to the terms of the concession agreement with L. 
 Urquhart. 
 p. 
 424 The question of the Co -operative Bank was discussed at a meeting of the Politbureau attended by Lenin on November 2, 1922. 
 The Politbureau passed the following decision: “The following theses of Comrade Lenin should be referred as a basis to a committee, which is directed to submit to the Politbureau a written report on fulfilment. 
” The document published in this volume contains Lenin’s note: “ Keep for my talk with Khinchuk ” (L. 
 M. 
 Khinchuk was Chairman of the Board of Centrosoyuz. 
— Ed. 
). 
 p. 
 424 Lenin wrote this letter in reply to the greetings and present received from the Petrograd textile workers, who wrote him: “Dear and deeply respected Vladimir Ilyich . 
 “On the occasion of its anniversary the Petrograd Textile Trust sends you its ardent greetings and begs you to accept a woollen blanket made at one of its mills. 
 “We, Petrograd textile workers, should like the warmth of our modest present to bring you the warmth of our hearts and also to show you that in spite of the extremely worn -out condition of our equipment, in spite of the devastation, the shortages and crises, we are working no worse than before the war, which proves that we can achieve whatever we set out to do. 
 “We wish you, dear Comrade Lenin, good health. 
” p. 
 425 On November 16, 1922, the Politbureau passed a decision to reduce the army in the course of January 1923 from 800,000 to 600,000 men. 
 The plenum of the C. 
C. 
, R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
) held on Decem -ber 18, 1922, confirmed this decision and urged the need for com -pensating this reduction by improving military equipment, for which purpose the C. 
P. 
C. 
 was instructed to find means of quickly normalising the work of the munition factories. 
 The plenum recommended that an appeal be issued in the name of the Tenth All-Russia Congress of Soviets to all nations, emphasising once more the striving of the R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
 towards general disarmament and calling upon the peoples to overcome the resistance which this proposal of the Soviet Republic was meeting on the part of other states. 
 The Tenth All -Russia Congress of Soviets, on behalf of the millions of the working people, once more solemnly confirmed their desire for peace and peaceful labour. 
 “Working people of the world!” ran the appeal of the congress. 
 “All who desire peaceful labour, join your efforts to the efforts 487 488of Soviet Russia in order to secure peace, and safeguard mankind from monstrous and destructive wars!... “The Tenth Congress of Soviets solemnly confirms its line of peaceful policy and calls upon everyone to support this line. 
 Let all the peoples demand peace of their governments. 
 The cause of peace is in the hands of the peoples themselves. 
 To avert the danger of future wars the working people of all the world must unite their efforts. 
 Worn -out, suffering, ruined and starv -ing mankind must have peace secured to them at all cost. 
” p. 
 425 The Russian Colony in the U. 
S. 
A . 
 was estimated at about three million people in the twenties, most of whom were immigrants who had left Russia before the revolution for political, economic or religious motives. 
 The members of the bourgeoisie, nobility and intelligentsia, who had escaped from Russia after the October Socialist Revolution, were an insignificant minority. 
 The different social and economic status of these groups and their different attitudes towards Soviet Russia led to the division of the Russian colony into two hostile camps. 
 One camp was made up of the Society of Friends of Soviet Russia (Russian section), the Society for Technical Aid for Soviet Russia, the Russian sections of the U. 
 S. 
 trade unions, the joint conference of various Russian mutual benefit societies and other progressive workers’ organisations, around which were united the majority of colonists. 
 The other camp was an alliance of various Russian petty -bourgeois and monarchist organisations united around the anti -Soviet news -paper Novoye Russkoye Slovo (The New Russian Word). 
 Lenin’s letter was addressed to that part of the Russian colony in the U. 
S. 
A. 
 which was grouped around the organisations that stood for friendly relations with Soviet Russia. 
 p. 
 425 The agenda of the Fourth Congress of the Communist Interna -tional, which was held from November 5 to December 5, 1922, contained the question of the programme of the Communist International. 
 The Congress had before it the programme drafted by Bukharin and tabled in his own name, and also the draft pro -grammes of the Communist Parties of Bulgaria and Germanyand the “Programme of Action of the Italian Communist Party”. 
 On November 13, in his report “Five Years of the Russian Revo-lution and the Prospects of the World Revolution” Lenin suggestedholding simply a general discussion on all the programmes, “to make the first reading, so to speak” and to get them printed in order to study and prepare the programme more profoundly and thoroughly (see present edition, Vol. 
 33, pp. 
 418-32). 
 During the discussion of these drafts, lively debates revolved around the question of transition and limited demands, as a means of pre -paring the masses for the socialist revolution, for the strugglefor the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
 Bukharin was opposed to the more general transition and limited demands being theoret-ically substantiated in the programme of the Comintern, and even accused of opportunism those who urged the inclusion of these propositions. 
 Bukharin’s point of view was criticised by the congress delegates. 
 The delegation of the R. 
C. 
P. 
 asked the platform committee of the congress to be allowed to discuss the question of the programme within the delegation before the congress passed any decision on it; this request was granted by the congress (see Bulletin of the Fourth Congress of the Commu -nist International No. 
 14 -15, p. 
 31). 
 A meeting of the R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
) delegation Bureau was held on November 20, 1922, at which the proposals printed in this book were drawn up as a draft resolution for the congress. 
 According to available information, the very important points 4 and 5 were dictated by Lenin almost word for word. 
 p. 
 427 The Bureau of the R. 
C. 
P. 
 delegation, at its meeting on Novem -ber 20, 1922, also drew up the following “Statement of the Russian Delegation”: “In view of the fact that the dispute on how the transition demands should be worded and in what part of the programme they should be treated created the wrong impression that the divergence of opinion was on a matter of principle, the Russian delegation lays down unanimously that the inclusion of the transition demands into the programmes of the national sections, their general wording and theoretical substantiation in the general part of the programme cannot be considered as opportunism. 
” This statement was read at the congress meeting on November 21, after which the presiding committee of the congress submitted to the delegates for consideration the proposals drafted by the Bureau of the R. 
C. 
P. 
 delegation, to which slight editorial changes had been made. 
 The congress adopted the proposals as a resolution of the congress (see Bulletin of the Fourth Congress of the Communist International No. 
 18, pp. 
 7 -8).

 p. 
 429 On the morning of December 13 Lenin had two attacks of illness. 
 The doctors ordered him a complete rest. 
 “The doctors,” his sister Maria (M. 
 I. 
 Ulyanova) wrote later, “had great difficulty in persuading Vladimir Ilyich to drop work altogether and go out into the country. 
 Meanwhile he was to lie down for as long as489 490 491 492 493 494 495 496 497 498possible and not go for walks. 
 In the end Vladimir Ilyich agreed to leave town and said “I’ll start winding up my affairs this very day’. 
” From then on Lenin spent several days at home, dictating letters and giving various instructions, anxious to wind up his affairs, to which he attached great importance.

 p. 
 439Here allowance should be made for the scale of prices that ex -isted in 1920. 
 Owing to the continuous growth of emission during the early years of Soviet government, paper money was rapidly depreciating. 
 According to the data of the Currency Board of the People’s Commissariat for Finance of the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
, the value of the gold ruble (taking as equivalent the gold coins of pre -revolution -ary times) averaged 1,633 paper rubles in the first half -year of 1920, rising to 4,083 rubles in the second half -year (see Nashe Denezhnoye Obrashcheniye .

 as a voting delegate by the Fourteenth Petrograd Gubernia Party Confer -ence from the supporters of the “Platform of the Ten”. 
 Thedelegation was unable to attend the congress in its elected form owing to the critical situation in the city and the counter-revolu -tionary mutiny at Kronstadt which had just started. 
 Apparentlyit was in the absence of minutes recording the election of the Petrograd delegation that Lenin wrote in the questionnaire that he had a debating voice. 
 Nevertheless he took part in the voting of all the resolutions and figured in the list of delegates to the Tenth Party Congress as a voting delegate (see Tenth Congress of the R.
